### Japanese Government Issues Statement on Vietnam: Adopting Independent Defense Measures, General Headquarters Announces Vietnamese Breach of Faith

Tokyo, 10th (Central News Agency) – The Japanese Imperial Government convened an extraordinary cabinet meeting at 9:00 AM on the 10th, carefully discussing the fundamental stance based on the new situation in Vietnam. At noon, a statement was issued with the following content: Regarding the issue of joint defense in Vietnam, the Japanese Empire has consistently, based on established conventions, cooperated with French officials and troops in Indochina to defend the area. Recently, due to shifts in the war situation, the attitude of French officials has gradually changed, failing to fulfill their defense responsibilities. Our representatives have repeatedly urged them to reconsider without effect. Therefore, the Japanese forces stationed there have been compelled to take independent defense measures against the current enemy forces, eliminate hostile officials, and coordinate with cooperative individuals to jointly achieve their objective. The Japanese Imperial Government has no territorial ambitions in Vietnam; its sole purpose is to prevent the forces of aggression in East Asia. It will provide assistance to the Vietnamese people in all aspects, promoting the realization of the independence of a nation long suppressed, based on the principles of the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration.

Tokyo, 10th (Central News Agency) – The Japanese General Headquarters announced at 2:00 AM on the 10th: The Japanese garrison in Vietnam, in view of the Vietnamese authorities' breach of faith and inability to jointly defend Indochina, has decided to independently defend the area to sweep away hostile forces, and began necessary measures on the night of March 9th.

### A Portion of Vietnamese Troops and Police Disarmed, Key Facilities Completely Taken Over

Saigon, 10th (Central News Agency) – Japanese Ambassador to Vietnam, Matsumoto, announced at 7:00 PM on the 9th (content similar to General Headquarters' announcement omitted). Furthermore, the Japanese garrison announced at 0:00 AM on March 10th that, as a result of negotiations on the joint Japanese-French defense, a rejection was received on March 9th, and military operations were initiated, disarming a portion of the Vietnamese troops and armed police who resisted the Japanese army, and taking over several important facilities. Moreover, in the Hanoi area, by late night on the 9th, all Vietnamese barracks and key facilities were occupied by Japanese troops, with the main ones being iron bridges, airfields, waterworks, electricity, and printing presses.

### Course of Matsumoto-Decoux Talks

Tokyo, 10th (Central News Agency) – The Japanese Special Envoy Embassy in Vietnam and the military authorities stationed there had adopted a policy of jointly defending the territory with Vietnam. However, recently, the attitude of the Vietnamese government has become increasingly lukewarm, so the Japanese side used legitimate procedures to urge them to reconsider. On the 9th, Ambassador Matsumoto paid a special visit to Governor-General Decoux, holding a historic Matsumoto-Decoux meeting at the Governor-General's residence in Saigon. Ambassador Matsumoto presented the Japanese side's final concrete proposal on the key issue of joint defense of Vietnam, engaging in lengthy consultations with Governor-General Decoux. However, no agreement was reached, and the talks ended in a deadlock. The Japanese military authorities then decided to independently defend Vietnam. Late on the night of the 9th, they decisively took minimal military action, and the measures have been successfully completed.

Saigon, 10th (Central News Agency) – Japanese Ambassador to Vietnam, Matsumoto, visited Governor-General Decoux's residence at 7:00 PM on the 9th, explaining the Japanese demands. He returned to the ambassadorial residence on Rue Catinat at 8:50 PM. At 9:50 PM, a Vietnamese liaison officer came to say that Governor-General Decoux would personally come to respond. However, even though seventeen minutes past the 10:00 PM deadline, an envoy was still sent to deliver a reply, rejecting the Japanese demands, so the Japanese side was forced to begin operations.

### Vietnam's Acts of Bad Faith Towards Japan

Tokyo, 10th (Central News Agency) – The extraordinary measures taken by Japan against the Vietnamese authorities this time were due to the inability to tolerate Vietnam's acts of bad faith. The Japanese army's defense of Indochina was based on the Indochina Defense Agreement concluded on July 29th, Showa 16 (1941), and the Japanese military authorities had consistently and sincerely cooperated closely with Vietnamese officials and troops, devoting all their efforts to defending the area. However, as the war situation evolved, the Vietnamese authorities gradually changed their attitude, maintaining friendly relations with the Japanese authorities on the surface while actually evading cooperation and secretly liaising with the enemy, which necessitated vigilance. Several instances of Vietnam's recent lack of cooperation with Japan are listed below: (1) After Vietnamese troops deployed the main force of garrison troops in important cities around the cities, they actively transported ammunition and fuel from supply depots, preparing for war against Japan. (2) Vietnamese troops gradually increased their cooperation with the US Air Force stationed in the Philippines, India, and Chongqing, plotting to attack the Japanese fleet off the coast of Vietnam. During a meeting in Hanoi on February 20th with Vietnamese military and political leaders, many dared to advocate for immediate war against Japan. (3) The commander of the division stationed in Tokyo told his subordinate officers that Japan and Vietnam were about to begin a decisive battle. (4) Vietnamese troops, in contact with the US Air Force stationed in Chongqing, accepted supplies dropped by US planes in Thai Nguyen, about ten kilometers north of Hanoi, between February 20th and 22nd. (5) When enemy planes attacked Indochina, Vietnamese troops not only did not fire at them, but also treated with favor and sheltered pilots of enemy planes shot down by the Japanese army. Their disrespectful attitude and unreasonable actions are too numerous to mention. Given the above circumstances, it is clear that joint defense of Indochina could not continue. Therefore, Japan repeatedly urged Vietnam to pay attention, but to no avail. The Japanese army then decided to independently take responsibility for the defense of Indochina, while at the same time taking extraordinary military measures.

### Vietnam Forms New Political Party

Hanoi, 10th (Central News Agency) – Various independent groups in Tonkin, Vietnam, previously gathered comrades to work towards the liberation of Indochina. Recently, representatives from various factions held a joint meeting in Hanoi, and after mutual consultation, decided to unite the various groups to form a single political party with the aim of Indochina's independence and cooperation with Japan, to be called the "Greater Vietnam National Alliance." The alliance is composed of twelve executive committee members and twelve advisory committee members.

Weekly Commentary

### Reflections on Reading the *Shen Bao* Editorial "The Way to Save the Chinese Economy"

— Wang Haian

The *Shen Bao* editorial articulates the current economic trends and their ills with penetrating clarity, deeply hitting the crux of the matter. Reading the article "The Way to Save the Chinese Economy" published on March 2nd, I cannot help but feel deeply moved and offer my own thoughts on the subject.

It is a universal principle of competition that only the fittest survive. What is fitness? It is conforming to the external environment to develop one's inherent abilities. We are now in a time of transition, a world of flux. Wartime inevitably brings destruction but also creation. Those who can adapt to reality and contribute to construction will prosper day by day, while those who do the opposite will wither. The rise and fall of a nation are determined by its national economy and the people's livelihood. Therefore, advanced nations constantly strive internally for strategies and externally for responses. What is the way to conform to the current economic situation in our country? It is to implement wartime economic policies. Indeed, many wartime measures cannot be independently planned by the people. If they were to plan independently, they would inevitably be abandoned. Even if they were implemented, the benefits would not be widespread. Therefore, it is necessary to rely on the guidance of economic authorities to manage the overall situation.

In these wartime times, control policies are indeed a necessary economic measure. Control, in simpler terms, is the opposite of laissez-faire. Wartime cannot adopt a laissez-faire approach; control is essential. However, if control is the objective and safeguarding the people's livelihood is the means, then the current ailments of shrinking production and soaring prices may be improved. Looking at various countries in the East and West in recent centuries, they have all vigorously implemented conservation policies in light of the increasing international economic competition, in order to become wealthy and powerful. And this applies not only to the economy but also to politics. The Chinese have traditionally prided themselves on being a great nation that does not seek external help, and they are accustomed to nature's course. Wartime certainly requires control, but in accordance with the sentiments of the Chinese people, it is necessary to prescribe conservation of the people's livelihood as the best policy. The prevailing opinion is that a policy of high grain prices should be adopted for farmers, while a policy of low grain prices should be adopted for the people. And the high degree of control discussed in various newspapers cannot be suitable for the sentiments of our people, and chaotic control can further obstruct the revitalization of our economy. These are all clear manifestations of the argument for conservation. Politics is built on the people's livelihood, and the people's livelihood can also affect politics. The use of politics lies in assessing the times, and it is especially important to carefully examine the history of one's own country, as well as its customs and human nature, in order to devise ways to respond to them, which is what is meant by internal strategies and external responses.

Recently, new municipal facilities have placed their emphasis on national interests and the people's welfare, implementing both short-term and long-term measures. The opinion circles are also diligently and incessantly calling for the stabilization of the people's livelihood, fully demonstrating their responsibility. This shows that those above and those below are already able to work together to form a cohesive force and jointly try to overcome the current difficult situation of upheaval.

Regarding industry and commerce, the period of abnormal prosperity for the business community in this city has faded with time. At this stage, it is necessary to promote increased production while also planning how to prevent and reduce external damage in order to protect the security of shareholders' assets. Internal issues such as the welfare of employees, personnel management, and preparations for necessary evacuation are indeed arduous and vexing tasks for those in charge. However, if during this period of dormancy, they continue to relentlessly reserve technical talents and intensify the cultivation of key personnel, then those who have cultivated for years may be the ones who harvest in the future. After the war, companies such as the newly established Enterprise Development Company and Business Construction Company sprung up like forests in this city. Many of them made genuine investments in factories and combined commerce with industry. However, for those who have a parent organization but no subsidiary organization, even though their balance sheets and profit and loss statements are impressive, it is believed that they will inevitably shift their focus and make practical attempts. Over the years, various businesses have been pleased and prospered due to the sharp rise in prices. However, the current trend of banks tightening lending, the impending evacuation of the population, the lack of smooth transportation, and the weakening of purchasing power are inevitable. It is hoped that in addition to tightening operations, they can implement policies to suppress and stabilize prices. Recently, various industries are about to universally establish price assessment committees. Merchants themselves do not seek to cut their feet to fit the shoes, but they must not allow the authorities to seek prosperity only to cause the seedlings to wither, resulting in a sense of solving problems that only makes them more complicated. It is heard that the General Chamber of Commerce will strengthen its organization again. It is hoped that after the adjustment, it can thoroughly disseminate laws and regulations to the industry, merge each small group into one industry, and unite each industry into a strong and close-knit powerful group that is not exploited by corrupt officials. In terms of matter, the most sparse is gas, which scatters with a single blow. A little further is liquid, which can be controlled by people. Further still is solid, which can withstand toppling without breaking. The evolution of society is also similar. In today's world where the people's livelihood is precarious and uncertain, it is also reliant on this.

### National Government Decides to Fully Cooperate, Implementing Identical Steps Towards Vietnam, Halting French Officials from Performing Duties

Nanjing, 10th (Central News Agency) – The National Government declared: Since the Allied Government of Japan signed the agreement on joint defense of French-held Vietnam with France, it has always kept its promise, cooperating with French officials and troops to fulfill its responsibility of defending Vietnam and safeguarding East Asia. However, in recent times, the attitude of French officials has gradually changed, ultimately refusing to reconsider. The Government of Japan has had no choice but to take emergency measures to stop the actions of its officials.

Based on the spirit of the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty and the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration, the National Government has decided to fully cooperate with this necessary measure taken by the Japanese Government, implementing identical steps, halting French officials from performing their duties, while adopting lenient measures towards French officials, civilians, and their rights and interests within China. Vietnam is at the forefront of East Asia and has a very close relationship with our country. Now that the Vietnamese people can strive to invigorate themselves, defend their land, prevent external aggression, and strive for their own liberation and that of East Asia, the National Government should do its best to provide assistance.

### Thai Authorities Pledge Full National Cooperation with Japanese Forces

Bangkok, 10th (Central News Agency) – Japanese Ambassador to Thailand, Yamamoto, met with the Thai Prime Minister and Foreign Minister on the evening of the 9th, mentioning the new situation on the Indochinese Peninsula, saying: The occurrence of the new situation in Vietnam has no impact whatsoever on the close cooperative and friendly relations between Japan and Thailand. Based on the Japanese-Thai Alliance Treaty, the Japanese government has decided to further strengthen the cooperative relationship between the two countries. At the same time, he also stated that the Thai government should cooperate with the Japanese army in its handling of Vietnam by: (1) Completely disarming any troops and police entering Thai territory from Vietnam. (2) Treating French diplomats and residents in Thailand in the same way as French people residing in Japan. (3) Further promoting the exchange of goods between Vietnam and Thailand in the future. The Thai Prime Minister fully promised to accept the above Japanese proposal. At the same time, the commander of the Japanese army stationed in Thailand also visited the Thai Minister of National Defense and the Commander-in-Chief of the National Defense Forces, requesting that the Thai army cooperate on the following points: (1) Temporarily sealing off the borders between Thailand and Vietnam. (2) Entrusting the Thai government with the complete disposal of French interests in Thailand, with the Japanese army not interfering. The Thai Minister of National Defense and the Commander-in-Chief of the Thai Army fully promised to accept all of this and fully cooperate with the Japanese army.

### Ministry of Interior Announces Policy Overview

Nanjing, 10th (Central News Agency) – The Ministry of Interior held a press conference in the auditorium of the Ministry at 4:00 PM on the 10th. Minister Mei was away on official business, and the Director of the Department of Civil Affairs, Cai Bingtong, represented him.

(2) Regarding police affairs, this includes reorganizing police personnel and discipline, holding training classes for foreign affairs police, and promulgating the Provisional Measures for the Issuance of Residence Permits and Travel Permits to Foreigners in Wartime. (3) Regarding land administration, this includes supervising various provinces and cities in handling land registration, organizing public land to make it legally and economically usable, and taking over land not owned by the occupants transferred by the Allied nations.

### Enemy Planes Night Raid Tokyo, 65 Shot Down, Fires in the City Extinguished by Dawn

Tokyo, 10th (Central News Agency) – The Japanese General Headquarters announced the following at 12:00 PM on the 10th: Between approximately 0:00 AM and 2:40 AM on the 10th, about 130 enemy B-29 aircraft raided Tokyo, indiscriminately bombing various parts of the city, causing fires in various parts of the capital. The fire at the Imperial Household Agency's Main Horse Office was extinguished at 2:35 AM, and the rest were completely extinguished by 8:00 AM. The currently known results of the battle are that 15 aircraft were shot down and about 50 were destroyed.

Tokyo, 10th (Central News Agency) – Approximately 130 enemy B-29 aircraft from the Mariana Islands invaded Tokyo airspace on the night of the 9th, dropping incendiary bombs, causing damage to the Imperial Household Agency's Main Horse Office, residential areas, and civilian houses. The enemy aircraft flew low to conduct the raids. After being intercepted by the Japanese defense forces, about 65 aircraft were shot down and destroyed. Two of the aircraft shot down caught fire over the center of Tokyo and disintegrated in the air.

Tokyo, 10th (Central News Agency) – A US Air Force B-29 bomber squadron raided Tokyo on the late night of the 9th, carrying out the first large-scale night bombing of Tokyo. That night, approximately one hundred enemy aircraft successively invaded the Kanto region from the southern sea, and most of them dropped incendiary bombs on Tokyo. Due to the enemy aircraft's indiscriminate bombing, fires broke out in several places in the city, but they were all extinguished by dawn.

### New Type of American Tank

Lisbon, 10th (Central News Agency) – Reuters quoted a Washington dispatch: The United States has recently built a new type of tank, named "General Pershing." US Army official Patterson said that this is the strongest tank built by the United States, equipped with a 90mm cannon.

### Current Situation of People's Livelihood in Suzhou - Part Three of the Investigation Along the Nanjing-Shanghai Line

— Yi Tang

The subjects of this investigation in various places are security, people's livelihood, and transportation, which are the three things that evacuated citizens from Shanghai are most concerned about. People's livelihood, in other words, is commodity prices. Now, let me give a brief report on the main commodity prices in Suzhou.

Commodity Prices - Generally speaking, commodity prices in Suzhou are lower than in Shanghai, but because it is the location of the provincial capital, with a dense population, high consumption, and low production, commodity prices are higher than in the nearby counties, especially Wuxi. (Prices on March 8th, unit: yuan)

Rice (stone) 52,000

Chestnut firewood (dan) 3,300

Rice straw (dan) 2,600

Soybean oil (jin) 1,100

Pork (jin) 900

Vegetables (jin) 300

Fish (jin) 960

Salt (jin) 300

Flour (bag) 200,000

Noodles (jin) 400

Egg (each) 60

Matches (box) 60

Zhonggaole cigarettes (pack) 320

Shikumen house (three stories)

Monthly rent 31,200

Looking at the table above, the rent for houses is particularly expensive, because the rent for houses in Suzhou is calculated in kind. The rent for a three-story shikumen house is six dou of rice, which, calculated at the current price of rice, amounts to more than 30,000 yuan. It is said that when renting a house for the first time, you have to pay a month's gratuity, plus a deposit of about 70% to 80% of the monthly rent.

Security - The reporter visited the Wu County Government on March 8th. Because Magistrate Shen was transferred, the person in charge of the Baojia Office, Xiao Chengzong, received me. According to him, the security in the city is very good, but the four townships are not very peaceful due to the presence of guerrillas such as the New Fourth Army and the National Salvation Army. However, if ordinary people from Shanghai evacuate to the countryside of Suzhou, it will not cause any problems.

In the past, Shanghai rumors said that troops were stationed in Suzhou City. According to what the reporter saw, this is completely untrue. Suzhou is the same as before, and the citizens do not feel any unease due to the increasingly fierce war. The provincial authorities are making every effort to maintain order in the city, and military police patrol the streets in formation all day long. Any soldiers who do not obey discipline are immediately arrested. On the 7th, five members of our navy were arrested and punished for forcibly purchasing leather shoes at a Huikai leather shoe store in Guanqian. The discipline of the security team and the police is also much better than elsewhere.

Transportation - The Nanjing-Shanghai Railway currently operates about twice a day, and trains are often delayed. Whether traveling from Shanghai to Suzhou or from Suzhou to Shanghai, tickets are difficult to purchase. Often, those who line up to buy tickets are far fewer than those who do not line up but have tickets. However, recently, due to the increase in chestnut prices, porters have suddenly decreased, and the crowding has lessened slightly.

There are boats to various counties near Suzhou, such as Changshu, Wuxi, and Dongting Mountain, Jiaozhi, and Mudu in the county, and there are regular boats. The prices are much cheaper than taking a highway bus. (Sent from Suzhou on March 9th)

### Commemorating the Founding of the Generals' and Officers' Corps: Commander Chen Delivers Instructions and Personally Presides Over the Flag-Raising Ceremony

Nanjing, 10th (Central News Agency) – On the third anniversary of the founding of the Generals' and Officers' Training Corps, Chairman Chen, who also serves as the corps commander, stayed overnight in the corps with Education Director Xiao Shuxuan on the evening of the 9th to show his solidarity with all the students and soldiers. Yesterday morning at 7:00 AM, he personally led everyone in a flag-raising ceremony. After breakfast with all the students and soldiers at 8:30 AM, he convened a meeting with the students of the Generals' and Officers' Team at 9:00 AM to listen to reports and ask questions in detail, providing thorough instructions. He left the school after the commemorative ceremony concluded at approximately 11:00 AM.

Instructions: General Outline

Nanjing, 10th (Central News Agency) – The general outline of Commander Chen's instructions is as follows:

Today is the third anniversary of the founding of this corps, and we are also holding the opening ceremony for the seventh class of the Generals' and Officers' Team and the third class of the Advanced Military Officers' Study Group. I would like to take this opportunity to say a few words to everyone. What is the purpose of this corps bringing all of you commanders from various regions to the central government for training? It is to allow commanders from various regions to understand the implementation of central political and military policies and to receive further spiritual training. What I want everyone to understand is that the government's policies have remained unchanged since the return to the capital. This is of great significance in today's environment and has a great relationship with China's future.

Explanation of the Three Major Guidelines of National Policy

When the government returned to the capital, the national policies were "Peace, Anti-Communism, and National Reconstruction." We must strive for China's freedom in peace, seek China's true unification through anti-communism, and consolidate China's independence through national reconstruction. Therefore, peace, anti-communism, and national reconstruction are about striving for freedom, demanding unification, and consolidating independence. This policy has now laid a considerable foundation, and I hope everyone will not interpret it superficially but recognize the true situation. Secondly, China's participation in the war is voluntary, not at the request of any particular country. Why did I want to participate in the war? Since the defeat in the Opium War a hundred years ago, China has been in a semi-colonial status. Whether it was in commercial ports, military strongholds, or even politics, everything was controlled by imperialism, and nothing was free. Therefore, after the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, we resolutely and voluntarily participated in the war.

The Purpose of Joining the War is to Seek Liberation

Therefore, China's participation in this war is not only for itself but also for the entire East Asian people. Among the East Asian nations, Japan is truly independent, Thailand is semi-independent, and China is nominally independent but actually controlled by many countries. Many places in the East are Western colonies. Therefore, China's Xinhai Revolution was the precursor to demanding freedom. However, after the Xinhai Revolution, it was still manipulated by Western countries, and internal strife continued. The Kuomintang was reorganized in 1924, and the Northern Expedition was launched in 1926. The Northern Expedition was superficially successful, but in reality, it still failed because it was constrained by the United Kingdom and the United States. We want China's freedom and independence, and we must not only drive out British and American imperialism but also drive out all imperialist forces in China. Otherwise, can China still be a complete country? Can it still become a country of the Three Principles of the People? That becomes a question. Therefore, for the sake of national freedom, China must participate in the war. If the war is successful, China can be independent. The current situation is becoming increasingly serious, but for the sake of peace, national reconstruction, the demand for unification, and the principle of independence, no matter how urgent the situation is, as long as we are resolute and work hard, the future of the Republic of China can naturally achieve the realization of the three major principles at the time of the return to the capital. I hope everyone will move forward courageously.

### German Foreign Minister Declares Determination to Complete the War; Will Fight to the End for the Future of Europe

Berlin, 10th (Central News Agency) – After inspecting the front lines and returning to Berlin, German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop had lunch with the envoys of various countries in Berlin, including allied and neutral countries, as well as foreign journalists, and made the following statement: Germany is determined to complete this war with all its strength. The current war situation is slightly unfavorable, and recently there have been speculations about the German government attempting to resolve this situation through political means. This is a misjudgment. The only thing that can prevent the red tide in Europe is the struggle of the German people. If the fighting strength of the German army collapses, then the influence of the red tide will spread without end. It is also a great misconception to say that the Soviet troops entering Germany are extremely disciplined.

### Surprise Attack on Enemy Warships South of Palau; Japanese Maritime Raiders Inflict Losses on the Enemy

### American Troops Cross the Rhine; Fierce Battles Unfold

Berlin, 9th (Central News Agency) – Huitong News Agency: In the past few days, the Western Front has focused on the German bridgeheads on the Rhine River. The American army has only completed its crossing strategy at one point on the east bank of the Rhine. The other efforts are between Bonn and Koblenz. This American attempt to advance south from the east bank of the Rhine was blocked by the German army outside the city of Linz. At the same time, near Wesel, the German army broke the Canadian army's attempt to encircle the German bridgehead. The most difficult battle on the northern part of the Western Front is currently unfolding in the Santen area, where the British army is advancing towards the western suburbs of the city, with flame-throwing tanks as the vanguard. However, the German army is holding firm, making it difficult to succeed. Fierce street fighting is now taking place in Santen. In the Bonn area, the American army is advancing towards the western part of the city and has been quite successful. Street fighting is underway. Lisbon, 4th (Central News Agency) – Huitong News Agency: Another American army has joined the fighting on the Western Front. Details are not yet known.

### The French Government Drafts a World Security Plan

Lisbon, 10th (Central News Agency) – Huitong News Agency: According to news from Vichy, the French government has now drafted a proposal for an improved world security plan based on Dumbarton Oaks and Yalta, and will submit it to the countries participating in the San Francisco Conference. At the same time, France will try to win over the smaller countries to counter the "three powers." It is said that France's proposal calls for changes to treaties such as the Franco-Soviet treaty, changes to the organization of the World Security Council, and the establishment of an international army, among other things.

### Argentina Will Make a Major Announcement Regarding the Pan-American Union

Lisbon, 10th (Central News Agency) – Huitong News Agency: Argentina is about to rejoin the Pan-American Union, and it is expected that diplomatic relations with the American countries will be restored soon.

### Chief of Staff Bao Delivers a Special Broadcast Explaining the Significance of Japanese Army Day

Nanjing, 10th (Central News Agency) – The 10th is Japanese Army Day. Bao, the Chief of Staff of the Military Affairs Commission, gave a special broadcast on the evening of that day. He first explained the significance of Japanese Army Day. During the Russo-Japanese War, Imperial Russia was known for its abundant resources and military strength. Although Japan had undergone the Meiji Restoration, its strength was still far behind. However, the Japanese people, from top to bottom, upheld the spirit of loyalty to the Emperor and were determined to die to win. In the end, they defeated Imperial Russia and established a brilliant war record in the history of East Asian warfare. He then said that the Greater East Asia War has reached the final decisive stage. He firmly believes that Japan not only has the belief in victory but also the determination to die to win, as it did during the Russo-Japanese War. Other allied nations also have the same belief in defeating the United States and Britain and will unleash unlimited fighting power. Therefore, the Greater East Asia War will surely be won in the near future. Finally, he said that in commemorating Japanese Army Day, he hopes that the people will strengthen their belief in victory and complete the war as soon as possible.

### French Military Police Stationed in Shanghai Were Disarmed Yesterday; Japanese Army Takes Necessary Measures to Complete Satisfactorily

The Japanese army stationed in Shanghai announced at 4:00 PM on Wednesday, March 10th: "In response to the measures taken by the Japanese army stationed in Vietnam against the Vietnamese French authorities, the Japanese army stationed in Shanghai disarmed the French troops and police in Shanghai today, which has now been successfully completed." In order to eliminate the enemy's conspiracies with the Vietnamese authorities and to eliminate the hostile colors in East Asia, the Japanese army stationed in Vietnam took necessary measures late at night on the 9th. In response to this action, the Japanese army stationed here disarmed the French troops and police in this city yesterday morning (10th).

No Resistance Occurred

According to the announcement by the Japanese army stationed in Saigon, some French military police in that area resisted the Japanese army. However, there was no resistance from the French troops and police stationed in Shanghai, and the process proceeded smoothly in a peaceful atmosphere. It is reported that before the concession was taken over, the French troops stationed in this city were stationed in the French concessions in the Yangtze River basin in the name of protecting French interests. Most of them were Annamese soldiers. After the National Government took over the concession, they were reorganized into the Vietnamese army and all concentrated in Shanghai in order to be withdrawn to Vietnam. After this measure, these troops and police officers will be treated as ordinary French citizens. However, in view of their past actions, they will not be allowed to have contact with people from other countries in the future.

Diplomatic Negotiations Cease

In addition to these armed groups, ordinary French residents who are not considered hostile will still adhere to the spirit of joint defense between Japan and Vietnam. Special leniency measures will be taken for general cooperators, including the protection of their lives and property and restrictions on residence. In addition to the disarming of the French army, restrictions have also been placed on communications. However, ordinary clear-text telegrams are still allowed to be used, which shows the leniency of the Japanese side. It is also expected that diplomatic negotiations between Chinese and Japanese agencies and French consular affairs will also cease.

Inspection of the Former French Concession

After the Japanese army disarmed the French troops in Shanghai and confiscated their military equipment, the reporter drove around the former French Concession for a week. He witnessed a peaceful atmosphere in the French barracks under the protection of the Japanese army. The French soldiers were still leisurely lying on the grass in the sports field, whistling. A large pile of military equipment was stacked on the side of the sports field. Looking at their attitude, there was no mention of military discipline or military law. In the hearts of every soldier, there was no sense of war at all, just like the bayonets had been removed from their waists. I went into Gujiazhai Park and couldn't find a single French person. It was all Chinese people sitting idly in the warm sunlight. This scene reminded the reporter that the East Asia of East Asians was about to arrive. Stepping out of the park, there were yellow military trucks of the Japanese army dragging French tanks on the road. The line seemed very long, but they were just old-fashioned tanks. People watching the excitement on the roadside sent them off with surprised eyes. When the reporter embarked on his journey, he deeply felt that the East Asia of East Asians was about to arrive.

### Statement by the Japanese Army Authorities in Shanghai

The Japanese army authorities in Shanghai issued the following statement regarding the disposal of French troops and police in Shanghai:

"The local Japanese army implemented the disarmament of the French troops and police stationed in Shanghai this morning (10th). We deeply regret taking this measure, but it is unavoidable.

Our army stationed here requested the Vietnamese authorities to fulfill the previously agreed joint defense agreement in view of the current situation. However, the Vietnamese side lacked sincerity and refused our request. Therefore, we had to resort to partial military action.

The French troops and police in Shanghai lost their basis for existence after the transfer of the concession last year and have been incorporated into the Vietnamese army. Therefore, in order to prevent any incidents from occurring in Shanghai due to the situation in Vietnam, the local army, in response to the measures taken by the army stationed in Vietnam today, expresses its deep sympathy to the French army stationed in Shanghai, especially the French residents. The French authorities stationed in Shanghai recognized our army's true intentions and accepted our demands, allowing the measures to be carried out peacefully without any disputes. This is commendable for maintaining the security of Shanghai. The military authorities do not regard the French side, which holds a cooperative attitude, as an enemy. What we hope for now is that the French troops and French expatriates will recognize the intentions of the Japanese army, refrain from acting rashly, trust the Japanese army, and live in peace."

### Social Welfare Bureau Promotes Relief Work; Director Zhou Speaks at a Press Conference

The 7th press conference organized by the Municipal Propaganda Department was held as usual at 2:30 PM yesterday in the Municipal Government Conference Room. More than a dozen reporters from various newspapers attended. Director Zhou of the Social Welfare Bureau attended to answer questions raised by the various newspapers regarding the bureau's recent administrative policies. The gist of his remarks is recorded below:

The bureau's administrative policies are all being implemented step by step in accordance with the mayor's instructions. We are now planning to start reorganizing the city's public welfare organizations and temples. Many charitable undertakings are carried out by the above-mentioned charitable organizations, which benefit the people. However, they often have to appeal to the outside world for fundraising due to lack of funds. Although they cannot be implemented according to the budget, the results are still enough to maintain their charitable undertakings. Their spirit of struggling to manage is admirable. In the past, general temples often spent huge sums of money to decorate the temples, entirely for their own interests, which is deeply regrettable. Therefore, in my opinion, if temples can carry out relief work for the poor people and seek the welfare of the people in the future, then it will be in line with the original intention of compassion. The bureau has also participated in the winter relief work to provide porridge and the population evacuation work. Regarding the issue of population evacuation, the bureau had already discussed it with various hometown associations and formulated a plan, which has now been submitted to the Population Evacuation Committee. As for the recent factory closures due to reduced electricity, resulting in more unemployment, the bureau, in accordance with the Labor Law, has proposed to the factories that in addition to paying this month's salary as usual, the total amount of salary subsidies that should be received this month should be issued for three months so that the unemployed can temporarily maintain their lives. At present, landlords often increase the burden on tenants for various reasons, resulting in disputes, which are mediated in accordance with the Wartime Special Leasing Law.

### The Bureau of Education Bans Bad Reading Material

Director Dai of the Bureau of Education, in view of the fact that various bookstores in the city publish various popular reading materials, many of which contain educational significance, while some are absurd and teach theft and obscenity, specially set up a review committee in accordance with the Interim Measures for Banning Bad Popular Reading Materials promulgated by the Ministry of Education. In addition to serving as the director of the committee, he also hired relevant personnel from all aspects to serve as members. The first meeting was officially established and held at the Bureau of Education on the 7th. The committee members present included Ling Dating (Municipal Government), Yao Jiagui (Police Bureau), Zhu Tai (Propaganda Department), Yang Zheng (Municipal Party Department), Song Yongsun, Wu Chuiying (Bureau of Education), Huang Peikun (Municipal Library), and Chen Jiwu (People's Education Center). Director Dai chaired the meeting, reported on the organization process, and announced the organizational rules of the review committee, the interim measures promulgated by the ministry, and the implementing rules. Finally, the committee discussed the methods for carrying out its work. The following is an excerpt of the interim measures promulgated by the ministry: (1) All bookstores, printing houses, shops, and vendors throughout the country that sell or rent bad popular reading materials shall be banned in accordance with these measures. (2) The types of popular reading materials referred to in these measures are: (1) novels, (2) publications (periodic or irregular), (3) ballad books, (4) comic strips, (5) fancy paper.

### It is hoped that the air defense equipment in public places will be improved; In order to cope with contingencies

The Municipal Civil Air Defense Headquarters stated that major buildings and mansions, as well as public places such as hotels, apartments, guesthouses, and theaters, do not pay much attention to the installation of air defense equipment. If yellow sand and clear water, as well as fire extinguishers, etc., are not prepared, it will inevitably cause extreme difficulties in extinguishing fires when attacked by incendiary bombs. At the same time, although there are fire exits, most of them are locked, which is extremely dangerous in case of emergency. Therefore, the air defense authorities hope to improve it in order to cope with emergencies.

It was also reported that 500 Baojia personnel from various Baojia districts would participate in the memorial ceremony for the anniversary of the death of the Father of the Nation at Daguanming at 9:00 am, and five people from each district would go to the Bund Park to participate in the tree planting ceremony.

Secretary-General Luo Serves as Director of the Municipal Baojia Committee

In the past, due to the lack of unified administration in this city, the municipal government established the Municipal Government Baojia Committee to implement unified command of the Baojia in the Nanshi, Zhabei, and Huxi districts, while the original district (including the former District One and District Eight) was supervised by the Urban Baojia Committee established by the Municipal Police Bureau. Now that the municipal administration has been unified, and the Baojia in the Huxi, Nanshi, and Zhabei districts have been successively taken over and merged by the Baojia Office of the Municipal Police Bureau, the Urban Baojia Committee will adjust its organization in order to achieve smooth coordination and cooperation with public opinion, so as to achieve unification. Before the laws and regulations are unified and the organization is enriched, Secretary-General Luo of the Municipal Government is specially invited to serve as the director of the committee, so the work of the Urban Baojia Committee will be further strengthened and more fully developed in the future.

### Security Command Executes Three Guerrilla Bandits

Guerrilla bandits Wei Xiangfa, Zhu Genquan, and Yao Jinfa have been disturbing local public security in the Nanhui area. In August last year, Wei Bandit, under the alias Zhu Qinlong, incited military rebellion in Pudong, while Zhu and Yao Bandits simultaneously colluded with Li Xiong, Shang Yongnian, Zhang Genlong, Wu, and others who were on the run, and robbed firearms from the Zhoujiadu Police Station in Pudong. They were subsequently arrested and transferred to the headquarters by the investigation team of the Municipal Security Command. After interrogation, the crimes committed were confirmed to be true, and they were sentenced to death. With the special permission of the Military Affairs Commission, the three bandits, including Wei Bandit, were taken from prison at 12:00 noon yesterday, their identities were verified, and they were tied and taken to the execution ground on Zhongshan Road and executed by firing squad to demonstrate a stern warning.

### Post Office Explains Reasons for Mail Delivery Delay, Strengthening Delivery Organization

According to the local post office: Recently, the public has made many criticisms about mail delivery delays or undelivered mail. It has been found that the current mail delivery cannot be as satisfactory as people wish, which is actually due to the fact that the traffic conditions are not what they used to be. For example, the scarcity of ships, the abnormal operation of vehicles, etc., all cause delays in mail en route. According to recent surveys, delays in mail from other ports due to the above reasons occur every day, and even mail from Beijing and Hangzhou is sometimes delayed for two or three days before arriving. As for local mail, according to recent survey results, except for delays due to unexpected accidents or special reasons why mail cannot be delivered quickly, there are no other delays. The bureau has recently strengthened the delivery organization, and it is expected that deliveries will be made as soon as possible in the future. It is hoped that the public will retain the original envelopes for any delayed mail received. Send them directly to the Document Group of the Shanghai Postal Administration (please write "Postal Affairs" on the letter, no need to affix stamps) so that the cause can be traced and rectified. As for unregistered mail, according to the records, due to mail blockages, many mails from more distant bureaus have not yet arrived. If mail sent to other ports has not been received, it is also hoped that the sender will list the detailed items sent, such as the type of mail, the date of mailing, the place of mailing, the name and address of the recipient, the number of registered or express mail, etc., to the delivery bureau so that they can be traced in order and answered in detail. It is hoped that all sectors will pay attention.

### Elementary School Students Undergo Diphtheria Vaccination

Recently, diphtheria has been prevalent, and many cases have been found in schools. In order to prevent the invasion, the Municipal Health Bureau is conducting diphtheria toxoid injections for elementary school students. The cost of the medicine is borne by the students themselves, at 200 yuan per person. The Education Bureau has ordered all municipal elementary schools to comply.

### Incense and Candle Tax Office Officially Established

Since the Shanghai Special Municipality Incense and Candle Tax Office of the Ministry of Finance was approved to handle the incense and candle tax in this city and its affiliated counties and districts, the promotion of tax administration has been improving day by day. All incense merchants once resisted payment, but after the office sent personnel to urge collection, they have all paid taxes in accordance with the regulations. The trial period of the office has now expired for three months. The Ministry of Finance has approved the office to formally undertake the work because the trial operation of the office has achieved remarkable results and the cooperation in increasing national tax revenue is commendable. In addition to continuing to appoint Wang Tanglin as the director, Zhu Zhengdong is also appointed as the deputy director. It is reported that after receiving the order, the office will abide by the regulations and open for regular office hours, and notify all incense and candle industry merchants under its jurisdiction to pay in accordance with the regulations, and must not neglect, so as not to hinder tax revenue.

### Central Market Tour

— Xi

The recent threat of vegetable prices to Shanghai citizens is indeed very serious. In order to know the recent vegetable price situation, the reporter specially went to the Central Market to visit. The Central Market is located on North Xizang Road, only forty or fifty steps away from the Xizang Road Bridge. As soon as you enter, you can see rows of straw sheds erected in the square, which is exactly at 7:30 in the morning. Inside, there is a lot of noise, and some vegetable vendors and rural women are crowding in. When the reporter walked into the market, he saw a wooden sign facing him, which read: Shanghai Special Municipality Central Market Wholesale Price List (price is calculated per市斤 [jin, approximately 500g or 1.1 lbs]). Another line of small characters reads: From March 9th to March 13th, year 34.

In order to further understand the truth, the reporter chatted with an old vegetable vendor. He was very friendly and talked endlessly like a family treasure. Here I discovered the simplicity of Chinese farmers. According to him: The official price cannot be used as a standard. The price of vegetables varies greatly depending on the weather and climate, and some things are in short supply and are needed, so the price exceeds the limit price; and others? Because they are easy to rot or arrive in large quantities, they are often lower than the limit price. It is not very reasonable to stipulate a certain price for vegetables from what day to what day. Because of this, the official price has become a mere formality.

Vegetable prices have fallen because the weather has turned warm in the past two days, and vegetables are growing very fast, and those that have already been pulled out are easy to rot and turn yellow, so the price has also plummeted. For example, the official price of green rape is 385 yuan per jin, but in fact it only costs 180 yuan; the official price of spinach is 226 yuan per jin, but in fact it only costs 150 yuan; the official price of yellow芽菜 (a type of Chinese cabbage) is as high as 509 yuan per jin, but because most citizens cannot afford it, the price is uselessly high. Yellow芽菜 is transported from Jiangbei or Qingdao and other remote places, and the loss is very large. It cannot be stored for a long time, and cannot be waited for a good price like other things such as rice. So it has to be sold at a reduced price. Now it can only be bought for 350 yuan per jin, but there are still very few people who want it; the official price of 塌棵菜 (another type of Chinese cabbage) is 385 yuan per jin, but in fact it can only be sold for more than 200 yuan. 韭芽 (garlic chives) are transported from Hangzhou by train. Because trains are sometimes delayed, the price inevitably rises. As soon as the train arrives, it immediately falls. As for芋艿 (taro), the official price is 226 yuan, but now it is not willing to sell for less than 300 yuan per jin. 山芋 (sweet potato) seems to be 113 yuan per jin, but in fact it has to be sold for 120 yuan to 150 yuan. This is because some people often use it as food, and the price starts to rise when there is a large demand.

The old vegetable vendor couldn't help but sighed at the end: "The golden age of vegetables has passed, and the purchasing power of the common people is indeed too weak! Our industry has reached the point of decline like other industries!"

Economic Cafeteria The Central Market has a building facing Suzhou Creek, where the offices of various industry associations and brokers are located. There are no less than twenty or thirty red, blue, large, and small magnetic signs at the entrance of the stairs. Among them, a price advertisement for the "Central Economic Cafeteria" is newly posted. The reporter was attracted by its low price, so he went up to the second floor and easily found the cafeteria. This is a large room about six 丈 [zhàng, approximately 3.3 meters] long and four 丈 wide, with seven or eight畏 (unsure of this character, potentially incorrectly identified) tables sparsely placed inside. Each table can seat six people. There are also five or six square tables, with soy sauce bottles, pepper bottles, and other condiments neatly placed on the tables. One corner of the room is the kitchen. There is a cashier's table at the door. The administrator of the cafeteria said that the cafeteria has been operating for five months and is managed by the Central Market authorities. Because there is a subsidy from the market, it is much cheaper than outside. Its prices are: Grade A meal 330 yuan per bowl, Grade B meal 280 yuan per bowl, Spicy Sauce Rice 500 yuan per serving, Savory Rice Soup 380 yuan per serving, Soup Noodles 290 yuan per bowl, Fried Noodles 350 yuan per bowl. In the morning, there are also snacks for sale, steamed buns 220 yuan for ten, and dumplings 220 yuan for ten. The lunch opening time is from 11:30 am to 2:30 pm. Although this is for the market staff, it also welcomes outsiders to eat, but a surcharge of 10% will be added. However, the small accounts and other expenses here are not charged. Yesterday, the social service department of this newspaper raised the issue of lunch for office workers. If there is enough time and you don't mind walking this not-too-far road, it is a good idea to go and eat once.

### Business Tax Offices in Various Districts Establish Collection Directors, Set Up Tax Personnel Training Classes

In order to unify tax revenue and increase the city treasury, the Municipal Finance Bureau has submitted a request to the municipal government to implement business tax in the old one to eight districts starting this year. The spring business tax for this year has already begun to be collected. The bureau also recently convened a symposium of various trade associations in the city to explain the significance of imposing business tax and the procedures for merchants to declare and pay taxes. In order to facilitate tax payment by various merchants, the bureau has specially set up six business tax collection offices in the first to eighth districts, and the directors of each office have also been appointed and will start work immediately. The following are the collection directors: Wu Jinghe for the city center district, Tang Jiqing, section chief of the business section of the bureau, concurrently serves as the collection director of the Madang Road district, Qin Yiming for the Taishan Road district, Chai Shilin for the Huxi district, Yi Jiarong for the Zhabei district, and Li Zhengzhao for the Hongkou district. It is also reported that the bureau regards business tax as an important source of revenue for the city treasury. Whether the total amount of business tax and capital declared by various merchants are declared in accordance with the regulations and truthfully, or whether there are any cases of evasion or theft, should be strictly investigated. The investigation personnel are of great importance to the promotion of business tax and must be competent with tax administration skills. Therefore, the bureau has specially established a tax personnel training class to provide a considerable period of training for the newly recruited staff. They will be assigned investigation work. Luo, the concurrent director, Director Xu of the Secretariat, and Tang, the section chief of the business tax section, serve as instructors for the training class. Classes are held on assigned dates and times. The subjects include (1) spirit and conversation, (2) group discussion, (3) financial administration, (4) tax laws and regulations, (5) business laws and regulations, (6) accounting, (7) official document format, (8) investigation instructions, and (9) individual talks. The training period is two weeks. After the training period, they will be dispatched to undertake investigation work.

### Police Bureau Second Office Convenes Judicial Liaison Meeting

Since this city recovered the concessions and unified police administration, the Third Office of the Police Bureau has been actively planning to improve judicial affairs. However, judicial affairs are of great importance to human rights. If there is any imperfection, not only will the legal rights and interests of the people be unprotected, but also the dignity of national law will be affected. It is learned that the office intends to hold a judicial liaison meeting once a month in order to further study and seek improvement, in the hope of gaining more insights from judicial experts and facilitating business development. It is reported that the first liaison meeting has been scheduled for the 12th (tomorrow) at 3:00 pm in the meeting room on the seventh floor of the police bureau.

### Vegetable Industry Reduces Prices

This city suffered from unusually cold weather last winter, and the market price of vegetables rose sharply, which greatly affected the people's diet. The authorities are extremely concerned. After repeated strict orders, the industry has been striving to suppress and stabilize prices. It is learned that since spring is approaching, the output of vegetables in various places is gradually increasing, and the sources are also more abundant. The industry has ordered its members to reduce the wholesale price by 30% from the highest price last month. Therefore, the market price of vegetables in this city is expected to decline daily.

### Gambling Den Case to be Handled by District Prosecutor's Office

Wang Maoting of No. 147 Weihaiwei Road, "Russian General Assembly," colluded with the chairman of the association, Ge Libaofu, to set up a private gambling den under the guise of the "General Assembly" to gather crowds to gamble, and attempted to bribe Li Guohua, the director of the newly formed sub-bureau in charge, with 300,000 yuan. Director Li reported the bribe and the details of the gambling den to the General Bureau. Li Shiyu, Director of the Third Office of the General Bureau, ordered Liu Shaokui, Section Chief of the Investigation and Trial Section, to join forces with Li Guohua, Director of the Xincheng Sub-bureau, and Liu Junqing, Director of the Third Section, to lead officers and break up the gambling den last month. The owner of the den, Wang Maoting, the manager, Han Huaqing, the chairman, Ge Libaofu, and 174 gamblers were arrested. It is learned that the bureau has completed the investigation and trial of the case and will transfer it to the District Prosecutor's Office in the next few days for investigation and handling in accordance with the law.

### Red Cross Second Hospital Fundraising, Scheduled Charity Football Match, Honor Tickets Divided into 20,000, 15,000, and 3 Types

The Third Hospital of the Chinese Red Cross Society is located at the intersection of Xinzha Road and Jiaozhou Road in this city. It is well-managed, charges are low, and there are many patients seeking treatment. In particular, it is able to be considerate and provide fee reductions and exemptions for indigent inpatients. At a time when prices are soaring and incomes are meager, the hospital's funding has been exhausted and it is no longer sustainable. It is learned that the Shanghai Football Association has sponsored a football match to be held on the 15th of this month at the racecourse on Jing'an Temple Road, and all proceeds from ticket sales will be used for the hospital's expenses. The hospital director, Wen Lanting, has written letters to personally distribute the tickets. There are three types of honor tickets: 20,000, 15,000, and 3. Considering Wen's advanced age, hard work in serving society, and benefiting the people, it is believed that all parties will be able to enthusiastically contribute and achieve satisfactory results.

### Tongde Medical College Establishes Public Clinic

The Tongde Medical College Charity Medical Treatment Committee, in view of the fact that there are countless common people who are suffering from illness and unable to afford treatment.

The clinic is run by Dr. Yu Zhifei and Dr. Shen Chengyuan and is attached to the Tongde Hospital at the intersection of Tongfu Road and Dagu Road.

(7) If any retailer refuses to pay taxes, the wholesaler in charge is permitted to report it to the Committee in writing, which will then be forwarded to the Bureau of Finance for punishment.

(8) If any wholesaler fails to pay taxes by the deadline, the Committee will report it to the Bureau of Finance for punishment.

(9) Those who have already paid the special tax can present their receipts to the Committee for verification, but those who have not paid the full tax must still make up the difference.

The above methods have been announced by the Committee to all wholesalers for compliance. It is also heard that the Bureau of Finance is paying exceptional attention to this reorganization of cigarette consumption tax. Any cigarette merchant who delays or refuses to pay taxes under any pretext, and any cigarette factory that fails to perform diligently, will be punished according to regulations without any leniency, in order to safeguard national taxes.

### Overview of Iwo Jima

A desolate wasteland. The area of Iwo Jima is only twenty square kilometers, shaped like a gourd ladle, with the larger part facing north. This island is completely different in nature from the so-called Father Island and Mother Island groups of the Mount Fuji volcanic system. The highest point is Mount Suribachi at the southern end, 120 meters above sea level. The rest is mostly small hills and plains of about 50 to 100 meters. The ground of this island is not lava, but tuff solidified from the volcanic ash unique to this island. The desert area occupies the southern half of the island. With a gust of wind, the sand dunes immediately change their position, which is extremely desolate.

Wengohama and Nigenhama are directly below Takasago Plateau, up to the Chishima Beach on the west coast, which is the narrowest part of the island, with a width of less than one kilometer. Both the east and west coasts are flat sandy beaches, and the sea waves are particularly calm. From this beach to Mount Suribachi and Chishima Plain, it is necessary to climb high cliffs of 50 meters. The southern half of the island is barren, but the north has villages, tropical plants grow lushly, and it is a good windbreak forest. There are precious timbers such as huangquan and meitan, as well as rare species such as screw pines, as well as cocoa coconuts, wild coconuts, castor oil, agave, and wild bananas and tree melons.

Seawater like boiling water. Along the coast of Kamiyama Beach, Tateiwa Hana, etc., there are crashing waves and steep cliffs. On the surface of Onsenhama, the seawater is like boiling water. On this island, because there are few opportunities to take a bath, making bathing a very precious thing.

The island was formed by submarine volcanic eruptions. The cliffs of the northern soil dan stone retain obvious traces of sea erosion everywhere, indicating that this island was once below sea level, and then rose above the sea. The uplift movement of the ground is about one foot per year, and the coastline changes every year.

This island belongs to the new Quaternary volcanic line. To this day, the embers have not been extinguished. There are sulfur holes that emit a large amount of gas. Near Motoyama, hot water of about 100 degrees Celsius gushes out as long as you dig to a depth of 30 centimeters underground. And there is a lot of sulfur, and the surrounding area is all yellow. In the geothermal area, hot air is steaming, and the heat of the ground is enough to make people unable to sit or lie down for a long time, so it is impossible to get water from digging wells there, and all water depends on rainwater.

Products on the island. It can be said that there is no "soil" on the island, only fine powder of tuff and soil dan stone, and farming is very difficult. Food cannot be self-sufficient. There are only medicinal plants such as takane (raw material for Takakain) and vegetables, pumpkins, watermelons, lemongrass (raw material for lotion), sweet potatoes, sugar cane, bananas, cotton, pineapples, and cucumbers. But there is not a single grain of rice.

The aquatic products in the nearby sea include mackerel and cod, most of which are for consumption on the island. There are several cattle and chickens as livestock. There are absolutely no snakes or scorpions on the island, and there are few mosquitoes. There are no malarial mosquitoes at all. In addition to the absence of sparrows and crows, there are gannets, Chishima birds, albatrosses, etc., which are not only enough to entertain the ears and eyes, but also have droppings that are excellent fertilizers.

### Berlin Under the Threat of War

Since the start of the Red Army's winter offensive, Germany has undoubtedly faced the biggest crisis since the start of the war. The German people are directly exposed to the fierce flames of war, which is also unprecedented. Although the pressure from the Red Army still shows no signs of abating, the desperate resistance of the German army in various war zones has been effective. On the whole, the whirlwind-like anxiety in the first few weeks has now been overcome. In order to prevent the Red Army from breaking through the German defense line, the entire city of the capital Berlin has been fortified. Obstacles have been placed on the main roads in the city. Although it is frequently bombed by the British and American air forces, the damaged transportation networks can be quickly repaired. The German authorities' swift handling is truly admirable.

Intensified thrift. After the start of the Red Army's winter offensive, the German authorities immediately strengthened coal saving measures. Electricity, gas, and automobiles were all saved. The hardship of life in the rear became increasingly severe. However, with Upper Silesia, a coal supply area, becoming a battlefield today, it is inevitable that ordinary citizens find it difficult to obtain fuel. Rooms without stoves were already very cold, and the glass windows were broken due to bombing, so they had to wear coats to work and eat. This is the scene in Berlin today.

The newspapers in the city have also been greatly reorganized, changed to two pages per day. Many have already become victims of the large-scale air raid on February 3, so they have reduced the size of the page and changed to two small pages. News about economy, academics, etc. has disappeared. All records, except for war situation information, are scathing comments on the Three-Power Conference. Recently, the news has been filled with various descriptions of the terrible atrocities of the Red Army witnessed in the Red Army's invasion zone.

Fighting for survival. "No matter what the content of the German settlement case at the Crimean Conference is, the three countries of Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union always want to eliminate Germany. In this urgent crisis today, the people have no other way but to rise up to save the country and save themselves!" Such a painful tone can be seen in the newspapers in Berlin and heard on the radio.

However, the general citizens of Berlin are calm and composed, and the calmness of their attitude is surprising. What will happen when Berlin really turns into a battlefield? I am afraid it will not be clear until then. (Special correspondent Kato, translated from the Mainichi Shimbun, February 16)

### Shanghai Municipal Administration Zhou Weihai Topic Fifth Issue How to Stabilize Prices

The severity of Shanghai's commodity prices can be said to have reached its peak today. All daily necessities are rising day by day, racing towards the summit. Although there has been a slight decline and a period of hovering, it was not long before they began to stir again and rise slowly. This cyclical inflationary trend, based on the experience of the past few years of war, can be said to repeat itself, and the beginning and end are exactly the same. As a result, commodity prices are rising higher and higher, and the people are in dire straits. With a few exceptions, most are mortgaging their possessions to survive and have no way to borrow money. The so-called "starving people in the wild" and "malnourished people," can be said to be a true portrayal of ordinary people today. If current commodity prices cannot be stabilized, people's livelihood cannot be maintained. Since the new Shanghai municipal authorities took over, the people have embraced them with great enthusiasm, and the authorities have indeed held determination to rectify, such as strictly prohibiting corruption, eliminating extortion, improving treatment, recruiting talents, and issuing low-priced rice to supplement the insufficient household rations, and setting prices to seek stability of commodity prices. All these wise measures are worthy of great praise, and in fact, commodity prices did decline and stabilize once. However, it was not long before spring grass grew wildly, and the ashes rekindled. Recently, commodity prices have been rising again, especially rice and gold, which have been jumping even more fiercely. The cyclical inflationary trend of commodity prices has not been eradicated. This is an undeniable fact, which not only fails to meet the authorities' painstaking efforts, but also fails to satisfy the people's hopes. However, the issue of commodity prices is ultimately the center of people's livelihood issues. The severity of commodity price issues is increasing, which means that the pain of people's livelihood has not been relieved. Based on my limited experience, I will briefly express my humble opinions on how to stabilize commodity prices:

(1) Strive for the People's Trust Any undertaking that wants to be done well cannot be supported solely by one or two leaders, and must obtain the obedience and cooperation of all employees. Moreover, it is even more difficult to manage Shanghai's municipal administration well in this complex environment. However, the determination and aspirations of the municipal authorities have already been made clear to the general public. However, the old evil forces cannot disappear and are doing their best to sabotage. The supply of daily necessities is still not on time and in sufficient quantity, which does not meet the needs of the people. The rise in commodity prices, in addition to being cyclical, is not unrelated to this. I remember Mayor Zhou saying, "In times of chaos, use severe punishment." In the past, Wei Yang moved trees and Qin was governed well, and Wu Hou punished traitors and Shu was at peace. Today, human desires are rampant, and integrity and shame are injured. People do not hesitate to be opportunistic and run for profit, hoping to make a fortune, regardless of harming the country or public welfare, laughing at whatever people say, I will make a fortune myself. With this trend in place, commodity prices will never be stabilized. With this trend growing, the people will never have trust. This is what the municipal authorities should clearly understand and strive to overcome all difficulties, rectify discipline, and severely punish those who manipulate commodity prices and raise commodity prices to set an example for others. This can not only show the authorities' determination, but also gain the people's trust. Otherwise, the thunder is loud and the rain is light, and empty words seem to be of no help to the facts!

(2) Limit the Utility of Currency Selfishness and self-interest are human nature. Changing the social atmosphere depends on the authorities' plans. Take the First World War as an example. The facts of the German people pursuing exorbitant profits are countless. However, the situation is different in this war. Rather than saying that it is an improvement in national character, it is better to say that it is effective control. During wartime, the shortage of materials and inflation are unavoidable facts. This is not only the case in our country, but also in Germany and Japan—because they have good control over materials and strict management of commodity prices, and at the same time, the rationing system is sound and established. Regardless of whether people are rich or poor, in addition to using their income to purchase cheap rationed materials to maintain their livelihood, all surplus currency cannot be used to purchase any materials in any market. Currency has been cut off from materials, so commodity prices can be stabilized. The deposits in the hands of the people, in addition to being used for savings or purchasing government bonds, can be said to have no other way out. On the contrary, the government's rationing system should be able to maintain the people's minimum living standards. Even if we take a step back, we should achieve "not worrying about scarcity but worrying about inequality" in order to gain the people's trust and cooperation without any complaints. However, although the value of our country's currency is low, its utility is great. If people cannot obtain a large amount of currency, they cannot maintain their lives or enjoy themselves to the fullest. The root cause of the suffering of the general public is here, and the root cause of rampant corruption is also here. It is certainly difficult to implement a perfect rationing system immediately, and it can be said that it is even more difficult to separate the value of currency from commodity prices immediately. However, in any case, the utility of currency should be greatly limited, such as cracking down on high-end entertainment venues, improving material control, and eliminating black market prices. We must gradually promote their realization so that the utility of the existing currency is reduced and its value is increased, which will have considerable benefits for stabilizing commodity prices!

(3) Eradicate Hoarding Psychology During wartime, inflation and material shortages are normal. People are either afraid of material shortages and purchase them in advance, or predict future situations and hoard them in advance. This can reduce the burden and gain great benefits. It can be said that everything is taken care of for personal consideration. However, there is definitely more than one clever person in the world. If everyone hoards, commodity prices will naturally rise. Of course, this is as desired for individuals. However, because commodity prices rise sharply, the amount of currency issued by the country must expand, and they reciprocate, mutually causing each other. As a result, the rise in commodity prices is competing with the increase in currency issuance. Not only will the national finances go bankrupt, but the general public will also be impoverished. Even those who are hoarding, because of the limitation of individual purchasing power, I am afraid that their gains will still be minimal. Even if they make a fortune and become richer than the country, they are exploiting the people's wealth. The so-called "those who enter illegally will leave illegally," and those who do many unrighteous deeds will not have good results. As Deng Tong starved to death and Shi Chong was executed in the marketplace, there are countless precedents. When they realize that they are burdened by wealth, it is already too late. Moreover, the government can implement various laws and regulations, first conducting a detailed investigation of deposits and hoarding situations, or levying wartime profit taxes, or selling public bonds, or rewarding whistleblowers so that all hoarding profits are confiscated by the government. This is an act that harms others without benefiting oneself. Why do it with such persistence! It is hoped that the authorities can act vigorously and strictly enforce the law, which will not only enrich the national treasury and stabilize commodity prices, but also invisibly curb the hoarding trend.

(4) Disperse Excess Population In order to reduce the damage of wartime air raids, the population of cities should be dispersed immediately. There are precedents in various countries, so I will not discuss them in detail. Shanghai is the only major industrial and commercial city in our country. Whether it is for the safety of life or the continuation of production, dispersing excess population is an inevitable trend. In addition, from an economic point of view, adapting to the current environment, regulating the surplus and deficiency of materials, and dispersing the population of Shanghai are also necessary. Taking Shanghai's rationing system as an example, the reason why it is difficult to satisfy the people is that the diverse origins of the citizens and the insufficient supply of materials are the main reasons. Rather than talking about impossible ways to unblock sources and increase production, it is better to implement population dispersal and reduce needs. After a part of the population is dispersed, the demand for materials will decrease accordingly. All speculators and hoarders will have no way to spread rumors and sway people's minds because there are fewer targets. Furthermore, in terms of Shanghai and Nanjing, the reason why commodity prices are more stable in Nanjing is that the difference in population is of great significance. Therefore, if we can actively disperse the population of Shanghai, it will also have a great effect on stabilizing commodity prices in Shanghai.

The rise in commodity prices has its independence and its interconnectedness. Because it has independence, its price can fluctuate due to its own supply and demand relationship (whether artificial or natural). Due to its interconnectedness, the rise and fall of various commodity prices can often affect other commodity prices or be affected by the rise and fall of other commodity prices. The fact that commodity prices in Shanghai have risen to today's level is not something that happened overnight, so it is by no means something that can be achieved overnight to stabilize them. However, if materials cannot be controlled and rationing cannot be fulfilled, it is difficult for commodity prices to have any hope of stability. It is hoped that the municipal authorities can not avoid difficulties, not be afraid of complaints, comprehensively plan and take practical countermeasures, and then use determination to stabilize commodity prices. No matter how rampant commodity prices are, they can be made to submit.

### The Issue of Fair-Priced Rice Distribution in Schools

— Feeling Disheartened

The municipal authorities, at this critical juncture when the black market price of rice has surpassed the 100,000 yuan mark per picul, have sold a large quantity of rice to various sectors at a fair price of over 37,000 yuan per picul. Although this may not entirely solve the food problem that most threatens the city's people, it undoubtedly has a greater impact on stabilizing the lives of the city's residents than any previous measures aimed at stabilizing the people's livelihood. This is an undeniable fact. Faced with such a reality, we cannot help but be grateful to the municipal authorities for sincerely seeking to alleviate the suffering of the citizens. However, on the other hand, we are deeply saddened and indignant that some unscrupulous individuals are exploiting the opportunity to engage in corruption, creating a situation of "not worrying about scarcity, but worrying about inequality." As a result, the municipal authorities' sincere benevolence towards the people only benefits a few cunning individuals, while the majority of law-abiding citizens are excluded from the benefits. Take the issue of fair-priced rice distribution in schools as an example. The approval of quantities lacks any standard, schools underreport the number of teachers and staff when applying, and the amount of rice distributed among teachers and staff varies from school to school. These are all terrible phenomena that we cannot remain silent about.

Let us first consider the situation when applying for the second phase of fair-priced rice for schools. The staff at the office did not arrive at work until after 10:00 AM, despite the fact that hundreds of people requesting application forms had been waiting. At a time when we are strengthening the wartime system, this kind of phenomenon should not occur. This is the first point. When obtaining application forms, those who arrived first were often rejected by the staff, who claimed that "they had already been issued." However, those who arrived later and were acquainted with the staff could obtain them at will, and the quantity was not limited. Such behavior, which uses personal likes and dislikes as a criterion for handling public affairs, undoubtedly goes against fairness. This is the second point. As the number of applicants increased in the second phase, it became necessary to implement a reduction in the quantity. However, the implementation of the reduction lacked any standard. Some schools that were approved for 12 piculs in the first phase were reduced to 6 piculs in the second phase. Some schools that were approved for 7 piculs in the first phase were also reduced to 6 piculs in the second phase. Others were reduced from 4 piculs to 3 piculs, from 10 piculs to 7 piculs, and from 23 piculs to 21 piculs. What was the basis for such arbitrary approvals? This not only violates fairness but also inevitably leads to misunderstandings. Regarding this point, those responsible for handling fair-priced rice for schools should publicly announce their approval standards. At the same time, they should also publish the number of applicants from each school and the approved quantities in the newspapers to demonstrate transparency. This is the third point.

The above three points require explanation from those in charge of handling fair-priced rice for schools. Secondly, what we should expose is the practice of schools using the method of underreporting numbers to deceive the authorities and obtain extra quantities. It is said that some schools have only 130 students, but the number of teachers and staff reported when applying for fair-priced rice is over 180. As for principals listing their wives, sons, nephews, and other relatives as school employees to increase the amount they can apply for, there are countless examples. Although this phenomenon is caused by the disregard for public interest by unscrupulous villains with moral failings, the failure of those responsible to conduct thorough investigations to expose their deceitful behavior is also a mistake.

In addition, there is no uniform method for distributing fair-priced rice among teachers and staff in various schools. Some distribute it equally, some distribute it based on the number of teaching hours, and others distribute it based on the importance of the position held. Among these three methods, using the number of teaching hours as the distribution standard is the fairest. Since the news of the authorities implementing priority allocation was released, many opportunists have spared no effort to use all kinds of tricks. Some are willing to work entirely on a voluntary basis, teaching one or two hours per week. Their focus is not on the small teaching salary but on obtaining various priority allocation items. Therefore, equal distribution will allow these opportunists to succeed in their schemes, while those who bear the actual responsibility for teaching will be exploited. As for using the importance of the position held as a distribution standard, it is also unfair in practice. A principal should not eat more than others simply because they are the principal, and a teacher should not eat less than others simply because they are a teacher. Therefore, distributing fair-priced rice based on this standard, although it does not imply using one's position to obtain a larger quantity, we believe that the most reasonable distribution standard is based on the teaching hours per week stipulated by the Ministry of Education. For example, if a middle school teacher teaches 20 periods per week, then all teachers who teach 20 periods or more per week should receive one share. Those who teach less than 20 periods but more than 10 periods should receive half a share, and those who teach less than 10 periods should receive a quarter of a share. Full-time staff who are stationed at the school should be counted as one share. This way, the benefits of the government's relief to the education sector can be distributed fairly, according to the amount of effort each educator contributes to education.

The second distribution of fair-priced rice is not far away. I humbly offer the above suggestions and hope that those who are interested will study them together to find a reasonable method.

### Regarding the Evacuation Area of Dongting Mountain

— Na Ya

I read Mr. Xiang Kangyuan's article "Proposal to Open Dongting Mountain as an Evacuation Area for Shanghai Residents" in the previous issue of this publication. I believe that Dongting Mountain is quite suitable as an evacuation area for Shanghai residents, but there are other issues that were not mentioned in the article. I am writing them down here for further discussion.

A. Environmental Issues: The environment of Dongting Mountain is better in the East Mountain than in the West Mountain. The houses in West Mountain are sparsely scattered, not as lively as East Mountain. Although West Mountain produces fruits, tea, fish, shrimp, and vegetables, there are not many trees. Dongting Mountain, although named "Mountain," is actually a small island in Taihu Lake. However, there are several small mountains locally, hence the name "Mountain." At present, half of the trees in the area have been felled, and only a few fruit trees remain. Fuelwood can still be used temporarily, and there are still a small amount of reserves locally, but a solution must be found in the long term.

Dongting Mountain does not produce much grain. Due to the current heavy taxes, there are fewer and fewer farmers. Therefore, the local grain supply relies entirely on imports from other places. However, transporting grain is not something that ordinary people can do. There are many pirate ships in Taihu Lake, and it may be difficult to transport it safely. The only solution is for the government to escort it.

If people move to Dongting Mountain, local prices will inevitably rise. When people from Shanghai and Suzhou fled to Dongting Mountain during the August 13th Incident, local prices rose sharply. This must be prevented.

Local security is currently not guaranteed. Most of the people currently living in the area are unemployed vagrants, and few wealthy people live there. The main reason is that there are too many kidnappers, and wealthy people dare not live there. It is necessary to send troops to station there and select young and strong residents to organize a self-defense force for defense. Taihu Lake has always been a den of bandits, so special attention must be paid. It is best to send troops to wipe them out completely to achieve a permanent solution.

B. Relocation Method: I advocate opening both the East and West Mountains of Dongting Mountain as evacuation areas. Because East Mountain has more houses than West Mountain, and many are vacant, some people with limited financial resources can rent houses in East Mountain to avoid having to build new houses in West Mountain. Wealthy people can invest in building houses on vacant land in both the East and West Mountains.

Wood for building houses must be transported in advance, as there is no wood for building houses locally. The unemployed vagrants living in the mountains in the past dismantled and sold their ancestral houses. Therefore, on the one hand, wood must be transported in advance, and on the other hand, it must be strictly prohibited to dismantle and sell houses again.

From Shanghai to Dongting Mountain, one can go by land to Suzhou, and then by water to Dongting Mountain, or hire a boat directly. If there are no appropriate methods for transportation and along the way protection, evacuation may be extremely difficult.

C. Other Issues: In terms of education, Dongting East Mountain still has a relatively complete primary school, while West Mountain only has a few private schools. If there are many immigrants, more schools must be established. Fortunately, there are many large buildings in East Mountain that can be used to set up middle schools or specialized schools. Secondly, there are very few doctors locally, and if there are many immigrants, it will not be enough. Therefore, doctors are also needed. Furthermore, there is no industry or developed commerce locally. It is very necessary to establish factories and businesses on the mountain.

### Map of the Situation on the Eastern and Western Fronts of Europe

On the Eastern Front, German and Soviet troops are facing each other on the west bank of the Oder River. The Soviet army is using Kolberg, Stargard in Pomerania, and the north bank of the Nietze River east of Küstrin as bases, but there has been no progress to date. On the Western Front, part of the Anglo-American Allied forces has broken through the Siegfried Line, and its foremost troops have invaded the areas along the Rhine River, such as Duisburg, Düsseldorf, Cologne, Bonn, and Koblenz, and have begun crossing the river to fight. However, German resistance has intensified in recent days.

### Rice

— Hou Qianli

Mr. Bai suddenly thought about doing some business.

But Mrs. Bai didn't agree at first:

"You're going to do business again? How much did you lose on that stock last time? You almost didn't get your principal back..."

"It's different this time..." Mr. Bai protested.

"Forget it!" Mrs. Bai stopped him: "I've always said that people like us are never good at doing business, we don't have anything. It's better to be content and not dream of getting rich!"

"But, dear," Mr. Bai warned, "do you know how much we spend in a month? And how much we earn? - In this day and age, who still wants to get rich?"

So Mrs. Bai had nothing to say. She was in charge of the household, how could she not know how much their income and expenses differed these days? If Mr. Bai hadn't been trying everywhere, their family would have starved to death long ago. But thinking about doing business, Mrs. Bai always felt a little disheartened. Not to mention anything else, just take the last time Mrs. Bai sold her only jewelry to let Mr. Bai buy stocks. The result wasn't a complete mess, and they became someone else's victims. This time...

"This time, what do you want to do again?" Mrs. Bai asked with concern.

"Today they said at the bureau that the price of rice is bound to rise in the next few days. I asked a few rice dealers across the street, and it's already a bit more expensive than it was a few days ago. So, I plan to buy one or two piculs of rice. In the future, I'll sell it to the people in our lane."

"Where will you get the capital?" Mrs. Bai's heart turned around a bit.

"I think," Mr. Bai said confidently, "one or two piculs isn't much, 100,000 yuan is enough. I'll discuss it with Lao Lu, and at most, I'll acknowledge a little interest to him. I've calculated that I can pay back the principal and interest within a month, and I can net 50,000 to 60,000."

"What's the use of 50,000 to 60,000?" Mrs. Bai poured a bucket of cold water.

"It's better than nothing, dear!" Mr. Bai said, "After all, people like us are just doing small business with small profits. What big development are we thinking about?"

Without any ambiguity, Mr. Bai calculated the matter very carefully. He planned to buy two piculs of rice and guaranteed that it would double in price in a month. When the momentum was at its highest, he would sell it, and he could get back the principal and interest. Even if he acknowledged an interest of 15%, he could net 50,000 to 60,000 without any problem.

"What's the use of 50,000 to 60,000?" He remembered his wife's words again.

That was true, but he couldn't think about those things now. Mr. Bai thought that he had to act quickly if he wanted to do it.

The next day, as soon as he left the office, he went to find Lao Lu.

"I can't even turn around my own funds, I'm really sorry, old friend!" That gentleman cupped his hands to him, indicating that there was no way.

"The amount is actually limited," Mr. Bai said.

"The amount is indeed not much, but I'm really tight on cash these days. Otherwise, I'll try to think of a way for you, but I'm afraid I'll have to acknowledge a little interest."

"It doesn't matter! Of course, I have to acknowledge interest, please, please."

Two days later, Lao Lu replied to him that he had only managed to get 50,000, and the interest was 20%.

"What a ruthless hand!" Mr. Bai put down the phone and glared at the telephone again.

The clerks and staff in the office were all chirping about the salary increase.

"Lao Bai, have you heard the news?" Someone shouted to him: "I heard that we're getting three more pecks of rice this month - not ration rice, but a rice subsidy."

Mr. Bai shook his head.

"There's no such cheap thing!" The second person replied; "Do you know how much rice costs today? - 64,000!"

Mr. Bai's heart jumped.

"I can't buy two piculs!" he thought, "Damn! I really have to hurry, just buy 100,000 worth."

"64,000?" Someone continued on the other side: "Watch, I won't be named Wu if it doesn't reach 100,000 in the next few days!"

That Mr. Wu was right, the price of rice jumped up day by day, 65,000, 68,000, 72,000, 74,000...

Mr. Bai's heart also jumped up day by day. He was busy inquiring about the price of rice every day, and Mrs. Bai was also worried about the picul of rice they had just bought, it had been raining these days, and she was afraid it would get wet and no one would want it in the future.

But what really worried her was the rice in their own house. There was only a little more than one peck left in the jar, which was only enough for their family to eat for five or six days. What would they do after they finished it, the price of rice outside was so expensive.

"I think we should eat that picul of rice ourselves," she said to her husband.

"You're crazy," Mr. Bai said loudly, "What will we use to pay people back if we eat it all? - I don't think there's a big problem with the rice at home. They say that we have hope of getting a rice subsidy this month. Two pecks, enough to eat for ten days."

"You're just daydreaming," Mrs. Bai muttered.

But in this day and age, daydreaming is really not easy to do. People often find that none of the previous ideals are realized later, and all the early plans are in vain. Just like that clerk Mr. Bai, just as his wife said, he was really good at daydreaming. However, just as he himself said, they were not people who were good at doing business.

A few days passed, there was no news of the rice subsidy from the bureau, but the price of rice was still rising every day, rising and rising.

"It's easy to sell," Mrs. Bai said more than once.

"Early days!" Mr. Bai comforted her: "It's bound to reach 100,000 in these few days!"

"Don't be greedy..."

"Look, you're at it again," Mr. Bai was a little angry: "Saying I'm greedy, what for?"

"But what are we going to do about our family?" Mrs. Bai had to change the subject.

"As long as the rice is sold, everything will be easy to handle."

But the rice was still not sold.

The price of rice came back down!

It came down by 2,000 on the first day, and another 1,000 on the second day, and the third day...

"What to do?" Mrs. Bai was anxious and restless.

"It doesn't matter, it will go back up again. This is an ebb tide, it won't last long, - it will have to rise again."

But this time Mr. Bai didn't see it right, the price of rice actually stopped. - Maybe it will rise again in the future, but at least it stopped moving for a while.

This made Mr. Bai uneasy. He began to regret not selling it when the momentum was at its highest a few days ago. Now it was still in his hands, and he had to acknowledge a big interest. It was really hard on himself to sell it now, after being busy for so many days.

"I think forget it," Mrs. Bai said that same line again: "We're never good at doing business, other people do it well, but when we do it, we're unlucky. If we don't sell it, we don't even have to think about getting our principal back."

"Are we just going to sell it like this!"

"What else can we do if we don't sell it?" This time Mrs. Bai had experience: "Waiting for rice to cook, that's how our family has always been. Now, you're still holding on to it, are you going to borrow money from people again to buy rice for ourselves?"

"Then," Mr. Bai made a decision: "You ask in the lane tomorrow if anyone wants it."

The next day, Mrs. Bai ran to number seventeen as soon as she had time.

"Mother Zhou, do you want rice? The man of our nanny's family brought more than one picul to ask me to ask you."

"What's the price?"

"He said according to the market price, - but, I think it can always be a bit cheaper."

"Alright, but the rice has to be good," the other party said, "Mrs. Bai, you know, these rice dealers are really slippery!"

An hour later, the money and goods were cleared.

Mr. Bai settled the principal and interest with the people, and the remaining money was just enough to buy a few pecks of rice.

He originally planned to buy a pair of leather shoes, but when he went to that store, the price of a size 65 had already changed to 14,500.

Mrs. Bai also originally planned to wait for the money from the rice to use it to make her old coat new, but now, of course, she didn't mention it.

Just like that, Mr. Bai ended this business of his.

### Commemorating the Hundredth Issue of Bai Mao, Part One

— Hu Shengquan

Many people are cursing time, saying how cruel it is, turning all the strong into the old, and only making people feel sad in recollection; however, I want to say, is it not also the merit of time to nurture a fragile infant into a strong and thriving youth, arousing infinite hope? Time itself is not guilty, it is a fair record, showing what is degenerating and what is progressing!

Bai Mao has been published for a hundred issues from its founding to the present. Is it degenerating or progressing? This is a very complicated question. It is difficult to hope that a malnourished child will be perfectly healthy. What time is it now, allowing your songs and cries to excite people's emotions? However, it is still growing strongly, growing. Undoubtedly, its future is bright.

Perhaps some people, looking up at the sky, laughed aloud in their noses after reading one or two issues of Bai Mao, what is this thing! However, I want to tell them, what you are laughing at is precisely the most precious part of Bai Mao. Most of the people who write articles for it regularly are young people with passionate emotions but lacking writing skills. Its growth is not the loneliest, it can receive many, many articles that are not from "writers" every day. To exaggerate a bit, it can be called a rice paddy in the literary world.

Furthermore, Bai Mao is not completely without mature works. There are several young people who love literature and are cultivating it with sweat. When they are serving readers in other publications to the point of impatience, they shouted out sincere voices in Bai Mao. This is not just their articles, but also the beating of their conscience!

Time is a fair record. After a hundred issues, Bai Mao may have a new face in the literary world of Shanghai. Whether it is degenerating or progressing, there will be many fair people to evaluate it. I hope that readers and authors who love Bai Mao will work hard to nurture its growth!

Part Two - Chen Xin

Two years ago, Bai Mao presented its first issue to us. For a hundred issues, as the editor said in the inaugural speech: "Our Bai Mao hopes to be a Bai Mao in the literary world: with a great spirit, extraordinary beauty, and a use that is not a small supplement to people."

Just like its name, Bai Mao is a wild grass, not a famous flower. Naturally, it will not be welcomed by those who admire famous flowers. However, which domestic grass is not grown from wild grass? "The spring breeze blows again," can those famous flowers have such vitality? Can they withstand wind and rain?

Naturally, there are still some unsatisfactory places and some shortcomings in the past hundred issues. However, when we think that almost all the people supporting this garden are young people, these shortcomings should be forgiven, shouldn't they? Moreover, this place is also full of vitality.

Hope is always in the future. Bai Mao is young and full of vigor and vitality. I believe it will grow up quickly.

### The Joyful Ringing - To My Sister

— Cheng Xia

Do not throw to me

That joyful shadow,

When my heart is like a dark deep pond;

Afraid that the branches are swaying,

Gently stroking the desolate waves.

Do not ring on the other side of the wall,

That joyful footsteps,

When my heart is like a cold alley in winter night,

Remembered it,

Then it will also, remember the sorrow.

Afraid of that joyful warm wind,

Shaking up a full of excitement,

Then like a person flying in a dream,

Falling in the lonely wilderness...

Ah, you are holding the silver bell of joy,

And I only hear the untouchable ringing,

It is sad to tell a blind man that the rainbow is beautiful,

That explains,

Why I

Do not speak.

### Complaining

— Mei Mozhi

Young people should be stronger, able to endure hardship, and bear the pain.

Why have we lost this courage that we should possess?

Having not seen each other for years, we unexpectedly meet today. To dispel our lonely feelings, we resort to the ridiculous act of complaining to each other, making the most of this rare opportunity.

Besides pouring out our material and spiritual suffering, besides engaging in aimless pleasantries, besides filling awkward silences with giggles…

What else could allow us to better handle this rather sudden opportunity to talk? It would be better to take such a rare opportunity to thoroughly scrub away the brands of life deeply etched into our hearts. You talk about yours, I talk about mine. Thinking about all of this afterward, it's truly meaningless, but at the time, we were quite serious, even comparing who had it worse, arguing over who was more optimistic or pessimistic.

In these years filled with the smoke of war, young companions are unable to ignite the courage of their youth in the flames. As a result, they are cast into these dark,沉沉 corners, enduring the lashes of life, struggling, hesitating, hoping, and also despairing. Who can avoid having a belly full of complaints in such a situation?

Young people should be stronger, able to endure hardship, and bear the pain. That is what should be, but if we already have so many complaints and constantly force them down, is that a solution? Besides, we usually have no way to complain; we are filled with grief but have no choice but to endure it ourselves.

Then, today, this unexpected opportunity to vent the endless bitterness buried in our hearts—it is quite liberating.

The complaining of young people is ultimately different from that of middle-aged and elderly people. Middle-aged people’s complaints are full of cunning worldliness, while elderly people are merely filled with pity and lamentation.

Young people, however, are unprincipled; they merely vent. Once they realize that complaining is useless and that everything must be solved by themselves, we have hands, brains, and the courage to live. We hope that we will not be worn down by life's trials and lose our passion. We can: endure hardship and bear the pain!

With this self-confidence, then, people who have finished complaining to each other, regain your youthful vitality and tread more practically on the rough paths of life that have caused so many wounds.

### Parting Sorrow

— Hongzi

The sorrow of parting—it stirs up your tears, which cling to your eyelashes like rain threads clinging to a spider's web; your face wears an indelible bitter smile!

Like the delicate sun through the fog,

A melancholic shadow piled thickly.

Dare I say this is the last handshake?

Your fingertips are no warmer than piano keys; loneliness seals your trembling lips,

Grievously spelling out an indefinite "farewell."

Counting the vibrant days of youth,

Just as the train is about to reach its final destination;

It is good to retrieve them from the aging wrinkles in our memory,

Precisely when time has completely devoured us.

### To Bai Mao

— Jiang Shui

In spring,

I once saw seedlings,

In spring,

I once saw blossoms,

In, now—

The third spring

I see

Fruit has formed.

Seedlings

Are born in hardship

And also grow.

We should thank the sower

For allowing the barren land

To have greenery…

Do not want roses

Nor roses

—Those plants from warm rooms.

Here are small flowers

Are weeds

Young and beautiful.

In spring,

In the season when the soil is loosened,

Let the seeds be sown again,

With millions of partners

Cheering for you—

You, young sower!

### Football League Division A: Union to Battle Portuguese Merchants This Morning; Captain Xu Speaks of Firm Resolve to Win

The Football League Division A has reached its final crucial stage. Today at 10 AM, the Union team will battle the Portuguese Merchants at the Racecourse, essentially a championship decider. A lively scene can be expected on Jing'an Road. On the day of this major battle, we will discuss various aspects of this match.

Future Trends Based on Both Teams' Records

In Division A, besides the above two teams, the Overseas Chinese United Association has lost twice, losing four points. The Tung Wah team has lost three times, losing six points. The other teams have lost even more points. None of the aforementioned teams have any hope of winning the championship. Only the Union team has drawn twice, while the Portuguese Merchants have lost once. Both teams are in the best shape, holding the top spots. Today's battle will undoubtedly be decisive. If the Portuguese Merchants win today, they still have a match against Jilin, which they should be able to win easily. Conversely, if the Union team wins today, they have two matches against Tung Wah and Jilin. Winning against Jilin shouldn't be a problem, and Tung Wah will surely give them a break. Then, the Union team can win the championship. The importance of this battle for the championship is evident.

Both Sides Have Their Strengths

Analyzing both sides' strengths, let's start with the Union team. This team is known for its defensive characteristics on the field. Center back Song Jiansheng's clear dribbling is rare among players from other teams. Left and right midfielders Bi Fujin and Guo Yingzhong also have good skills and plenty of energy. This defensive line can be considered solid. On the defensive end, left back Li Tiansheng has attended the World Games, possessing rich experience. Although he is older, his charm doesn't fade, and his battlefield prowess is no less than in his younger years. Right back Wu Qixiang is recently in top form; his skill is unmatched in Shanghai. His quick feet and good positioning are impressive. With his energy restored, he displays his abilities fully and flawlessly. Goalkeeper Liu Xianhan is of average quality. As a result, the Union team's forwards have rarely left a good impression on people. However, this season, with the return of young players Luo Shoufu and Gao Xiuqing, they are striving to improve. Zhou Qilin has also made progress. Consequently, the Union team's front line has become outstanding. Thus, the Union team has become a strong team with excellent offense and defense. The Portuguese Merchants have a considerable history in Shanghai's football scene. Most of the Portuguese players have resided in Shanghai for many years. Therefore, they are exceptionally familiar with the tactics of Chinese teams, enabling them to surprise their opponents. It is especially valuable that the team has intelligence, strategy, and a meticulous style of play, and they are adept at exploiting opponents' weaknesses. On the front line, Bao Xiutuo is the central figure, while the two wings, Fu En V Su Ruo, the former has the highest speed and the latter the clearest ball control and is skilled at crossing. These three are dangerous figures. Among the Portuguese Merchants' center backs, center back Oliveira has the demeanor of a general. Right midfielder A. Ke Lasha is brave but lacks intelligence. Left midfielder Kao Sitan has multiple skills but lacks stamina, so he is not ideal. Defender Ke Lai Tuo is better than Vik Tai. Although Vik Tai has a long history, some people praise him, but I feel he is old and useless, and utterly uncouth, lacking the temperament of a cultured general. Goalkeeper Bo Liman occasionally delivers outstanding performances but lacks consistency. Overall, both sides have their strengths.

It's Hard to Predict the Outcome

Some say the Union team will win because they defeated the Portuguese Merchants 4-2 in the Welfare Cup. In the Union Cup, the Union team was able to overwhelm the strong Overseas Chinese United Association, which had heavily defeated the Portuguese Merchants. The Portuguese Merchants' defense is most afraid of the ferocity of Li Yichen and Zhou Qilin. This statement has its reasons. However, some say the Portuguese Merchants' forwards are sharp and good at deceptive tactics. The Union team's defense may not be able to stop them, so the Portuguese Merchants have a better chance of winning. This is another opinion. Given that this battle is related to the championship, both sides will strive to their utmost. The outcome is hard to predict before the match.

Chatting With Captain Xu About Tactics

Yesterday, I met with Union team captain Xu Wenkui and chatted about the team's recent situation and today's lineup. I will briefly describe it. According to him, the Union team is determined to win. The players have been training hard recently, but Liu Xianhan is recovering from a recent illness, so he lacks confidence. Song Lingsheng is busy with official duties and can't attend. The other players and Captain Xu have been practicing daily, and they are all in normal condition. The starting lineup will be: goalkeeper Liu Xianhan, defenders Wu Qixiang and Li Tiansheng, midfielders Zheng Yingquan, Song Lingsheng, and Qu Yongfu, forwards Xu Wenkui, Gao Baozheng, Li Yichen, Luo Taofu, and Zhou Qilin. The possible changes are that Luo Shoufu doesn't have Gao Xiuqing's recent form, so he will be replaced depending on the situation. If Xu himself feels physically weak, he will be replaced by Fei Chunzhao. If Liu Lianghan is not recovering well from his illness, then Zheng Yingzhong will be the goalkeeper, and Gao Baozheng will be in the midfield line. This shows that the team has considered all aspects, and they have high hopes for defeating the enemy. Captain Xu also talked about tactics. He said that the Portuguese Merchants' most worrisome tactics are wing attacks and central breakthroughs. Therefore, our side will have Qu Yongfu tightly marking Qu Fuen and Wu Qixiang guarding Ding Su Ruo. Qu and Wu are in excellent condition, and they have the ability to do so. The Portuguese Merchants will find it difficult to attack on the wings, and their central breakthrough will be blocked by Song Ling, who is more than capable. If the opponent's attack is lacking, then our team will have more opportunities to attack. With their frequent progress, coupled with Li Yichen's powerful axe, which is difficult for the Portuguese players to resist, if all the players perform normally today, they will have the confidence to defeat the enemy.

### A Word for the Football Association: Training Should Be Given to Inspectors

— Xu Zhihao

Since the Football Association changed personnel this year, the spirit of their work has improved compared to before. This is a fact that the sports community and people from all walks of life have witnessed. However, one point leaves me dissatisfied: to prevent spectators from entering without tickets, the association has hired a large number of inspectors to strictly collect tickets at the entrance. This is a necessary measure, but I have seen that most of the so-called inspectors are untrained ruffians, swaggering about, sometimes making unwarranted accusations against those with passes or player certificates. Conversely, they let in anyone they know. These inconsistencies are commonly seen by people in the know. According to me, in the match between Tung Wah and Huatong at Jiaoyuan, a certain inspector started an argument with me. He then led a large group of inspectors, seemingly wanting to fight me, and spoke rudely, completely untrained and uneducated. Football is a sport, an aspect of physical education, and the audience is also educated. If someone is insulted by an inspector while enjoying the skills of the game, wouldn't they be resentful? Therefore, I dare to express my humble opinion: I urge the Football Association authorities to give these inspectors strict training to demonstrate the value of physical education. I hope the authorities do not neglect the details and do not betray my sincerity.

### Worth Introducing: Three Female Basketball Stars (Skinny Reporter)

The women's basketball scene has unexpectedly flourished this year. Shen Bao has found that the third basketball league has given the audience the impression that veteran players are not regressing, and there are many new players. Previously, this publication published "Two Topics on Female Artists." Based on my personal observations, there are three more heroines that deserve to be written about. Without considering my literary talent, I want to encourage the female players. I heard that the Dahua Sports Association is planning to organize a women's league. I hope the heroines of the city will continue to make progress and raise the level of the sport.

Nie Baozhu

Nie Baozhu is the cornerstone of the Xuebai team's defense and is a high-achieving student at Minli Girls' High School. Recalling Xuebai's first battle against the Yuan team, Miss Nie did not show any timidity despite facing a strong opponent. Her left block and interception made the Yuan team wary. She is excellent at occupying a standing position on the court. Therefore, although she does not have the best elasticity, she still deserves nine out of ten. More praiseworthy is that Miss Nie can always fight seriously and is not affected by winning or losing. Therefore, she has shown improvement in every match. If she continues to work hard, Miss Nie can be compared to the best defender in Shanghai, Miss Wang Weizhen. Let her strive!

Wu Meiyi

The Yikang team is a newly emerging team, but their record is quite impressive. Miss Wu is the captain of the team, playing as a left defender. She is skilled and not inferior to the average veteran. The reporter clearly remembers in the second round of the match between the team and the Yuan team, she was responsible for guarding Miss Huang Mingyuan. In the first half, she played to her abilities, and Yikang did not lose many points. Unfortunately, she could not continue to play in the second half due to physical reasons, and then Miss Huang's performance was seen again. This is enough to prove that Wu's skills are indeed good. Wu's advantages are her lively body, fast running, agile evasion, and accurate passing. She has these basic conditions of a basketball player, and her future is unlimited.

Yan Weiwen

Six or seven years ago, the Qixiu Women's Basketball Team was famous on the court, and Miss Yan was already an excellent forward for the team. However, at that time, she was young, so there were fewer highlights. Later, due to the lack of activities in women's basketball, there was no opportunity to see the heroines' skills. Recently, with the revival, Miss Yan made a comeback and joined the Yuan team. Her figure has developed with age, becoming a standard center. Her skills have not faded due to prolonged inactivity, but seem more outstanding than before. The Yuan team's forwards are particularly moving, relying on Yan's center's strategy. She has a great mind for dribbling. Her accurate mid-range shooting and aesthetic appearance make her an unparalleled center talent in Shanghai's women's basketball. She always maintains a friendly attitude and a sweet smile on her face during the game, a worthy model for athletes.

### Essentials of Basketball Theory (14)

— Liang Zhao'an

(3) Feint A feint is a technique used to deceive the opponent, making it difficult to know the attacking target at once. This feinting action can be done with the hands, feet, body, eyes, mouth, etc. It can be done alone or in combination, and it can vary with the person's hearing, understanding, and experience, but it must be performed generously and purely. It is most often used when throwing a boundary ball, when facing a close defender, when dribbling with the ball while being guarded by an enemy, when shooting after dribbling, when encountering an enemy in front, or when an enemy approaches to defend after receiving the ball. In short, feints can be used at any time, but do not use the same kind often, and it must have the right timing to be effective, otherwise, it will inevitably lead to unnecessary actions.

(4) Blocking The blocking method means that a teammate who does not have the ball uses various methods that do not infringe on the opponent to block the opponent's defensive route so that the teammate with the ball can obtain an attacking opportunity. For example, after A passes the ball to B, he immediately steps forward to block the enemy guarding B, so that B can dribble forward from behind A and shoot. This method is used most often when attacking in the front court, especially when both sides are densely packed. All teams that have undergone advanced training spend a considerable amount of time receiving this technical training. Modern basketball law mostly adopts the five-person joint defense and man-to-man strategy. The former is densely deployed in the enemy's court, and the latter is always tightly guarding the opponent. To break through these two defensive strategies, it is most effective to use the blocking method with the entire team attacking. It seems that Shanghai's teams are not accustomed to using this tactic. It is common to see players running after passing the ball, not knowing to immediately block the nearest enemy so that teammates can dribble and attack. If they run away, they will unknowingly give way to the enemy to step forward and intercept the teammate's ball. This shows that they do not know how to use the blocking method, and it is necessary to conduct special research and training.

Three: Basic Techniques of Individual Defense

In modern basketball, since the center circle jump ball has disappeared, due to various new tactics, fast attack and fast defense are mostly adopted, especially fast defense. Therefore, every player must accelerate their individual offensive and defensive techniques. Modern teams that are good at both offense and defense can control others. Otherwise, they will inevitably be controlled by others. In fact, in basketball tactics, being good at defense is better than being good at offense. When two strong teams meet and have the same offensive strength, the key to winning must lie in defensive techniques. Because a good defender will have more opportunities to get the ball and attack. However, most players are brave in attacking but neglect defense. It is common to see players spending 99% of their time studying attacking methods in practice, while rarely encountering defensive techniques. This is a big mistake. If the enemy is weak and we are strong, we can rely on the advantage of attacking skills to drive straight into the enemy. If the enemy is strong and we are weak, we will not be able to overcome the attack, nor will we be able to defend the retreat. Therefore, the art of offense and defense must be focused on strict defense, followed by offense.

(1) Defensive Hints

Players who are good at defense must always occupy the dominant position in guarding the enemy. Defend the inner circle, stand in the middle of the enemy and the basket, so that both the ball and the person can be taken care of at the same time, avoiding the unfavorable situation that occurs when the enemy uses the blocking method to attack. At the same time, it can also intercept the enemy's dribble, especially in the "man-to-man" defensive method. If both the ball and the person can be guarded at the same time, the most important thing at this time is to guard the person instead of the ball. If you only look at the ball and not the person, you will inevitably be escaped by the enemy using the feint, blocking, or rotation method. Therefore, in individual defensive techniques, you must first understand the importance of the position you stand, and then you can talk about other defensive methods.

(2) Correct Defense Method

The standing posture is very important for the correct defense method. The feet should be separated left and right, the knees should be slightly bent, the body should be slightly leaning forward, the arms should be open, and one hand should be raised horizontally to block the opponent's way. One hand should be raised high in front of the enemy, constantly waving to create a fierce stance to disrupt the opponent's line of sight, make them panic and confused, and make it difficult to shoot and pass, or lose the ball in a panic so that it can be seized. However, this standing posture must always maintain the balance of the body's center of gravity without losing control. The standing position should not be too close to the enemy, as it is easy to touch the body and commit a foul. It is also difficult to observe the enemy's movements, and it is easy for the opponent to use the feint method to confuse our line of sight. Or use a low pass, half-ball pass, or use a rotation evasion method to escape around the body. But you cannot be too far away from the enemy, as it will lose the defensive effect. You should stand about one yard away from the enemy, so that you can reach the ball they are holding in their chest. The method of guarding the enemy is not easy to leave the position until the enemy rushes forward. It is not easy to jump up and grab the ball until the enemy has shot the ball. If the enemy is holding the ball and starts to rush forward, you should first retreat, determine their passing or dribbling route, and then step forward to intercept. If the enemy is not holding the ball and rushes forward, you can follow their run,抢占 the inner關. You should run and force them close to the sideline, or trap them in the corner of the field, so that the route they take is longer and the area they can move is smaller. Never let them enter the inner circle and occupy a field closer to the basket than us. This is just a general statement, and you still need to refer to other defensive methods and use them in combination to adapt to various defensive situations.

(3) Defense Method After the Opponent Shoots

After the opponent shoots, the defensive method is that each defensive player should strictly defend the enemy they are guarding and must grab the inner group near the basket before the enemy, and drive the enemy out of the關, so that the enemy cannot easily follow up and shoot again. Even if the enemy can attack again, they must pass through our players and run. It is not easy to get close to the basket and score. Therefore, when the enemy shoots, you should not stare at the route of the ball, but should monitor the enemy, watch their feet, so that you can judge their actions and prepare for defense in advance.

### Gleanings from the Sports Scene
