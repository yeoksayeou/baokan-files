### Japanese Army and Navy Forces Meet - Enemy in Manila Surrounded - Fierce Fighting Continues on Both Banks of the Pasig River

Luzon Front, 21st (Central News Agency Dispatch) - Under enemy artillery fire, the Japanese garrison in Manila launched a counterattack on the enemy's flank on the 18th, and joined forces with newly-arrived elite Japanese army units advancing from the northeast, east of Manila. The enemy forces concentrated in the lower eastern part of Manila are now surrounded by the Japanese army. The Japanese army's counteroffensive around Manila is intensifying. The Japanese army and naval forces defending Manila are fighting fiercely for strongholds inside and outside the city, engaging in repeated hand-to-hand combat, especially around the Central Post Office in the old city and near the University of the Philippines. On the evening of the 18th, they killed or wounded over fifty enemy soldiers near the racecourse. The enemy forces that have infiltrated Manila are either holding onto surviving buildings or constructing earthwork defenses to guard against Japanese attacks. Simultaneously, the elite Japanese units that attacked the enemy's flank from the northeast of Manila stormed into Quezon City Airport northeast of Manila on the night of the 19th, penetrated the enemy's center, and suppressed them. In addition, another unit advancing west towards Meycauayan, 15 kilometers north of Manila, attacked over 250 enemy soldiers carrying five armored vehicles in the Bulacan area northeast of the city on the evening of the 18th, capturing a large amount of supplies and inflicting a crushing defeat on the enemy, achieving a major victory. Another elite regiment advancing from the south ravaged enemy tank groups and artillery positions, dodging enemy air raids and breaking through the enemy's rear lines. By the end of the 18th, they had joined forces with the Japanese naval units in Makati, resulting in a situation where the enemy forces were being encircled from the east and north by Japanese forces advancing from the northwest of Manila.

Lisbon, 20th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - Fighting continues to be fierce both inside and outside Manila. Japanese forces are tenaciously defending their strongholds, especially in the old city of Intramuros on the south bank of the Pasig River, holding onto the ancient Spanish fortresses, preventing the enemy from approaching. Fierce fighting is continuing. Because many residents who were unable to evacuate remain in the city, the Japanese army is also protecting them during operations. According to a United Press dispatch on the 20th, the enemy commander in charge of attacking Intramuros, Major General Griswold, will launch a scorched-earth attack on the Intramuros area. He reportedly stated that because the U.S. military had lost many soldiers in Manila, he had decided to launch a destructive attack. Intramuros contains Spanish-era Catholic churches, which are used as shelters by residents. The fact that the U.S. military is now launching a destructive attack on it because of excessive troop losses is an inhumane act that is truly infuriating.

### Bloody Battle for Corregidor Island - Japanese Forces Sink Enemy Warships

Luzon Front, 21st (Central News Agency Dispatch) - The Japanese garrison in Manila, showing no weakness, is still fighting fiercely with the enemy. Other elite units in various parts of Luzon are echoing this effort, fiercely sweeping away the enemy forces. Currently, off Lingayen Gulf, hundreds of enemy ships and many warships are attempting to reinforce ground troops, operating between the shores of Lingayen Gulf and various locations. Active road construction is underway. Since the 15th, Japanese forces in the area have inflicted heavy casualties on the enemy north of San Jose. Although the enemy forces on Corregidor Island have suffered significant damage, they continue to send reinforcements. On the 18th, they landed paratroopers, who hid in dense forests and rocky shores, launching attacks from time to time. Although the circumference of the small island in the bay is only five kilometers, the two armies are engaged in a fierce, bloody battle for control of this island. The elite Japanese army and naval forces stationed on the island have repeatedly used accurate fire and unique hand-to-hand combat tactics to kill countless enemy soldiers. One army unit, under the cover of darkness, sank one enemy battleship and one transport ship.

### Japanese Air Force Sinks Enemy Submarine

A Certain Japanese Base in the South Pacific, 21st (Central News Agency Dispatch) - Japanese air units discovered an enemy submarine in the southwestern Pacific on the 20th, launched a fierce attack, and sank it.

### Luzon Island - Japanese Military Strategy

A Military Expert Speaks

Nanjing, 21st (Central News Agency Dispatch) - Foreign news today: Japanese forces in Manila have launched an offensive and made steady progress, having joined forces east of the city, causing the American forces that invaded the city to face enemies on all sides and become encircled. This reporter recently interviewed a military expert, asking about the Japanese strategy on Luzon Island. He replied as follows: Since the enemy forces landed in the Lingayen Gulf area of Luzon, their main focus of attack has been Manila. The Americans believe that Manila is the political center of the Philippines, and capturing Manila has great political significance. In other words, capturing Manila means occupying the entire Philippines. However, from a military perspective, Manila is only one city in the Philippines. The Japanese army only stationed a small force in Manila, resisting the invading American forces in the streets of Manila, while the majority of the army retreated to the northern mountainous areas, luring the enemy deep and launching a flanking attrition strategy, inflicting serious damage on the enemy. After the American forces landed in Lingayen Gulf, they should have launched a frontal attack strategically. However, because the Japanese army held the mountainous areas on the flanks and launched constant attacks, the American forces were constrained and had to rely on the flanks, making it impossible to develop a frontal attack. It was not until today that they were able to invade part of Manila with two divisions. The five divisions of troops near Lingayen Gulf were attacked on the flanks by the Japanese army, putting them in a dilemma. At this time, inflicting a fatal blow is a strategic success for the Japanese army. As a result, the British army re-landed on both sides of the Subic Bay Peninsula in an attempt to recover from their strategic failure. On February 14th, the Japanese garrison on Luzon Island launched a large-scale political attack on the landing American forces. Currently, there are twelve or thirteen divisions of enemy landing forces on Luzon Island, while the Japanese garrison, with the determination to win, is fighting bravely to annihilate the enemy, inflicting damage on the enemy from the flanks.

### Japanese Forces on Iwo Jima Fiercely Attack and Destroy 100 Enemy Tanks - Nimitz Acknowledges Increasing Damage

Tokyo, 21st (Central News Agency Dispatch) - Japanese garrison forces in the eastern part of Iwo Jima, using the mountainous terrain and fortified positions, fiercely attacked the enemy forces. Around 11 PM on the 20th, they daringly counterattacked the enemy forces at the southern pier and in the southern settlements, inflicting heavy casualties and repelling them. In other areas, the enemy forces approached to within 200 to 300 feet of the main Japanese positions, but suffered heavy losses due to Japanese attacks, and their offensive has stalled, with no active movements.

Tokyo, 21st (Central News Agency Dispatch) - By 10 AM on the 20th, the Japanese garrison forces on Iwo Jima had destroyed over 100 of the 300 enemy landing tanks. Over 20 of these were the result of the efforts of a Japanese lieutenant, who dared to engage the enemy with rapid-fire cannons when the enemy began landing in the southern part of the island on the 19th, focusing his fire on the enemy tanks, resulting in the destruction of over 20 of them. After achieving outstanding achievements, the lieutenant bravely died in the first line of defense on the morning of the 20th.

Lisbon, 21st (Central News Agency Dispatch) - According to a Reuters dispatch from Washington, Nimitz announced on the night of the 20th that the damage to U.S. Navy personnel on Iwo Jima was gradually increasing, stating: "During the landing, the damage to the allied forces was slight, but as the Japanese forces emerged from caves and launched fierce attacks with artillery and mortars, the damage to the allied forces gradually increased." An Associated Press dispatch also stated: "The Japanese artillery fire from hundreds of caves on the slopes near the landing sites is extremely fierce. Although the exact casualties of the American forces are not clear, they are predicted to be considerable."

Lisbon, 21st (Central News Agency Dispatch) - According to a dispatch from Washington, 30,000 U.S. naval personnel, transported on 800 ships, landed on Iwo Jima and are attempting to build and expand coastal fortifications. The Japanese forces on the island are bravely resisting, and the intensity of the fighting is far greater than on Tarawa and Peleliu. An Associated Press frontline correspondent reported that U.S. casualties are heavy and that this landing operation is more difficult than past operations, and that the battle will take a long time and involve a lot of losses. Another dispatch stated that the U.S. First Amphibious Group fired 8,000 rockets at the coastline before landing, and the entire island was shrouded in smoke and shrapnel. According to another dispatch, the U.S. military's primary objective seems to be the airbase on Mount Suribachi.

### Enemy Planes Attack Nanjing - One Shot Down

Nanjing, 21st (Central News Agency Dispatch) - Three U.S. Air Force P-51 fighters stationed in Chongqing intruded into the airspace over Nanjing from the west on the morning of the 21st, strafing the Yangtze River area with machine guns before fleeing. However, they were fiercely attacked by ground air defense forces, and one enemy plane was shot down near Jiangxin Island in the capital. In the afternoon, an enemy P-38 plane circled in the airspace before fleeing north after a while. There was no damage on our side.

Editorial

### The Connection Between Price Control and Materials Management

Price controls must be implemented in conjunction with materials management in order to be effective. This is a self-evident principle. If prices are simply controlled without effective methods for managing materials, then the controlled prices are bound to become mere words, and no one will be willing to abide by them. Moreover, unscrupulous officials can use them as a tool for extortion. Even with strict laws and severe punishments rigorously enforced, merchants, who value profit above all else, will certainly find ways to hide materials in anticipation of better prices. Ultimately, there will be no goods for sale in the stores, and consumers will have difficulty making purchases. Therefore, price controls must be accompanied by materials management. This is absolutely essential.

For the sake of stabilizing people's livelihoods, the economic authorities have long established agencies to control prices. However, historically, controlled prices have remained separate from black market prices, with no connection between the two. Controlled prices have even risen in step with black market prices, rendering them meaningless. The authorities have long recognized this, and there have been repeated discussions about the need to manage materials before controlling prices. However, because the authority to manage materials is insufficient and the methods are difficult to make comprehensive, the discussions have been contentious and have not yet been put into practice.

Some argue that the past failure of price controls to take effect was due to a lack of strict enforcement. If strictly enforced, it would certainly be possible to achieve considerable results. However, this argument is not entirely correct. Generally, when a new price control system is implemented, merchants are required to sell the goods displayed in their stores at controlled prices. This is a form of materials management for the goods displayed in the stores, so it is possible to temporarily achieve the effect of controlled prices for the goods displayed in the stores. However, the quantity of these goods is extremely limited, and once the stores run out of goods, the controlled prices will no longer be effective, making it difficult to sustain them.

We believe that materials management must involve managing all or most of the same type of materials stored in the private sector in order to achieve its objectives. Agricultural products are scattered in the vast countryside, making them difficult to manage until they are concentrated. Therefore, the methods for controlling agricultural products must first support the existing institutions for collection and promote centralized distribution, making it easier to manage. However, the current control methods are to destroy existing institutions, block existing distribution channels, and rely solely on control agencies to assign new personnel to monopolize purchases. This is truly useless and harmful, doing twice the work for half the result. As for the production of manufactured goods, it is concentrated in cities, making it easier to manage. The example of past cloth purchases can illustrate this. However, those who were purchased from felt hardship. If there is now an order to register certain materials, merchants will suspect that they are about to be purchased again, and they will inevitably try to escape and take shortcuts, creating more obstacles. If, at the time of registration, it is stated that it is only for management and that there will be no purchases, and that the sale of managed goods will be priced favorably to ensure that those being managed are not harmed and can even obtain profits, then the resistance to management will naturally be reduced, and it can proceed smoothly.

When discussing materials management methods, most people focus on hoarding by non-industry people, believing that they should be forced to sell to industry people. However, the current big hoarders have already put up the signs of industry people. Therefore, in addition to cracking down on hoarding by non-industry people, the method of managing materials must also specify the total amount of materials originally owned by wholesalers and purchased from non-industry people, the amount that should be retained each period, the amount to be allocated to retailers, and how to price them; the total amount of materials originally owned by retailers and purchased from wholesalers, the amount that should be retained each period, the amount to be allocated to consumers, and how to price them, one by one in detail. Efforts should also be made to prevent retailers from reducing allocations and diverting goods to the black market. If this can be done, the purpose of materials management will naturally be easily achieved, and price controls will also be effective. This proves the necessity of the connection between managing materials and controlling prices.

### Chongqing Fears Major Japanese Offensive

Lisbon, 21st (Central News Agency Dispatch) - According to news from Chongqing, He Yingqin stated at the graduation ceremony of the third class of the Standardization Military Academy in Kunming on the 19th that the Japanese army, in addition to the Kwantung Army in Manchuria, also has a large number of troops stationed in mainland China. These troops are deployed to defend against American landings on the Chinese coast. The establishment of a new General Headquarters in Kunming by the Chongqing army is also to prepare for a major Japanese offensive.

The Trend of Decisive Battles on the Mainland is Increasingly Tight

Guangzhou, 21st (Central News Agency Dispatch) - Judging from the joint operations of the U.S. Army, the Chongqing Army, and the U.S. Air Force stationed in Chongqing, the trend of decisive battles on the mainland is becoming increasingly urgent. In particular, the general counter-offensive situation in the southwest by the American ground forces and the 90th Division of the Chongqing Army should be guarded against. Since June of last year, the U.S. Army has gradually moved into the mainland. In late June, it had placed a mechanized detachment of scientific weapons on standby in Chongqing. Subsequently, a full regiment of heavy artillery, mainly consisting of 105mm and 75mm howitzers, a tank regiment, an anti-tank artillery unit, and large numbers of imported parachute troops were successively concentrated near Kunming, with an estimated total strength of over 30,000. The logistics units are deployed on the southwestern front, and some have advanced to Xi'an, reportedly attempting to attack the North China front. Some of the American-equipped Chongqing Army's expeditionary force in Burma and the Chongqing Army in India have been concentrated around Kunming.

### Ishiwata Appointed State Minister and Chief Cabinet Secretary - Tsushima Juichi Appointed Minister of Finance

Tokyo, 21st (Central News Agency Dispatch) - Due to the resignation of Chief Cabinet Secretary Hirose, the Japanese government has decided to make some personnel changes. First, Minister of Finance Ishiwata was appointed State Minister and Chief Cabinet Secretary. The subsequent Minister of Finance has been determined to be President Tsushima Juichi. Prime Minister Koiso presented this to the Emperor at 5:30 PM on the 21st, and the imperial appointment ceremony was held in the palace at 7:30 PM.

### Stilwell Road - Weak Transportation Capacity

Guangdong, 21st (Central News Agency Dispatch) - The Chongqing government regards the opening of the Stilwell Road as the lifeline of the war of resistance and has promoted it extensively. After the fall of Shaoguan, the Jian Guo Daily published in Xinyi County in southwestern Guangdong and the Zhongshan Daily both published lengthy articles by a Central News Agency correspondent stationed in Myitkyina, giving a realistic report on the Stilwell Road and listing pessimistic views, which are noteworthy. The main points are as follows: According to their views, even after this road is opened, the Chongqing government will only be able to maintain the war of resistance and will still not be able to carry out a counter-offensive. The reasons are: (1) In the past, the Burma Road was only able to transport 20,000 to 30,000 tons per month. Moreover, this Stilwell Road is 1,800 kilometers long, and its transportation will inevitably be difficult. (2) The number of heavy-duty trucks in India is very small. (3) The opening of the new road is of no benefit to the people, especially since the United States stated before the opening that the China-India highway was only for military use and was not built for the benefit of the Chinese people. This statement has hurt the feelings of the people in Chongqing.

Central News Agency, Shanghai Dispatch - Recent Chongqing newspapers have often promoted that the Stilwell Road has been opened, considering this to be the only success of Chongqing in 1944, and calling for American aid to Chongqing to be transported on a regular basis. However, the issue is the transportation capacity of trucks and various facilities on the road. What results will this cause for Chongqing? Let us try to examine it. Since Chongqing began promoting the opening of the Stilwell Road, it has also frequently advertised the establishment of hospitals, etc., to prove the fact that the road has been opened. However, according to Brigadier General Burton, "The transportation on the Ledo Road is limited because it relies on China's own efforts and cannot be fully utilized." This also exposes the function of the Ledo Road.

Reliance on the Enemy America is Clearly a Mistake

The strategic situation established by the Japanese army's current north-south operation on the mainland allows it to launch offensives against Kunming, the terminus of the road, and Guiyang and Xi'an, the gateways to Chongqing, at any time. If necessary, it can immediately cut off its heart and block its supplies. At that time, all that will remain for them is air transport between India and Chengdu, and the narrow passage of the Northwest Highway, which is obstructed by the steep Himalayas, as well as the supply route between Calcutta, India, and Chengdu. However, the above routes are affected by the weather, and due to the attacks of B-29 aircraft, each route has a major supply task. If 100 B-29 aircraft are deployed for attacks all day, they will require 66,000 gallons of fuel, and 300 transport aircraft will be needed to transport the fuel. Even if 20,000 tons are transported each month, it will not be enough. The fuel distribution is 90% to the U.S. military in Chongqing and 10% to the Chongqing army. The dissatisfaction in Chongqing cannot be changed. After the U.S. military arrives on the mainland, the greater the supplies, the more the amount of transportation to Chongqing will be reduced. The Americanization of the Chongqing army also indicates the lack of human resources in the U.S. military in Chongqing. The United States is now relying on its own material strength to fight in the Pacific. However, it is clearly contradictory that they are calling for a counter-offensive against Japan on the mainland, using Chongqing's manpower. In the decisive battle on the mainland, the United States is adopting the vicious method of using its own weapons and the strength of the Chongqing army against the powerful Japan. Chongqing is still yearning for aid, but the result will only be the survival of the fittest.

### An Examination of the Sixth District of Nanhui

— Yifei

On the dawn of January 29th, as the east began to take on the shape of a white fish, I rose, braving the cold wind, and boarded a rickshaw that I had booked the day before, embarking once more on my journey. This time, my destination was Zhaolou, under the jurisdiction of Nanhui. As I wanted to visit factories along the way, I took a roundabout route. Apart from the main road, much of the journey was on narrow, winding paths, where pedestrians were scarce, save for the occasional three or five peasant women carrying firewood to the town to seek a good price. Bored on the rickshaw, I chatted with the driver. He claimed to be from Haimen and was originally a farmer. However, due to the excessive taxes and levies in the countryside, farming was no longer profitable. Therefore, he had left his village and fields a year ago to make a living as a rickshaw puller in Pudong. He said that in the best of times (rainy days), he could earn nearly 10,000 yuan a day, averaging around 6,000 yuan a day. But now, due to too many competitors, sometimes he would go two or three days without a customer. After about forty-five minutes, we arrived at Hesha Town.

Visiting Factories

After about forty-five minutes, we arrived at Hesha Town (also known as Xiashen). Asking the locals, I found the location of the well-known Great China Kiln. The kiln was quite large in scale, and the factory site was also very spacious. Although it could not compare with the Longtan Cement Factory, it was still impressive to see such a prominent factory in a small, remote town like Xiashen. According to the owner, Shao Qimin, the factory currently employs about 400 workers, and the tiles and bricks produced are divided into two types: machine-made and traditional. The former had been promoted overseas before the war and was very popular; the latter, in addition to being sold in the county, was also mainly sold in Shanghai. Therefore, the kiln had a branch office on Niuzhuang Road in Shanghai, managing exports and local sales. However, after the outbreak of the war, sales stagnated. To ensure the livelihoods of the workers who had served for many years, they now also manufacture flour to make up for the losses, with somewhat satisfactory results, he claimed.

The reporter left Xiashen and headed to Hangtou Town, which was about three miles away. The town faces the Zhangang River, leading west to the Huangpu River and east to Xinchang. It is the only waterway for transportation in the southern part of Nanhui County. Previously, there were steamers directly to Shanghai, but they have now been discontinued. The port has inter-day passenger transport to Shanghai and Minhang, and behind it is the Zhounan Highway, so transportation is still relatively convenient. The lime kiln is the only one in the Nanhui County area. The kiln has more than thirty workers. Its raw materials are coke and blue stone, which are burned and refined. The lime used for all construction in the county is supplied by this kiln. According to the kiln owner, Zhang Qinbo, the factory's turnover is more than ten million yuan a year, because the current market price of lime has soared to nearly 2,000 yuan per dan (a unit of weight), which is a world away from the pre-war price of six jiao (a unit of currency) per dan.

An Overview of Zhaolou

From Hangtou, we turned towards Zhaolou, which was quite a distance away. We arrived after noon.

Zhaolou is the leading town in the sixth district of Nanhui County. Commerce is not very prosperous, but there are many gentry families in the area. The district borders Fengxian to the south, the Pujiang River to the west, Zhoupu, a commercial hub of Nanhui, to the north, and Xinchang, the seventh district, to the east. The entire district is divided into twelve townships, with a population of 60,000, and commerce is quite depressed. The only financial institutions in the area are several small pawnshops. Prices are lower than in other districts. Most of the residents are farmers, mostly small farmers, and mostly part-time farmers. There are few self-sufficient farmers, tenant farmers, and very few landlords. The main agricultural products are rice and wheat, followed by coarse grains and vegetables. Farmers near the Mingang River all engage in the sideline of making rush bags, which are of excellent quality and are popular with farmers elsewhere.

Developed Education

Education is quite developed throughout the district. There are five complete primary schools and more than twenty junior primary schools, with 3,000 students. The salaries of the teachers are the highest in Nanhui, as the local township offices provide each teacher with five to six dou (a unit of volume) of white rice per month. Therefore, the teachers are also of better quality than in other places and can devote themselves to their work with peace of mind. Public security is relatively peaceful. In fact, there are no armed forces stationed to maintain order, the inside story of which is worth pondering, and the details are not something that a casual visitor like myself can understand.

The So-Called Du Rice

Duheng is a small town in the far west of Nanhui County, near the Pujiang River. While resting in a teahouse, I met an old farmer and chatted with him about the rice market in Duheng half a year ago. He described the bustling scene at that time, no less than that of Zhoujiaqiao and Xujiahui near Shanghai today. Although it is a thing of the past, it can still serve as a reference for those who care about the people's food.

Duheng is not a rice-producing area in Nanhui. Apart from its own needs, most of the residents are rice merchants, supplying food to Shanghai. The phrase "Du Rice Required?" has become synonymous with the people of Pudong. However, because the area produces very little rice, it relies entirely on transportation from Songjiang, Jinshan, and other places, and then resells it to Shanghai. Because the situation of rice control in Shanghai was tense, the rice merchants in Duheng, except for large merchants who could spend a sum of money to get through the blockade, all risked great danger, racked their brains, and tried to transport rice to Shanghai. After deducting the necessary expenses along the way, the profit was still considerable, but it was by no means an easy task.

### The Soviet Army on the Eastern Front Launches a New Offensive. Fierce Fighting in the Guben Highway Area.

Berlin, 21st (Central News Agency) Hais News Agency: A German military spokesman said: Currently, the focus of the Soviet offensive is between Bobr and Kwisa, extending north to the city of Guben and south to the city of Lauban, where fierce fighting is currently taking place. Soviet attacks on the cities of Lauban and Görlitz have been repulsed, and Rotwasser has been recaptured by German forces. Marshal Konev's troops have crossed the railway between Sorau and Görlitz, an area of forty-five kilometers wide. Soviet troops have also been blocked between Krossen and the city of Guben.

Berlin, 21st (Central News Agency) Hais News Agency: The Soviet army on the Eastern Front has launched a new offensive. The fighting in the area north of the Western Beskids has eased slightly. The German army has achieved considerable success in resisting over the past 24 hours. The Soviet army, led by General Konev, has expanded its offensive beyond the bend of the Woter River, reaching the line between Krossen and Lauban. The Soviet general seems to be trying to push his troops closer to the Guben Highway area before the main battle. There is fierce fighting along the Sorau-Görlitz railway, with the German army resisting strongly and counterattacking from time to time. The enemy's progress is minimal. North of Küstrin, the Soviet army is only launching localized offensives. The Soviet army in West Prussia continues to advance northwest towards Tuchel and Graudenz, seemingly aiming to cut off Pomerania, but has not yet broken through the German lines. The enemy is also aware that the German forces in North Pomerania, West Prussia, and East Prussia are very strong, which poses a considerable danger to the Soviet rear. Therefore, regardless of losses, they are mobilizing large forces in the hope of wiping out the German forces. The Soviet army's attempt to advance on Königsberg from Samland has been repulsed.

Stockholm, 21st (Central News Agency) German News Agency: London News: British Foreign Secretary Eden met with Gu Weijun, the Chongqing Ambassador to Britain, yesterday and formally informed him of the results of the anti-Axis meeting in Yalta. Eden also met with former Polish Prime Minister Mikołajczyk, former Polish Foreign Minister Romer, and the French and American ambassadors. Eden is currently paying particular attention to two issues: one is the Polish issue, and the other is France's reaction to the Crimean Conference. According to well-informed sources in London, Eden may travel to Paris in the near future.

British Newspaper Commentary

Berlin, 21st (Central News Agency) German News Agency: A German government spokesman declared: The British newspapers' discussion of the principle of neutrality is related to the future San Francisco Conference. Since several small countries in Central and South America declared war on Germany, the three major anti-Axis powers have believed that their sudden entry into the war is only to gain a seat at the conference and share the spoils. The British newspapers strongly oppose this, arguing that only large countries can participate. Turkey may be allowed to attend, but Spain must not participate.

### The French Foreign Minister Reports on the Progress of the Three-Headed Conference.

Geneva, 21st (Central News Agency) Hais News Agency, Paris dispatch: French Foreign Minister Bidault reported to the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Consultative Assembly yesterday on the results of the Yalta Conference and the French government's attitude towards the various issues discussed at the conference.

Gogol Refuses to Meet Roosevelt and Explains Reasons

Lisbon, 21st (Central News Agency) According to a dispatch from Paris: Gogol explained last night the reasons for his refusal to meet Roosevelt, the main points of which are as follows: The American ambassador to Paris had notified the government on Roosevelt's instructions that Roosevelt was unable to visit Paris and had arranged to meet in Algiers. However, Mr. Gogol was unable to leave Paris due to busy political affairs. Moreover, France had not participated in the foundation of the Crimean Conference and could not understand its content, which would detract from the significance of the meeting. Gogol repeatedly stated that he hoped to meet with Roosevelt in Paris.

Lisbon, 21st (Central News Agency) Hais News Agency: The White House issued a communiqué yesterday stating: Roosevelt was disappointed that Mr. Gogol was unable to leave France due to public affairs to meet with him in Algiers. It is reported that Roosevelt's invitation to Gogol was delivered to Paris by the American ambassador six days before his arrival in Algiers. Roosevelt also expressed his deep hope to resolve various issues related to the interests of both the United States and France.

Before heading back to the United States, Mr. Roosevelt also met with Prime Minister Churchill in Alexandria. American Secretary of State Stettinius also went to that place to report to Mr. Roosevelt on his meeting with Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov in Moscow. American Ambassador to the United Kingdom Winant also flew from Britain to Alexandria to meet with Mr. Roosevelt. On his way home, Mr. Roosevelt finally went to Algiers to meet with the American Ambassador to France, Caffery, and the American Ambassador to Italy, Kirk.

Lisbon, 21st (Central News Agency) According to a dispatch from Washington, Roosevelt planned to meet with the Turkish side in Egypt after the Crimean Conference, but this was rejected by the Turkish side.

Japanese Army's Air Defense Troops in the Philippines are Full of Fighting Spirit

### The New Stage of the Burma Campaign

The enemy's all-out counteroffensive against Japan has already begun. Observe the Allied forces in Burma, echoing the US Army's landing operations on Luzon Island, now appearing with a new and intense posture. The British East Indies Fleet has been relentlessly attacking Japanese air units stationed in Burma day after day. Although British ships have suffered great losses, they are still sailing towards areas like Myeik, Ramree, and Kyaukpyu, providing cover for the British landing in Arakan. Simultaneously, British-Indian troops advancing directly into Burma from the northern part of the Burma-India border, along with the US-Chinese Allied forces, are engaging in increasingly fierce warfare.

Yunnan-Vietnam War Zone

Chen Cheng, the Minister of the Military Affairs Department of Chongqing, has established the Chongqing General Headquarters in Kunming. He has also reorganized and strengthened the Yunnan Expeditionary Force and the Fourth War Zone facing Annam in the Yunnan-Vietnam theater. All of this is in preparation for countering the Japanese army's new offensive operations on the mainland. At the same time, this also proves that the war clouds of a counteroffensive against Japan are gradually thickening on the Chinese mainland and in Southeast Asia. Therefore, the entire Asia, without distinction, has already entered the final stage of the war.

The enemy's current war aims to sever the transportation and communication between the Japanese mainland and various parts of the South Seas, depriving Japan of military supplies and raw materials, thereby stifling Japan's war effort. It also aims to open up the Ledo Road and the Burma Road to strengthen the US-Chinese Allied forces on the Chinese mainland. Furthermore, it aims to use the British counteroffensive in Southeast Asia to restrain Japanese war power.

Discord Among Generals

Lieutenant General Raymond A. Wheeler, the Deputy Supreme Allied Commander of Southeast Asia, holding this intention, proposed to his subordinate John G. Hefty that the British army should carry out a general land and sea counteroffensive in Southeast Asia. However, due to the adverse situation in India, it was difficult to comply, and thus the two sides had conflicting opinions. However, thanks to the mediation of Lord Mountbatten, who was recuperating, the British-Indian army was able to carry out a landing operation on the scale seen in Arakan today.

However, this passive intention of the British does not mean that the changes in the Philippine campaign will not alter the small-scale nature of the Southeast Asia landing operation. In truth, if the Pacific campaign becomes more intense, the decisive battle in Southeast Asia will immediately commence.

Sino-Burmese Border

In addition, Chiang Kai-shek dispatched the 5th Division, directly under the central government, to the Sino-Burmese border, and the Yunnan Expeditionary Force also moved to Kunming. The Japanese troops stationed on the Sino-Burmese border took advantage of this to launch a fierce attack on the main force of the 116th Division west of Wanting on the Longchuan River, inflicting a major defeat on the enemy on the south bank. Currently, the enemy is fleeing in disarray, while the Japanese army is in hot pursuit.

The land and sea battle lines in Southeast Asia are, as mentioned above, intensifying. At the same time, the Japanese army will launch a large-scale war to annihilate the enemy. (Translated by Lin from the January 26th Mainichi Shimbun's Burma correspondence)

A Visit to the Western Front in Europe

With the Eastern Front extremely strained, the European war has finally entered its final stage. Currently, all the German people are paying close attention to any developments on the Eastern Front and are concentrating all their efforts on dealing with the fierce Soviet offensive. The reason why Germany can concentrate on resisting the Soviet offensive and why the people are not panicking is entirely due to Rundstedt's counteroffensive last fall, which made the Western Front as solid as a fortress. The German military high command, in order to avoid fighting on two fronts, launched a preemptive offensive on the Western Front. This was a winter offensive intended to respond to the Soviet precedent. The reporter (Special Correspondent Shan Yu) was granted permission by the German authorities to visit the Cologne and Aachen war zones after Rundstedt's offensive on the Western Front for a week.

When the American army launched a fierce offensive on the Aachen and Düren lines, everyone thought that the German military organization would collapse from here. This shows how serious the war was at the time. Therefore, the old and young all fled, and the remaining men, needless to say, even the women were armed to defend against the enemy or served in the military. All the able-bodied men formed national assault teams, distributed bullets, and were sent to the front lines as cannon fodder. Later, because Rundstedt's offensive was effective, the Aachen area returned to stability, and the atmosphere there is gradually filled with the scene of people living and working in peace. Residents who had fled to other places one after another returned to their homes.

On the Banks of the Rhine

However, eighteen districts in this large Nazi party area, and six districts in the area of contention, are still entirely or partially held by the British and American armies. The current front line has already approached the area thirty or forty miles west of Cologne, where the main headquarters is located. Therefore, when the wind is favorable, one often constantly hears the rumbling of artillery fire. In the military reception center there, hearing the hurried footsteps of the soldiers makes one truly feel the scene of the front lines. The various cities on the banks of the Rhine, formerly known for their beauty and elegance, are now ruins in the snow-covered rubble.

The various cities, reduced to a scorched earth scene too ghastly to look at, are still heavily bombed by enemy planes day and night. Air raid alarms and all-clear signals often alternate with each other. The transportation network is completely destroyed, and the people are alarmed. Trains only carry out transport tasks during the brief moments when enemy planes have left. City streetcars and suburban trams have completely stopped running, and the residents' means of transportation, apart from relying on military bicycles, are forced to walk.

On the streets and alleys of various cities, crowded citizens wait in the biting cold for the arrival of military vehicles. The reporter also ran around everywhere to grab a vehicle.

Common Hatred for the Enemy

Because of scheduled manufacturing, the transportation network in western Germany has been completely destroyed to an extent far beyond the reporter's imagination. However, that Germany was able to complete preparations for the Western Front offensive under these harsh conditions shows the strength of German organization. At the same time, in such an environment, local residents still go to work as usual every day, from which one can see the strength of the German people.

They often walk one or two hours to get to the factory. But the people of western Germany have not yet suffered the pain of hunger and cold. In their hearts, there is only a boiling hatred for the British and Americans. From the cadres of the Nazi Party and the generals to the shopkeepers, whenever they mention the British and Americans, they are always filled with anger and resentment.

On a very clear day, the reporter was walking somewhere, looking up at the sky, and saw planes flying high in the sky like dragons, dragging long black smoke tails. All the citizens stood in the center of the street looking up at the swishing sound, just like the sound of common hatred for the enemy emanating from the heartstrings of the people.

Calm Hearts

While in a car from Cologne to Heen, the reporter was stopped by a young woman who squeezed into the car, saying that she was going to the barracks to see her fiancé. In the car, the young woman talked and laughed with the soldiers. As soon as they entered the protected city streets, the alarming air raid sirens sounded loudly. The young woman retorted that the enemy planes would definitely not visit this place, so it would be best to have dinner here first. Therefore, many soldiers stayed in the car and had dinner here first. Therefore, many soldiers stayed in the car, and everyone was not alarmed.

Those who spoke with the reporter all said that although the people of western Germany have suffered such a tragic situation, they have not lost their confidence and are stubbornly resisting. They are simply national heroes in the German people's war of resistance.

Saving the Nation Through Production

Bonn, a city famous for its university, is almost nine-tenths empty, and five or six tenths of all buildings have been completely destroyed by artillery fire. Of the city's population of 100,000, the authorities evacuated only 7,000 old and young people. The citizens can no longer talk about living rooms, let alone bathrooms. Everyone squats in incomplete and broken rooms.

Although most of them can breathe fresh air and bask in the sun for six days a week, most of those who work in underground factories and offices simply cannot see the light of day except on Sundays. Even on Sundays, the so-called day of rest, they must undergo military training as members of the national assault team from eight o'clock in the morning to two or three o'clock in the afternoon. In addition, they must go to the suburbs to busy themselves with building defensive facilities.

One member of the assault team is an old soldier who participated in the First World War. His two sons are fighting on the eastern Italian battlefield. He does not want to lag behind his two sons and is exerting the greatest labor enthusiasm to serve the country. Because he is over the conscription age of sixty-five, he can only voluntarily join the national assault team.

The area had demanded to secede from the Greater German Empire during the First World War, but now it is covered in dazzling white snow. Looking at the slowly flowing Rhine River, the reporter could not help but feel infinite emotion and remembered in his heart the words of the Führer Hitler's New Year's message: "The German people will be reborn from this." (Translated by Fang from the January 30th Yomiuri Hochi German correspondence)

### Fierce Battle for Saarbrücken; Street Fighting in Geilenkirchen on the Northern Route

Berlin, 21st (Central News Agency telegram) – Reuter reports: The Canadian army, advancing on Monday in the lower reaches of the Meuse and Rhine rivers, has still not achieved its objectives and has only penetrated Geilenkirchen, where street fighting is currently taking place.

### Police Authorities Determined to Cooperate in Enforcing New Price Limits; Hope Merchants in All Industries Will Strictly Exercise Self-Discipline

The Municipal Police Bureau has decided to cooperate in strengthening the enforcement of the new price limits for major commodities as determined by economic assessment. It issued a special statement yesterday, hoping that merchants in all industries and citizens will strictly exercise self-discipline in purchasing. The statement is recorded below:

"Yesterday, the Economic Bureau announced that the Shanghai Municipal Price Assessment Committee has decided on the official prices for 11 items out of 16 major commodities in accordance with the Emergency Measures Ordinance on Prices. The observance of these official prices will have a profound impact on future price control measures and the stability of people's livelihoods. In the past, although the general public suffered from high prices, they often followed the illegal prices of unscrupulous merchants because of insufficient knowledge of prices, cleverly buying and hoarding for profit. Based on the purpose of the Emergency Measures Ordinance on Prices, this Police Bureau will mobilize the total strength of the economic police, with the cooperation of the Gendarmerie, to strengthen enforcement of the official prices announced this time, which are the agreed prices for the commodities. All businesses should strictly adhere to the official agreed prices by attaching clear labels to major commodities. The general public should also be familiar with the official prices of the 11 items, including cooking oil, soap, tap water, candles, paper, cotton, cotton products, pork, beef, coal balls, and calcium drugs, in order to cooperate in preventing merchants from illegal sales. (Regarding the official prices of foreign medicines, the New Drug Association and the trade association jointly submitted a request to the Municipal Economic Bureau on November 1 last year, calculating them based on raw material prices. However, because there are too many items to announce, price lists were used to instruct each store.) Violating the official agreed prices is a crime not only for the distributors but also for the purchasers. Therefore, based on the above views, this Police Bureau will impose penalties on merchants and purchasers who disregard the official prices in the future. We hope that the general public will understand the intentions of the authorities and strictly exercise self-discipline."

### Low-Priced Rice Committee Discusses Rice Distribution Methods

The Municipal Government organized a temporary Rice Purchasing Committee to handle the purchase of low-priced rice. Currently, the first batch of 30,000 stones of rice has arrived in Shanghai, and the rice payments are being paid one after another. In order to handle the inspection, receipt, and distribution work, a separate Low-Priced Rice Committee has been formed to be specifically responsible for the task. The members of the committee will be representatives from six units: charitable organizations, cultural circles, education circles, industrial circles, business circles, and banking circles. In addition, one person will be appointed by the Municipal Government to participate and serve as the chairman of the committee. The committee held a meeting yesterday afternoon at the Kang Le Hotel to discuss the matter. In addition to the representatives of each unit, Rice Purchasing Committee members Li Sihao and Chen Binhe also attended the meeting. The following resolutions were made:

(1) The "Measures for Issuing Low-Priced Rice" were determined, consisting of four points:

1. Each of the six units (education circles, industrial circles, business circles, news and cultural circles, banking circles, and public welfare and charitable organizations) should send a representative and the Municipal Government should send a staff member to form the Low-Priced Rice Committee to jointly manage matters related to the receipt and distribution of low-priced rice in the warehouse with the responsible person of the Rice Control Committee.

2. Each unit among the six units should send a list of rice payments to its assigned representative.

3. Each household (industrial and commercial households take each trade association as one household) should obtain a rice voucher from the Fuxing Bank payment receipt or the payment receipt issued by its respective unit.

4. After each household (industrial and commercial households take each trade association as one household) obtains the rice voucher, they should take the voucher to the designated warehouse to receive the rice.

(2) The representatives of each unit were appointed as members of the Low-Priced Rice Committee:

Public Welfare and Charitable Organizations: Ye Zhenquan

Banking Circles: Cao Boquan

Education Circles: Ni Tingchun

News and Cultural Circles: Guan Chunyi

Industrial Circles: Zhang Bofang

Business Circles: Dong Kaizhang

Municipal Government Representative: Shen Zuren (also serving as chairman)

(3) The order of priority for each unit to receive rice is as follows:

First, Public Welfare and Charitable Organizations

Second, News and Cultural Circles

Third, Education Circles

Fourth, Industrial Circles

Fifth, Business Circles

Sixth, Banking Circles

When each household (industrial and commercial households take each trade association as one household) receives rice, it will be managed by the representative of its respective unit, with the cooperation of the representatives of the other units. The date for receiving rice will be determined and announced separately.

(4) After each household receives rice, the sacks used to hold the rice should be sent back to its respective unit within ten days to be collected and sent to the warehouse, and each unit will be jointly responsible.

(5) All expenses for rice extraction, etc., in the warehouse are free of charge. After each household receives the rice, they will be responsible for the transportation expenses themselves.

(6) The Police Bureau is requested to issue an order to the police officers along the way, allowing them to exempt the transport of low-priced rice from inspection.

(7) The Municipal Chamber of Commerce introduced the Cargo Transportation Automobile Industry Association, which can handle transportation matters on behalf of others. The transportation fee is 500 yuan per stone. If each household wishes to entrust the matter, they can contact Director Cui Shifu of the association.

### Part-Time Civil Servants May Not Collect Distribution Items Concurrently

The Municipal Distribution Office believes that the distribution of goods is one of the wartime control policies, and everyone should understand the difficulties of the times and assist in implementation. It has recently been found that there are many part-time civil servants who are also collecting distribution certificates for goods concurrently. It has been heard that in the future, all key distribution personnel who hold part-time jobs and obtain double distribution of goods should automatically return the certificates to the service organization, which will then send them to the Distribution Office. Otherwise, once the fact is verified, in addition to suspending the distribution of goods to the individual, the service organization should also bear joint responsibility.

### Shen Bao's Key Distributions Must Be Submitted to the Municipal Government for Approval

Since the Municipal Distribution Office underwent a thorough reorganization, it has been implementing key food rice distribution since January. The distribution quantities and methods for various agencies and organizations have also been separately drafted and reported to the Municipal Government for record. It has been heard that regarding this type of key distribution, the Municipal Government has issued an order stating that except for those approved on file, they will be issued as usual. In the future, if an agency or organization directly requests the Distribution Office to issue goods, they must first submit a request to the Municipal Government for approval before the goods can be issued.

### Medical Gas Will Be Provided in Moderation

The Shanghai Gas Company has recently reduced gas supplies to general users starting this month due to a shortage of electricity and fuel. Therefore, it is notifying users that they must go to re-register. It is understood that a reasonable amount will still be supplied to those who require it for medical practices. Therefore, all practicing doctors in the city who need to use gas for their work can quickly register with the company.

### Improved Treatment for Municipal School Teachers and Staff

Since Mayor Zhou and Secretary-General Luo took office, the Municipal Government has been very concerned about the lives of teachers and staff in municipal schools. It is heard that Mayor Zhou has personally instructed Director Dai of the Municipal Education Bureau that, starting this semester in February, the treatment of teachers in municipal primary and secondary schools should be handled in accordance with the new treatment measures for civil servants. They will also be provided with three dou of rice per month free of charge to improve their lives. In addition, the method of salary payment based on qualifications established by the Municipal Education Bureau has also been submitted to the Municipal Government for approval and will be implemented starting this February. The bureau is currently assigning senior staff members to review each staff member's qualifications and documents day and night in order to determine their grade. The budget for the increased treatment expenses is also being drafted urgently for submission to the Municipal Government, so that it can be issued with the February expenses.

### Small Newspaper Improvement Content - Held a Discussion Meeting

The Municipal Propaganda Department, in order to supervise the content improvement of various small newspapers in the city, held a discussion meeting for responsible persons of small newspapers in its conference room at 2:00 PM yesterday (the 21st). Representatives from the Social Daily, Ji Bao, Opera World, In Shanghai Newspaper, Li Bao, Prosperity Newspaper, Ningbo Public Gazette, Hai Bao, Oriental Daily, Art Sea Daily, and Drama Daily were present. Director Liu, along with Secretary Yuan, Acting Section Chief Zhang, and Specialist Gu, presided over the meeting. They thoroughly explained the improvement issues of various small newspapers in the city. The key points for improvement included: (1) Increasing the amount of current affairs news; (2) Supporting government policies; (3) Not publishing or making arbitrary comments on unresolved civil and criminal cases in advance; (4) Writing social news interviews with a serious tone; (5) Not publishing attacks on individuals' private affairs; (6) Eliminating lewd and decadent erotic content; (7) Eliminating records of mysterious, bizarre, and absurd stories about gods; (8) Avoiding publishing text promoting improper businesses and gambling-related entertainment; (9) Not leaving blank spaces for censored parts; and (10) Cautiously publishing information on black market prices and industrial and commercial news. At the same time, they conveyed the opinions of Propaganda Minister Zhao and the municipal government authorities regarding various small newspapers in the city, with many words of encouragement. Secretary Yuan and Acting Section Chief Zhang also added their opinions. Wang Xuechen, a representative of the responsible persons of small newspapers, reported on the preparation process of the small newspaper association and stated that all newspapers were willing to unanimously follow the guidelines and gradually improve. The meeting adjourned at around 4:00 PM.

### Minister Izubuchi Discusses Impressions of Returning to Japan - The Japanese People's Belief in Victory is Firm

Lieutenant Colonel Izubuchi, Minister of the Army Press Department of the Allied Japanese Army in Shanghai, along with Lieutenant Maehara, Trustee Ejo, and others, met with the Chinese press corps of this city at the Hamilton House at 5:20 PM yesterday (the 21st). He gave a speech on his impressions of returning to Japan and explained the recent battle situation on the Yuehan Railway. The details are as follows:

Yuehan Battle Situation

Since the Japanese army successively occupied Xincun, Ganzhou, and Nanxiong on the southern section of the Yuehan Railway, the enemy's US-made operational bases have been completely destroyed and will not be able to resume operations. Yu Jiang had planned to use the southwest as a base for counterattacks, but their attempt was completely shattered after the Japanese army cut off and occupied the Xiang-Gui and Yuehan lines. The enemy's US air bases in the southwest and southeast were numerous, more than twenty, but because the above two lines were occupied, they could not repeat their old tricks. From the standpoint of the Japanese army's operations on the mainland, it is like one person fighting, holding a large knife in the left hand and a small knife in the right hand, and using the large knife to split open when necessary. Now the Japanese army has completed the posture with the large knife, and can at any time advance into Chongqing from the southwest and cut off the Stilwell Road between the US and Yu. The enemy US had claimed that an average of 25,000 tons of supplies were transported to Yu every day on the Stilwell Road, but the transportation on this road was inconvenient because of the lack of hotels, hospitals, repair shops, express trains, and other facilities along the way. The completion of this operation in southern Guangdong is like a knife at the throat, and the enemy can be dealt a fatal blow at any time. The US transportation commander also announced at a meeting with Chongqing reporters that more than 20 US air bases had been occupied by the Japanese army, and that after the Yuehan Road was cut off, the transportation between Manzhou and Guangdong would be opened up. Therefore, the US military's future landing operations on the mainland will be more difficult. The US is using military supplies to transport to Yu, with the purpose of using the manpower and terrain of Chongqing, regardless of the lives and property of the Chinese people, creating a tragic battlefield in China. Recently, the US has sent liaison officers to Yu again, and because they are under US orders, they often abuse their powers, resulting in conflicts from time to time.

Impressions of Returning to Japan

I returned to Japan at the end of January and arrived in Shanghai in early this month. What I often heard in Shanghai about the situation in Japan was slightly different from what I saw with my own eyes this time. Recently, the enemy's US Air Force has been bombing the Japanese mainland from time to time. The Japanese people not only have not been shaken by this, but are very stable. There is absolutely no panic in the bombed areas. On the 27th of last month, 90 enemy US planes bombed a few locations in Tokyo, causing fires, but the citizens were extremely calm about it and immediately organized fire-fighting efforts. There has been no actual loss from the recent bombings. Commodity prices are soaring in Shanghai, and I imagined that commodity prices in Japan must be the same as here, but in fact, there is no price increase. I could not even spend a five-yuan bill within a week, which shows the general level of prices. At the same time, the main food of the Japanese people is still very abundant, only vegetables, etc. are slightly limited. It is also generally imagined that Japan lacks human resources, but on January 27, after the air raid, young men and boys were everywhere, as crowded and bustling as on Nanjing Road in Shanghai. To summarize my impressions of Japan this time, in general, I am very pleased that the Japanese people's hearts are firm and their belief in the victory of the war is unwavering.

### Police Bureau Revamps Personnel - Adjusts Choices for Section Chiefs and Others

The Municipal Police Bureau is thoroughly adjusting personnel in order to revamp police administration.

### Industry Association Leaders Urge Compliance with Price Limits - Shops Exceeding Price Limits Will Be Punished Equally

In order to stabilize people's livelihoods, the Shanghai Special Municipality Economic Bureau has resolved to suppress the rising prices of major commodities. This time, under orders, it has taken emergency measures to manage prices, strengthened the organizational structure of the Municipal Price Review Committee, and approved new price limits for sixteen major commodities. (The coal blocks, rice, cotton yarn, cotton cloth, and flour series of products are already under household distribution and do not need to be evaluated). The announcement was made yesterday and has been implemented, and the general public of this city is celebrating. A Central News Agency reporter made a special visit to people in the economic sector. According to them, the new price limits approved by the economic authorities are still appropriate. This is because the bureau based the city price list of February 5th reported by various industries, and the newly hired specialized committee studied the cost of goods and provided legitimate profits to calculate and determine the market price that should be sold. After review by the Review Committee and approval by the Committee meeting, it can take care of the costs and profits of the business, and the public can buy goods with a certain standard, so that they will not be deceived by high prices. This kind of careful determination of price limits should be desired by both buyers and sellers. However, because the industrial and commercial elements in Shanghai are complex, it is inevitable that there will be secret high-price sales or hoarding and refusal to sell in the future. It is hoped that the relevant economic departments will fully cooperate and thoroughly investigate with an impartial attitude, and severely punish businesses that violate laws and sell goods at prices exceeding the limits, in order to achieve significant results.

(Another message) In order to strictly enforce the new price limits, the Municipal Economic Bureau specially convened a temporary meeting of the trade associations of major commodities at its office at 3:30 PM yesterday (the 21st), and ordered the chairmen of each association to urge their members to strictly comply with the new price limits for business operations. If any businesses are found to be selling goods at prices exceeding the limits, in addition to being sent to the executing authorities for punishment, the chairmen and directors of the affiliated associations will also be punished equally.

### Municipal Health Bureau Prepares for Meningitis Prevention

Recently, the weather has been gradually warming, and meningitis is very easy to occur. It is heard that the local health authorities in this city are actively preparing for preventive injections to prevent the spread of the disease.

### Pharmacist Association Relocates Office

The Shanghai Special Municipality Pharmacist Association has relocated to 431 Fuzhou Road, telephone number 97147, because its original office was insufficient for office work. The association recently received pharmacist certificates and approved lists issued by the health authorities. Those who have applied to the health department for issuance or renewal of pharmacist certificates can go in person during office hours to inquire.

### Yesterday's Sixth Charity Football Match: Overseas Chinese United Wins Against China United; China United Suffers a Narrow 1-0 Defeat

In the sixth charity football match, China United faced Overseas Chinese United. Yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM, the two teams clashed at the Racecourse Stadium. The players of China United lacked stamina and suffered a defeat at the hands of Overseas Chinese United, with a final score of 1-0. The first half ended without any goals. The performance of both teams was somewhat lackluster, lacking brilliance. Except for Huang Shijie's tenacious efforts and Li Tiansheng's stability, the other players of China United were mediocre, and the team lacked cohesion, resembling a pile of loose sand. Overseas Chinese United controlled the game from beginning to end. Tai'er Baoka displayed exceptional skills, and Otonilo received high praise. After Secretary-General Luo of the Municipal Government performed the opening kickoff ceremony, the two teams began to compete. Baojie of Overseas Chinese United made two probes into the opposing territory, but both were unsuccessful. China United, having been dormant for a while, moved into action, and Song Lingsheng obtained the ball and rushed forward, but was ultimately blocked by Ao Zhaonilo. Five minutes later, Overseas Chinese United attacked, and Bama searched near the goal, but was saved by Huang Shijie. The first half ended without any goals. In the second half, China United launched a strong counterattack, but their shots lacked power. Overseas Chinese United's momentum increased significantly. Baojie overcame obstacles, and Yu Lihua and Li Ning showed numerous vulnerabilities. Bao Fei kicked the ball, which entered the goal from under Li Tiansheng's feet, and China United lost a goal. After the goal, Overseas Chinese United dominated the game. Vera launched an offensive from the border, passing to Yatuomali, but Li Tiansheng cleared the ball with one kick. Overseas Chinese United became even more rampant. The players of Overseas Chinese United were seen running amok in China United's territory, but fortunately, there were no further losses. With only five minutes left in the game, China United's luck improved. Gao Baozheng and Sun Jinshun launched a dual attack. Sun made a fierce shot from twenty yards, but Tai'er Baoka made a desperate save, turning the danger into safety. Shortly after, time ran out, and Overseas Chinese United won a narrow victory.

Overseas Chinese United: Tai'er Baoka, Luo Xulai, Xiladi, Bolini, Otonilo, Xueweitai, Taikeini, Yatuomali, Bama, Baojie, Vera.

China United: Huang Shijie, Li Ning, Li Tiansheng, Yu Lihua, Tan Fuzhen, Meng Yiliang, Liu Zuru, Sun Jinshun, Song Lingsheng, Gao Baozheng, Yu Liming.

### Strict Prohibition of Establishing Shops within Schools

— Zhang Yizeng

At the second press conference held by the Municipal Propaganda Department on the 3rd of this month, a reporter from a certain newspaper raised the following question to the education authorities regarding the fact that some private schools in this city are openly operating shops within the school grounds: "Some schools are actually setting up shops and conducting business within the school premises. We wonder how the authorities intend to prohibit this." At the same time, he cited the example of a ham shop being set up in a certain middle school and requested an answer from the education authorities. Director Dai Yingfu of the Education Bureau replied, "Private schools in Shanghai still suffer from the remnants of the era of the British and American concessions. In the past, the licenses issued to schools by the Municipal Council were 'business licenses,' the same as those issued to teahouses and restaurants, which led to the idea that schools are also businesses. I feel extremely indignant about these remnants of commercialized schools. This is indeed a serious problem. I hope that the owners of these school shops can change their attitudes and engage in the fundamental educational undertakings of the country and society." Based on this, the fact that some private schools today are also engaged in business is an undeniable fact. Therefore, standing on the position of rescuing the increasingly corrupt Shanghai education sector, we feel the "seriousness" of this problem as deeply as the education authorities do. Entrusting the solution of this serious problem to the "owners of commercialized schools" to automatically "change their attitudes" may not be possible. The establishment of shops within schools and the open operation of business proves that the "owners of commercialized schools" have already disregarded the suspicion of "school commercialization." How can we expect them to change their attitude of viewing schools as businesses? Isn't that like "seeking skin from a tiger"? If this problem is not thoroughly resolved, the harm it causes will not only turn places of poetry and recitation into places of profit-seeking, but also the resulting fraud and disputes will affect social security and the implementation of the country's wartime legal system. Let us elaborate: Since the spring of this year, the amount of tuition fees charged by various private schools has increased dramatically by four or five times, while the improvement of the treatment of teaching and administrative staff has not been reasonably adjusted, resulting in frequent disputes between principals and teachers. The existence of this phenomenon will inevitably sacrifice the students' studies. Therefore, parents who bear huge tuition fees and expect their children to receive a good education will inevitably be drawn into this vortex of disputes and have grievances. The disorder of social order will inevitably increase the degree of tension. However, the origin of this phenomenon has other objective environmental conditions. The fundamental cause lies in the fact that "owners of commercialized schools" have the power to use tuition income as shop capital to seek exorbitant profits. The "owners of commercialized schools" possess this privilege because of the opportunity to mix schools and shops into one. Therefore, in other words, to eliminate this kind of dispute, we must first eradicate the opportunity for "owners of commercialized schools" to use idle funds to seek exorbitant profits. Therefore, it is undoubtedly necessary to prohibit the establishment of shops within schools. This is one point.

Secondly, after the government implemented the key allocation of food, and teachers and staff in the education sector also received key allocations, "owners of commercialized schools" used the opportunity of mixing their schools with commercial entities to list their staff and partners involved in shop business, or even hired drivers, cooks, maids, apprentices, etc., as teachers, staff, general affairs personnel, and school workers on key allocation application forms in order to deceive the government and fraudulently obtain extra allocated supplies. Such behavior actually uses skills to undermine the country's wartime allocation system. The impact is not limited to personal gains and losses, but even endangers the entire country's combat measures. Therefore, in order to eliminate the opportunity for "owners of commercialized schools" to cover up their criminal behavior, prohibiting the establishment of shops within schools is the most effective method. At the same time, from the standpoint of maintaining the national wartime system and achieving victory in the war, such actions should be severely punished. This is another point.

Thirdly, after the city's electricity has been repeatedly conserved, all kinds of businesses are feeling the need of the environment and cooperating with the authorities to save electricity. However, many "owners of commercialized schools," in this voice of saving electricity, used the reason that schools are "cultural institutions" to apply for special permission to use huge amounts of electricity. Even in the case of trams, which are indispensable for public transportation, they are sometimes stopped from running due to power saving. However, there are "owners of commercialized schools" who have installed three or four electric stoves in their "official residences" for heating purposes. At the time when families, who have their electricity supply cut off after 10 o'clock every night, use oil lamps instead of electric lights to continue their night work out of necessity for life, there are "owners of commercialized schools" who have their "official residences" brightly lit with electric lights for playing mahjong all night long. This kind of situation illustrates the opportunity for schools to become business opportunities, using the benefits of a few people to take the enjoyment of many people. At a time when the situation is becoming increasingly tense and the country and nation are falling into increasing difficulties, how the people should restrain themselves to strive for victory has become an indisputable argument. Now, if the "owners of commercialized schools," who claim to be responsible for education, have reached this state of absurdity, if they are not punished, the country and nation are no longer mentioned, and the social life of the people will also fall into a more difficult situation due to the increasing waste of public property. This cannot but prohibit the establishment of shops and "official residences" within schools. This is another point.

In summary of the above points, in order to rectify the discipline of the education sector, it is necessary to prohibit "school commercialization." In order to protect the allocated supplies and the public welfare enjoyment rights that the good people should be entitled to, prohibiting "school commercialization" is also a matter that should not be debated. As for the method of prohibition, it is ineffective to simply move them with moral concepts through the speech of the press. Many "owners of commercialized schools" regard the criticism of public opinion as "seeing the strange as not strange." Therefore, the security authorities must, after receiving reports of this kind of investigation, immediately send personnel to conduct on-site investigations. Once evidence is obtained, they should be severely punished so that the education undertaking on which the life of the country and nation depends can be maintained, the national combat system can be promoted, and the wartime social order can be stabilized.

### Discussion on Evacuating the Population

— Zhong Su

Regarding the issue of evacuating the population, we would like to offer our humble opinion as follows:

1.  The Population Evacuation Committee has already been organized, and funding has been secured. The only thing left to do is to implement it quickly. The committee should avoid simply talking and fully demonstrate the efficiency of taking action. Therefore:

(A) The committee should pay more attention to field personnel, widely recruit people who are familiar with the land transportation situation along the Beijing-Shanghai and Beijing-Shenyang routes, and who are honest, cautious, and courageous, to be responsible for guiding and coordinating the various tasks before and after the evacuation.

(B) The committee should send personnel to various counties and districts to work with the local authorities to survey the halls and houses of large families, monasteries and temples, orphanages, nursing homes, and other charitable groups in the city and the suburbs within ten miles of the city to accommodate the evacuated citizens.

(C) The committee should establish temporary offices in various counties and districts, and have the aforementioned personnel take care of the evacuated people upon their arrival at the stations and ports to avoid temporary chaos.

(D) The temporary offices should work with the authorities in various counties and districts to select strong and capable evacuated vagrants in each locality and assign them to tasks such as road repair, river dredging, and land reclamation, and provide them with military training to correct their bad habits.

2.  The registration of the evacuated population should be divided into voluntary and compulsory. This should be the responsibility of the district heads, baojia heads, and household heads, and assisted by the staff of the provincial and county associations. The former are familiar with the occupations of the citizens in the district, while the latter can cooperate and solve the various difficulties after their evacuation, based on their shared hometown ties. In addition to those who voluntarily register to return to their hometowns, those who have no legitimate occupation will try their best to avoid evacuation. The baojia heads, household heads, and police should search the districts, gather them together, and evacuate them first. The evacuation of these vagrants is compulsory and should be particularly focused on management and education. After arriving in the area, they should be assigned to various labor tasks based on their age, physical strength, and ability.

The evacuation work is difficult at the beginning, and it is even more difficult to do it well afterwards. This is what Secretary-General Luo repeatedly emphasized in his speech, and this is also why I have presented these humble views!

### Establishment of Buddhist Congee Kitchen and Literary and Art Assistance Society for Moral Education Translation

The entire board of directors of the Shanghai Buddhist Congee Kitchen, in view of the fact that most cultural undertakings have been suspended and literati are facing hardship, has specially established a Literary and Art Assistance Society for Moral Education Translation to collect manuscripts related to moral education and provide remuneration. The collection of manuscripts will begin on February 25th. The origins and regulations of the association are recorded as follows:

A time of turmoil is truly the misfortune of literati. Even the poet-saint Du Fu could not avoid his son starving to death. Since the incident, the literary life has been on the verge of extinction, and scholars have no way to make a living, sighing in despair, which is very pitiful! We believe that culture is the lifeblood of the nation, and the literati of an era are the maintainers of the culture of an era. People with status and wealth in society should hold this concern in their hearts and establish various translation undertakings so that those who make a living by writing can barely survive the difficulties, which is also the way to continue the cultural life of an era. The colleagues of this factory, in view of the urgency of this undertaking, have specially allocated 300 dan of flour from the grain reserves to establish the Literary and Art Assistance Society for Moral Education Translation, and will first translate moral education books as an example. We hope that all people with enthusiasm and necessity in various fields will continue to establish other translation and assistance societies, or subsidize the expansion of this association, to achieve the purpose of universally saving all the ladies in Shanghai, helping the poor scholars and rescuing the civilization, which is a double benefit and creates boundless blessings. The regulations are now set as follows:

(1) The manuscripts received should focus on works related to moral education, such as self-cultivation, governing the world, protecting life, and promoting education.

(2) The writing style should be simple and lively vernacular (such as the illustrated stories of Li Zhipin in the Luohancai magazine and Li Yuanjin's Mingdeng for Dealing with the World).

(3) Remuneration: Grade A is 3 jin of flour per 1,000 characters, Grade B is 2 jin of flour per 1,000 characters. After submitting the manuscript, take the voucher to the liaison office on the eighth day to collect the flour.

(4) Literati who have previously engaged in translation and writing work can submit their unpublished works and the topics they intend to translate and write for solicitation, and the translation can be agreed upon if they are suitable.

(5) Scholars with specialized knowledge in academics can write at will, but the content should be beneficial to the world and people's hearts, or texts that are useful for medicine, agriculture, industry, etc.

(6) For lengthy manuscripts, a small portion can be submitted for review. If the review is successful, advance royalties can be paid.

(7) Liaison office: Upstairs of Sanle Agricultural Products Company, No. 685 Nanjing Road, Shanghai. Time: Every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday from 1:00 PM to 3:00 PM. Shanghai Buddhist Congee Kitchen Entire Board of Directors respectfully.

### Diamond Rings and Gold Watches Donated for Charity Sale

(1) This office received a letter from Mr. Ren yesterday, stating, "Respectfully, a new year begins and all things are renewed. At the beginning of the year, the poor are threatened by life, displaced, and crying from hunger and cold. How urgent is the need for relief! This official is heartbroken and deeply worried. Since I can still afford to be warm and full, I am sending to your office one 3-point, one 5-point, and one 18K gold watch for auction at the marked price of 300,000 yuan, all of which will be donated to your office's six relief projects. Mencius said: 'Yu thought of the world as if the weak were drowning, and he himself was drowning. Ji thought of the world as if the hungry were starving, and he himself was starving.' I hope that the great philanthropists in the country will contribute money and effort, and let the righteous deeds succeed, which will not only be a deep blessing for me, but also a blessing for society."

(2) Mr. Xu Jufang wrote in a letter, "Your office is carrying out various charitable undertakings, which benefit the poor and are worthy of admiration. However, my financial resources are meager and there is no way to respond, which I always feel uneasy about. I am now offering a US-made "SAVAFAL" rubber mat for the bathtub. When laid in the bathtub, it can prevent slipping. I am willing to part with it for a charity sale with a minimum bid of 70,000 yuan, half of which is intended to be donated to student aid and half to be used for orphaned children's subsidies. I hope that you will advocate and lead, so that the great philanthropists in the country will come out to help, so that the effect of relief can be enhanced. I look forward to it!"

### Longevity for the People

Madame Zhou, the respected mother of the Zhu Shaoji and Zhu Jingshan brothers of the Zhongxing Thermos Factory, reached the age of seventy. Relatives and friends all wanted to offer a toast to congratulate her. However, Madame Zhou knew that times were difficult and the people were suffering to the extreme, so she resolutely cut back on the expenses of feasts and wine, firmly declined the gifts from relatives and friends, and increased the amount to 200,000 yuan to help ten charitable organizations. Madame Zhou did not want to burden her relatives and friends for her own sake, but insisted on doing it herself. This is truly the heart of a kind and compassionate person, and it is appropriate for her to enjoy longevity and a long life. The names of the groups that received donations are listed below: Factory United Hospital, China Child Welfare Association, Fuyou Orphanage, Leprosy Relief Association, Xinwenbao Student Loan, Pushan Villa, China Education Relief Association, Xinpuyu Hall, Vagrant Labor Camp, and this office's Poverty Relief and Abandoned Rights, each with 20,000 yuan, totaling 200,000 yuan.

### New Year's Group Gathering and Donation of Gift Money to Charity

Respectfully, in order to promote frugality and help the poor, we initiated a New Year's group gathering last year, and the gift money collected, after deducting the tea expenses, was all donated to charitable organizations. This year, we followed the example and held it at the Jinmen Hotel on the second day of the Lunar New Year. A total of 89 people participated, and the gift money collected, after deducting expenses for refreshments and printing costs, etc., still had a surplus of 111,120 yuan in national currency. We have already donated 11,120 yuan for student aid, and the remaining 100,000 yuan will be donated to the Nursing Home and the Child Welfare Association, 30,000 yuan each, and 10,000 yuan each to your office's Small Loan Fund, Medical Assistance Fund, Elementary School Medical Assistance Fund, and Maternity Assistance Fund, to create blessings for all friends in the new year. Handled by Jiang Yuping, Du Hannan, Ji Ruitang, Li Shouchang, Xu Linsen, Sun Kejian, Ning Shaoquan, and Xiong Juju, together respectfully.

### The Experience of Meditation

— Chen Bennian

I live at 103 Chongqing Road, near the Yinshi Meditation Society. In the autumn of the 33rd year [of the Republic, i.e. 1944], I joined the sixth class. At first, when I meditated, I felt that all kinds of thoughts were gathering, and my mind was not at peace. Moreover, I was not used to sitting cross-legged. The teacher said that I would get used to it over time, and that I should not be afraid or discouraged. After two months, there were dozens of people meditating together. One person in front was shaking his shoulders and back slightly. I found it strange, so I practiced diligently. On the third day after the Mid-Autumn Festival, at 6:00 AM, while meditating, I suddenly felt my legs shaking uncontrollably. At first, I thought it was accidental. Gradually, the shaking reached my chest and abdomen, and my hands came out of their grip and made a hugging gesture, rotating like the wind, alternately clockwise and counterclockwise, thirty-six turns each. My head shook left and right, forward and backward, also thirty-six times. That day, I rushed to the teacher's place to report the experience. He said that this was the initial vibration. The next day, when I met the class, because my vibration was too strong, the furnishings in the room were all shaken. At midnight on the winter solstice of the lunar calendar, I slept alone in the quilt, lying on my back, not sitting cross-legged, and tried to do it according to the method, and I could also vibrate, and gradually felt pain in the tailbone, with hot air rising straight up to my back, and my shoulders and back shook incessantly because of it, straight up to the neck bone, from the top of my head to my eyebrows, then my eyes opened and closed non-stop, sometimes staring wide open, my eyeballs rotating left and right, splitting from the nasal root and down, and my nostrils also flapped, and the upper and lower jaws, cheeks, and alveolar bones all vibrated. My heart was calm and not disturbed. At that time, the tip of my tongue was tightly against the upper palate, and the inside also suddenly vibrated, stirring and stretching incessantly, and from this it gradually calmed down, returning from the chest and abdomen to the navel dantian. This happened every time I meditated after that. I reported to the teacher in the society, and he was surprised and said that other than Shen Yinmei, no one had achieved such a rapid effect. He said that my three passes had been opened, and that I should take good care of myself. Meditation is a method of preventing disease and prolonging life. Prolonging life depends on each person's foundation, but preventing disease can be achieved by everyone. The country of the sick is really the right medicine for the disease. The Meditation Society is now recruiting members for the seventh class, which will start in early March. Because I have gained such great benefits, I dare not keep it a secret, and I will tell those who are interested about my experience.
