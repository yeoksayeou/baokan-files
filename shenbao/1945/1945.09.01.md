### Post-War Tokyo Pilgrimage: A Scene of Devastation and Desolation

Tokyo, 31st – Reuters correspondent Mr. Lutz, dispatched to Tokyo, sent a telegram yesterday describing his first impressions of post-war Tokyo. Mr. Lutz was among the first group of American soldiers and four journalists to arrive in Japan, landing at Atsugi Airfield. He described, "This morning, as I traveled along the roads between Tokyo and Yokohama, I briefly saw the bombed-out Japanese Imperial Palace. The ground in Tokyo and Yokohama is scorched by bomb blasts, but compared to Germany, the horrifying scenes in Berlin are far worse than in these two cities. The right side of the famous Imperial Hotel in Tokyo, which was not toppled by the great earthquake of 1923, has been destroyed by bombs, but the interior of the hotel remains intact and has electricity and water. Such a sight would be considered a miracle in Berlin. Streetcars in various districts of Tokyo are still running, but most of the residential areas are scarred and bridges are generally passable. The damage suffered by Japan is not absolute devastation. Of all the residents in Tokyo, approximately four million have evacuated to other places, and those remaining in the city have become homeless wanderers, most of them poorly clothed. Our super fortresses, bombers, and fighter planes fly frequently overhead, and the general Japanese public looks up at them, some with an expression akin to those in concentration camps. The city has a sense of quiet solitude."

### Hardships of Life: Shortage of Clothing and Food

A group of seven reporters from the Associated Press arrived here on the 7th, and the scene in the capital of Japan is bleak. American reporters traveled freely today without obstruction. The contrast between the great Chinese city of Shanghai, which the reporter witnessed yesterday, and Tokyo after the bombing is stark. Shanghai was hardly bombed, while Tokyo has become a pile of ruins. Although the destructive power of the U.S. Air Force is a strange monument, the residents of the city do not seem to react to the first American people to arrive. Most Japanese people who met with reporters seem to be weary of the war, and the general public also has no reaction. When asked for help, they come forward with some hesitation. A certain Japanese politician was an exception, rushing to the Imperial Hotel reception room to tell me, "I am very pleased to meet you. I have never expressed support for this war." As the reporter drove out of the suburbs of Tokyo on the first trip on a path soaked with the ashes of the celebration of the ashes, Japanese children waved and cheered at us, but middle-aged people were not so enthusiastic. The food supply here is extremely poor, and the food at the Imperial Hotel, which is supposed to be the best in Japan, is also unpalatable. There are very few streetcars in the city and even fewer buses. Burned vehicles can be seen everywhere. The train between Yokohama and Tokyo is still running, but Tokyo's main eastern station has been destroyed. Pedestrians on the road seem healthy, but their clothing is not adequate. Japanese ladies are no longer as they were before the war, wearing only ordinary clothes.

### A Collection of Brief News

Chongqing, 31st (Central News Agency) – According to a telegram from the U.S. News Service aboard a warship in Tokyo on the 29th, Nimitz said today that the lack of hostile behavior from the Japanese people during the Allied landing is due to the Allied nations retaining the Emperor.

Kato, who was a Domei correspondent in Washington D.C. when the war broke out, said that the Japanese Imperial Government has almost completely disarmed all Kamikaze attack teams, and the occupation is not expected to encounter any major difficulties. The main actions that may cause danger have been monitored, and the Japanese secret police have been disbanded. It is true that many officials in the Imperial Palace have committed collective suicide, and hundreds of ordinary people throughout Japan have committed suicide.

Chongqing, 31st – According to a broadcast from Tokyo on the 31st, after the Allied occupation forces entered Yokohama yesterday, they immediately reached an understanding with the Kanagawa Prefecture police authorities and established ten checkpoints around their garrison area, located at the police stations at the foot of ten bridges, with one end guarded by the Allied forces.

It has recently been learned that some outside parties have been separately discussing celebration methods, raising funds under the guise of celebration, especially Baojia personnel, such as the Laoba Association, collecting 50,000 yuan per Jia as comfort funds for the National Army, without giving receipts, and collecting goods in kind, which is illegal. It is reported that the committee has, in addition to advising against this, requested all agencies to strictly stop it. If all sectors have opinions or are being extorted, they can report to the committee office at 65 Gordon Road. (Dagong News Agency)

Also, the Shanghai City Celebration of Victory General Assembly Preparatory Committee is handling the registration of community organizations participating in the celebration. Yesterday, the community organizations that went to register were very enthusiastic. Registration is scheduled to close on the 20th of next month.

### News Censorship

--- Cheng

The Shanghai News Censorship Office has been established, and censorship of newspapers begins today.

From the perspective of us news workers, we very much hope that there will be a rational and good censorship system. Because news workers may sometimes be biased toward subjective emotions in the articles they publish, and although it is not intentional, it is inevitable that there will be discrepancies with the authorities' policies. With a censorship mechanism, after objective analysis, it can be pointed out for correction so that it does not conflict with the authorities' policies.

Therefore, censors and news workers are actually in an equal position of mutual support. We only have one hope, and that is that those who are actually responsible for censorship must understand the principles of the censorship standards and be able to use them flexibly. It should be an attitude of pointing out errors, not an attitude of fault-finding. Then, we believe that censors and news workers will be able to work together as one and contribute to the entire news industry.

### "Refugees" for Two Years (Part 2)

--- Yan Fu

The endless winter days still passed quickly, and thinking of home thousands of miles away added to a lot of melancholy.

Last April, I received news of the death of my younger brother N, which caused me great pain in my mind. Every time I think of him, I truly regret that I shouldn't have brought him to this city thousands of miles away from home, to be sacrificed for that bit of life in this turbulent sea.

Whenever I was alone, on quiet nights, I recited from memory the mournful; "Sacrifice to Twelfth Brother Article!" or "Sacrifice to Sister Article!" This can slightly relieve the sorrow in my heart!

"Living, my shadow does not stay by my side, dying, my soul does not meet in my dreams!"

"Apart from my death, there will be no time to meet. I do not know when I will die, that I may see you, and whether I will know or not know after death, and whether I can see you or not see you, is difficult to understand! ... Embracing this boundless regret, Heaven's hand, or man's! ..." Reading these quiet sentences, my bitter tears quietly fell by my side. This situation has made my whole life wither.

What else do I hope for? Can I see my younger brother N again with my best effort? Even if I can gain light by living in this world, my light has a black spot.

I continue to weave straw bags day after day, from spring to winter, from morning to evening, forever and ever. I feel that these tasks are too light, and I hate that they are not troublesome enough, not hard enough. I want to live a life a million times harder than the current life of a beast of burden, to be whipped so that I can't breathe, so that I hate life - with nothing to miss, and don't give me any hope. This way, my heart will feel a little lighter.

Therefore, I will forget everything, forget the death of my younger brother N, or rather feel that his death is eternal rest, and it is fortunate to get rid of the shackles of life.

However, the director transferred me to another job a month ago, and life is better than before. Every day I am getting closer to these complicated words again. I am very grateful for the director's promotion, but who can I tell the taste in my heart to?

I think I will leave here one day. On the day I leave here, I will first go to my younger brother N's grave to tell him about the things after we parted, the cruel story of the world, or the sad story that also exists in heaven.

I stagger with lost steps, carrying a soulless body, living in the world. Even if I can get light, my light has a black spot. (The End)

### Blue Sky White Sun

--- Du Se

The war has dragged on for eight years. We try to look at the blue sky, and it is still so clear; we look at the white sun again, and it is still so round, shining its light and giving people new vitality; but let's look down at the ground, ah! It's covered with the hot blood of loyal and brave soldiers!

Hot blood is red, so red that it is dazzling! Reminding people of the cruelty of war!

However, without our brave soldiers staining the earth with hot blood, could we see this blue sky and white sun again? No! Never! Perhaps we would have long been robbed by the god of death, or imprisoned by the invaders in hell, never seeing the (blue) sky (white) sun!

Therefore, the meaning of hanging the national flag is that, in addition to celebrating, we should also pay the highest respect to the soldiers who have shed hot blood for the motherland, to commemorate their immortal achievements! Because the color of the national flag is a combination of blue (sky), white (sun), and (red earth), it symbolizes: freedom, equality, and fraternity!
