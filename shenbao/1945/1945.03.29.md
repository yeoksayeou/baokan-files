### Northern Jiangsu Security Forces Strengthen Their Strength

Central News Agency, Taixing - Since General Sun Liangcheng took over as Director of the Northern Jiangsu Pacification Headquarters, he has strengthened the organization and achieved considerable success. The most prominent achievement is the strengthening of Taixing's military defenses, the gateway to northern Jiangsu. The First General Security Force of Northern Jiangsu was established, and Cai Xinyuan, the former commander of the 19th Division, was appointed as the commander-in-chief to enhance work efficiency and completely eliminate the Communist bandits. After receiving the order, General Cai actively strengthened the equipment of the various units. The organization is similar to that of the security command headquarters in various provinces. Under the commander-in-chief, there are several regiments, six battalions, and special task force, communication, and intelligence units. Other departments include political training, secretariat, military law, staff, adjutant, quartermaster, ordnance, and clothing departments. In addition to strengthening the troops, the city defenses have recently been rebuilt, and strongholds in various areas have been strengthened to ensure the smooth progress of the military work of eliminating the Communist bandits. The Communist bandits who were lurking in various areas have all been forced to leave.

### Gathering Ideas and Jointly Planning Good Strategies to Provide Reference for Government Policy Acting Chairman Chen's Instructions to Congress Representatives

Nanjing, 28th (Central News Agency) - Acting Chairman Chen's instructions to the Wartime People's Congress of Various Provinces and Cities: The Wartime People's Congress of Various Provinces and Cities, initiated by representatives of all sectors of the capital, is now solemnly held in the National Assembly Hall in the capital. Representatives from various places have come to Nanjing from afar, enduring hardships. This is not only a manifestation of the patriotic enthusiasm of all of you, but also demonstrates the strong sense of national responsibility among the people of the whole country. As this Greater East Asia War has entered a critical stage, and the nation and the people are facing an unprecedented crisis, the assembly of national people's representatives has profound significance. China today is scarred and bandits are everywhere, and overall peace has not yet been achieved. Survival is in imminent danger. While we are inspired, we should be doubly vigilant and be mindful of the heavy responsibility. The late Chairman Wang once instructed us that the survival and independence of a country and a nation depends on how the people's minds, strength, and material resources are gathered and used. From this, it can be seen that the people are the foundation of the country, and this principle is eternally unchanging. Furthermore, he said that only when the people's strength is enriched can the national strength be expanded. Only when the people's livelihood is stable can the people's strength be enriched. Therefore, the most important thing in construction is the stability of the people's livelihood. During the war, the difficulties of the people's livelihood are increasing day by day. This is not only the case in our country, but also in all countries in the world. However, we must recognize that all the old pains suffered by the Chinese people are due to the reactionary forces in the old order. It is useless to be unwilling to endure hardship and only blame heaven and others. The suffering of the nation and the people can only be relieved by the efforts of the Chinese people. The personal suffering of the Chinese people can only be relieved after the suffering of the nation and the people is relieved.

China has been bound by British and American imperialism from the outside and disrupted by warlords and Communist bandits from the inside for decades. The national strength and the people's lives have been exhausted. To seek the freedom and liberation of the nation and the restoration and construction of the country, we must follow the teachings of the Father of the Nation and inherit the legacy of the late Chairman Wang. The whole country, from top to bottom, must work together, strive for independence and freedom externally, and strive for peace and unity internally, and move forward bravely to achieve success. Five years ago, we had no weapons in our hands and called for peace. We knew that peace and unity were necessary for construction, and only in the process of construction could overall peace be promoted. The three major programs of "peace, anti-communism, and nation-building" proclaimed at the time of the return to the capital were to strive for national freedom through peace, to achieve national unity through anti-communism, and to consolidate national independence through nation-building. The facts of the past five years have proven the national policy of "peace, anti-communism, and nation-building" and have further proven the inseparability of the construction of Greater East Asia and the liberation of the Chinese nation. In the future, the whole country, from top to bottom, should further strengthen the implementation of this national policy, further promote overall peace, national unity, and strive for the realization of permanent peace in East Asia. We must also implement the late Chairman Wang's call for working hard on construction under the leadership of the central force and struggle together.

Today, the people's representatives from all over the country are gathered together. They are all leading figures from all walks of life. Studying national affairs from the people's standpoint will surely gather ideas and jointly plan good strategies to contribute to the government. It is hoped that everyone will fully express the will of the people so as to provide a reference for the government's policy-making and to establish the belief in nation-building and widely implement it. At present, the war situation is serious, and the people are eager for governance. The government also has high expectations for the gains of this conference and is willing to work together with everyone.

### Overall War Results Near Okinawa 31 Enemy Ships Sunk More Than 150 Enemy Planes Shot Down or Damaged

Tokyo, 28th (Central News Agency) - According to reconnaissance on the 27th, the enemy's mobile fleet near Okinawa, in addition to battleships, cruisers, and destroyers, also contains four groups of minesweepers. The first group is east of Okinawa Island, the second group is west of the island, and the third group is cruising near the Kerama Islands. Among them, the enemy's second group, every four groups, continued to shell Okinawa Island on the 27th, but the intensity was not as high as on the 26th. They retreated that night. On the other hand, enemy carrier-based aircraft attacked various parts of Okinawa on the 27th with about 430 aircraft. Again, from 8:45 AM, enemy cruisers and destroyers shelled Kume Island, and from 11:00 AM to the morning of the 28th, enemy fleets containing battleships shelled Minami Daitō Island separately. The results of the Japanese interception of these enemy raiders, which were announced by the General Headquarters on the 27th, and the subsequent results are listed below: (1) On the 26th, one battleship, two destroyers, three cruisers, one cruiser or destroyer, and four destroyers were sunk, and one cruiser was destroyed. In addition, one battleship was hit by a 500 kg direct-hit bomb. One battleship and two cruisers were hit by torpedoes. One battleship was hit by a 250 kg direct-hit bomb. Also, the sound of a torpedo exploding on a battleship was heard. If the already announced results are added, then the overall results of the Japanese side in the Okinawa waters up to the 27th are as follows: one battleship, four cruisers, one cruiser or destroyer, five large ships, and six destroyers sunk. Six large ships were hit or heavily damaged. Five battleships, three cruisers, and one destroyer were destroyed. 44 aircraft were shot down, and about 110 were destroyed. In total, the Japanese side achieved the great results of sinking 17 ships, sinking or heavily damaging 5 ships, destroying 9 ships, shooting down 44 aircraft, and destroying 110 aircraft.

### B-29 Enemy Planes Night Raid on Northern Kyushu More Than Ten Shot Down

Tokyo, 28th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese General Headquarters announced at 11:30 AM on the 28th: Sixty to seventy B-29 aircraft attacked northern Kyushu again at about 10:30 on the 27th. The attacks lasted for one and a half hours, with two night raids. The damage was minimal, and more than ten enemy aircraft were shot down.

### US Tank Unit Vanguard Arrives in the Ruhr Area

Berlin, 28th (Central News Agency) - German military authorities announced: The vanguard of the US armored forces arrived in the Ruhr (Lohr, 60 kilometers east of Frankfurt) industrial area on the 27th. The fighting at the confluence of the Rhine and Main rivers is gradually intensifying. The main force of the US Third Army under Patton seems to be targeting southern Germany.

### Preparing for the General Counter-Offensive on the Mainland

Due to the rapid advance of the American Pacific offensive, the mainland front is increasingly showing the ominous signs of an impending decisive battle. The US Commander in Chongqing, Weitmier, who is like a "newborn calf not afraid of the tiger", dared to challenge the million elite Japanese troops in China, saying that he was willing to fight a decisive battle with Japan on the mainland. Song Ziwen, the Acting President of the Executive Yuan in Chongqing, has also repeatedly formally declared that a general counter-offensive on the mainland will be carried out this year. To prove these statements, the actions of anti-Japanese China that are worthy of attention have recently become increasingly clear. The main purpose of the Chongqing regime is, of course, to eliminate the Axis powers, but the enemy's preparations for the general counter-offensive, as long as there is a relationship of infighting between the US and Chongqing, then from the standpoint of the internal problems of anti-Japanese China, it is questionable whether the mainland offensive can go smoothly.

Starting to Reorganize and Train the Chongqing Army

From the superficial current stage, there are three key factors that determine the nature of the general counter-offensive on the mainland: namely, (1) after the opening of the Chongqing-India highway, (2) the development of the Kuomintang-Communist problem, and (3) the various situations arising from the convocation of the Sixth Plenary Session in Chongqing.

The Chongqing-India highway, renamed the Stilwell Road, which was opened at the end of February, has now formed the main artery for the preparation of the general counter-offensive. At the same time, it is also impossible not to pay attention to the fact that this will become the back door for the continuous intrusion of American forces. When Chongqing opened this highway, it newly established a Wartime Transportation Administration, entrusting it to US Army Chief of Staff Mark Looia for management. Then, from the beginning of February, it began to reorganize and train the Chongqing army.

The content of the military reorganization is the cooperation between General Weitmier, the US Army Commander in Chongqing, Major General Mark Looia, Chief of Staff Ho Yingchin, and Minister of Military Administration Chen Cheng. It was decided to implement the replacement of the commander and staff of each Chongqing army division, equip each army with American staff, equip each regiment with American artillery or tank teams, and equip each transport unit with American machine gun teams or engineering teams. In February, the central and local armies in Sichuan, Guizhou, and Shaanxi provinces were reorganized. From March, the armies in Yunnan and Gansu provinces were reorganized, and then gradually expanded to other provinces. At the same time, the Rear Service Headquarters was established, with US Army Commander in Kunming Swasey and Major General Liu Qi as the commander and deputy commander, responsible for the supply of weapons, ammunition, and military food for the military reorganization. Ho Yingchin took office as the Commander-in-Chief of the Army and Air Force, and Guizhou and Yunnan were divided into two major expeditionary army border areas. In order to make China's southwest military position the largest stronghold for the general counter-offensive, the Chongqing regime separated military and political power and moved the main military institutions to Kunming, establishing the Supreme Command of the Chinese Army. Along with Ho Yingchin, American generals Sinode (Commander of the US 14th Air 定隊 stationed in Chongqing) and Swasey also moved to Kunming.

A Prelude to Landing in China

The purpose of this military action is to know that Chongqing is paying attention to Vietnam and South China because Chiang Kai-shek is the commander of the joint forces of Thailand, Vietnam, and South China. But what is more noteworthy is that the initiative for the general counter-offensive that Chongqing shouts about every day has already been transferred to the hands of the American army. According to Chiang Kai-shek's ambition, on the surface, he seems to want to cooperate with the pace of the American army landing in China, but in reality, he wants to stand by and watch the decisive battle between the Japanese and American armies. However, the outline of the counter-offensive preparation has already been controlled by the American army. The failed attempt of former US Army Commander Stilwell has been gradually completed by the hands of the current Weitmier and Mark Looia. Due to the opening of the Chongqing-India highway, the US army has quickly controlled the Chongqing army, which is a prelude to the US army landing in mainland China.

The situation of the deep penetration of American power into China can be seen in all sectors of the inland wartime economy. The local supplies of the US army have even reached the point of self-sufficiency in China. In terms of material supply, the American economic war against Japan has already been manifested in the war zone. For example, the Chongqing authorities, according to the instructions of the US-Chongqing Joint Production Committee under the Wartime Production Bureau, are purchasing copper coins and zinc, etc., but the exchange rate between the heavy Chongqing currency, which is guaranteed by American gold bars, and the Central Reserve Bank has changed from the previous ratio of two to one to a ratio of one to fourteen. The American power's invasion of China is by no means limited to the wartime economic sector, but in order to enhance the anti-Japanese power, the Chongqing regime has even fallen into the position of not being able to refuse the American interference in internal affairs from the front.

US Obtains Dominance in Chongqing

The Yan'an problem is a good example. Yan'an representative Zhou Enlai went to Chongqing for more than two weeks of negotiations. The Chongqing side had to make considerable concessions because Yan'an had the support of American democratic forces. But in the end, Yan'an was dissatisfied with Chongqing's refusal to relax the "family world" policy, and Zhou Enlai returned to Yan'an in anger on the 14th. According to the statement of Chongqing Propaganda Minister Wang Shijie, it can be known that Chongqing has decided to recognize the legal status of Yan'an. Yan'an representatives can participate in the Military Commission, organize a wartime cabinet of the Kuomintang with representatives from Yan'an and other parties, and reorganize the Eighth Route Army, which will be supplemented by the central government. Recently, the Chongqing authorities have instructed all provinces to organize joint government committees and have also donated ten tons of medical supplies donated by the United States to the International Memorial Hospital in Yan'an. Chongqing's having to make concessions is also due to the United States interfering in China's internal affairs on the grounds that China's disunity will weaken the anti-Japanese forces. After the breakdown of the Kuomintang-Communist negotiations, US Commander Weitmier in Chongqing declared his support for Chongqing on February 15, which is a noteworthy event. According to Weitmier's position, when the United States has already obtained dominance in Chongqing's military, political, and economic aspects, it is naturally unwilling to support the more democratic Yan'an politics. In reality, this is equivalent to the greatest insult to Chongqing. Needless to say, the important people in Chongqing also know this very well, so Chongqing is busy with eliminating dissidents and strengthening the Kuomintang's efforts to unify China by force.

Japanese Side Pays Attention to Decisive Battle Strategies

The Sixth Plenary Session will be convened on May 5 this year, followed by the Thirteenth Plenary Session, the Fourth Political Participation Council, and the National Assembly, etc., with the aim of testing the Chinese people's ability to tolerate Chongqing. Recently, Chiang Kai-shek has always stated to the military, political, and civilian parties in Chongqing that the important issue at present is not the dictatorial system or the livelihood system, but the awakening of the Chinese people themselves. However, Chongqing's basic policy of anti-Japanese resistance and nation-building has to rely on the United States due to military requirements, because the Chongqing government cannot launch a counter-offensive alone. Chongqing is clamoring for a general counter-offensive against Japan this year, but whether Chongqing will achieve an autonomous counter-offensive or be controlled by the United States will be a major issue. The direction of anti-Japanese China depends on the situation of the direct attack on the Japanese mainland by the enemy's American army in the Pacific, but the above-mentioned phenomena are the factors that determine the nature of the enemy's general counter-offensive on the mainland. Our Japan should pay full attention to this point in our mainland decisive battle strategy. (Translated by Lin from the March 9 Mainichi Shimbun)

Editorial

### On China Mainland Operations

The enemy Americans, in their Pacific operations, have advanced from Saipan to the Philippines to Iwo Jima, and recently have attempted a landing on Okinawa Island. Consequently, some people believe that the enemy Americans' strategic policy has already changed, abandoning operations on the mainland and advancing toward the Japanese homeland. However, observing the recent situation of the overall Greater East Asia war situation, while it is true that the enemy Americans have a trend of invading the Japanese homeland, at the same time, they will absolutely not abandon the attempt to operate on the Chinese mainland. This cannot be ignored.

Why do we say that the enemy, while invading the Japanese homeland, will never abandon the strategy of turning China into a battlefield?

First, considering the enemy Americans' political and military strategies, their true goal in the war against Japan lies in restoring their colonies in the Far East and further realizing their dominance over the Pacific. To achieve this goal, they must, at the very least, simultaneously subdue Japan and China. Invading the Japanese homeland is the most important and most risky move to subdue Japan, but it still cannot realize the dream of dominating the Pacific because China has not yet been subdued, and moreover, there is the Soviet Union watching in the north! Therefore, in the enemy Americans' political and military strategies to subdue Japan, they must simultaneously subdue China. Thus, in the operation against the Japanese homeland, they will simultaneously prepare and implement mainland operations, achieving their ambition to subdue China at the same time under the guise of assisting Chongqing.

Second, considering the enemy British's political and military strategies, due to circumstances, it is no longer possible to dream of dominating the Far East again. However, how to restore their past status in the Far East is something that Churchill and others have not forgotten for years! Although they lack the strength to take risks against the Japanese homeland, the only way they can compete with the enemy Americans is to cooperate in the mainland war. This is the strategic policy that the enemy British are actively deploying, which cannot be ignored.

Third, considering the political and military strategies of the Chongqing government and the Communists, Chongqing, under the current situation, is held hostage by the enemy Americans. It cannot make peace with Japan, and in order to maintain its regime, it cannot help but shout about preparing for a general counter-offensive. As for the Chinese Communists, they have always made their start from creating turmoil. After the mainland becomes a battlefield, the chaos of war will create conditions for their development. Therefore, they are very actively promoting a general counter-offensive against Japan.

The trend of turning the mainland into a battlefield is determined by the political and military strategies of the Americans, British, Chongqing government, and Communists. Today, this newspaper is translating and publishing the "Preparation for General Counter-Offensive on the Mainland" article from the Mainichi Shimbun, which will make this even clearer. However, what is the future of turning the mainland into a battlefield? The editorial "Mainland Operations and the Chinese People" in the Mainland New Daily on March 26 also has extremely noteworthy indications. The enemy's strategy may be to land along the coast, coordinating with Chongqing's so-called general counter-offensive, as well as bombing, all conducted simultaneously or staggered. Considering today's mainland strategic terrain, the Japanese army has already been distributed to various strategic strongholds and key transportation bases in major ports. Therefore, it is absolutely impossible for the enemy to achieve a quick victory. The war situation will inevitably be prolonged! However, with the long coastline of the mainland and the difficulty of coordinating the Chongqing Communist troops, the enemy Americans' landing can only cause significant sacrifices to China's coastal economic and cultural construction and the people. Therefore, for the sake of the survival of the country and the nation, we should do everything possible to oppose the Americans, British, Chongqing government, and Communists' mainland operations that sacrifice China. At the same time, the Greater East Asia War is a whole. Whether it is operations on the Japanese homeland or operations on the Chinese mainland, the military and civilians of both China and Japan should regard them as a common operation against the enemy of the same nature, without distinction between each other, and strive for victory with all their strength. Therefore, how to promote greater unity and cooperation between China and Japan to meet the arduous task of the decisive battle is the most urgent issue that the authorities of both China and Japan need to grasp at present. As the Mainland New Daily argues: "Mainland operations are the most intense military war, and at the same time, it is also a political war and ideological war to win over the Chinese people… In this regard, in order to truly win over the Chinese people, Japan must reflect on its past policies and implement various new and decisive measures."

In short, in addition to military strength, the fundamental determining factor is still the political power of both sides, that is, the direction of the people's hearts. Whoever can grasp the hearts of the largest majority of the people is the ultimate victor. We hope that the authorities of China and Japan will take advantage of this urgent opportunity to review their mutual political power and further promote unity to cope with the serious situation.

Translated Commentary

### Mainland Operations and the Chinese People

According to the enemy's recent offensive trends, from Saipan to Iwo Jima, and the appearance of mobile units in the waters near Japan, it can be seen that there is a situation of landing on the Japanese mainland. According to the enemy's claim to launch a large-scale invasion of the Japanese homeland, it can be understood that Japan will sooner or later become a battlefield, so it is necessary to prepare for the worst. But it should be noted that even if the enemy wants to rush into the Japanese homeland in one breath, they will never give up their attempt to land in China. The enemy is indeed watching for opportunities to invade the Japanese homeland, but they are also preparing the objective conditions for mainland operations in China. This is the reality. It would be extremely dangerous to believe that the enemy will give up mainland landing operations in China and focus solely on the Japanese homeland, simply by observing the recent two or three phenomena. Even if the enemy dares to land on the Chinese coast, the intact state of the Japanese troops stationed in China, coupled with the strategic deployment that has long been completed in anticipation and the intensified training, will not allow the enemy to act rashly. The enemy's combat method is very different from the past. Now they are using large numbers of troops and huge amounts of weapons to land, which will present Japan with extreme difficulties. Even if the enemy can land somewhere on the long Chinese coastline and transport a large number of soldiers, they are likely to be annihilated before they can establish contact with the Chongqing army. Even if they can, as they wish, land a considerable force and establish contact with the Chongqing army, the mainland war cannot be resolved quickly, it will definitely be a long war of attrition. Therefore, if a decisive battle is launched on the mainland, it will definitely cause great damage to the Chinese people. But the Chongqing regime is gloating and extremely welcoming of the American landing operation, urging the United States to realize it in the shortest possible time. This is truly a criminal act that disregards the interests of its own people.

As mentioned above, even if the enemy dares to carry out a landing operation in China, if they cannot establish contact with the Chongqing army and if they cannot win the support of the Chinese people, they cannot conduct a large-scale and long-term war. In other words, mainland operations are the most intense military war, and at the same time, it is also a political war and ideological war to win over the Chinese people. Although this was the case in the past, it is now becoming clearer and more widespread due to the urgency of the war situation. In this regard, Japan needs to re-evaluate its past policies and should always carefully consider how to make the Chinese people thoroughly understand the meaning of the Greater East Asia War, and how to make the Chinese people understand that directly or indirectly assisting the Japanese army is a prerequisite for seeking the true liberation and welfare of the Chinese people. Japan, which has raised morality as a war goal, should have more favorable conditions than the enemy in this war. But in order to truly win over the Chinese people, Japan must reflect on its past policies and implement various new and decisive measures. Now there are some people who, on the pretext of the urgency of the war situation, want to abandon China's various political and ideological measures. This is a big mistake. They use the pretext of military first, and that operational needs are above all else, to narrowly distort the meaning of military and operational needs, and ignore that grasping the Chinese people is no less important than military warfare. These people are also raising the moral war goals of Japan, but they are defeatists and escapists who do not want to win the support of the Chinese people, which is definitely not an attitude that a confident person should take. At a time when China is about to turn into a major battlefield, we Japanese should thoroughly and seriously discuss, based on reality, how to unite the Chinese people around us.

### Entertainment Venues Given Grace Period for Business Hours

The municipal authorities had previously restricted the business hours of entertainment venues in order to adapt to the wartime system, stipulating that they must close at 10:00 PM every night. It is now learned that since the implementation of this decree, the business of various entertainment venues has been depressed, and it has been difficult to maintain operations. They have repeatedly requested the authorities to consider their business difficulties and grant them a grace period. The Municipal Police Bureau, in view of the fact that spring has arrived and summer is approaching, with longer days and shorter nights, believes that it is possible to grant a grace period for the business hours of entertainment venues. Therefore, after careful consideration and passage through the Bureau Affairs Meeting, it has been decided to temporarily extend the business hours of entertainment venues until 11:30 PM every night from April 1st to October 30th. However, electric lights can only be used until 10:00 PM, and other kerosene lamps should be used after 10:00 PM to save electricity.

### Post Office to Issue Capital Relocation Commemorative Stamps Starting Tomorrow

On the first day of issue, only complete sets can be purchased, after which they will be supplied as usual. It is also heard that each post office will have commemorative postmarks available on the 30th, ready to cancel items on the spot as needed by customers.

### Goods for Sale Must Be Marked with Prices

The Municipal Economic Bureau has repeatedly ordered that all retail stores in the city must attach labels to all goods sold, clearly marking the prices. It has recently reiterated its previous order. From now on, all stores must attach labels to all goods sold, clearly marking the prices, and affix the approved price list in a prominent place in the store. Anyone who violates this will be punished the first time and closed down the second time, without any leniency.

### More Than Seventy Illegal Cooking Oil Merchants Arrested; Currently Under Strict Investigation

Recently, the black market for cooking oil in the city has become increasingly rampant, with prices differing from the set price by as much as double, and there have been cases of hoarding and refusing to retail. The Municipal Economic Police authorities, based on repeated secret reports, discovered that some illegal oil merchants and oil grain [unclear], were actually conducting black market illegal transactions and arbitrarily raising prices in the area of Datong Road and Tiantai Road, disrupting the market. Therefore, at noon on the 28th, a large number of officers were dispatched to the area, and more than seventy illegal oil merchants [unclear] and suspects were apprehended on the spot. They are currently under strict investigation.

### Material Review Efforts to Simplify

In the past, when the Commercial Control Association and the five control associations below it encountered important material review and material transfer matters, they would first submit them to the Executive Yuan for review by the Material Review Committee. If it was deemed that further investigation or decision was required, it would be sent to the Shanghai Office of the Committee to liaise and meet with the Commercial Control Association or the various control associations. Moreover, the Ministry of Industry and Commerce had to assign a high-ranking official to come to Shanghai, which was inconvenient for the exchange of official documents and review time. Recently, Chairman Zhou and Secretary-General Chen of the Material Review Committee decided and instructed the Shanghai Office to handle matters in accordance with the following methods: If the Commercial Control Association has important cases, it may instruct the Shanghai Office of the Material Review Committee to convene a liaison meeting of the Commercial Control Association and the five control associations, and the office will send a representative from the Ministry of Industry and Commerce to attend the meeting. After a formal decision is made, the office will submit it to the Material Review Committee. At the same time, the Commercial Control Association will also submit the official documents to the Shanghai Vehicle Affairs Office to the Executive Yuan for review by the Review Committee. Upon receiving the decision documents from the Shanghai Office, the Review Committee will immediately review and reply to the Executive Yuan. If the case does not require convening a liaison meeting, the Shanghai Office may decide to submit it to the Material Review Committee for record.

### Municipal Government Revises the Structure of the Baojia Association

The Municipal Government believes that the structure of the Baojia Committee of this city and the Baojia Offices of the various subordinate counties is too large and does not meet actual needs. In order to simplify administration and achieve practical results, the organizational regulations of the committee and the organizational rules of the Baojia Offices of the various counties have been revised. The Municipal Baojia Committee has been ordered to comply, and the Ministry of Interior has been notified for record.

### Police Bureau Arrests Leader of Pickpocket Gang

The crime prevention section of the third division of the Municipal Police Bureau, due to the rampant activity of a large number of pickpocket gangs in streetcars in various districts of the city, specially dispatched detectives to investigate and arrest Xu Matang (also known as Daqingzi), the leader of the pickpocket gang, and his accomplice Zhang Zhiyao. It was also discovered that Xu's gang had more than a dozen members who specialized in picking pockets on the French Concession streetcar line along Jinling Road Bund, Dongxin Street, and Luli Road. They had been arrested seventeen times. The suspect and his accomplice Peng Zhiyao were transferred to the vagrant labor camp for custody and rehabilitation. At the same time, the search for gang members will continue in order to completely eliminate them in one fell swoop.

### Psychological Construction and National Construction: Secretary-General Luo of the Municipal Government's Radio Address

The 30th marks the fifth anniversary of the National Government's return to the capital. At the request of the Propaganda Department, Secretary-General Luo of the Municipal Government delivered a national radio address at 8:20 PM on the 28th, titled "Psychological Construction and National Construction." The address lasted for twenty minutes. The original text is as follows:

Two Means, One Goal

National construction is difficult; building a modern nation is especially difficult. Five years have passed since the National Government returned to Nanjing. After five years of effort, full peace has yet to be achieved. This is naturally a matter of great regret to every comrade who advocates peace. However, in these five years, the abolition of unequal treaties, a century-long aspiration of the Chinese people, and the recovery of concessions have been realized one by one. This means that the most important parts of Sun Yat-sen's will are being realized. As we approach the fifth anniversary of the National Government's return to the capital, the late Chairman Wang has passed away, but Acting Chairman Chen inherits the late Chairman Wang's aspirations and leads us to continue moving forward. We will, of course, remain true to our original intention of serving the country and the nation with utmost dedication and strive forward in unison. Since the return to the capital, the late Chairman Wang has declared to China and the world the three major principles of "Peace," "Anti-Communism," and "National Construction." Peace is used to strive for China's freedom, anti-communism to achieve China's unification, and national construction to consolidate China's independence. It can also be said that peace and anti-communism are two necessary means, while national construction is the ultimate goal. By national construction, we mean, of course, to make China a modern nation, standing independently in the world.

Psychological Construction Must Be Completed

Since we are to make China a modern nation, looking back at the political and social realities of the past five years, we dare not deceive ourselves into thinking that we are satisfied. The communist bandits are still rampant, the people's livelihood is still so dire, corruption and malpractice have not been completely eradicated, and public opinion has still not been promptly conveyed. The reasons for these phenomena are still very complex. I believe that the most significant factor is the lack or weakness of a national construction mindset. After decades of advocating revolution, Sun Yat-sen retired and personally formulated the Outline of National Construction, lamenting the mistakes in the thinking of the revolutionaries, which hindered national construction and hampered the completion of the revolution. He resolutely made psychological construction the opening chapter of the Outline of National Construction. Reflecting on the present and thinking about the past, and recalling Sun Yat-sen's teachings, we deeply feel that psychological construction is the source and driving force of national construction. Without the completion of psychological construction, we can never cultivate healthy citizens, nor can we produce rational politics. In the case of Shanghai at this time and place, the domains poisoned and enslaved by the colonial policies of British and American imperialists for a century have resulted in a deformed society, and the psychology of the majority of citizens is inevitably deformed. This time, when I came to Shanghai with Mr. Zhou to take on local administrative work, Mr. Zhou told the citizens two sentences: "Society comes before the individual, and public interest outweighs private gain." The slogan I put forward is: "Make Shanghai a Chinese Shanghai." These are our basic requirements for psychological construction. For many days, the people of Shanghai have had the shadow of American troops landing in their minds. Some secretly rejoiced, some felt panicked, some tried to avoid it, and some wanted to take advantage of the situation. In short, they all start from a selfish point of view, forming various deformed mentalities.

Thoroughly Transform Deformed Mentalities

Shanghai was originally a paradise for adventurers, and Shanghai was originally a famous city of rumors. Deformed people and deformed mentalities create all kinds of deformed phenomena. I believe that it is necessary to take drastic measures to thoroughly transform them. Recently, I have heard many examples that demonstrate the deformed psychology of Shanghai people. Let me cite a couple of examples as proof: The owner of a certain shoe store told his clerk that he might as well sell all the imported shoes currently in the store at a low price. He said that the British and Americans would come soon and would surely bring many new styles and new goods, so shouldn't these old-fashioned stocks be cleared out as soon as possible? Also, some silk merchants, even when the price of silk was falling, were still unwilling to sell their stocks. Their reason was that silk is a very good export commodity for international trade, and they are waiting for their good days to come. I am afraid that there are not a few people who hold this kind of shallow, childish, and selfish view. War is sacred, and the nations participating in the war, and the citizens who obey the nation and engage in combat, must have a sacred sense of responsibility. The progress of the war is determined by the war leaders based on the requirements and application of strategy and policy. We cannot prove whether there is any war god in the dark, but I believe that the war god is just a messenger of the war leaders. Unfortunately, China has, on the one hand, the anti-Japanese camp under the British and American banner, and on the other hand, a participating group that is working with Japan. As citizens, they can lean to the left or the right according to their own will, and the authorities should not force them. However, taking the attitude of a third party, not fulfilling obligations, not taking responsibility, talking cynically, and only secretly doing selfish and self-serving things, that is the role of non-citizens, and this is not acceptable. Now that the god of war has descended upon us, escape is impossible, waiting for death is useless. Stand up, take responsibility, arm yourselves, and practice self-defense. This is the first priority.

Inspire the Public's Sense of Responsibility

Let us look at the Japanese garrison on Iwo Jima, who fought to the last man and perished together with a spirit that surpassed victory. This is because they shared a sacred sense of responsibility of loyalty to the emperor and love for the country. National construction is difficult; building a modern nation is especially difficult. Today is the eve of the 72nd anniversary of the martyrdom of the martyrs of our Chinese Kuomintang. Recalling the heroic spirit of the martyrs who sacrificed their lives for righteousness, and reflecting on everyone's struggle in hardship, we deeply feel that the revolution has not yet succeeded, and national construction still requires effort. Those who survive are truly bound by limitless responsibility. We are determined to revive our country on this land and in these ruins. We must first cultivate a national construction mindset and inspire everyone's sacred sense of responsibility. This is the first lesson of psychological construction. Psychological construction increases by one point, and national construction succeeds by one point.
