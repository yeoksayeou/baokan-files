### Japanese Special Attack Forces Attack Day and Night; Fiercely Assault Enemy Mobile Units; US Authorities Admit Severe Damage

Tokyo, 22nd (Central News Agency) – To compensate for the lack of air power around Okinawa, the enemy Americans are focusing all their efforts on strengthening land-based aircraft at the northern and central airfields on Okinawa Island and reinforcing facilities on the surrounding islands of Okinawa Island, such as Kerama Islands, Tsuken Island, Kamiyama, Mizuna Island, and Ie Island. Enemy warships off Okinawa Island continue their stubborn and foolish movements, firing naval guns. Since the 19th, the enemy forces have shifted to an all-out offensive, continuing their forceful advance, aiming for the island chain, and are continuing to eliminate enemy carrier-based aircraft. On the night of the 21st, they captured a powerful enemy mobile unit southeast of the main island and launched a fierce attack. On the 20th and 21st, they continued to attack the northern and central airfields on the main island, thwarting the enemy's plans. Such fierce attacks by the Japanese army have caused the frontline enemy soldiers to lose their courage and be filled with terror. According to a broadcast by Manro Bauroen on the 12th, the suicidal special attacks of the Japanese army have turned American and Australian soldiers into neurasthenics, frankly admitting the fierce attacks of the Japanese army. The American Secretary of the Navy, Lamorse, also stated that the US Navy was surrounded by several layers of Japanese special attack forces and could not break through the encirclement without incurring cruel and significant sacrifices, expressing fear of the Japanese special attack forces and issuing cries of despair. The US authorities have been concealing the existence of the Japanese special attack forces and the severe damage they have caused, but now they can no longer hide it and are gradually admitting it, which is particularly noteworthy. According to a Washington AP dispatch, casualties among the US forces in the Okinawa operation so far show that naval casualties exceed those of the army for the first time. The fierce attacks by the Japanese special attack forces have inflicted great damage on enemy warships. The damage inflicted on the enemy by such fierce attacks by Japanese attack forces is increasing dramatically, further terrifying the enemy.

### Kamikaze Squads Rush to Sink Enemy Cruisers

Naval Base, 22nd (Central News Agency) – The members of the Kamikaze special attack squads here are in high spirits, vowing to annihilate the enemy. Their remarkable achievements have terrified the enemy. Lieutenant Commander Yuji Kuribayashi's squad, which received orders to sortie on the 6th, directed all its aircraft to attack enemy warships in Nakagusuku Bay on Okinawa Island. At a certain time, the third aircraft of Kuribayashi's squad radioed the command post: "One enemy cruiser has been sunk by our forces." Then, the fourth aircraft also reported sinking one. The command post erupted in cheers. In an instant, Commander Kuribayashi radioed that an enemy large transport ship had been sunk, and the command post was even more delighted. Another small squad led by Lieutenant Kazuo Matsushita also used accurate and courageous torpedo attacks, sinking an enemy cruiser off the eastern coast of Okinawa Island. He then leisurely returned to his base with his fellow aircraft. According to Lieutenant Matsushita, regarding the heroic sortie of the torpedo plane, "As we approached Okinawa Island, it began to drizzle, so we quickly descended and plunged into the decisive battle. A certain number of nautical miles from Okinawa, we spotted an enemy patrol boat, which immediately bombarded our aircraft with anti-aircraft fire. In order to avoid the bullets, I flew up and down, thinking that the enemy was truly fierce. The enemy then shone a searchlight directly on our aircraft, adding to the artillery fire. I carelessly took a bullet in my right hand and was injured, but I endured the pain and continued to fly forward. Just then, I suddenly spotted an enemy cruiser, and its course was still clearly discernible, which could be called divine assistance. With a determination to die, I immediately launched a torpedo. In an instant, a small white column shot straight into the air from the southeast, hitting its stern. It sank into the sea in an instant."

### Enemy Forces Launch Wave-like Attacks on Okinawa Island

Tokyo, 22nd (Central News Agency) – Since the morning of the 19th, enemy forces in the northern district of southern Okinawa Island have launched an all-out offensive with a force of approximately 10,000 troops. On the 21st, they continued to attack on all fronts under the cover of intense artillery fire, launching wave-like attacks with tanks and powerful units. The enemy's main attack focus has shifted to the west coast. Japanese frontline troops attacked enemy camps at night, repelling them, and are still securing the frontline positions south of Tsushima, north of Iruku, and north of Kashiki, fighting valiantly. Meanwhile, Japanese air units around Okinawa Island carried out daring attacks from the night of the 20th to dawn on the 21st. The additional confirmed battle results are that at 9:30 PM on the 20th, there were nine columns of fire around the Kerama Islands, and at 1:00 AM on the 21st, there were seven columns of fire off Kadena.

Naval Base, 22nd (Central News Agency) – Since the 19th, enemy warship groups have approached the Minatogawa area in southern Okinawa Island, attempting to land. The elite Japanese forces repelled them at the coast, and their morale is high. Although they have repeatedly punished the enemy and inflicted great damage, the enemy stubbornly attacked the west coast again from the morning of the 20th. The Japanese army is using a tactic of luring the enemy while reorganizing the battle lines. Currently, the war stretches from the Mekama Makiminato area to the Kakazu Nishihara Heights, and both sides are facing off. The Japanese army's counterattack is currently extremely fierce.

Lisbon, 21st (Central News Agency) – Regarding the Okinawa battle situation, according to frontline base news, the US military has deployed the 2nd Division on the west coast, the 7th Division on the east coast, and the 96th Division in the center, attempting to advance south simultaneously. Their desire to advance on the Naha area and its two airfields is even stronger, but due to Japanese resistance, the battle situation is not progressing smoothly. The 96th Division is currently facing the most intense Japanese resistance.

### Air Raids on the Japanese Tokai Region Cause Extremely Minor Damage; Kyushu and Taipei Also Attacked

Tokyo, 22nd (Central News Agency) – Approximately 40 P-51 fighter planes from Iwo Jima, guided by B-29 aircraft, raided the Japanese Tokai region from 11:00 AM on the 22nd, strafing factories and other facilities.

Another part, about 30 aircraft, passed Cape Ashizuri and circled over the western Shikoku region, then invaded the Oita region for about three hours, carrying out attacks and bombings. Apart from some fires, the Japanese side sustained very minor damage. However, a portion of the 30 enemy aircraft that attacked the northern Kyushu Oita region detoured through the Miyazaki region near Cape Toi and then retreated. In addition, approximately 30 enemy carrier-based aircraft simultaneously invaded Kagoshima Prefecture from the Satsuma Peninsula, circled over the northern region and the southern part of Kumamoto Prefecture, and then retreated unexpectedly.

Taipei, 22nd (Central News Agency) – On the night of the 20th, several enemy bombers invaded Taipei City, dropping several incendiary bombs, and retreated at 2:30 AM.

Editorial

### Crushing Enemy Propaganda

The focus of the current Pacific War situation is the battle for Okinawa Island. Observing the enemy's recent strategic intentions, the biggest goal of the enemy's US high command is to not only capture Berlin and resolve the European war by April 25th, but also to capture Okinawa and attempt to land on Kyushu, thereby simultaneously subduing Japan. Only when these two ambitions are fulfilled can the United States hold the reins of the Allied powers at the San Francisco Conference and become the leader of the postwar world organization. As for other anti-Axis countries, they are trying to capture Berlin before April 25th and then discuss the strategic focus of the East Asian war situation at the San Francisco Conference to deal with Japan. According to the current trend, the enemy Americans have to take a step back and abandon the fantasy of simultaneously resolving the eastern and western fronts, and instead follow the latter attempt. However, in order to show that they have the strength to win in East Asia, they will make some progress in East Asia before or during the San Francisco Conference, so that their future international position will not be suppressed by the Soviet Union. Of course, our ally Japan will never allow the enemy Americans to achieve this ambition today. Therefore, the battle centered on the Battle of Okinawa is proceeding intensely and is attracting worldwide attention.

The enemy Americans began invading the Ryukyu Islands from Iwo Jima on March 17th, evolving into the Battle of Okinawa. They have assembled a large number of landing craft and more than 300 warships for this battle. Their strategy is to massively bomb Japan's Kyushu and other places with air power to restrain the Japanese mainland air force from reinforcing the front, and to continuously bomb Taiwan and our country's coast to prevent and destroy transportation links between Japan and the mainland and Southeast Asia, and then advance their main naval force toward Okinawa Island. The enemy Americans' initial battle against the Japanese mainland has thus begun. Their ambition, of course, is not limited to the occupation of Okinawa Island or a few islands, but also to lure the entire Japanese navy to come out and strike a major blow.

However, the enemy's fantasy of a quick victory has been shattered by the counterattacks of the Japanese army, navy, and air force, especially the special attack forces. The war has lasted for more than a month, and not only is the enemy's attempt impossible to achieve, but on the contrary, six enemy divisions are trapped on the island and cannot be used to start battles in Kyushu or elsewhere. On the 18th of this month, the enemy Americans launched a general attack on Okinawa, as a struggle to gain face for the United States before the San Francisco Conference after Roosevelt's death, and it contains an even greater element of desperate adventure. The expansion of the scale of air raids on the Japanese mainland and the request for British cooperation fully prove its ambition.

The San Francisco Conference, which the anti-Axis side has been promoting for a long time, will be held soon. The enemy's entire conspiracy is on full display, and it is not far away. Today, the center of the enemy's propaganda is nothing more than first, after the end of the European war, European forces will be transferred to fight in Asia; second, after the San Francisco Conference, the Soviet Union's attitude towards the East Asian war will change; and third, when the entire new international situation unfolds, the anti-Axis alliance will deal with Japan. However, we observe the current reality, and the enemy's attempt is, after all, just a propaganda strategy and will not have a decisive effect. At the same time, we can only unite the total power of the 1 billion people of East Asia to crush the enemy's propaganda strategy.

### Weekly War Situation in Various Parts of East Asia

Tokyo, 22nd (Central News Agency) – The weekly war situation in Greater East Asia is as follows:

Okinawa Front: The land battle situation on Okinawa Island remains fierce. In the past thirteen days, the enemy has not been able to advance a single step and is in a stalemate. To break this situation, the enemy is attempting to seize the northern and central airfields and the airfield on the Kerama Islands to advance to the northern part of Okinawa Island. At the same time, they landed on Kamiyama Island, Tsuken Island, and the satellite island of Ie, and landed on Minna Island on the 16th, taking an encirclement approach to the main Japanese positions in the south. Also, in order to cover the landing forces, they continuously fired from ships, with more than 550 enemy carrier-based aircraft attacking various island bases around the 17th, about 350 on the 18th, and about 650 on the 19th. After the 17th, B-24 and P-40 land-based aircraft participated in the attack on Japanese bases on Okinawa and nearby islands, indicating that the enemy has begun to use land-based bases in that area. Also, enemy aircraft in groups of 20 to 30 are often in the skies above the Japanese positions in the south to assist in land operations. The Japanese Kamikaze special attack forces and other air units brave adverse weather, sortie day and night, and fiercely attack enemy mobile units, ships around the island, and land units, sinking and destroying more than 400 enemy ships. The enemy is still reorganizing the remnants and holding on to the landing forces and supply lines. On the 15th and 16th, about 100 carrier-based aircraft raided southern Kyushu, but the scale was very small, which shows that the enemy mobile units have suffered greatly from Japanese attacks. To replenish the mobile units, B-29 aircraft were transferred from the Mariana Islands to the Kyushu area, and P-51 aircraft were transferred from Iwo Jima, specializing in strategic bombing. Today, the air power of both sides in the Ryukyu Islands remains evenly matched, and the outcome of the war will be dominated by the consumption of aircraft.

Mariana Islands: In the Mariana Islands, B-29, P-51, and other enemy aircraft have been shifted to the Kyushu area from Wednesday to assist in direct operations and to supplement the deficiency in air power. Especially the attacks by P-51 aircraft prove that the enemy's preparations on Iwo Jima have gradually been completed. These small aircraft cannot cause large-scale destruction, but in the future they may disrupt the Japanese rear and hinder production. In addition, the B-17, B-24, P-38, and other medium and small aircraft that the enemy has used in Europe are now also planned to be used in East Asia. It is reported that the enemy has stopped manufacturing B-29 and B-32 large aircraft and has begun to issue these types of medium and small aircraft.

Philippines: Enemy ship movements in the Philippine Sea are gradually becoming active. After the middle of the month, a small number of enemy troops landed on Talisay Island in Mindanao. Also, on the west coast of the island, in the Cotabato area, the enemy mobilized battleships and cruisers, opened fire, and then dispatched powerful units to land. Fierce battles are currently underway. On Luzon, the morale of the Japanese troops in various places is high, causing the enemy to bleed heavily. The current fierce battles are taking place in the mountainous area west of Baguio, and there are also fierce battles around Laguna de Bay.

Southwest Pacific: Enemy air raids have become rare. In the Balikpapan and Tarakan areas on the east coast of Borneo, there are still a small number of enemy aircraft raids.

Burma: In northern Burma, the Japanese army is reorganizing its forces near Mount Kamaing and has come into contact with the enemy forces advancing south. Also, in central Burma, on the 17th, the enemy mobilized 100 tanks and invaded the area near Schwedaung, about 80 kilometers south of Meiktila. The enemy at Kokeoman, about 60 kilometers west of Meiktila, also launched an offensive on the same day. The Japanese army is engaging them in battle.

Indian Ocean: In the Indian Ocean, on the 14th, British mobile units raided Nias Island west of Sumatra and engaged the Japanese garrison in battle. The strength of the enemy's attack this time was very weak.

### America's Distress (3)

— Tadahisa Matsudaira

Truman will likely not experience much change in the short term, but it is easy to imagine that difficult issues from various sides will arise in succession after a considerable period of time.

### Heavy Difficulties in Diplomacy and Military Affairs

The first major issue is probably diplomacy. In the past, American foreign policy was decided by the president alone, treating Stimson like a foreign secretary. However, Truman has never experienced the diplomatic arena. He was incoherent when he met with Churchill and Stalin before, only speaking about irrelevant matters. I am afraid that the ambassadors from various countries in Washington will not respect him either. Therefore, American diplomacy will only decline in the future, and the power of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee will be strengthened. The president's position in diplomacy will inevitably plummet, and America's national prestige will undoubtedly decline.

Secondly, he cannot control the army and navy, which will cause a lack of unity between the government and the military. The American president is the commander-in-chief of the army and navy, and generals such as Stimson, Forrestal, King, Eisenhower, Nimitz, and MacArthur were all under his command. Roosevelt served as Assistant Secretary of the Navy during World War I, and his ability and political experience were enough to make these army and navy generals willingly obey him. But what about Truman? He only became an army captain during World War I, and his qualifications are very shallow. Of course, he is not respected by the generals. Truman has only the empty title of president, and his position is higher than theirs. Because of this, the military and the government cannot coordinate, and the army and navy may also lose their coordination.

### Congress is the Most Difficult to Deal With

Regarding domestic unity in the United States, I am also worried for them. Able cabinet members such as Wallace, Morgenthau, and Ickes, whether in terms of their party experience or their abilities, are beyond Truman's reach. Especially Wallace, who was the vice president before, is he willing to agree to everything and submit to Truman? According to foreign news reports, many members of the cabinet have decided to resign, and from my point of view, this is inevitable. Because no matter how much you want to contribute to the country, who wants to be instructed by a Missourian hick? Therefore, I expect internal rifts to occur. Observing this, Truman finds that the most difficult thing to deal with is probably Congress. As mentioned above, Congress can restrain the president's powers. If there is a capable president, Congress can tolerate the president's dictatorial power, but for such a mediocre president, of course, he cannot be given such strong dictatorial power. Even if Truman wants to announce wartime laws to make operations run more smoothly, Congress will not grant him this power because of his insufficient ability. Also, Congress will reject and not pass the various important policies implemented by the president at any time. But I think Truman, in order to avoid friction with Congress and avoid trouble, will extremely respect the opinions of Congress and adopt a soft, indecisive attitude, gradually fading the wartime political color of the United States.

### Truman is Bound to Fail

Foreign news dispatches have made the following criticism: The final difficulty that Truman encounters is the difficulty of reconciling the two matters of ensuring national livelihood and replenishing military needs. The lives of the American people have become unbearable. Due to labor shortages, malignant inflation is becoming increasingly serious, transportation capacity is lacking, and essential living supplies are severely depleted. The lives of the people are heavily threatened. Although they have increased the full amount of the allowance for the families of fallen soldiers, the social unrest has reached a point where it cannot be concealed. In order to alleviate this situation, the government hopes that the European war will end soon and assures the people that it will increase civilian supplies. It has decided to convert one-third of the army's military industry to civilian industry after the war, but whether it can be realized is a big question. According to Eisenhower, the commander of the anti-Axis forces on the Western Front, the war against Germany has gradually turned into a guerrilla war, so the future of the war does not allow us to be optimistic. It will take a considerable amount of time to eliminate this guerrilla war, so the American army and navy still hope to continue to supply weapons, bullets, ships, and aircraft. The government's statement that military factories will be restored to civilian factories is ultimately difficult. Roosevelt also went through many twists and turns for this problem, and the director of the wartime production bureau, Nelson, also resigned because the matter could not be resolved. Can today's Truman withstand it? (The End)

### Premier Chen Talks About Making Decisions Based on the Opinions of the Majority of the People, Weighing the Urgency, and Implementing Things in Order

Nanjing, 22nd (Central News Agency) – Since the Wartime People's Representative Conference of various provinces and cities was enthusiastically held in Beijing on March 28th, the people of the country have risen up and universally launched the National Salvation Movement, fully expressing the people's spontaneous awareness of their love for the country. On the 21st, various parts of the country held National Salvation Movement People's Congresses, and the enthusiasm was extremely high. President Chen of the National Government specially issued the following statement on this matter: Yesterday, the people of various provinces and cities held National Salvation Movement People's Congresses to support the resolutions of the Representative Congress on the 28th of last month, which shows the enthusiasm of the people of the country and the value of the representative resolutions. Among them, matters such as anti-communism, strengthening self-defense, forming a people's representative body, guaranteeing freedom of speech, circulating materials, and stabilizing livelihood are particularly urgent and are also the beginning of national policy. At the beginning of the return to the capital, anti-communism and peace have long become iron laws. The implementation of constitutional government has already established a special committee to start planning. Guaranteeing freedom of speech is not a problem. The circulation of materials is not yet satisfactory due to the wartime situation, but the competent authorities are constantly adjusting it, and the results are gradually becoming apparent. All of this is of great concern to the government. Now that the expectations of the people have been established, the measures in the future will be easier. We must know that the people are the foundation of the country. The government will do its best to meet the opinions of the majority of the people. We must supervise the environment, weigh the urgency, and have the central government evaluate the plans and proceed in order.

### US Navy Casualties Are Now Close to 100,000

Lisbon, 12th (Central News Agency) – According to a Washington dispatch: The US Navy Department announced on the 21st that the total number of US Navy personnel and coastal guards lost since the beginning of the war is 98,830.

### The San Francisco Conference Approaches: Britain and America Form a United Front

Lisbon, April 22nd, Central News Agency dispatch from Washington: Prior to Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov's arrival in Washington, British Foreign Secretary Eden met with U.S. Secretary of State Stettinius on the 21st, focusing on the Polish question and exchanging various opinions. After the meeting, Eden declared that Britain and America were in complete agreement on all issues. From this, it is clear that Eden and Stettinius have already formed a united front to counter Molotov's intentions. Representatives of other anti-Axis nations have departed for San Francisco. U.S. President Truman has decided to deliver a ten-minute broadcast speech from the White House before the San Francisco Conference.

Lisbon, April 21st, Central News Agency dispatch from Washington: U.S. representative to the San Francisco Conference, Hull, informed Secretary of State Stettinius on the 21st that he would be unable to attend the conference due to illness, but intends to participate in the latter half of the conference if his health recovers.

### Indian Delegation Arrives in Canada

Lisbon, April 22nd, Reuters dispatch from Canada: The sixteen-member Indian delegation to the San Francisco Conference arrived in Montreal yesterday by plane.

Stockholm, April 22nd, Central News Agency dispatch: Undersecretary of State for India, Listowel, delivered a speech yesterday at the Peterboro Indian Youth Conference, demanding that the political power of India be returned to the Indian people as soon as possible. He stated that unnecessary delays would poison the future relationship between Britain and India.

### Soviet-Polish Sign Treaty of Friendship and Mutual Assistance

Stockholm, April 22nd, Central News Agency dispatch from Moscow: The Soviet government and the Polish Provisional Government signed a treaty of friendship and mutual assistance last night in Moscow. Although the content has not yet been published, it is generally expected to be similar to the treaties signed by the United States, France, Czechoslovakia, and Yugoslavia.

### Rumor that Stalin is Personally Directing Operations at the Front Lines: Soviet Forces Reach the Northeastern Suburbs of Berlin

Zurich, April 21st, Central News Agency dispatch quoting a Reuters reporter on the 21st: Marshal Stalin is now personally directing Soviet forces operating on the Berlin front from a field headquarters. The First Belorussian Army and the First Ukrainian Army have practically merged into a central army group. The reporter believes that Stalin's appearance at the front lines is due to the impending meeting of Soviet forces with the anti-Axis armies on the Western Front.  Complex and delicate issues will arise after the meeting, hence his personal presence at the front to handle everything.

Berlin, April 22nd, Central News Agency dispatch: Reuters dispatch: Soviet forces are attempting to encircle Berlin, with their flanks gradually closing in on the German capital. In the northeast, east, and south of the city, Soviet vanguard units have reached the suburbs of Berlin: Bernau, Strasburg, Fürstenwalde, Königs Wusterhausen, and Zossen. The German army is putting up fierce defensive battles against the numerically superior Soviet forces, with Soviet progress being minimal. The Soviet army is no longer attempting direct frontal assaults, but is focusing on its flanks. The German front lines east and northeast of Berlin are sufficient to withstand Soviet breakthrough attempts, but are forced to retreat closer to Berlin.

### Call for Paintings for the Marine Art Exhibition

As the Greater East Asia War intensifies, the solidarity of the various peoples of Greater East Asia is growing stronger, especially the close ties between China and Japan in military, political, and economic aspects, which are truly worthy of celebration. The Shanghai Branch of the China News Association, with the support of the Japanese Fleet Information Department and the sponsorship of the International Cultural Promotion Association, will host the Shanghai Marine Art Exhibition, which will open on the 40th anniversary of the Imperial Japanese Navy.

### Germany Absolutely Will Not Agree to Unconditional Surrender: The European War May Not End Soon

Lisbon, April 21st, Central News Agency dispatch from Paris: Chief of Staff of the Supreme Headquarters of the Anti-Axis Forces in Europe, Smith, met with a group of reporters on the 21st and made the following statement: Although the German army has lost its organized resistance, it can still hold onto mountainous areas and is determined to fight to the end. Therefore, the war may not end soon. The anti-Axis forces should be even more aware of the harshness and enormous losses of the war ahead. It would be a great mistake to regard the cooperation between the US and Soviet forces as the end of the European war. Germany will absolutely not agree to unconditional surrender even at the final moment.

### A Glimpse of Wartime Berlin

Berlin, April 22nd, Central News Agency dispatch: Reuters dispatch: Berlin heard the sounds of artillery fire yesterday, the first time in a hundred years, especially intense in the eastern suburbs of Berlin, shaking doors and windows. Berlin was still in a normal state at noon on Friday. After the morning air raid alert, citizens went to their respective professions, but the scene had completely changed.

In addition, the U.S. Third Army occupied Asch, and the U.S. Seventh Army and French First Army successfully encircled Stuttgart completely on the 21st. The Southern French army has occupied Donaueschingen, 50 kilometers east of Freiburg, and reached a tributary of the Danube.

Nanjing

### Overview of the Capital's Financial Industry

— By Ren Ping

### Emerging Like Bamboo Shoots after Rain

It is strange that in Nanjing, the financial industry, in recent years of extreme economic fatigue, new banks and money shops have sprung up one after another. Banks and money shops, in theory, should bear the mission of supporting industry and commerce and regulating the social economy, but in recent years, it is doubtful whether the Nanjing banking and money shop industries, which have sprung up like bamboo shoots after rain, have made any contribution to the above-mentioned mission.

The concentration of banks and money shops in the capital is in the triangle area of Zhonghua Road, Jiankang Road, and Zhuque Road. The sight of one every three or four steps is eye-catching, and it is common to see money shops being converted into banks, with brand-new high-rise buildings rising up.

According to current statistics, in addition to one national bank, there are currently 56 banks and 117 money shops and pawn shops. At the same time, there are still ongoing preparations for opening new ones; although the financial authorities have long restricted the issuance of licenses, in reality, the devil always outsmarts the saint. Observing the content and business of these small banks and small money shops, most are bleak and pitiful, and the so-called golden age is long gone.

### Implementing Strengthening of Finance

The direct administrative body for the banking and money shop industries is the Nanjing branch of the Central Financial Affairs Inspection Office. In November of last year, it was ordered to strengthen the financial industry and promulgated the "Outline for Strengthening the Operations of Financial Institutions" to rectify general unsound financial institutions, and limited all banks and money shops to increase their capital or merge within three months. The minimum capital of each bank was increased from 6 million yuan to 10 million yuan, with 5 million yuan actually paid up. The minimum capital of money shops was increased from 4 million yuan to 6 million yuan, with half actually paid up. Currently, the bank with the highest capital is the Huaxing Commercial Bank, with an actual paid-up capital of 50 million yuan; while there are still several banks whose minimum actual paid-up capital is less than the stipulated 3 million yuan.

The strengthening work began on February 22 of this year, and restrictions were placed on loans. Loans to individuals must not exceed 200,000 yuan, and loans to companies, businesses, and factories must not exceed 2 million yuan. Loans exceeding 2 million yuan must be applied for approval before they can be issued. On the other hand, emphasis is placed on filling out various forms and reports, with more than 20 types of daily or monthly reports on loans and deposits of various types.

As for deposit reserve funds, they are still handled according to past methods, stipulating 10% for current accounts and 5% for fixed deposits, which are paid to the Central Bank. The deposit is based on the total amount of deposits in each bank and money shop each day, as the sole guarantee for depositors.

### Establishing Preparation Libraries

The banking and money shop industries each have their own collective organizations, with industry associations. Ge Liang is responsible for convening the Banking Industry Association, and Tang Shaoheng is responsible for the Money Shop Industry Association.

Recently, in order to develop finance and regulate inter-bank lending, the banking and money shop industries have also formed a Banking Industry Joint Reserve Library and a Money Shop Industry Joint Reserve Library. Fifty-one units participated in the Banking Industry Joint Reserve Library, each paying a reserve fund of 250,000 yuan, and borrowing 20 million yuan from the Central Reserve Bank. The banking and money shop industries also have a check clearing house in the Central Reserve Bank. Every afternoon, members are sent by the banks and money shops to exchange checks.

### Restrictions on Store Mortgages

The pawn of goods is also a major event for the banking and money shop industries. In order to achieve effective price management, the Nanjing Municipal Government promulgated "Measures for the Pledge of Goods", ordering the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and various industry associations to restrict the goods pledged by stores to banks and money shops to no more than seven-tenths of the collateral. However, it is permissible to first accept the pledge and then, on the next day, submit a list of store names, types and quantities of collateral, current value, and amount of the pledge to the Municipal Government for review. If pledges are made privately without reporting or exceeding the prescribed amount, strict penalties will be imposed if discovered.

As far as the current number of financial institutions in Nanjing is concerned, it has exceeded the actual demand. There are too many that are crude and shoddy, especially many fragile small banks and money shops. It can be said that there are very few legitimate businesses such as remittance, deposit, lending, and mortgage. Most of them are a pretext for engaging in some illegal operations such as speculative activities, in order to maintain expenses. As for investment in general agriculture and industry, they all feel that they are unable to do so, so it is inevitable that capital turnover will be stretched.

### News Association Held a Current Affairs Lecture Yesterday: Students from Major Middle Schools Attended Enthusiastically

In order to enable the general public of this city to have a deep understanding of the current situation at a time when the world war is becoming increasingly fierce, the Shanghai Branch of the China News Association held a current affairs lecture at the Dahua Theater yesterday (the 22nd) morning at 10:00 AM. Students from major middle schools in the city were invited to attend. Yang Guangzheng, editor of the "Shen Bao Monthly," was invited to give the lecture. More than 1,000 students from various schools in the city attended the lecture.

The lecture began on time with a speech by Chairman Lu Wanyi who said: "Today, when the world is in extraordinary turmoil, the Pacific War has approached the Japanese mainland and China, and Europe has reached the decisive stage. In view of the seriousness of the situation, the Association has specially held this current affairs lecture with three aims: 1. To promote the accurate understanding of news by citizens. 2. To promote wartime emotions and enhance work efficiency among citizens. 3. To awaken intellectuals in key positions to jointly shoulder the mission of uniting and saving the country."

This work has now been completed, and it is beginning to prepare a statistical table of the status of the trade associations and submit a report as follows: The Investigation Department investigated the status of the trade associations, prepared and distributed forms. Except for ten associations that did not submit the forms, the others submitted them to the association.

### Planned Construction of Trunk Roads Directly to the North Station in Western and Southern Shanghai: The Construction Bureau Requests Approval from the Municipal Government

The Municipal Construction Bureau stated that the road administration in the various districts of the city has always been perfect, but after the situation changed, the supply of road construction materials was exhausted, and it was especially difficult to prepare the economic funds, so the maintenance projects and the plans to improve the road administration in the various districts have not been able to be fully implemented. In order to actively promote the city's road administration, the bureau is now striving to address the above-mentioned issues. After sending personnel to investigate, it was found that the traffic near the North Station is extremely frequent, especially with the current congestion of vehicles. The width of the original roads is insufficient, which is inconvenient for travelers. Therefore, it is planning to open trunk roads directly to the North Station from the western and southern districts of Shanghai in order to facilitate travel. It is currently preparing a detailed plan and submitting it to the Municipal Government. Construction will begin as soon as the budget is approved.

### Park Arrangement and Sports Facilities

The Municipal Construction Bureau intends to reorganize all the parks in the city, including Zhongshan, The Bund, Hongkou, Tongbei, Daxing, Taishan, Dihua, and Hengzhi, with the view to aspects of knowledge. In addition to arranging zoos separately, sports fields, children's playgrounds, music stages, flower beds, etc., will be set up one by one, so that citizens can adjust their bodies and minds, and also benefit in terms of knowledge.

### Three Dance Halls in Changning District Penalized for Overtime Business

Five dance halls in the Changning District of western Shanghai are doing booming business, so they often exceed the limited business hours. The director of the district branch, Yao Benyuan, investigated and dealt with them several times. Recently, it was heard that the dance halls were still operating overtime. Therefore, he secretly dispatched police officers and several policemen to patrol last night. As a result, it was discovered that the Country Inn and Argentina were still having guests. Manli Weituo was brightly lit and in further violation of the blackout regulations. Strict measures have been taken against them.

### Central Reserve Bank Issues Reduced-Size 500 Yuan Notes

The Central Reserve Bank will issue a brown 500 yuan note of the 32nd year reduced version starting today. The patterns, patterns, seals, signatures, and note numbers on both sides are the same as the brown 500 yuan note of the 32nd year version previously issued by the bank, but the area is smaller. This reduced version of the brown 500 yuan note is in general use with all the banknotes issued by the bank.

### Last Week's Financial Fluctuations Were Drastic

The financial situation in this city has recently been undergoing drastic fluctuations. Especially at the beginning of the week, the situation was even more chaotic, and the instigation of speculators was more frequent than before. Rumors shrouded the market, and people were unsettled, with an uncontrollable momentum. The black market for gold reached a peak of 130 marks, with an unprecedented rise. Other silver, public bonds, and Chinese stocks all experienced alarming price increases, with transactions showing a lack of sellers. After the financial authorities stepped in to suppress and strictly prohibit transactions, the sea breeze on Tuesday was slightly calmer, but people were still bullish and holders refused to release their goods. The situation remained tense, and the price of gold rose again. The popular Chinese stocks still had price limits, and public prices could not be lowered. On Wednesday, the bulls stopped advancing, and retail investors did not dare to absorb them. The market saw a correction, and gold retreated within 100 marks. Public prices for Chinese stocks also showed slight fatigue. After falling again on Thursday, the rising tide resumed in the afternoon. On Friday, gold was again above 110 marks, public bonds were slightly higher, and the momentum was still flat, but Chinese stocks generally rose, especially small stocks with no attention in the past, most of which rose due to enthusiastic purchases, and no fewer than dozens were suspended from trading due to excessive gains. On the other hand, popular stocks such as Mayar and Wing On were unable to rise further, and speculators shifted their attention to other small-value stocks, thus activating the general stock market. Therefore, in the first half of Saturday's market, amid the decline in gold, silver, and public bonds, small-value Chinese stocks still had price limits. The popular stocks, such as Mayar and Wing On, experienced severe declines. As for industry and commerce, there was also a hint of activity last week. Generally, those with funds took advantage of the long-standing gold, public bond, and Chinese stock turmoil. The authorities' suppression was expected to be stricter, so they used the gold to purchase and hoard materials. At the same time, the general public believed that the rise in gold prices had reached its peak, and that other commodities should rise in proportion to the price of gold. As a result, the black market price of rice, a major food commodity, jumped by 18 marks, about double the price. Flour, cooking oil, and miscellaneous grains also rose sharply. In addition, the retail prices of shops in various industries were uniformly increased. Woolen fabrics, leather goods, paper, and cotton textiles were increased by about 30% to 40%. After the authorities strictly investigated and prohibited unreasonable price increases after Wednesday, they gradually declined. The black market price of rice fell to around 10 marks, and the highest-quality rice was about 12 marks.

Important Correction

Yesterday on the second page of this newspaper, in the report of the Mass Rally of the National Salvation Movement, the sentence "saying in their mouths that they oppose Chongqing" in Chen Binhe's speech was a mistake for "saying in their mouths that they support Chongqing". It should be corrected to: "There are still some leaders in Shanghai who maintain their selfish, passive, and opportunistic attitude, saying in their mouths that they support Chongqing, but in fact they are using every opportunity in the peaceful area to seek windfall profits and engage in all kinds of speculation. These people have no national concept or social concept at all. Not only do we want to exclude them, but Chongqing is unlikely to tolerate them either."

### The Hubei Native Association Again Appeals for Relief to Hankou Disaster Victims; Hoping Enthusiastic People Will Generously Donate

Hankou has suffered repeated bombings by American planes, and the disaster victims are in urgent need of relief. The Hubei Native Association in Shanghai has specifically established a Relief Undertaking Committee. The chairman of the committee is Wang Shaocheng, and the standing committee members are Lu Xingjie, Lu Chuseng, Liu Jingzai, Li Chen, Li Ding'an, Zhang Liangdong, Yang Shaojing, Qin Runsheng, Xiong Juju, Tan Mingqi, etc. They appeal for relief to the Wuhan disaster victims and raise donations, with a brief announcement as follows:

Wuhan is located in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River, connecting the transportation hub between north and south, and gathering merchants from all over the world. It is one of the four major commercial ports in our country, with a population of over one million. About 30% are from this province, and about 70% are from other provinces, mostly from Jiangsu and Zhejiang, followed by Fujian and Guangdong, and then Sichuan, Hunan, Anhui, Korea, and other provinces. Recently, it has suffered repeated air raids, and the disaster situation is extremely severe. The prosperous urban areas have been turned into rubble, and people have broken bones and severed arms, supporting the old and carrying the young, exposed to the wind and sleeping in the open, with no home to return to. This association, based on the principle of human mutual assistance and the deep bond of kinship, has launched a fundraising campaign to engage in relief work, with fellow provincials soliciting donations in different ways. However, due to the vastness of the disaster area and the large number of survivors, even with all our efforts, it is difficult to provide universal relief. After repeated consideration, we can only appeal to various charitable organizations and great philanthropists in Shanghai, pleading for the disaster victims. It is said that saving a life is better than building a seven-storied pagoda. We earnestly implore all great philanthropists to have compassion and generously donate, and also ask them to widely solicit donations, the more the better, so that we can gather sand into a tower and collect fur into a robe, benefiting the disaster victims and bestowing upon them an kindness equal to rebirth. Once the donations are collected, we will immediately send personnel to Hankou to work with local authorities and charitable organizations to distribute the funds appropriately, ensuring that the funds are not wasted and the people receive tangible benefits. When the work is completed, we will publish it in the newspapers to provide credibility. We lay out our appeal sincerely, hoping for your kind consideration. Hubei Native Association Shanghai Relief Undertaking Committee.

Sports

### International Cup Soccer Final Italy Wins Championship

The International Cup soccer final, Italy versus Northern Europe, was performed at the racecourse yesterday starting at 10 o'clock. Because it belonged to the world of foreigners, there were not many spectators. The battle situation was very tense. As a result, with a score of one to zero, the Italian army won the throne. Although Northern Europe was defeated, its performance was excellent. It was different from the luck of the ball. It shot at the empty goal twice, both hitting the crossbar and bouncing out. Although the Italian army was able to win, according to its combat situation, it failed to meet its past standards. Referee Zhong Xiurong, the first half resulted in each keeping their virginity. In the midst of the second battle, Tekni near the goal shot hard in the ninth minute, going straight into the net, recording the opening. Then Northern Europe attacked hard. Fuen pulled the door from 20 yards away. At that time, Mai had already left, but unexpectedly, it hit the crossbar and bounced out again. Before the time expired, Northern Europe lost with a score of zero to one.

The B Group Soccer Final Vanguards Win Championship

Yesterday, in Jiaozhou Park, there were B and C group soccer fields. In the C group semi-final, Xuan battled India. As a result, Xuan defeated India with a score of six to zero. The second was the B group final, Donghua B versus Vanguards. There were no gains in the first half. At the end of the game, Vanguards defeated Donghua B with a score of two to zero, winning the B group throne.

### Hoping for Social Enthusiasts to Assist with Prisoner Rehabilitation Work; Director Li Broadcasts the Meaning of Crime Prevention

Li Shiyu, Director of the Third Department of the Police Bureau, broadcasted on the Shanghai Radio Station at 7:30 p.m. on the 20th, titled "Calling for Sympathy for Criminals," with the following main points:

The Meaning of Legislation Lies in Seeking Repentance. We know that, in the eyes of ordinary people, those who have committed crimes are hateful, unforgivable, and undeserving of sympathy. There is no need to plan for them, let alone appeal for them. The state sets penalties to punish criminals. Whoever violates the national criminal law should be subject to criminal penalties. This is undoubtedly true. However, in today's advanced criminal policy, the purpose of punishment is not revenge or suppression, but to make criminals deeply reflect on themselves. Capital punishment is for criminals who cannot be tolerated in human society, and it is necessary to deprive them of their lives, which is also out of necessity. The legislative meaning of all imprisonments is to hope that criminals will deeply repent during the execution of their sentences. Although penalties restrict their physical freedom, they should not harm their physical health, and should also reform their thinking and increase their skills, so that they can become sound and good citizens after their release from prison, just like a person who is sick and sent to the hospital, after diagnosis and treatment, but also to get rid of the root cause of the disease, and to restore him to health, becoming a strong person.

Fundamentally Cure Social Pathologies. In law, the criminal responsibility rests with the criminal himself. However, upon careful study, we can find that their crimes, whether in the motive, the factors, or the environment of the crime, are due to defects in national education, economic defects, or various social evils. Therefore, they cannot be entirely attributed to the individual criminal. The state and society should also bear a large part of the responsibility for him.

Crime has become a social pathology, causing great damage to society. If we do not engage in fundamental treatment and simply hate and oppress them, this disease will spread and never be eradicated. The criminals have certainly failed the state and society, but if the state and society still fail them, then they will certainly hate the state and society even more, and even resent the state and society. When they are released from prison after serving their sentences, they will do more anti-social work. Even if they die or starve to death in prison, their germs will be transmitted to people through the ruthless air. You can still remember the cause of death of the late Minister of Justice Zhang Yipeng, who died of typhus after being infected by sick prisoners while inspecting the detention center of the Shanghai Local Procuratorate. Those prisoners may also carry many germs outside, and it is unknown how many nameless people in society have died from infection!

The Number of Prisoners Dying of Illness is Alarming. We know that the total number of criminals in Shanghai is now 4,324, of which 229 are sick. This statistic is worthy of our attention. At the same time, the mortality rate of those awaiting trial is very alarming. In the prison, 12 people died in January, 23 in February, 30 in March, and 23 in April. In the detention center, 19 people died in January, 25 in February, 35 in March, and 20 in April. According to our past experience, the mortality rate will definitely increase when the weather is hot and humid, and now that the weather is gradually getting hotter, there are many epidemics, and most of the prisoners suffer from typhus, which is difficult to treat. The reason for their illness is partly due to infection, but mainly due to insufficient nutrition, poor air, lack of exercise, and infrequent exposure to sunlight. Furthermore, after becoming ill, because the medical system is not sound and the medicine fees are insufficient, many die from illness. Based on the above points, I feel that all parties should work together to remedy this defect, and to rescue the pitiful prisoners in the disaster.

Strictly Prohibit Abuse of Prisoners. I often warn the police that although prisoners should not be condoned, and they should do their best to investigate and expose the facts of the crime according to the law, they must never harbor private opinions or prejudices, abuse or assault prisoners, or use torture to extract confessions. I have repeatedly emphasized this, hoping that the police will understand. At the same time, we hope that people from all walks of life will supervise them. If they encounter torture or assault, they should come forward to report them, and we hope that the prosecutors and judges can be swift and accurate in their interrogation and trial, and make fair and just judgments. If prisoners are transferred to the prison for execution, in addition to paying attention to hygiene, there should be good education so that their spirits are comforted and their bodies and minds are healthy, and they are taught good skills so that they can become knowledgeable and capable people in the future. At the same time, I urge wealthy and powerful people in society to care about prisoners, because the government agencies are short of funds, to assist the health authorities in treating the diseases of prisoners as much as possible, and to reduce deaths. Recently, Mayor Zhou's wife donated a large number of bread to the prisoners detained in the police bureau. If enthusiastic charitable people can emulate this, then the prisoners will benefit a lot. This kind of rehabilitative relief work is of great significance in preventing crime. I deeply hope that people from all walks of life will work together.

### Bank Employees Respond to the Free School Fund

Mr. Liu Zhizhi, a staff member of the Shanghai Industrial Bank, in order to respond to this newspaper's free elementary school, has specifically donated 2,000 yuan from his usual savings to the "Free School Fund," and sent a letter expressing his enthusiastic support, with sincere words overflowing with expression. An excerpt is as follows: "When I see the news of your newspaper's Free School Fund every day, I feel unspeakably happy. I believe there is no shortage of enthusiastic people in society to sympathize with those poor students who have been deprived of their schooling, the future masters. Zhizhi, as a small bank employee, although his income is limited, in order to respond to the 'Free School Fund,' he is willing to donate the 2,000 yuan he usually saves from eating and using sparingly to the 'Scholarship Fund,' so that his heart can be temporarily at ease."

Donating Books. Lu Liangjun of the Recreation Department of the Fourth China Vocational Supplementary School Alumni Association sent a letter saying: "Please be informed that I am one of the persons in charge of the former Fourth China Vocational Supplementary School Alumni Association (Recreation Department). Although the association has been closed for many years, there are still some public goods left in the association. Now, because the association's address is being relocated, we are specifically donating the public goods left in this department to your newspaper's free school. The items are: 500 copies of Little Healthy Exercise, two national flags, one burning flag, and cash (converted from scraps of waste paper - three catties) 450 yuan. Please check and issue a receipt."

Yesterday, Chen Dexing and Ruan Laixing, students of the Fifth Grade A of Renzhi Elementary School, jointly donated 29 old textbooks, which have been received and used as textbooks for the free school.

### Leprosy Relief Society Solicits Donations

The Leprosy Relief Society of this city has been established for 18 years, and over the years has been running around and calling for help for the millions of leprosy patients in our country, such as promoting new methods of treatment, building new-style leprosy hospitals, editing leprosy publications, convening national leprosy conferences, providing medical and spiritual assistance to the poor and sick, preventing the mutilation of lepers, drafting leprosy laws for the government, and promoting isolation to prevent public transmission, etc. In addition to providing economic and spiritual assistance to leprosy hospitals in the country, the association raised funds in 1935 to build its own leprosy sanatorium in Miaohang Town, Dachang, a suburb of Shanghai, with more than 100 acres of land and more than 20 buildings, with a grand scale and complete equipment. Unfortunately, it was not long after its completion that it was hit by the war and moved to a safe area in western Shanghai, where it continued to operate. It has been eight years since then, and the food expenses alone for more than 100 patients require more than one million per month. The funds obtained last year have already been used up, and if we do not continue to find ways, we will inevitably run out of food. For this reason, the association has applied for approval from the authorities to start fundraising from the 25th of this month, hoping to raise 10 million yuan within a month to maintain the work. I hope that enthusiastic people from all walks of life will generously donate and help achieve this good deed.

### Joyful Gathering at Fuyou Orphanage

In addition to preparing refreshments for the joyful gathering, they will also show "The Children's Paradise" and other educational films to add to the fun. Each person will also be given a copy of the joyful souvenir donated by the Mede Stationery Store.

### Mr. Wu Shutong Generously Donates Air Defense Medicines

Mr. Wu Shutong, the manager of the Zhongju Bookstore, recently entrusted the Shanghai Health Association to prepare a large number of air defense medicines for distribution to 12 middle and primary schools in the city's Youth Association, middle schools, and Fudan Affiliated Primary School for standby use.

### When Should X-Ray Examinations be Conducted - A Prerequisite for Tuberculosis Prevention?

We know that all patients with progressive or open lung disease may have no symptoms or pain, so to prevent lung disease, X-ray examinations should be performed frequently to prevent life from being destroyed by tuberculosis bacteria unknowingly.

Then, when should X-ray examinations be performed? According to the opinion of Dr. Brownin of Germany, as follows:

Anyone suspected of having lung disease, regardless of whether they have any pain or symptoms, should undergo an X-ray examination.

Anyone suffering from respiratory diseases that have not healed for more than three weeks should undergo an X-ray examination.

Anyone who has frequently had respiratory diseases in recent years should undergo an X-ray examination.

If a doctor is treating a patient and it is a respiratory disease, an X-ray examination should be performed at the same time as treatment.

In summary, we can draw a certain law, that is, it is a mistake to determine that a person's lungs are healthy without an X-ray examination. In other words, without an X-ray examination, it is impossible to determine that a patient has no lung disease, so for accurate lung health diagnosis, X-ray examination is essential.

Anyone who looks healthy but already has lung disease, or has a respiratory disease and is suspected of having lung disease, should seek medical attention immediately and undergo an X-ray examination. This is of great importance to their personal health and prevention and control, although it is not easy to implement in our country at this time. However, ideals are the mother of success. If all our comrades can promote it as much as possible and cooperate fully, then this measure will surely be realized and succeed one day, and it is also a prerequisite for tuberculosis prevention. The China Health Association is holding half-price examinations in response to Tuberculosis Prevention Week, at 1,000 yuan per person, sold on behalf of this newspaper's Social Service Office, until the end of this month, and will not be extended. The address is 996 Jing'an Temple Road.
