The basic guiding principle for various implementations of this decision is to entrust the operation of local businesses to local responsible parties for decision-making, in light of future Sino-Japanese relations and the trends of the local economic situation.

### Observe Air Defense Regulations

Today is the seventeenth regular air defense day, and exercises are being held throughout the city. The purpose of holding regular air defense days is to constantly raise the vigilance of citizens so as to complete all necessary preparations for air defense in a timely manner. Under the current situation, enemy aircraft can arrive at any time. We must be on guard against each other and abide by air defense laws and instructions not only on air defense days, but also at all times, day and night, whether awake or asleep, and have air defense preparations in place.

Based on reports from relevant authorities after previous air defense exercises and various facts we have heard and witnessed, we deeply feel that most citizens still lack the necessary preparations for air defense and do not pay attention to air defense regulations. Not to mention the tragic situation in Berlin and London when they were subjected to air raids, even based on the enemy's bombing of Hankou and Guangzhou in recent months, citizens really need a full understanding and preparation for air defense work to reduce damage.

Regarding the most basic aspect of air defense work, light control, although it has been implemented for a long time, it has not been done satisfactorily. It is common for ordinary residences to leak light, and even among high-class residents of high-rise buildings, those without light shielding facilities can be seen everywhere. Moreover, outside of the regulated power supply hours, lights are still brightly lit, as if taking pride in illegal behavior. As for street vendors, countless sparks can be seen everywhere. Most strangely, even during air raids, some special classes of vehicles open their headlights, projecting bright beams that can be seen for dozens of feet, dazzling the eyes. Patrol personnel can only watch in amazement and dare not offer advice or discouragement. All these situations are harmful and without benefit to the city's air defense light control. We hope that the general public must inspect themselves at all times to avoid being severely punished after being detected. Furthermore, some special classes in high-rise buildings, who are beyond the reach of ordinary air defense patrol personnel's interference, should especially reflect on themselves. Those responsible for air defense should provide guidance and correction to ordinary residents at all times, and should carry out the duties entrusted to them by law without any hesitation, especially towards special classes, and should correct them at all times.

Regarding the reason why citizens do not pay attention to air defense work, it is due to certain misconceptions and wishful thinking. We should first recognize that once the European war ends, the enemy's adventurous ambitions toward mainland China will become more active. Do not be misled by rumors, thinking that certain areas will hopefully not be bombed, deceiving ourselves; or entrusting it to fate, seeking luck. All of this stems from an insufficient understanding of the situation and the city's environment. Such erroneous thinking is sufficient to invite danger to individuals or families. We hope that citizens will recognize the overall situation, not harbor the erroneous thinking of seeking luck and complacency, and that everyone will rise up and assist the authorities in completing all air defense facilities. Not only on air defense days, but also at all times, day and night, have a vigilance against enemy aircraft attacks, abide by air defense regulations, and complete air defense preparations.

### Strive for Aircraft Production, Open Up the Path to Victory

—Japanese Minister of Munitions Addresses the Nation—

Tokyo, 8th (Central News Agency) - Japanese Minister of Munitions Toyoda broadcast at 7:00 PM on the 7th, with the title "Aircraft Production Opening the Path to Victory." The main points of his speech are as follows: When we think of the Kamikaze warriors and why they risked their youthful lives to carry out ramming attacks, we feel emotions that cannot be described in words. In the current war situation, as long as there are sufficient aircraft, the battle will develop favorably. Sending as many and as strong aircraft to the front line as possible is the key to reversing the war situation today. Those engaged in aircraft production are like the Kamikaze units on the front line, who are rescuing the country from crisis. Our response is only to go to the rescue of the country in crisis, to be the Kamikaze warriors for the country, and to entrust to the comrades working in the rear the important task of supplying aircraft. With each aircraft and each warship, we dare to ram. Thinking of the fall of Saipan, the loss of Iwo Jima to the enemy, we must defend Okinawa to the end. Aircraft are composed of more than 10,000 parts, and it is a highly integrated industry. If any part is insufficient, excellent production cannot be ensured. Therefore, there must be a strict and thorough comprehensive plan and thorough work management. The current war situation is a decisive air battle on aircraft. In order to annihilate the stubborn enemy in Okinawa, we must strive to rush production of aircraft and send them to the front line to open up the path to victory. In addition, Yuan Yu, Director of the Bureau of General Affairs of this Ministry, has resigned from his concurrent position. It is requested that his concurrent position be removed, and it is proposed to appoint Cai Binglu as Director of the Bureau of Frontier Affairs of this Ministry, the resolution was passed.

### Inside Story of the Undercurrent Struggle Between the CCP and KMT in Chongqing

Central News Agency Shanghai News - According to reliable sources in this city: The friction between the CCP and KMT in Chongqing is intensifying, and the internal contradictions within the KMT in Chongqing are even more overwhelming. Factional differences and mutual confrontation exist. The CCP is most concerned about the Sixth Plenary Session convened by Chongqing to deal with the CCP. It held the Seventh National Congress of the CCP, advocating the promotion of a united government, while the Chongqing side also launched a political offensive to deal with the CCP at the Sixth Plenary Session. The inside story of this undercurrent struggle between the CCP and KMT in Chongqing is recorded as follows:

The CCP National Congress is Aimed at the Chongqing Side

According to a Xinhua News Agency dispatch from Yan'an, the Seventh National Congress of the CCP was held in Yan'an in late April. Mao Zedong made a political report at the congress, advocating the organization of a united government, stating that it was not for the benefit of the KMT in Chongqing, but to find a way out for China, and to strive for the realization of a united government and the implementation of a democratic program, and this goal must be achieved. At the same time, it also stated that a People's Representative Conference of the Chinese Liberated Areas would be convened as soon as possible in Yan'an. It should be noted that Mao Zedong's report is the consistent position of the Communist Party itself. Therefore, the significance of the Yan'an Communist Party convening a national congress as soon as possible is very noteworthy. Its intention is to deal with the Sixth Plenary Session convened by the Chongqing government on May 5. Since its establishment in 1921, the CCP has held six national congresses. However, after July 1928, the congress was suspended until the seventh congress was held this year, after seventeen years. Therefore, its purpose is to target the Sixth Plenary Session held by the Chongqing side.

Two Factions Oppose Each Other in the Chongqing KMT

At the Sixth Plenary Session held by the Chongqing KMT on the 5th of this month, Chiang Kai-shek gave a speech at the opening ceremony, proposing to convene the National Congress on November 12 and implement constitutional government to promote various necessary policies. His purpose was to deal with the Communist Party's political offensive. However, internal resentments and frictions exist within the Chongqing KMT. Currently, there are two opposing factions that have become sharply opposed. One is the national essence faction led by Chen Lifu, Minister of the Organization Department of the Central Party Headquarters, who has always opposed the CCP's actions. Their main strength is the Lizi Society, which is presided over by Chen Lifu and Chen Guofu, and they also have Xu Kejun, Director of the Investigation and Statistics Bureau of the KMT Central Committee, and He Yaozu, as well as Dai Li, Director of the Investigation and Statistics Bureau of the Military Commission, all of whom belong to the Whampoa clique. The most powerful faction in the Chongqing KMT to deal with Chen Lifu is Zhu Jiahua, also known as the pro-European and American faction. Their main strength is the Central Research Institute and the Three People's Principles Youth Corps led by Kang Ze, and the Cheng Society led by Zhang Lisheng, and they are close to Song Ziwen and Chen Cheng and graduates of the Baoding Military Academy. The contradictions between the two factions are quite significant. The Chen Lifu faction advocates Chinese localization and makes all plans based entirely on China's independent position, while the Zhu Jiahua faction relies on international solutions to maintain China's position. Therefore, there must be mutual friction at this Sixth Plenary Session, which will have a great impact. The Chongqing government is currently at a loss and is very depressed. Which direction it will take in the future, whether it will move towards China's independent position or rely on a third force to maintain its own position, is highly noteworthy.

### Japanese Rural Air Defense

The wishful thinking that "enemy aircraft bombings are limited to cities, the countryside is not important" is not allowed. During the ripening season of rice and wheat, enemy aircraft may use incendiary devices to disrupt things. At the beginning of the European war, the British Air Force scattered incendiary devices in the Ukrainian granary area occupied by the German army. Recently, the British Air Force stationed in China also used the same method in Dao County, Hunan Province, after it was occupied by the Japanese army. The opinions of the director of the Japanese Agricultural Administration Bureau, the head of the Defense Section, the head of the Rural Management Section, and the head of the Agricultural Products Section on rural air defense are summarized below in a question-and-answer format.

(Question) What countermeasures are there regarding rural air defense?

(Answer) Rural areas are different from cities, they are scattered, and houses are also sparsely separated, so it is difficult and absolutely inappropriate to formulate the same air defense countermeasures as in cities. Moreover, excessive dedication to air defense facilities will unnecessarily affect the nerves of rural people and hinder the farmers' main task of increasing production. As a result, other than general air defense countermeasures, the Ministry of Agriculture and Commerce has no specific guidance. However, since the situation is already like this, it is necessary to implement active air defense guidance.

(Question) Then, what is the central guiding principle?

(Answer) The general guidance is, first, to urge each household to build air-raid shelters, and second, to strictly implement lighting control, as strictly as in cities. In addition, there is one more thing that must be encouraged, and that is the preparation of water for fire fighting. In the countryside, most households have a well, but very few can be used as a source of water for fire fighting without any delay. For example, a well from which water is drawn with a bucket is not suitable in an emergency. Where there is no artesian well, a pool must be dug next to the house, twenty-four feet square is enough, and the depth is best more than two feet. This pool can usually be used as a fish pond, and it would be even more useful to raise some fish in it. In short, most farmhouses use thatched roofs, so the preparation of water for fire fighting is important at all times, both in emergencies and in peacetime. The above is only a general air defense principle that rural residents should follow, and farmhouses should pay special attention to the following items, namely, when working in the fields during the busy farming season: protect mature crops, protect agricultural warehouses (food warehouses), store food and seeds separately, store daily necessities such as furniture, tableware, and clothing separately, and protect livestock. During rice planting or harvesting, most people work in the fields, so a method of transmitting alarms in the fields must be determined in advance. When an emergency alarm is issued, it is best to take refuge in a nearby forest or hide in a pre-prepared cave, covered with straw or the like.

Protecting mature crops is really the most important thing. Currently, the enemy's bombing tactics are limited to incendiary bombs and bombs, and it is expected that incendiary fragments and pests harmful to crops will be scattered in the future, so it is necessary to prepare in advance. The measures taken by Fukuoka Prefecture, Japan, to deal with incendiary fragments are listed below:

Fire extinguishing countermeasures: Incendiary fragments are black celluloid plates containing white phosphorus, with an area of ​​five to six square inches. The yellow phosphorus ignites spontaneously and ignites the celluloid. The time from landing to ignition varies depending on the landing site and season. However, because of their shape and color, they are difficult to detect, so caution is required. Direct contact with white phosphorus can cause burns to the skin, so when found, it must be picked up with fire tongs and thrown into a container filled with water. Incendiary fragments that have already burned will be extinguished when watered, but will burn again when dry, so be careful when handling them.

Crop measures: Rice and wheat are not afraid of damage after the ripening period, but they are very flammable when ripe, so they should be harvested immediately when they are suitable for harvesting. (Translated from the Asahi Shimbun, April 6)

National Government Declaration of War

On December 8th of the year before last, at the beginning of the Greater East Asia War, the National Government, in accordance with the spirit of the Sino-Japanese Basic Relations Treaty, declared its determination to share weal and woe with the friendly nation of Japan. Since then, it has embarked on the New National Movement, engaged in safeguarding public security, improving people's livelihood, and striving to increase national strength to assist in the completion of the Greater East Asia War. However, Britain, the United States, and others continue to pursue their century-old policy of dividing East Asia, and have intensified their efforts, even colluding with elements in Chongqing to join the so-called British and American front, sending troops to Burma and India to have East Asians kill each other. Recently, their violence has been successively defeated by the land, sea, and air forces of the friendly nation of Japan, and their bases for invading East Asia have been lost. They are now resorting to more cunning schemes and disregard the peaceful development of the areas under the rule of the National Government. They use elements in Chongqing to continuously harass us to obstruct the progress of various constructions, and use their own aircraft, based in Chongqing, to bomb our Wuhan, Guangzhou, and other places, harming civilians. The elements in Chongqing, willingly driven by Britain and the United States, and personally acting as traitors to East Asia, are indeed shameful; while Britain and the United States, harboring ulterior motives towards East Asia, exhaust their ability to sow discord in an attempt to achieve their ultimate desire for annexation, which should be met with common hatred by the nations of East Asia. The National Government hereby declares that from today onwards, it is in a state of war with Britain and the United States, and will do its utmost to cooperate with the friendly nation of Japan to overthrow the cruelty of Britain and the United States, in order to seek the restoration of China and the liberation of East Asia. The two countries of Manchukuo and Thailand have always maintained friendly relations and share the same determination for the prosperity of East Asia. In the future, they should strengthen cooperation in order to jointly build a new order in East Asia based on morality. The friendly nations of Germany and Italy have been dealing with the forces of Britain and the United States in the West for several years and have repeatedly achieved glorious victories. Our country now joins the Greater East Asia War, and we should echo each other in order to contribute to the just new order of the whole world. All our citizens should know that this is the only opportunity to realize Mr. Sun Yat-sen's Greater Asianism. The restoration of the Republic of China, the realization of the construction of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, and the attainment of justice and peace for the whole world depend on this; they should unite their hearts and minds, fight to the end, and fulfill this great mission of this great era. January 9, 31st year of the Republic of China Chairman Wang Zhaoming

### The European War Ends with the Signing of the Treaty in Reims, the New German Foreign Minister Broadcasts to the Nation

Stockholm, Sweden, 7th (Central News Agency) According to a London dispatch, the British Intelligence Agency announced that, according to the agreement between the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union, British Prime Minister Churchill is scheduled to make a formal statement and broadcast an address at 3:00 PM on the 8th.

Stockholm, Sweden, 8th (Central News Agency) According to a British radio broadcast last night, prior to the announcement of Germany's surrender, frequent radio contact was being conducted between London, Moscow, and Washington for final emergency consultations. The exact time when Prime Minister Churchill announced the end of the European War at his official residence was also determined based on the results of this discussion. The announcement of the end of the war is now merely a technical matter.

Tokyo, 8th (Central News Agency)

Associated Press News: At 2:41 PM yesterday (French time), Germany unconditionally surrendered in Vincent, Reims, France, where General Eisenhower's headquarters are located. Thus, the European War, which lasted for five years, eight months, and six days, was officially declared over. The surrender treaty was signed by General Jodl, Chief of Staff of the German Army, on behalf of Germany; General Smith, Chief of Staff of Eisenhower, on behalf of the Supreme Headquarters of the Allied Expeditionary Force; General Susloparov, on behalf of the Soviet Union; and General Sevez, on behalf of France. General Eisenhower was not present at the signing, but immediately met with General Jodl and his delegation, as well as General Friesburg. He asked them if they could implement the terms of surrender to Germany, and they replied, "Yes." After the German radio broadcast General Dönitz's order to all German troops to surrender unconditionally, Germany's unconditional surrender was officially announced.

Broadcast Speech by the German Foreign Minister

German Foreign Minister Krosigk broadcast to the German people: "Fellow countrymen, the Supreme Command has ordered the German army to surrender unconditionally. After nearly six years of valiant fighting, Germany has succumbed to the superior forces of the enemy. To continue fighting would only be meaningless bloodshed. The government, which bears the responsibility for Germany's future, has requested the enemy to cease hostilities in the face of the collapse of human and material resources. We express our deepest sympathy to the German soldiers, but the nation should not deceive itself about the severity of the conditions imposed on Germany by the enemy. It is inevitable that Germans will be required to make extreme sacrifices in their lives. Germans must bear this heavy burden, and being loyal to our duties and goals is equally sacred. We will do our utmost to restore Europe from the wounds of war."

### Truman Meets with Grew

Lisbon, 8th (Central News Agency) According to a Washington dispatch: President Truman met yesterday with Acting Secretary of State Grew and Assistant Secretary of State Clayton.

### Sharing Fate with Berlin, Hitler Commits Suicide, the Remains of Goebbels Have Been Discovered

Tokyo, 8th (Central News Agency) According to a dispatch from Mr. Ejiri, a special correspondent of the Domei News Agency stationed in southern Germany: The announcement of Hitler's heroic suicide was a major blow to the German people. Well-informed sources said that Hitler insisted on sharing fate with Berlin, which declared the disintegration of the Nazi Party's rule in history, so that the German people and the Nazi Party's ideals could have a chance to recover. Top generals had advised Hitler to leave Berlin, because they thought it was especially important for Hitler not to die in a major crisis. He had once allowed them to leave Berlin at the last minute, so they prepared

Special Aircraft

An aircraft was prepared for use, capable of taking off on the "East-West Axis" road, which was 70 meters wide (the road passes through Berlin's Tiergarten, only 300 meters from the Reichstag), but Hitler decided to stay in Berlin to prepare for a heroic suicide. The reasons for his change of plan are still unknown, or it is believed that he hoped to attract a large number of Soviet troops to inflict a fatal blow on them, and he believed that he could achieve his goal by personally commanding the battle. When the Soviet army invaded Süssen, 50 kilometers from Berlin, and Beelitz, 70 kilometers from Berlin, the encirclement of Berlin was completed. At that time, Hitler already knew that his plan had failed, so he decided to

Self-Destruct

Other well-informed sources believe that the failure of the plan to join forces with the British to destroy Bolshevism prompted his decision to commit suicide. The ideas in his book "Mein Kampf" have not been shaken. Hitler also mentioned this in his speeches after the outbreak of the war. Although some suggested that he should seek peace with the Soviet Union, Hitler refused and had no intention of compromising with Bolshevism. According to reliable sources, Hitler opposed the German-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact, but was eventually persuaded by former Foreign Minister Ribbentrop. According to neutral sources, on April 21, Hitler sent Himmler and Dönitz to northern Germany to make

Final Appeal

to England, with the Swedish Red Cross as an intermediary, but this attempt still failed. Thus, his last dream was shattered, and Hitler decided to commit suicide in the hail of bullets in the German Parliament. It is said that Hitler died on May 1, when he had handed over military and political power to Dönitz, but it is clear that Hitler was determined to die in battle. Previously, on September 3, 1939, Hitler had appointed Göring as his first successor and Hess as his second successor. Now Hess has been excluded, and Göring has lost popular support for failing to reorganize the German Air Force to resist the Allied air offensive, so Göring is no longer considered a suitable successor. This is the reason for his resignation. Submarine warfare expert Admiral Dönitz was only a major shortly before the outbreak of the war. He was promoted to admiral within five years and was highly respected by Hitler and other leaders. Although Dönitz was a protector of Hitler, he was not a member of the Nazi Party, which is one of the reasons why he was chosen as Hitler's successor.

Stockholm, Sweden, 7th (Central News Agency) London dispatch: British government authorities announced on the 7th that the remains of Dr. Goebbels, his wife, and children have been found in Berlin. However, the remains of the Führer and Marshal Göring have not yet been found. According to an Associated Press dispatch from Moscow, Soviet soldiers are investigating the bodies found in the Führer's residence, but Hitler's remains have not yet been found.

### Spain, Portugal, and Sweden Announce Severance of Relations with Germany

Lisbon, 7th (Central News Agency) Madrid dispatch: Within 24 hours after the Portuguese government severed relations with Germany, Spain also severed diplomatic relations with Germany. At the same time, the German embassy and consulate staff were required to withdraw abroad by 1:00 PM on the 8th.

Stockholm, Sweden, 7th (Central News Agency) The Swedish government announced on the 7th that it had severed diplomatic relations with Germany.

### Five Foreign Ministers Hold Talks

It was announced that the meeting was to discuss general matters of the meeting and to discuss the international trusteeship system.

British Proposal for the Three-Headed Conference

Lisbon, 8th (Central News Agency) According to a United Press dispatch from San Francisco, the Polish war will not be resolvable unless it goes through the three-way agreement of Truman, Churchill, and Stalin. According to a Soviet dispatch from London, the British government believes that it is unwise to unilaterally determine relations and advocates that the three-way talks be carried out.

### The United Kingdom and France Negotiate a Treaty of Alliance

Lisbon, Central News Agency on the day of entry According to a telegram from San Francisco, French representative Bete and British representative Eden are currently negotiating the conclusion of the British and French true hunts.

### Japanese Ambassador Hidaka's Whereabouts Unknown

Zurich, Seventh Shenyang Electric Power Agency According to a report from Münster: Japanese Ambassador to Italy Hidaka and Major General Shimizu and his party had intended to enter Swiss territory before, but their whereabouts are unknown as of today. Ueda, the secretary of the German mission, arrived at the border Münster on the 4th and searched everywhere to no avail.

### The 17th Air Defense Day is Implemented Today, and the City's Response to Various Training Alarms Should Be Closely Watched

Today (9th) is the 17th Air Defense Day. The Municipal Air Defense Headquarters, as usual, will expand the promotion of the significance of air defense and implement various air defense training. The whole city will enter a state of air defense. The implementation of the training is for alarm training, local area training, and comprehensive training in designated locations in the areas under the jurisdiction of the Jing'an Temple, Jiangning Road, and Putuo Road sub-bureaus, as well as air defense training within factories and buildings that have special air defense groups. Under the guidance of military police and Baojia personnel, citizens should strictly follow and implement the exercises to ensure that they are proficient in air defense measures in order to cope with any emergencies.

Alarm Training Does Not Sound Sirens

This time, the book reporting training will not sound sirens for issuing and canceling orders, and will implement alarm transmission training such as sounding gongs and displaying signs and flags. Therefore, citizens should pay close attention to the alarm time (see the newspapers of the 6th), especially to traffic control and lighting control, which must be strictly implemented and must not be treated as child's play and neglected, otherwise they will be severely punished.

### Strictly Enforcing Lighting Restrictions to Ensure Citywide Peace: Speech by Li Zhenhuan, Deputy Chief of the Air Defense Section

Li Zhenhuan, Section Chief of the Air Defense Section of the Police Department, delivered a broadcast speech yesterday from 7:20 PM to 8:00 PM on the importance of lighting restrictions and the method of using gongs as an alternative to air raid sirens, as well as other air defense issues. The details are as follows:

During this decisive stage of the Greater East Asia War, the danger of air raids in this city is also becoming increasingly urgent. Therefore, all air defense facilities are urgently needed and brooks no delay. Although the Army and Navy Air Defense Headquarters, the Citizens' Air Defense Headquarters, and the Police Department have made great efforts to provide guidance and the Baojia Self-Defense Corps has provided assistance in the past, citizens are still indifferent. During air raids, citizens often look up at the sky during the day, like children playing games. The danger is great, not only because of falling bombs that cause casualties, but also because anti-aircraft shells can fall and injure people at any time. Therefore, during the day, when encountering an air raid, people should quickly take refuge in air raid shelters and not watch on the streets to avoid the danger of stray bullets and shrapnel. At night, when encountering an air raid, people must not turn on lights or use candles to avoid becoming a target for bombing. The following points are to be brought to everyone's attention:

Lighting Restrictions

The meaning and importance of lighting restrictions: Attacking aircraft are not easily discovered at night and can easily fly to their destination. The biggest target is lights, especially the lights of large cities that reflect on the sky and can be seen from a distance of one or two hundred miles, making them vulnerable to attack. If the lights can be concealed, so that the incoming aircraft lose their target, this is the purpose of lighting restrictions. If all the lights in the city are concealed, but a very small number of citizens do not comply with the lighting restrictions, then all the citizens will be endangered by air raids. The damage to people's lives and property is not small, so the authorities will severely punish those who do not comply.

Lighting restrictions are divided into three types: 1. Preparatory restrictions: Unnecessary lights for daily life, such as neon lights, door lights, and advertising lights, cannot be used. 2. Alert restrictions: During an alert warning, store lights that are not necessary must not be turned on, otherwise, residential lights must be shielded to prevent light from escaping. 3. Air raid restrictions: All lights must be turned off or shielded, so that no light leaks. It is hoped that citizens will not leak light and pay attention to the following items: 1. Indoor lights must be covered with lampshades. 2. Windows must be covered with black cloth. If there are shutters, the shutters must be closed. 3. The most important thing is skylights, which people usually do not pay attention to, but are very obvious in the sky. From now on, the police will launch a thorough crackdown on lighting restrictions, and it is hoped that citizens will pay attention.

Knowledge of Wells

During air raids, water pipes are sometimes damaged. In the interior, river water is available, but in Shanghai, when tap water is cut off, there is nowhere to get water. There is only one remedy, that is, digging wells. It is hoped that citizens will dig more wells in each Jia [traditional unit of households], for the following purposes: 1. For drinking and eating. 2. For fire fighting (for fighting fires, such as incendiary bombs). 3. For washing (washing clothes and cleaning).

The Citizens' Air Defense Headquarters has contacted well-digging merchants to ensure that well-digging prices are cheap and the materials used are good, so that citizens can get all kinds of convenience. If you want to know the details, you can go to the Air Defense Headquarters at 280 Fuzhou Road, first floor, opposite the Police Headquarters on the Fourth Road.

In order to anticipate obstacles in reporting, the following two methods will also be used in addition to issuing and lifting alarms: Alert warning (and oral communication): White flag, strike the gong three times each time (each time about five to ten seconds apart). Air raid warning (and oral communication): Red flag, strike the gong ten or more times. Lifting of air raid warning (and oral communication): White flag (same as alert), strike the gong three times each time (each time about five to ten seconds apart). Lifting of alert warning (and oral communication): Team flag, strike the gong two times each time.

If it is a training alarm, a yellow flag must be added to the flag.

The word "training" must also be added when striking the gong, wait for shelter each time strike the gong ten or more times in a row (same as air raid alarm).

The only difference is that the word "wait for shelter" is used in oral communication.

In addition to the above two methods that have been implemented, the authorities are planning various

methods in order to be as perfect as possible.

The word "training" should be added to the oral communication during training.

Building Air Raid Shelters

Air raid shelters are safe places for citizens to take refuge during air raids. Air raid shelters have now been set up in each police sub-bureau area, but some air raid shelters do not have covers, and some air raid shelters are not fully equipped, which is entirely due to economic limitations. When digging in Shanghai to two or three feet, water is discovered, so only semi-underground (that is, one half underground and one half above ground) air raid shelters can be built. Although this type of air raid shelter cannot resist direct hits, it is very effective in avoiding the danger of blasts, shrapnel, and anti-aircraft shells if a bomb falls nearby. It is hoped that citizens will universally build air raid shelters. The Citizens' Air Defense Headquarters in this city has detailed plans. If citizens want to build air raid shelters, they can inquire at the headquarters.

### This Newspaper's Obligatory Elementary School Continues to Recruit Students and Textbooks

The ten obligatory elementary schools established by the Obligatory Education Committee of this newspaper have been in session since last month. On average, each school has about 100 students, and there are still many impoverished children who continue to apply for enrollment. In order to prevent students who are rejected due to full capacity from being out of school, it was decided at the second Obligatory Education Committee meeting to increase the number of students in each school and add classes. Classes are now being opened in order. Regarding the textbooks used by the obligatory school students, there is still a shortage of first, second, third, and fourth grade textbooks for Elementary Chinese Language, General Knowledge, and Arithmetic. It is deeply hoped that enthusiastic people from all walks of life will donate generously to complete the project.

A Passionate Heart

Mr. Xu Yibing, the principal of Wude Obligatory Elementary School, came to this office yesterday, stating that the school has been closed, and donated the remaining 31,800 yuan as obligatory school funds. Mr. Xu is dedicated to obligatory education and shares the same goal, dedicating all the remaining funds to support the obligatory schools, and his enthusiasm is commendable.

Mr. Zhu Xitian, the principal of Xiude Elementary School, wrote: "Deng Xueli, a fifth-grade student at our school, voluntarily donated 3,000 yuan of candy money saved from her daily expenses for the use of the obligatory schools. Although it is just a drop in the bucket and cannot solve the problem, her passionate heart is commendable, so I am sending it here and hope you will accept it. I also hope that elementary school students throughout the city will respond to this call, save money, and donate it to the obligatory schools, so that impoverished children will benefit more."

### The Municipal Government Has Approved the Supplemental Application for Special Allocation of Rice for Teachers and Staff

The Municipal Education Bureau and the Goods Allocation Office jointly handled the application for special allocation of rice for teachers and staff of public and private schools at all levels in this city last September. The application procedure for this item has already been closed. However, there are still some schools that failed to apply and get approval on time due to incomplete procedures or the principal leaving Shanghai. It is heard that Director Dai of the Education Bureau, considering the difficult living conditions of the staff of the above-mentioned schools, specially reported the situation to the Municipal Government, ordering them to submit the list of names for verification. The bureau is now rushing to produce various application forms and styles, notifying the schools to submit the application within the 10th to 24th of this month. Those who have previously submitted a supplementary application but have not yet been approved must also fill in the new forms again in order to ensure uniformity and facilitate issuance. Furthermore, in the future, when there are changes in the staff of each school, the prescribed forms should be requested from the Education Bureau for investigation and reporting, in order to be verified and handled.

Application Method

Schools that do not comply with the order of the Ministry and charge students for rice or use the converted value of rice as tuition fees shall not apply.

For schools applying for special allocation of rice, the school shall purchase an application form from the Shanghai Special City Goods Allocation Office, fill it out according to the format, and then create a master list of all teachers and staff as stipulated by the Education Bureau, as well as a survey form for the application for special allocation of rice, in triplicate each, and a general survey form for the school as stipulated by the Education Bureau, in one copy each, and submit them to the Education Bureau for review. After review and approval, the application form and the master list of employees will be stamped with the "Verified and Approved" seal or the "Provisionally Approved Allocation" seal. The Education Bureau will submit the application form, the master list of employees, and two copies each of the survey form for the application for special allocation of rice to the Municipal Government for approval. After approval by the Municipal Government, the application form and the list and forms will be ordered to the Goods Allocation Office for allocation, and the Education Bureau will instruct the applying schools to go to the Goods Allocation Office to collect the allocation certificate.

If the schools applying for special allocation of rice are combined from universities, middle schools, and primary schools, the survey form for the school should be filled out separately, and all application forms and master lists of employees for the application for special allocation of rice should be combined.

For schools applying for special rice, the number of teachers and staff shall not exceed the standard for the number of staff in the school as stipulated by the Education Bureau. If the number of staff already approved is requested to be increased, an application form must be attached with a written explanation of the reasons, and submitted to the Education Bureau for review and then submitted to the Municipal Government for approval, and the Goods Allocation Office will be instructed to increase the allocation quota.

Those who have been approved for allocation for the first time and are applying for subsequent periods must still follow the provisions of Article 2 of this method. If there are increases, decreases, or changes in the number of teachers and staff, the reason for the change must be clearly stated in the "Registration" column of the master list of employees. If a teacher or staff member resigns midway and is not replaced, the school shall directly return the surplus allocation coupons and report the number and quantity of the returned coupons in triplicate to the Education Bureau for verification and the Municipal Government for the Goods Allocation Office to record.

If the allocation certificate has been received and a staff member resigns midway and is replaced by someone else, the applying school shall fill out a staff change report in triplicate and submit it to the Education Bureau for verification and the Municipal Government, and inform the Goods Allocation Office.

Teachers and staff who also work at other schools should be identified as applying for allocation at one school. Those who do not receive rice at that school shall not fill out the application.

After the principal of each school receives the special rice allocation coupons for all staff members, they should be properly kept and issued to the staff members monthly and on time. They shall not be issued in advance to avoid shortages of allocation certificates due to staff changes or new and old coupons. They shall not intentionally withhold or hide the allocation certificates that should be issued on time.

If the school has agreed with the teachers and staff to provide meals, they shall not withhold the allocation certificates that the staff members are entitled to receive.

Anyone who falsifies names or falsely reports the number of people, intending to fraudulently receive more allocation certificates, or violates any of the provisions of Articles 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10 of this method, once verified, in addition to the penalty methods separately stipulated by the Goods Allocation Office, the Education Bureau shall impose a penalty based on the circumstances, and if the circumstances are serious, it shall be submitted to the Municipal Government for verification and handling.

The Goods Allocation Office or the Education Bureau may, when necessary, send personnel to investigate whether the names and numbers of teachers and staff members who receive special allocation of rice at each school are in compliance, and the situation of issuing allocation certificates.

### Municipal Government Subsidizes Welfare Fund for New Association

### Education Bureau Holds Talk Meeting with Vocational School Principals to Discuss Rectifying School Spirit and Other Issues

First, Director Dai reported the purpose of convening the talk meeting and raised issues such as rectifying school spirit, school registration, school evacuation, and rice allocation, and provided a written opinion. The principals of each school expressed their opinions and conducted detailed discussions separately. Finally, Director Dai summarized the opinions of all parties and drew conclusions, stating briefly: Regarding the issue of school spirit, during this period of serious situation, the mission of university students is extremely important. Each school should actively provide guidance to make them aware of their thoughts and respectful in their lives, and promote various legitimate entertainments, such as sports, music, and art activities, so that they can move towards the right track. Regarding academic aspects, they should also step up supervision and improve standards. On the one hand, schools should conduct investigations and punishments at any time and notify parents to pay attention. On the other hand, relevant agencies should conduct strict investigations and crackdowns. Regarding the issue of registration, as the case involves legal procedures, each school should prepare separately so that it can be handled in accordance with the regulations issued by the Ministry. Issues such as evacuation were also discussed, and the meeting adjourned after 6 o'clock.
