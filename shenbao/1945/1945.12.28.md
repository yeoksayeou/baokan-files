The government side was represented by Chairman Zhang Qun, Minister Wang Shijie, and Secretary-General Shao Lizi. The Communist side was represented by Zhou Enlai, Ye Jianying, and Wang Ruofei (Dong Biwu was absent due to other commitments). They exchanged opinions on matters related to the cessation of military conflict and the convening of the Political Consultative Conference for approximately two hours. Both sides displayed a strong desire for concrete solutions.

[United Press, Chongqing, 27th] Government and Communist representatives held an informal meeting today to discuss arrangements for the upcoming Political Consultative Conference. This marks the first meeting since the KMT-CPC negotiations stalled on November 17th. Some Chinese newspapers suggest the Consultative Conference will not be held before January 10th, but this date has not been confirmed. The arrival of President Truman's special envoy, General Marshall, in Chongqing has heightened national interest in the upcoming Consultative Conference and the ongoing negotiations. Since arriving last Saturday, Marshall has met with representatives from the government, the Communist Party, and the Democratic League, gaining a good understanding of their respective positions. Marshall has indicated he is open to hearing from anyone. Chinese newspapers are publishing daily commentaries on Marshall, which are read aloud to him each morning by a translator. The *Shishi Xinbao* reported that Marshall loves flowers and received a bouquet from Madame Chiang Kai-shek yesterday. The lengthy articles published in the newspapers are clearly intended to catch Marshall's eye.

[Associated Press, Chongqing, 27th] An Associated Press special correspondent reports: The hope for peace in China has suddenly intensified today as the KMT-CPC unity negotiations, which had been stalled for 40 days, have resumed. It is widely believed that this is largely due to General Marshall's initial activities in Chongqing. The KMT and CPC negotiators met at 5 PM and agreed that a ceasefire would be the first item on the agenda. The Communist side formally submitted a written proposal for an immediate and unconditional ceasefire. Political figures hope that general ceasefire principles can be agreed upon, with the other specifics being handled by the Political Consultative Conference, currently scheduled to be held in January. The participation of Communist Chief of General Staff General Ye Jianying has strengthened public confidence in the negotiations. Other Communist representatives at the roundtable include Communist Deputy Chairman Zhou Enlai, Political Consultative Conference delegate Dong Biwu, and Wang Ruofei. The Nationalist Party is represented by Foreign Minister Wang Shijie, Sichuan Province Chairman Zhang Qun, and National Political Council Secretary Shao Lizi.

After two hours of detailed discussion, the Communist side praised him as "an expert at listening to opinions," and stated that he was extremely interested in the resumption of unity negotiations and the upcoming Political Consultative Conference.

### Construction of Yangtze River Water Conservancy Project; Technical Design Phase Begins; China Has Paid Initial Working Costs; Engineers and Technical Experts in the United States Participate in the Project

[Central News Agency, Washington, 26th, Associated Press] Engineers from the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation will begin designing a general plan for developing the Yangtze River basin. The Chinese government plans to build the world's largest dam and hydroelectric plant in the Yangtze River basin, irrigating ten million acres of land and preventing the area from suffering floods again. However, this project is still in the technical design stage, not the engineering design stage. U.S. Secretary of the Interior Ickes announced that the Chinese government has paid the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation $250,000 to cover initial planning work expenses. It is estimated that the total project cost will reach approximately $500,000. Bureau officials emphasized that the United States will only be limited to supplying design and methodology books for the Yangtze River development plan in China, and all expenses and engineering aspects will be handled solely by the Chinese government. The payment by the Chinese government is based on a recent agreement and was transferred by the New York Office of the Resources Commission. According to the recent regulations, U.S. engineers will be responsible for the entire design and detailed methodology books of "a grand irrigation and hydroelectric power generation plan aimed at storing and controlling the water power of the Yangtze River to develop China's agriculture and industry." In addition to the aforementioned giant dam and hydroelectric plant, the plan also prepares to build hundreds of miles of crisscrossing irrigation canals and small dams, as well as other facilities to regulate the Yangtze River and its tributaries. The main engineering feature of this plan is to build a dam on the Yangtze River at the Three Gorges near Yichang to create a reservoir that is 250 miles long. This dam will be even larger than the famous Grand Coulee Dam in the United States. Its power generation facilities will generate a huge amount of electricity to develop industry, and the Yangtze River's shipping facilities will also be improved so that large ships can penetrate deep into China. Chinese engineers and technical experts will participate in the planning work under the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation engineers.

### Gold and Silver Hoard in Jiangxi Found to Have Been Stolen
### Heir Files Lawsuit with Anhui-Jiangxi Supervisory Envoy's Office, Sufficient to Resume Track-Laying Project on Entire Nanchang-Xunyang Line

[Central News Agency, Jiujiang, 27th] The case of a large amount of gold and silver hoard discovered in Zhaobin Village, Shangfu Town, Fengxin County, Jiangxi Province, being stolen has caused a sensation throughout the province. The hoard is located in the Wang family of Zhaobin Village and was originally the property of a prominent official during the Qing Dynasty. Later generations, due to the decline of the family, transferred the house to the Liu family, timber merchants from Wucheng. The Wang family descendants were unaware of the hoard's location and only attached a note in the sales contract, stating that if a hoard was discovered in the house in the future, it should still belong to the Wang family. After the Liu family took over the property, they successfully operated the timber business and also became wealthy. Not only did they not excavate the hoard on their property, but they also continued to add to the hoard. In 1942, the villagers of the village took advantage of the Liu family's absence to evacuate and stole eleven hoards. Later, armed soldiers excavated thirty-seven hoards. Liu Sixun, the heir of the Liu family, returned to his hometown and discovered that as many as forty-eight hoards had been stolen. He filed a lawsuit with the Anhui-Jiangxi Supervisory Envoy's Office. It is said that the amount of gold and silver lost is very large, sufficient to resume the track-laying project on the entire Nanchang-Xunyang line.

An American commentator reported on Moscow Radio that the three foreign ministers met for six and a half hours yesterday afternoon and continued to discuss after dinner. Yesterday was the most intense day of work, but the process was very satisfactory, and the future is very promising.

[Reuters, London, 27th] A Columbia Broadcasting Company commentator recently broadcast from Moscow that US Secretary of State Byrnes left Moscow at 8:30 this morning (4:30 PM Shanghai time) to fly to Washington. Byrnes originally planned to return to the United States via Berlin and Paris, but weather conditions forced him to change his plan and had to cross the Balkan Peninsula to Naples, and then fly to Casablanca. Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov, Deputy Foreign Minister Vyshinsky, and all Soviet representatives who participated in the Moscow Conference went to the airport to see him off. British Foreign Secretary Bevin hopes to leave Moscow this afternoon, but has not decided.

US Secretary of State Talks: The Meeting is Very Constructive

[Reuters, Moscow, 27th] After the Three-Power Foreign Ministers Conference ended, US Secretary of State Byrnes hosted a press conference and said: Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union have agreed to establish a committee on atomic energy. This meeting was very constructive, and the relationship between the representatives of the three countries was very harmonious, and they were able to explain their problems in a friendly spirit. There is one point that I can tell you, that is, there is no agreement on any topic not recorded in the communiqué. I say this because some people want to know if there are any secret agreements on topics not mentioned, which is quite important. The communiqué will mention atomic energy and stipulate the establishment of a committee. When you see the communiqué, you can explain the problem, and nothing outside the communiqué was discussed. The final communiqué will be issued at 3:00 AM on Friday (11:00 AM Shanghai time). In addition to the events recorded in the communiqué, the three foreign ministers also informally discussed several other events, exchanged opinions, and clarified them to the governments of the respective countries, so it will be easier to take actions agreed by the three governments in the future. Byrnes also said that an "economic agreement" had been discussed in the meeting, and its main points will be announced in the communiqué. He also said that he had notified the French ambassador in Washington and after arriving in Moscow that no events affecting the French government would be discussed except for the peace conference, and any events affecting France would be notified to the French side. As for events affecting China, the Chinese government will also be constantly notified. The last meeting of the three foreign ministers was held on the eleventh and twelfth days after the start of the meeting, lasting for thirteen and a half hours, with two short breaks for meals. The last break was at 2:30 AM today (10:30 AM Shanghai time). One hour later, the three foreign ministers gathered and signed the documents.

Qualified observers in London believe that the issues of Iran and other issues in the Middle East were discussed in the meeting, but they will not be recorded in the final communiqué. If the general public believes that compromises have been reached on other important topics that may have been discussed in the meeting, then this meeting will greatly advance the cooperation of the three powers. London also speculates that the results of the Moscow talks may include an agreement on Allied cooperation in the Far East, such as the establishment of an Allied Council for Japan in addition to the Far Eastern Advisory Commission.

### United Nations Organization
### Secretary-General Candidates

Pearson is the most popular

[United Press London, 26th] Today's "New York Times" reported: When the five powers held a meeting here recently, the election of the Secretary-General of the United Nations Organization was the first topic discussed. The newspaper said that representatives of the five countries, the United States, Britain, the Soviet Union, China, and France, met on the 24th to elect members of the Security and Social Economic Council. It is reported that the Secretary-General selected by the Soviet Union is an Eastern European, but his name has not been disclosed. It is believed that this choice will be dissatisfied with the Western countries, because they advocate that a non-European should hold this position. The newspaper said that the most popular Secretary-General candidate at present is Canadian Ambassador to the United States Pearson, who is more popular than Belgium's Spaak or the Netherlands' Kleffens. Although British officials have received a definite "hint" that General Eisenhower cannot serve as Secretary-General, they still welcome Eisenhower's candidacy.

### Regarding the Peace Treaty Issue
### France Drafts Reply

[Reuters Paris, 27th] Semi-official sources said that after the Moscow communiqué on the eve of Christmas is released, France may submit a request, advocating that France participate in the discussions of the Balkan peace treaty meetings, and the full reply is being drafted, and it is expected to be sent to the three countries of Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union this week.

### "Little Glass Eye"
### Sentenced to Life Imprisonment

[Associated Press Yokohama, 27th] A few hours ago, the US military court sentenced Tsuchida, nicknamed "Little Glass Eye," to life imprisonment for abusing and killing American prisoners of war. This afternoon, it continued to try Captain Yuri, the former director of the Omuta Prisoner of War Camp in Kyushu. The defendant stood upright in court and pleaded not guilty to all charges. The prosecutor requested the death penalty, arguing that officers should be responsible for the violence of their subordinates.

### MacArthur Reduces the Power of the Japanese Emperor
### Helping Japan Build a Democratic Government
### Eradicating the Control System and Restoring Freedom and Independence to the People
### Socialist Party Demands that the Prime Minister Should Be Elected by the People

[This Newspaper Tokyo, 27th Exclusive] The Shinto religion in Japan has now been abolished, so the last evil root of the Emperor system has been eliminated, and feudal tendencies have gradually disappeared in the minds of the people. The first step of the Allied Headquarters to transform Japan was to abolish the Japanese Army and Navy Ministry, and ordered Japan to surrender all weapons. After that, another far-reaching action was to destroy the power of the Japanese imperial police and all thought control. At the same time, in order to make the disarmament of the Japanese army effective, the Allies must give the Japanese people freedom of speech, assembly, and belief in the early stage of the occupation. In addition, the Allies implemented currency control, agricultural reform, the right of workers to collectively negotiate with capitalists, and equitable distribution of food, so that the people were completely out of the control of the military and moved towards democratic politics.

The previous controlled life of the Japanese people was the main factor in creating the ruling power of the Emperor system, and the tool of the ruling group was the distribution of grace and war profits. The Japanese government collected taxes entirely by manipulation, so that the Japanese people struggled for survival all the time. However, the above controls have now been completely destroyed, and the Emperor system has also ceased to exist. According to MacArthur's instructions, the Japanese government will start to implement the agricultural reform bill in the middle of next month. The bill stipulates that the land owned by each person should be limited to 12 mu. MacArthur has not yet expressed his opinion on this. The Ministry of Finance is studying and drafting two regulations on the collection of property tax from the Japanese Emperor. In order to support Japanese democracy, MacArthur, trade unions, chambers of commerce, and legal entities in various places have begun to organize, and the strength of new political parties is also becoming stronger day by day. The Japanese Communist Party requested that the general election be postponed for several months so that the people's thinking and the organization of new political parties can be improved and become equal to the old political parties. The newly established Independent Socialist Party demanded that the Japanese Prime Minister should be elected by the Japanese people and can no longer be appointed by the Japanese Emperor. At present, the task placed before the Japanese people by the Allies is to establish an equal government to replace the supreme Emperor government. This is an important task that must be closely monitored and guided by the Allies in order to promote its realization as soon as possible and accomplish the task of the Allied occupation of Japan.

### International Monetary Agreement
### Officially Signed Yesterday
### Representatives of 24 Participating Countries

[Associated Press Washington, 27th] Representatives of the 24 United Nations countries are scheduled to officially sign the Bretton Woods International Monetary Fund Agreement and the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development Agreement at the State Department at 4:00 PM today. Finance Minister Vincent has been ordered by President Truman to sign on behalf of the United States. Other countries participating in the signing include China, Britain, Mexico, Colombia, Czechoslovakia, Ecuador, Egypt, El Salvador, Abyssinia, Iceland, India, Iraq, the Netherlands, Norway, Paraguay, the Philippines, South Africa, Yugoslavia, the Dominican Republic, Greece, Honduras, Luxembourg, and Bolivia.

[Associated Press Paris, 27th] The French Parliament approved the Bretton Woods International Monetary Agreement yesterday and passed the US Export-Import Bank's 550 million franc loan. The franc devaluation case was also passed by the parliament.

### Japanese Government Archives Discovered in the Vault of a Building
### Very Helpful for Interrogating War Criminals

[Central News Agency Tokyo, 27th] The US occupation forces discovered a complete archive of Japanese government documents in the vault of an isolated building about 30 miles west of Tokyo. All records of Japanese cabinet decisions and imperial edicts since 1885 were stored in 72 exquisite wooden boxes, which will provide valuable information for the future interrogation of Tojo and other senior Japanese war criminals. Each document has the signature of the Japanese Prime Minister and the Japanese Emperor's seal. The Japanese authorities explained this as an avoidance of damage from air raids, but failed to explain why they did not report it to the Allies in advance.

### Philippine Traitor Willing to Be the Enemy's Lackey: Castile Executed

[Associated Press Manila, 27th] Philippine traitor Castile, who induced about 1,000 Filipinos to be massacred by the Japanese army, was sentenced to death by the People's Court today. In March of this year, Castile falsely claimed that the Japanese army could guarantee safety and lured the villagers of Lumpet to gather in one place, all of whom were massacred by the Japanese army. This is the first Philippine traitor to be sentenced to death, setting an important precedent for all those who act as lackeys for the Japanese.

### U.S. Plans to Expand Global Air Routes, But Only a Small Portion Can Be Opened

[United Press International, Washington, 26th] Global air transportation is developing rapidly, and eventually airplanes will be able to reach any location at any time. The U.S. has drafted detailed plans for such air routes, and has also prepared sufficient personnel, equipment, funding, and management talent. However, because governments have not agreed on the exchange of commercial airspace rights, only a small portion of air routes can be opened at present, except for military transport.

U.S. air routes are advancing towards Europe, with two companies already operating routes to the UK. One company will extend its routes to the Nordic countries, while the other plans to fly along the southern coast of Europe, via the Mediterranean to Egypt and India. The Great Circle route across the North Pacific may be opened later, as the Soviet Union has not yet expressed its attitude towards commercial aviation rights, and the North Pacific route has never been used by civil aviation aircraft, requiring more surveying and training work.

Recently, the most frequently flown routes have been those in the Central Pacific, South Pacific, and South Atlantic. In addition to the political issues of obtaining aviation rights, airline executives also face other thorny issues, such as maintaining ground equipment, collecting weather reports, and establishing communication networks, ensuring seamless operation in all countries.

Political issues stem from national sovereignty and economic concerns, making them difficult to resolve. However, significant progress has been made since the World Aviation Conference held in Chicago last year. The Provisional International Civil Aviation Organization, composed of thirty-seven countries, is currently studying various issues.

The organization's headquarters are located in Montreal, Canada. The U.S., without waiting for free airspace rights or a general agreement, is first negotiating with relevant countries one by one to establish mutual agreements, seeking temporary solutions. If the U.S. does not proceed in this way, its enormous aviation potential will be indefinitely limited to the Americas. Other countries are also following suit, with the UK being particularly prominent.

In terms of achievements, twenty countries have accepted the so-called "two freedoms of the air," namely the mutual exchange of rights to fly over national borders or land in other countries. Some countries have even accepted the "five freedoms," in exchange for allowing commercial aircraft to enter and exit their borders. In short, agreements are signed by the parties involved, allowing for the exchange of general rights. Through the promotion of the "two freedoms," large areas of previously inaccessible airspace have been opened up, some of which are essential for the world's most important air routes, such as Canada, Newfoundland, the British Isles, the United States, China, India, France, the Nordic countries, the Netherlands, and some South American countries. With the establishment of mutual agreements, both parties can truly obtain aviation rights in the aforementioned important regions.

In addition, there are extremely difficult technical problems that are inevitable, such as the maintenance of airport, airway, weather reporting, and communication equipment. Currently, this equipment is managed by military transport agencies, but with the end of the war, military personnel are gradually demobilizing, and funding is also gradually decreasing, with valuable equipment being removed or abandoned. The aforementioned international provisional organization is considering this issue and has begun to examine what equipment is necessary and how to continue to operate it without abandoning it. If all member states agree, the organization will have the authority to manage this matter or act as an intermediary between countries.

[United Press International, Washington, 26th] Mr. Frailey, the current president of Continental and Western Airlines, announced today that the company's international air routes will fly east from the United States to Europe, via the Near East to Bombay and Colombo, and then extend to Singapore, Hong Kong, and Shanghai. The company expects to obtain aviation rights to extend its air routes eastward from Bombay and Colombo to the west coast of the Pacific, or from India in two directions to Shanghai. However, the proposed route may not pass through Colombo, the Malay Peninsula, Vietnam, Hong Kong, and then to China. Another route is from India to Singapore, and then from Singapore to Hong Kong. The company's proposed Far East aviation expansion plan may be connected to the air route that flies west from the United States via the North Pacific to Shanghai. The company will also apply to open a Pacific air route, and once approved, its planned round-the-world flight will be realized. Expanding the Far East aviation industry can promote its economic development, airplanes can expand trade and create more opportunities for the people, and airlines can help break down trade barriers and increase much-needed transportation. It is hoped that these rights can be obtained from relevant parties in the shortest possible time.

### Soviet Army Prepares to Stay in Germany for Another Decade, American Reporter Reports on Inspection

[United Press International, Berlin, 27th] Within eight months of Germany's defeat, the Soviet Red Army has transformed northeastern Germany from a destroyed machine into a peacetime institution, and the Soviet army is prepared to stay there for a long time—at least ten years. The Soviet army and German liberals (mostly Communists) are working closely together. Recently, a group of foreign reporters spent eight days inspecting 750 miles of the Soviet-occupied zone and finally discovered what the Soviet army has accomplished.

In the past few months, Germany has spread rumors that the Russian-occupied zone has fallen into chaos and disorganization, but the foreign reporters' inspection proved that the Soviet Union is very realistic and effective in handling occupation affairs.

There are absolutely no unemployed people in the Soviet-occupied zone, because the Soviet Union has abolished the old bank loan system, requiring every German to work for food. Inflation is better than in the west, and most non-war industries have resumed work, but war factories have either been dismantled or transported away as compensation.

Rumors that there is no industrial activity at all in the Soviet-occupied zone are dismissed with a smile by German provincial officials. Currently, 85 percent of non-war factories have begun manufacturing consumer goods. Active Nazis have been imprisoned, and nominal leaders have also been replaced. The Soviet Union's attitude towards Germans who are not radical Nazis seems to be more lenient than that of the United States, which has expelled all Nazis, but the Soviet Union has handed this issue over to the German public government to handle.

Metal and mineral mines are not allowed to operate, but all coal mines are in operation. Production is almost the same as before the war. As for food, German officials told reporters that the current food supply cannot be maintained for long.

Germans have absolute freedom of religious belief. Soviet officials said, "You can't make cannons in churches."

The Soviet authorities did their best to give reporters a good impression. A Soviet major who accompanied the reporters on their inspections was completely exhausted after returning to Berlin. The five American reporters were also quite tired because they had "toasted" Soviet-American friendship no less than 10,000 times.

The American reporters were welcomed and treated well everywhere they went. Although the Soviet Union monitored them, they were responsive to the reporters' requests. There was only one exception: the American reporters requested to inspect the Province of Shalingji, which was rejected by the Soviet Union on the grounds that the location was not within the designated inspection area.

### U.S. Pacific Five Air Forces Under Unified Command of MacArthur to Control Japan and Strengthen Air Defense

[United Press International, Tokyo, 26th] MacArthur announced today that the five Pacific air forces will be under unified command in order to control Japan and strengthen America's vast air defenses. The air force is named the U.S. Army Pacific Air Forces, and the position of commander has been promoted from General Kenney, the former commander of the Far East Air Forces, with Lieutenant General Whitehead, the former commander of the Fifth Air Force, as deputy commander, and Major General Climent as chief of staff. The forward headquarters are located in Tokyo, and this headquarters governs five air forces, namely (1) the Fifth Air Force stationed in Korea and Japan, (2) the Seventh Air Force stationed in Hawaii, (3) the Eighth Air Force stationed in Tokyo, (4) the Thirteenth Air Force stationed in the Philippines, and (5) the Twentieth Air Force stationed in the Mariana Islands. The personnel quotas of each army remain the same, with General MacArthur as the supreme commander, and Major General Hulph as the commander of the Tokyo forward headquarters. Hulph, who previously served as commander of the Twentieth Bombardment Unit in India and China, also serves as commander of the Fifth Air Force. Among the five air forces, the Eighth and Twentieth Air Forces originally belonged to the U.S. Army Strategic Air Forces, while the remaining three air forces belonged to the Far East Air Forces.

[United Press International, Tokyo, 27th] According to today's announcement, MacArthur will have two new aides to assist him, one being Colonel Weller, who will serve as senior aide and army secretary, and the other being Lieutenant Hogan. During the war, only four other people served as MacArthur's aides.

### British Troops Besieged in Batavia, Set Up Alert Lines

Fierce Fighting Resumes in Bandung Area

[Reuters, Batavia, 27th] Allied Commander General Christison of Java has ordered the deployment of military alert lines around Batavia to identify people entering and leaving Batavia and prevent bandits and terrorists from infiltrating. The Allied Headquarters Bulletin stated that the deployment of military alert lines is a necessary initial measure to stabilize the city's order and ensure the safety of all ethnic groups. It is reported that no unexpected incidents have occurred since the military authorities were ordered to take this measure. Previously, only troops were stationed at certain key roads in the suburbs of Batavia, which was not as strict as this time.

[Reuters, Batavia, 27th] The Allied forces will begin new operations based on the decisions of the Singapore Conference. The British and Indian troops in Bandung continue to clear out the extremists in the area. Street fighting has occurred, and they have finally occupied the extremists' base, seizing some military supplies, food, and clothing. Allied Headquarters said that the extremists used Chinese people as shields to prevent the British and Indian troops from sweeping through the area. Gunfire can still be heard in Batavia at night. The Indian artillery that bombarded the Chinese-owned civilian camp in Angbala several weeks ago has also begun operating 30 miles north of the area.

### U.S. Rear Admiral Sherman Appointed Chief of Operations

[United Press International, Washington, 27th] Rear Admiral Sherman was appointed today as Chief of Operations of the Naval Headquarters. Rear Admiral Sherman previously served as Deputy Chief of Staff to Admiral Nimitz, Commander of the Pacific Fleet. After transferring to his new position, he can continue to work with Admiral Nimitz, Chief of Naval Operations.

### European U.S. Occupation Zone, Refugees Seek to Move to America

[United Press International, Washington, 26th] President Truman revealed in a statement from the White House that he had instructed the State Department and the Attorney General to expedite the transfer of vagrants and refugees in the U.S. military occupation zone in Europe to the United States, in order to "alleviate human suffering and set an example for other countries in the world." The President emphasized that this aid measure will be strictly implemented in accordance with immigration laws and will not delay the return of overseas military personnel. He also stated that the current focus on Europe does not mean that passports will be completely suspended in other parts of the world.

### International Women's Association Demands Overthrow of Franco Regime, France Has Invited Britain and the United States to Hold a Meeting to Jointly Review the Spanish Issue

[United Press International, Washington, 26th] U.S. Acting Secretary of State Acheson told reporters today that the United States has received a document from France requesting a study of future relations with Franco. He said that France may convene a three-country conference, and said that the United States is "happy" to review all aspects of the Spanish issue. It is expected that France will suggest severing relations with the Franco regime.

[Reuters, London, 27th] Britain, the United States, and France will convene a meeting to discuss the attitude to be taken towards the Franco government in Spain. The meeting can begin as soon as France decides on the time and place. France recently sent a message to Britain and the United States suggesting a break in relations with Spain. Britain and the United States replied that they were prepared to meet with the French government to discuss the matter. However, Britain's reply did not advocate an immediate break in relations, and the United States, while not expressing sympathy for the Spanish government, remained silent on the issue of a break in relations. The United States believes that it is sufficient not to allow the Franco government to become stable at present, and there is no need to encourage a change of government. It is generally believed that the British government's reply must not have concealed the Labor Party government's aversion to the Franco regime, and it hopes to establish a stable democratic government as soon as possible. Last night, the Spanish Free Radio called on the people to join the guerrillas to overthrow the Franco regime, and the International Women's Democratic Association in Paris also sent a telegram to the foreign ministers of the three major powers in Moscow, representing 81 million members, demanding the overthrow of the Franco regime. The association was established after the International Women's Congress closed, and China is also a member.

### George Bernard Shaw Suggests Innovative Alphabet to Write Each Sound with Simple Symbols

[United Press International, London, 27th] Literary giant George Bernard Shaw wrote to The Times today, urging the British government to establish a committee to draft a new alphabet so that every sound in the English language can be written with a single stroke and simple symbols, even without punctuation. The time saved by the new alphabet can immediately repay the cost of the war. According to Shaw, phonetic spelling can replace Dr. Johnson's erroneous spelling in the past. For example, the word "bomb" should be spelled "bom," omitting the final silent letter "b." He can write "bomb" eighteen times in one minute, which is roughly identifiable, but "bom" can be written twenty-four times, saving a quarter of the time. As for the daydreams of ordinary people, such as advocating the promotion of a world language, the alphabet drafting committee should clearly declare that it has no intention of participating.

### Local Dispatches

Songjiang

Telegram Requesting Cessation of Grain Coupon Issuance

The county government intends to issue circulating coupons due to insufficient funds allocated for purchasing military grain at the provincial price, as reported in this newspaper. Now, County Magistrate Huang believes that Chamber of Rice Industry Director Zhu Ziyu is avoiding responsibility by feigning illness, leading to misunderstanding. Zhu Ziyu has been arrested and taken into custody from Shanghai with a deadline to deliver the grain. Regarding the issue of issuing circulating coupons, Wu Shaoshu and other fellow villagers from Songjiang residing in Shanghai have sent telegrams to the Jiangsu Provincial Government, Special Commissioner Xie of the Third District, and County Magistrate Huang, requesting the cessation of issuance and requesting the provincial government to allocate funds to purchase grain in order to avoid disrupting the financial system.

Traitor Ye Jiugao and Others Escorted to Suzhou
Ye Jiugao, the former director of the Puppet Rice Control Association, has been arrested by the county government. As the case of a traitor should be tried by the High Court, he was escorted to the Suzhou High Court for interrogation, along with Gao Yalin, Xia Chunshan, and others who were arrested in other cases for translating for the Japanese enemy. A police team was assigned to escort them together.

Changshu

County Magistrate and Garrison Commander Inspect Together

County Magistrate An Weinan, out of concern for public security, inspected Baimao, a border town in the eastern township, together with Garrison Commander Yu, receiving a warm welcome from the local people. At the same time, the North District Command of the Changwuqing Suppression Zone announced that a curfew would be implemented from 11:00 p.m. to 5:30 a.m. every day, starting today, to strictly prevent the activities of traitors and puppets and maintain public security.

Wuxi

County Government Ordered to Encourage Purchase of Military Grain

The county government has been ordered to encourage the purchase of 80,000 shi of military grain. Rice merchants in the urban area have already purchased 20,000 shi and delivered them to the warehouse for acceptance. The remaining 60,000 shi will be purchased in two more installments. The first 20,000 shi will be purchased from the rural area. The county government has ordered the four rural district offices to encourage the purchase, with a deadline for delivery. The price is set at 5,000 yuan per shi, including transportation costs, with penalties for overcharging or under-delivering. Incentive measures have also been established and ordered to be followed.

Jiaxing

Tax Rice Collection Situation

In Jiaxing, the amount of tax rice collected by landlords from tenant farmers has traditionally been determined annually by party and government personnel and farmer representatives in each district after investigating the harvest yield. The amount is agreed upon in accordance with the 25% rent reduction policy and announced for both parties to comply with. The harvest yield this year has already been investigated and agreed upon. The harvest yield in Jianan (i.e., the old Jiayi) is 1.4 shi per mu. After the 25% rent reduction, the tax rice payable is 5 dou and 2.5 sheng. After deducting 8 sheng for borrowing to purchase military grain, the actual amount collected is 4 dou and 4.5 sheng. In Jiabei (i.e., the old Xiuyi), the yield is 1.6 shi per mu. After the rent reduction, the tax rice payable is 6 dou. After deducting 8 sheng for borrowing to purchase military grain, the actual amount collected is 5 dou and 2 sheng. Currently, the landlords believe that it is time to collect rent since the winter solstice has passed, while the tenant farmers believe that the set amount of tax rent is too high, so most are waiting and not paying.

Wenling

Smooth Navigation Between Wenling, Shanghai, and Wenzhou

Since the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, Wenzhou in eastern Zhejiang has gradually recovered under the active reconstruction efforts of the local government. Since the beginning of this month, four commercial vessels, including "Chuanshan" and "Dahua," and three steamers have been sailing directly to Shanghai from Wenzhou. In addition, three "Jiangdong" steamers are sailing between Taizhou and Wenling, providing convenience for merchants and travelers, which has further boosted the local economy. However, due to purchases by Shanghai merchants, the prices of local products have been gradually rising.

### The Scenery of Yunshan and Zhujiang is Unchanged, New Guangzhou Marches Forward

— Special Correspondent Liang Feng of This Newspaper

Baiyun Mountain is as lush as ever, and the Zhujiang River flows on as it always has. Returning to Guangzhou after an absence of seven years, I, the reporter, see the Pearl River and the mountains, still much as they were. Although during these seven years, this place has been shrouded in gloom, producing many tragic stories and burying much blood and tears, now, finally, after the rain comes the clear sky, and after the clouds, the sun rises, making one deeply rejoice: the land has been restored to light!

As I stepped onto the docks of Guangzhou, the first thing that caught my eye was the magnificent Haizhu Bridge, spanning the Zhujiang River, and the Ai Qun Hotel, standing tall with its seventeen stories. Seeing them safe and sound brought a sense of infinite comfort. Indeed, while these two buildings may not fully represent Guangzhou, I believe every Guangzhou resident returning after seven years would inevitably feel the same way!

Heavy Traffic - Changdi is More Prosperous Than Before

Changdi is even more prosperous than before, with heavy traffic on the roads, and people bustling about, extremely crowded. Especially at night, the large restaurants such as Datong, Jinlun, Jinlong, and Dasanyuan are brightly lit and filled with music, with virtually no empty seats. The Ai Qun, White Palace, Xinhua, Dongya, and several newly opened large hotels are always fully booked, and travelers from outside have difficulty finding a room even after waiting for more than a week. On the surface, it seems that Guangzhou's market is now more prosperous than before the war, but this is only the case in the Changdi area. If you leave this area and stroll along the other roads in the city, you will find that Guangzhou is in a dilapidated state. Just look at the area behind the Xidi Daxin Company. Originally, it was full of buildings with four or five stories or more, but now it is almost a flat ground, desolate and deserted. Although one or two buildings stand alone, they are just empty shells. The most bustling Xiguan Shiba Pu and Hanmin Road in the city are no longer what they used to be, eerily quiet. There are no newly built buildings, and the original ones are mostly dilapidated, making one think of the line "The carved railings and jade stairs should still be there, but the fair face has changed." Almost every road is riddled with holes, and riding in a rickshaw will make your buttocks ache. The streets and lanes are full of garbage, and every corner is piled with flies. From all this, it is clear that during the seven years of occupation, Guangzhou only experienced destruction and no construction. The traitors of the puppet regime only cared about plundering money and oppressing the people, and did not even bother to repair the roads or take care of sanitation. This transformed the once picturesque and vibrant birthplace of revolution into a listless old man, like a declining and broken household, which is truly heartbreaking.

Disciplined Military - Citizens Immediately Express Goodwill

After the victory, the first troops to enter the city were the Special Operations Forces, whose military discipline was poor, leaving a bad impression on the people. However, soon after, the New First Army arrived, changing the people's perception. Because the New First Army's achievements in Burma may not be easily known to the people in the occupied areas, they would know that the Japanese army had been defeated in Burma. Therefore, they knew that this army was the one that defeated the Japanese, and they naturally had infinite respect and welcome for these expeditionary soldiers. In particular, the New First Army's equipment was entirely American-style: steel helmets, thick khaki uniforms, yellow leather boots, Thompson submachine guns... All this was not only novel to the people in the occupied areas, but even the people who had returned from the interior seemed to have never seen such equipped troops. They all said in unison: Our country has indeed become stronger!

Public Security - The Most Serious Problem

Public security is probably the most serious problem that any recovered area would consider, and Guangzhou is no exception. One often hears news of bandits breaking into houses with weapons and robberies on the streets. According to Police Chief Li Guojun's report, more than 50 robbery cases have occurred since the takeover on September 19th. Strangely, most of these robberies occurred in the residences of Taiwanese and former officials of the puppet regime, and more than 30 cases have already been solved. However, the military and police authorities are still actively working to maintain public security. A curfew is still in effect after 10 p.m., and no people or vehicles are allowed to pass without a curfew pass. One night, the reporter was questioned by more than five sentries on a journey of less than 100 meters, which shows the extent of the security. Previously, these sentries were dispatched by the New First Army, but now the security team of the Provincial Security Headquarters is responsible for this night watch.

Water, Electricity, Telephone - The Authorities are Trying Their Best to Repair

Tap water, electricity, telephone - these are most closely related to everyone's daily life, and the current situation is that the saying "the roads are uneven, the tap water is not clear, the electricity is not bright, and the telephone is not working" is a perfect description of Guangzhou's current situation. Because the power plant, telephone office, and even the water plant, all the machinery and equipment are from eight years ago. During the enemy's occupation, there was no construction at all, and these machines have become outdated. The water reservoir has accumulated several feet of mud, and the water pipes, power lines, and telephone lines have been neglected for a long time. In this situation, what else can be done? Therefore, these problems are enough to give the municipal authorities a headache. Now the city government is making its best efforts to solve these problems. In the past two months, there have been significant results. Now we can see many workers repairing roads, repairing power lines, and repairing water pipes on the streets every day. At the same time, there have been no long-distance buses running in Guangzhou for four or five months before the liberation. Now, in order to maintain traffic in the city, the Municipal Public Works Bureau has converted the trucks left by the enemy into public buses. There are already more than 100 of these buses in operation, and the fare is very cheap, with each ticket costing only 40 yuan, regardless of distance. Military personnel and civil servants can also get half-price tickets, which provides a lot of convenience to the citizens. Another thing worth mentioning is the issue of cleanliness. It is unknown where so much garbage came from. When we came back, it was really everywhere, and the stench was overwhelming. Later, the authorities made a decision to clean it up. Mayor Chen (Ce) even personally took a broom and demonstrated in the street, and also used Japanese prisoners to take on this work. After more than a month of effort, the city is now much cleaner than before. Speaking of cleaning up garbage, I am reminded of the situation of Japanese prisoners in Guangzhou, which is also worth reporting. There are 4,689 Japanese soldiers and 3,317 Japanese nationals collected here. They are well-fed and clothed in the concentration camp, and they are leisurely and comfortable. In addition to clothing and equipment, there are also undershirts, socks, soap, cigarettes and other miscellaneous items that are adequately supplied. Moreover, the residences are very spacious, with beautiful scenery and fresh air. There are also diagnostic rooms, treatment rooms, and rest rooms. Now, every 200 Japanese prisoners are lent 10 rifles, with 10 bullets for each rifle. Under such unexpected preferential treatment, they are all grateful and tearful. Therefore, at present, in the concentration camp, their military style and public security can still maintain a good attitude.

Japanese Prisoners Work - No One Eats for Free

Recently, in order to make the most of these Japanese prisoners who are sitting and eating, the authorities have transferred a part of them with technical expertise to work as drivers and repair various machines. The rest are required to assist in cleaning. Now, every morning, you can see teams of Japanese prisoners dragging garbage trucks or carrying brooms, very obediently cleaning the streets. They are still the same, with small, pointed caps and patched "imperial" army uniforms. Everyone's faces are expressionless, and they dare not look people in the eye. Their cramped expressions look quite pitiful. One newspaper published a cartoon of a Japanese prisoner sitting on a garbage truck with a broom on his shoulder, titled "New Equipment of the Japanese Imperial Army." Another store selling wine wrote in its advertisement: "He works as a cleaner, I drink with joy." Once, the reporter had a brief conversation with a Japanese prisoner who was performing cleaning work:

"What do you think about being asked to do this kind of work?" the reporter asked him sympathetically.

"We are defeated prisoners, we can only obey orders," he replied in broken Cantonese, a somewhat unnatural smile on his face, unable to hide his inner melancholy.

"You sweep garbage every day, don't you have any thoughts?" the reporter asked him again.

"...Nothing else, I just feel that your country's garbage seems to be endless," he hesitated for a moment and said this barbed sentence.

"Of course, this is the garbage accumulated over seven years, of course it cannot be swept away in one day; and the bloodstains of the past seven years, I am afraid it is even more difficult to wash away!" the reporter retorted unceremoniously.

He just lowered his head and pondered, no longer speaking, and our conversation ended like this.

American Ships Arrive in Guangzhou - Prices Begin to Fall

Speaking of the prices in Guangzhou, they were indeed very cheap for a period of time. An ordinary shirt only cost 400-500 yuan, and a pair of leather shoes cost 3,000-4,000 yuan. However, now all prices have increased several times. Now an ordinary shirt costs more than 5,000 yuan, and a pair of leather shoes costs at least 10,000 yuan. If you want to order a suit from a tailor shop, it will cost no less than 140,000-150,000 yuan. It is said that prices are rising every day because visitors from Chongqing, Kunming, Guiyang and other places, especially soldiers, all say that things are cheap and don't care, throwing money around without hesitation, so merchants are raising prices on the spot. In fact, this is certainly one of the reasons, but the main reason is that the stock is limited and foreign ships have not yet brought goods, so all goods are becoming less and less every day. The so-called demand exceeds supply, so of course there is no reason why prices should not rise. However, since this week, because two American ships have arrived in Hong Kong, bringing a lot of goods, and more will come in the future, department stores have already started to fall back. Merchants in Hong Kong and Macau are dumping large quantities of goods stored in Guangzhou. Generally people estimate that prices here will continue to fall!

United States to Sell Private Monoplanes

The United States is currently manufacturing a type of Erco Ercoupe private monoplane and has begun accepting customer orders at a price of $2,994 per plane. Note: The Erco Ercoupe private aircraft adopts a rotary design and is equipped with three special landing wheels. This aircraft can carry two passengers and can carry 5,000-6,000 pounds of baggage. The wingspan is 30 feet, the height is close to 6 feet, the fuselage is 20 feet 9 inches, the maximum range is 500 miles, and the speed per hour is 110 miles. The rudder and ailerons for maintaining aircraft balance can be controlled freely, and there are safety devices. When practicing flying, it only takes one-third of the time of ordinary aircraft.

### Ten Hundred Million Asians Together Strike the Bell of Peace and Freedom, Striving to Prevent the Far Eastern Storm from Sweeping the World. Translated from the December Issue of Reader's Digest.

The peace of the Pacific is a paramount issue for all countries and peoples of the world. With peace in the Pacific, there is a foundation for world peace; without peace in the Pacific, the entire world will once again suffer the ravages of war.

Clearly, in the Pacific region, we need a new way of life. After four years of fighting the enemy, we can no longer ask a billion Asians to return to their former lives of merely providing fuel and water for other nations of the world and consider themselves content.

Preventing Enemy Aggression and Destroying Enemy Ideology

We have stopped the Japanese from aggressing, but we have not destroyed the idea that the Japanese brought with them and cultivated in this fertile soil. This idea is the so-called "Co-Prosperity Sphere," which refers to a geographical area where all peoples with similar lifestyles, skin color, and customs are united into a political whole.

In reality, this is just a hypocritical slogan. It only became Japan's Asia. But the idea itself is correct and cannot be morally attacked. It will endure in Asia and must not be condemned as rebellion. This is the renaissance of the Far East. Westerners can help develop it into a massive force to contribute to peace.

The Japanese planned to merge the various nations and countries of Asia into a single collective. This is too arbitrary and too difficult. A more reasonable idea would be to divide Asians into three major federations according to natural racial branches: the Malay, Chinese, and Indian. Here, we will first discuss the situation of the Malay Federation—a political and economic collective consisting of 200 million Malay speakers living in the Philippines, Java, Celebes, Malacca, Sumatra, the Malay Peninsula, Siam, Burma, and Vietnam.

I grew up in Asia. Shortly before the war, I traveled among the Malays through Thailand, Burma, Java, and the Straits Settlements. Everywhere I went, I observed a yearning for freedom and a rebellion against the white man.

In Java, underground leaders representing millions of farmers hid in secret organizations in the forests, holding midnight meetings to organize liberation movements. In Burma, the voices of the people demanding liberation could be heard everywhere—among sweepers, cinnabar miners, students, merchants, and government officials.

Everywhere I went, I saw the hateful racial discrimination that undermines human dignity. I saw noble Burmese women step into the mud to make way for white people. In Singapore, I saw noble Malays forbidden from entering British restaurants and clubs. I saw Cambridge and Oxford graduates barred from teaching in their own country's elementary schools because they had not bowed deeply enough to the Dutch supervisors.

Everywhere, there were haggard brown people wrapped in dirty sarongs, their faces filled with sorrow, barely resembling human beings. Among them were no playful children, only unfortunate little ones sold by their starving parents to become economic slaves. They did not know how to play; they had never had the energy to play.

The Atlantic Charter Guarantees Autonomy for All Nations

Therefore, it is easy to understand why, when racial hatred had the opportunity to be vented, all the white people everywhere except in the Philippines, in order to protect their own lives, not only had to defend against Japanese attacks but also had to guard against the Malays whom they had insulted for many years. Because Japanese imperialism could be used as a tool to eliminate white imperialism, these Asians accepted it first and then sought ultimate liberation.

This demand seems to have been answered in the Atlantic Charter, as the Atlantic Charter guaranteed autonomy to all colonies. However, the Far Eastern countries discovered that this promise was only to give freedom to the white people under Nazi shackles, not to the brown people, nor to the Asians.

The Malays outside the Philippines do not talk about democracy. They only say, "We hope and seek to be granted 'America' to our people." This means a way of life in which brown people not only enjoy freedom but also respect and help each other with white people. The American government in the Philippines is the source of this idea. It clearly proves that the theory that imperialists consider overly ambitious and impractical is indeed feasible.

The Malay Federation Fights for Human Freedom

Imperialists believe that the organization of the Malay Federation will not be successful.

The first reason is that there is no unified basis among the various Malays. Although their languages all belong to the Malay root, they speak a variety of dialects. They often engage in infighting, which only stops after Westerners intervene. Their religions are also mutually antagonistic.

The second reason is that, according to actual records, the exploitation suffered by Easterners under native rulers far exceeds the exploitation they suffer under Westerners. Exorbitant taxes are levied, only to fill the pockets of the local emperors and satisfy their extravagance. For ordinary people, the courts are practically non-existent, and the police system also fails to protect them.

The third reason is that these backward nations are not

### Dried Longan Market Recovers Slightly

Due to the relatively abundant supply of dried longan, market prices have been declining. The price drop has exceeded half of the previous levels. Top-grade Quanzhou big-bubble longan once reached 25,000 yuan, and Xinghua dried longan also approached the 30,000 yuan mark. However, as the cost of goods procured later was higher, merchants inevitably suffered losses. Therefore, they mutually agreed to hold back and not sell, leading to a gradual improvement in the market. Yesterday, wholesalers in the northern part of the city released over two hundred items, resulting in a rebound of 1,500 yuan, and the market subsequently tightened.

Yesterday, a small amount of new dried longan meat was offered. The size and quality of the slices were up to standard, and the appearance was clean. The price was 70,000 yuan. Other ordinary goods were priced below 40,000 yuan.

### Glass Sells Well

The wartime state has passed, and reconstruction work is underway. Minor repairs are happening everywhere, especially window repairs, which are the most urgent. As a result, the sales of glass are booming, and prices are soaring. Thin glass sheets, 40 to 50 inches in size, sell for 20,000 yuan per box. Those around 60 inches are priced at 22,000 yuan. Thick glass sheets, 50 sheets of medium size (40 inches), sell for 23,000 yuan.

### Abundant Southern Supplies; Rice Shows Signs of Weakness; Flour and Soybean Oil Rise Slightly

The rice market has seen a large influx of supplies from the south, leading to sluggish sales in stores. Prices have declined by 100 to 200 yuan. White rice and Yin rice prices have also fallen by 300 to 400 yuan due to abundant supply. In the oil market, soybean oil is slightly weak, while raw tung oil remains firm. Flour prices continue to rise by over 100 yuan, but digestion in both northern and southern ports has slowed, leading to a stagnant market. Yellow beans have also decreased by 300 to 400 yuan due to weak demand in Quanzhou and Xinghua. Raw peanuts are performing well. Sesame is in short supply, and demand exceeds supply, causing prices to rise by over 1,000 yuan. Cottonseed cake is stable, while soybean cake lacks trading and remains unopened. The liquor market is active and sales are strong, leading to a further increase of 500 yuan.

### Taiwan Province Bans Sugar Exports to Exchange Sugar for Fertilizer

[Central News Agency, Taipei, 26th] Following the ban on private exports of sugar by the Taiwan Provincial Government, various parties have paid close attention. According to Governor Chen, Taiwan is known for its agricultural products such as grain and sugar. However, due to transportation disruptions and fertilizer shortages in recent years, production has declined sharply. If efforts are not made to increase grain production, there will not only be insufficient capacity to support the needs of the inland provinces in the future, but also a disruption in the supply within Taiwan. Therefore, increasing grain production in Taiwan currently relies on the import of fertilizer. To obtain fertilizer, the remaining sugar must be centralized for exchange. In addition to working with relevant parties to import large quantities of chemical raw materials from overseas, to generally encourage the supply of fertilizer, anyone or any merchant transporting ferrous sulfate or soybean cake to Taiwan can exchange it for sugar from the Taiwan Provincial Trading Company for export.

### Relief Wheat: 7,000 Bags Arrive in Shanghai

The British Far East Shipping Management Office's British ship "Paddle Mixis" [transliteration], carrying over six thousand seven hundred and thirty bags of American relief wheat, was expected to arrive in Shanghai yesterday. However, it had not arrived by late yesterday evening. According to a telegram from the management office, the ship is expected to arrive in Shanghai tomorrow (the 29th) and is scheduled to dock at buoys 31 and 32 for unloading.

### Fuel Market Remains Stable and Firm; White Coal Nuggets Continue to Rise

The coal market is generally stable without significant fluctuations. However, white coal nuggets are in immediate demand, leading to strong buying interest and gradually increasing prices. Recent arrivals at the firewood and charcoal docks are less than before. Although traders have sufficient stock, the cost of transporting goods from the docks to the warehouses adds 100 to 200 yuan, causing the market price to remain firm.

### Next Year's Revenue Budget

Approximately 2,054 Billion Yuan

The estimated national revenue budget for the next year is approximately 2,054 billion yuan. The tax revenue budget is still under discussion by the Ministry of Finance after multiple deliberations. It is reportedly around 730 billion yuan, including an estimated 94.4 billion yuan from land tax, 40 billion yuan from income tax, 30 billion yuan from inheritance tax, 132 billion yuan from commodity tax, 70 billion yuan from customs duties, and 100 billion yuan from revenue from enemy and puppet assets.

### Market News in Brief

Weaving mills producing 12-pound fine white cloth are actively resuming production. However, due to prolonged shutdowns, machinery has been damaged, and repairs are time-consuming, resulting in low production volume. Strong demand further exacerbates the situation.

Large quantities of dyes such as San Seng Yuan [transliteration], 833 Dantu Yuan [transliteration], black indigo powder, Shuang E Yuan [transliteration], and sodium sulfide are being absorbed by Tianjin and Hankou merchants, causing the market price to show a firm trend. However, customers are generally setting strict price limits, resulting in lower trading volume compared to yesterday.

Raw silk prices have risen along with the gold market, boosting confidence and strengthening the market. Wealthy households are actively purchasing high-grade factory silk, and silk fabric factories continue to procure supplies.

Cigarettes show a weakening trend, especially those produced by Yizhong. Lao Dao [transliteration] fell below 6,000 yuan in the afternoon. The prices of Chinese-made cigarettes vary.

Knitted goods show a slight downward trend in market prices. 32-count socks, ten-five socks, health shirts, and Queen health shirts have become popular items, with prices rising across the board.

### Central Bank Announces Next Year's Business Policy

According to Xu Baiyuan, Director of the Business Bureau of the Central Bank: (1) Regarding the Central Bank's business plan, the Central Bank's mission is to regulate finance, and the current work is proceeding according to the original policy. (a) Expedite the settlement of maturing gold savings; (b) Reduce exchange rates in recovered areas as much as possible; (c) Support commercial banks in operating legitimate businesses and provide banks with low exchange rates. The business plan for the next year has been completed and is being submitted to the highest authorities for approval. (2) Regarding the issue of revising foreign exchange rates, the highest authorities have an overall decision, and it is not convenient to announce it until it is mature. Whether the foreign exchange business will be handled by the Central Bank or divided among national banks is also unknown. (3) Supporting commercial banks in handling remittances has also begun. The exchange rate is 4%, and 20 excellent firms in Chongqing have been designated, each allowed to provide 100 million yuan of funds per week. The application requirements are: (a) having branches in Shanghai; (b) not engaging in speculation. This will facilitate financial communication between the two places and benefit the vitality of Chongqing's finance. (4) Regarding the establishment of institutions by the Central Bank in Northeast China and Taiwan, the primary goal is to stabilize the existing conditions in these areas. (a) The exchange rate between Northeast China currency and legal tender will be announced after the price levels in Northeast China and North China are balanced. (b) Remittances between Taiwan and the mainland will be temporarily handled using foreign exchange methods. (5) Regarding overseas remittances, in addition to the Bank of China actively clearing them, the Central Bank has allocated 7 billion yuan in funds to the Bank of China to clear backlogs. Since the victory, overseas remittances have increased sharply, to about 10 million US dollars per month. The Central Bank will adjust funds as appropriate to expedite the provision of overseas remittances, allocating approximately 5 billion yuan in national currency per month. The methods of transporting cash are: (a) overland from Chongqing; (b) by sea from Shanghai, both concentrated in Guangzhou for distribution.

Overseas Remittance Statistics

The Bank of China handles overseas remittances, and the figures are approximately as follows:

October Income Cumulative Amount for Ten Months

USD 5,467,000 13,491,000

GBP 67,000 2,184,000

INR 20,000 444,000

### Sun Lianzhong Concerned About Out-of-School Youths in North China

Invites Relevant Agencies to Discuss Seven Measures

[Central News Agency, Beiping, 26th] The relief of unemployed and out-of-school youths in various parts of North China has become an important issue in the reconstruction work. The Ministry of Education originally planned to provide relief to 10,000 youths nationwide, with 1,000 allocated to the Tianjin-Beiping area. Based on the actual situation, the number of unemployed and out-of-school youths in need of relief is much larger, far exceeding the 1,000 quota. Sun Lianzhong, Commander of the Eleventh War Zone, is extremely concerned about this issue. At 1:00 PM on the 26th, he specially invited representatives from education and other agencies to discuss relief measures, deciding on the following: (1) The relief quota is tentatively set at 5,000; (2) The required food will be discussed and allocated by the Tianjin-Beiping Municipal Government and the Hebei Provincial Government; (3) The required coal will be solicited from various coal mines by special commissioners of the Ministry of Economic Affairs; (4) The required salt will be allocated by the Commander's Office; (5) Clothing will be borrowed from the Commander's Office; (6) The Relief Sub-Bureau will request the General Bureau to allocate relief supplies for 5,000 youths; (7) During the winter break for students in Tianjin-Beiping schools, the Youth League will prepare a plan for students in need of relief and submit it to the Central Youth Headquarters to organize a winter camp.

### Ministry of Education Formulates Principles for the Reinstatement of National Middle Schools

[Our Newspaper, Chongqing] Regarding the reinstatement of national middle schools, the Ministry of Education has formulated several principles: (1) National middle schools will generally be handed over to the provinces and cities for management; (2) National middle schools with special circumstances will remain national for the time being. The location of the schools will be determined by the Ministry of Education; (3) In remote provinces with limited human and financial resources, where it is usually impossible to establish many excellent middle schools, the original national middle schools will continue to operate temporarily. National vocational schools and normal schools will remain in their original provinces or be relocated to suitable provinces for experimentation and environmental needs and will remain national for the time being.

### Shanxi University Resumes Classes in Hancheng This Month on the 24th

[Central News Agency, Taiyuan, 26th] National Shanxi University began its reinstatement after the liberation of Taiyuan. However, it was delayed for several months due to the destruction of the railway by the Communist army. It has been reported that the school resumed classes in Hancheng, Shaanxi, on the 24th.

### The Dispute Over the Property of the Puppet Central University Has Been Resolved

Central University and Jinling University Each Gets What it Wants

[Dahua News Agency, Nanjing] A dispute arose between the Central University's Nanjing Office Receiving Committee and Jinling University regarding the receiving of assets from the puppet Central University. The reason is that many of the assets and equipment of the puppet Central University were taken from Jinling University. Jinling University believed that since Jinling University and Central University have always been friendly, Central University could donate all the equipment to Jinling University. However, some of the equipment belonged to the former Central University, and some were added by the puppet Central University. Donating all of it was impossible. Moreover, the government designated Central University to receive the assets. In terms of law, Central University could have ignored Jinling University's request. Therefore, after repeated discussions, out of consideration for personal relations and past friendship, a solution was finally reached. All furniture and books were returned to Jinling University. The surveying instruments of the Department of Civil Engineering, the instruments and medicines of the Medical College's Hygiene Room, and the equipment for music and art were all received by Central University.

### Educational Losses in Zhejiang Province

Over 334 Billion Yuan

The total amount is 334,375,575,40 yuan, which has been reported to the Ministry of Education for record.

### North China Educational Receiving Work: 36 Receiving Institutions

[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 27th] The educational receiving work in Tianjin and Beiping has largely been completed. Henan Province is now beginning to receive. The personnel dispatched by the Ministry of Education for the educational receiving work in Hebei and Shandong Provinces will soon depart. There are 230 registered unemployed education personnel, who have been screened and employed by the review authorities. Special Commissioner Shen said: The institutions received by this office can be divided into three categories, totaling 36: (1) There are 17 educational administration and cultural institutions, including the Xinmin Printing House, which the Executive Yuan ordered to be taken over by the Ministry to rush print the Three Principles of the People and the nationally determined textbooks for primary and secondary schools to meet urgent needs. The Palace Museum, the History Museum, the Chinese Dictionary Compilation Office, and the North China Observatory have all been reinstated. Losses of antiquities include the removal of more than 60 bronze vats from the Palace Museum, which are currently being investigated. (2) There are 5 libraries, such as Tsinghua, Yenching, the Beiping Research Institute, the Beiping Library, and the Political Science Association, which were plundered by puppet organizations. This office is working to clear and return them. This work is confusing and complicated, and very heavy. (3) There are 14 puppet schools, including the North China Administrative College, which has been dissolved. Peking University and Central University have merged to form a temporary university preparatory class.

### Educational Comrades in Distress Organize a Friendship Association

The association's address is No. 107, Lane 591, Nanjing West Road. A meeting of directors and supervisors was convened the day before yesterday, and it was decided to compile a history of the deeds of the comrades in distress, and all members will be notified to send the materials to the association for compilation within the year. The association is scheduled to hold a fellowship meeting for members on the 9th floor of the YMCA, Baxianqiao, on January 2 next year. Those who have not joined the association can directly request a registration form from the association to complete the registration.

[Our Newspaper] The Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Education has recently formulated the "Provisional Measures for Reorganizing Private Vocational Schools and Vocational Supplementary Schools" as follows: (1) The registration and inspection measures for private vocational schools and vocational supplementary schools in this city are the same as those for secondary schools. (2) Unless otherwise specified in these measures, the "Provisional Measures for Reorganizing Private Secondary Schools" of this bureau shall apply to all private vocational schools and vocational supplementary schools in this city. (3) Private vocational schools that have already started operating without registration should complete the registration procedures in accordance with the law. However, to save procedures for schools that meet the prescribed standards, the procedures for the school board's registration, requesting approval to start operating, and requesting registration can be combined into one. (4) Private secondary schools that have already started operating without registration and want to change to vocational schools may also apply the provisions of the preceding article. (5) Private vocational supplementary schools that have already started operating without filing should complete the filing procedures in accordance with the law. (6) When registering a private vocational school, if it does not meet the standards due to limited environment and economic equipment, the bureau may first approve its registration and at the same time set a time limit for it to gradually improve the equipment. (7) This bureau may specially agree to allow public industrial institutions to allow private vocational schools and vocational supplementary schools to send staff and students for internships. (8) If there are technical or administrative difficulties in preparing a private vocational school's internship factory, it may request the bureau for assistance. (9) Private vocational schools or vocational supplementary schools with excellent performance and financial difficulties may request subsidies. (10) When students from private vocational schools or vocational supplementary schools graduate, they may request this bureau to forward letters to various public and private industrial institutions to employ them as much as possible. (11) These measures have been passed by the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Education's committee meeting and will be implemented. (Yuan)

### Morning Friends Cup Basketball Tournament: Two Group A Games Today; Donghua vs. Shantou Team; Green Forest vs. Desheng

The Morning Friends Cup Group A tournament will feature two games as usual, starting at 5:30 PM today. Although they may not be particularly exciting, the game between Donghua and Shantou is particularly attractive. The China Youth authorities, in view of this, have considered raising ticket prices.

The first game today is between Green Forest and Desheng. The former's attacking power has been reduced due to the injury of Chen Zhengsen. Although newcomer Hou Xueshi has joined the team, it is ultimately a losing proposition. Desheng should be able to win if they can field a full team.

Donghua and Shantou have similar styles, so they will fight fire with fire, and the clash will be fierce, making for a very watchable game. Today's schedule is as follows:

Green Forest - Desheng (Group A) 5:30 PM

Donghua - Shantou (Group A) 6:30 PM

### Standing Committee to be held. Basketball Committee Meeting Tomorrow

The Basketball Committee of the Municipal Sports Association is scheduled to hold its second standing committee meeting at You Yi Cun, Nanjing West Road, at 6:00 PM tomorrow (the 29th). It is reported that important matters will be discussed. Chairman Qian Xucang has several new plans to promote the comprehensive development of basketball in this city.

### A Plea for Children's Education

— Lu Dianyang

After the Anti-Japanese War, textbooks in the rear areas were mostly printed on locally produced paper. The paper quality was poor, and the printing was blurry. Even in the first grade of elementary school, the font, although large, was still unclear, and the illustrations were even uglier, making them unrecognizable, let alone enjoyable. Children in the rear areas read books printed on rough paper under dim vegetable oil lamps, and their eyes suffered significant damage after a few years. During the Aviation Committee's recruitment of new students, many young people failed the eye test. What a great sacrifice for the country!

Now that the war has ended victoriously, elementary schools in the rear areas are still using textbooks printed on rough paper. This is unreasonable. It is true that transportation has not yet been restored, and newspapers have not yet been transported to the rear areas, so elementary schools have no choice but to continue using textbooks printed on rough paper this semester. But what about next semester? I am afraid that children in the rear areas will not be able to enjoy textbooks printed on white paper next semester! We cannot but cry out for the education of children in the rear areas! Please save the children in the rear areas, and reduce the tonnage of cigarettes and cosmetics transported by river and replace it with white paper to Chongqing, dedicated to printing elementary school textbooks.

As for the recovered areas in the southeast, they have always used white paper to print textbooks, and children have never seen textbooks printed on rough paper, so it seems that there is no problem. However, after some investigation, it was found that textbooks are also in short supply in the recovered areas. As a result, some elementary schools still use enemy and puppet textbooks, and some use pre-war teaching materials or supplementary teaching materials, all of which are not suitable for the children's education in the new China. The United Publishing House, which is dedicated to supplying nationally determined textbooks, is suffering from not getting enough newspaper to print textbooks. It is said that there are many newspapers in the sealed warehouses in Shanghai, which are distributed to various newspapers and magazines for use, but the United Publishing House has not yet received any of these newspapers. It is said that the paper they use to print nationally determined textbooks is purchased from the black market at high prices, which will undoubtedly affect the quantity and timing of printing. Moreover, the cost of booksellers increases, and the price of books cannot be reduced, which will increase the burden on children. What about this semester, and what about next semester? I am afraid that even though many arms are long, children in the recovered areas may not be able to enjoy official-price white paper textbooks next semester. We cannot but cry out for the education of children in the recovered areas: Please save the children in the recovered areas, do not forget them, and do not let them read enemy and puppet textbooks again. The newspapers sealed in the warehouse should be distributed to the publishers printing nationally determined textbooks as soon as possible, limited to printing nationally determined elementary school textbooks, publishing books on schedule, and reducing the selling price. It is said that in the past, the enemy and puppets gave priority to "allocating" newspapers to print textbooks. Could it be that the current authorities do not attach as much importance to children's education as the enemy and puppets did? I think it will never be the case.

It is said that there are not many newspapers in stock in Shanghai, but the demand for textbooks is extremely high. Therefore, to cure the root cause, we believe that the government should help publishers order large quantities of newspapers from abroad, provide official exchange rates, reduce import tariffs, approve priority transportation, and then distribute them to various districts to print elementary school textbooks (the number of elementary school textbooks is fixed, and paper is allocated according to the planned number of copies, so there will be no corruption). In this way, the price of textbooks can be greatly reduced, and it will definitely be effective in promoting national education. The country seems to be worth doing this work related to children's education.

Who doesn't have children, and who doesn't hope that children will get beautiful, clear, and affordable textbooks? I am sure that this small suggestion of mine will receive the sympathy and support of relevant people and will be realized in the shortest possible time.

### British Insurance Company Statement: Scope of Responsibility to Policyholders; Regulations Applicable to Contracts During Enemy Occupation Periods to be Considered

This city's dispatch from the British Information Office: British insurance companies have issued a statement clarifying the handling of insured individuals in enemy-occupied territories during wartime. Shanghai has received this statement, which outlines the following principles:

(1) "Enemy-occupied territory" refers to areas that have never been at war with Britain but are designated as enemy territory under the "Trading with the Enemy Act" or similar legislation, or that are under enemy occupation even without such formal designation.

(2) "Technical enemies" refers to any individual or entity (whether incorporated or unincorporated) residing in enemy-occupied territory. The above statement applies only to fire, marine, aviation, and general insurance.

Insurance contracts are not considered void simply because the parties involved are "technical enemies," except as limited by the following provisions:

First, if the insured item is goods, those goods must never have been shipped to any government, individual, or company hostile to the United Kingdom or its allies, nor must they have become the property of such a government, individual, or company at any time during transport.

Second, losses or legal claims arising from capture, detention, restriction, or seizure by the United Kingdom or any allied government will not be covered by the insurance.

Third, if the insurance has been transferred to another insurance company, the British insurance company is released from its liability from the date of transfer.

Fourth, agreements signed in the United Kingdom during the enemy occupation will remain valid. However, the legal status of new contracts concluded within the occupied territory during the occupation period will be carefully considered by the company.

### Rickshaws on Nanjing Road to Resume Operation This Afternoon

### Supervising Inspector Cheng Concerned About People's Livelihood; Suggests Troops Should Not Directly Occupy People's Homes, and a Fundamental Solution to Local Finances Should be Expedited

The Jiangsu District Supervising Inspectorate dispatched multiple investigators to various areas of Jiangnan in the middle of this month. According to their reports, troops stationed along the Nanjing-Shanghai railway line mostly occupy civilian homes and borrow kitchens, causing disturbance to residents despite generally disciplined conduct. Supervising Inspector Cheng, concerned that this situation could negatively impact the public's respect for the national army, urgently recommended improvements to maintain good military-civilian relations. He suggested to the Jiangsu Provincial Government and the Third War Area Command that, regarding troop accommodation, the county government should oversee the selection of housing, working with local officials, regardless of the duration of stay. Furthermore, the county government should designate an agency to handle the procurement of supplies needed by the troops, who should liaise with the county government upon arrival, avoiding direct occupation of civilian homes to prevent disturbances. Additionally, according to recent investigations by the Supervising Inspectorate, the materials and expenses required for the area pacification measures decided by the Jiangsu Province Security Conference, such as road construction, telephone installation, bridge restoration, bunker construction, establishment of Baojia system, and census taking, all are derived from local support. Local areas are also providing food for troops, and are directed to procure goods before the military station arrives. Administrative personnel have no travel funds. Supervising Inspector Cheng believes the burden on the people in Jiangsu Province counties has been increasing since their recovery, with unlimited assessments. The above pacification expenses, nominally from local support, are actually burdens on the people. He specifically suggested to the Supreme National Defense Council that local funding should not be lightly ordered until the uses have been presented for approval. He also asked the central government to be considerate of the people's plight, and to expedite a fundamental solution to local finances in the next year, to give respite to the people of Jiangsu and lay the foundation for local administration.

### Hawaiian Version of U.S. Dollar Bills Should Not Be Devalued

Hawaiian version U.S. dollar bills are widely circulated in this city, but money changers intentionally suppress their value, reducing the exchange rate by two percent compared to regular U.S. dollar bills. This came to the attention of the U.S. military finance office at Ford Island. Yesterday, they issued a notice stating that the Hawaiian version U.S. dollar bills have the same value as other U.S. dollar bills, and U.S. military and civilians should not transact with anyone deliberately devaluing them.

### Electricity Rate Increase Under Consideration

[Our Reporter] It was recently learned from relevant parties that the issue of increasing electricity rates in the city is still under consideration. Although the Shanghai Power Company submitted a request to the Municipal Bureau of Public Utilities earlier this month to adjust electricity prices, the Ministry of Economic Affairs is currently in charge of electricity administration. Therefore, all electricity administration measures are subject to comprehensive discussion to facilitate reasonable adjustments. Currently, the Shanghai Power Company needs 700 tons of coal and approximately 350 tons of oil daily to maintain power generation. Due to the high prices and difficult sources of fuel, the cost is enormous, making it difficult for the company to balance its income and expenses. To consider the facts, the authorities may adjust the rates. Reportedly, the authorities intend to maintain the original price of 12 yuan per kilowatt-hour for ordinary small users within the old limit of 10 kilowatt-hours. However, the electricity rates for industrial and general electric heating, which account for 70-80% of the city's electricity consumption, may be adjusted appropriately to provide financial support. It is also rumored that the company initially required an average of four pounds of coal to generate one kilowatt-hour during the early stages of resumption. Now, with improved machine maintenance, the amount of coal required to generate one kilowatt-hour has been reduced to slightly less than three pounds. Therefore, if fuel supply improves, the adjustment of electricity prices may not be too significant. Furthermore, the company has implemented an additional security deposit starting this month. The amount of the fee is based on each household's electricity consumption, roughly equivalent to the electricity bill for the past month plus 50%. It is said that the purpose of this additional security deposit is to ensure that users pay their bills on time. The company requires one and a half months from meter reading and sending bills to users paying their outstanding electricity fees before the deadline. Therefore, the additional security deposit is charged at 50% of the previous month's electricity bill.

### Tram Company Labor Dispute Still Under Negotiation

(Our Report) Drivers, ticket collectors, track maintenance, and mechanics of the British Tram Company are demanding the company to improve their treatment and increase wages.

However, the content is still under careful discussion by the representatives, so the request has not yet been submitted to the company, and the Bureau of Social Affairs has not received any notice. It is learned that the workers are demanding a minimum base salary of 26 yuan per month, in accordance with the minimum standard set by the Bureau of Social Affairs. The current minimum base salary for workers is only about 10 yuan, a difference of more than one and a half times, so there is still room for negotiation. It is also learned that the collective dismissal of five ticket collectors by the company has been resolved satisfactorily through impartial mediation by the Bureau of Social Affairs.

### The Origins of the Death of a Gambler in a Gambling Den on Rue Ratard

[Our Report] Yu Xunren, director of the Changning Police Precinct on Rue Paul Henry Brénan, received a tip at approximately 9:30 PM the night before last that No. 49 Kangfuli, a branch of Rue Ratard, was a gambling den (commonly known as a "Yellow Ox Pen"). He ordered the police to investigate and bust the den, during which a gambler was shot and killed, as reported in our newspaper. According to those in charge, the residents there are all local thugs, most of whom do not engage in legitimate work and live off smoking and gambling. Their gambling dens are particularly cunning, often moving several times a night, making it difficult for the police to bust them. The night before last (the 25th), after receiving a tip, he immediately ordered Judicial Section staff member Xu Xianzong to lead four plainclothes police officers and six armed police officers to the scene in a police car. First, he ordered the plainclothes police officers to blend in with the gamblers and enter the den. They then arrested all 18 gamblers along with the gambling equipment and funds and escorted them onto the police car at the Yuangfang Lane entrance. Unexpectedly, Xu A-Si was grabbed by Xu Section staff member Xu and pulled forward. When he reached the lane entrance, the suspect turned around and suddenly struck his right arm, snatched his official pistol, and dragged Xu into the lane, causing Xu to injure his right hand. He then called for his companions for assistance and took out his pistol, accidentally triggering the mechanism. A shot rang out, hitting A-Si in the rear arm, piercing his right waist, and causing him to fall to the ground bleeding. He died shortly after being sent to the hospital. According to reports, the deceased, Xu A-Si, was actually Qian Ai-Chu, a local resident, 45 years old, and a well-known local thug and disciple of Zhu Shunlin. He had committed numerous crimes in the jurisdiction and had a record of them. Furthermore, the 18 gamblers arrested were not good citizens and have been sent to the District Procuratorate for severe punishment.

### Zhoujiazui Road Wasteland: Japanese Corpse Discovered; Murderer Takagi Tadashi Arrested and Confesses

[Our Dispatch] At approximately 7:50 AM on the 20th, the Tilanqiao Police Station received a report from Japanese national Ota Yoshihei, stating that a Japanese corpse had been discovered on the wasteland behind the back door of No. 19, Lane 416, Zhoujiazui Road. Section Chief Zhang and Deputy Section Chief Wang Xiweng immediately led Justice Section Chief Shi Rongrong to investigate. The investigation determined that the deceased had indeed been strangled. However, the body was not covered in mud, and the feet were without shoes, leading to the conclusion that the body had been moved. There were no belongings on the deceased, only a tattered piece of paper in his pocket, which read "Yamamoto Sadaji, residing at No. 12, Lane 144, Huoshan Road." They proceeded to the address for investigation. According to Yamamoto, the piece of paper was indeed written by him, but he claimed to have forgotten to whom he had given it. Yamamoto was then taken to identify the body, and it was learned that the deceased was a former captain of the "puppet China Shipping Company," but the surname and address were unknown. After extensive investigation by the police station, it was discovered that the deceased's name was Matsushita Tokio, aged forty, residing at No. 3, Xinkang Li, Wuchang Road. A search of his residence revealed that it was empty, leading to the conclusion that this was a murder for gain. A Japanese neighbor, Miyake Uta, was brought back for questioning, and she stated that at 3:30 PM on the 19th, a Japanese man, aged approximately twenty, holding a wine bottle, had come to visit Matsushita, who invited him to dinner. She claimed to know nothing further. It was then discovered that a Japanese man named Harada, residing at No. 3, Dexing Fang, Dong Changzhi Road, seemed to be holding items of clothing, etc., for someone. Investigation revealed two leather suitcases containing Matsushita's suit and captain's uniform hat, etc. According to Harada, a friend named Takagi Tadashi had come to deposit them at 7:00 PM that evening, and he said that Takagi Tadashi, aged about twenty-three or twenty-four, lived at No. 40, Xin'an Fang, Huimin Road. Based on this, the murderer seemed to be Takagi Tadashi. Officers were dispatched to the address, and according to his roommate, Japanese national Minami Taiichi, Takagi had a fondness for alcohol and women, and his character was immoral. At approximately 1:00 PM on the 19th, he had returned home once, holding a woman's black leather boot containing a large amount of counterfeit money. At the same time, he had told him that if anyone came looking for him, he should pretend that he had already moved. It was determined that the murderer was indeed Takagi Tadashi. Three photos of Takagi were found in the room. Officers were stationed at both locations, while detectives were dispatched to entertainment venues and restaurants. At 5:00 PM yesterday afternoon, a report was received that someone resembling Takagi Tadashi was drinking at the Yatuan Cafe at No. 172, Xingjiaqiao Road. Justice Section Chief Shi personally led police officers to arrest him. He confessed that he and the deceased, Matsushita, had both been employees of the China Shipping Company, and that due to financial difficulties, he had strangled him and used a three-wheeled vehicle to move the body to the wasteland behind the back door of No. 19, Lane 416, Zhoujiazui Road. The police station is now rigorously interrogating him to determine if he had any accomplices or other illegal activities.

### Jealousy Spree: Prostitute Stabbed

Yesterday at approximately 3:30 PM, a man named Jia, from Jiangwan, was chatting in her room when Zhang arrived. Upon seeing the situation, he was consumed by jealousy and became enraged. He asked Meigeng if she was going out, and she replied that she was not. Zhang then took out two packets of white powder from his pocket and swallowed them. He then pulled out a sharp blade and, without explanation, stabbed her head and face several times. Meigeng was injured and fled to the home of Chen Chunbao on the second floor of the back building. Zhang Jinfu followed her and rushed inside, continuing to stab her arms and other areas more than ten times, severing two fingers on her right hand, causing profuse bleeding. A customer in the room was also stabbed in the head and immediately went to seek medical attention. Meigeng's sister, Mao'er, was also stabbed twice in the right hand. Realizing the magnitude of his crime, the murderer abandoned the weapon and fled. The North Station Police Station was notified and dispatched officers to investigate.

### Former HSBC Bank Employee Sentenced for Privately Opening Boxes

The current rickshaw union believes that these rickshaws should be confiscated and specifically requests the competent authorities to confiscate them according to the law and then hand them over to the union for responsible use. The total number of rickshaw pullers in this city is more than 60,000, while the total number of rickshaws is only 18,000. Apart from those who pull every other day, there are still 16,000 to 17,000 unemployed.

### Relief Administration Flat-Priced Flour: Second Phase of Sales Begins Today; Procedure Changed, Registration Held First

The Executive Yuan's Relief Administration's first phase of flour sales in this city (December 13, 14, 15, and 17) sold a total of 44,980 bags. Now, due to market demand, a second phase of sales is being held. However, the procedure has been slightly changed. Starting from the 21st of this month, registration will be held first, followed by the announcement of prices and sales. A total of 4,356 businesses have registered, including 940 retailers, 1,620 wholesalers, 740 noodle makers, 950 noodle and snack shops, and 106 bakeries. The amount of flour requested by each business varies, with 10 bags, 20 bags, and 50 bags each. The total number of bags requested is 100,230. The number of bags requested by consumer cooperatives is not included. The price of this sale will remain the same as the first phase, which should be able to meet the demand. The administration has decided to start selling today (28th).

Medical Equipment Will Continue to Be Shipped to Shanghai

Post-war medical care plays a very important role in China's relief plan. The Executive Yuan's Relief Administration (行總) has requested a large amount of medical and health equipment from the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (聯總). As of yesterday, only 215 tons of medical and health equipment had arrived in Shanghai, and a large quantity will continue to be shipped to China. Recently, smallpox has been prevalent in Hankou. The Relief Administration transported 300,000 doses of smallpox vaccine from Shanghai and Chongqing to Hankou a month ago to prepare for it. However, the general public is accustomed to thinking that smallpox is only prevalent in the spring, and there is no need to vaccinate in the winter. In fact, the season in which smallpox is most likely to be prevalent is autumn and winter, thus evolving into the current situation in Hankou. The administration hopes that the general public will correct their mistaken views and get vaccinated voluntarily to avoid the spread of disease. According to recent news, diphtheria has been discovered in Guangdong, but the number is small. The Relief Administration has transported 100 doses of diphtheria serum to Guangdong for emergency relief. Penicillin has also begun to be distributed, and its distribution policy is: 1. Hospitals or institutions that receive penicillin from the Relief Administration must not charge patients when using it. 2. It must not be used to treat venereal diseases. 3. After use, doctors must report the process of use to the administration.

Zhejiang-Fujian Public Office Decides to Establish in Hangzhou

Sun Xiaolou, Director of the Zhejiang-Fujian Branch of the Executive Yuan's Relief Administration, flew from Chongqing to Shanghai the day before yesterday. Yesterday, he told reporters that the Zhejiang-Fujian Branch has found the Hangzhou Youth Association as its office address and that Deputy Director Zhu Xiujue is arranging everything. It will be established and operating in early January. An office will be established in Fuzhou in Fujian. Sun plans to wait for the branch staff to arrive in Shanghai from Chongqing before going to Zhejiang and Fujian to preside over the branch affairs. According to Sun, the Zhejiang and Fujian regions are vast and populous, and the war damage suffered is particularly great. Post-war relief work is urgently needed. I will be based on international policies on the one hand, and on the other hand, based on actual needs, to make rapid, fair, and universal distribution of relief. Currently, more than 30 foreign experts are assisting in planning in Taozhou, and another 70 or 80 will come east one after another to jointly design active relief services.

### "Moonlight Sonata" and Appreciation of Music

— Song Shouchang

Works of art, such as paintings and sculptures, have physical forms that exist in space and can be appreciated through sight or touch. Various comparisons can be made from the lines, shapes, colors, and composition, causing a resonance in the heart. Music is not like this. The materials that constitute it are only vast and empty sounds, cleverly connected to express thoughts and feelings in a direct and unrestrained way, unconstrained by objective or specific images. Therefore, music has become an elusive art. This special abstractness of art is unique to music in all the arts.

There is also music that imitates natural sounds, but the description of objective phenomena is ultimately of low interest. Therefore, there is "program music" that combines objective and subjective descriptions. More advanced is pure subjective descriptions, such as psychological descriptions and dramatic descriptions. Works such as "symphonic poems," "tone poems," and "musical dramas" can be used, all of which are expressions of the author's silk-like inner self. If we want to understand the content of music, we should imagine it with our own emotions and subjectivity.

For example, let’s take the world’s most popular "Moonlight Sonata." This music was originally dedicated by Beethoven to his lover Guilette, and the content depicts the anxiety and illusion of passionate love. In order to arouse the public’s interest in music, the publisher deliberately titled this music "Moonlight." In order to explain the content of the music, a story was created, saying that one night, Beethoven was walking in the suburbs, and a blind rural woman was playing the piano under the moonlight by the window. Beethoven described the scene under the moonlight and played this music. Under the suggestion of this title, when we listen to the Moonlight Sonata, it seems that we are in the moonlight.

The first movement of the Moonlight Sonata is slow, with a hazy mood, like the first rise of the moonlight; the second movement is brisk, suggesting clarity, like the bright moon hanging in the sky; the last movement is rapid and intense, like a midnight storm. The publishing industry titled it "Moonlight," which seems to barely conform to the content of the music. However, the modern Russian musician Rubinstein criticized the inappropriate title of the Moonlight Sonata. He believed that the expression of moonlight should be hazy, dreamy, peaceful, and calm in order to conform. The first movement of the Moonlight Sonata is completely sad, and the last movement is in violent passion, which is contrary to the peaceful and calm mood of the moonlight.

Regarding the Moonlight Sonata, some say that it was inspired by the clumsy poem "Praying Virgin" by Zoimei. Czerny once heard the Moonlight Sonata as a nocturne of ghosts appearing. Cornelius once heard the Moonlight Sonata as a description of the Gothic Church. These associations are not impossible. Because music is the abstract and inner expression of the author, when we listen to music, what our feelings are and what we associate with is everyone’s freedom.

### Gorky's "The Lower Depths"

— Zhao Jingshen

Ke Lingshi's adaptation and translation of Gorky's "The Lower Depths" has been directed by Zuo Lin and performed at the Lafayette Theater for several days. This is a good play after "The Circus." Jin Buhuan and Murong Tianxi are equally unpromising, and still played by Shi Hui. Shi Yuan still plays a role who likes to tell jokes with a giggle. (I think maybe it was in "Qiu Haitang") I remember seeing Lin Zhen's play in a play that insinuated Yuan Shikai. I have a deep impression of her fighting with another fat woman on stage. Zhang Fa is probably still playing the leading young man, just like in "The Circus." Su Qin seems to have been seen in "The Legend of the Eight Immortals". In short, almost all the people I saw on stage were familiar people. I have been away from Shanghai for two years, and when I come back, I still see the Kugan Drama Society continue to work hard. This spirit is really admirable. I heard that in the past few years, I have written dozens of play reviews, most of which were published under the pen name Zou Xiao in the Shenbao Recreation World. Because I took an attitude of appreciation, said more good things, gave more encouragement, and didn't criticize much, I was ridiculed as a "well-rounded play reviewer." But I have to state that I am an honest person, and everything I say comes from the bottom of my heart. I said what I wanted to say. "The Lower Depths" is the first drama I saw after returning to Shanghai, and I am now writing a seemingly right but actually wrong play review.

Danny played Dr. Ding in "Metamorphosis," and I once cheered for her. Her play moved me to tears, and I hope to take a section and include it in the Mandarin textbook. This time I am worried about her. How can such a gentle maternal woman play a hysterical woman? As a result, it was beyond my expectation that she succeeded. Naturally, the actions she showed, using the scarf to quickly tighten and release it, reminded me of "Carmen" (written by French Merimee) on the screen, as if she was a passionate Spanish woman; it also reminded me of "Salome" (written by British Wilde), and I always felt that it had a foreign flavor. But I have never seen what the actions of this type of Chinese woman are, so I can't say.

There is one place where I think the director did a very good job. That is when Ama is dying, Grandpa Quan tells her about the joys of heaven, saying that there will be someone to pick her up. At this time, Ama is holding Grandpa Quan's crutch, as if she has really been picked up to heaven. This suggestion strengthens my image. This crutch has replaced the glue, and such treatment is very clever.

Shi Tuo mentioned Sai Guanyin in his dedication, and he seemed to think that she was a poor person, and asked us to answer: "Why is she so cruel?" I think what he wants us to answer is his own words: "The power of society is greater, and they are thrown down deeper." But we don’t know what Sai Guanyin’s life was like before, for example, whether she was tricked into marrying or forcibly bought by Wen Taishi. Therefore, we only have disgust for her and no sympathy. Of course, Wen Taishi is the most annoying. But for Sai Guanyin, I can’t see her sadness, except for the pain of being in love and becoming neurotic as a result. What I mean is that her past should be recounted in a few sentences. What I like the most is Grandpa Quan. He has a heart of universal love and is enthusiastic about saving people. He knows that some things are superstitious or unreliable, but he is unwilling to break other people's dreams, but echoes them. Su Qin's performance is also excellent. There is also such a prophet in "The Circus" who tells fortunes (Xu Zhimo's "Bian Zhonggang" also has one), but not as lovely as Grandpa Quan.

Shi Tuo and Ke Ling's adaptation and translation have enough Chinese flavor. For example, it is most taboo to have someone reading a book behind you when playing card games, because the sound of "book" is the same as the sound of "lose." This is a kind of Chinese "taboo".

There is a passage in the play where Gao Xiaoou sings "Full of Grievances" in the opera "Selling Horses." The expression is very good and can express the state of pain, but the singing seems to lack the desolation.

### Short Notes

— Lan Tian

Returning from the Theater

Coming out of the bustling theater, one can't help but feel a little dizzy. Thousands of people were immersed in the modern "sound" and "color," forgetting the cold air outside. At the time, these movies gave the audience an unparalleled feeling of excitement, but after thinking about it, it was all empty. Truly, it was the height of splendor, ultimately tending towards blandness.

Walking in the silky drizzle, endlessly lost.

Standing at the tram stop, gazing out at the people coming and going at the intersection, hurrying to come, hurrying to go. Where do they come from? Where are they going? Although the road wasn't too deserted, the streetlights were dim, making it feel quite desolate. In the distance, a tram arrived, bringing a glimmer of hope. But the tram was incredibly crowded, a strange sight – how could such a small vehicle fit so many people? I was about to wait for the next tram, but then I thought, wouldn't it be just as crowded? Besides, being squeezed in a crowd can somewhat dispel the overwhelming feeling of loneliness. (Imagine how pitiful I am!)

Returning home, the room was very cluttered. These things seemed familiar, yet also very distant. As I started to tidy them up, my movements would suddenly stop, and I would yearn for the state of this room not long ago. It was raining outside, and I thought of you, having to run to two places, feeling very uneasy.

Recently, Li Yi's lines of poetry seem to be very fashionable. I see them here and there. Just now, on the way, I suddenly recalled two lines: "Red buildings stand cold, glimpsed through rain, beaded blinds sway, returning alone." Very fitting to the surroundings. Actually, the following two lines are also good, but the tone is a bit too desolate. He says: "On a distant road, one should grieve the lateness of spring, in the lingering night, one still vaguely recalls dreams." Reading these more often cultivates my emotions to be more exquisite. Isn't it?

### I Sing of Jiangnan

— Deng Lin

Jiangnan, this bright and beautiful water region of Jiangnan, has evoked so many memories and yearnings in people!

Jiangnan left me with rich spring dreams, and Jiangnan also left me with indelible traces. In my conscious memories, Jiangnan has given me much sorrow!

I remember gazing out from the majestic seaside. The vast sea's surging waves were so magnificent. Sometimes, the setting sun cast a sky full of evening glow, and the mountainside shimmered with shades of purple and emerald. Soft clouds floated over the mountain peaks, capturing the reflected, dazzling rays of light and carrying them towards the misty void, towards the vast expanse of water. At the edge of the sky, it left its last life behind, far away. Only the boundless sea still silently surged forward. From ancient times to the present, from the high mountains to the plains, it is always so silently, silently, harboring a full heart of ambition, passing the long, drawn-out night, even though the fleeting moment of light has abandoned it!

I remember gazing under the green curtains of bright lamps. On starry, moonlit nights, I imagined the future with my friends. The cold, beautiful orchids in front of the window emitted a faint fragrance. Where has it disappeared to now? Sometimes, the faint sound of a flute drifted from the lonely willow lanes, so melancholic and sad. Perhaps someone was yearning for the forging of life? Deep into the night, under the clear light of the bright moon, the cuckoos played a touching homesick tune, as if calling out to travelers in distant lands, "Better to return! Better to return!"

I also remember the ancient, gnarled pines on the small hills, and the maple leaves, as lush and vibrant as red flowers. How many people have wandered here, how many have smiled here. The post-calamity scenery must no longer be so beautiful! Perhaps thickets of wild weeds have replaced its former splendor. Eight years, eight years of devastation have buried countless tears of blood, and eight years of devastation have added countless lamentations!

I further remember the stream by the building, the pond by the embankment... Listening to the surging, angry sounds, the tides of the sea should still be a spectacle of the universe.

The car body speeds forward with a clattering sound, and the vast Jiangnan line reappears before my eyes. The vast sky, the towering green mountains... It is still young, only bearing a slight hint of excessive weariness!

The motherland's fields appear ahead. The sunlight illuminates the future, and Jiangnan begins a new life in its brilliance.

### Jiangnan Beyond the Border (Rhyming)

— Gu Yiqiao

Beautiful jade has long been nurtured, unintentionally seeking exploration. The white snow of the southern mountains accumulates in layered mists, snow water drawn into threads, threads of purity, mulberry trees spread across the land. Discussing past and present, facing the shadow, becoming three, a dream lightly dozing on the flat sands, for the dream of Jiangnan, seeking beyond the border, Jiangnan beyond the border.

### Obtaining Warmth

— Wu Yiren

When the northwest wind assaults all the meager warm clothes one is wearing, one's whole body instantly loses its warmth. It seems that one's heart is also frozen there. At this time, how you long for a warm place to restore the warmth you have lost, and to revive your freezing heart! But you are wrong to have such hope. Those who enjoy warmth will never think of the pain of those who have lost warmth, because they themselves have never tasted the bitterness of losing warmth, so they will not understand those pains. Even if they know, they will only feel a very slight sentiment. Thus, the "sympathy" you hope for will be hoped for forever.

Friend! Waiting for the sympathy of others is unreliable. Everything depends on yourself. You must work hard yourself, to obtain warmth for your whole body, and to revive your frozen heart. You only have to run desperately, and desperately make your whole body active. Then, your blood will flow through your whole body, and even sweat will pour from your pores. At this time, the "warmth" you have been waiting for will come. That is warmth obtained by your own strength. It will not run away and will always be your own.

If, when you always hope for people to sympathize with you, you are lucky enough to be led to a warm place by someone sympathetic, and then your whole body gains warmth, but may I ask, can you stay there forever? If you cannot, then this warmth is only temporary and will still be lost when you leave.

Friend! "It is better to ask for help from oneself than from others." This is an old saying from the ancients: the only warmth is to strike it out from the motor you possess.

Only cold can stir up your courage to run,

Only hardship will strengthen your spirit of struggle.

### The Story of a Drawing

— Murong Sui

It's been seven or eight years, not short, but not too long either! I used to be an elementary school teacher. Although the years have passed, I wasn't lonely. I feel like there were many "stories" worth remembering.

I'm not lying, I even served as a drawing teacher. I remember one day, I drew—originally intending to draw a tiger—a dog on the blackboard. Let's just say it was a dog! I had dozens of snot-nosed elementary school students copy it on their drawing pads.

But what was the result? When I collected the papers and carefully reviewed them, I found that only a few, two or three, of the dozens of papers had drawings that looked somewhat like a dog. What about the rest? Some looked like cows, some like pigs, some like rabbits, some like mice, some like... practically any four-legged animal had a place!

At the time, I just felt that these brilliant works, except for not one that "appropriately" resembled a tiger, could be considered a "grand spectacle," "a sight to behold!"

I began to realize that the development of talent should not be restricted, but should be encouraged to develop according to their "interests." So next time, I assigned a "topic" like this, telling them to draw a four-legged animal according to their imagination, any animal, as long as it had four legs!

But the result was truly beyond expectation. Although all the dozens of "works" were adorned with four legs, not one looked like an animal. Looking closely, some looked like "tables," some like "chairs"—at least they didn't forget the tail that an animal should have—I couldn't help but laugh a little at the time!

Thinking about it now, laugh? That would be a bit cruel. You should know that drawing an animal isn't an easy thing either!

### Map and Explanation of the Five Sacred Mountains, Eight Dynasties, Kunlun, and the Himalayas

— Yuan Xiluo

In this map, the lower right shows a cypress tree planted by my ancestor, the Yellow Emperor Xuanyuan, more than 4,600 years ago. The left shows the scenery of Hainan Island, with coconut trees and tropical plants. Slightly above are three mountains arranged in a row. The left is Mount Li in Hainan, the middle is Mount Luofu in Guangdong Province, and below the mountain is a plum forest, symbolizing China's national flower. To the right is Mount Jigong, the location where the decision for the War of Resistance was made. In the pine forest is a temple-style building, the place for the meeting. Further above, five mountains are arranged in a row: Hengshan (North), Taishan (East), Songshan (Central), Huashan (West), and Hengshan (South), the Five Sacred Mountains of China, known as North, South, East, West, and Central. Further above, two mountains, one is Mount Kumgang in Korea, the mountain where Japan began its invasion of my tributary state in the Sino-Japanese War, and the other is Mount Emei in Sichuan, the mountain in the rear of my wartime capital, Chongqing. Further up, to the left is Mount Changbai in Manchuria, in the middle is Mount Tianshan in Xinjiang, and to the right is Mount Diancang in Yunnan. The mountain peaks are all above the perpetual snow line. At the top, to the left is Kunlun, and to the right is a high peak, the Himalayas, both showing their halves, all covered in snow. The sky above is painted with the blue sky and white sun, dyed with auspicious red clouds, as a symbol of my country's flag. The creation of this map is for my

Comrade Chiang Kai-shek, for leading our countrymen for eight years in the war of resistance against the Japanese army that invaded our country, to protect my Republic of China, completely intact, to comfort his hard work and great achievements. When I was thirty-one years old, I joined the Tongmenghui (Revolutionary Alliance), following my

The late Premier Sun Yat-sen, running about for the revolution. In the autumn and winter of the Xinhai Revolution, I served as a representative of Jiangsu Province, organizing the Provisional Government of the Republic of China. Together with representatives from seventeen provinces, we elected Mr. Sun Yat-sen as the first President of the Republic of China. On the first day of the year, I, together with comrades Lin Zichao, Chen Taoyi, Wang Liangchen, Ju Juesheng, Ma Junwu, Wang Rutang, Wu Tiecheng, and gentlemen Lei Jixing, Gu Zhongxiu, and Qu Wenliu, bestowed the seal of the Great President upon Mr. Sun Yat-sen. At that time, we all joyfully danced and sang, thinking that my Republic of China would have great hope in the future. However, in less than two months, Mr. Sun Yat-sen ceded his position to Yuan Shikai. From then on, for more than ten years, Shikai's dictatorship lasted four years, and the warlords stole power for ten years. Mr. Sun Yat-sen struggled for forty years, but the revolution was not fully accomplished before his death. I deeply regret that I, as one of the old party members, was unable to help the revolution. Comrade Chiang Kai-shek, after fourteen years, continued Mr. Sun Yat-sen's will and worked hard on the Northern Expedition to unify China. This is truly the first person of my party and country. Now, after eight years of bloody battle, he has placed the Republic of China among the world's four great allied nations. I know that the spirit of the late Premier Sun Yat-sen in heaven will surely have something to comfort him, so I made this map to present to him. In my youth, I liked to make landscape paintings. After the age of thirty, I ran about in education and political work, and did not make this. I have stopped writing for nearly forty years. In 1938, I took refuge in Shanghai. I intended to go west with my old comrade, Chen Taoyi, to participate in the anti-Japanese work. Taoyi told me: The government today needs to gather talents from all sides to be effective in the war of resistance. If we go, we will occupy a position, and the government will have one less position to place talent. It is better to stay in Shanghai and not lower our aspirations, not insult our bodies, and be an example for the people in the occupied areas. Isn't that better than going to Chongqing? So we agreed not to move, and my brother Xilian also agreed with this decision. However, in less than three years, our funds were exhausted, and all three of us earned a living by selling books. Friends saw that I could paint in my youth and advised me to paint. So I took up the paintbrush again. In the autumn of 1943, I began to paint. At that time, I thought that the Himalayas were the highest mountain in my country and the highest mountain in the world, with hot, temperate, and cold climates. No Chinese painter had painted it before. I jokingly made several paintings to exchange for firewood and rice. At that time, thinking of the hard work of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek in the War of Resistance, I often made a painting to give to him on the day of his successful return to the capital. But the building where I lived was small, and there was no large painting table, so I could not make a large painting. So I bought a three-foot piece of silk in preparation. By May of this year, the world war was about to end, and it was predicted that the Chinese government would return to Nanjing in less than three months. So in mid-June, I started work. Also, because there are so many famous mountains in China, if I only painted one Himalayas, it would be monotonous, so I changed to make this map, painting the cypress tree planted by the Yellow Emperor, representing the national system of my country. Painting Kunlun as the source of all the mountains in my country. The Himalayas are the highest, also a branch of Kunlun. If we speak in terms of the symbolism of my party and country, then Kunlun is the late Premier Sun Yat-sen, and the Himalayas is Comrade Chiang Kai-shek. Painting Mount Kumgang is because Japan began its invasion of my country there, for the struggle of Korea. Now that Japan has been defeated, Korea has gained independence and will still be my eastern tributary. Painting the Five Sacred Mountains and other mountains to show the greatness of China, and also symbolizing the meritorious comrades of this War of Resistance. The brushwork sometimes follows Nangong (Mi Fu), sometimes follows Beiyuan (Dong Yuan), sometimes follows Ma Yuan, or imitates Xiangguang (Dong Qichang), while also referring to Western European watercolors. When the painting was completed, Chen Taoyi inscribed the words. Also, on the Double Seventh Festival of the year Yimao (1945), Mr. Yu Zhigan gave me a stone, tightly carved with a Liu Hai sprinkling gold coins ornament, with the inscription: "Peace under Heaven." That evening, Japan surrendered. So I instructed Zhu Fanru to carve the "Treasure Seal of Peace under Heaven" on the painting. Briefly record the intention of making the painting, written on another piece of paper at the top of the painting.

August, the 34th year of the Republic of China (1945), Yuan Xiluo respectfully painted and recorded, at the age of seventy.

### Why Are Children Not Allowed Into Movie Theaters in This City?

— Ruo Xuan

Movies are originally one of the legitimate entertainments for citizens, but the movie theaters in this city, in order to prevent children from developing bad habits, do not admit children under the age of ten. This reason always feels very forced. If it is really to prevent children from developing bad habits, then does that mean that children over the age of ten and adults will definitely not be affected after watching them? Moreover, the authorities have already established a film censorship committee, and any bad films that are obscene or promote theft can be banned from being shown at all. To stop eating because of choking is definitely not the way to go. At the same time, the Chinese and foreign films currently being shown in various theaters mostly promote the educational awareness of the War of Resistance and war stories. Children will not only not be harmed after watching them, but they can also increase their knowledge of war and make them aware of how cruel and unreasonable the enemy used to be. At the same time, it also makes us think that other countries do not have a ban on children entering movie theaters, and the bad habits of those children may not be as many as those of our children. For this reason, I hope that the authorities will immediately order all movie theaters to abolish the "rule that children are not allowed to enter."

(Editor's Note) It cannot be said that movie theaters have no reason to prohibit children from entering, because young children often cry and shout in the theater, which hinders the audience's hearing and public order. It should indeed be refused. I think it should be limited by the age of school entry, that is, children under the age of six are generally not admitted, and children over the age of six who have slightly opened their minds can be allowed to increase their new knowledge. I hope that the authorities and the movie theater industry can discuss this together.

### On Worry-Free Smoking Cessation (3)

— Hu Qipeng

IV. The Damage of Drug Addiction to the Human Body

Those who use addictive drugs often experience the aforementioned withdrawal symptoms when the required amount is insufficient or stopped, causing unbearable pain and lifelong suffering, which is beyond description. At the same time, their bodies and minds are gradually damaged unconsciously. The most obvious is that digestive problems occur in the stomach and intestines, leading to habitual constipation, affecting the body's metabolism, resulting in malnutrition and muscle wasting. Eventually, they become completely addicted, their bodies emaciated, and the function of their reproductive organs also shows signs of weakening. Men suffer from impotence, and women suffer from irregular menstruation, lack of libido, and difficulty in conceiving (those who are promiscuous use the power of drugs to strengthen their yang, which is only the excitatory effect of the initial drug use, but eventually it will be ineffective). The nervous system and mental aspects are even more severely damaged, reducing the ability of mental activity, and over time, various personality changes occur, that is, emotional life becomes narrower, interests decrease, and moral concepts are gradually lost. They are hypocritical, deceitful, untrustworthy, and ignorant of righteousness, even sacrificing their status and reputation without hesitation. This kind of abnormal personality is completely caused by poisoning, cannot be suppressed, and is not even consciously recognized. Some even experience mental excitement, delusions, or toxic psychosis. As for those who become addicted to smoking due to illness, although the disease is temporarily masked by the anesthetic effect, the disease is not cured, so the disease often gradually increases in secret. Once it occurs, the anesthetic effect of the drug has lost its efficacy. To seek medical treatment again is too late. This is also the harm of using addictive drugs. Therefore, I consider the reason for using addictive drugs to stimulate, refresh, or treat illness and maintain life, resulting in daily physical loss, to be the same as living on debt and pawn for a living. Because over time, they will inevitably become more and more impoverished. The energy obtained from drugs is not the natural energy generated by diet and nutrition in physiology.
