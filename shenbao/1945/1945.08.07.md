### The North Pacific Enters the Operational Season: Japanese Garrison Stands Ready, U.S. Recognizes Increased Importance of Northern Japan

Northern Base, 6th (Central News Agency Telegram) – The North Pacific war front is only suitable for operations during the summer season each year. The enemy's movements on the northern front can be understood by compiling recent enemy intelligence. The enemy has deployed relatively inferior forces on this front, with only the Ninth Fleet, consisting of a few light cruisers and destroyers, as the center, and an air force mainly composed of inferior medium and small aircraft and fighters stationed at land bases. Only a part of the Pacific submarine fleet is acting up from the Midway area. This is due to the constraints of climate and other natural phenomena, and does not mean that the enemy despises the northern front. On July 10th, when the enemy mobile force attacked the Japanese mainland, it subjected Muroran to naval gun bombardment, and then dispatched a small number of mobile forces to operate in the Fukushima area. At the same time, B29 aircraft frequently conducted reconnaissance. On July 28th, incendiary bombs were dropped on Aomori City. From this, considering the possibility of B29s carrying out strategic bombing of Hokkaido and the possibility of air attacks on the Karafuto and Kuril Islands from Iwo Jima and Okinawa bases, the enemy continues to act up, centered on the Aleutian bases, which they boast as the "Northern Pearl Harbor." U.S. military reporter Baldwin commented on recent Pacific strategy, saying that in parallel with the southern operations, the offensive operation towards the Kuril Islands of Japan makes the northern front extremely important. The reasons can be listed as follows: This area has now entered the operational season. The importance of northern Japan has increased. However, the Japanese side has built a strong defensive line with elite northern army and naval forces to wait for a good opportunity to annihilate the enemy in the face of the enemy's northern offensive operations.

### U.S. First-Line Commander Proposes Establishing Supreme Headquarters: Pacific War Situation Gradually Reaches High Tide

Lisbon, 6th (Central News Agency Telegram) – In recent days, there have been three important announcements regarding the Pacific War from the enemy side: 1. A joint declaration by the United Kingdom and the United States; 2. McWorcester takes control of the Ryukyu base; 3. Doolittle's proposal to establish a unified supreme command. The fundamental issue of the enemy's general attack on Japan has now been decided, as can be seen in the joint statement. The expansion of McWorcester's command authority is the initial work of the so-called "changes in region and command" in the joint statement. If the expansion of McWorcester's command authority is part of the Potsdam strategic approach, then changes will also occur in the war zone where the British General Mountbatten, who commands the Southeast Asian forces, is stationed. According to a United Press International dispatch from Washington, it is expected that the British military, in preparation for retaking Singapore and the Strait of Malacca, the only shortcut to attacking the Pacific waters, will likely place the East Indies under its own command. However, unlike the situation in Europe, no decision has yet been made on the most important issue of command authority, the establishment of a supreme command. This was not mentioned in the joint declaration on Japan. Doolittle said in a speech on Aviation Corps Memorial Day that the responsible first-line commander has put forward the idea of establishing a supreme command. He also said that Commander McWorcester has allowed the public release of the above information, which has attracted much attention. However, the U.S. Army Department in Washington declared that the above idea is not the official opinion of the Army. Well-informed sources pointed out that Doolittle is dissatisfied with the current lack of a supreme command, which has led to various difficulties, or that the higher-level authorities are issuing orders and instructions for trivial matters. Therefore, he has made the above suggestion. However, some also believe that Doolittle is quite dissatisfied with the triangular relationship between the strategic air force and the tactical air force (Kenny's Far East Air Force) and McWorcester. When we think of the fact that Doolittle's Eighth Air Force has already moved into the Okinawa base, which was originally stationed by Kenny's Air Force, we should know that the above news is not groundless.

### Ito Seiichi posthumously promoted to Admiral, announced by Japanese Navy Ministry

Tokyo, 6th (Central News Agency Telegram) – According to a statement from the Japanese Navy Ministry, during the Kamikaze operation launched in April of Showa 20 (1945) around Okinawa, Navy Vice Admiral Ito, commander of the Special Naval Attack Unit who had demonstrated the essence of the Japanese naval forces, and other officers and soldiers, sacrificed themselves for the great cause of protecting the imperial land. Therefore, the Commander-in-Chief of the Japanese Combined Fleet praised their special actions and announced their deeds to the entire army. According to the Navy Ministry's announcement on the same day, Navy Vice Admiral Ito Seiichi was posthumously promoted to Navy Admiral. Admiral Ito was from Fukuoka Prefecture. He graduated from the naval academy and served as captain of the Atago and Kirishima battleships. In Showa 12 (1937), he was appointed Rear Admiral. In Showa 13 (1938), he was appointed Director of the Personnel Bureau. He was transferred to an important naval position. In Showa 16 (1941), he was appointed Deputy Chief of the Naval General Staff. In October, he was promoted to Vice Admiral. In Showa 19 (1944), he was transferred from an important naval position to be Commander of the Special Naval Attack Unit.

### A Re-examination of the Kuomintang (1)

— Chen Gongbo

The Kuomintang and Constitutionalism

In the spring of the 17th year of the Republic [1928], before the publication of the "Revolutionary Review", I drafted an article that was first published in the "Contribution" magazine edited by Mr. Chen Xiaguo, and later became a small booklet entitled "The Crisis of the National Revolution and Our Mistakes." At the time, it stirred the hearts of every domestic and foreign youth. The publication of that article led to the later publication of the "Revolutionary Review". That article was considered a general review of the National Revolution after the completion of the first Northern Expedition, and it was also the first review of the Kuomintang, mainly focusing on the weakness of the revolutionary forces and criticizing the Kuomintang's compromise to the environment, especially to imperialism.

Since then, I, your humble party member, have not written any criticisms. In the 18th year of the Republic [1929] there was the Guangzhou Uprising, and in the 19th year [1930] there was the Expanded Conference Uprising. At that time, I was busy with military affairs and had no time to discuss theory. By the time the Expanded Conference failed, I thought my cultivation was not enough, so I quietly left the country in January of the 20th year [1931] to seek self-reflection. That year, I did not participate in the Guangzhou Extraordinary Conference. On my return trip in September, when the ship passed Copenhagen, I heard about the September 18th Incident [Mukden Incident]. At that time, I was on a ship in the Indian Ocean, and I could not help but feel a myriad of emotions. That night, I wrote a poem: "On the sea, sorrowful and clear, a hundred feelings arise, Year after year of turmoil, the fighting has not ceased, I alone leave my heart and soul to the bright moon, Only in old age do I realize that I am tired of party strife." I decided not to talk about party strife anymore, and hoped to do my best to help the country. Moreover, at that time, I still wanted to rush back to Guangdong and persuade the comrades of the Extraordinary Conference to cease the conflict and seek national unity. Unexpectedly, as soon as I arrived in Hong Kong, I learned that Comrade Chen Mingshu was already running around mediating, and that the Ning and Guangdong factions could cooperate. I was truly overjoyed. Later, I joined the Nanjing government and was determined to focus on revitalizing industry. I swore not to talk about party affairs. The reorganization of the Comrades Association had already been dissolved in January of the 20th year [1931]. Even for the small factions within the party later, I only painstakingly persuaded them to eliminate their prejudices and extinguish their private interests. Later, I resigned in December of the 24th year of the Republic [1935] and still resided in Nanjing, quietly observing the situation. The first reason why I did not talk about party affairs was that I really did not want to provoke any more pointless disputes. The second reason was that the true spirit of the Kuomintang had already declined, and talking about it would not help. If I did not talk about it, perhaps I could reduce some misunderstandings and allow people to bury themselves in the work of saving the country. In this way, although it was not beneficial to the party, it might be beneficial to the country. That was my thinking at the time. At that time, many friends were criticizing me behind my back, saying that I had truly returned to England, but I still smiled and ignored them.

Now, the call for implementing constitutionalism and establishing public opinion institutions is still heard throughout the country. Except for the Communist Party in Yan'an, which wants to convene a People's Liberation Representative Congress with the aim of confronting Chongqing and attempting to split the country, Chongqing has a resolution to convene the National Assembly in November of this year. And under the rule of Nanjing, Peiping advocated unifying and saving the country as early as last year. In the spring of this year, the People's Representative Conference even held a general meeting in Nanjing, demanding unification and demanding the establishment of public opinion institutions. It can be seen that implementing constitutionalism and establishing public opinion institutions has become a widespread demand throughout the country.

Why do the people want to implement constitutionalism? Naturally, it is an expression of opposing one-party dictatorship and demanding the return of power to the people. On this point, I truly sympathize and am willing to do my best to promote it. The Republic of China has been established for 34 years, and there has never been a constitution that is adhered to by both the upper and lower levels. This is a joke and a disgrace. According to the three stages of military rule, tutelage, and constitutionalism followed by the Kuomintang, constitutionalism should have already been realized. Because I not only sympathize with the implementation of constitutionalism and the establishment of public opinion institutions, but I also more willingly promote the time for implementation and establishment.

The creation of the Republic of China was truly rooted in the Tongmenghui [Revolutionary Alliance], the predecessor of the Kuomintang. China was able to achieve a nominal and somewhat forced unification, truly due to the National Revolutionary Army under the Kuomintang government. However, even if the Kuomintang has contributed to the country, it cannot be said that the Kuomintang must rule the world forever. Moreover, the main reason for the establishment of the Republic of China and the completion of unification lies in the support and efforts of the entire population in order to achieve results. Therefore, one-party dictatorship is only temporary, while returning power to the people is a matter of course.

However, I still want to defend the Kuomintang. What is one-party dictatorship? Why do we oppose one-party dictatorship? I cannot come up with a precise answer. The demand for constitutionalism did not start today. In the 17th year of the Republic [1928], there was already a call to shorten the period of tutelage. At that time, I had an explanation for tutelage, which was that so-called tutelage should use the party's policies to guide the government, and not just use party members to control power. What I knew at the time was that no one said that the Kuomintang's political program was wrong, even if it was wrong. Even if it was wrong, the National Government at the time did not actually implement the party's policies. There is no need to say anything else, even the most moderate land law was not implemented in the Nanjing government from the 18th to the 20th year of the Republic [1929-1931]. In the Nanjing government after I joined in the 21st to 24th year of the Republic [1932-1935], it was not implemented either. So how does the opposition to tutelage actually start? To say that it is wrong to have party members in power alone, I analyzed that since the Nanjing government, there has never been an executive yuan, the highest administrative institution, where all the ministers were Kuomintang members. There were also some who were assigned representatives to participate because of military cooperation, and there were also some who only became Kuomintang members after becoming ministers. These cabinet members' words and actions were not bound by the party. Their opinions and advances and retreats were controlled by the forces behind them. I often think that the Kuomintang, which claims to be a one-party dictatorship, is not even as good as an ordinary party cabinet. What else is there to talk about? To use this to say that tutelage is inappropriate, and to oppose tutelage, I feel that it is too abrupt, ridiculous, and unreasonable.

But who told the Kuomintang that they did not have the courage to come up with a political program to guide the government? Who told the Kuomintang that they had no way to select party members to take power? So after a period of time, I also advocated abolishing tutelage and urgently implementing constitutionalism. As for today, we don't need to go back and re-examine the archives and argue about right and wrong. Implementing constitutionalism and establishing public opinion institutions is beyond question.

What will the Kuomintang be like after the implementation of constitutionalism? Some party members believe that the Kuomintang should maintain its special status, while others advocate that it should be the same as an ordinary political party. But as for me, I am not concerned about the Kuomintang's status issue, but I am solely concerned about the party's own problems. If the party itself is not sound, will the people of the whole country acknowledge that you are in a superior position and can shoulder the great responsibility of the country? This article is aimed at this problem and re-examines it. At the same time, I further declare that if constitutionalism is truly to be implemented, I am willing to advise all political parties, except for those who want to overthrow the Republic of China, to conduct self-examination. Regardless of whether they are parties and factions under the rule of Nanjing, I frankly say that there is a need for them to examine themselves in detail and with an open mind, because the interests of a political party are not its own interests, but the interests of the country. If an unsound party wants to shoulder national affairs, it will harm the people in a small way and harm the country in a big way. We should put aside politeness and be deeply vigilant.

Commentary

### On the Issue of Evacuation of Primary and Secondary Schools

— Chen Binhe

On the first of this month, the Municipal Advisory Committee held a plenary meeting, and a proposal was made regarding the evacuation of primary and secondary schools. After its announcement, I heard that there are some misunderstandings circulating outside. I am making a special explanation as follows: School evacuation during wartime is a necessary measure for every country. Shanghai is a wartime city, so it cannot be an exception. Moreover, since July 17th, the city has suffered repeated air raids, and the trend is likely to intensify. In order to reduce damage, school evacuation should be prepared as early as possible. Therefore, the Advisory Committee had this proposal for discussion. In fact, this kind of suggestion is inevitable, and there is no need to explain the reasons. Moreover, logically, it should have been prepared and implemented long ago, without waiting for air raids to occur before talking about evacuation.

Currently, apart from schools, other organizations such as charitable groups are delaying evacuation on the pretext of poor security in the interior. In fact, although the security in remote rural areas may be slightly worse, the security in towns far from transportation lines is not as bad as generally imagined. Therefore, if schools can evacuate to towns with better security, away from the dangers of urban air raids, students' parents will certainly be happy to send their children to school there. We believe that the problem is not in the security aspect, but in the self-comforting psychology of the heads of the organizations, and the lack of a spirit of creating a new environment.

After the schools are evacuated, the livelihood of teachers and staff will not be difficult, because school funding will be maintained as usual, and the relocation expenses will naturally be subsidized by the municipal government. Therefore, school evacuation does not result in any losses for the schools, and has no impact on the livelihood of teachers and staff. In short, the livelihood of teachers and staff must be guaranteed.

On July 28th, when the Civic Welfare Association and the relevant municipal authorities held a meeting to discuss air raid relief work, Secretary-General Luo said that in order to establish hospitals for the wounded in air raids, there are currently no suitable houses, and small schools in central locations should be temporarily closed down, and the school buildings should be vacated for use as hospitals. Many attendees at the time agreed. This kind of stopgap measure to adapt to the needs of the environment is certainly acceptable, but rather than vacating the buildings and suspending classes, it is better to evacuate and relocate, and start school in another place, which is a fundamental measure. Taking a step back, it is still possible to gather students living near each other in several suitable student residences, and ask the original teachers to provide supplementary classes, so that although the school is suspended, the studies will not be interrupted.

When the Advisory Committee discussed this case, the attendees unanimously agreed in principle, but on the implementation, some argued that there was no immediate need for evacuation. As a result of the discussion, it was submitted to the Municipal Education Bureau for research and handling. Therefore, there are criticisms from outside that the municipal authorities and the Advisory Committee do not value education. However, we believe that this criticism is counterproductive. Our suggestion to evacuate primary and secondary schools is precisely to protect education and value education, and is by no means to destroy education. Some people also say, why only propose the evacuation of primary and secondary schools, and not discuss the evacuation of universities? Because universities are not within the scope of municipal government management. However, we have been advocating for the necessity of evacuating universities and vocational schools for several months. Not long ago (July 25th), this newspaper's editorial "Schools Should Prepare for Evacuation" specifically pointed out that universities and vocational schools should be evacuated first.

The results of the Japanese army's battles on the 31st and the 1st are as follows: five barracks destroyed, one material storage depot destroyed, one truck destroyed, and over one hundred enemy soldiers killed or wounded.

### Inside Story of the Chongqing-Yan'an Conflict: Both Sides Devoted to a Propaganda Offensive

Central News Agency Report: Although Zhu De, Commander-in-Chief of the Eighteenth Group Army in Yan'an, and He Long, Commander of the Joint Defense Army of the Five Provinces of Shaanxi, Gansu, Ningxia, Jin, and Sui, have repeatedly issued circular telegrams requesting a ceasefire, Chongqing continues to increase its troop strength in the areas of Yaoxian, Chunhua, Tongguan, and Baishui, deploying a strategic posture to attack Yan'an from the southeast, west, and three directions. The Chongqing military's actions are clearly due to the increasingly intense attacks from Yan'an, and is a very forceful means adopted by the Chongqing government to suppress them. Regarding the current military conflict between Chongqing and Yan'an, according to observations from well-informed sources in Chongqing, although Chongqing's attitude is particularly tough, Chongqing is aware that the current domestic war situation is extremely unfavorable both internally and externally. Their actions do not appear to be going beyond intimidation. Yan'an is taking advantage of Chongqing to launch a propaganda offensive to seize the opportunity to develop international relations. The attitude of the Chongqing regime towards Yan'an is as follows: At this final stage of the war of resistance, they do not want to cause internal strife. Yan'an's military strength is extremely weak, and they can be annihilated in one fell swoop if necessary. Considering the current international situation, inciting civil war is extremely unfavorable. Chongqing government spokesman Zhang Pingqun also stated that political means will be used to resolve the issue. However, the Chongqing regime has been clamoring for continuing the War of Resistance against Japan for nine years. Amidst the exhaustion of the people and the decline of all industries, they vainly attempt to obtain victory through further efforts. No matter what active measures Yan'an takes, if it evolves into a civil war, the people will be plunged into deeper suffering. What's more, it may cause widespread public resentment, and the years of resistance war will be in vain. It would inevitably tarnish the Chongqing regime's reputation as a major world power by leaving the stain of "domestic disunity," sweeping away its international dignity. Therefore, they hope to resolve the Yan'an problem completely through political means and, once the War of Resistance is over, they want to eliminate Yan'an's forces in one fell swoop. Therefore, after the military conflict occurred, the Chongqing spokesman was instructed to repeatedly declare the government's intention to resolve the issue, implying action against Yan'an. Also, Zhu De and He Long were ordered to issue circular telegrams one after another, demanding that Chongqing cease fire immediately. Zhu De's telegram, regarding Chongqing's active military offensive, used a passive tone to appeal to the national populace and the international community, seeking sympathy and attempting to shift the responsibility for the conflict onto Chongqing, which is the telegram's main characteristic. One week after the telegram was sent, on July 7, He Long sent a telegram stating that if the Chongqing army further increased its military force, it would resolutely resist by assembling the military forces of the five provinces of Shaanxi, Gansu, Qinghai, and Sui. Furthermore, Yan'an is well aware that Chongqing is currently unwilling to escalate to a full-scale civil war. Therefore, in the political arena, they continue to adhere to the establishment of a coalition government and continue to prepare to convene a people's representative assembly in the liberated areas. From the outside, both Chongqing and Yan'an are currently engaged in vigorous propaganda and are employing their respective diplomatic means. If the Chongqing government continues this state of military conflict, the upcoming Moscow talks will likely be severely affected, placing Chongqing in a difficult position.

### The Next Three-Headed Conference Will Be Held in Washington; Stalin Returns to Moscow

Tokyo, 5th (Central News Agency Electric Report) - London Reuters quoted a New York dispatch: US President Truman, on his way back to the country, stated on the cruiser "Augusta" that "he had suggested at the Potsdam Conference that the next three-power conference should be held in Washington. Regarding this suggestion, Marshal Stalin indicated that he would temporarily leave the Soviet Union to attend the conference if possible, and Prime Minister Attlee did not express any opposition."

Stockholm, 6th (Central News Agency Electric Report) - According to a broadcast from Moscow Radio: Soviet Supreme Commander Stalin and Foreign Minister Molotov returned to Moscow on the 5th.

Soviet Diplomacy Achieves Victory

Stockholm, 6th (Central News Agency Electric Report) - It is conceivable that Truman and Churchill originally refused Chairman Stalin's request, forcing the Soviet Union to submit to the policies of the United States and Britain. However, according to the released communique, the United States and Britain were completely controlled by the Soviet Union, and all of the Soviet Union's demands were passed. Reuters London reported on the reactions of various countries as follows:

Truman was eager to board the cruiser "Augusta" and return home, but before deciding to return, he used a wired radio to report the details of the meeting to the national public. Judging from his intentions, he wanted to avoid the people from questioning his concessions to Stalin. Furthermore, Sweden and France emphasized that the communique did not mention Japan at all. French journalists commented that the decisions of the Potsdam Conference would lose their meaning if the Soviet Union's attitude toward East Asian issues was not specifically stated. Furthermore, summarizing the reactions of the press in various countries: the tone of the US press is extremely common-sensical, believing that the Potsdam Declaration is a further step than the Tehran and Yalta Declarations, setting a new precedent for international peace. The French press paid close attention to France being selected as a member of the United Nations Council of Foreign Ministers, but the "Jiqi News Agency" ironically asked, "Can Attlee be qualified to be the Churchill of peace?" Spanish Broadcasting gave a detailed account of the Potsdam Communique, but did not mention the exclusion of the Franco government from the United Nations. Portuguese newspapers had the same situation as Spain, and did not mention the Franco government's abandonment at all.

Criticism from US Congressmen

Lisbon, 6th (Central News Agency Electric Report) - The US Congressional diplomatic circles and the press have complex reactions to the Potsdam Declaration. Senator Connally of the Democratic Party expressed unconditional support for the declaration, but Senator Taft of the Republican Party firmly opposed the westward expansion of the Polish border, saying that this practice was the root of a new war. Therefore, there was unanimous and fierce condemnation of Truman's concession to the Soviet Union without Congressional approval. The diplomatic community believes that the Council of Foreign Ministers of the Five Great Powers is purely a dictatorship of the Great Powers' reconciliation conference, and is merely an institution that makes small countries follow suit in an exemplary manner. According to a dispatch from Chongqing's Central News Agency in Washington, the general opinion there is that the inclusion of Chongqing and France in the Council is a means to rationalize dictatorship. The press avoids mentioning that the declaration did not involve the issue of Japan, which is a sign of the failure of the Potsdam Conference. Chongqing's Central News Agency in New York reported that Truman felt particularly depressed due to the unexpected calmness in the country after returning home.

### United Nations Preparatory Committee to be Held in England on Thursday

Lisbon, 5th (Central News Agency Electric Report) - According to a Washington dispatch: The US State Department announced the following on the fourth regarding the first implementing committee of the preparatory committee for the new international organization: Two experts from the State Department are scheduled to go to London next week to attend the first implementing committee of the preparatory committee for the establishment of the United Nations Security Council. The committee is scheduled to be held on the ninth, and representatives from 14 countries are expected to attend the meeting.

### Territorial Disputes Between Turkey and Syria Are Expected to Be Resolved

Lisbon, 6th (Central News Agency Electric Report) - According to a Beirut dispatch, the territorial dispute between Turkey and Syria over the acquisition of the Alexandretta region is expected to be resolved during the visit of Turkish Foreign Minister Saka to Lebanon. Alexandretta was annexed by France to Syria and Turkey in 1939, and now that Turkey has recognized the independence of Syria and Lebanon, Alexandretta should be returned to Syria. Lebanon is preparing everything to welcome Saka's arrival, and all sectors deeply hope that after Saka and the Lebanese Foreign Minister exchange views, a resolution to the territorial dispute between Turkey and Syria will be achieved.

### Egypt Demands Revision of Anglo-Egyptian Treaty: Sudan Status and Troop Withdrawal Issues

Lisbon, 6th (Central News Agency Electric Report) - According to a Reuters dispatch from Cairo: Egyptian Prime Minister al-Basha will deliver a speech in the Senate tonight (6th), demanding that the British government revise the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty of 1936, in other words, demanding that the British withdraw their troops stationed in Egypt and reorganize the status of Sudan. Al-Basha's draft of the speech has been approved by the cabinet. Al-Basha successively submitted requests to the British Foreign Office in Cairo for the revision of the treaty from 1942 to 1944. Now, the National Party of Egypt is also forcing al-Basha to demand the revision of the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty, which will not expire until 1956, which is encouraged by his party's politics, and the entire Egyptian population is also eager for the treaty to be revised. Regarding the request for the withdrawal of British troops, al-Basha pointed out in his speech: "Egypt has worked tirelessly in the war, and its cooperation with the United Nations cannot be said to be unsatisfactory." However, British officials in Cairo have not given any decisive answers to the Egyptian authorities' requests due to the entanglement of various wartime issues. The long-term British expatriates in Egypt deeply believe that this war has made the connection between Britain and Egypt more important, so the Egyptian authorities' current request to revise the treaty is not unfavorable to Britain. Regarding the request that Britain reorganize the status of Sudan, the Egyptian authorities are based on the reason that Sudan was conquered by Egypt. "Sudan should belong to Egypt" has been the slogan of the Egyptians to this day, and on the other hand, there is a very real and profound emotion of the Egyptians, because they deeply fear that once the Nile water is divided to irrigate the Sudan region, the entire Egyptian people will be plunged into poverty and famine. As for the Sudanese natives, they are now divided into two major factions, one is the pro-Egyptian and Egyptian support faction, and the other is the pro-British Sudanese faction. To this day, in all international conferences, the Sudan issue is often considered an intractable issue.

The police are responsible for maintaining social order and protecting the interests of the people. In recent years, due to high prices and the shortage of provincial and county treasuries, police salaries have been unable to increase. Therefore, they have been forced to seek extra income, and illegal acts often occur. Protecting the people has instead harmed them. Since Governor Ding took office, he has vigorously rectified the police in Zhejiang Province, starting with the provincial capital. The methods of rectification are: first, to stabilize the police's lives. Since June, the provincial capital's expenses have been increased by three-quarters, and food rations have been implemented for each police officer. Since August, it has been raised again, with the principle of 30,000 yuan per month for each police officer. At the same time, strict discipline is enforced, and the inspection police at the railway station, city gate, and wharf are strictly managed. In the past two months, there have been many cases of police officers being found to have delayed and extorted, and being dismissed and arrested. Therefore, the trend of police extortion in the provincial capital has been greatly reduced. Regarding the safeguarding of order in the city and the elimination of local ruffians and hooligans, a special service team has been established by the provincial capital police bureau to be solely responsible for it. As for the rectification of police in various counties, in addition to ordering the counties to effectively stabilize the lives of the staff and establish a police headquarters, recently, in view of the excessive number of police officers, which is not suitable for actual needs, the police in various counties have been divided into two types: security police and administrative police. The former are incorporated into the police headquarters to implement centralized training, so as to develop local armed forces to maintain local security. The latter are under the jurisdiction of the county magistrates. Except for first- and second-class counties that still have police bureaus, all third-class counties have a department in the county government to handle police affairs, so as to innovate police administration. Secondly, such as adjusting police weapons, universally implementing supplementary education for police chiefs, etc., are currently being planned and implemented in order. In the future, Zhejiang's police administration will gradually become clearer due to gradual rectification.

Eliminating Toll Collection at Checkpoints

The deepest suffering of the people of Zhejiang Province is the extortion by military police and security teams along the way. It exists throughout the province, densely distributed, making every step difficult. Taking the Hangzhou-Fuyang Highway as an example, in the past, from Hangzhou through Lingqiaojia to Fuyang, a distance of only sixty li, there were as many as forty extortion checkpoints. From Wulin Gate to Sandun Town, there were also seventeen checkpoints. Even at the main intersections in Hangzhou, police officers openly extorting small banknotes has become commonplace. The extortion of other county security teams, police inspection stations, etc., is naturally more than double that of the provincial capital. Therefore, the suffering of the people of Zhejiang Province is like being in a deep fire pit. Ding was furious when he learned of this illegal accumulation of burdens in the province, and immediately ordered the abolition of the blockade management office and various inspection stations. On the one hand, he strictly prohibited the military police and security teams under his command from setting up checkpoints along the way to collect donations and illegal extortion. In the past two months, progress has been seen.

Improving Public Security

Zhejiang Province is close to the front line, and the public security situation has always been lacking. This spring, the New Fourth Bandit Army moved from southern Jiangsu to western Zhejiang, and the public security deteriorated even more. After Ding took office, he requested assistance from the Allied forces and assigned certain troops and certain security teams to jointly suppress the New Fourth Bandit Army. The first phase aimed to open the waterway highway from Hangzhou to Wuxing, which took only about half a month and was completely opened, which was at the end of June. The water and land transportation between Hangzhou and Wuxing has been interrupted for a long time, and the people of Zhejiang feel particularly painful. This time, the New Fourth Army was driven out of western Zhejiang, and the economic benefits to the people are not small. The second phase of public security work is being prepared, and it is planned to improve it in stages to make the public security in the province good.

Rectifying the Security Corps and Troops

The Zhejiang Security Corps was originally very strong in terms of strength, but the military discipline and style of work were questionable, so the local people felt quite distressed. There were also many cases where the donation cards mentioned in the previous section were set up by the security corps. Ding believes that in the past, the salaries of the security corps and police were meager, and the salaries issued by the superiors were not enough to maintain them. Setting up cards to collect donations or other undesirable situations were not enough to buy them. Pursuing responsibility means that the responsibility lies with the provincial government and the Jing Wang Gong Office. Ding was worried and anxious after taking office, thinking of how to rectify them. The prerequisite is whether the provincial government and the Pacification Commissioner's Office distribute provisions every month, and whether the treatment of soldiers and police can be appropriately improved. Ding has decided to rectify them in stages and regions with two months of planning and preparation. The first phase of the rectification plan designated Hangzhou City, Hangzhou County, Yuhang, and Fuchang as areas for mechanical rectification. The treatment of the central army, Zhejiang Security Corps, and police in this area will be improved, with a monthly salary of 30,000 yuan per person and three dou of rice per person. According to this implementation, the provincial treasury will have to increase the burden by about 100,000 yuan per month. Ding has made the greatest determination and responsibility and has decided to implement it from August 1. However, Ding believes that the military, security, and police have had poor behavior and discipline in the past, because the superiors did not bear the responsibility of Jing Ji and provisions. For the past, Ding not only exempted them from reprimand and pardoned them. From August, the Jing Ji and provisions of the military, security, and police in Hangzhou and other places have been fully borne by the province. In the future, absolutely no undesirable behavior, setting up cards to collect donations, and apportioning rice to the people will be allowed. Ding also stated to all parties that the above rectification measures could not be universally implemented throughout the province due to the limited capacity of the province. As long as the province's tax revenue increases, the province's treasury is abundant, and the province's capacity is advanced, the province will also improve the salary and provisions of the police, troops, and security corps in other places. It is currently planned to handle them separately in accordance with the purpose of proceeding in stages. (End)

### Japanese Secretary Katsuno Criticizes the Three-Nation Joint Declaration Against Japan, Further Encouraging Japan's Fighting Spirit and National Unity

The Shanghai Hongbao Department held its first press conference yesterday afternoon (6th) at 4 p.m., inviting reporters from various newspapers in the city. Secretary Katsuno, Counselor Kishi, Lieutenant Colonel Shimada of the Army, and others attended. Secretary Katsuno criticized the joint declaration against Japan by the United States, Britain, and Chongqing in the recent Potsdam Conference. The content of the conversation is recorded as follows:

Declaration Motivation

Regarding the declaration decided at the Potsdam Conference, there are two points: First, the joint declaration against Japan, hoping to make Japan surrender unconditionally. Second, dealing with the German problem. I will now speculate on the enemy's hopes and combat. Regarding the handling of the German problem, there have been various reactions recently. Before the three-headed meeting, the foreign ministers of the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union had repeatedly contacted each other. Later, the heads of the three countries continued to meet. This proves that the opinions of the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union cannot be consistent. The situation is complicated and confusing. Therefore, the Potsdam Conference focused on European issues. Although the European War is over, it has not yet fully entered a state of truce. After all, the current poverty situation in Europe is also very important. However, before the handling of the German problem was announced at this Potsdam Conference, the joint declaration against Japan was announced first, which shows how complex the relationship between the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union is. Since the Soviet Union and Japan have maintained neutrality until now, in order to take the lead, the United States prematurely announced the declaration to urge Japan to surrender. This is a drama directed by the United States alone, and there has been criticism in its domestic public opinion.

Self-pulling and Self-singing

What is the reason for the United States' decision-making? In addition to the Soviet Union's neutrality in the Pacific War, and because British Prime Minister - Churchill fell - before, the British people witnessed the end of the war and sang peace. The United States, however, was deeply mired in the quagmire and had to restrain Britain. On the British side, it is an undeniable fact that they assisted the United States in the Pacific war in the past, so they were allowed to do whatever they wanted by the United States. As for Chongqing, they did not sign this declaration themselves, but only relied on telegrams to promise. Therefore, Japan believes that the Pacific issue is entirely self-pulling and self-singing by the United States and is not worth paying attention to. Although Chongqing has relations with the United States, it only relies on Song Ziwen's activities to abandon suggestions and opinions on important issues such as the declaration against Japan and the handling of the Pacific, which shows that Chongqing itself has lost its actual power in its diplomatic policy. Now that we have seen the so-called declaration against Japan, the content of which is as harsh as the declaration against Germany, it fully exposes the ambition of the United States to control the world. Therefore, the Japanese government believes that these conditions are too far away from the current situation in the Pacific and are completely divorced from reality, so it decided to ignore them. At the same time, these unreasonable conditions further encouraged Japan's fighting spirit, and the entire country united to achieve the goal of combat. The purpose of the United States in issuing this declaration was to force Japan to stop the war. Now that it cannot be achieved, it has been affected as a result.

Several Thoughts

I - down: First, Britain's signing of the declaration against Japan, as well as the recent - cabinet reshuffle, was indeed due to superficial involvement, which was inevitable. However, the domestic fighting spirit is now low, and it will be difficult to fight in the future. The United States, because it is difficult to get off the tiger, not only cannot obtain Britain's cooperation, but its burden is obviously heavier, and its future can be said to be full of difficulties. Second, Chongqing's participation in the middle has directly promoted the prolongation of the Greater East Asia War. In the stage of Sino-Japanese peace, overall peace is difficult to achieve. When we review China's history of the past 100 years, there has not been a day that has not been spent eliminating the aggression of Britain and the United States, which is the same as the current significance of Japan's Greater East Asia War. However, now Chongqing has reversed its past goals and abolished historical ideals, which shows that Chongqing itself has completely lost its independent power in diplomacy. It is firmly believed that the Chinese people will surely rise up to correct the ideal of China's own revival and strive for diplomatic autonomy. Based on the above, the following three points can be summarized: It promoted Japan's fighting spirit, and the future combat will be even more tragic. The United States instigated Britain and Chongqing to issue a joint declaration, but the result will be difficult to achieve the intended ideal. Recently, the methods adopted by Chongqing in politics are nothing more than the National Political Council, the National Assembly, etc., to win public opinion. Now it is - controlled by the United States and has lost its diplomatic main force, which is difficult to meet the expectations of the general public. The current talks will inevitably encounter difficulties. Therefore, Chongqing's participation in signing the joint declaration has no benefit to East Asia.
