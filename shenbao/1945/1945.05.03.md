Nansei Islands Base, 2nd (Central News Agency Telegram) – From the afternoon of the 29th to the 30th, Japanese Kamikaze special attack and air force units repeatedly attacked enemy ships around Okinawa Island and enemy mobile units in the eastern waters of the Ryukyu Islands. The Japanese units attacking the mobile units in the eastern waters sank two aircraft carriers. On the night of the 29th, the Japanese air force attacking ships around the island sank a destroyer.

A Certain Base, 2nd (Central News Agency Telegram) – The decisive battle for the Ryukyu Islands has now entered the stage of destroying enemy air bases. This decisive battle is indeed advantageous to the Japanese side. Since the evening of the 27th, the Japanese side has launched an all-out air offensive, suppressing the enemy air force day and night. Control of the night skies has completely fallen into the hands of the Japanese army. The aircraft used by the Japanese side are elite aircraft, and their tactics employ the so-called "Takeda Shingen strategy" of feigned attacks and real attacks, with a two-pronged approach, exhausting all possible night attacks. All night long, they launched group attacks on enemy runways and guide paths, causing the enemy elite to suffer severe setbacks. At the northern airfield, thirteen hits were made, three on the runway, resulting in two fires and one explosion. At the central airfield, eleven hits were made, resulting in one fire. At Ie Island airfield, their runway was bombed. Other airfields, such as those on Kerama Retto and enemy ships in Kin Bay, were also attacked. Continuing on the 28th, they concentrated artillery fire on the central and northern airfields, launching a fierce attack. First, Lieutenant Ogawa Tsugio and Sergeant Major Nakamori Teruo appeared in the vanguard aircraft, observing eleven columns of flames rising at the northern airfield and five hits at the central airfield, using machine guns to strafe enemy blimp groups, causing fires. Furthermore, on the auspicious day of the Emperor's Birthday, the 29th, led by Captain Eguchi Susumu, they concentrated artillery fire on the northern airfield. Among them, First Class Airman Honda Harukichi launched a single-plane attack on Kerama Retto, firing machine guns on the seaplane base, with bullets raining down in a desolate scene.

On April 6th, they attacked an enemy force consisting of twenty landing craft and seventy transport ships landing in the Ryukyu area. Navigating a long distance at sea, they captured enemy battleships in the sea south of Cape Zanpa at dusk that day. Braving fierce anti-aircraft fire, they bravely charged and attacked with their bodies, sinking five transport ships and two ships of unknown type, and also damaging two cruisers, one destroyer, five transport ships, and four ships of unknown type, setting some on fire. Their achievements are remarkable. Also, the Shinsento Body-Slamming Team, consisting of Lieutenant of the Army Nishioka Kenji and forty-seven others, since the enemy invaded, landed on Shinsento Island and used heavy artillery to fire on Okinawa Island. The lieutenants were ordered to disrupt the enemy's actions. On April 8th, they boarded wooden boats and departed from a certain base, breaking through the enemy's cordon and successfully landing on the southeastern part of the island. Afterward, they went straight to the heavy artillery positions. Under the intense fire of enemy heavy artillery, the entire team charged into the enemy's positions and fought bravely. In the midst of this, the leader was first injured, and casualties followed one after another, but they did not give in, continuing to attack, and finally blew up three heavy guns and their ammunition, also killing and wounding many soldiers, rendering the island's heavy artillery group silent for the next two days. Their contribution was great.

Editorial

### The National Sacrifice of Führer Hitler and International Trends

Oslo Radio broadcast on the night of May 1 that German Führer Hitler had died a national sacrifice that day. This is a shocking news that has astonished the world. Although the war led by German Führer Hitler against Bolshevism and to defend Germany, and the struggle led by the Allies against British and American imperialism, had different goals and targets, they were completely consistent in building an ideal new world order. Therefore, we people of East Asia unanimously express our condolences for the national sacrifice of the German Führer.

However, we must not turn to pessimism or disappointment about the ideal cause because of mourning for the death of Führer Hitler. Throughout his life, he struggled tirelessly to love his country and improve the world. During the First World War, he joined the volunteer army due to his patriotic fervor and fought on the Western Front, being wounded twice. When Germany was unfortunately defeated, his grief was unbearable. At that time, there were external threats of division from imperialists and internal revolutionary riots from communists. At a time when the country was on the brink of ruin, he organized the National Socialist Party in 1919. After many difficulties, he used the party as a foundation, and in 1933, he took charge of state affairs, turning the country from danger to safety, from weak to strong, and finally obtaining the protection of the entire country. Based on the threat posed by British and American imperialism and the Bolshevik Party to Europe and the world, he resolutely wanted to take Germany as the center and launched a grand strategy to build a new world order, which attracted worldwide attention. His political views were not completed, and he died a national sacrifice, but his spirit of loyalty and patriotism will always be recorded in history.

Although the death of the German Führer will have some impact on the overall war situation in Europe, as long as we understand German history and the national character of the Germanic people, we can firmly believe that there will be no surrender by Germany, and there will be no kneeling Germanic people. No matter how difficult the environment may be, Führer Hitler's spirit of regarding death as home will inevitably be emulated by future German leaders and the Germanic people. Now, former Admiral Dönitz has succeeded the German Führer. In his message to the entire nation, he has firmly stated that "the struggle against Bolshevism will continue until the German military and civilians can obtain a status of not being slaves and not being destroyed." This is precisely the manifestation of the German spirit.

From the broadcast of the new German Führer, it is clear that no matter what degree the changes in the war situation may be in the future, the Germans will never surrender to the enemy and will use various effective methods to persist in resisting the enemy. However, from the standpoint of the East Asian countries opposing British and American imperialist aggression, no matter what changes there may be in the war situation in Europe, there can be no influence on the determination of the East Asian nations to seek survival. At the same time, due to the German people's determination not to surrender and the intensification of the contradictions between Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union, the enemy will not be able to transfer troops from Europe to East Asia. The enemy's original forces in East Asia have suffered serious blows in recent counterattacks. We must strengthen our beliefs, eliminate any pessimistic and wavering emotions, and strive for future victory.

Travel Correspondence

### From Shanghai to Beijing

— Shi Qiao

The special express train from Shanghai to Nanjing East departs at 8:30, but the ticket check-in area is already crowded with people at 7:00. On this day, most of the passengers are still single merchants, mostly getting off at Wuxi and Zhenjiang. After arriving in Nanjing, I stayed at the Xiaoyang Inn. The next day, I crossed the river to Pukou, intending to take the Jinpu train to continue north. When I arrived at Pukou Station, I was told that the Huai River Bridge was under repair. After waiting for four days in Nanjing, the north-south passenger trains resumed. The crowding of passengers was no different from the Jinghu Road. The journey was safe and uneventful, with only an air raid alarm encountered in Dezhou, and no traces of aircraft were seen. The entire journey from Pukou to Beiping took a total of forty hours, which, according to the railway staff, was considered very fast.

The long-lost old capital is still bustling and the scenery is the same. In terms of population density, it is even more crowded than before the incident. This is an abnormal phenomenon of wartime, because the interior is unsafe, and many wealthy families have moved to the cities to live. The prices of goods in North China are also the same as in Central China, that is, they are constantly rising periodically. However, the prices of goods in North China have always been lower than in Central China. Since the base is small, although it has risen, it is still lower than in Central China. People who have lived in Beijing for a long time often lament the high prices, but people who come from Shanghai always feel that things are cheap in Beijing. For example, white rice, the quality of Jingxi rice is not much different from the ordinary thin rice in the suburbs of Shanghai. Although Shanghai is close to the rice-producing area, the price of rice is around 100,000. Although there are not many rice fields near Beijing, the price of white rice per stone is only about 56,000 yuan in Central Reserve Certificates. Flour and miscellaneous grains are also lower than in Shanghai. General industrial products, except for cotton cloth, are higher than in Shanghai. Because North China produces cotton and Tianjin has textile factories, the price of cotton cloth is not higher than in Shanghai. Indigo cloth retails for about 140 yuan per foot, or about 840 yuan in Central Reserve Certificates. This kind of cotton cloth has more patterns and colors than Shanghai. According to industry insiders, in recent years, prices have risen sharply, people's purchasing power has weakened, and goods are not easy to sell, so cotton mills have had to compete on the variety of patterns and colors. Most of the pedestrians on the streets of Beijing are ragged, fully demonstrating the poverty of the people.

The cheapest thing to live in Beijing is fuel. The allocated price of white coal briquettes is only 1,200 yuan per ton, and tree firewood is only two or three yuan per catty. The next cheapest is food and vegetables. As for foreign goods such as soap, matches, toothpaste, and cosmetics, they are all more expensive than in Shanghai. According to travelers who often travel to and from Nanjing, everything is cheap in Beijing, only gold and rent are expensive. The price of gold rises and falls with the market price in Tianjin, and the market price in Tianjin rises and falls with Shanghai. Because gold is small in volume and easy to smuggle, the difference in gold prices between the two places is very small.

The local bureau here believes that the high price of gold is enough to stimulate prices, so it has cracked down on gold merchants who are privately raising gold prices. Because the crackdown is extremely strict, most merchants dare not openly trade. They either use secret codes or gestures, and no one dares to publicly quote the market price. Recently, I heard that the authorities plan to limit the price of gold in Beijing and Tianjin to a maximum of 70,000 yuan per ounce. Whether it will be effective remains to be seen. Because of the surge in the price of gold, general prices are also affected. Compared with the beginning of March, prices at the end of March were about 10% higher. The price problem in North China cannot be ignored.

### New Foreign Minister Li Shengwu Scheduled to Take Office on the 5th

### Japan Continues to Lodge Serious Protest with US Over the Awamaru Incident

Tokyo, 2nd (Central News Agency Telegram) – Regarding the sinking of the Japanese ship "Awamaru," which was transporting relief supplies to prisoners and detainees of the United States and its allies, by a US submarine in the Taiwan Strait at midnight on April 1st, the Japanese government immediately requested a reply from the US government through the Swiss government, which shows that the US attitude is obviously insincere. On the 26th, the Japanese government again entrusted the Swiss Legation in Tokyo to lodge the most serious protest with the US government, and declared that it reserved all necessary rights to deal with such perfidious behavior. The protest letter detailed the circumstances of the "Awamaru" incident and concluded that the US's perfidious behavior was "an unprecedented outrage in the history of warfare." This kind of behavior is the US voluntarily abandoning the issue of the treatment of prisoners and detainees under the power of the Japanese Empire. The Japanese Imperial Government will thoroughly investigate the responsibility borne by the US government for this perfidious behavior that violates humanitarianism and the fundamental principles of international law. At the same time, the sinking of the Awamaru caused a tragic loss of more than a thousand peaceful passengers and cargo with the ship. The ship was transporting relief supplies to enemy prisoners, and its passengers included Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs Consul Suzuki and Hanami, translator, Yamana Fu, Sugita, Ministry of Greater East Asia Councilor Funakoshi, former Vice Consul, Arai secretary, Iwai, etc. The above-mentioned individuals died at the same time as the Awamaru. Among the remaining passengers were Vice Minister Takeuchi of the Ministry of Greater East Asia, Director Yamada of the Foreign Ministry Investigation Bureau, Director of the Political Affairs Division of the Southern Affairs Bureau of the Ministry of Greater East Asia, Togo, Secretary Hoshina to the Minister of Greater East Asia, etc. These were all officials of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Greater East Asia who were doing their best to transport relief supplies and rescue enemy prisoners, as well as many peaceful passengers, who were suddenly sacrificed, which is truly regrettable. However, the US's outrage has made the Japanese people even more furious.

Molotov took a tough stance and engaged in heated debate with Stettinius and other representatives of the American countries. After Molotov stated Argentina's past policies and actions, he said that if Porja is not allowed to participate and Argentina is allowed to participate in the conference, the credibility of the San Francisco Conference will be swept away. In the past, the invitation of various countries to participate in the conference was agreed upon by the four countries of Britain, the United States, the Soviet Union, and China, so this principle must not be violated. However, as a result of the vote, with the exception of eleven abstentions, the motion to invite Argentina to participate in the conference was finally passed by a vote of thirty-one to four.

To accomplish this great task, we must continue to fight. Führer Hitler died heroically, and the German people mourn him with the deepest sorrow and respect. Hitler had long recognized the terrible danger of Bolshevism, and fought against it at the cost of his life, dedicating himself to Germany. His fight against the Bolshevik flood not only benefited Europe, but also the entire world. The Führer has appointed me as his successor. I have been entrusted with this task in a time of crisis, and I am deeply aware that my duty as leader of the German people is to save them. The British and Americans are hindering our goals, and the German people will resist them. The British and Americans are not fighting for the interests of their own people, but are sacrificing themselves for the expansion of Bolshevism. What the German people have achieved and endured is unprecedented in history. In the face of the great difficulties to come, I will do my best to serve the German people, but I need your help to achieve this goal. Everyone must fulfill their responsibilities. Loyalty to me means maintaining order everywhere, so that we can reduce suffering and avoid collapse. If we do our best, God will bless us."

The greatest hero in German history has left this world. The Führer has appointed me as the leader of the nation and the supreme commander of the German army, to continue the fight against Bolshevism, until the German people can achieve a status of not being slaves and not being destroyed. The war against Britain and America will continue until they cease to hinder the German people's fight against Bolshevism. You have accomplished great historical achievements, and the German people, who long to end the war, are now still required by the circumstances to make unconditional further efforts. I demand that you obey, and only by implementing my orders completely and without reservation can we avoid chaos and destruction. Those who abandon their duties are traitors and will enslave the German people. Your loyalty to the Führer should now continue to me. Soldiers, the lives of the German people are in danger. Please fulfill your responsibilities and do not slack off."

### Central Reserve Bank Continues to Supply Cash to Banks and Money Shops; Profiteering Through Discounting Should Be Strictly Prohibited

There is a shortage of cash in the city, and businesses, banks, and money shops seem to be experiencing difficulties in buying, selling, collecting, and paying. The main reasons are nothing more than three points: cash flowing to other areas, citizens hoarding for emergencies, and unscrupulous merchants taking advantage of the situation for profit. However, according to inquiries from the financial sector: the Shanghai Branch of the Central Reserve Bank has recently been providing the 60 note-issuing banks of the banking industry and the Joint Reserve Committee of the banking industry, and the Joint Reserve Treasury of the money shop industry, with the daily amount of cash that they are allowed to withdraw. Based on the bank's leading position in the banking industry, the amount has been fully prepared daily for withdrawal, without interruption or reduction. Moreover, in response to their necessary requests, the amount has been appropriately increased to meet the needs of the market. It is incomprehensible why there is still a sense of insufficiency. On the contrary, profiteering through discounting is becoming increasingly rampant, and the amount of cash on hand is very large. The source of this cash deserves serious attention. It is hoped that the relevant authorities will take strict measures to prohibit it, in order to stabilize the market and ensure the livelihood of the people.

### Shanghai-Suzhou Highway Office Expands Scope of Work, Renamed Highway Construction Engineering Office

The Municipal Government, recognizing that although land transportation is still passable, most highways have fallen into disrepair due to years of neglect and are unable to handle vehicular traffic, and that the city is actively dispersing the population, it is imperative to carry out highway construction. Therefore, the Shanghai-Suzhou Highway Engineering Office was established and officially started work the day before yesterday, deciding to first repair the Shanghai-Suzhou Highway. It is now learned that the office believes that the highways connecting Shanghai to various counties are not limited to the Shanghai-Suzhou road, but also the two highways between Songjiang and Shanghai, and Wuxi and Shanghai, need to be repaired. Therefore, it is planned to carry out the work simultaneously. In order to expand the scope of work of the office, it has specially requested the Municipal Government to rename the office as the Shanghai Special Municipality Highway Construction Engineering Office, in order to reflect the actual situation.

Director Xu of the Construction Bureau Inspects Various Places

Otherwise, they will be punished according to the regulations once the deadline has passed.

### Finance Bureau Revises Slaughter Tax Rate

The Municipal Finance Bureau believes that the original slaughter tax rate is no longer applicable given the current prices of pigs, sheep, and cattle. After consulting the city's situation, it has been re-adjusted and revised to (A) 500 yuan per head for slaughter cattle; (B) 100 yuan per head for pigs; (C) 50 yuan per head for sheep. With the approval of the Municipal Government, the revised tax rate will be implemented from May 1st of this year. However, it is reported that this revised tax rate only applies to the urban and suburban areas and the outer counties under its jurisdiction. The slaughter tax in the old first and eighth districts will still be collected at the old rate for the time being. The unified collection method will be announced and implemented after it is formulated and approved by the Municipal Government.

Achievements in Income Tax Collection in the City

Since the Shanghai District Collection Bureau of the Income Tax Department of the Ministry of Finance instructed its subordinates to promote the collection of various types of income tax this year, the tax revenue performance has been improving. Due to the implementation of household-by-household accounting and the collection of evaded taxes, malpractices have been eliminated, and businesses in various industries have actively and enthusiastically declared and paid taxes. The average monthly tax revenue in January, February, and March this year reached more than 40 million yuan. It is now learned that the tax revenue in April has been even more enthusiastic. The total revenue in the first and middle ten days reached less than 60 million yuan. Although the figures for the last ten days have not yet been compiled, the amount is also considerable. It is expected that the total tax revenue in April will reach more than 100 million yuan.

### City Police Bureau Detains Two Rumormongers, Investigating the Source of the Rumors

The authorities of the City Police Bureau, believing that the recent rumors in Shanghai are mostly spread by illegal speculators in the market, attempting to stimulate market prices, have repeatedly dispatched personnel to investigate and arrest Yang Changgeng (58 years old, from Menghe, Wujin, residing at No. 3 Dunhe Lane, Xiangyang Road) and Huang Chifu (78 years old, from Wuxi, residing at No. 367 Fuzhou Road) at Fuyuan Securities Firm, Room 553, Huashang Securities Exchange, Jiujiang Road. Yang and Huang usually engage in unauthorized short selling and buying on the market, similar to the nature of outside brokers. It was found that Yang was a clerk in a Nanshi money shop before the Incident. After the Incident, he lost his job and speculated in the municipal government bond market. Later, he stayed in the securities exchange every day, engaging in illegal profiteering. At 3 p.m. on April 16th, Yang was at Fuyuan Securities Firm, talking with Ding Nianming, the manager of the firm, and Chen Xiuji, Huang Chifu, and other speculators similar to Yang, about market changes, and mentioning the Pacific War and the European War, taking the opportunity to maliciously spread rumors, attempting to gain illegal profits. The police bureau secretly controlled the situation and arrested Yang and Huang for strict interrogation. According to their confessions, they spread rumors in the hope of illegally changing market prices. It is heard that the police bureau is currently strictly investigating the source of the rumors and the illegal reasons. According to the police authorities, if similar situations are found again in the future, and those who maliciously spread rumors will be subject to more severe punishments.

It is also learned that from the 1st of this month, the vaccination sites of the central team have been moved to: the entrance of the Daxin Company on Qiaxiang Road, the entrance of the Sincere Company on Zhejiang Road, the entrance of the Great World on Ningxia Road, the intersection of Xinzha Road and Carter Road, the Bund Wharf, the intersection of Beichenan Road and Baoshan Road, the intersection of Xinzha Road and Xizang Road, and other places. It is hoped that citizens will voluntarily go for vaccination to ensure safety.

### Provisional Measures for Judicial Police to Seize Stolen Goods

The City Police Bureau found that there were no fixed methods for judicial police to seize stolen goods from pawnshops and second-hand stores, and that only the investigating officers issued notes, which were not uniform. In addition, the Crime Prevention Section of the Third Division found that some criminals impersonated judicial police and defrauded property in the name of seizing stolen goods from pawnshops. In order to unify the methods of seizing stolen goods and in response to the request of the Pawnshop Trade Association, the Crime Prevention Section formulated the "Provisional Measures for Judicial Police to Seize Stolen Goods," which was approved by Zhou Zhou, the concurrently serving Director, and has been promulgated and implemented. The measures are as follows:

1. When the liaison offices of the Third Division of this Bureau and the Third Section of each branch need to seize stolen goods, they shall follow the provisions of these measures.
2. When seizing stolen goods, the investigating officer must carry a three-part seizure book. The first part shall be filled out and issued to the store from which the stolen goods are seized as a temporary receipt. The second part shall be attached to the file for verification. The third part shall be kept in the section or left in the branch for reference (this three-part book has been printed and distributed to each branch by the Crime Prevention Section).
3. The first part of the three-part seizure book shall be filled out by the investigating officer. The second and third parts must be stamped with the seals of the head of the section or the head and deputy head of the Third Section of the branch and the investigating officer to emphasize responsibility.
4. If the store from which the stolen goods are seized is found not to have intentionally received the stolen goods, it can apply to the section or the Third Section of the branch for the stolen goods to be returned to the victims and receive the price of the stolen goods. The original receipt shall be kept for reference.
5. These measures may be revised at any time if there are any omissions.
6. These measures shall take effect from the date of approval. It is learned that the sections and branches have complied with and implemented these measures. In the future, judicial police seizing stolen goods from pawnshops and second-hand stores must use the three-part book to issue temporary receipts. If there is no such receipt, it can be refused and reported to the relevant branch for investigation.

Police Bureau Reissues Union Member Badges

The badges issued by the City Police Bureau to its employees in the past have been lost due to prolonged use. In order to prevent circulation, a new type of badge has been received from the Municipal Government. It has a black background and gold trim, and the words "市警" (City Police) are embedded in the center. It will be distributed to all employees for wearing from May 1st, and all old badges will be withdrawn and invalidated.

### Zhujiajiao Today

— Zhi Cheng

Zhujiajiao was originally called Zhujie Pavilion. The villagers commonly call it "Jiaoli." It is located twelve li from Qingpu, on the bank of the Caogang River. Its area is not vast, and its population is over 38,000, distributed throughout the towns and villages. For decades, it has not suffered from the ravages of war. Moreover, after the Incident (likely referring to the Second Sino-Japanese War), the rural areas were harassed by various mixed troops, making the villagers uneasy in their shops, and they gradually concentrated in the town, making the population more dense. Amidst Shanghai's evacuation of its population, no small number of Shanghai residents have come to this area. The current situation of Zhujiajiao is reported below:

Bustling Streets

The entire town of Zhujiajiao is divided into three towns: North Town, Zhanghe Township, Anzhuang Township, Zhangding Township, Xuewen Township, Shenxiang Township, and Yu'ao Township. The situation in the three towns is better, followed by the six townships. Within the towns, North Street is the most lively, with pedestrians constantly passing by. The essence of commerce is concentrated here. Because it was not affected during the Incident, the prosperous scene, it is said, is even more flourishing than before the Incident. Therefore, there is a saying that "Three Jing is not as good as one Jiao." (Note: Three Jing refers to Fengjing, Sixun, and Zhujing. The above three places suffered from the war, houses were destroyed, and the market was desolate.) It's just that the road surface is narrow, and it is also humid and watery.

General Livelihood

The environment of Zhujiajiao is better than other suburbs of Qingpu. The main products are wheat, beans, vegetables, fish, shrimp, etc. This place is traditionally known as the "hometown of fish and shrimp." However, in reality, the price of fish and shrimp is not very cheap. The reason is that when fish and shrimp are on the market in Shanghai, all the produce is transported to Shanghai as much as possible to obtain high profits, and the local price also rises accordingly, and sales are also not weak. After the market in Shanghai closes, the local vendors, in view of the previous sales, do not lower prices, so they remain similar to Shanghai. Imported materials are mainly bamboo from the Hangzhou area, so there are more bamboo products in the town, such as carrying poles, bamboo poles, filtering baskets, dustpans, brooms, etc. Fuel is mostly straw, and tree firewood has already been used as the driving force for production, such as the power generation of the electric light factory (Zhujiajiao Power Plant supplies electricity for five hours a day, from 7:00 to 12:00, at 1,500 yuan per degree), and the production of factories and the fuel for automobiles, etc.

Zhujiajiao does not produce much grain. In addition to the farmers eating it themselves, it is all purchased by the authorities for military and civilian use. Occasionally, there are also those who come here to buy from other places, but the safety of transportation is a problem, because there are many different troops in the four suburbs.

Public Security and Economy

In terms of public security, the garrison, security team, and police station maintain order, so the area is still considered peaceful. This town belongs to the sixth district of Qingpu County, and there is a district office. Under the district chief, there are three town chiefs. On the public's side, there are even Baojia (household registration system) and self-defense groups, attached to the district office, with two instructors in charge of the above-mentioned affairs, so cases of theft are very rare.

Zhujiajiao is the transportation center of the nearby suburban areas, so commerce is quite developed. The reporter only stayed for one day, and after wandering around the prosperous area once, had already seen various brands. On the lively streets, there are many food stores and department stores, but no bookstores, which may be in line with local customs. In terms of finance, there are no banks in the town, but there are four money shops open, becoming the backbone of commerce, and exchanging remittances with various places.

Educational Undertakings

Zhujiajiao's education is far from the standard. At present, there is only one middle school, four public and private primary schools, and one people's education center in the town. There are more than 1,570 primary and middle school students in total. The general level is below standard, and there are also many children out of school. The situation is quite serious. There is no shortage of wealthy gentry and merchants in Changdi (the location). They are usually willing to spend huge sums of money to rebuild temples, but do not pay attention to the importance of education, and rarely donate money to support schools and enlighten the people.

Housing Situation

The town's population has always been dense. After Shanghai's evacuation of its population this time, people generally consider this place to be a safe area, so the population has increased again. There are very few empty houses here, so the residents of this town have been greatly affected, and housing disputes have emerged one after another. The reason is that the current rent of houses in the local area is at least two sheng of rice per room, and as high as one dou. Therefore, second landlords take the opportunity to reclaim their property for their own use after the lease expires, evicting old tenants, so the district office often mediates housing disputes. Recently, a certain orphanage in Shanghai, through the efforts of the district chief, has borrowed a temple site as the site of the orphanage. It is said that the district chief is very enthusiastic about public welfare.

Water and Land Transportation

From Shanghai to Zhujiajiao, you can go by land to Qingpu, and then by water to Zhujiajiao; or take an inland river steamer from Shanghai directly to Zhujiajiao. The latter is more convenient, and the travel cost is also cheaper, only 2,500 yuan.
