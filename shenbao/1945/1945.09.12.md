### Government Agencies and State-Owned Enterprises to Use Legal Tender Starting Today; Private Citizens Holding Counterfeit Currency May Temporarily Circulate It

Nanjing, Central News Agency, 10th—Regarding the handling of counterfeit currency, the General Headquarters of the Chinese Army has recently issued a proclamation stating: The handling of banknotes issued by the puppet regime should await orders from our Central Government. However, government agencies and state-owned enterprises, as well as all tax revenue and expenditures, should completely use legal tender after being taken over by personnel dispatched by our government. Counterfeit currency must not be used again. All banks in the Nanjing and Shanghai area should use only legal tender for all transactions from September 12, 1945. Those who previously used counterfeit currency for accounting, regardless of creditor or debtor status, should immediately clear these accounts themselves. As for the date when the circulation of counterfeit currency currently held by private citizens will be stopped, it will be announced and implemented separately. All should strictly comply, and violators will be severely punished. This is the proclamation.

According to a Da Guang News Agency reporter's inquiry to relevant sources, the Central Government is thoroughly studying the methods for handling counterfeit currency in the occupied areas. Before General Commander He accepted the surrender of the Japanese army in Nanjing, he summoned Chen Xing, Li Junyao, Ling _, and Yang Fangdong, who had just arrived in Nanjing as special commissioners for financial reorganization. It is widely believed that this is related to the handling of counterfeit currency.

Mayor Qian's Remarks

Central News Agency Report—Regarding the issue of counterfeit currency, General Commander He Yingqin issued Proclamation No. 4 of the Legal Department on the 9th of this month, stipulating that government agencies and state-owned enterprises, as well as all tax revenue, should immediately use legal tender after being taken over by personnel dispatched by the government. Counterfeit currency must not be used again. There are also explicit regulations for transactions between banks in Nanjing and Shanghai. This matter concerns the medium of exchange and has a significant impact on the lives of the people in this city. The reporter paid a special visit to Mayor Qian of this city for instructions, and he replied as follows: "This city will certainly follow General Commander He's proclamation in handling counterfeit currency. In the future, tax revenue and state-owned enterprises will also uniformly accept legal tender. Hereafter, banks must not open new accounts with counterfeit currency. Those who originally used counterfeit currency for accounting, regardless of creditor or debtor status, should also clear these accounts themselves. As for the counterfeit currency currently held by private citizens, it can temporarily circulate to maintain the market until the central government stipulates a ratio."

The property will be taken over and managed by the Propaganda Department in conjunction with the local government. However, if the assets originally belonged to private individuals who did not collaborate with the enemy or to non-enemy nationals but were occupied by the enemy or puppet regime, they may be returned after verification and approval by the central government. (2) Handling of Newspapers, News Agencies, Magazines, and Film Businesses that Collaborated with the Enemy: Those who, after the withdrawal of the National Army, used foreign merchant names to conceal their operations in various recovered areas, and those who continued to openly publish or produce films in the occupied areas after the outbreak of the Pacific War and are confirmed to have collaborated with the enemy, will be handled according to these measures. The Propaganda Department will notify the local government to seal up newspapers, news agencies, magazines, and film businesses that collaborated with the enemy, pending disposal. All printed materials, such as newspapers, news agencies, books, and magazines, of the enemy, puppet regime, and collaborators, whose content contains the poison of enemy propaganda and violates the interests of the War of Resistance, should be screened by the Propaganda Department and then destroyed by the local government. In order to facilitate the advancement of propaganda, the Propaganda Department, with the approval of the central government, may, in conjunction with the local government, unseal and utilize all printing machinery, buildings, working tools, and other properties of the enemy, puppet, or collaborator newspapers, news agencies, magazines, film production, and broadcasting businesses that have been confiscated and sealed up.

(B) Procedures for the Restoration of Newspapers and News Agencies: (1) Newspapers and news agencies originally operated by the Propaganda Department, the Political Department, and Party Headquarters at all levels in various recovered areas before the occupation should be restored to publication in their original locations as soon as possible to facilitate propaganda. (2) Commercial newspapers and news agencies in various locations before the occupation may resume publication in their original locations after being approved by the government according to the following order of priority: Newspapers and news agencies that were originally published in the area and continued to publish and devote themselves to the propaganda of the War of Resistance after the occupation of the area by the enemy. Newspapers that were originally published in the area but suffered losses due to the occupation of the area, making them unable to relocate and publish, but whose publishers and principals still maintained their loyalty or served in the interior for the work of the War of Resistance and have records to prove it, and whose original publishers apply for restoration. Newspapers and news agencies that have moved inland from the recovered areas due to the war and continue to publish should, in principle, return to their original locations to resume publication. They may not publish elsewhere without special permission from the government. When local governments or the political departments of the military at all levels request to operate newspapers and news agencies in the recovered areas, they must apply for registration according to law before they can be published. Separate restrictions will be determined for newly established newspapers and news agencies based on the actual situation. Newspapers and news agencies in the recovered areas must be re-registered uniformly from the date of official takeover by the government. Newspapers and news agencies that have been approved for publication by the government may not request changes to their registration within one year. The registration of magazines will be handled by the government at its discretion based on the situation in each location.

(C) Handling of News Censorship and Film Censorship: (1) Newspapers and news agency manuscripts published in the recovered areas should be censored by the local government before the area is completely pacified.

### My Situation as a Japanese Prisoner of War; Chairman Chiang is Extremely Concerned; The Ministry of Military Affairs Will Send Personnel to Japan for Rescue

Central News Agency, Chongqing, 11th: Regarding the situation of our country's prisoners of war in Japan, Chairman Chiang is extremely concerned. In addition to having General Wedemeyer telegraph General MacArthur to investigate the situation of our country's prisoners of war in Japan and provide various forms of relief, it is reported that the Ministry of Military Affairs will soon send personnel to Japan to take care of them and transport them back to the country.

Central News Agency Reporter, Song Dehe, Tokyo, 9th: As the Allied Special Rescue Team (including reporters and photographers) is using vivid means, transporting American and British prisoners of war back to their countries by sea and air, thousands of our country's prisoners of war (many of whom have been fighting for six or seven years) are still being held in several concentration camps around Tokyo, without anyone to rescue them. After the Japanese authorities dropped leaflets from Superfortress B-29s over Japan on August 15, announcing the Emperor's unconditional surrender, they completely abandoned the Chinese prisoners of war. General MacArthur ordered the Japanese authorities to provide Allied prisoners of war with food and clothing and to transport them to designated locations. However, our country's prisoners of war were not provided with food, at least not in the two major concentration camps, nor were there any plans to transport them to Yokohama (Yokohama is the port of departure for released Allied prisoners of war).

Difficulties Encountered by Our Country's Prisoners of War

With the help of overseas Chinese, Captain Li Shengbin traveled by night to Tokyo to report on the hardships suffered by ninety-three of our officers and soldiers and one hundred and forty-four hired laborers detained in the Kobe concentration camp. They were extremely anxious because no one cared about them in the camp. When Captain Li arrived here, he was disappointed by the lack of rescue preparations for the captured prisoners of war in the camp. Meanwhile, hundreds of prisoners of war in nearby concentration camps (many of whom were British) had been released by the Special Rescue Team three days earlier. Captain Li is tall, with a haggard face, and comes from Henan province. After arriving here, he was unable to meet with Chinese officials or representatives and later met with a reporter for consultation. He was captured in Luoyang in May, has served in the army for sixteen years, was wounded four times in 1937, and also participated in the Battle of Taierzhuang. In the Kobe prisoner of war concentration camp, he was unofficially elected as the leader of the prisoners of war. Over the past year, he has striven for the rights and safety of Chinese prisoners of war. The Japanese army threatened to kill him because of his stubborn attitude and straightforward actions, but he was not afraid at all. The rice eaten by our country's prisoners of war in the Kobe concentration camp and the British prisoners of war in nearby concentration camps was purchased from Japanese people in a warehouse in Kobe on the night of August 15, after Japan's surrender was confirmed. The British also gave them some food and clothing, and American planes also dropped supplies at nearby prisoner of war concentration camps. The Japanese authorities did not mark the locations of our country's prisoners of war's residences. It seems that the Japanese army did not comply with the provision in the surrender terms that the camp locations should be marked. As a result, our country's prisoners of war never received any supplies. The British prisoners of war have now been released, and the Japanese side is not providing food to our country's prisoners of war. Captain Li is very anxious about this. At the same time, some Japanese are trying to put our country's prisoners of war in a difficult and uneasy situation.

Illegal Actions by Japanese Military Police

On August 16, Japanese police arrested nine prisoners of war from five countries, accusing them of stealing food, but they were later released without any basis. Four days later, three hundred armed Japanese Marines surrounded our country's prisoner of war concentration camp, insisting that our country's prisoners of war had stolen sixteen bags of sugar. Fortunately, the incident did not escalate due to the mediation of British military officers from a nearby concentration camp. Captain Li continued, stating that two Japanese men, wielding swords, attacked two of our country's prisoners of war outside the wooden fence, but after our country's other prisoners of war surrounded and arrested them, they were taken away by the Japanese military police after a long argument. Similar incidents did not only occur in the Kobe prisoner of war concentration camp. Several of our country's prisoners of war from the Osaka concentration camp recently visited the Kobe concentration camp to investigate whether any preparations had been made for their release. According to them, similar incidents also occurred in the Osaka concentration camp. Our country's prisoners of war in the Osaka concentration camp have always been despised by the Japanese authorities, but they have now arrived in Kobe by train from Osaka. According to their report, forty Japanese Marines, carrying rifles and bayonets, surrounded the Osaka concentration camp, threatening our country's prisoners of war. Our country's prisoners of war, believing that the Japanese had been defeated and should not treat them in this way, threw whatever they had at hand at the Japanese soldiers, eventually disarming sixteen of them. The Japanese Marines then fled and later returned sixteen rifles. Our country's prisoners of war then returned the rifles in their entirety. The reporter deeply feels that these long-serving soldiers should be rescued.

Commander-in-Chief Tang asked Lieutenant General Matsui of the Japanese side yesterday: On September 9, at 9:00 AM, General Okamura signed the instrument of surrender in Nanjing to General He Yingqin, Commander-in-Chief of the Chinese Army, representing Chairman Chiang of the China Theater. Are you aware of this? Since the Japanese Emperor accepted the Potsdam Declaration and surrendered to the Allied countries, Commander-in-Chief He has sent many memoranda to General Okamura. Are you aware of whether you have been ordered to comply? The regulations regarding all disarmament and various handover measures are very detailed. You should strictly follow them in the future. I am ordered to take over the Nanjing-Shanghai area. Regarding the Nanjing takeover mission, I have already summoned Lieutenant General Toshikawa Jiro, Commander of the Sixth Army, in Nanjing and specified the details in person. The following are the procedures for the Shanghai area takeover: Regarding the military takeover of Shanghai, the 94th Army will be assigned to take charge, with Commander Mu Tingfang responsible. The troops have been arriving gradually and will begin the takeover gradually from the 12th. Before the troops take over, the Japanese army will continue to be responsible for guarding and maintaining public order. The 94th Army will be responsible for the handover of weapons and military supplies. All other takeover work will be the responsibility of the municipal government, and I will issue orders for its execution. Regarding the takeover work of other departments, a takeover committee will be organized, with the mayor as the chairman. The committee will submit plans for how to take over and the steps to be taken, and then orders will be issued. However, the business departments other than military affairs are more complex and cannot be completed in a short time. It is hoped that all public affairs will continue to be maintained without interruption before the takeover. Public enterprise property and special materials must not be moved before the takeover. Technical workers should continue to work as usual. After the takeover, they will be given a trial period based on the results of the assessment. Confidential matters. Residence issues will be resolved after consultation with the municipal government and will be notified later. Japanese officers and soldiers will be allowed to temporarily retain the Japanese military rations currently available for distribution and consumption.
