### Declaration

"The National Government, under the leadership of Wang Jingwei, returned to Nanjing in the 29th year of the Republic [1940], declaring to the nation the two major policies of realizing peace and implementing constitutional governance. Its main purpose was, in the aftermath of national devastation, to seek national independence and freedom through peace, and to seek national construction and revitalization through constitutional governance. Since returning to the capital, all administrative construction measures, before the full realization of peace, have striven to preserve the nation's vitality, pacify the displaced people, and work tirelessly for six years. However, due to circumstances, full peace could not be achieved, and the beneficial policies could not be implemented. Every time we reflect on this, we feel a greater sense of guilt. Now that the world has returned to peace, and China and Japan have eliminated the ravages of war, although the method of peace is different from what we have always strived for, national independence and freedom are in line with what the people of the whole country hope for. We believe that the country should now return to unification, and our mission has come to an end. We hereby announce the immediate dissolution of the Nanjing National Government, in order to fulfill our long-cherished wish for unification. The Central Government Committee has been reorganized into the Nanjing Provisional Political Affairs Committee, and all duties of the National Government will be immediately transferred to the Committee for separate handling, pending conclusion. The provincial and municipal governments should continue to maintain local order, so that affairs are not interrupted, and people can feel secure. After that, they should urgently plan for the transition and gradually abolish the existing system. As for the Military Affairs Commission, it will be reorganized into the Security Committee, and its transferred troops and local forces should maintain their defensive positions to protect the people and ensure their safety. In the face of the current situation, they should especially adhere to their original defenses. If there are bandits or planes causing disturbances or attempting to sabotage unification, they should still be suppressed to eliminate the source of unrest and await reorganization for national service. It must be understood that stabilizing the localities is the foundation for national unification, and unifying the country must primarily focus on stabilizing the localities first. Our country has long suffered from upheavals, and the people have suffered deeply. The source of unrest has yet to be eradicated, and hidden worries have not been alleviated. It is hoped that all military and political leaders and the people of all regions will understand the importance of national unification and refrain from any extraneous actions, and even more so, refrain from clinging to territories, so that China can be unified as soon as possible, and the nation can be revitalized as soon as possible. This will not betray the original aspiration of the National Government to persevere and bear the burden for the past six years, nor will it betray the National Government's and the people's arduous struggle. This declaration is hereby made to inform the public."

### Reorganization of Puppet Currency System; Plans Nearing Completion; Prices in Chongqing Fall

Central News Agency report from Chongqing: Since Japan accepted the Potsdam Declaration, the Chongqing financial market has experienced dramatic fluctuations. The price of gold has fallen to 118,000 yuan per tael, the price of US silver dollars has fallen to 18,000 yuan, and the prices of general merchandise have also plummeted by 40 to 50 percent. Dyes, fabrics, cigarettes, and miscellaneous goods have also suffered significant price drops. In contrast, export goods such as tung oil have seen prices rise due to expected overseas demand. The price of tung oil once rose to 6.8 million yuan (per 10,000 jin) and then fell to 6.2 million yuan. Among domestic products, tobacco leaves and sugar prices have also soared. According to relevant authorities, the fluctuations in the Chongqing financial market were expected, but they are only temporary. The responsible parties have already prepared plans to stabilize the national finances, reorganize the post-war currency system, and handle the puppet currency system in the occupied areas, which have been submitted to the authorities for review and implementation.

### Sino-Soviet Negotiations Concluded; Treaty of Friendship and Alliance Signed; Song Ziwen Leaves the Soviet Union for Washington

Central News Agency dispatch from Moscow, 15th: The Sino-Soviet negotiation teams have concluded, and after the new treaty was signed, the Soviet side issued the following communique today: After Chairman Stalin attended the Potsdam Conference, President of the Executive Yuan of China Song Ziwen, and Foreign Minister Wang Shijie also arrived in Moscow to continue negotiations with Chairman Stalin and Chairman Molotov of the People's Commissariat for Foreign Affairs. The two countries signed a Treaty of Friendship and Alliance on the 14th of this month. Complete consensus has also been reached on all other issues of mutual concern. The contents of the treaty and other agreements will be announced soon after they are ratified by the heads of state of China and the Soviet Union.

Central News Agency report from Stockholm, Sweden: President of the Executive Yuan of China Song Ziwen flew from Moscow to Washington yesterday. Chairman Molotov of the Soviet People's Commissariat for Foreign Affairs personally saw him off.

### Central Reserve Bank to Maintain Status Quo; Value of Reserve Notes to Increase; Minister Zhou Gave a Speech Yesterday

Central News Agency dispatch from Nanjing, 16th: Zhou Fohai, President of the Central Reserve Bank, gave the following speech regarding the Central Reserve Bank maintaining its current status and the value of Central Reserve Notes increasing: The situation has changed rapidly, and comprehensive peace has been achieved. Although there have been changes in the Nanjing Central Political Organization, the Central Reserve Bank, which is related to the people's lives and property, should maintain its current status. The value of the Central Reserve Notes it issues will not only not decrease, but will also increase. The funds borrowed from the Japanese side have already been repaid in gold, and the Central Reserve Bank has sufficient cash reserves. With the cessation of military operations, expenditures will be greatly reduced, and the amount of issuance will inevitably decrease accordingly. Furthermore, prices will gradually decline in the future, so the amount of over-issuance is unlikely to expand. The Central Reserve Notes are currently in the hands of the people and are the people's property. If their existence is denied, the loss will inevitably be borne by the people. In order to reduce the people's sacrifice, the authorities will not do this. I am currently in negotiations to ensure that the people's interests are protected. I sincerely hope that all sectors will not be misled by rumors and create unnecessary panic. This is of utmost importance.

### Departments Directly Under the Propaganda Ministry Ordered to Continue Work as Usual

Central News Agency dispatch from Nanjing, 16th: The Propaganda Ministry believes that with the realization of peace and the restoration of construction, regular work is urgently needed, and propaganda work is even more important. It is essential to quietly continue working and provide regular services. All materials and equipment are public property and should be carefully protected to avoid any loss. A special telegram has been sent to all departments directly under the ministry inside and outside the capital, the Central News Agency's branches, the China Broadcasting Corporation's headquarters and its affiliated radio stations, local newspapers, the China Film Company, and the Central Daily News distribution offices, etc., to comply. Any negligence that results in damage or loss will be the responsibility of the relevant responsible personnel.

### General Higashikuni of Japan Commences Organizing a New Cabinet; An Imperial Prince is Ordered to Form a Cabinet for the First Time

Central News Agency report: Domei News Agency, Tokyo, 16th: Prime Minister Suzuki convened an extraordinary cabinet meeting (the Army Minister was absent) at 2:00 PM on the 15th, explaining the changing international situation and deciding to resign. At 3:20 PM, the cabinet members submitted their resignations. Prime Minister Suzuki issued a statement after leaving the palace, stating that the country is now entering a new period of construction and should give way to younger and more capable individuals. He is old and weak and unable to bear the heavy responsibility, therefore, he tendered his resignation.

Central News Agency report: Domei News Agency, Tokyo, 16th: With the war now over and the urgent need to promote post-war reconstruction, the Emperor has ordered Imperial Prince General Higashikuni to organize a successor cabinet. This is the first time in Japanese history that an Imperial Prince has been ordered to form a cabinet.

Central News Agency report: Domei News Agency, Beijing, 16th: The Japanese Army in North China announced on the 15th that after receiving the Imperial Rescript, the highest commander of the Japanese Army in North China immediately instructed all soldiers along the front line, stating in brief: The Japanese Army in North China, in order to adapt to the changing situation, will strengthen its determination to die for the Empire and complete its combat mission. However, today, upon receiving the Imperial Rescript, we are deeply fearful of the Great Commander's concern for the battlefield and the country's future. Abandoning combat is the greatest shame for a military man. How can we face the spirits of our predecessors? All our soldiers should follow the Great Commander's intentions and refrain from rash actions. This is what I am telling all the soldiers.

### Announcement by the Defense Commander in Beiping

Central News Agency report: Domei News Agency, Beijing, 16th: The Japanese Defense Commander in Beiping issued an announcement on the 15th, informing the residents of Beiping to remain calm and act in an orderly manner, and especially to be cautious in their words and actions towards the Chinese.

Military officers and civilians have shared weal and woe for the sake of the nation's survival and the stability of East Asia. Now, in order to maintain the 3,000-year-old national polity, preserve the nation, and maintain human culture, we must cease hostilities. Today, we must endure the hardships ahead and further strengthen our friendship with China. I urge all residents to follow the instructions of the Imperial Rescript, refrain from rash actions, maintain the dignity of Japanese subjects, and respond calmly.

### Statement by Japanese Minister of Finance Hirose: No Freezing Policies Will Be Adopted; Market Situation in Beijing is Still Stable

Central News Agency report: Domei News Agency, Tokyo, 16th: On the 15th, there was a slight flow of funds in the financial market, but the general situation was no different from usual and remained stable.

In the afternoon, there was a small amount of fund flow, and the situation seemed more tense for a while. Later, Minister of Finance Hirose issued a statement clarifying the emergency measures, specifically pointing out that no freezing policies would be adopted. Market sentiment returned to calm. Some bank depositors in various financial institutions made withdrawals, but the process was smooth, and the depositors did not show any signs of anxiety.

### Petain Sentenced to Death; Execution May Be Avoided Due to Old Age

Central News Agency report: Stockholm, Sweden, citing Paris: Former head of the French Vichy government, Petain, was formally sentenced to death by the Supreme Court yesterday for crimes against the state. After a detailed discussion by the jury for six hours, the court hoped that the death sentence would not be carried out due to Petain's old age.

### Restoration of Peace for Japan Must Go Through Three Stages

Central News Agency report: Domei News Agency, Tokyo, 16th, pointed out that although the war has now ceased, reaching the stage of complete peace will require going through three stages. First, the Japanese government must order the army and navy to cease all acts of war on a specific date and time. All battle lines in China, Southeast Asia, and the Pacific must be fully complied with, and the four countries must be notified to cease fighting. Second, a ceasefire agreement must be signed. The United States has already appointed General MacArthur as its representative, and the other three countries are expected to appoint their representatives soon. In this way, the cessation of military action will have a legal basis. Third, a truce treaty must be signed, which, based on the Potsdam Declaration, will specifically determine the handover of warships and weapons, the handling of military positions, and the issue of occupation and reparations. Only after the truce treaty is established can the state of war be completely ended. However, the conclusion of a truce treaty cannot be accomplished in a short period of time. During this period, the sovereignty of an independent country will naturally not be restored, and the people must be prepared for hardship while waiting for the conclusion of a peace treaty. Only then can Japan restore its international status and send envoys abroad.

### British Prime Minister's Broadcast

Central News Agency report: Stockholm, Sweden: British Prime Minister Attlee broadcast at midnight on Tuesday, announcing that the United Nations had officially accepted the Japanese government's response to cease the war. At the same time, according to TASS, the Soviet government also announced its acceptance of the Japanese response to cease hostilities.

Editorial

### The Demeanor of a Great Nation

World peace is already facing us. The long-held aspirations of people around the world are about to be fully realized. No one can restrain the excitement in their hearts. However, as we said yesterday, while we are excited internally, we must remain calm externally. Only by restraining our emotions with reason can we take on the more arduous tasks of the future.

Why must we remain calm? It is to hope to achieve "tranquility to achieve far-reaching goals." Because although the war is over and peace has been achieved, what follows is how to maintain public security, maintain order, and ensure the smooth progress of peace work? In particular, how to intensify unity, leaving no village behind, so that the work of reconstruction and construction can be promoted in an orderly manner? These tasks are urgently needed and cannot be promoted by temporary excitement or accomplished by rash actions. Therefore, in order to jointly shoulder the successful completion of the work of peace and jointly undertake the heavy responsibility of reconstruction, everyone must work hard under the methods determined by the government and under the instructions of the government, in order to achieve the effect of division of labor and cooperation.

Most of the people have undergone long-term and arduous training to achieve today's peace, and the future reconstruction work is extensive and onerous. In the future, we need trained and experienced people and talents from various fields to participate in the work together. Therefore, we focus on the importance of completing future reconstruction work, and instead of passively settling scores, we should actively uphold justice, be magnanimous, set lofty goals, and call for hard work, so that those who are burdened with shame and humiliation can be inspired by justice, be grateful for the country's reports, and work hard together. We firmly believe that the conscience of patriotism will not be extinguished for long. All of them have the desire to rely on the current work of peace and the upcoming work of reconstruction.

I recently read the notice issued by the Political Commissioner's Office of this city, hoping that the citizens will follow the central government's intentions, maintain calmness, and earnestly maintain order. We should have the demeanor of a great nation with magnanimity and sympathy towards Japanese residents, and not treat them with disrespect. We cannot help but feel ashamed when we read the sentence "demeanor of a great nation." And we feel that this is the dawn of a clear future for Chinese politics, as we read this announcement for the first time in eight years. Because the "demeanor of a great nation" has been buried for a long time. In recent years, social phenomena in Shanghai have been full of speculation and deception, selfishness and self-interest. Once the situation changes, they immediately become emotionally agitated and express themselves in rash actions, which are far from the "demeanor of a great nation." Now, the authorities have specifically pointed out that "the demeanor of a great nation with magnanimity and sympathy should be adopted," and that Japanese residents should not be treated with disrespect, which shows that it is expected that every citizen of Shanghai can have a heart of "magnanimity and sympathy" and achieve the true demeanor of a great nation.

When the people have the demeanor of a great nation, the country has the demeanor of a great country. The demeanor of a great nation is based on magnanimity and sympathy, so the demeanor of a great country is undoubtedly also based on magnanimity and sympathy. The country requires the people to have the demeanor of a great nation based on magnanimity and sympathy, and at the same time, the people require the country to have the demeanor of a great country based on magnanimity and sympathy.

At this time of entering a new era and starting the work of rebuilding a new China, the country should have the demeanor of a great country, and the people should have the demeanor of a great nation, in order to rebuild the national morality that has fallen since the war. The only steps to practice the demeanor of a great country and a great nation are to be magnanimous and not to blame the past; to immediately abandon speculative behavior for personal gain; to look at everything from a long-term perspective and start from the near future; to obey orders and abide by order. At this critical turning point in the country's prosperity, everyone should seize the opportunity to get rid of the old and embrace the new, and strive to move forward!

Suburban Correspondence

### Current Situation in Pudong

— Li Wenzhong

Pudong originally had the hope of flourishing, with the construction of water and electricity plants, the renovation of ferries, and the operation of large buses on Pudong Avenue. After the war, its appearance was completely changed.

Disorderly City Appearance: The once prosperous area of Pudong, along Laini Ferry Street and Changfan'erlixu, was filled with shops. Now, only broken tiles remain, overgrown with weeds and thorns. As a result, shops and institutions have concentrated on Dongchang Road. Last November, it was suddenly bombed, causing about two hundred casualties. Because of this, residents of Dongchang Road and nearby areas returned to their hometowns, making the city appearance even more depressed.

At the end of Dongchang Road, it connects to Pudong Avenue. Pudong Avenue goes north through Yangjing Town to Gaoqiao (Qingning Temple), and south to Zhoupu Town. There are privately-operated long-distance buses, with a fare of 30,000 yuan per trip, for transporting goods and merchants. Zhoupu is also a distribution center for the rice market, with bustling shops, surpassing Dongchang Road. However, gambling is rampant. Qingning Temple is the center of the secular world, where impoverished people from the suburbs of Shanghai carry burdens on their shoulders, seeking a meager profit to make a living. They are subjected to heavy exploitation along the way. Although this trend has been somewhat curbed, it has not been completely eliminated.

Impoverished Farmers Abound: On both sides of Pudong Avenue, fields are crisscrossed by paths, all used for cultivation. In the past, much of it was wasteland, but now that agricultural products are surprisingly expensive, farmers are competing to cultivate the land, not leaving any idle. However, due to overpopulation, owning ten acres is considered a rare and valuable thing. As a result, most of the farming is done by weak women, while men mostly seek employment in industry and commerce. The fertilization of farmland lacks any direction, planting methods are stuck in the old ways, and good harvests are left to fate. Agricultural tools are incomplete, and by-products such as livestock are not well-managed. Few people are willing to try new things. In short, most are poor farmers, but vegetables can be transported and sold in Shanghai, so production is quite high.

Along the banks north of Dongdao Road, there were many factories before the war, but most are now closed. Among them, Yizhong Company still manufactures cigarettes.

Migrant Residents Along the River: Migrant residents gather along the river, especially those from Jiangsu and Anhui, who are known for their hard work and resilience. They live in thatched huts and endure all hardships. However, education is low and superstition is rampant. Next are migrants from Ningbo, Zhejiang, who are also numerous.

Low Level of Culture: The customs of Pudong have always been known for their frugality and hard work. Now, with prices soaring, women and children carry rice and sell salt, working even harder. However, superstition is rampant and knowledge is low. When marrying off their children, they must have a "fortune teller" calculate their horoscopes. When someone in the family is sick, they must first pray to the gods instead of seeking medical help. Children often cause parents much worry. Residents lack grand ideas and have been ridiculed for having limited ambition, with sayings like "Their ambitions don't exceed a rice basket, and they don't travel beyond a hundred li." Perhaps this is due to the geography! As for the bustling towns, they mostly imitate the extravagance of Shanghai, and customs are also different. Education in the southern district of Pudong: due to the lack of proper school buildings, everything is makeshift. There are about a dozen private and public primary schools, and three middle schools: Zhenxin, Wudong, and Junde. There is also a normal school, and many school sites are still under preparation. It is said that private schools will have difficulty maintaining themselves next semester, which is a major blow to the educational circles of Pudong. It is hoped that the Bureau of Education will provide assistance.

Superstition is Rampant: In terms of religion, most people believe in Buddhism. Zhangjialou is mostly Christian. In recent years, there is also "Yiguan Dao" (Unity Sect), which is rapidly gaining popularity (also known as Chonghua Hall), meaning that all religions are united, incorporating the teachings of Confucius and Mencius. They also set up altars, using gods and Buddhas as an excuse. Believers are divided into male "Qian Dao" and female "Kun Dao". Each church enshrines complex and confusing images of Guanyin, Jigong, and Maitreya, making it difficult to know which to follow. They call the leader "Dian Chanshi" (Enlightened Master). Each major town has churches, which also provide free medical services. However, because it does not shed its superstitious nature, it is ridiculed by those with biased views, who are mistaken for knowledgeable. However, they have no known rebellious actions. It is assumed that whenever the situation is unstable, and people suffer both mentally and physically, they hear of empty and illusory claims and believe that they can resolve all "demonic tribulations", and blindly follow them!

### Full Text of Diplomatic Documents Exchanged Between Japan and the Four Nations of China, the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union

The four nations replied on August 11th and sent it to the Japanese government through the Swiss government on the morning of August 12th. The reply was signed by US Secretary of State Byrnes on behalf of the four nations. The Japanese government sent this reply to the US government through the Swiss Minister on August 14th, and it arrived at the US government on the morning of August 15th. The original text is as follows:

Application by the Japanese Government to Accept the Potsdam Declaration: The government of the Japanese Empire, in order to promote world peace and eliminate the suffering caused to mankind by the continuation of the war, and wishing to end the fighting as soon as possible, at the behest of His Majesty the Emperor, requested the Soviet Union government, which maintained neutral relations at the time, to restore peace several weeks ago. Unfortunately, this effort did not succeed. Now, based on His Majesty the Emperor's desire to overcome the general hope for peace, and striving to end the war as quickly as possible, we have decided to accept the conditions of the joint declaration issued by the heads of government of China, the United States, and the United Kingdom in Potsdam on July 26, 1945 (later joined by the Soviet Union). However, please understand that this does not include the requirement to change the Emperor's authority to rule the nation. The Imperial Government firmly believes that the above understanding is correct and hopes for a prompt indication of a clear intention regarding this condition.

The United States government, representing the Republic of China, the United States of America, the United Kingdom, and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, has received the Japanese government's reply requesting acceptance of the conditions of the Potsdam Declaration, stating that the understanding does not include the requirement to change the Emperor's authority to rule the nation. Regarding the Japanese government's note, our position is as follows:

From the time of surrender, the Emperor and the Japanese government's authority over the nation should be placed under the limitations necessary for the Supreme Commander of the Allied Forces to implement the terms of surrender. The Emperor shall be given the authority to guarantee to the Japanese government, the Japanese Imperial General Headquarters, the necessary surrender conditions for signing and implementing the terms of the Potsdam Declaration. In addition, the Emperor shall issue orders required by the Supreme Commander to all officers and authorities of the Japanese land, sea, and air forces, and to all troops under the command of these officers, regardless of location, to cease hostilities, hand over weapons, and implement the terms of surrender. After the surrender, the Japanese government shall immediately transfer prisoners of war and detainees to safe locations for embarkation on Allied ships. Regarding the final form of the Japanese government, it shall be decided by the Japanese people freely expressing their will in accordance with the Potsdam Declaration. Allied forces shall remain in Japan until the completion of the objectives set forth in the Potsdam Declaration.

Notification from the Japanese Government to China, the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union on August 14th, regarding the notification issued by the Japanese government on August 10th concerning the acceptance of the Potsdam terms and the response of the governments of China, the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union issued by US Secretary of State Byrnes on August 11th. The Japanese government has issued the following notification to the four nations:

1. The Emperor has issued a decree regarding the acceptance of the terms of the Potsdam Declaration.
2. The Emperor is prepared to grant the necessary authority to his government and the General Headquarters to implement all decisions regarding the Potsdam Declaration. In addition, the Emperor is prepared to issue all orders requested by the Supreme Commander of the Allied Forces to all Japanese land and sea forces and all troops under their command to cease hostilities, hand over weapons, and implement the above terms.

### All Lines of Central China Railway Trains Run as Usual Director Zheng Orders Subordinates to Diligently Perform Their Duties

Rumors that all lines of the Central China Railway Company have stopped running are inaccurate. All trains are running as usual and will not stop. Director Zheng of China Railway also gave instructions to his staff yesterday. The original text of the instructions is as follows:

"Now that the dawn of world peace has emerged, it is fortunate for mankind. We are engaged in railways and have always worked diligently for railways. Standing at our posts, we will not get involved in other matters. At this time of transition, all colleagues on the entire line should especially demonstrate the railway spirit, not allowing transportation to be interrupted for even a day, and strive to preserve this large part of the industry and prevent damage.

### Few Porridge and Many Monks Difficult Distribution Appeal to All Sectors to Continuously Donate Exam Results Are Mostly Excellent

The ninth session of new and impoverished students of the This Newspaper Readers' Scholarship Fund held a screening exam at Datong University on the 5th of this month. The exam papers have been reviewed and are about to be completed. According to the statistics, they are generally excellent. In terms of university enrollment, students majoring in science and engineering are the most outstanding. Among primary and secondary school students, seven or eight out of ten are above the standard. This makes us very satisfied and is worth comforting to the public who are enthusiastic about learning in society. Some people have doubted that students in various schools are studying in the midst of war, and all mental, material, and psychological conditions make people depressed. The decline in student performance is expected. However, in fact, it is a pleasant surprise, which proves that the students applying for the This Newspaper are able to study diligently and strive for progress in school, and they are all excellent students carefully recommended by the school authorities. Therefore, their achievements are beyond doubt.

The current problem is still the lack of donations, which is the regret that not all students can be subsidized! Prices have risen again in recent days, and tuition fees are expected to increase sharply next semester. Therefore, we are worried about "few porridge and many monks, difficult distribution". We also hope that people from all walks of life will take advantage of the celebration of peace, everyone will give their surplus, work together, and donate generously, so that the scholarship fund will increase, and the work will proceed more smoothly. The merit of saving all living beings and preparing talents for the country is not limited to thousands of children!

### Promoting the Consumption of Beans (2) Shanghai University of John College of Agriculture

According to the above table, the protein contained in all bean products is equivalent to that of beef and milk. The protein in eggs is far less than that of beans. The protein in soybeans is particularly abundant, accounting for 34%, which is more than the 30% in dried beef. Regarding fat, peanuts are especially rich, accounting for 38% to 48%, which is more than the 33.7% in butter. Soybeans are also rich in fat, accounting for 17%, which is more than that contained in eggs. As for carbohydrates, the percentage contained in beans is also very high. Peas contain 62%, cowpeas contain 60%, and soybeans contain 34%.

Uses of Beans

Ancient books extensively record. "Fang Pu" states: "Beans can be eaten, used for medicine, made into fermented soybeans, made into tofu. In famine years, people use them to fill their stomachs, and the waste from oil extraction can be used to fertilize the land and burned for fuel. The flower is called, when tender, it can be eaten as a vegetable." Also, Wang Zhen's "Agricultural Treatise" states: "Yellow beans can be made into tofu, can be used as sauce ingredients, soybean porridge and rice can all be mixed with food. White, black, and yellow beans are all saviors of the world. In the past, Zhang Yi, to unite the states for Qin, said to the King of Han: The land of Han is dangerous, the people live in the mountains and grow five grains, but what grows is not wheat but beans. What the people eat is mostly bean rice and bean soup." Also, in the biography of Ku Di Fu Ying in the Northern Qi Dynasty, there is mention of "On the day of the winter solstice, relatives and friends congratulate each other, and his wife prepares bean cakes." Also, in the biography of Wei Yan Zhi in the Tang Dynasty, there is also mention of "Guan Zhi lived in poverty, relying on bean porridge for sustenance."

Bean crops have been used as food since ancient times, and there are many ways to prepare them. They can be made into cakes and pastries, porridge and rice, cooked as vegetables, made into seasoning oils and sauces, or made into beverages. The uses are extremely wide. Europeans and Americans call them the staple food of Asians. Now, a table of the uses of beans is listed below: Uses of Soybeans Plant: 1. Green manure, 2. Animal feed (preserved dry grass), 3. Pasture, 4. Fuel, 5. Improve soil.

Seeds: 1. Soybean kernels: A. Food—bean rice, bean porridge, bean cakes, bean flour (used for making noodles, flatbread, biscuits, and noodles), tofu, soy milk, dried tofu, tofu skin, soy yogurt. B. Animal feed, fertilizer.

2. Soybean oil: A. Glycerin, gunpowder, enamel, paint, food (artificial butter substitute, cooking oil, salad oil), oilcloth, paint, soap raw materials, rubber substitutes, printing ink, fuel, lubricant, artificial ivory.

3. Products: A. Dried beans—soy sauce, bean soup, braised beans, substitute for fermented black soybeans. B. Fresh beans—vegetables, canned food, eaten raw.

Planting Methods

Ancient books state: "To plant soybeans, plow into rows and mounds, plant in spring, early in the third or fourth month, later in the fourth or fifth month. The soil should not be too fertile. If there are weeds, remove them. If weeds are not removed in time, they will consume the nutrients, and even if they bear fruit, it will not be much.

Winter soybeans are planted in the ninth month. The young seedlings that grow in winter can be eaten. The leaves are square and fat, hollow inside, and the shape of the leaves is like a spoon, round and not pointed, green on the front and white on the back. Originally, one stem has three leaves. In the second year, they bloom with moth-like, purple-white flowers and bear pods that hang down. The people of Shu harvest the seeds to prepare for famine."

Soybeans prefer a warm climate. During the growing period, maintain an average temperature above 15 degrees Celsius. Before flowering, although not suitable for warm and humid conditions, there must be occasional rain to help development. When flowering, the weather should be dry. Too much rain will cause the flowers to fall and not bear fruit.

Soybeans do not discriminate against soil and have the effect of improving the soil. Sandy loam is suitable, and alkaline soil rich in lime is even better. Too much fertilizer will reduce fruiting. However, fertilizer is suitable for plant ash because it contains 30% to 40% lime, a small amount of phosphate, and 5% potassium. Potassium can increase the size of the soybean grains, phosphorus can increase the harvest, and lime can neutralize the soil and increase the activity of rhizobia.

Before sowing, the land should be prepared, plowed, and leveled before sowing. The timing must be determined according to the local climate. In the south, sowing can be done in both spring and summer, but the early beans yield less, while the late beans yield more. The amount of seed sown is two to five liters per mu. The sowing method is mostly spot sowing, planting one plant every foot to one foot and a half. Use a stick to make a hole, and put two or three seeds in each hole when sowing. Wait until later to thin them out. Sowing should be shallow, with two inches as the standard, and slightly deeper in sandy loam.

To ensure that soybeans grow healthily and develop perfectly, it is essential to cultivate, remove weeds, and loosen the soil. After sowing soybeans, they can germinate in about a week or so. It is most appropriate to cultivate three times, that is, the first cultivation when the seedlings are half an inch high, the second cultivation when they are three inches high, and the third cultivation when they are about six inches high. Cultivation must be stopped before the soybeans are about to bloom, otherwise the loss of branches will affect the yield.

The soybean harvest varies depending on the use. Currently, agricultural product prices are high, so harvesting pods and seeds is most important. When the lower leaves and pods turn yellow, they can be harvested. Harvesting too early will result in incomplete grain development, and too late will cause the pods to crack and the grains to be lost. Soybeans mature from the bottom of the plant upwards, so when the base turns yellow, the upper part is still green. The harvesting method is to cut off the soybean plants with a sickle or pull them out by hand and pile them into small bundles, which are hung on a rack to dry. Then use a flail to beat off the soybean grains. The yield per mu varies from place to place, but normally it yields about seven dou of soybean grains and about two dan of pods.

Broad beans are suitable for mild climates. They are sown in autumn and harvested in late spring of the following year. Clay soil is most suitable. In addition to row sowing, they can be mixed with wheat and barley. The sowing time is around October. First, soak the seeds in water to facilitate germination. Broad beans are all spot sown. The row spacing is two feet, and the plant spacing is one foot. About two or three seeds are sown in each hole. The amount of seed sown per mu is eight to nine liters. Because they are leguminous crops, ammonium fertilizers are not very suitable. Plant ash is most important, and it is advisable to cultivate twice, both before flowering. The harvest depends entirely on the use. When the seeds are young and tender, they can be picked and used as vegetables. When they are old and mature, they are pulled out by hand. After the whole branch is dry, the grains are threshed. The yield per mu varies, but on average, one shi is most common.

The above is a general overview of the nutrition and planting of soybeans and broad beans. If even small gardens can be utilized, in this time of expensive rice and scarce grain, it may be of some help to the poor and cold. It is hoped that people in society will not underestimate it. (The End)
