### Government's Preconditions for Ceasefire: Communist Troops Must Withdraw from Railway Lines; Restore Traffic to Allow Refugees to Return Home

[Our Newspaper Dispatch] San Francisco, 29th Broadcast: The Chinese Nationalist and Communist parties did not continue negotiations today. This is because the Central Government has not yet been able to respond to the Communist Party's request for a ceasefire. It is reported that the Central Government will demand that the Communist Party withdraw from the railway lines before a ceasefire, with police maintaining order to restore traffic.

[United Press Chongqing, 29th Dispatch] The scheduled second meeting between the Nationalist and Communist parties did not take place today. It was learned from authoritative sources that the meeting did not take place because the National Government authorities had not yet responded to the Communist Party's demand to end the civil war. The official explanation was that Foreign Minister Wang Shijie's cocktail party for Special Envoy Marshall was also being held at the same time, so there was no time for a meeting. According to authoritative sources, the National Government can generally accept the Communist military's ceasefire request, but with an important condition: the Communist military must withdraw from the areas they occupy along the railways. The National Government believes this is necessary to restore traffic so that refugees can continuously return home. The National Government also agreed to send railway police to maintain order in the railway areas in place of the military. More optimistic political figures said that all important issues can be discussed and resolved in Nationalist-Communist negotiations, and the Political Consultative Conference will only become a formal stepping stone.

[Associated Press Chongqing, 29th Dispatch] As the old year is about to end, whether China's future will be one of peaceful unification or a full-scale civil war remains uncertain. However, hopes here are quite strong. U.S. Special Envoy to China Marshall has been here for eight days and has expressed extreme optimism, believing that the Nationalists and Communists are currently continuing to make unprecedented concessions. However, pessimists believe that the future Political Consultative Conference, which will discuss the outstanding issues between the Nationalists and Communists in an attempt to resolve them once and for all, may not achieve anything. All political figures who have spoken with Marshall have formed the impression that he is more familiar with the background of today's various problems than he admits.

Government Suggested Ceasefire Earlier; Communist Party Now Realizes Its Military Strength is Insufficient to Incite Rebellion; Suddenly Changes Attitude to Buy Time

[Reuters Chongqing, 29th Dispatch] When the Nationalists and Communists resume negotiations today, Chairman Chiang's response to the Communist Party's three-point ceasefire proposal is expected to be presented. At the same time, a government spokesperson (not a representative in the Nationalist-Communist negotiations) has refuted the Communist Party's proposal. According to the spokesperson, the National Government had already made such proposals on October 21st. The Communist Party now knows that its military strength is insufficient to defeat our side, so it has to suddenly change its attitude. The urgent problems that the whole country and the National Government are eager to solve now are the restoration of transportation lines, the disarmament of Japanese troops, and the repatriation of Japanese soldiers and civilians. The government suggested six weeks ago that the Communist forces withdraw six miles from the railway, and the railway lines would be guarded by the police. The government intends to notify the Communist Party in advance when it intends to transport troops along the railway lines. It is expected that the government will still insist on these two principles during this negotiation. According to reliable sources, Zhou Enlai discussed the Political Consultative Conference and the two major issues of Northeast China, etc., during a two-hour meeting with Special Envoy Marshall on Thursday.

[U.S. Information Service Chongqing, 28th Dispatch] New York Herald Tribune reporter Steele said today that Chairman Chiang is considering the formal written ceasefire proposal of the Chinese Communist Party. A Communist Party spokesperson told reporters that the document was presented last night during a two-hour meeting between representatives of the Nationalist and Communist parties. The Communist Party refused to release the original text of their written proposal last night, only saying that the government had agreed to forward the proposal to Chairman Chiang, and that a second meeting would be convened on Saturday or Sunday for further review and consideration of the various issues under consideration. The content of last night's meeting has not yet been revealed, and the government is keeping silent about the proposals made by its representatives. Although the government, like the Communist Party, has expressed an eagerness for the war to stop immediately, it insists on restoring railway traffic and the Communist military withdrawing from railway sections under their control or threat to a certain distance. The government is most concerned about being able to transport troops and supplies along the North China Railway without obstruction. The success or failure of the recent ceasefire negotiations may depend on the extent to which the Communist Party is willing to compromise on the railway traffic issue. The Communist Party said that their proposal is unconditional, but the public will make its own judgment after the full text of the proposal is published. Last night's meeting was the first formal meeting between Nationalist and Communist representatives since the Communist representatives returned here from Yan'an two weeks ago. This is one of several meetings to clear obstacles for the Political Consultative Conference. It is believed that the discussion of convening the Political Consultative Conference was also on the agenda last night. The government representatives were Zhang Qun and Shao Lizi, Secretary-General of the National Political Council, and the Communist representatives were Zhou Enlai, Ye Jianying, and Wang Ruofei, etc. U.S. Special Envoy Marshall invited Communist representative Zhou Enlai to lunch yesterday to listen to the details of the political situation in China, and then attended the welcome banquet of U.S. Chargé d'Affaires Robertson, where Marshall met with representatives of the Kuomintang, the Communist Party, the Democratic League, and non-partisan figures.

### Post and Telecommunications and Train Fares in North China: New Prices Temporarily Postponed

[Central News Agency Beiping, 29th Dispatch] Premier Song's visit to Beiping places great emphasis on stabilizing prices. It has recently been decided that the implementation of new prices for post and telecommunications and train fares in North China on New Year's Day will be temporarily postponed.

[Associated Press Beiping, 29th Dispatch] The ever-increasing cost of living is the greatest source of suffering for the people of North China today. Although prices once fell, they rebounded in October. Salaried workers are particularly affected, and even former university professors are pulling rickshaws. Their monthly salary of 20,000 yuan in puppet regime currency is only worth four U.S. dollars. Civil servants here are divided into two types, one sent from Chongqing and the other locally recruited, with different treatments, which is also a cause of unrest. The Kuomintang's Beiping Chronicle recommends increasing the salaries of local employees based on the cost of living index. The unemployment problem cannot be solved due to the Nationalist-Communist issue. It is estimated that there are 100,000 unemployed people in Beiping alone. The government has started unemployment registration in Beiping, but there is no direct relief measure yet. The Chronicle urges Premier Song to pay attention to one point, roughly saying: "If these people are unemployed for a long time, they may be conscripted by the Chinese Communists. The government should not hold their past against them and allow them to start anew."

### UNRRA Aid to China: Reconsidering Allocation Amounts; Results Expected to be Announced in Ten Days

[Associated Press Washington, 28th Dispatch] The China Branch Office of the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) in the United States stated that UNRRA has announced a $675 million relief plan for China and hopes to increase the relief amount again soon. China is not satisfied with the current plan because the decision on its allocation was not on an equal footing with other recipient countries, nor did it take into account the large number of people in need of relief. The UNRRA Design Subcommittee is currently reconsidering China's allocation amount, and the results may be announced in ten days. China has requested $945 million from UNRRA, believing it to be very fair. Compared to the $272.7 million in foreign exchange relief that China is promoting itself, it is only a small part. This relief is expected to be implemented in one or two years.

[Central News Agency Reporter Liu Zhuzhou, Shenyang, 27th] On the evening of my arrival, I had a long conversation with Soviet City Defense Commander Major General Gavrilov, officers Zhatov, and Grigorov. Hege spoke fluent Chinese and could write neat Chinese characters. They are very fond of Chinese literature, especially translations of ancient literature. The first Russian translation of Dream of the Red Chamber was by Ge. Major General Gavrilov is a generous drinker and talker, and told the reporter many stories about his contact with people from all walks of life since arriving in Shenyang. He said that he had met with three imposters each for the positions of governor, mayor, and police chief, but only today did he meet with the real representatives of the Central Government. He very much hopes that the National Army will arrive soon and that the Central News Agency will send a reporter to be stationed permanently in Shenyang. I told him that my companion, currently in Jinzhou, could come here, and asked if there were any trains from here to Jinzhou. He said that he was only responsible for the Shenyang area and did not know about anything else. Gao was originally an engineer. He pays close attention to public utilities and is very concerned about the lives of the citizens, and he is particularly willing to do his best to promote Sino-Soviet friendship. He acknowledged that in the past, many conspirators had used the Soviet army as a shield to seize political power, but he never regarded them as his targets. The Soviet officers and soldiers I contacted here are all enthusiastic and lively and have a deep understanding of China's situation. They all strongly believe that the permanent friendship between China and the Soviet Union is a factor for permanent world peace. The reporter asked Commander Gavrilov what he wanted to say to the Chinese people. He said: Only one sentence, that is, the thorough and unreserved friendly coexistence between China and the Soviet Union.

### Meeting of Three Foreign Ministers Breaks the Impasse; Meeting of Five Powers to be Held Next Month; Great Improvement in US-UK-Soviet Relations

[United Press, New York, 29th] The New York Times reported today that the five powers, China, the United States, Britain, the Soviet Union, and France, may hold their first meeting in London next month to discuss various plans to determine the necessary international forces to maintain peace. The various plans are currently being discussed through diplomatic channels. The British government is in a leading position, but it is not yet known whether other major powers such as China, the United States, the Soviet Union, and France will accept. An early meeting of the five powers is of great significance. Currently, all countries have permanent post-war military equipment, and the biggest consideration of the meeting will be the question of the number of land, sea, and air forces. The five major countries will all be asked to contribute to the military equipment of the United Nations organization.

[United Press, London, 29th] Diplomatic circles here hope that a meeting of military representatives of the five powers will be held in January to discuss the establishment of an international peace security force in accordance with the provisions of the United Nations Charter. The British Foreign Office neither denies nor confirms the convening of this meeting. However, authoritative sources speculate that after the United Nations General Assembly convenes on January 10 and forms the Security Council, the Military Committee will meet as soon as possible.

[United Press, Moscow, 29th] After the end of the meeting of the three foreign ministers, various steps have been taken to implement the agreement. According to well-informed sources, the following developments will take place within 48 hours after the end of the meeting: (1) Representatives of the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union will depart for Bucharest to implement the agreement on Romania. (2) The Soviet government will notify Bulgaria to request the reorganization of the cabinet. (3) An order will be issued to the US and Soviet military commanders in Korea to establish a joint committee to comply with the resolutions of the three parties. (4) The United Nations organization will be notified with official documents regarding the atomic agreement.

[Central News Agency, London, 28th Special Dispatch] Since the meeting of the five foreign ministers in October fell into a stalemate, the general mood has been quite pessimistic for three months. However, after the official announcement of the great achievements made by the foreign ministers of the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union at the Moscow meeting at 3:00 AM this morning, the belief that international cooperation can be achieved in the future has been strengthened. General commentary, with a few exceptions, is optimistic. Most observers regard this meeting as an "amazing achievement" and a "new development of peace." Since the Potsdam Declaration, the entire United Kingdom has not expressed such joy for any official announcement as it has for this Moscow communiqué. Generally wise observers acknowledge that the Soviet side and the British and American sides at the meeting demonstrated significant mutual concessions and coordination, but some critics emphasize that the British and American concessions to the Soviet Union were greater.

[Central News Agency Reporter Tang Dechen, New York, 27th] The initial reaction of the United States, both the government and the public, to the Moscow communiqué can be described as "cautious optimism." Most believe that the Moscow agreement will have a far-reaching impact on the general atmosphere of cooperation between the three countries, especially between the United States and the Soviet Union. However, American commentators quickly pointed out the difficulties that often arise in implementing agreements after previous meetings, and that another meeting must be held in the end. The results of this meeting are considered satisfactory. (1) The three foreign ministers have broken the deadlock in the London Foreign Ministers' Conference. (2) The Foreign Ministers' Conference will be convened again. (3) The 21 countries that previously participated in the European war will discuss the European peace treaty issue, regardless of whether the meeting is under the control of the three countries. (4) Progress has been made in resolving the stumbling blocks between the three countries, especially between the United States and the Soviet Union, on the control of Japanese atomic bombs and the occupation of Korea and the China issue. Realists observe that the outcome of this meeting is considered a victory for the Soviet Union, as the Soviet Union has always insisted that the future post-war settlement plan, even if not entirely decided by the three countries, should also give the three countries special privileges. However, on the other hand, these realists comforted themselves that the British and American concessions to the Soviet Union had been compensated for, that is, the Soviet Union's enhanced cooperation with the United Nations organization and the resolution of global issues should be done in a multifaceted way. It is believed that mutual suspicion between the United States and the Soviet Union will be eliminated as a result. In summary, Americans believe that the Moscow agreement is a major step forward, but hope that this time, the problem of interpretation of terms arising from the implementation of the agreement will not occur again as it did before.

### Keeping Atomic Bomb Secrets; The United States Has Not Changed Its Original Intention

[United Press, Washington, 29th] President Truman will support a gradual disclosure of atomic energy secrets, more cautiously than the initial impression indicated by the Moscow Three-Nation Communiqué. The President, who had just returned from a Christmas holiday reunion with his family in Missouri, had spoken with those who interpreted the plan to establish an international atomic energy management committee in this way. It is said that Truman advocates that the United States should always know that small secrets are not misused before more important secrets can be revealed. Conversations within the President's Office and the State Department indicate that US policy will first test the proposed inspection methods, and then inform any country of all secrets regarding the atomic bomb, except for Britain and Canada. Republican Senator Vandenberg stated that the State Department had told him that the international committee dealing with atomic energy issues required full security. Vandenberg, a member of the Senate Atomic Energy Special Committee, advocated retaining this secret until it is proven that international management can prevent it from being used for military applications. The Moscow Three-Nation Conference Communiqué proposed four points for the proposed committee, which will be established by the United Nations organization and be responsible to the World Security Council. Its four points are as follows: (1) Exchange of basic scientific information between countries; (2) Management of atomic energy to ensure its use for peaceful purposes; (3) Elimination of atomic bombs and other bombs that can cause massive destruction; (4) Establish effective guarantees through inspection and other methods to protect complying countries, prevent risks, sabotage and circumvention. Vandenberg said that the reason he opposed the communiqué was that its original intention was not to make this goal implemented in the order of the four points proposed, but all should be read together, and each point should have the necessary full security, and all must be finally approved by Congress. His proposition will be generally accepted in Congress.

[United Press, Washington, 28th] Before leaving Moscow, Byrnes expressed in a warning tone that the United States had not given up any of its secrets regarding the atomic bomb, but he did make it clear that the United States was willing to take the lead in obtaining peacetime applications of atomic energy.

[United Press, Washington, 28th] Regarding the Moscow Conference's resolution on the atomic energy issue, Democratic Senator Vandenberg announced today after meeting with President Truman and Acting Secretary of State Acheson that, according to official opinion, every step in dealing with the atomic energy issue will be premised on "complete security," and it is guaranteed that each stage will be finally approved by Congress.

[United Press, Washington, 28th] The members of the Senate Atomic Energy and Foreign Affairs Committees all stated that they wanted to know more details about the agreement established at the Moscow Three-Nation Foreign Ministers' Conference. Republican Senator Austin told reporters that there was a "very strong feeling" in the Atomic Energy Committee that it must proceed slowly, that is, no detailed information on the application of atomic energy to industry could be disclosed or exchanged until effective control methods were found to ensure that atomic energy would no longer be used for destruction. The application of atomic energy in industry accounts for three-quarters of the atomic bomb manufacturing process.

### Measures Against Japan; MacArthur Did Not Criticize

[Central Press Agency, Tokyo, 29th Special Dispatch] MacArthur has not yet made any detailed comments on the Moscow resolution to set up an Allied Commission for Japan in Tokyo and a Far East Commission in Washington to exclusively control Japan. The MacArthur Headquarters Liaison Bureau's unofficial report yesterday afternoon stated that MacArthur had been notified in advance of the Moscow resolutions. However, the reporter's observation of the headquarters situation showed that people were surprised by the communiqué of the Three-Nation Foreign Ministers' Conference.

Japan Panicked and Dispirited

[United Press, London, 28th] The various resolutions of the Moscow Three-Nation Foreign Ministers' Conference have been published. All sectors in Japan have expressed panic and dismay in discussing this matter. Most observers expressed fear about the creation of an international management agency for Japan. A certain Japanese newspaper stated: The Japanese like and trust General MacArthur, and are now afraid that some of his policies will be hindered by China and the Soviet Union. The Japanese have long been educated and cannot help but fear and suspect these two countries. In Tokyo, fears about the fate of Emperor Hirohito are also growing. All sectors in Japan recall that China and the Soviet Union had previously proposed plans to force the Japanese Emperor to abdicate.

Koreans Oppose Trusteeship System

[United Press, Washington, 28th] The American Korea Committee stated today that the three powers' plan to govern Korea for five years "is an evil scheme, in which there cannot be free existence." Committee Chairman Colonel Lin said: This plan "is contrary to the goals that the people of China, the United States, the Soviet Union, and Britain sacrificed their lives to fight for in this war. These people sacrificed their lives for freedom, but the trusteeship system is not freedom, but supervision and rule."

### Bulgarian Foreign Minister Announces; Acceptance of Soviet Proposal

[United Press, Sofia, 29th] Bulgarian Foreign Minister Stanov announced to the National Assembly today that the Bulgarian government accepted the Soviet proposal to expand the government organization to accommodate representatives of all parties to participate, and that it would faithfully implement the resolutions of the three foreign ministers.

### Spokesperson of Our Government; Talking About the Three-Nation Conference; Fully Agreed on Deciding Japan's Fate; Trusteeship of Korea Will Actually Help Independence

[United Press, Chongqing, 29th] The spokesperson of the Chinese government said this afternoon: China fully agrees with the Moscow communiqué's proposal to establish an advisory committee in Washington and a four-power committee in Tokyo to decide the fate of Japan after the war. The spokesperson said that the various proposals accepted by the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs have been concretely summarized in the Moscow communiqué concerning the control of Japan. He continued: "We believe that close cooperation between the Allied powers is necessary in this matter. The Moscow communiqué will be a test of cooperation between the Allied powers." The spokesperson said: "China has always hoped that Korea will become a free and independent country. We believe that a fixed period of trusteeship can help Korea achieve independence."

[United Press, London, 28th] The Chinese in Chongqing welcomed the various agreements of the Three-Nation Foreign Ministers' Conference, especially those related to China, hoping to safeguard China's sovereignty in the Northeast provinces and strengthen China's hope for peaceful unification. Regarding the agreement on the early withdrawal of US and Soviet troops, the Chinese believe that the withdrawal of Soviet troops will inevitably be delayed, and the US troops will withdraw immediately after the Japanese troops surrender, disarm, and are sent back home. Regarding the Korean issue, Chinese officials believe that China has always advocated Korean independence, but does not agree to divide Korea into US and Soviet-controlled zones during the five-year trusteeship period.

### President Truman; Listens to Byrnes' Report

[Central News Agency, Washington, 28th] Washington today generally believes that the Foreign Ministers' Conference agreement is another "milestone" for world peace. Washington officials and diplomatic circles are celebrating the breaking of the deadlock since the failure of the London Foreign Ministers' Conference. It is believed that the relations between the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union have greatly improved, and that the resolution of several major world problems currently anxious in Washington will make the hope for international cooperation brighter when the United Nations General Assembly is held on January 10 next year. President Truman returned to Washington from Missouri today. He will receive Byrnes' report, who is scheduled to arrive here tomorrow. President Truman will take the presidential yacht to Chesapeake Bay, 45 miles south of Washington, for five days tomorrow. Before Byrnes returns, the State Department refused to explain or clarify the many questions asked about the Allied Commission for Japan and the restrictions imposed on MacArthur. Truman's press liaison secretary Ross told the press today that the White House has not had enough time to obtain a national reaction, but so far has not received satisfactory criticism.

### Representatives of Five Countries Open; German Embassy and Consulate Archives

[Reuters, Istanbul, 29th] The German archives of the former German Embassy in Turkey and consulates in various places will be opened by a committee jointly formed by Turkey, Britain, the United States, the Soviet Union, and France.

### Tojo to Be Tried

Intend to Ask Former Subordinates to Testify

[This Newspaper, Tokyo, 29th Special Dispatch] It is reported that the Japanese government recently requested permission for the Japanese side to send three representatives from outside the province to China in order to deal with the issue of compensation for losses in the war against China, Britain, and the United States. This rumor has been denied here. In addition, the Japanese government requested the Allied forces to send three former Tojo secretaries back to Japan from China. They have been sent back to the Japanese government liaison office and must be submitted again at an appropriate time. The names of Tojo's three secretaries are as follows: (1) Akamatsu, (2) Nishio, (3) Hattori. It is said that the Japanese government intends to recall these three people in order to testify for Tojo. The Allied forces declared that this request was made by Tojo's lawyer and could be considered.

Abuse of Prisoners and Excessive Torture

[United Press, Yokohama, 29th] Yuri, the chief of the Japanese Omura Prisoner-of-War Camp, is being tried for killing British and American prisoners of war. The military court has ordered the prosecutor to send a telegram to the United States to obtain all sworn statements from important witnesses. Today, Sergeant Fied testified in court that the torture commonly used by Japanese guards was to apply a gelatinous substance to the prisoners' arms and then stick ignited wooden pieces to it. When the wooden pieces burned out, the gelatinous substance caught fire, causing unbearable pain. This torture was also applied to the neck, ears, and other parts, and even to the entire body.

### British Cabinet to Hear Bevin's Report Next Week; Bevin to Brief Attlee First; Next Meeting in Washington in March

[Reuters, London, 28th] The British Cabinet will hear Foreign Secretary Bevin's full report on the Council of Foreign Ministers meeting on January 2nd. Bevin is likely to visit Prime Minister Attlee's country residence to give the Prime Minister a direct and simple briefing on the meeting. The next meeting will be held in Washington in March next year. While there is general satisfaction with the global resolution of the international deadlock and the hope of reaching an era of world peace and security, British and American figures still criticize the initial reaction of U.S. government personnel on certain areas and details, such as the Korean issue, and seem quite disappointed that Korea did not immediately achieve complete independence. However, the U.S. representative in Moscow believes that the agreements reached with the Soviet Union on various matters indicate the greatest progress in U.S.-Soviet relations.

[United Press, Manila, 28th] During the trial of Ota, the former commander of the Japanese military police in the Philippines, a witness testified today that the Japanese lined up Chinese Consul General Yang Guang-sheng and seven other Chinese victims in front of a pre-prepared grave before shooting them. One of the witnesses in attendance was a special police officer, Bayang, and the other was Tuosi, who was in charge of the Chinese cemetery. It was claimed that the execution date was April 12, 1942. After Yang Guang-sheng and the others were killed, their bodies were all pushed into a grave eight meters long and one and a half meters wide, which the Japanese then covered with ash and soil.

### All-India Women Fight for Freedom

[Reuters, London, 29th] Lady Lawrence, wife of Lord Lawrence, the head of the India Office, addressed the All-India Women's Conference meeting here, saying: "I have also participated in the struggle for freedom and have been arrested six times and participated in a hunger strike once. Therefore, I express my utmost sympathy for your association's freedom aspirations. The promises made by the British government are made in genuine sincerity. I sincerely hope that your association will dispel feelings of distrust and give us a little more time. The British government will surely make the aspirations that you and I enthusiastically hope for a reality."

### Britain Decides to Help the Netherlands Restore Order in the East Indies, Promotes Understanding in Indo-Dutch Negotiations; Anglo-Dutch Talks End, Communiqué Issued

[Central News Agency, London, 29th, Reuters] The Anglo-Dutch talks on the Indonesian issue have now ended. A statement issued by the Prime Minister's Office at 10 Downing Street said that the British government reiterated its obligation to assist its Dutch ally in establishing security as soon as possible, so that the Dutch-Indonesian governments can continue negotiations with Indonesian representatives. The British and Dutch governments have discussed policies to promote understanding between Indonesian nationalist leaders and Dutch authorities. Other steps will also be taken immediately to ensure the safety of prisoners of war and detained expatriates in Indonesia.

[Reuters, London, 29th] Dutch Indies Vice-Governor Van Mook told a group of reporters yesterday: "After returning to Java, the solutions I intend to propose to the Indonesian leaders have been discussed in detail with the Dutch government and have been approved by them. I expect the Indonesian leaders to accept these suggestions. After carefully studying the matter with my country's authorities during my return, I have revised the suggestions I made to the Indonesian leaders in November." Although the details of the recent Dutch plan have not been obtained, it is believed that it proposes the establishment of a republic consisting of the entire East Indies archipelago, maintaining contact with the Netherlands, drafting a constitution for it, and giving the people of the East Indies full autonomy in handling their internal affairs. However, defense, diplomacy, and other important matters must still be handled jointly with the government in The Hague. The communiqué issued after the Anglo-Dutch talks indicates that the British side is deeply convinced that the Indonesian issue can be resolved through direct negotiations between Indonesian and Dutch leaders. However, British troops in Java will continue to perform guard duties to limit the activities of extremists and protect the safety of expatriates. Van Mook clarified the rumors that he had a dispute with the Dutch government, saying that the Dutch Indies government and the government in The Hague are far apart, and different views are sometimes inevitable, but there are no differences in the essential elements of policy.

### Mexico Advocates Racial Equality

[United Press, Mexico City, 28th] The Mexican Lower House passed a resolution yesterday calling on the parliaments of all countries and United Nations agencies to abolish racial and color discrimination. After the bill is passed by the Upper House, it will be promulgated in the name of the Mexican Parliament. The resolution stated that the Nazi Party's claim of racial superiority led to World War II, so Mexico's international policy is based on the equality of all mankind and all races in the world. True global ethnic cooperation and true guarantees against future wars should not recognize any difference between Europeans, Asians, Indo-Americans, blacks, or Jews. Only when all mankind and all races are completely equal can peace develop humanity, culture, and civilization.

### Our Ambassador to the United States Meets with Acheson

### Japanese Assets in the United States to Be Fully Confiscated

[United Press, Washington, 29th] All the assets of Japanese residents in the United States were frozen by the Treasury Department at the beginning of the war. Chairman Markham of the Foreign Property Custodian Committee ordered today that these assets be reported and announced that they would be confiscated as soon as the reports were received. According to Markham, this is part of the government's plan to eliminate Japan's economic power within the country. Reports on the assets of Japanese residents in Hawaii and the Philippines will be submitted to local branch offices of the Custodian Committee.

### Japanese Constitutional Experts Draft a Revised Draft Constitution, Transferring the Emperor's Ruling Power to Parliament; Whether Shidehara Agrees is Still in Question

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 28th] The revised draft of the Japanese Constitution has been submitted to the Japanese cabinet by constitutional experts. The draft contains various innovative changes, and all privileges of the Japanese imperial family will also be returned to the people. Tokyo newspapers have published the draft in a prominent position, as it is the first draft prepared to date. This revised draft was drafted by Japanese constitutional authorities Hozumi Suzuki and Professor Mitsujiro Sugino of Waseda University. It transfers ruling power from the hands of the Emperor to Parliament. The Emperor will only preside over national ceremonies and rituals, and Parliament will have the power to approve the Emperor's accession and appoint a regent. The current privileges of Emperor Showa will also be transferred to Parliament. The Speakers of both the House of Representatives and the House of Peers will also have the power to recommend a new Prime Minister. However, it seems unlikely that the above points will be included in the final revised constitution currently being drafted by the Shidehara Cabinet, as Shidehara and Foreign Minister Yoshida both insist that the Japanese Constitution does not need to be thoroughly revised and can be adapted to the current national conditions. Only the part that was previously abused needs to be revised. Both stated that the current constitution is already democratic. The Constitution Problem Investigation Committee of the Japanese Cabinet held its sixth meeting at the Prime Minister's official residence yesterday to discuss the provisional draft of the revised constitution. The committee will continue to hold meetings during the New Year.

### War Profits Tax Plan Also Drafted

[United Press, Tokyo, 29th] According to Japanese sources today, the Ministry of Finance has completed a war profits tax plan, which is expected to collect 100 billion Japanese yen. The plan is scheduled to be submitted to the Supreme Commander of the United Nations for approval on the 31st of this month. The Ministry of Finance drafted this plan because MacArthur issued instructions to collect a war profits tax of 10% to 100% and a property tax of 10% to 70%, so that the Japanese would know that there was no profit to be made from the war. In addition, there are two actions in response to MacArthur's instructions. It is expected that the Ministry of Health and Welfare will issue a special instruction today that the occupational wages and working conditions of workers will not be affected by national education or social status. Prefectural governors and other officials will regularly inspect civilian enterprises, and government departments will also be responsible for implementation. The Emperor will also issue an edict today stipulating that those who violate the order prohibiting various aviation training should be punished, with a maximum penalty of three years' imprisonment and a fine of 5,000 Japanese yen. The final details of the plan have not yet been announced, but it is said that individuals will be subject to war profits tax from 1940, and judicial personnel from 1937.

Old Shidehara Falls Ill

[Reuters, Tokyo, 29th] Japanese Prime Minister Shidehara, aged 73, has been seriously ill for four days due to a severe cold. After being treated with penicillin by MacArthur's personal doctor, his condition has improved today.

This women's group and thirty other associations, although named political parties, are actually more like small political organizations with varying influence, but in Japan, such women's groups are still a novelty.

### New Drug Invented to Treat Epilepsy

[United Press, Chicago, 28th] The Journal of the American Medical Association published a new drug for treating epilepsy, called Tridione.

This drug is the most effective method tried for treating epilepsy.

### Full Text of the Communiqué of the Council of Foreign Ministers (Continued from Yesterday)

Fifth: Regarding Romania

The governments of the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union are prepared to offer advice to King Michael of Romania, advising the King to expand the Romanian government to include one member of the National Peasant Party and one member of the Liberal Party. The following committee

(1) must genuinely represent the groups or parties in opposition.

(2) must cooperate loyally with the government. The U.S., British, and Soviet governments, paying attention to the reorganized Romanian government, should announce free and unimpeded elections, in which all anti-fascist parties have the right to participate. The government should guarantee freedom of reporting, speech, religion, and assembly. Deputy People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Vyshinsky, U.S. Ambassador Harriman, and British Ambassador Kerr are authorized to form a committee to go to the capital of Romania to consult with King Michael and current government officials in order to implement the above-mentioned tasks. Once these tasks are completed and the necessary guarantees are obtained, the U.S. and British governments will recognize the Romanian government that maintains diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union.

Sixth: Bulgaria

The three governments understand that the Soviet government is willing to take responsibility for contributing friendly advice to the Bulgarian government, namely that the current Fatherland Front government of Bulgaria should include representatives of other democratic groups. These representatives:

(A) genuinely represent the groups or parties in the opposition. Once the British and American governments are convinced that this friendly advice has indeed been accepted by the Bulgarian government and that the aforementioned representatives have indeed been included in the Bulgarian government, the British and American governments will recognize the Bulgarian government that already has diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union.

Seventh: The United Nations Organizes an Atomic Energy Control Commission

Regarding the discussion of the atomic energy issue and the establishment of a committee by the United Nations General Assembly, the foreign ministers of the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union have agreed to recommend to the United Nations General Assembly that the United Nations organize a committee to consider the various issues arising from the discovery of atomic energy, as well as related matters, and have agreed to invite other permanent members of the Security Council (namely China and France) and Canada to jointly participate in initiating the following resolution at the first meeting of the United Nations General Assembly to be held in January next year: The United Nations General Assembly resolves to establish a committee to handle all issues arising from the discovery of atomic energy, as well as other related matters. The organization and qualifications of the committee are as follows.

(1) Establish a committee to be established by the General Assembly in accordance with the conditions of Article 5 below.

(2) The relationship between the committee and the United Nations agencies (A) The committee must submit its reports and recommendations to the Security Council. Such reports and recommendations must be made public unless the Council stipulates otherwise for the sake of peace and security. The Security Council shall forward these reports to the General Assembly and the member states of the United Nations, as well as to the Economic and Social Council within the Council itself.

(B) According to the United Nations Charter, the primary responsibility of the Security Council is to maintain international peace and security. Therefore, the Security Council should issue guidance on security issues to the committee. The committee shall consist of one representative from each representative state of the Security Council and Canada. Each representative on the committee may select the assistant he or she wishes to employ.

(3) Rules of procedure: The committee must employ the staff it deems necessary and must submit proposals for rules of procedure to the Security Council for approval.

(4) Terms of reference for the committee: The committee must continuously investigate all aspects of the issue and submit appropriate recommendations at any time, especially concrete recommendations.

(A) Expanding the international exchange of basic scientific intelligence for peaceful purposes.

(B) Controlling atomic energy to ensure that it is only used for peaceful purposes.

(C) Eliminating atomic weapons and other major weapons suitable for mass destruction.

(D) Effectively safeguarding signatory states from the harm of violating states through inspection and other methods.

The work of the committee should be carried out in stages. The successful completion of each stage will generate trust among the people of the world, and then the second stage will be carried out. The committee shall not infringe upon the responsibilities of any agency of the United Nations, but shall contribute recommendations to the agencies in order to complete their tasks under the provisions of the United Nations Charter. (End)

### Opinions of the U.S., Britain, and the Soviet Union on the Moscow Council of Foreign Ministers Meeting: Praised as a Major Step Forward for the World

[United Press, Washington, 28th] Newspapers in the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union today praised the achievements of the Moscow Council of Foreign Ministers meeting as a major step forward towards a truly peaceful world. The newspapers also unanimously called the atomic agreement the most important achievement. The issue of Japanese control received almost the same attention in Moscow and the United States, but was ignored in Britain. Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov was the victor in the Japanese control measures, so the comments in Moscow were the most enthusiastic. The News reported that the agreements were a new step in the direction of United Nations cooperation, without which there would be no stable peace. The tone of the London newspapers was also roughly the same, in stark contrast to the depression that filled the pages after the failure of the Five-Power Council of Foreign Ministers meeting in London in the autumn. Only the Daily Telegraph issued a warning, saying that it should not be assumed that all difficulties have been resolved. The London meeting was obviously too bad, and if the frank and friendly spirit that created this meeting cannot be maintained, then the Moscow meeting will also be too satisfactory and unbelievable. The Times called the meeting a remarkable success. The Daily Mail believed that there were excellent signs showing that countries were gradually regaining mutual trust and willing to compromise. The Washington Evening Star said that the United States had made major concessions, especially in the occupation policy of Japan. Because of this step, the resolution of Japan's various difficulties will no longer follow U.S. policy, and MacArthur has become the agent of the Far Eastern Commission. It is only hoped that Secretary of State Byrnes has obtained favorable treaties in exchange for this major step. The newspaper also reflected the general opinion that the atomic agreement may be the most important achievement of the meeting, but its effect remains to be proven by facts. A Soviet Pravda editorial stated that the organization of the Far Eastern Commission was of great significance. The Four-Power Control Committee for Japan was also necessitated by the facts. The Control Committee should eliminate attempts by Japanese warlords to preserve part of their strength. The San Francisco Chronicle stated that the atomic agreement has made the era of fear or international vigilance and distrust a thing of the past, restoring people's psychology and allowing the work of reconstruction and peaceful transformation to be carried out in a realistic mood. Regarding this matter, a United Press analyst cabled from London that the emergence of the atomic bomb had caused international concerns to grow and anxiety to increase. The failure of the previous Five-Power Council of Foreign Ministers meeting was undoubtedly caused by this. The decision of the Moscow meeting to remove these doubts shows that the meeting has achieved great success, but there seem to be several subtle and important difficult issues that have been left unresolved. The Soviet Union's relations with Iran and Turkey are among them. These two issues are of global importance and are full of gunpowder.

[United Press, New York, 28th] The Howard newspaper chain today opposed the Moscow agreement with a clear stance. One of its editorials stated: "The United States has again made major concessions to the Soviet Union, and has gained nothing for itself." One of the chain's writers, Raymond, said: "Whether it is a compromise or a plan, the agreement on the four-power control of Japan is extremely confusing. MacArthur may still be able to do something, but if someone with a slightly weaker spirit is put in his place, his hands and feet will be bound by the legislative straitjacket created by Moscow." The New York Sun said: "The true test of the Moscow agreement will be seen in the future. It is still unknown whether Byrnes and Bevin have explained that the Soviet Union has made mutual concessions for security." A Washington Post said: "The results of the Moscow meeting have curbed the deterioration of U.S.-Soviet relations. What has been agreed upon is that the Soviet Union has a voice in the Japanese Control Committee and the Far Eastern Commission. This approach will never interfere with MacArthur's daily administrative work." The Chicago Daily News said: "One of the most hopeful points of the entire agreement is that both the United States and the Soviet Union have announced that they will withdraw their troops from China as soon as possible."

### Local Dispatches

Kunshan

Supervisory Delegation of the Pacification Headquarters Dispatches Personnel for Supervision

In order to comprehensively expand the work of the Third Detachment of the Pacification Supervisory Corps of the Beijing-Shanghai Garrison, Detachment Commander Ye Wen recently selected and dispatched officers to be stationed in various counties for long-term supervision. They will widely set up complaint boxes to receive the public's grievances and other suggestions for improvement. On the afternoon of the 27th, a discussion meeting was held with the heads of various county agencies and local gentry to make careful decisions on the future direction of work.

Changshu

Promoting Winter Farming and Prohibiting Deforestation

The county government, considering that the countryside is devastated after the war, production is shrinking, and food for the people is worrisome, and that a large amount of timber is needed at the beginning of recovery, decided that if management is not strengthened, local people will become accustomed to short-term gains and will inevitably indiscriminately cut down forests, which will not only affect the promotion of afforestation, but also cause endless disasters in the countryside. Therefore, it has been decided to: (1) promote winter farming, and (2) strictly prohibit indiscriminate logging and implement measures to protect forest resources. On the 27th, all districts were notified to comply.

Suzhou

Thefts Frequently Heard Amidst Power Outages

The Suzhou Electric Plant has recently been unable to maintain a steady supply of electricity due to a shortage of coal. Daytime electricity has been completely cut off, and nighttime electricity is intermittent and unstable, and is being rationed by district every day. Citizens are complaining. On the night of the 27th, the electricity supply was almost completely cut off, with only the area around Guanqian West Central Market having a barely functioning supply. All other areas were in darkness. Therefore, incidents of theft and robbery have been occurring in Suzhou every day. On the night of the 27th, during the planned outage, the homes of Chen Yuanchang and two other families in Jiyou Lane in the city were robbed of significant losses. The police are investigating.

Liyang

Preparing to Organize a County Local Bank

Liyang is located in the center of the Beijing-Zhejiang National Highway and on the border of Zhejiang and Anhui provinces. Since the War of Resistance, it has been a military battleground. After repeated incursions by the enemy and puppet troops, the entire county was scorched. After the victory, it was again occupied by bandits. To promote construction and recovery, fellow villagers living abroad and local people, led by Mei Zi, have initiated preparations for organizing a county local bank, which can concentrate resources to assist the government in implementing everything.

Huzhou

Agreement Reached on House Rental Regulations

The business on Zhitong Second Road in Wuxing City was thriving, but the market has been sluggish since the incident. Now that the enemy has surrendered and the National Army has arrived in Huzhou, merchants and residents who had fled to avoid the war are returning to their hometowns one after another. The demand for housing exceeds the supply, causing frequent disputes over housing rentals and rents. After repeated negotiations between Zhuang Boying and other representatives of shops and residents on Zhitong Second Road and the person in charge of the Zhicheng Real Estate Company, an agreement has been reached. (1) For shop premises rented before the 26th year, the original rent will be increased by 50 times. (2) For shop premises rented from the 27th year to the date of victory, the original rent will be increased by 60 times. (3) For new shop premises and residential rents from September of this year, a reasonable increase will be made according to the market. (4) Residential rents will still be increased by 30 times based on the original rent before the war. These measures will be implemented from this month.

Nanchang

Branch Office Launches Relief Work

After the Jiangxi Branch of the China Relief and Rehabilitation Administration was established in Nanchang on November 16, it has successively sent 6,000 refugees back to their hometowns in various places within the first month (until the 16th of this month). In addition to setting up refugee stations in the two transportation hubs of Nanchang and Jiujiang, refugee stations have also been set up successively in Ji'an, Zhangshu, Linchuan, Ganzhou, Jiujiang, and other places, which not only facilitates refugees from Gan, but also benefits righteous people returning to their hometowns from Xiang, Yue, Min, Zhejiang, Yuan, E, and Beijing and Shanghai. In addition, it is also actively promoting rural urgent aid and free medical care. It is estimated that in the areas of northern Jiangxi that have been most severely affected, thatched houses have been built for homeless farmers, and clothing, bedding, and agricultural tools have been distributed, costing a total of 19,000,000 yuan in national currency. At present, there is not a single hospital in Gan that can be trusted. The branch office has actively subsidized various hospitals to provide free clinics as soon as possible, with a total of 2,000,000 yuan subsidized to Chinese and Western hospitals. The Jiujiang Women and Children's Hospital, which has received this subsidy, will provide free clinics on New Year's Day of the 35th year. In addition to the above three items, the branch office also plans to use work relief methods to restore the highways of Jiangxi and repair river channels, etc.

### As the National Territory Regains its Light and the National Army Advances: A Retrospective on the Fate of the Northeast, Unfolding the Current Undertaking of Reconstruction and Development. Part 1. Special Draft by the Newspaper's Research Department.

Every Chinese compatriot is craning their necks, their eyes wide open, closely watching the completion of the Northeast takeover and the advancement of the National Army's airlift operations. "When will the National Army be able to enter Shenyang?" is a burning question that has naturally formed in the minds of every compatriot in the Northeast and across the country. At the same time, with their firm confidence, they have long confirmed that this is a certain fact that is about to be realized. Precisely because this matter is bound to be realized, their expectations are even more intense and profound.

We all understand that the Northeast is an inseparable and indispensable part of our country. From the Open Door policy through the Nine-Power Treaty to the Cairo Conference held in recent years, whether it is a declaration or an agreement, they all uniformly presuppose that the Northeast is a major territory of our country, and expect that the Northeast will be the base for our country's industrialization and modernization. Therefore, what we are concerned with now is not when we will complete the restoration of our homeland after eight years of war, but how to restore and transform this long-suffering homeland, so as to become a guarantee of future peace and happiness rather than a source of future turmoil.

Under this basic understanding and important belief, tracing the fate of the Northeast has a profound meaning. Due to the scarcity of materials at hand, I will tentatively use the Northeast Foreign History Materials of the Northeast Investigation Bureau of the Central Design Bureau as a model, and add my own humble opinions to make a brief overview.

Historical Traces

China's Northeast, also known historically as Manchuria, is located in the central part of eastern Asia, roughly between 120 and 135 degrees east longitude and 40 and 53 degrees north latitude. This area had relations with mainland China as early as the Zhou Dynasty, and continued through successive dynasties. However, the Manchu people and the Han people of China did not achieve complete spiritual integration until the Qing Dynasty entered the Pass, through geographical connection and economic interconnection. The so-called spiritual integration refers to the integration of bloodlines, culture, thought, and living habits.

It is estimated that 99% of the Manchus have been assimilated with the Han people, and most of them have entered the Pass with the Qing Dynasty and are scattered in the inland eighteen provinces, as well as Xinjiang, Inner Mongolia, and other places. After three or four hundred years of integration, it is no longer possible to distinguish between Manchu and Han. According to statistics from the enemy, Japan, the current population of the Northeast is about 43 million. It is estimated that more than 90% of them are of Han descent, the rest are of mixed Han-Manchu descent, and the aforementioned small number of pure natives.

Before the September 18th Incident in 1931, China had never had any disputes with its neighbors Japan and the Soviet Union due to borders. The source of the disputes lies elsewhere.

Japan and Russia's Covetousness

In 1894, China and Japan lost harmony and started a war due to the internal turmoil in Korea. The war in 1895 ended with the defeat of our country. The Treaty of Shimonoseki forced China to cede the Liaodong Peninsula as part of Japan's compensation. Japan's ambition to invade the East Asian continent originated from this. At the same time, the Tsarist Russian Empire, which also had ambitious ambitions and always wanted to get involved, was also eyeing this part of Chinese territory. Long before the Sino-Japanese War, Russia had been eyeing China's Northeast and the Korean coast. When Japan advanced into Liaodong, Tsarist Russia could not stand idly by, so it united with Germany and France to intervene and force it to return.

The Sino-Russian Secret Agreement of 1896 was the price demanded by Russia for intervening in the return of Liaodong. According to this agreement, China allowed Russia to build a railway in the northern part of the three eastern provinces (i.e., the Chinese Eastern Railway), the two ends of which should be connected to its Siberian Railway (construction began in 1891 and was largely completed in 1901). Therefore, the construction of the railway gave Russia many special rights and interests, such as the land rights of the so-called zone, the right to protect the railway with military police, the right to municipal police, administrative and judicial rights, the right to exploit forests, and the right to lay electric wires near the railway, as well as tax exemptions, tax reductions, and educational rights.

In 1898, taking advantage of China's troubles, Tsarist Russia further demanded the construction of a branch line of the Chinese Eastern Railway, starting from Harbin in the north and ending in Dalian in the south, and demanded that Lushun and Dalian be leased territories. In 1900, taking advantage of the Boxer Rebellion in China, it sent troops to the Northeast. After the incident, it delayed the withdrawal of troops, finally leading to the Russo-Japanese War of 1904-1905. In this battle, Russia was defeated and concluded the Treaty of Portsmouth with Japan, transferring Lushun, Dalian, and the southern section of the Chinese Eastern Railway (i.e., the section from Changchun to Dalian) to Japan.

Four Secret Agreements

From 1907 to 1917, Russia and Japan concluded four secret agreements in ten years, secretly dividing the Northeast into the spheres of influence of the two countries, that is, South Manchuria belonging to Japan and North Manchuria belonging to Russia. During these ten years, Japan first annexed Korea, then participated in the European War and achieved successive victories, while Russia faced the crisis of political revolution internally and suffered defeat against Germany externally. In 1917, the imperial system was overthrown and the Communist Party came to power. At that time, the civil war between the Red and White armies in Siberia broke out, so various countries sent troops to intervene, and Japan also participated.

On July 25, 1919, in order to request China's recognition, the Soviet government issued a declaration abandoning all its rights and interests in China, including its rights and interests in the Northeast and the Chinese Eastern Railway. On October 27, 1920, the Soviet government issued another statement, stating the conditions for establishing relations with China. Originating from these two documents, the Sino-Soviet Agreement of May 31, 1924, and the temporary management measures for the Chinese Eastern Railway were concluded. Unfortunately, the two countries failed to revise the detailed treaty originally planned, and in 1926, Ivanov interfered with military transport. In 1929, there was a Soviet Communist conspiracy in Harbin, which finally led to an armed conflict between the two countries on the eastern and western borders that year. On December 22, China and the Soviet Union signed the Boli Protocol, and both sides ceased armed actions. According to the protocol, the two countries should hold a meeting in Moscow to discuss the issue of redeeming the Chinese Eastern Railway. Unfortunately, this meeting, which started in May 1930 and ended in 1931 with the outbreak of the September 18th Incident, was delayed by the Soviet side and involved many complications, and ultimately yielded no results.

Conspiracy and Incident

The actions of Japanese imperialists in the Northeast since 1905 have claimed to be based on the Beijing Treaty of December 25 of that year and the so-called "protocol" (in fact, there is no such protocol). Since 1915, there has been the so-called exchange of notes of the Twenty-One Demands. Although this exchange of notes was signed by President Yuan Shikai under the pressure of Japanese military force, it was rejected and not ratified by the National Assembly. According to the constitution applicable in China at that time, any treaty not ratified by the National Assembly could not take effect. China raised this issue at the Paris Peace Conference and the Washington Conference. Although the powers at that time were afraid of Japan's violence and were unable to formally force Japan to withdraw, morally, all countries have long recognized that China is right and Japan is wrong. The September 18th Incident, launched by Japan on the pretext that the outstanding issues had not been resolved, has no basis other than violence.

At the beginning of the September 18th Incident, the slogan advocated by Japan was to resolve the outstanding issues between China and Japan. After its military actions succeeded, it revealed its true colors. It created the "incident" first, and then created the "puppet state." The "Manchukuo" was actually just a convenient term for Japan's rule and compromise after it occupied our Northeast by force.

On March 1, 1934, Puyi declared himself emperor. On March 23, 1935, the agreement for Japan to buy the Chinese Eastern Railway was signed. On July 15, the Japanese puppet regime signed an economic agreement in Changchun, establishing the Japan-Manchukuo Economic Joint Committee as the supreme advisory body for Japan's development of the Northeast's economy. On September 26, it suppressed British and American banks. On June 11, 1936, the Japanese puppet regime signed a new agreement, taking the gradual abolition of extraterritorial rights as a pretext for Japan to obtain all the same rights as the people of Manchuria and Mongolia in terms of residence, travel, employment, and land. By November 5, 1937, the Japanese puppet regime formally signed an agreement abolishing extraterritorial rights in Manchuria. On December 30, 1939, Japan and Wang Jingwei signed a secret agreement, stipulating that Wang Jingwei must recognize the puppet Manchukuo. On December 8, 1941, Japan declared war on Britain and the United States, and at the same time incited Wang Jingwei and the puppet Manchukuo to declare war on Britain and the United States.

Distressing Phenomena

It is natural that the compatriots who have suffered so many years of hardship are eager for our National Army to enter smoothly. But the most distressing thing is that the Communist Army's destructive and disruptive actions on the Shenyang railway line in the Northeast have not yet been effectively stopped. General Malinovsky of the Soviet Army also said that Dalian is not in his military district, expressing that he cannot assist in the takeover of Dalian. In addition, the National Army's airlift to the Northeast is already large in scale in itself, so this delayed advance cannot but "cause a feeling of impatience" (see our newspaper's Beiping dispatch on the 24th). In a helpless mood, we hope that all this can be completed in a lightning-like advance before New Year's Day, in the fastest possible way. (To be continued in Part 2 tomorrow.)

The Bustling Area of Shenyang City

Shenyang is the commercial center of the Northeast. Since its establishment, it has been more than 2,000 years old, and the population density is higher than in other areas of the Northeast. There is a medical university with quite complete equipment.

Crystallization of Ancient Traditional Art in the Northeast

The roofs, doors, or walls of folk dwellings, temples, and administrative agencies in the Northeast are often carved with traditional symbolic carvings, which are enough to glimpse the civilian life and religious emotions of our people. Pictured: Stone carvings on the wall of a lama temple, the technique is very exquisite.

### Berlin Shrouded in Grim Mist: Hunger, Despair, Disease, Death – Stranded Refugees Struggle in the Ruins

Wending your way through the ruined streets of Berlin, your eyes meet with nothing but rubble, refuse, and wreckage, until finally you reach the train station. Around you are the survivors of the war, German refugees who have tasted every bitterness. They emanate a fearful stench of hunger and disease. Their hollow eyes reflect their half-crazed state of mind. They are shrouded in a kind of deathly silence.

You begin to pick out an individual from this chaotic mass and speak with them. Their face immediately flashes with a look of anger and disappointment, and you know they have a painful story to tell. Others join in the conversation. As they talk, some shouting, some weeping, tired arms gesturing, the tragedy of the German refugees is reflected before our very eyes.

Although the Allied military government had issued orders prohibiting newcomers from entering Berlin, within just one month, 550,000 German refugees violated the order, causing considerable disturbance, and the

German Refugees Crossing the Border

are still increasing daily. About ten million German refugees, displaced during the war, are facing the same fate.

Released prisoners of war from Soviet concentration camps, Germans from the Sudetenland expelled by the Czechs, all German minorities driven out of Poland, residents of East Prussia and Silesia, and millions of men, women, and children east of the Oder-Neisse line, swept up by the torrent of war, are being driven towards Berlin under a terrible force.

Approximately 15,000 people arrive in Berlin daily, transported by three or four trains. The rooftops, between the carriages, even the footboards, are packed full. In theory, there is an organization specifically designated to handle these German refugees, to examine their health, provide them with food, and guide their actions. This is a German organization, because from the perspective of the United Nations, this is purely a German problem. But in reality... let's go to the train station to see what's actually happening.

At six o'clock in the afternoon, the train from the east is already delayed, and still has not arrived. A German station worker believes that it won't be too late today, because it's almost time for the last train of the day, and in fact there is only

One Train Making Round Trips

Finally, the train arrives.

The refugees slowly descend from the train, slower than you would expect. After hours of an agonizing journey, they now shuffle forward, their weary eyes filled with questions, their trembling (often bandaged) hands carrying their meager belongings. Bare feet, red, swollen, covered in blood and dirt, some wrapped in rags. Some wear their best "Sunday shoes," others have managed to grab a pair of sturdy hiking boots.

The air is filled with German: "Where

are we supposed to go

now?" "Can you tell me...?" "I'm starving!" Yes, they are hungry, and they also need water. One or two German Red Cross officials are surrounded. They want to help the refugees, answer their questions. But they are truly powerless. The refugees have not eaten for days, and there is still nothing here to give them, they are starving to death. Drinking water is also very scarce and dirty. There are also no cooking utensils.

Soon, this new group of refugees joins those who arrived yesterday and the day before, trudging on; passing through Berlin. Many remain at the train station, haggard, helpless, wandering, desperate.

"Where did you come from?" Oh, it's unbearable to hear. They have thousands of different experiences, but their tragic fate is the same. Luggage? A young girl shouts angrily: "Those damned Poles... they stole everything!" But, we should also remember how the German army ravaged this defeated country when Germany invaded Poland.

"Look at him—eighty years old, blind, with no relatives to rely on..." Their circumstances are worse than each other. They have lost everything, have nothing to eat, nothing to wear, they stink, their clothes are full of lice, and one girl was raped on the way. Because on this road there are gangs of Polish orphans, who lost their parents during the war, were not educated, and turned into

Criminal Thugs

They are armed with knives and pistols, specializing in robbing refugees, plundering their only possessions, such as watches, rings, wallets, etc. But they can't rob money, because the refugees have no money. Those adult thugs often take advantage of the danger to rape single women. You can easily recognize these women, they are unable to cry, simply mad.

Who will take care of these refugees? Strictly speaking, the social bureau of the Berlin city government originally had forty-eight temporary shelters, prepared to

accommodate 30,000

refugees every day. But some were closed because infectious diseases were discovered, some were requisitioned by the Allied forces, and the rest, although they exist, are unable to provide half a pound of bread and two bowls of watery soup to the refugees passing through, according to the planned schedule, due to food shortages. At the same time, because there are too few doctors, they cannot check their health. Most refugees suffer from dysentery.

How many refugee shelters are there really? Many people disappear on the road. Many people don't have the strength to go on. There are also many people who want to take the train back to their hometown to see if there is anything left to salvage, so they hide in the station. When you hear them complaining among them, they will suddenly interject: "See, over there, someone is about to die!" That's the ruins of platform number two, where a hundred trains used to arrive and depart every day before the war, never late. Now, a cattle car has been converted into a "corpse car." The car is filled with the dead and dying. The dead bodies are labeled with tags that read: "Body awaiting collection."

Leaving the station, the refugees first go to the Berlin City Hall to check their identity cards. Those without identity cards are reissued, and their intended destination is determined. There are only two hundred people working there, but they have to deal with 20,000 people, so of course they can't keep up. "This is your number, come back tomorrow." For many people, tomorrow never comes. Those who come back tomorrow, crane their necks, stretch their ears, waiting for their number to be called. When their turn comes, a fleeting moment of relief appears on their gloomy faces, and at the same time, their dull eyes

Flash a ray of hope

But doubts return. Is it a smart idea to follow the Allies' instructions? What is it like elsewhere? There are many rumors: "Did you see those corpses by the roadside? And those bodies hanging from the trees?" Death threatens not only Berlin, but lurks everywhere. Yet most people still place their hopes in the future. Can the future be even worse? Leaving here, going anywhere, can't be worse than here, right?

Anyone who wants to go to the British and American zones must first apply to the Allied military government in Berlin for approval. At the same time, those who have not been issued an exit permit by the Soviet army are not allowed to leave Berlin. Therefore, the streets of Berlin are filled with desperate refugees, holding various documents in their hands, crowding and struggling back and forth. A German officer, released from a Soviet prisoner-of-war camp,

Treks Thousands of Miles to Berlin

not knowing if his hometown was bombed, whether his wife and children are still alive. He inquires, hopes, and finally exhausts the last of his strength, collapsing on the road home. There are also emaciated mothers and babies on the road, as well as blind or disabled soldiers. They hope that the situation will be better elsewhere. But roses will not bloom in the post-war ruins.

Every day, tens of thousands of German refugees are transported from despair into Berlin's train stations, and tens of thousands of German refugees leave Berlin and are transported into new despair. Post-war Germany is filled with hunger, disease, despair, and death, and the fate of German refugees is the same everywhere. To this day, they have tasted the bitter fruits of Nazism, let them curse the crimes of the Nazi war demons for the rest of their lives!

### Secret Weapon of the English Channel: The Inside Story of Undersea Oil Pipelines – A Great Land-and-Sea Two-Story Invention

During the Allied landings in Normandy, France, the inexhaustible gasoline supply of the Anglo-American mechanized units that struck directly at the Nazi lair in Eastern Europe was truly a miracle! German reconnaissance planes tried their best to search for traces of Allied oil tankers in the skies above the English Channel, but the Allied armored forces continued to advance fiercely. Britain's astonishing secret of wartime gasoline transportation has now been revealed. The British call this secret thing "Pluto," and to put it more clearly, it is an undersea oil pipeline.

Undersea Oil Transportation Method – The Enemy Knew Nothing

The enemy knew nothing about this unprecedented method of oil transportation. From the summer to the winter of 1944, one million gallons of oil were transported from England to France every day via undersea pipelines. Subsequently, it was extended to Belgium, the Netherlands, and even deep into German territory, as far as the city of Frankfurt on the Main River.

Like the Mulberry harbors previously built off the coast of Normandy, "Pluto" is the crystallization of the combined invention of British scientific minds and British industry.

"Pluto" was also planned and completed in secret. Months before the collapse of the German forces under Commander-in-Chief Rundstedt, four oil pipelines had already crossed the English Channel, connecting the Isle of Wight with Cherbourg in France, while sixteen other oil pipelines ran from Dungeness across the 30-mile channel, connecting with Port-en-Bessin in France, directly reaching Antwerp and the Rhine area.

Regarding this "unique method," former British Prime Minister Churchill said: "This method of supplying gasoline on the enemy's coast is as convenient as using the Mulberry harbors as supply stations for general supplies." He also said: "The completion of the 'Pluto' oil transportation method is a great achievement of the British and a testament to the British's proud land-and-sea two-story engineering skills.

Minister of Gasoline Warfare – Raises the Question of Oil Pipelines

Marshal Rundstedt and other captured German generals all admitted that the German army's disastrous defeat was largely due to the overwhelming superiority of the Allied gasoline supply. It was generally acknowledged that a large amount of gasoline was needed across the English Channel, but gasoline and oil tankers were the best targets for enemy naval and air attacks.

In April 1942, the Minister of Gasoline Warfare, Loyd, working in secret, already had this idea. He asked Sir Louis whether there was a solution to the oil pipeline problem. The answer he received was: "Yes, can you lay a pipeline under the English Channel?" Loyd asked many experts, and they all said it was impossible. Undersea oil pipelines require high-pressure pumping stations, which are economically unfeasible to budget for. Oil tankers are much cheaper, and laying pipelines under the turbulent English Channel is an astonishing engineering feat due to the constantly changing weather and the rapid tides. The element of risk is extremely high.

Engineer Hartley – Turns "Impossible" into "Possible"

Even so, this is war, and everything requires extraordinary measures. Soon after, an expert came up with a practical plan. This person's name was Hartley, the chief engineer of the British (Iranian) Oil Company. His plan was to use undersea cable-laying ships to lay a pipe similar to an undersea telegraph cable under the channel, simply by making it hollow and removing the "insulation" or "isolation." Within 24 hours, hundreds of yards of this unique pipe were manufactured in the Siemens factory. In less than half a month, a post office cable-laying ship had begun its testing work near the Thames Estuary, near Chatham.

The great success of the "HAIS" (Hartley-Anglo-Iranian Oil Company Siemens) joint pipe production further inspired the British to expand their ambitions for testing. Another undersea cable company, called "Henleys," immediately joined the collaboration, capable of producing a 30-mile-long oil pipeline to be laid under the Bristol Channel between Swansea and Ilfracombe. The environment and situation there are similar to those of the English Channel.

In December 1942, a large ship capable of towing such a heavy and unusual oil pipeline was equipped as a general undersea cable-laying ship. Named HMS "Holdfast," after many difficulties, on the calm coast of "North Devon," at the Ilfracombe end, oil flowed continuously from the pipeline, proving that the plan was feasible.

This was a comprehensive experimental plan. The diameter of the pipe was expanded to two to three inches, the conveying capacity was strengthened to over 1,200 pounds per square inch, and the technicians of the British Royal Army Service Corps worked hard to research all the procedures and methods of high-pressure pumping and storage technology.

Hamil Pipeline – Also Declared Experiment Successful

In addition, another type of oil pipeline was also tested. This pipeline was designed jointly by Ellis, the chief engineer of the Burma Oil Company, and Hamil, the chief engineer of the Iraq Petroleum Company, and was named the "Hamil" type. At the National Physical Laboratory, with the assistance of various engineering companies, a 20-foot-long, three-inch pipe could be welded to any length, rolled onto a drum, and then straightened. The diameter of the drum should be at least 30 feet.

To test this method, the Admiralty first converted a small ship into the "Poseidon" type, with a giant wheel installed on the deck that could rotate on the drum ears. Then, a floating drum-shaped wheel was manufactured to carry enough pipe for the entire channel length. Stewarts & Lloyds engineering plant then followed this design, began construction, and established a factory specializing in welding 20-foot-long pipes to a length of 4,000 feet, loading 10 miles of pipe every day.

"Pluto" Force – Two Main Bases Established

Six giant drum wheels were manufactured, named "HMS Conundrum," or "Conun" for short, moored at the end of the pipeline, allowing lengths of 40 feet to be welded into continuous lines of 30 miles or more. When rolling, they could be rolled onto the "Conun" in an orderly manner. Each "Conun" weighed 1,600 tons, was 90 feet long, and 50 feet in diameter, and could carry 70 miles of oil pipeline. The barrels currently carrying oil pipelines are 40 feet in diameter.

The above two types of oil pipelines were successfully put into trial use in April 1943, and the Royal Navy began pipe-laying work, and the "Pluto" force was established at the same time. Its main base was in Southampton, and the second base was in Tilbury. One hundred officers and one thousand merchant ships participated in the work under the command of the Admiralty. Ships of all classes, from 10,000-ton ships to various small boats and motorboats, were available. "Conun" was used to handle Hamil-type oil pipelines, while HAIS-type oil pipelines were carried by four specially converted merchant ships, with Thames River boats assisting on the shore, because the water there was too shallow for large ships to operate.

Oil Delivered to the Front Line – Exceeds 120 Million Gallons

Even the "Conun" being towed by those two barges, meandering across the channel, was never attacked by the Germans. The German Air Force thought these were insignificant things. After Port-en-Bessin was recovered and the mines were cleared, almost 500 miles of oil pipeline connected Port-en-Bessin and Dungeness again. The Cherbourg pipeline became secondary. The Royal Engineers then installed a large set of continuous oil pipelines, passing through northern France, Belgium, all the way to Antwerp, so that gasoline could be transported directly from the oil tankers on the Liverpool docks, through the pipelines, to the Rhine area, until the Allies fired the last shot. The amount of oil delivered directly to the front-line units through this pipeline exceeded 120 million gallons.

"Pluto" Applied in All Allied Occupation Zones

These "Pluto" oil pipelines are still in full use today. About one million gallons of oil are still being delivered to the occupying forces and the people of the liberated areas every day. As for whether this will continue into the future, it doesn't matter, because this was originally an emergency work of British factories, and the efficiency and success both reached the highest level. At the same time, a large number of oil tankers were able to be withdrawn to deal with the anti-Japanese war in the Pacific. (Translated by Ming from this newspaper's translation department)

Northeast coal is the most abundant mineral in the entire territory, totaling 200 million metric tons. Second is iron. Other deposits such as gold, steel, iron, and placer gold are also extremely abundant, even sufficient for hundreds of years of use.

### Affiliation Issues of Trade Associations

— Luo Qinghua

Recently, the Shanghai National Medicine Commercial Trade Association completed its reorganization. It legally convened a membership representative assembly, revised its constitution, and re-elected directors and supervisors. It was discovered that among those elected, many had served as directors and supervisors of the association during the city's occupation. At that time, a representative from a certain agency, citing Article 15 of the Regulations for the Punishment of Traitors, which states, "Those who have held positions in puppet organizations and their affiliated agencies or groups, and have not been convicted under these regulations, shall still be ineligible to be candidates for public office or be appointed as civil servants for a certain period," argued that those who had been elected as directors and supervisors of the association during the occupation should not be eligible for election this time. As a result, the association's election could not be completed that day, and the directors and supervisors were not elected in accordance with the regulations, leading to the adjournment of the membership assembly. After this incident, more than 190 trade associations in Shanghai that were in the process of reorganization and restructuring, fearing similar situations, dared not schedule membership representative assemblies to carry out re-elections and complete the reorganization work, but instead watched and waited. Moreover, the current reorganization committee members of more than 190 trade associations were nominated by each trade association with double the required number, reported to the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce for review, and then submitted to the Social Affairs Bureau for selection of three to seven members to be appointed as reorganization committee members of each association. It is heard that some of them were elected as officials of their respective associations during the occupation. If they are all prohibited from holding public office, then the current appointment as reorganization committee members seems to be illegal. Consequently, their morale is low, and they are collectively considering resigning. Not only will the reorganization work be unable to move forward, but also the daily affairs of the associations will come to a standstill. The grassroots organizations of industry and commerce throughout the city will all enter a state of inactivity. Now that the restoration has just begun, everything is waiting to be rebuilt, and all require the use of the organizational strength of trade associations to promote efficiency. If the actions of trade associations are hindered in an invisible way, it cannot be said that this is not a serious problem at present. To investigate the root cause, it is necessary to first distinguish: Does the trade association have any affiliation system with any political organization?

It is found that in the past, puppet organizations, relying on the enemy's breath, spared no effort to destroy and reorganize our administrative system and social organizations. After the Pacific War, the enemy and puppet forces invaded the concessions. The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce was forcibly seized and personnel were sent to take over, and it was soon reorganized into the puppet Shanghai Chamber of Commerce. However, they did not carry out the same takeover of the various trade associations. This is because the puppet organizations also knew that trade associations were the grassroots organizations of each industry, with companies and firms in the industry joining as members. Store owners or managers were nominated as membership representatives. Those who served as directors and supervisors were always elected because they possessed economic conditions and service capabilities, and their credit and experience in the industry were widely respected. The nature of trade associations is different from that of general social organizations, which are based on individuals as members, and participation is entirely based on individual will. Their organization has a historical nature, is fixed and less prone to change. It cannot be destroyed by violence overnight, nor can it be arbitrarily transformed based on likes and dislikes. Therefore, puppet organizations did not dare to seize the various trade associations without authorization. Although the various associations held re-elections when their terms expired, it was merely a change of personnel within the industry. During the puppet organization era, there was never any appointment of directors and supervisors of the association by the puppet organization. This is because they knew that the situation did not allow it. Therefore, the situation of trade associations is completely different from the nature of commercial control committees, rice control committees, and cotton control committees under the administrative jurisdiction of the puppet organization. The former is a public interest group of the industry, with a long history, and its officials are elected by the industry to maintain and promote the public interests of the industry, and to correct malpractices. The latter is an economic group of the puppet organization, a temporary organization created by the evil forces of the enemy and puppets, and its officials are hired by the puppet organization to help the enemy and puppets collect materials and control distribution as their duties. During the occupation period, industry and commerce in the occupied areas suffered the destruction and persecution of the enemy and puppets, and traitors relying on evil forces also seized, exploited, and exhausted every means. Industry and commerce lost the protection of the motherland. Under the dark atmosphere, there was no way to appeal to heaven or enter the earth. The only thing they could rely on to preserve the remnants was the trade association of each industry, which was still a place for the industry to share weal and woe and encourage each other. However, those who served as directors and supervisors at that time, disregarding the ancient訓訓 of "wise men protecting themselves," endured humiliation and bore heavy burdens under the trampling of the enemy and puppets, sheltering the industry and sacrificing themselves for the public interest. Such dedication of loyal subjects and abandoned sons is truly commendable. Moreover, during this period, the various trade associations in Shanghai were able to not forget the motherland, cooperate with the underground work of the party and government, and not cooperate with the enemy and puppets in every possible way. There are historical facts to prove this. Regarding donations, comforting troops, public bonds, winter clothing donations, etc., all those launched and advocated by the Great Rear Area were enthusiastically responded to by the various trade associations in the city, regardless of difficulties and dangers, and they participated in almost every campaign. The last time was the solicitation of US dollar alliance victory bonds in the autumn of the 30th year. When the Central Solicitation Committee sent personnel to Shanghai, the cadres and comrades of the various trade associations in the city immediately launched a response. At that time, it was on the eve of the Pacific War, and the enemy and puppet forces had already invaded the concessions. The various trade associations still disregarded all dangers and remitted money to Chongqing under the aliases of Chunji and Huaji to subscribe to public bonds. Within a few months, the total amount of subscriptions exceeded that of any prosperous city in the Great Rear Area. At that time, the subscribers only obtained a bank remittance receipt and did not calculate anything else. To this day, all the aforementioned bonds are still kept in Chongqing, and are still summarized and kept by the custody committee. They have not been exchanged for the subscribers. This alone is enough to show that the people of various industries in Shanghai cherish the motherland and are enthusiastic. This is truly a national spirit and is extremely precious. In Shanghai, which had been occupied for a long time and was under severe coercion at that time, this contribution was particularly rare and commendable, and worthy of special mention.

History says, "When Emperor Gao of Han entered Guanzhong, he made a covenant of three chapters to renew the relationship with the people." Now that the mountains and rivers are rebuilt and the sky and the sun are shining again, the enemy and puppet's severe penalties and harsh laws were a hundred times more than those of Qin, and the people's enthusiasm for welcoming the return is far greater than in ancient times. Therefore, the first priority of the restored area at present is to stabilize people's hearts. To strictly distinguish between loyalty and treachery, and to declare the admonition of rewarding good and punishing evil. In the past, the industrial and commercial circles were inevitably home to some scoundrels who were blinded by greed, acted as accomplices of the enemy, and relied on the power of the enemy and puppets to infringe on the industry, search for materials, and commit many evils. Some have already been detained and are being tried. Some are still at large and waiting to be reported. We advocate punishing these pests and shameless scoundrels to the full extent of the law, without any leniency. However, the majority of good merchants must be appeased, pacified, and encouraged. Regarding the past directors and supervisors of the association, if their actions show that they did not rely on power to harm the motherland, they should be sympathized with for their encounters and not be overly demanding. If they endured humiliation, sheltered the industry, disregarded danger, and cared for the motherland, they should be commended for their hard work and dedication.

The "Regulations for the Punishment of Traitors" promulgated by the National Government this time has a total of sixteen articles, which are concise and comprehensive. After careful consideration of the meaning of the law, it is in line with the spirit of "annihilating the chief culprit and not discussing the coerced." The second article first states, "Those who collude with enemy countries and have one of the following acts are traitors." Then it lists fourteen crimes. The meaning of the text is clear and there is absolutely no confusion, so as to prevent the abuse of implication and involvement. The meaning of the law is very clear. The goodness of the legislative technique is rarely seen before. The original Article 15 of the regulations aims at those who serve as officials of puppet organizations, or those who hold positions in agencies and groups under their jurisdiction. Even if their actions do not meet any of the fourteen articles listed in the second article, and they cannot be convicted according to the regulations, but as citizens, they recognize thieves as fathers and accept puppet orders to serve in puppet positions, they should also be punished by reputation law. During a "certain period of time, they shall not be candidates for public office or be appointed as civil servants." At this point, only one question needs to be asked: Is the trade association "affiliated" with the puppet organization? Are the directors and supervisors of the association puppet officials appointed by the puppet organization? It is known that the trade association is a people's organization and does not belong to the puppet organization, nor does it belong to any government agency at any time. The directors and supervisors are elected by the members, not appointed by the puppet organization. The original regulations focus on the two words "affiliated," which refer to groups under the jurisdiction of puppet organizations such as commercial control committees, and do not involve trade associations. The meaning of the law is very clear.

Furthermore, trade associations are legal entities. According to civil law, they are non-profit social legal entities. The status of their directors and supervisors is the same as that of corporate directors and supervisors of for-profit enterprises, as mentioned in the same law. The government allows newly established companies in the restored area that were registered in puppet organizations during the war to supplement their registration, and has not interfered with the directors and supervisors. Then, should there be any difference in treatment for the association directors and supervisors of social legal entities? Referencing Article 2, Item 10 of the "Regulations on Handling Traitor Cases" promulgated on November 23: "Personnel of cultural, financial, industrial, free professional, autonomous or social groups within the jurisdiction of the enemy and puppets, who use the power of the enemy and puppets to infringe on others, and are reported or accused," is enough to prove that people's organizations in the occupied areas are all within the jurisdiction of the enemy and puppets, but have no affiliation. Whether they constitute a crime depends on whether their actions "rely on the power of the enemy and puppets to infringe on others, and are reported or accused."

Based on the above, it is known that merely serving as a director or supervisor of a trade association during the occupation period, and not participating in agencies or groups affiliated with the puppet organization, does not meet the provisions of Article 15 of the Regulations for the Punishment of Traitors. People in industry and commerce do not need to be alarmed or resentful. The competent authorities, who have the responsibility of guidance and supervision, will also be able to act according to the law and reason, and will not forcibly confuse matters, causing more disturbances.

The highest leader has earnestly explained the importance of economic construction, and hopes that the industrial and commercial circles will be the main body and exert their automatic power. President Song also emphasized that the industrial and commercial circles should not have a dependence mentality, and must use the power of unity to achieve high economic ideals. At present, the restoration and construction of the country and the economic revival are complex and multifaceted. All industries are expected to bear the responsibility of the times, have experience, and be able to play a leading role in various industries, and jointly shoulder the mission, cooperate with national policies, and seize this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. Implicating and litigating is forbidden since ancient times. Moreover, at a time when the country needs talents urgently, destroying talents without reason is a loss to the national strength. We must pay attention to this again and again.

### Gold Market Gradually Becomes Stagnant, Speculators Compete to Purchase US Dollars, Securities Firms Push Up Chinese Stocks

The range of gold prices has narrowed even further since yesterday. Speculations inside and outside the industry that the official exchange rate will be set before the Lunar New Year are becoming increasingly strong. General sentiment holds that once the exchange rate is fixed, gold will inevitably remain stagnant for a long period. As a result, attention has shifted to US dollars and Chinese and foreign stocks, causing the gold market to turn stagnant with few special changes. The market opened flat and weak in the morning, once falling slightly to around 805,000. Later, as the US dollar market rose again, a buying spree was triggered, pushing the price back to around 830,000. However, due to the approaching holiday, retail investors sold off at high prices, making it difficult to sustain. At noon, the price retreated to around 815,000. In the afternoon, the market struggled around 810,000, eventually closing down slightly by 5,000 compared to the previous day. Gold jewelry was priced at 87,000, and silver taels remained at 600 yuan. Silver dollars fell to below 440 due to slightly sluggish sales, with smaller coins even lower by 10 yuan. The dark exchange rate was stable, and supply and demand were also balanced. Generally, New Year's money market interest rates are around one corner (10%) for ordinary deals or at nine fen. External demanders pay higher interest rates, approximately one corner to one corner two fen (10-12%).

US dollars continue to be favored by many parties when prices drop. General sentiment holds that the official exchange rate will not be too far from reality, and that import merchants will not face unexpected risks in bringing goods in as local commodity prices have remained stable lately. Accordingly, they have been busy purchasing and storing US dollars in preparation for settling payments. The market was once vibrant, opening at 1,400 in the morning and then rising to 1,445 yuan. At noon, the price slightly retreated, hovering around 1,430 yuan. The afternoon was also quite calm. The market closed up slightly by 15 yuan compared to the previous day. Hong Kong dollars have become stable, with old notes and new notes both rising by 5 yuan and 4 yuan respectively.

Government bonds have gradually returned to calmness from their recent surge. Market professionals have decided to close shop from tomorrow until the fourth day of the Lunar New Year. The market is stagnant as it lacks activity. Prices have retreated slightly by 10 yuan to 35 yuan compared to the previous day.

Chinese stocks have become the target of speculators. As the gold market is trending towards stagnation and the US dollar market is gradually reaching saturation, major and retail investors have been actively involved in the stock market. Chinese stocks are the capital market for Chinese industry and commerce. Logically, there is no reason to permanently prohibit transactions. Today, the North China Daily News also called for the resumption of securities and stock exchanges as soon as possible. Expectations from all parties are even more urgent, and the prospects are broader and unrestricted. In addition, securities firms are taking advantage of the momentum to aggressively push up prices, hoping to create a peak closing. As a result, prices have risen even faster. Although there were some twists and turns along the way due to some selling off at high prices, the market still hovered at high prices at noon. Small-cap stocks, which were previously unpopular, are still gradually becoming active. The market closed up around 50 yuan compared to the previous day for popular large-cap stocks. The three small hot stocks rose by 5 yuan to 10 yuan.

Foreign stocks continued to be strong yesterday. Ewo Yarns, Ewo Brewery, and Paper Industries saw more active trading. Bidding prices were prevalent for all unpopular stocks. Rubber stocks, which had been dormant for a long time, are now of even less value, and demand from buyers is high, resulting in little to no supply. As a result, Ewo Yarns closed up 20 yuan compared to the previous day, Ewo Brewery up 10 yuan, and Paper Industries up 45 yuan. Unpopular stocks and rubber stocks all closed at bidding prices, with no one willing to sell.

### Yarn Prices Continue to Rise, with Sales in Both Local and Outlying Areas

Yesterday, the yarn market was as solid as a rock. Local weaving mills still have appetite for fine yarns, and prices have risen by another 20,000 to 30,000. 20-count yarns from retail distributors in Sichuan, Jiangxi, and other regions continue to see increases of 5,000 to 10,000 yuan. 16-count yarns saw mixed results, with Guangming rising by around 5,000. The trend of public sentiment towards stability is quite calm.

### Northern Routes Are Still Lively, Grain Prices Are Stable

The Chaozhou trading house continues to handle soybean cakes.

Both the Northern-style japonica and indica rice markets saw weak sales, while the Southern-style japonica rice market was brisk in both sales and purchases, as Qingdao and Tianjin both have appetite. Therefore, the early rice and thin rice are still active. Retail sales in this area are still sluggish. Prices are little changed from yesterday. White money and Yin money still have very few transactions. Soybean retail demand is still acceptable. The market is stable. Flour sales to outlying areas are weak, and local flour is coming to market, retreating 100 yuan. Miscellaneous brands are even less sought after. The oil market is slightly weak, down 300 to 500 yuan. Sesame and raw kernels are firmly established. The Chaozhou trading house continues to handle soybean cakes, and the market is becoming active again. Prices have risen by nearly 100 yuan. The wine market is selling very well, with little inventory. The market looks strong.

### Stove Users Compete to Purchase, Yangquan Filtered Coal Lumps Surge, Firewood Is Consistently Strong

Since stove coal users began competing to purchase white coal filtered lumps, Yangquan filtered lumps have fallen short of demand. Market prices are rising steadily and rapidly. The highest asking price has reached 400,000 yuan. The most recent transaction was at 380,000 yuan. The remaining prices are stable with little change. Daily arrivals of firewood have sharply decreased. Charcoal traders are taking advantage of the opportunity to generally hold back and wait for prices to rise. Market prices are consistently strong.

### Asphalt Turns from Weak to Buoyant

After being slightly weak at the beginning of the week, asphalt has recently turned buoyant again. Hangzhou news reports that premium goods have been sold for 15,000 yuan. He news reports that local cargo oil has been sold for 19,000 yuan. Local traders in this city sold local Kaihe for 21,000 yuan. Lanxi Baishen sold for 18,000 yuan, and Hanma Chengyou for 15,000 yuan.

### Australia Wheat Harvest Estimate

(Reuters, Sydney, 29th) The Australian wheat harvest is estimated to be 134,800,000 bushels, compared to only 57,000,000 bushels last year.

### Commercial Situation Summary

Sugar Market: Continuing the upward trend from the previous day, with merchants boosting prices, another increase was reported, and futures trading has opened.

Western Medicine: Supply and demand are balanced. According to news, Monsanto's saccharin factory has set a price of US$1.53, which translates to just over 2,000 yuan in legal tender.

Dried and Preserved Goods: Sales to outlying areas are strong. With gold prices reporting anomalies, market prices have risen accordingly.

Raw Silk: Market prices are stable, and trading is flat. Jili's market is robust due to strong demand from factories, with prices reaching 600,000 yuan.

Tea: High-grade baked green and stir-fried green teas are being absorbed by Tianjin merchants, with selling prices rising by 2,000 to 3,000 yuan compared to the previous day. Coarse green tea has not been able to recover due to oversupply. News indicates that Guangzhou merchants are planning to handle red and green tea leaves.

Knitted Goods: The market opened weak but, as gold prices were slightly lower than the previous day, undershirts and socks also retreated slightly compared to the previous day.

Cigarettes: Yesterday, due to the weekend, buyers were waiting and watching, and sellers were selling off, resulting in a gradual decline in market prices.

Silk: Prices have been rising for days, but the market softened yesterday. However, buyers are mostly staying out due to high prices, and trading is scarce.

### Reefs in the Export Industry of the Southern Islands: Vast Price Differences

After the victory, domestic import and export traders have been hoping to develop trade with the Southern Islands. According to industry insiders, trade with the Southern Islands may be difficult to restore in the short term. The main reason is that, in the past eight years, commodity prices in China have risen by an average of 1,500 to 2,000 times, while commodity prices in the Southern Islands have risen by an average of only 500 to 100 times. Therefore, even if the new exchange rate is increased to 1,500 yuan, exporters will still be unable to make progress.

### Economic Briefs

New prices for hotel rooms in this city have been agreed upon by relevant agencies and are said to be implemented from the first of the new year.

A large batch of medicinal materials from Hankou has arrived in Shanghai, including more than 380 pieces of honeysuckle, 72 pieces of rawhide, 100 pieces of pig bristles and pig hair, and 16 boxes of tea, all loaded on the Jiang'an Wheel. The Zhoushan Wheel also transported 36 packages of Yuyao flowers from Yong.

The Shanghai Commodity Tax Bureau recently announced that, as the end of the year is approaching, all merchants of yarn, cloth, sugar, Western beer, and local wine in the city who have failed to sell all of their goods within the deadline should pay supplementary taxes in accordance with regulations. Therefore, it is stipulated that each merchant must report the types, quantities, and storage locations of the above-mentioned inventory as of tomorrow to the bureau before January 10. Overdue reports will be treated as tax evasion.

The Jianghai Customs recently issued a notice stating: For local goods transported from one domestic port to another through a foreign port, regardless of the nationality of the carrying vessel, the export tax shall be collected by the customs at the port of origin, and the import tax shall be collected by the port of arrival.

Small silk factories and flour mills in Wuxi are currently preparing to resume operations. Silk factories are concerned that the output of Jiangnan raw silk is small and the selling price is too high, so there may not be significant development in the short term. Flour mills, however, will be able to resume operations more easily because the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration has transported a large amount of wheat flour.

### Financial News

According to Chongqing news, the National Bank is advocating for lower interest rates. The Central Bank's state-owned industrial loans have already been reduced to 2%. Recently, it is also planning to begin refinancing and rediscounting with a quota of 100 billion, and the interest rate may be suppressed to one-half of the original interest rate. (China, Transportation, Communication, and Agricultural Bank currently use 3.6% for loans. The Central Bank charges 2.7% for refinancing. Therefore, general banks are unwilling to refinance).

The Chongqing City Bank is scheduled to open on January 5, 35th year. Mayor Zhang will concurrently serve as chairman of the board, and Mr. Zhang Jiandong has been appointed as general manager. In order to restore all exchange transactions, exchange shops in Hong Kong must still pay attention to the provisions of Article 5 of the Defense Finance Regulations of 1940. All foreign currency income must be sold to HSBC, which is responsible for exchange control. However, the designated foreign currencies are not as extensive as in 1940. The specified types are as follows: (1) US dollars, (2) Canadian dollars, (3) Philippine pesos. It is also illegal to transport the above-mentioned currencies.

### Ministry of Finance Issues Order to Investigate Whether Restored Area Commercial Banks Have Colluded with the Enemy

According to Chongqing news, commercial banks in the restored area are now resuming operations one after another. In order to thoroughly rectify finance, the financial authorities have ordered each special commissioner's office to conduct a strict investigation of the commercial banks and businesses that have been provisionally approved to resume operations in each district, and have given the following two instructions: (1) Whether there have been any changes in the shareholding, licenses, and business guidelines of each commercial bank and business during the occupation period. (2) Whether each commercial bank has colluded with the enemy during the occupation period.

### One Aspect of Dealing with Old Cotton Yarn Godown Vouchers

To the Editor:

Having read a news item entitled "Cotton Yarn Merchants Pursue Old Godown Vouchers" in the Commercial News section of your esteemed newspaper on the 27th of this month, I find that many of the details mentioned therein do not accord with the facts as experienced by our factory. After investigation, the amount of cotton yarn stored in the godown by our factory on December 8th of the 30th year exceeded the amount deposited by the holders of the godown vouchers. The excess portion belonged to our factory, and thus was not fictitious. This is the first point to clarify. Furthermore, after December 8th, our factory was managed by the enemy Japanese army, and the stored cotton yarn, including that deposited by the godown voucher holders and that belonging to our factory, was forcibly "requisitioned" by them. We have "requisition orders" to prove this, which is entirely different from the purchase of cotton yarn. This is the second point to clarify. Subsequently, after strenuous negotiations, we managed to recover a portion of it. Following fair principles, we prepared an allocation list, which was published in the newspaper. Most of the godown voucher holders considered it appropriate and came to claim their share according to the allocation ratio. Therefore, our factory not only addressed the godown voucher issue early on but has also largely resolved it. This is the third point to clarify. Currently, with the victory of the War of Resistance, our factory has applied to the authorities for compensation for the losses suffered during the war. The losses suffered by the godown voucher holders are also included in our request for compensation. This proves that our factory has done everything possible to safeguard the interests of the godown voucher holders and has fulfilled its responsibilities as a trustee. This is the fourth point to clarify. To prevent misunderstandings arising from a lack of understanding of the true situation, we are clarifying the circumstances of our factory and hope you will publish this in the Commercial News section of your esteemed newspaper to dispel doubts and accord with the facts. Sincerely, Tung Yih Textile Co., Ltd., December 29th, Year 34.

Now that the light has come, the third and fourth-year students of the university have returned to Shanghai to resume classes. In order to commemorate the joy of re-establishment, the alumni in Shanghai and the students at the university have decided to hold a football match between the alumni team and the student team on New Year's Day of the 35th year, after the meeting of the alumni association, to celebrate and to allow famous football players to relive old times. It will be a lively event for the football community.

[Reuter, London, 28th, Associated Press]

News Evening Post reports: Xu Chengji, the Chinese player in the Davis Cup, retains the British Hard Court Tennis Championship. He was reported missing during the war, but is now safe and sound. He will try to retain the 1946 championship. Mr. Xu resided in Batavia for many years during the war and still practiced tennis regularly. If he can be paired with Cai Huiquan, his opponent in the 1939 Hard Court Tennis final, he can become a promising Chinese player in the Davis Cup.

In addition to inviting people from the sports world to participate, the Shanghai Sports Association will be invited to send representatives to attend and provide guidance.

Letters from Readers

### The Appeals of Out-of-School Youth - Please Consider This by the Organizers of the Provisional National University Preparatory Class

Dear Editor: We humbly borrow a corner of your valuable newspaper with twelve points of sincerity to publish what we out-of-school youth want to say. I wonder if you will allow it? "Faithfulness" is an inherent Chinese virtue and a creed that everyone should adhere to. Who would have known that a solemn and grand university would go against its word! Mr. Editor! Isn't this strange news? Yesterday, in the "Education and Sports" section of your newspaper, I saw that the Provisional National University Preparatory Class held an entrance exam. The reason given was that "there were too many applicants, the school buildings were insufficient, and the documents of the students could not be verified immediately because the original schools no longer existed. An entrance exam was necessary for selection." However, looking back at the admissions brochure of the Provisional National University Preparatory Class, there was no mention that an additional exam was required due to too many applicants, or that an additional exam was required for unqualified documents. On the contrary, we saw how sympathetic they were to out-of-school youth and how concerned they were about out-of-school youth in their admissions brochure. Under the item of "Treatment," it stated that tuition was waived, and room and board were at one's own expense (students whose economic sources were cut off would be subsidized by the class upon verification). We were so moved by this preferential treatment that we were almost in tears. Because of this, we came from thousands of miles away with great hope and at great risk. We were determined to seek considerable knowledge to repay the country in the future, so as not to fail this preferential treatment, and we applied to the Provisional National University, waited for notification, prepared to attend classes, and reported to our families how wonderful the school was. Everything was like a flash in the pan, and the good dream was short-lived. How can we not blame the other petty thieves if the people who run education can be so fickle! We are not afraid of the exam, nor are we complaining. However, the spirit of our youth is fragile, and we cannot withstand repeated setbacks. Everyone knows the suffering we have endured in the past eight years. Enemy bandits, puppet soldiers, and bandits have emerged in endless varieties. Especially now, we are people who cannot return home! Who says it is victory? What does victory bring us? We only feel emptiness and hopelessness, we only feel sadness and decadence! Originally, it was appropriate for schools to have exams, and we cannot deny that. However, one or two thousand students were complaining that the school buildings were not enough and that an exam had to be added. What will happen to the students who fail the exam? Should they be blamed for their poor knowledge? Should they be blamed for not attending a puppet school or going to the Great Rear Area? Attending a puppet school is probably related to ideology, and going to the Great Rear Area is not economically feasible. Fortunately, the first item in the purpose section of the admissions brochure of the Provisional National University Preparatory Class clearly states that it is to provide remedial education for high school graduates who are out of school in order to prepare them for university. The qualifications are for graduates of public or private high schools, and the registration procedures are to submit a graduation certificate, a photo, and a guarantee. It is precisely because of poor knowledge that they come for remedial education. If they were good, why not apply directly to the university and go through the trouble of doing so? If it is said that the school buildings are not enough, why didn't they state it when the school was established that the school buildings were limited and that students from afar who were not sure of passing the exam should not come, causing students from afar to travel back and forth? Even more strangely, under the circumstance that the school buildings are not enough, only the room and board of the "students who are not pseudo" who do not need to take the exam can be provided for studying. On the contrary, the school buildings are not enough and an exam must be taken. I do not believe that the education of truth and falsehood is originally so one-sided. Mr. Editor! I have said so much above, and I am afraid that I have offended many great gentlemen, but if he is a great gentleman, he will surely be able to forgive my suffering, because we are from northern Jiangsu, we escaped from the bandit dens, we stole across the blocked port when there were ten thousand dangers, and now we look north to our homeland. Can't even the slightest cry of tears from us get their agreement? Therefore, I hope that the educational authorities will let us start classes soon, so that we can find a place to rely on in spirit and academics, and not let precious time be wasted day by day. We want to believe that the youth in the occupied areas who are in hardship and difficulty will never fail the country! Mr. Editor: This is a little cry from us out-of-school youth. Can it be published so that righteous people in society can make a more powerful appeal to the educational authorities on our behalf? We are extremely looking forward to it!

Sincerely wishing you peace! Sincerely, Zheng Xudong, Li Zhen, etc. of the out-of-school youth

(3) Regarding the Central Trust Bureau's method of selling enemy and puppet furniture, the regulations stipulate that the Real Estate Department of the Central Trust Bureau should classify enemy and puppet furniture according to its nature, materials, style, type, condition (new or used), number, and registration, and after valuation, report it to the Handling Bureau for approval of the minimum price standard for separate sales. All furniture left in enemy and puppet properties, or attached to buildings as decorations, or inconvenient to move, should be sold to the tenant of the house as a principle. Other furniture that has been received and moved to warehouses, crude, old furniture, or sundries that have no value to move, will be sold directly to public institutions and public utilities, priced on consignment, entrusted to auction, or sold on-site. For detailed procedures, please contact the Central Trust Bureau for information.

Procedures for Secret Reports and Rewards

(4) Procedures for secret reports and rewards: (1) For all secret report cases, the secret reporter should be notified within half a month after the materials are discovered and confiscated, and proceed directly to the Investigation Team to apply for rewards. Cases that have been concluded in the past should be cleared immediately and the secret reporter notified to apply for rewards. A blank reward application form should be attached to this notice, to be filled out by the original secret reporter and sent directly to the Investigation Team. (2) The valuation of seized assets will be handled by the Accounting Advisory Committee. The Investigation Team should provide a list of the assets seized in each concluded case to the Accounting Advisory Committee at any time. The Accounting Advisory Committee should, upon receiving this notice, assess the price in turn and notify the Liquidation Office and the Investigation Team separately. If the seized assets are complex in variety, with different brands and forms, or are old and incomplete items such as factories, mines, farms, or houses, and the list cannot be easily itemized one by one, and the price cannot be determined, the Accounting Advisory Committee may estimate the total value or estimate the minimum price as the standard for calculating the bonus and disposing of the price. (3) According to Articles 5 and 7 of the Supplementary Measures for Encouraging Secret Reports, the Investigation Team may, after reviewing the reward application, issue part of the reward in kind or in cash, taking the circumstances of the case into consideration. (4) After the Investigation Team approves and registers the application according to the above, it will notify the secret reporter to come to the team to collect the reward certificate and go directly to the Liquidation Office to receive the reward. At the same time, the approved reward application and calculation sheet, etc., will be transferred to the Liquidation Office for issuing the reward. (5) According to Articles 1 and 2 of the Supplementary Measures for Encouraging Secret Reports, if the secret report of assets is verified and handed over to the receiving agency, or before the valuation and disposal, a part of the reward is issued first, the secret reporter should be given a reward certificate. This reward certificate will be issued by the Investigation Team. If it is handed over to the receiving agency, the Investigation Team will notify the Liquidation Office at the time of handover. If a part of the reward is issued first, the reward certificate will be given at the same time as the reward is issued.

### Zhou Yi, a Traitor, to be Tried by the High Court Tomorrow

Zhou Yi, a Cantonese, held an important position in the Shanghai Petroleum United Branch of a Japanese company on North Sichuan Road during the enemy and puppet era. After being detained and interrogated, he was transferred to the High Procuratorate, which, after investigation, found him guilty and filed a public prosecution with the High Court based on Article 2 of the Regulations for Punishing Traitors. It is learned that the High Court has scheduled the case for formal trial on the morning of the 31st.

### Legal Tender and Gold Bars Prohibited from Being Carried to Taiwan

Regarding the prohibition of passengers traveling to Taiwan from carrying legal tender and gold bars, according to the Shanghai Liaison Office of the Taiwan Provincial Administrative Office, legal tender is not commonly used in Taiwan and may disrupt the market. It is understood that the exchange rate for the Taiwan dollar currently in use there is approximately 20 to 30 yuan in Keelung. The office established by the Central Bank is actively planning the exchange of currency systems to gradually unify them with the mainland. Four or five days ago, the price of gold in Taiwan was about 3,400 Taiwan dollars per tael. In order to prevent unscrupulous merchants from taking advantage of the situation, it is also forbidden to carry gold bars.

### General Wedemeyer Claims No U.S. Troops in Northeast; Answers Various Questions at Press Conference Yesterday

[Reported by this newspaper] General Wedemeyer, Commander of the U.S. Forces in the China Theater, hosted a press conference for Chinese and foreign reporters at his office on the eighth floor of the Jiangxi Road Construction Building at 11:00 AM yesterday, answering various questions as follows: Regarding assisting China in transporting troops to the Northeast, it is currently underway. General Du Yuming's troops have been transported from Haiphong to Huludao, but have not yet reached the Northeast. Currently, there are 4,800 personnel and 400 vehicles, and a large number of troops are planned to be transported there. However, with the cold winter, the troops' cold-weather equipment is the biggest problem, and it will take considerable time to fully equip them. As for the allocation of materials, except for a portion borrowed from the U.S. and a portion of Japanese war spoils, all are provided by the Chinese government, that is, those obtained by the U.S. are also purchased by the Chinese government. General Wedemeyer specifically stated that there are no U.S. Marines in the Northeast.

Assistance in Building the Army Does Not Involve Other Matters

Regarding the U.S. military advisory group in China, General Wedemeyer stated that it has not yet been formally organized, and there is no definite news from Washington. However, if it is established, its mission will be entirely to assist China in building its army, navy, and air force, and it will not involve the Chinese government's economic, political, and other issues. Its general headquarters will be located where the Chinese government is located, possibly in Nanjing. The U.S. military headquarters will be located in Shanghai. General Wedemeyer does not know how long he himself will stay in China. He may be responsible for the initial work of the advisory group, but not necessarily as its permanent head.

Strictly Crack Down on Anti-Soviet Actions

A reporter asked about recent reports that some U.S. Navy personnel have been taking anti-Soviet actions. General Wedemeyer stated that he had heard of this matter when he was in Nanjing and is currently investigating it in detail. If such actions occur, he will severely punish them. He himself is engaged in military affairs and tries his best to avoid being partisan. Although he does not know the personal thoughts of every subordinate, he firmly believes that their actions have no political effect.

U.S. Military Work Not Difficult to Solve

Asked when U.S. military personnel who are idle and have no work will begin working, General Wedemeyer said that there are currently three problems that need to be resolved before there can be a lot of work: the U.S. military advisory group has not yet been formally established; if it is established, a part of the U.S. military must be left in China to work. There is a lot of work to be done when the enemy is withdrawn. When the Chinese government sends troops to the Northeast, if it starts immediately, it will also require the assistance of U.S. military personnel. The length of time the U.S. military stays in China also depends on the length of the withdrawal work. As for whether air force personnel have the opportunity to fly, General Stratemeyer, commander of the U.S. Air Force, replied that all current air force officers and soldiers have the opportunity to fly, and he is not aware of anyone who does not have the opportunity to fly. If such a situation exists, he would like to know.

Military Dependents Can Come Next Spring

A reporter asked when U.S. military personnel could bring their families to China. General Wedemeyer said that his subordinates have repeatedly raised this issue, but he has not yet received instructions from the U.S. military. If he were responsible for this matter, he would like to follow this rule: if ten officers can bring their dependents to China, then one hundred soldiers' dependents should come together. However, there is currently a lack of facilities and schools for children to study. He hopes that U.S. military families will be able to come here next spring. All travel expenses will be provided by the government.

Strict Punishment for Violations

Regarding incidents of U.S. military causing trouble, the U.S. military headquarters has repeatedly issued warnings and punishments, and will continue to enforce its rules, but in fact it is difficult to control. Regarding the waste and sale of military supplies by the U.S. military, the U.S. authorities have taken various measures to stop it, but hope that the Chinese people will also cooperate and not casually buy and sell military supplies. General Wedemeyer said that he has indeed taken various measures to persuade them to save, but he is reluctant to interfere with their personal freedom. At the same time, there is a lack of specialized personnel here to do surveillance work. He is now planning to hold court every evening to try personnel who violate the rules, and strict punishments will be imposed regardless of rank.

Regarding the withdrawal of enemy troops, it is estimated that 12,000 to 15,000 U.S. troops are required. There are currently about 8,000 to 10,000 U.S. troops in China, so some personnel will come to China from the U.S. Regarding the repatriation of enemy forces from Germany, Austria, etc., it has nothing to do with the U.S. military. Furthermore, matters concerning British, Soviet, and French affairs in China are all handled by themselves in consultation with the Chinese authorities.

Marshall's Visit to Beiping May Include Shanghai

General Wedemeyer also said that Marshal Marshall may pass through Shanghai when he goes to Beiping because there are still issues that need to be examined and studied. Wedemeyer believes that Marshall is a good soldier and statesman, and this visit to China has great significance in diplomacy and politics.

### All Wireless Radios Must Be Registered According to Law

The person in charge of the Telecommunications Supervision Section of the Inspection Office of the Songhu Preparatory Headquarters stated: The purpose of control is primarily to prevent criminals from using wireless radio to transmit information, endanger national interests, and disrupt social stability. As the Shanghai area is vast and there are a large number of machines, it is impossible to inspect and supervise without starting with registration. All radio enthusiasts, radios, and manufacturers and merchants selling wireless radios within this garrison area must register according to law for management purposes. The various procedures handled by the section are handled in accordance with legal procedures, and efforts will be made to be simple and convenient for the parties concerned. Those who have not completed the registration procedures must go to the section of the Inspection Office on the sixth floor of the Preparatory Headquarters Building at the North Sichuan Road Bridge as soon as possible to complete the procedures.

### Municipal Chamber of Commerce and Other Groups Telegraph Respect to Marshall

The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, the Shanghai Local Association, the Shanghai General Labor Union, and other groups telegraphed the U.S. Embassy in Chongqing and Special Envoy Marshall yesterday, expressing their gratitude for the noble spirit of the U.S. in sending naval, land, and air forces to China for assistance.

### U.S. Military Assigns Captains to Repatriate Japanese Prisoners

[Reported by this newspaper] In order to accelerate the repatriation of Japanese prisoners and residents, the U.S. military authorities have transferred six landing ships to Shanghai in advance to repatriate the fourth batch of Japanese prisoners. Each ship carries 1,000 people. The ships entered the port yesterday afternoon and are now berthed at the Qiujiang Wharf. It is scheduled to board the ship today. In total, four batches of repatriated Japanese prisoners and residents will total 17,550 people.

### Municipal Bureau of Public Works Trials Mechanical Road Construction in Jiangwan

The Municipal Bureau of Public Works recently tried to use machinery to build an elliptical roundabout at the intersection of Songhu Road, Huangxing Road, Qimei Road, Dongxiangyin Road, and Xixiangyin Road, known as Wujiaochang, in Jiangwan. The project has been underway for several days. In order to allow the press in the city to understand the engineering situation of the mechanical road construction, Zhao Zukang, Director of the Bureau of Public Works, hosted reporters from various newspapers to visit yesterday afternoon. Director Zhao first reported that the significance of this trial of mechanical road construction is twofold: (1) It shows that the municipal government still pays great attention to municipal construction in the city center. (2) Increase the rate of road construction and improve construction efficiency. Chen Fuhua, of the Fifth District Engineering Management Office of the Municipal Bureau of Public Works, then gave a brief report on the technical aspects of mechanical road construction.

It has convened several symposiums with all companies in the city and decided that from January 1, 1946, all fire insurance policies issued by various companies must collect the full amount of the premium stated on the insurance policy from the policyholder within ten days from the date of issuance and shall not give any discounts or extend the payment period.

### Failure to Affix Stamp Tax; Penalties Will Be Imposed According to Law After the Deadline

The Shanghai Direct Taxation Bureau stated that since the stamp tax was levied in the city, most businesses have not affixed stamps in a timely manner, and all invoices and receipts that have not been stamped cannot be recovered for supplementary stamping. Please make a flexible arrangement, willing to pay all the stamp tax owed during the period according to the turnover in one lump sum. The bureau has approved it and formulated an application form for supplementary payment of stamp tax, which will be issued by various businesses for self-declaration. After verifying the amount of tax to be supplemented, a stamp tax payment voucher will be issued. However, from January 21, 1946, if illegal vouchers are found again or reported, they will be immediately transferred to the court for handling and cannot be settled by supplementary payment.

### Mayor Qian Commends Police Officers for Their Efforts in Solving Cases

### Mayor Qian's Report Yesterday: Right-Hand Traffic to Begin on New Year's Day; Estimated One Million Passengers

(Our Newspaper's Report) Mayor Qian announced that the national policy of right-hand traffic will be implemented on New Year's Day next year. The city of Shanghai has frequent traffic and the number of vehicles and passengers is the highest in the country. Therefore, right-hand traffic requires broader publicity to facilitate its implementation. Yesterday, he specially hosted the city's press at the City Hall auditorium. Attendees included Mayor Qian, Deputy Mayor He DeKui, Secretary-General Shen Shihua, Director of Public Utilities Bureau Zhao Zengyu, Director of Police Bureau Xuan Tiewu, Director of Public Works Bureau Zhao Zukang, Deputy Commander Li, and fifty to sixty reporters from various Chinese and foreign newspapers.

Sounding Sirens, Correcting Time

Mayor Qian began by stating that in most countries around the world, vehicles drive on the right. China has historically driven on the left. Therefore, vehicles purchased from abroad often require modification of the steering wheel, which costs 12% of the vehicle's price. The total cost of modifications nationwide is substantial. Thus, saving modification costs is another reason for switching to right-hand traffic. Furthermore, during the War of Resistance, various places had air defense command centers, air defense intelligence networks, and alarms. After the war, these facilities lost their purpose. It is now proposed to use them as tools to alert citizens. The city has decided to sound sirens at exactly 12:00 noon every day, starting on New Year's Day next year, to facilitate citizens' synchronization to the standard time. As for the implementation time for right-hand traffic in the city, it was originally scheduled for 12:00 midnight on December 31st of this year. However, as that evening coincides with New Year's Eve, amidst the celebrations, it is inconvenient to make a sudden change. Therefore, it has been decided to implement it starting at 6:00 AM on New Year's Day. At 6:00 AM that day, the city will sound sirens, and all vehicles will switch to right-hand traffic.

Vehicle Congestion, Safety First

Director of Public Utilities Bureau Zhao Zengyu then reported, summarizing three points: First, a report on the city's traffic facilities, including the modification of traffic lights, platforms, and stations, and the number of modifications. Second, a report on the total number of vehicles of various types in the city and the number of passengers. According to the report, the total number of registered motorized vehicles, pedicabs, rickshaws, bicycles, etc., reaches 127,898, and the number of passengers reaches over one million. Third, given the large number of vehicles and people, the primary concern should be safety. For example, the speed limit in the city is 20 miles per hour, and outside the city, it is 30 miles per hour. Other important points include attention to traffic lights and newly painted yellow lines for sidewalks.

Most Accidents Occurred Last Month

Finally, Director of Police Bureau Xuan Tiewu reported that the city is transitioning from an old-fashioned city to a modern metropolis, resulting in a mix of old and new transportation methods. The types are complex, and the quantities are large. Furthermore, many streets do not meet standards. Even Nanjing Road is considered too narrow. Therefore, the only remedy is to widen the roads and even consider building underground trams. Director Xuan then reported on the number of traffic accidents and casualties in recent months. From September 12th, when Director Xuan took office, to the end of that month, there were 138 traffic accidents, with 90 injuries and 4 deaths. In October, there were 294 traffic accidents, with 163 injuries and 7 deaths. In November, there were 322 traffic accidents, with 219 injuries and 18 deaths. In December, there were 234 traffic accidents, with 126 injuries and 9 deaths. In total, there were 988 traffic accidents in over three months, with 598 injuries and 38 deaths. Director Xuan further stated that the eight years of war have severely damaged the city's original good traffic management, which now requires active reorganization and restoration. There were 74 traffic violations from September 12th to the end of that month, 185 in October, 174 in November, and 137 in December, totaling 570. It is reported that most traffic accidents occur on the bridges over the Suzhou Creek.

Uniform Display of National Flags Required

Furthermore, since the implementation of traffic management on Nanjing Road, the number of accidents has decreased by about 40%. It is predicted that after the switch to right-hand traffic, the number of accidents may increase due to habit. However, he will mobilize all officers to assist in directing and explaining. Director Xuan also addressed the matter of the Police Bureau producing national flags and flagpoles on behalf of citizens. He stated that this action is purely to facilitate citizens and comply with the Executive Yuan's instructions. In the future, flag displays must strictly adhere to the previously issued regulations on displaying the party and national flags. Therefore, the size, hanging method, and position of the flags must be uniform to enhance the spectacle. To facilitate citizens, the Bureau has convened meetings with blacksmith shops and flag manufacturers to handle this matter at the lowest possible price.

### Land Bureau Handles Land Registration; Real Estate Developers Express Opinions; Authorities Hope Owners Understand the Significance of Legislation

(Our Newspaper's Report) Due to the concessions and the eight years of occupation, the ownership of land in Shanghai is confused and unclear. The Land Bureau, following the central government's intentions, is determined to rectify the situation and complete the city-wide measurement on schedule. The period for registration and submission of documents is from November 19th of this year to January 18th, 1946, with a registration fee of 0.4% levied. The deed tax is levied according to the central government's regulations, with a valuation-based collection of 6% to 15%. Mayor Qian issued a written statement on the 23rd of this month, demonstrating the importance the authorities attach to this matter. Since the start of the process, it has been over a month, but only a few have registered. The City Chamber of Commerce and major real estate developers, bank trust departments, etc., recently held a meeting to discuss this matter. Yesterday, the reporter interviewed real estate developers to solicit their opinions, which can be summarized in several points:

Two-Month Deadline is Too Short

(1) The total amount of land in Shanghai is approximately 210,000 mu, and the total number of households is approximately 300,000. The current Land Bureau has only three registration offices, each processing 200 applications per day, for a maximum of 600 applications per day. It would take one and a half years to complete the process. Setting a two-month deadline is unrealistic. (2) According to land tax regulations, the registration fee is only 0.2%, but the Land Bureau now stipulates 0.4%. The City Chamber of Commerce has submitted a request to the municipal government to forward it to the central government for a reduction. There is also no provision for a 15% deed tax in the Land Law, so a request for exemption is also being made. (3) The valuation method is based on the valuation of the puppet government in 1941, cumulatively increasing each year, reaching 200 times this year. Most real estate developers believe that the Land Bureau's experts should jointly discuss with representatives of the city's real estate developers to determine the valuation method and make it public. The valuation of the puppet government is difficult to use as a standard.

Stalled Transactions Affect Finance

(4) Real estate is Shanghai's largest asset. Financial circulation requires real estate title deeds as collateral. Registration requires a two-month public notice period, which will severely impact the city's finances. Shanghai real estate has always been commercialized, and property transfers are frequent. The imposition of a deed tax will halt transactions, causing land prices to plummet, potentially triggering a financial crisis. All the capital of real estate companies has been used to purchase real estate, and most will not be able to pay such large registration fees and deed taxes. Shanghai's land administration has always been chaotic, with various types of deeds, such as *fang dan* (field deeds), *jiao dan* (corner deeds), *dao qi* (lease deeds), and land occupation certificates. In the past, there was no comprehensive measurement. *Dao qi* were perpetual lease deeds used by foreigners, exempt from land tax, with maps and quick transfer and mortgage processes. Therefore, many Chinese put their property under the name of foreign firms to obtain *dao qi*. During the occupation, the government moved, and land was divided, with no place to handle it. Therefore, banks and trust departments implemented a trusteeship system. The Land Bureau is determined to thoroughly eliminate these two unreasonable systems, which the city's real estate developers strongly support.

Land Authorities Explain the Significance

However, according to the explanation from the responsible land registration authorities in the city's Land Bureau, the purpose of the legislation is to emphasize the connection between the owner and the land. Therefore, they earnestly hope that "every piece of land, every owner, can directly interact with the land authorities." They urge owners to understand the legislative meaning and comply with the laws and regulations. The reporter then raised several questions, which were answered separately. Regarding the land registration deadline, it was stated that, according to regulations, land not registered for its first ownership cannot be registered for rights other than ownership. Therefore, it is necessary to strive for speed in handling the first ownership registration. Within the six districts where registration has begun in the city, there are 210,000 mu of land, totaling 300,000 *qiu*. Of these, over 100,000 *qiu* had land occupation certificates issued before the war. Therefore, the remaining number was initially estimated to be completed within two months. If registration is not completed on time, special circumstances and provisions for supplementary registration applications will be considered. The submission period can actually last for four or five months, which is considered sufficient time.

Application Documents Can Be Returned First

The time spent on registration is unavoidable in the rectification process. Moreover, the original documents submitted by the owners can be returned after review, which should not cause any inconvenience. Regarding the explanation of the 0.4% registration fee, it was stated that the current registration requires a large number of personnel and extensive printing of forms, resulting in significant expenses. In the past, provinces usually levied a land measurement fee before registration. This city has not levied such a fee. The city's finances are currently facing difficulties, and the Bureau has no choice but to be self-sufficient, hence the slight increase in the registration fee. In response to requests from various sectors, a request for reduction has been submitted to the municipal government for approval, but a response has not yet been received.

Deed Tax Can Hopefully Be Exempted

As for the deed tax, the central government also has regulations for registering first and deferring tax reporting. However, the municipal government ordered the consolidation of deed tax collection, so it is being handled together. They hope that owners will register in accordance with the law first. After the registration is completed and the land tax is levied according to the law, the deed tax can hopefully be exempted. Finally, regarding the issue of land valuation, it was stated that the 1941 valuation is only a transitional measure, with an annual cumulative increase of up to 200 times, but the rate of increase is less than a quarter of the general price index increase. The official valuation work is currently underway.

### Repeated Acts of Violence: All Movie Theaters in the City Closed Today

(Our Newspaper's Report) Recently, there have been frequent incidents in the city where individuals resembling soldiers demand free "signed tickets" at movie theaters. Upon refusal, they use violence against theater staff. There have been several incidents in various theaters this month. All movie theaters, large and small, in the city have decided to close for one day today to express sympathy for their injured colleagues. Yesterday, all the movie theaters also

issued a statement stating: "We are legitimate businessmen and strictly abide by national laws. Now that the War of Resistance has been won and the light of day has returned, we are all delighted to start anew and celebrate the revival of the country. Therefore, we have specially formulated preferential treatment methods for soldiers to express our respect for the war heroes who fought for the country and the people. Unexpectedly, unscrupulous individuals, impersonating soldiers, are creating trouble without reason, resorting to violence against theater staff, and escalating their actions, gathering crowds to commit acts of violence. For example, on the 23rd of this month, multiple staff members from the Lido, Great Shanghai, and Nanjing theaters were beaten and injured to varying degrees, and the theaters' assets were damaged. Details of these acts of violence

have been reported in the city's newspapers. In addition to petitioning the relevant authorities to effectively stop these unlawful acts and provide definite and effective protection for our service colleagues, we have collectively decided to close all theaters for one day today to express our deep sympathy for the injured colleagues. We hope that all party, government, and military authorities and people from all walks of life will show their understanding and forgiveness and uphold justice to protect human rights."

Another report: Yesterday at 5:00 PM, a person dressed in a yellow military uniform suddenly appeared at the Dahua Cinema on Nanjing West Road, claiming to be from a certain command's special service team. Due to insufficient military funds, he requested a loan of 400,000 legal currency. After repeated requests by the manager, Zhu Yitian, to reduce the amount, he was given 100,000 legal currency. The person in charge of the theater reported the incident to the authorities last night for the record. It is understood that military and police agencies are strictly investigating and pursuing those who impersonate military personnel and extort money, and will bring them to justice.

### General Manager of Textile Construction Company, Shu Yuzhang, Issues Statement: Received Textile Factories Will Soon Resume Production

The China Textile Construction Company officially started operations yesterday at 138 Jiangxi Road. It is reported that the enemy and puppet textile factories received by the Economic Ministry's special envoy in Shanghai, with over 900,000 spindles and over 40,000 wool spindles, will soon be handed over to the company for management. According to Shu Yunzhang, the company's general manager, who arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday, the enemy and puppet textile factories within the Shanghai area allocated to the Textile Company for management still need to be decided after discussions with the Economic Ministry's special envoy and other relevant agencies. Therefore, the quantity cannot be definitively answered at this time. However, the Textile Company will promptly resume production after taking over these enemy and puppet factories to increase production volume and ensure that the people of the country have sufficient cloth. However, there is currently a major difficulty, which is the

issue of power

Statistics show that there are over 2 million textile spindles in Shanghai, including state-owned, privately owned (including enemy and puppet factories). Based on the current state of power supply, only half can be put into operation. Therefore, the first step is to actively resolve the power issue. The second issue is the raw material supply. Regarding the raw material issue, there should not be too much difficulty because the United States will soon ship a large amount of relief supplies to China. Mr. Shu went on to talk about the company's internal organizational structure, stating that the head office has been decided to be located in Shanghai, with

branch offices in Tianjin and Qingdao

to manage the enemy and puppet textile businesses in the above two places. Yang Yizhou, manager of the Tianjin branch, and Fan Chengchuan, manager of the Qingdao branch, have already gone to establish branch offices and have already completed the takeover of the enemy and puppet textile factories in these two places before Shanghai. In addition, offices have been established in Kunming, Chongqing, Shashi, Hankou, and Xi'an. In the near future, offices will also be established in Guangzhou, Fuzhou, and other places to handle the purchase of cotton and the promotion of the company's products. In the future, branch offices or offices will be added separately depending on local conditions to

expand business

The head office has five departments under its jurisdiction: engineering, business, accounting, auditing, and secretarial. Products will be sold directly by the business department. Finally, Mr. Shu stated that the head office plans to hand over the received enemy and puppet textile factories to private management two years after they are rectified and brought back on track. Whether they will be jointly operated by the government and businesses or entirely handed over to private management will depend on the situation at that time and will be decided by the authorities.

### Tianbin Gold Shop Robbed Three Times

(Our Newspaper's Report) Tianbao Gold Shop, located at 601 Jinling East Road, attached to the Meihua Photo Studio, was suddenly attacked by four robbers at around 11:00 AM yesterday. Two of them showed firearms and robbed more than three taels of pure gold and over two million pseudo-currency. While fleeing, the owner followed them and alerted the police, who arrested one robber. In the afternoon, three more accomplices were apprehended, and two pistols were confiscated. All were taken into custody for investigation. It is reported that the shop has been robbed three times in the past six months. The first time occurred in September. After the police arrested one robber, he was handed over to the Songhu Garrison Headquarters for interrogation. He was found guilty and executed in front of the shop. Within a few months, the shop was robbed twice more.

At around 6:30 PM last night, two soldiers suddenly appeared at 20 Baoyu Lane, Caishi Street, and threatened with guns, robbing two gold rings. While fleeing with the stolen goods, they were encountered by the police bureau's plainclothes sharpshooter team, who arrested the two men and confiscated a pistol. They were taken to the bureau for interrogation.

### Census to Be Completed by the End of February

(Our Newspaper's Report) The Civil Affairs Bureau's household survey will be completed by the end of January next year. The city-wide census will also be completed by February 15th, after which national identity cards will be issued through the district offices. Foreigners will be issued residence permits, which must be applied for at the respective consulates and issued by the police bureau.

Regarding the processing of Baojia (households), Baojia will temporarily be reorganized into groups, with each district responsible for 20 to 70 groups, depending on the size of the tax area. Each group is planned to be divided into 30 Jia. The head of each group will be nominated by the district office on January 8th and temporarily selected by the municipal government. The committee members of each group will be hired by the municipal government.

### A Brief Discussion on the Future of Spoken Drama

— Meng Du

Spoken drama seems to be quite prosperous today. I don't want to discuss the history of spoken drama movement in the past few decades in detail here. This topic is too big for me to solve in a short time; let those who are more capable of this work undertake it. I only hope to briefly explain a few conclusions I have drawn from my current observations of spoken drama, and incidentally, also bring up a little of my hope.

Spoken drama is not native to our country. How will it grow in China, and what will its future be? We know that the cultural changes of every nation and country have their social reasons. The arrival of spoken drama is also like this. The earliest spoken drama was introduced from Japan. At the end of the Qing Dynasty, students studying in Japan launched theatrical performances to exclude the Manchu Qing Dynasty and promote national ideas. These old predecessors imitated the Japanese "Shishi Drama," a form of drama since the Meiji Restoration, "Ronin Shibai." At that time, most of the plays performed were naturally anti-Manchu, but there were also a small number of foreign plays. After the Republic of China, several new drama groups with a more serious style were dissipated due to personnel changes. The remaining new drama groups also gradually deteriorated and declined due to the lack of good leadership and blindly adapting to the commercial environment, and finally degenerated into the "civilized drama troupes" of amusement parks. Later, when the New Culture Movement rose, spoken drama also raised its head again and became the darling of the era of young students. At that time, some gentlemen who had returned from abroad to study drama gradually announced some foreign spoken drama situations. Thus, due to its own needs and external influences, many "Amateur" drama groups appeared in several major cities, such as Peiping and Shanghai, and enthusiastically researched and performed spoken drama. The repertoire included masterpieces by Ibsen, Maeterlinck, Rostand, Wilde, and Shaw. This period can be said to be the heyday of amateur drama. On the eve of the Anti-Japanese War, spoken drama seemed to have returned to the enthusiasm and vigor of the "Spring Willow Society" era at the end of the Qing Dynasty. Thousands of anti-Japanese plays were staged simultaneously across the country to promote hatred of the enemy and righteous revenge. Then came the eight-year long War of Resistance, and spoken drama also accompanied the hard struggle for eight years. Therefore, I conclude that the future of spoken drama should still be in line with the changes in the entire cultural movement, and at the same time, it cannot exist independently of the social environment. In other words, it must be as suitable as possible to China's current national conditions, coordinate and unite with the vast audience as much as possible, and make it able to adapt to the environment here and take root deeply in the soil of our country.

Secondly, I would like to talk about several difficult problems of spoken drama. Currently, the most troublesome thing in Shanghai is the lack of theaters. During the period of the occupation, because British and American films were banned, many movie theaters had a surplus and were converted to perform spoken drama. At most, there were eight or nine theaters performing spoken drama at the same time, which also shows the abnormal prosperity of Shanghai at that time. The nouveau riche merchants needed spoken drama, which was no worse than other entertainment. However, shortly after the victory, foreign films were able to continue to be screened, and many theaters that had previously converted to perform spoken drama successively started showing movies. Theater owners naturally like to make money, and foreign films have an overwhelming advantage over spoken drama, so the previous eight or nine spoken drama theaters suddenly became three, and the abnormal prosperity suddenly became an insignificant recession—however, the roots have sprouted from the soil, and no matter how the outside world suppresses and hinders them, they will still grow tortuously under the big stones. Spoken drama is not only in Shanghai, but has also sown seeds in the remote areas of China and sprouted new branches. It cannot be prevented from developing and thriving by being manipulated and ravaged by merchants alone. Even in times of extreme theater difficulties, we can still realize a "small theater movement," as France and the United States have advocated, to continue our theatrical performances!

Therefore, with a more optimistic view, the lack of theaters is indeed a difficulty, but it is definitely not a fatal blow to spoken drama. What is worth studying is probably still the issue of the audience. That is, the problem of art and business. According to a speech by an old dramatist, the Peking opera audience in Beijing in the era of Boss Tan was multifaceted, with various life experiences, enthusiastic, and lively, that is, many mule drivers and sedan car drivers standing behind the small pond in the teahouse; that situation reminded the old man of the theaters in Shakespeare's time in the sixteenth century, which were also often crowded with many common people who did not pay. Then the key seems to be how to create the ability and leisure for everyone to watch dramas, how to make the performed dramas universally accepted and beneficial to the audience, and how to create theatrical performances that are enthusiastically welcomed by the audience and have artistic value? This should be an important topic that theater managers, stage supervisors, directors, playwrights, actors, stage technicians, and other people engaged in drama and those who care about drama often face.

Here I also thought of several construction tasks of spoken drama, which should be completed as soon as possible. Since spoken drama comes from the West, our understanding of Western acting, even modern drama, is still half-baked and clueless. We can no longer procrastinate and delay, we must encourage people who can translate to introduce famous Western plays as soon as possible in a planned way, from the well-known to the unknown, from the modern to the ancient, one writer, one nation, and one school at a time; at the same time, we must select plays that represent writers, nations, or trends of the times, and perform them faithfully and rigorously, so that our country's acting can complete hundreds of years of Western spoken drama in three or five years. In the process of this work, naturally, the cultivation of writing, directing, acting, and stage technology can be universally improved and deeply studied. Of course, drama groups can set up training classes to train actors, and the establishment of drama schools and drama research associations can also create a large number of excellent technical talents. Coupled with the artistic competition and mutual supervision of amateur drama and professional drama, its influence is enough to form an academic atmosphere. The confluence of these factors may enable Chinese spoken drama to embark on a new track of theatrical movement and move forward rapidly!

What path should Chinese spoken drama take?

I have already said some humble opinions in the above, and it seems that readers can still easily get some news from it. But if I am forced to draw a general conclusion, then I think it is also very simple, that is:

The current trend of world theater is from "art theater" to "people's theater"; our country's acting is relatively backward, so we must complete two tasks at once.——This is the principle. As for the specific guidelines, it is nothing more than the following two points: 1. Introduce famous plays from the world. 2. Create Chinese acting.

### Introducing "Return My Homeland"

— Zhu Xian

Produced by China Film Studio, Written and Directed by Shi Dongshan

The story of "Return My Homeland" unfolds in a small town in North China. The ancient city walls and courtyard-style houses gradually lead to a group of honest and simple people. They finally awakened from the enemy and puppet's cunning schemes to "promote the puppet regime" and erupted into a fiery resistance.

At the beginning, it introduces Pingyang City under the occupation of the enemy and puppet regime. The deserted streets and the heavily guarded city gates with grim guards form a clear contrast. Then, Shenwei, the insidious captain of the enemy guard team, issued instructions to prosper the market. The attitude of the enemy soldiers towards the people suddenly changed so righteously and kindly, and batches of looted goods were given to the residents of the city, adding smiles to the faces of the honest people.

The puppet county magistrate is also desperately recruiting gentry who are hiding in the countryside. At this time, Wang Xiangting appears—a local wealthy man, a strong-willed old man. He has a large amount of property in the city, and also a son, Wang Daoyuan, who is deeply aware of righteousness and is engaged in salvation work. There is a conflict of opinions between father and son on the matter of "returning to the city." The old man finally returns to the city regardless of everything and accepts the position of president of the puppet chamber of commerce. Daoyuan listens to the advice of his friends: "Return to the city meaningfully."

The streets of Pingyang City, which have been deserted for a long time, show a prosperous scene. Crowds of people bustling in the streets come and go under the banners of Sun Beer, opium dens, and casinos, as well as shops full of enemy goods. Under this colorful surface, many sad stories have occurred: Ronin forcibly "buying" shops; a father interfering with his unproductive son in an opium den and being sent to prison, as well as heavy and complicated strange taxes...

Wang Xiangting negotiated with Shenwei on behalf of the business community, but instead was rebuffed. In a situation where the law only protects the Japanese, a small businessman, Chen, died. The sobbing of orphans and widows struck the strong heartstrings of this old man.

At midnight, the sound of gunshots coming from afar outside the city suggests a way out to the suffering people who are awakened from their dreams. Everyone is pregnant with a word that they dare not say. Wang Xiangting also deeply repents and asks Daoyuan to inform the national army outside the city.

Liaison personnel who had sneaked in from outside the city appeared in the city. The enemy searched the entire city, but Tang Jinglun—the worker sent from outside the city to be responsible for the contact—finally received the help of the vast people and the puppet police who had not forgotten their motherland, and did not fall into the hands of the enemy. From this, a large-scale underground activity was launched in the city. The people organized themselves, secretly learned to use the guns and weapons that were transported in, and also launched a donation movement. The envoy disguised himself as a hawker, carrying cloth with banknotes, as well as the people's yearning and hope for the motherland, and went out of the city again. The people in the city were listening quietly to his gradually fading drum sounds.

The lights in the theater suddenly came on, and I woke up as if from a dream. Yes, I relived this eight-year nightmare again, and my heart was so heavy! Now it's over!

In the whole film, there are no sensational big scenes, no exaggerated stimulation, and no excessive rendering, but it deeply grasps the inner transformation of the characters and shows the growth of the people's power. It looks like a lyrical little poem. Shi Dongshan's techniques are always good, and the sound and light are excellent. Among the actors, Qian Qianli is the most successful, portraying a simple and lovely old farmer. Zhang Zhen and Zong You are conscientious, but Tao Jin's Wang Xiangting feels a little too energetic.

### Ouyang Hongying in Chongqing

— Mei Youyun

—Participating in the performance of the New China Drama Society, "Night Tide on the Bund of Shanghai"—

"I am acting, and I am also experiencing life! You have made me taste all kinds of sweet, sour, bitter, and spicy flavors, and you have made me experience the moods of people in various classes!"

Ouyang Hongying wrote such sentences for participating in "Night Tide on the Bund of Shanghai." This red star of the Shanghai drama scene ten years ago has been constantly working hard for drama and seeking to enrich her life.

"Night Tide on the Bund of Shanghai" is a story about the Feng Kuanglin family, who has a high status in Shanghai. He is an upright and patriotic old man. His second son, Zhenxiong, and third daughter, Shuguo, are also patriotic youths, but unfortunately, his eldest son, Shaotang, and eldest daughter-in-law, Huang Siying, are a pair of cowardly, profit-seeking guys. Shaotang uses his father's position to serve as the chief of the special service department of the Japanese gendarmerie and the director of the rice, coal, and cotton yarn control bureau under the Japanese, and is a traitor who oppresses the people, kills compatriots, and commits all kinds of evils. Wei Qingxuan, Shaotang's cousin, also helps the evildoers. Aunt Wei, who works in the Feng family, has a mad son, Dabao, who is an idiot, but knows how to love the country. Zhenxiong was detained by Shaotang because he secretly helped patriotic people blow up the enemy and puppet rice warehouses shortly after returning from the mainland. Kuanglin died of anger because of this. Soon, Shaotang lost power, and the couple were killed by the Japanese. His cousin then took over his position and came to seal up his property under the order of the Japanese. At this time, the news of victory came, and when Qingxuan was about to transform himself and claim to have turned against the enemy, he was inexplicably killed by the madman Dabao leading the crowd.

Hongying plays Huang Siying, which is a very important role, but she plays it very well. Han plays Shaotang, Zongshan plays Kuanglin, Xiatian plays the cousin, and Huang Yuansu plays Shuguo, which adds a lot of color to the script. Xie Tian wrote this script targeting the mistakes of those who want to think that traitors have contributed to the country, and the meaning is very correct. However, there are many rigid and far-fetched places, especially his interweaving of the madman Dabao's role, and at the same time, he gave him a Dabao leading the crowd to kill the traitors at the end, which destroyed the glory of the whole play, and it cannot but be considered a major shortcoming of this script! The scene between Dabao and Doctor Mei is even more meaningless! However, a person who is learning to write a script for the first time can have such achievements, as long as he can continue to learn, he has a bright future!

"Night Tide on the Bund of Shanghai" can cause a sensation in the mountain city and win a lot of praise, mostly because of the efforts of the director, Shen Pangzi, and the neat lineup of actors. Hongying's hard work is also a major reason! December 12th and 13th, in Chongqing

### Chongqing Personnel

It is said that Qin Yi, a female star from the China Film Studio, will marry Shen Chongjiao, a former member of the "Fudan Drama Society" and a famous basketball player, after leaving Chen Tianguo two years ago.

### News from the Ancient Capital's Theaters

### The Chairman Watches Old Dramas in Peiping

— Li Mu

The situation of the theater industry after the victory seems to be more satisfactory than other industries. Good spoken drama scripts that could not be performed under the enemy and puppet regime can now be performed. Peking opera has also swept away the previous vulgar atmosphere of cotton spinning by theater fans and is gradually moving towards regularization. In Shanghai, Dr. Mei Lanfang, who had retired for eight years and was not used by the enemy and puppet regime, took the lead in performing Kunqu opera to celebrate the victory, and performed commercial dramas for ten days. Although the ticket prices were high, the venue was full every night. It is expected that he will soon resume performing excellent Peking opera dramas.

Peiping is the birthplace of Peking opera, but in the past few years, under the ravages of the enemy and puppet regime, the theatrical style has been greatly corrupted. A certain female actor attempted suicide after being criticized by upright people in the society after the victory, which is not worth a laugh from those in the know. Cheng Yanqiu, one of the four famous female actors, also hid as an old farmer because he could not bear the lewd power of the traitors. Meng Xiaodong, the queen of female actors, has always refused to perform on stage.

Chairman Chiang recently went to Peiping and invited famous actors to perform excellent dramas in Huai Ren Hall to entertain foreign guests. On that evening, famous actors such as Cheng Yanqiu, Meng Xiaodong, Li Shifang, Tan Dangying, and Ma Lianliang all took the stage, and the grand occasion was unprecedented in many years. The author recently received a letter from the young female actor Li Shifang, which is described in detail. The following is an excerpt from it: "...I am now performing once every four days to comfort the US military under the agreement of the War Zone Service Corps. The play is Zhen'e Assassinates the Tiger. It has been performed eight times and will continue in the future. Last Tuesday, the Peiping chief entertained General Wyatt, the representative of the British Prime Minister, and the wife of the British Ambassador to China, and invited me to perform The Assassin in the Bankers Association. Last night, I had a commercial play for the first time to sing The Daughter of Heaven, but because Chairman Chiang visited Peiping to perform in Huai Ren Hall to welcome him, my commercial play was suspended. The welcome plays included (1) Tan Fuying's Losing Jieting, (2) Meng Xiaodong and Li Shifang's Wujiapo, (3) Cheng Yanqiu's Hongfu Biography, (4) Ma Lianliang and Li Wanchun's Eight Hammers. The scene was unprecedented. The Chairman and his wife arrived at the same time, as well as many chiefs and hundreds of allied troops. After the performance of Wujiapo, Meng Xiaodong and I went to see the Chairman, he was very kind, and stood up to shake hands and thank us. He also introduced us to the allied military chiefs, so although my hospital returned to the humble house last night, I was so happy to get such a glorious harvest..." From this letter, we know that Li Shifang, Dr. Mei's proud disciple, is also busy in Peiping "assassinating tigers" to comfort the US military. The two masters and apprentices can be called a brilliant example of the north and south, and it is also a good story in the current Peking opera scene.

### "Seagull"

— Li Qinglai

The female writer Shi Jimei and Yu Zhaoming, Fu Xiaofeng, and others have recently organized a completely amateur "Seagull" theater group, which has been filed with the Municipal Party Committee and the Social Bureau. They are currently rushing to rehearse Chen Quan's "Wild Rose" and preparing to perform it in the new year. The director is Feng Zhe, and the actors include Zhang Minyu and Li Qinglai. It is said that Li returned from Chongqing and performed "Metamorphosis," "Tiger Tally," and "Resurrection" in Chongqing, which won a lot of praise from the audience. This time, he and Zhang will take on the role of Xia Huai in "Wild Rose" in an AB system.

### "Donation" and "Entertainment"

— Jiang Shang'ou

In Chongqing, in order to meet wartime needs, in addition to levying a 50% entertainment tax on the ticket prices of entertainment venues, there are also various charitable acts, with additional donations of several tens of percent, etc. In short, a movie ticket, in addition to its own value, also requires 100% of various taxes. Now this practice has been blown to the recovered areas. Recently, the municipal authorities of Nanjing have received orders to levy an additional 40% entertainment tax on all entertainment venues, followed by a continuation of the 40% winter relief donation (there is no doubt that this donation will benefit the poor in the recovered areas). Let's imagine, the "spring relief" and "summer relief" that are waiting for the opportunity will not be difficult to follow. After finishing the writing without a title, it should be said that this is to meet the needs of the recovery.

It is said that this "winter relief donation" will be levied from today and will continue to be levied until March next year—that time is the season of spring and warm flowers! At least the poor who need "winter relief" are not eligible to receive relief in the last period of collection, because it is already spring at that time, so wouldn't it be necessary to respond to the aforementioned need for "spring relief."

Poor old people in winter should receive relief, but relief must be distributed as soon as possible, so that the poor people will benefit greatly; if the money from "donations" is distributed in order, it will become a state of "dragging." To be frank, these seasonal "donations" should be planned and budgeted. Rather than being assigned to everyone who wants to get "spiritual food" (and not called "seeking entertainment"), it is better for the owners of each entertainment venue or the theatrical brokers and film agents to bear a reasonable burden.

Speaking of the naming of the "entertainment tax," there was also a period of struggle, that is, in Chengdu in the rear. The municipal authorities set the "behavior ban tax," and watching movies and listening to Peking opera were all examples of "behavior bans," and taxes should be paid, and its meaning was the same as the need to ban bad behaviors such as visiting brothels and smoking opium. So a gust of wind rose, and public opinion questioned each other. After negotiations with relevant parties, the name was changed to "entertainment tax." The storm of "entertainment tax" was not small.

Do you want to seek entertainment? Please pay the "donation" according to the regulations. "Donation" and "entertainment" are inseparable. Of course, it is an "obligation that should be fulfilled" to "donate happily" in order to obtain entertainment.

### The More You Watch, the More Disappointing It Becomes – The Decline of Yue Opera

— Old Fool

In the past five years, I have seen no less than twenty kinds of local operas from various places. I find that Yue Opera (not the "笃班" [a type of female Yue Opera] disguised as such) has the strictest rules. Take the character Bao Zheng in the opera, for example. In other local operas, he is played by a Jing (painted-face) role, but in Yue Opera, he is played by a Laosheng (old male) role. Bao Zheng is an upright and selfless person, firm but not rough, heroic but with attention to detail. In terms of personality, it is more reasonable to have a Laosheng play him than a Jing role. In Yue Opera, Zhao Kuangyin is indeed played by a Laosheng, but in the play "Gaoping Pass," a Jing role is assigned because Zhao Kuangyin in "Gaoping Pass" is ill-intentioned and cunning, so a Laosheng cannot play him. This shows that Yue Opera's rules are stricter than those of any other local opera. I remember more than ten years ago, when Yue Opera was performed at the Zhabei Grand Theater, the theater authorities, being natives of Yue, specially invited the local leader Mr. Wang Xiaolai to write an inscription. Mr. Wang wrote the four characters "越看越好" (the more you watch, the better it gets). These four characters can be interpreted as people from Shaoxing watching Shaoxing opera and finding it good. At the same time, the character "越" (yue) can be interpreted as "愈" (yu), meaning "the more." Thus, it becomes "the more you watch, the better it gets." Indeed, the organization of Yue Opera is not as simple as Shanghai's Yueju, Hankou's Chu Opera, Henan's Da Bangzi, or Tangshan's Bengbeng. Even when placed among Han Opera, Hui Opera, Sichuan Opera, and Qin Opera, it is not inferior. Plays like "Mat Shed Meeting" (i.e., "Zhu Hen Ji"), "Baolian Lantern," and "San Tongguan" (i.e., "Zhan Jing Tang") are all more outstanding than Peking Opera. However, Yue Opera needs to be watched more to see its good qualities. This is probably what Mr. Wang Xiaolai meant by "the more you watch, the better it gets!"

Alas! Today, Yue Opera is overshadowed by the "improved 笃班" (female Yue Opera) labeled as Yue Opera, and it is in a state of decline. Because Yue people are willing to spend millions to run "improved 笃班" (female Yue Opera) but are unwilling to spend hundreds of thousands to form a Luantan troupe (i.e., Yue Opera). One is buying beauty, and the other is selling art. Naturally, beauty is more easily appealing. Yue Opera has become "越看越難看" (the more you watch, the more disappointing it becomes) in the eyes of most Yue people, and its decline is no wonder.

### John Steinbeck's New Work on the Screen

— Toyoshiba Hara

Among modern American writers, we should know John Steinbeck. His famous work "The Grapes of Wrath" raised a serious issue in American society, saying what others dared not say, and his writing style is sharp and incisive, without the affectation of ordinary self-proclaimed proletarian writers. "The Grapes of Wrath" and his other famous work, "Of Mice and Men," were both adapted into films in 1941, receiving good reviews.

Another book, "Sundown," is an anti-Nazi novel, also made into a film by United Artists, starring Gene Tierney, George Sanders, and Bruce Cabot from "Citizen Kane." This film has received excellent reviews internationally and has already been screened in the mainland.

This summer, Paramount Pictures specially invited him and Jack Wagner to collaborate on a novel suitable for the screen, called "A Medal for Benny." Frank Butler, the famous screenwriter who won an award for "Going My Way" last year, was invited to adapt it into a screenplay. The male and female leads are Dorothy Lamour and French star Arturo de Cordova, while J. Carrol Naish plays an elderly role in the film, with excellent acting skills.

The director of this film, Irving Pichel, has previously created works such as "The New World" (starring Paul Muni) and "The Most Dangerous Game," as far as I know.

Each of Steinbeck's works always provides a clear theme, and this film should be no exception.

### The Distress of Lost Mail – Hoping the Postal Authorities Will Pay Attention

A letter from Mr. Zhu Qilv, a reader of this newspaper, states: "Mr. Editor: I am extremely eager to have you disclose this letter. This is a kind of trouble that I am personally suffering from. Putting myself in others' shoes, I believe everyone feels the same. In the dark era before victory, although this was a common phenomenon, I disdained and was unwilling to cry out! But now, under the care of our own officials, I must appeal, and that is for the loss of letters in the mail. The fact is this: I have two friends, A and B, in Hangzhou. Twenty days ago, when I separated from them and returned to Shanghai, I had a small disagreement with A. A subsequently sent a letter to Shanghai to explain to me, but it was lost. B sent me a letter, and I immediately replied to him, but it was also lost (around November 9th to 14th). A is anxious as to why I would misunderstand him? B misunderstands why I am ignoring him, and I am emotionally waiting for their letters. Thus, all three of us have been played by Hong Qiao (a historical figure famous for losing letters) and have fallen into a net of anxiety and pity. I can no longer be quiet for a moment. I imagined many bad possibilities, and my heart would ache. After fifteen days of torment, A's second letter finally arrived. He still thought I had not calmed down! And B, because I asked someone to bring him a letter, also sent a quick letter. Everything was cleared up, but we were all disappointed by it. B wanted to argue with the post office. I said don't bother, let's ask the postal authorities to make improvements. I also ask you, sir, to assist us and not throw this request letter in the wastebasket! Respectfully wishing you peace."

### A Carefree Discussion on Quitting Smoking (5)

— Hu Qi

6.  Maintaining Health During Smoking Cessation

Patients during the period of smoking cessation should gradually eliminate all abnormal lifestyle habits that existed while smoking, such as irregular eating, staying up all night, and getting up at dusk, all of which are harmful to the body's health. Therefore, during the process of smoking cessation, one should pay special attention to maintaining mental health, abstaining from sexual activity, and exercising appropriately at regular times, but avoid overexertion to prevent other obstacles from occurring.

7.  Post-Cessation Attention and Relapse

Once the smoking addiction has been quit, those with weak bodies should continue to recuperate in order to recover as soon as possible. Occasionally, there may be uncomfortable symptoms such as withdrawal phenomena after quitting. Do not be suspicious or afraid, thinking it is a relapse. In fact, the so-called relapse is entirely psychological. It should be known that ordinary people often experience pain, yawning, depression, insomnia, etc. when the dog days are abnormal or when the body is fatigued. Why is it that when someone who has smoked before suffers from it, it is called relapse? If you feel very uncomfortable or if an old illness recurs, you should seek medical treatment and not try to use tobacco again, otherwise, it will be easier to become addicted than the first time.

8.  Conclusion

Based on my clinical experience of more than ten years, I dare to represent all doctors with smoking cessation experience and advise those who are suffering from tobacco addiction: "There are very few examples of smoking addictions that cannot be quit." Now that the Anti-Japanese War has been won, the laws prohibiting smoking have been promulgated. I sincerely hope that smokers will have firm faith and determination to quit smoking as soon as possible to free themselves from a lifelong shackle, eliminate tobacco addiction, and wash away a great national shame. This is what I silently pray for. (The End)
