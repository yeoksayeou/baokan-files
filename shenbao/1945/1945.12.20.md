### The Majestic Evergreen of Purple Mountain Remains Intact: Chairman Pays Reverent Visit to Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Mausoleum

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 19th] At 12:30 PM on the 19th, Chairman Chiang visited the mausoleum. He traveled simply and discreetly, known to very few. While gazing upon the benevolent visage of the Father of the Nation, the Chairman stood in silent contemplation for three full minutes and personally inspected every part of the mausoleum grounds. Subsequently, the Chairman also paid his respects at the cemetery of fallen soldiers.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing Dispatch, 19th] Chairman Chiang, accompanied by his wife, visited Premier Sun Yat-sen's mausoleum at noon on the 19th, with Bureau Chief Yu Jishi in attendance. After visiting the mausoleum, they also went to the Memorial Hall for Fallen Soldiers at Lingxi Temple and Tan Yankai's tomb, where they stood in contemplation for a long time. The Chairman's car arrived at the front gate of the mausoleum, and he slowly ascended the steps, reaching the pavilion in about twenty minutes. There, he and his wife stood side by side before the statue of the Premier, presented a flower garden, and bowed their heads in silent prayer for three minutes before offering the highest salute. After the ceremony, they gazed upon the remains in solemn silence for a long time. They then entered the hall, circled the coffin once, and stepped out of the main hall, inspecting each offering before the hall. There was a massive bronze cauldron pierced by enemy artillery fire eight years ago. The Chairman immediately instructed Ma Xiang, the head of the Mausoleum Management Committee's Security Guard, to erect a plaque with an inscription to preserve the memory. Recalling that Chairman Chiang bid farewell to the mausoleum on December 8, 1937, before leaving Nanjing to lead the war of resistance in Wuhan, it has been eight years and ten days until his victorious return to pay respects at the mausoleum. The purple mountain, evergreen pines, and lush cypress trees are filled with auspicious atmosphere. The mausoleum stands majestically unharmed. The Chairman, leading all party comrades and fellow citizens nationwide in long-term, arduous struggle, has finally recovered the ancestral land and can report this to the spirit of the Premier in Heaven.

[Our Beiping Dispatch, 18th] The Chairman traveled south at noon on the 18th. Originally, he intended to inspect other locations, but due to Marshall's arrival in China and the impending Political Consultative Conference, he departed from Beiping earlier than planned. The Chairman's week-long stay in Beiping has gradually brought coordination to party, government, and military work, and has revitalized the hearts of the people in North China, who were not without disappointment. After the news of the Chairman's departure from Beiping spread on the 18th, the people reluctantly bid farewell, many spontaneously lining the streets in the face of the howling north wind, waiting to see him off. As the Chairman's car passed, cheers rose to the clouds. The Chairman and his wife frequently waved back from the car, seemingly unable to bear to leave the former capital's residents.

[Central News Agency, Chongqing Dispatch, 19th] Foreign Minister Wang Shijie, upon the summons of Chairman Chiang, flew to Nanjing on a special plane at 1:00 AM on the 19th, accompanied by Zhang Pingqun, a counselor of the Executive Yuan.

[Central News Agency, Beiping Dispatch, 19th] Before Chairman Chiang left Beiping, he personally instructed Sun Lianzhong, Chairman of Hebei Province, to ensure that all counties and cities in Hebei Province ban drugs and opium, just as Beiping and Tianjin have done. This must be completely eliminated within three months of recovery; otherwise, the responsible local officials will be punished for dereliction of duty.

### Marshall Arrives in Shanghai Today; Will Not Linger Long and Will Proceed to Nanjing to Meet Chairman Chiang

[Our Dispatch] Marshal George C. Marshall, the newly appointed U.S. Special Envoy to China, is scheduled to arrive here by plane this afternoon. Mayor Qian Dajun, Deputy Mayor He Dequi, Lieutenant General Albert Wedemeyer, Commander of U.S. Forces in the China Theater, and other Chinese and American officials are all preparing to welcome him at Jiangwan Airport. After disembarking, Marshal Marshall will inspect the honor guard sent by our New Sixth Army to welcome him at the airport, as well as the U.S. military police honor guard. The municipal government authorities have already begun preparing a grand reception for Marshal Marshall hosted by Mayor Qian, but the date and location will be decided after Marshal Marshall arrives in Shanghai. According to information from U.S. Military Headquarters, Marshal Marshall will rest at the Cathay Hotel after arriving in Shanghai and may host local news reporters on the same day. The U.S. news liaison officer is scheduled to accompany reporters to the airport to welcome him at 11:45 AM today. Marshal Marshall plans to stay in Shanghai for one or two days.

[Our Dispatch] San Francisco Radio broadcast on the 19th that Chairman Chiang will fly to Shanghai tomorrow to meet with Marshal Marshall. Chairman Chiang expressed his willingness to reach a peaceful resolution with the Communist Party. At the same time, Ye Jianying, the Chief of Staff of the Communist Army currently in Chongqing, also expressed his willingness to lay down arms. News also indicates that Foreign Minister Wang Shijie has flown to Nanjing to assist Chairman Chiang in receiving General Marshall. Chinese observers believe that Chairman Chiang will meet with Marshall in Nanjing and then depart at a suitable time to inspect various parts of China. Chairman Chiang and Marshall will spend several days in Nanjing before flying to Chongqing together to participate in the Political Consultative Conference.

[Central News Agency, This City Dispatch] Marshal George C. Marshall, the 66-year-old U.S. Special Envoy to China, is scheduled to arrive at Jiangwan Airport at 1:00 PM today. Various Chinese and American leaders here have all made arrangements to go to the airport to welcome him. Marshal Marshall will stay at the Cathay Hotel, in the room previously occupied by General Wedemeyer. The U.S. Theater Headquarters here has also prepared the only large desk in the area for Marshal Marshall's use, if he wishes. This desk was originally used by Major Weiss, the director of the U.S. War Crimes Tribunal.

[United Press, Manila Dispatch, 19th] General George C. Marshall, the newly appointed U.S. Special Envoy to China, arrived in Manila by plane this afternoon, two and a half hours earlier than scheduled. After disembarking, Marshall immediately took a car to inspect the devastated city of Manila and plans to fly to China tomorrow morning, arriving in Shanghai on the same day. Today, according to a telegram from the Chinese community, Marshall will go to Nanjing to meet Chairman Chiang and then travel to Chongqing together.

[Our Dispatch] Sir Mark Aitchison Young, the British Governor of the Philippines, is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai from Manila at approximately 4:00 PM today. Young plans to stay in Shanghai briefly and will hold important talks with Marshal George C. Marshall and General Albert Wedemeyer.

[United Press, Beiping Dispatch, 19th] Today, according to sources close to the Chairman, it is expected that the Chairman will meet with Marshal Marshall in Nanjing. (Yesterday, the Chairman told a reporter that he would meet the new U.S. Ambassador to China, Marshal Marshall, during his tour of major cities in the formerly occupied areas.) Sources close to the Chairman indicate that the Chairman's reaction to President Truman's statement on China policy is quite favorable. It is said that the Chairman only read President Truman's report once while stationed in Beiping and will reread it in detail at an appropriate time. Top Chinese sources revealed that Chiang Kai-shek paid close attention to the situation in Northeast China while in Beiping. It is said that he was pleased with the "smooth progress" of the Sino-Soviet negotiations in Changchun. During his stay in Beiping, he also closely monitored various issues related to the withdrawal of the military and civilians in North China. Sources close to the Chairman emphasized the need to accelerate the withdrawal of Japanese military and civilians because U.S. ships will soon be unavailable. They hope that all Japanese troops will be withdrawn within two months, estimating that there are still 4 million Japanese remaining in China, Taiwan, northern Vietnam, and the nine provinces of Northeast China. Over one million Japanese are located between the Great Wall and Guangzhou, half of whom are military personnel.

### With Representatives Conference of Various Parties Imminent, Optimism Increases, High Hopes Pinned on Marshall's Arrival in China

[United Press, Chongqing Dispatch, 19th] According to observers here, representatives from both the Nationalists and the Communists, especially the Communist representatives, will make concessions to the limit in future peace talks. Both sides want to show U.S. Special Envoy Marshall their sincerity in seeking peace.

[United Press, This City Dispatch] China today is more hopeful than it was at the end of the war. Since the Nationalist army entered the nine provinces of Northeast China by land, and the vanguard approached Shenyang or has already entered the city, the optimistic trend of resolving the internal strife has arisen from this. Furthermore, with the new U.S. Special Envoy to China, Marshal George C. Marshall, having departed from Washington for China, Chiang Kai-shek visiting Beiping to inspect the core of the disturbances in North China, and President Truman announcing U.S. policy, calling for a ceasefire between the Nationalists and the Communists, and a national conference of representatives from major political parties, the level of optimism has further increased. All parties are holding their breath and eagerly awaiting Marshall's arrival in China, with high expectations. The Nationalist Party certainly hopes to retain more of former Ambassador Hurley's plan, but no one knows whether the U.S. President appointed such a powerful figure as Marshal Marshall merely to implement Hurley's undeniably central government assistance plan without any changes. U.S. troops stationed in China are also very concerned about Marshall's arrival in China. Many of them deeply believe that they cannot return home if the Chinese civil war does not stop. If Marshall's visit can restore peace to China, it will remove the obstacles to the U.S. military's return home. In addition, there is something that the outside world has not paid attention to, that is, foreign businessmen are also eagerly awaiting Marshall's visit. They are all afraid that China's new company law will restrict their business, and they are deeply worried about inflation and China's uncertain post-war attitude. Now they are speculating that the United States' appointment of this great figure as the special envoy to China will seek to be more aggressive in trade with China, or to obtain a permanent leadership role.

Short Commentary

### Welcome Special Envoy Marshall

President Truman's Special Envoy Marshal George C. Marshall is arriving in China to take office. This visit by the Special Envoy will surely benefit our country, will surely benefit the stability of the East Asian order, and will surely benefit world peace. The Chinese people have high expectations for Marshal Marshall's mission to China. As an outstanding military leader, he relied on his strategy to achieve glorious victory. His achievements are not only limited to his own country but also in the entire world and all of humanity. Now that the enemy has been defeated, the Marshal has honorably retired. He should have been resting in the mountains, but instead, he has taken on a new mission and traveled thousands of miles to China. We first express our heartfelt admiration to President Truman for choosing such a person as the Marshal to be his special envoy to China; and we are pleased that the Marshal has not refused to travel far to China. Marshal George C. Marshall is not only an outstanding military leader but also an outstanding diplomat, unanimously praised internationally. This visit to China will, it is believed, be able to use his outstanding military and diplomatic talents to establish indelible achievements for China, for the Far East, and for world peace.

Indeed, the development of the situation in China is related to the peace of the entire world. The United States has shouldered the heaviest burden in the effort to defeat the Axis powers; therefore, it also bears the heaviest burden in the reconstruction of world peace. From the fact that Truman chose such a person as the Marshal to be his special envoy to China, it can be known how much the United States cares about the development of the situation in China. In the process of clarifying the situation in China, outstanding figures with both military and diplomatic talents, like Marshal George C. Marshall, are needed. As the special envoy arrives in China for the first time, the Chinese people extend their sincere welcome.

### Marshall, Special Envoy: From Our Research Department

When Marshall was appointed Special Envoy to China on November 27th, we used a corner of this newspaper to tell readers that Marshall was a symbol of guaranteed American security. Today, on the occasion of his arrival in China, we would like to add that he is a symbol of promoting Chinese unity and Far Eastern security.

Marshall has long been proven in America as the most suitable figure for military duties in a democratic political system. Whether in the Senate or the House of Representatives, whether Democrat or Republican, all place complete faith in him. Similarly, in China, whether in or out of government, whether the Kuomintang, the Communist Party, or other political parties, all have recognized him as a great force and hope. This point will be concretely proven in his future work.

Marshall's relationship with China and the Far East did not begin today; it should be traced back to around the time of World War I. He came to the Far East twice to study the military situation, for a total of two years. Before the war, he came as a junior officer, but he had already fully demonstrated his astonishing military talent. After the war, due to his powerful display of planning and combat capabilities, coupled with General Pershing's appreciation and high regard for him, he was promoted to a military position, enabling him to wear the brigadier general's star. In 1902, he was once stationed in the Philippines, leaving office and returning to the United States the following year. When he returned to the Philippines in 1913, he served for three years. During World War I, he voluntarily went to the Eastern Provinces (then known as the Three Eastern Provinces) to inspect the actual situation of the Russo-Japanese War battlefield. In early 1924, Marshall (then holding the rank of lieutenant colonel) came to China again, serving in the U.S. 15th Infantry Brigade, stationed in Tianjin. At that time, he seized many opportunities to travel to various parts of our country. In 1927, he served as the supervisor of the U.S. Army Chinese Language Training Class. Judging from this long history, General Marshall has come to China for the third time. Each time his qualifications are different, and his missions are different, but his success is the same. Precisely because of his past achievements, we believe that he will accomplish even more achievements in his future work.

Marshall's high promotion of the democratic spirit is worth emphasizing. Not only in politics, but even in the military, he reveals a lovely democratic tendency everywhere. For example, when he discussed the methods of selecting officers, he mentioned that the elements of the army should be improved, and the elements of the army lie in maintaining the excellent quality of officers at all levels, so he believes that the selection of officers should be based on democratic methods. All capable officers who are good at leadership should be given opportunities for advanced studies to cultivate good generals.

Especially at present, when China is not yet fully unified, and all parties expect Marshall to provide assistance, he has brought President Truman's instructions, and there must be new plans and new developments in this regard. Just as he was able to complete in two years the work that the Germans had taken ten years under military politics, he will definitely be able to help our country shorten the distance between various political parties and the National Government in a very short time. And, if there are any gaps in between, Marshall will do his best to eliminate them fundamentally, so that all political parties can truly unite around the National Government and reach a fully unified domain under the command of the supreme leader, Chairman Chiang.

Speaking of his work attitude, Marshall has always earned the admiration of the world with his seriousness and dedication. His energy is unmatched by young officers. He cherishes time, strictly adheres to rules, and has not taken a single day off since he became Chief of Staff. If an "absent" sign is found in his office, then he must be taking his plane to inspect something, and it will never be for personal matters. Inspection flights are one of his habits. Whenever time permits, he often personally sets out for on-the-spot inspections, and he is never willing to rely solely on other people's eyes and ears to make subjective judgments. Due to this kind of life spirit and habit, we believe that this time he comes to China, he will definitely find ways to solve all the problems in front of him through deep observation, and the results will inevitably be satisfactory.

Marshall is taking on the job of special envoy to China at the high age of 65 this year. Some people may worry about his health. In fact, he looks as young as someone in their thirties or forties. He doesn't know what hardship or fatigue is; he only knows that work comes first. This is precisely why the United Nations respects him. In this war, he was able to cope with as many as nine theaters of war, command troops distributed across six continents, arrange the operational plans for each theater, and allocate all the necessary supplies to each theater. At the same time, he maintained close ties with the U.S. Congress, the Navy Department, the State Department, and the White House, and engaged in intimate guidance with his subordinates. Looking at his past work, he is simply what Americans call "like watching a complete, well-tuned, and powerful machine driving the work."

Marshall's confidentiality is shocking. He understands that to do well, one must be secretive. During Marshall's military operations, on one occasion, he moved one million people and their equipment in front of the German army within fourteen days without attracting the enemy's attention or preparations. This shows his special ability.

### Zhang and Chiang Fly to Beijing to Report to Chairman: Technical Matters of Taking Over Await Negotiation; The Main Reason for Delays in Air Transport by National Army is the Climate

[Our Beiping, 19th Telegram] Zhang Jia'ao and Chiang Ching-kuo left Beiping by plane at 9:00 am on the 19th to report everything to the Chairman. Before leaving, Zhang told our reporter that the reason we have been slow to take over the Northeast is not purely due to diplomatic issues; we ourselves still have some problems to be solved, such as the preparation of winter clothing, which is one example. Zhang and Chiang were summoned by the Chairman's telegram and were originally scheduled to fly to Beiping to report on the 17th. At that time, due to the climate in Changchun reaching minus 20 degrees Celsius, the plane froze and could not take off, resulting in a one-day delay and failing to meet the Chairman in Beiping. According to inquiries from various sources, the principles of the Sino-Soviet negotiations have been determined, but some technical issues remain to be negotiated. Considering the lessons learned from the relocation of the Northeast Headquarters to Ping this past month, the authorities are particularly cautious about military and political takeover matters this time and have decided to proceed with the takeover only after all issues have been resolved. When Zhang Jia'ao passed through Ping last time, he denied that the Sino-Soviet negotiations in Chongqing involved the issue of Northeast industries and mines, but it is generally believed that the economic development of the Northeast is still the last remaining issue.

[Our Dispatch] San Francisco Radio reported on the 19th that, according to the latest news, the Sino-Soviet negotiations have concluded. Dubing's troops can immediately dispatch "liaison teams" to the Russian military districts. Currently, the climate in Changchun is extremely cold, at minus 22 degrees Celsius, and the planes are freezing, making it impossible to start, which is the main reason for the delay in air transport by the National Army. A certain newspaper reported that the Communist Party massacred 20,000 civilians in Zhangjiakou, their "crime" being "anti-communism."

[Central News Agency, Changchun, 18th Telegram] The head of our military delegation, Dong Yanping, held a second meeting with Lieutenant General Trotsky, Chief of Staff of the Soviet Army, at 3:00 pm today, and some decisions were made on military liaison issues between the two sides. The Headquarters of the Commander-in-Chief of the Northeast Security Command can dispatch liaison officers to contact the Soviet Army. Today's meeting lasted for two hours, and Huang and Te will hold a third conversation in the near future.

[United Press, Beiping, 19th Telegram] It is reported that the National Army will land on Huludao Island. Since the U.S. State Department issued instructions to General Wedemeyer, there is no longer any problem with the U.S. Seventh Fleet transporting the National Army northward again. Among the supplies transported to Huludao Island will be approximately 500 trucks for use in transporting after the National Army lands.

[United Press, Tianjin, 19th Telegram] Two thousand three hundred U.S. overseas troops arrived here today and were exchanged with the same number of troops in North China.

### Ye Jianying Talks:

Communist Army Headquarters Moves to Zhangyuan

[Our Chongqing, 19th Telegram] Ye Jianying told reporters today: (1) The most intense battle areas between the Kuomintang and Communist armies are in Central China, North China, Zhangjiakou, Chengde, Chaoyang, and other places. (4) In the past two years, the number of people captured by the U.S. Communist Army totaled 118. (3) The Communist Army Headquarters has moved from Yan'an to Zhangjiakou.

### U.S. President Consults Congress Yesterday: Recommends Establishing a Department of Defense; Merging the Army and Navy, Establishing Three Branches of the Air Force, and Vigorously Advocating Preparing for Everything to Cope with Atomic Warfare

[United Press, Washington, 19th Telegram] President Truman consulted Congress today to transform the Army and Navy departments into a single Department of Defense to demonstrate to the world that the United States is taking everything seriously and preparing for everything during this atomic warfare era. President Truman warned that future wars would break out more suddenly than past wars, and the United States would likely be the first to bear the brunt. The current merger of the Army and Navy will be the most effective step to prepare for contingencies. President Truman's extremely clear recommendation is an absolute victory for the Army Department. The recommendation includes seven points and is attached to a request for compulsory military training for young people aged 18 to 20. Since the recommendation completely aligns with the Army Department's plan, Navy Secretary Forrestal and his subordinates who oppose this plan will either submit their resignations or openly conflict with the President; otherwise, they will have to cease their opposition. President Truman requested that Congress approve the following points: (1) Establish a single Department of Defense, responsible for all national security, including all armed and civilian forces currently under the Army and Navy departments. (2) The Secretary of Defense will be a civilian appointed by the President, with multiple non-military deputy secretaries and assistants. (3) The Air Force will be divided into three branches, each headed by a deputy secretary, resulting in a unified air force, but the Navy will retain separate aircraft carriers and air force units based on the water. (4) All deputy secretaries and assistant secretaries will accept assignments designated by the President or the Secretary of Defense. (5) The President and the Secretary of Defense will have the power to establish coordinating and service agencies, which will be located in areas where materials are obtained to reduce expenses. (6) The Department of Defense will appoint a Chief of Staff and three commanders subordinate to him from the Army, Navy, and Air Force. (7) The Chief of Staff and the three commanders of the Army, Navy, and Air Force will form an advisory committee to make recommendations to the President. (8) To avoid overemphasis on any one part, President Truman recommended that the appointment of the Chief of Staff should be based on a rotating system, rotating at least every two or three years. The President concluded, "I dare to assure Congress that once this merger is adopted as a national policy, both civilian and military officials will do their best to ensure the success of this merger."

[Reuters, Washington, 19th Telegram] The Baltimore Sun reported that, according to authoritative sources, key members of Truman's cabinet, Wallace, Ickes, Forrestal, and Judge Schwellenbach, will resign in 1946. The White House refused to confirm or deny this report. The Baltimore Sun reported that Wallace will lead the left-wing Democratic Party after resigning as Secretary of Commerce. Interior Secretary Ickes will resign to pursue his private life. Labor Secretary Judge Schwellenbach plans to resign next year to run for Senator of Washington State, and Navy Secretary Forrestal also plans to resign next year.

### Memoirs of Konoe Fumimaro: Soviet Policy Before Participating in the War; Willing to Join the German-Italian-Japanese Alliance to Dominate the East and Attempt to Include Iran and India in the Soviet Sphere of Influence

[United Press, Tokyo, 19th Telegram] Konoe Fumimaro's posthumous memoirs state that in the late 1940s, the Soviet Union had in principle agreed to join the German-Italian-Japanese Tripartite Pact, becoming the Quadruple Entente to dominate the East. According to the attached secret agreement, Iran and India would become the Soviet Union's future sphere of influence, Japan would obtain the South Seas, Germany would take Central Africa, and Italy would gain North Africa, but this plan did not progress. Three months after the agreement in principle was established, German officials openly discussed the German-Soviet war. Japan formally proposed to the German government to avoid war with the Soviet Union, but the German side set it aside, saying that the German-Soviet war could be concluded in two or three months. Konoe strongly implied that he and Japan were both fooled by the power politics of Berlin, and said that neither Germany nor the Soviet Union attached importance to establishing an alliance. Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka knew that war was possible between Germany and the Soviet Union, so he signed a neutrality treaty with the Soviet Union to consolidate Japan's position. Konoe repeatedly mentioned Japan's hope that the Soviet Union would join the Tripartite Pact to be close to the Soviet Union and the Axis powers. Germany, at least before Soviet People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Molotov visited Berlin in November 1940, was moving towards cooperation between Japan, Germany, and the Soviet Union. German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop proposed a four-power agreement plan, including the following points: (1) The Soviet Union declared its agreement to the principles of the Tripartite Pact to prevent war and help quickly restore peace. (2) The Soviet Union recognized the leadership of Germany, Italy, and Japan in the new order in Europe and Asia, and the three countries also guaranteed to respect Soviet territory. (3) The three countries had guaranteed not to assist any enemy of the allied countries, nor to participate in such national groups. In addition, it stipulated the establishment of a secret agreement on future spheres of influence. The Japanese government immediately approved this plan, and when Molotov visited Berlin, the German side also proposed it to him, but until Matsuoka went to Germany in March 1941, Tokyo had not heard from it since.

### The U.S. Helps Us Build a Navy: We Express Our Extreme Welcome

[United Press, Washington, 19th Telegram] After Secretary of the Navy Forrestal proposed that surplus U.S. ships be made available to China, Chinese naval attaché to the U.S. Rear Admiral Liu Tingfu said today, "So far, I have not had the opportunity to study the full text of the proposal, but any assistance from the United States in this regard, I believe, will be welcomed by China."

### U.S. Embassies and Consulates in Asia Will Undergo Major Expansion

[United Press, Washington, 18th Telegram] U.S. State Department inspector Butler, who has just returned from overseas, expects that U.S. embassies and consulates in Asia, from North China to Cambodia and India, will be greatly expanded. Butler traveled in Asia for three months and has reopened most of the U.S. consulates in China, Hong Kong, Vietnam, the Malay Peninsula, and the East Indies, with a portion of the staff starting to work first, and will soon increase to the normal number of people to provide appropriate protection to American people and American interests in Asia. Other embassies and consulates will also be restored immediately. Butler served as chargé d'affaires at the U.S. Embassy in Beiping at the beginning of the war.

### Pauley's Report to the Reparations Committee's U.S. Representative

[United Press, Washington, 18th Telegram] Pauley, the U.S. presidential special envoy to the Japanese Reparations Committee, submitted an interim report to Truman and will also submit it to the Soviet Union and countries seeking reparations from Japan. According to Pauley, Japan had 154 people per square kilometer during the war, so the country's economy was unable to cope with reparations in terms of production. Furthermore, since Korea, Taiwan, and other places have been cut off, and Japanese people have continued to return to the country, its population will reach 208 people per square kilometer, making it quite difficult to provide for them. As for how much personal income Emperor Hirohito has, there are no statistics, but U.S. reparations officials regard the Emperor as just like other Japanese, and all his wealth should be used for reparations.

### U.S. Governor-General to Korea Arrived in Seoul Yesterday

[United Press, Seoul, 19th Telegram] Former U.S. Army Provost Marshal General Hodge, who is about to take office as Governor-General of Korea, arrived here today and told reporters for the first time: "The U.S. occupation policy has not changed. I will strive to achieve the original goal, which is to help Korea automatically become an independent country as soon as possible."

### Tension Increases at the Three-Power Conference; Enters Concrete Discussion Stage; Contents Are Closely Guarded Secrets, and No Communiqué Has Been Issued to Date; Soviet People Welcome Stalin's Return to Handling National Affairs

[Reuters, Moscow, 19th Telegram] The three-power foreign ministers' meeting lasted for three hours and twenty minutes yesterday, and no statement has yet been issued. It is expected that the situation will become even more tense when the meeting continues today. Among the advisors to the three foreign ministers are experts on the Balkans, Iran, the governance of Germany, and the Far East, which shows that these issues will be raised for discussion. It is reported that the atmosphere in the initial meetings was indeed extremely friendly.

[Reuters, Moscow, 19th Telegram] The three-power foreign ministers' meeting is being conducted with great secrecy. Authoritative sources only say that the meeting had a good start. Otherwise, only yesterday's meeting or already entered the stage of specific discussion. It is difficult for the outside world to know the other circumstances. Observers speculate that the talks chaired by U.S. Secretary of State Burns yesterday afternoon, if they have indeed entered the stage of concrete discussion, will be longer than the previous talks. So far, the representatives seem to still be discussing technical issues. British Foreign Secretary Bevin visited Molotov before the meeting yesterday afternoon. Informed sources said that Bevin and Burns will pay their respects to Stalin. The Russians welcomed Stalin's return from his leave to handle national affairs again. Bevin is very concerned about the Iran incident and once again met with British Ambassador to Iran Prat to inquire about everything. Burns also summoned one of his staff, an Iran expert from the U.S. Embassy in Tehran, who had just arrived in Soviet capital from Tehran, to report to Burns. Also, according to our Washington news: Reliable sources in the U.S. capital say that the three-power foreign ministers' meeting will discuss the Spanish question.

[Reuters, London, 19th Telegram] The secret nature of the Moscow meeting, although it has its reasons, is also related to the Soviet Union's intensified implementation of news censorship. Because the most important items on the agenda, such as the atomic issue and the Iran issue, have a major impact on the entire world, it is necessary to strictly maintain diplomatic secrecy. The Soviet Union's censorship system was relaxed once after the end of October this year, and in November and early December, Moscow correspondents were given reasonable freedom to send news, but it became strict again shortly before the three-power conference was held.

### U.S. Counterintelligence Unit Takes Over Japanese Secret Service - A Tool Used by Tojo to Control the People; Secret Torture Chamber to be Opened Regularly

[United Press Tokyo, 19th] The U.S. Counterintelligence Unit today formally took over the Japanese Secret Service (also known as the "Terror Squad" Headquarters). This light gray, modern building overlooking the moat of the Imperial Palace has served as headquarters for ten years. The building has four floors, of which the middle floor, it is said, was occupied by the dreaded Secret Service, from where orders were issued, enabling Prime Minister Tojo to absolutely control the Japanese people. In its basement, Japanese people of all classes, as well as Americans, were secretly imprisoned and subjected to private torture. The headquarters has its own telephone system connecting all departments, and is equipped with powerful radio transmitting and receiving equipment, allowing direct communication with secret service units throughout the Far East. In 1940, Reuters' Tokyo bureau chief, James Cox, fell to his death from a fourth-floor window of this building. According to the Japanese Times at the time, Cox was arrested on July 19 of that year, along with "an unspecified number of foreigners," and Cox committed suicide to "avoid divulging secrets." The Secret Service also claimed that prison officials had tried to stop him, but the U.S. official conclusion was that he either jumped from the window under torture or was pushed by the Japanese. Subsequently, on the day of the Pearl Harbor attack, United Nations reporters were arrested at this Secret Service headquarters and interrogated on charges of "espionage." The head of the United Press Tokyo bureau, Mr. Hillis, was also among them. According to a U.S. Counterintelligence Unit investigator, Foreign Minister Yoshida was also once imprisoned in a cement basement, isolated from the outside world for forty-five days. In the next room, Bishop Tsugai of the Tokyo Methodist Church was imprisoned for one hundred and fifty days. It is reported that three U.S. B-29 pilots were also arrested at that time, but were soon released. At today's brief handover ceremony, a stone tablet inscribed with the "Japanese Bill of Rights," draped with the U.S. flag, was unveiled to signify the liberation of the Japanese people by the U.S. military occupation. Afterwards, the building will no longer be a secret torture chamber, but will be opened regularly to hear the grievances of the Japanese people.

### Iranian Issue - Touchstone for Three-Power Cooperation

[United Press Washington, 19th] Today, senior officials told United Press that Chairman Stalin's return to Moscow provides Secretary of State Byrnes and Foreign Secretary Bevin with a better opportunity to have the Soviet Union withdraw from Iran and for the three powers to reach an agreement on the Iranian issue that complies with the Tehran Declaration. It is believed that Molotov was clearly unwilling to make concessions regarding the establishment of the Azerbaijan autonomous government, as it has become a fait accompli, which displeased Stalin. However, if Byrnes and Bevin present the issue as the basis for continued cordial relations among the three powers, Stalin may reconsider. United Press has learned that Byrnes accepts the Azerbaijan provincial government as representing the will of the people and insists that the issue must be discussed in accordance with the Tehran Agreement. According to well-informed sources, Bevin will support Byrnes with the utmost determination, but with slightly different intentions, saying that the British fear Soviet intrusion into the Middle East. United Press has learned that U.S. officials are deeply concerned about the situation in Iran, as they believe that the Iranian issue is the clearest test of whether the world can achieve harmony and cooperation under the promotion of the United Nations.

### British and American Representatives - Constantly in Contact with Their Home Countries

[United Press Moscow, 19th] U.S. Secretary of State Byrnes and the British Foreign Secretary, as well as the British and American envoys in Moscow, are constantly in contact with their respective governments by telegram or direct telephone. Weather permitting, British messengers fly to London daily. Foreign Secretary Bevin is keeping the British Dominions fully informed of the conference's progress, and the Chinese and French ambassadors are able to contact Bevin and Byrnes at any time. It is believed that Byrnes and Bevin will meet with Chairman Stalin on Friday or before, which is also Stalin's birthday.

### Iran Calls for Respect for the Tehran Declaration - Unrest Still Spreading

[Reuters Tehran, 19th] Iranian Prime Minister Hakimi yesterday, amidst cheers in parliament, reiterated his decision to go to Moscow and again request the withdrawal of British, American, and Soviet troops stationed in Iran. It is also learned that the Democrats in northern Iran are advancing towards the Caspian Sea, and it is feared that the unrest in northern Iran cannot be prevented from spreading to the Kuji tribes in Iraq and Turkey. According to the Iranian Ambassador to Britain, speaking in London, the Soviet Union's interference in Iranian affairs in various ways is a blatant violation of the Tehran Declaration of December 1943.

[Reuters London, 19th] The Iranian Ambassador to Britain issued a statement saying that Iran deeply hopes that the Moscow Conference can reach an agreement that respects the integrity of Iranian sovereignty. At a time when the United Nations is being established, it is heartbreaking and disappointing for the Iranian people that a faction within Iran is instigating the people to deny their own government and launch a separatist movement. This is a tragic example of treaty violation and a test of whether treaties, the Atlantic Charter, the United Nations Charter, and the joint declaration of the three powers will be respected after the war.

### British Wartime Prime Minister - To Go to the United States for Rest

[United Press Sukabumi, Java, 19th] 15,000 East Indian residents marched and demonstrated in Java today. Independence leaders gave speeches, saying that Java will always remain independent. Republican President Sukarno said, "The Netherlands has begun to waver, and Dutch imperialism must collapse."

[United Press Washington, 18th] State Department spokesman McDermott declared that the dispatch of British troops to the Dutch East Indies was decided by the Joint Chiefs of Staff before the Japanese surrender. These troops are assigned to the Southeast Asia Command to assist in accepting the surrender and disarming of Japanese troops, and to protect the 100,000 civilians detained locally. The statement was issued to refute a report citing a State Department spokesman, saying that the United States should share responsibility with Britain for the current military operations against the Javanese National Army.

Dutch Statement of Position

[Reuters Batavia, 19th] A Dutch spokesman said yesterday that the Netherlands fully allows Indonesians to have the right to self-existence and free development, but the Netherlands will never accept a solution that excludes the Dutch from bearing the final responsibility for security and legality. Vice Governor Van Mook's previous statement could have served as a good basis for negotiation, but it did not receive sufficient attention. Regardless of the final resolution of political issues, the Dutch are still prepared to cooperate fully with Indonesians to solve the growing economic difficulties.

### First Session of the United Nations General Assembly - May Be Postponed - Due to the Failure of Representatives from Several Countries to Arrive in Time - U.S. House Passes Bill for Full Participation

[Reuters London, 19th] The Plenary Session of the Preparatory Committee of the United Nations unanimously agreed yesterday to hold the first meeting of the United Nations General Assembly on January 10 next year at Central Hall in Westminster.

[Central News Agency London, 18th Special Dispatch] The date of the United Nations General Assembly will be changed due to some unforeseen reasons. Two hours after the Preparatory Committee decided on January 10 next year as the opening date, U.S. Representative Stevenson (Special Assistant to the U.S. Secretary of State) requested that the date of the General Assembly be postponed to January 12 or 14, because he had just received a call from Washington stating that the Queen Mary, which would carry the representatives of the United States and Latin American countries to London, had changed its departure date from January 3 to 7, so the representatives would not be able to reach London until the 12th.

[Reuters Washington, 19th] The House of Representatives has just approved, by a vote of 344 to 15, the United States' full participation in the United Nations organization, including the provision of U.S. troops for deployment by the Security Council, etc., but the House Foreign Affairs Committee recommends that U.S. congressmen be allowed to attend the plenary sessions of the United Nations organization in a representative capacity. Therefore, the Senate must reconsider the bill before it is submitted to President Truman for signature. The bill authorizes the President, with the consent of a majority of both houses, to negotiate an agreement with the Security Council to specify the number and nature of U.S. troops that the Security Council may deploy.

### British Traitor - Amery Executed by Hanging

[Reuters London, 19th] The Evening Standard reported that John Amery, son of former Secretary of State for India Leopold Amery, was executed by hanging at Wandsworth Prison at 9:00 this morning (5:00 PM Shanghai time), and died within seconds. His father last night held a large number of letters addressed to every cabinet member, intending to use his position in the House of Commons to prolong his son's life, arguing that John's health was poor.

John pleaded guilty to all eight charges when he was tried at the Central Criminal Court last month, so the sentence was pronounced in eight minutes. This was unexpected by his family and defense lawyers, who feared that a prolonged trial would damage the family's reputation. John, who is now thirty-three years old, had already violated traffic rules seventy-four times at the age of twenty, and was declared bankrupt at the age of twenty-four, with debts of £5,081 and no assets. He himself told the bankruptcy liquidator that he had spent more than £3,000 on entertainment and travel. In 1933, John went to Shanghai as a newspaper reporter. When the war broke out, he was in the Riviera in France and was once sent to a expatriate concentration camp. After leaving the camp, he incited expatriates to join the army to fight against the Soviet Union. Later, he went to Berlin and worked for the Nazis as a broadcaster. In April 1945, when the Allied forces advanced into northern Italy, John tried to escape but failed and was captured by Italian patriots. Only a few soldiers and six civilians were present at the execution this morning. A car had been waiting outside the prison for several hours before the execution, with a man and a woman sitting in it. It is said that this was John's brother Julian Amery.

### British House of Lords Approves - Anglo-American Loan Agreement

[Reuters London, 19th] The House of Lords yesterday passed the government's motion to accept the Anglo-American Loan Agreement by a vote of 90 to 8, and also approved the Bretton Woods International Monetary Agreement. Lord Beaverbrook, who opposed the loan agreement, said in a speech before the vote that the government has bankers as its backers, and that socialists and bankers have now joined forces, so those who oppose the government's motion will inevitably fail. He does not blame the United States for the harsh conditions, saying that the United States can be described as a philanthropist, but this agreement is not suitable for the British economy, so we should thank the United States for its kindness on the one hand, and reject it on the other.

### Gales Raging Along the British and Portuguese Coasts - Worst in Five Years

[Reuters London, 19th] A gale raged across the English Channel yesterday, with wind speeds reaching seventy miles per hour, causing violent waves to batter the seawalls. Many ships took shelter outside Deal overnight. In Rottingdean near Brighton, a mine washed ashore and exploded, shaking the entire town, smashing all the windows, and causing considerable property damage. Houses in Brighton were also shaken by other mines exploding in the sea. The entire British Isles felt the power of the gale, and gale warnings along the coast remained in effect all day.

[United Press Lisbon, 18th] A storm passed through here on Wednesday, and the extent of the damage may be greater than the 1940 cyclone. Farmers are like startled birds, fearing that the Caparica volcano will erupt at the same time, and have left their homes to seek refuge. The gale has continued for thirty-six hours non-stop, blowing off roofs and sinking small boats. Giant waves crashed over the dikes and destroyed coastal houses.

### U.S. Surplus Merchant Ships - Four Thousand Five Hundred Ships - U.S. Merchants Have Right of First Refusal

[Reuters Washington, 19th] The U.S. Senate today passed a bill stating that U.S. merchants should have the right of first refusal to purchase the 4,570 U.S. surplus merchant ships. The bill has now been sent to the House Committee. The Senate recommends that U.S. foreign-going merchant ships should have at least seven million tons and at most ten million tons, compared to only three million tons before the war. The total number of merchant ships engaged in domestic and foreign trade and shipping can reach between fifteen million and twenty million tons. A reasonable waiting period should be set for the sale of surplus merchant ships to allow U.S. merchants to purchase them. Afterwards, they can be purchased by foreign merchants.

### MacArthur Reiterates Allied Occupation of Japan - Aim is to Establish a Government Suitable for Democratic Principles - So As To Restore Its Position of Being Respected Throughout the World

[Central News Agency Tokyo, 19th Special Dispatch] General MacArthur today formally reiterated the fundamental purpose of the Allied occupation of Japan, saying, "The control of Japan and its people will be exercised through the Emperor and other assistants in the Japanese government to the greatest possible extent, in accordance with the objectives set forth in the terms of surrender." Today's statement emphasized that "We are now giving a completely defeated enemy an opportunity to correct its erroneous actions, so as to restore its position of being respected throughout the world." The ultimate goals of the United Nations are (1) disarmament and demobilization, and the destruction of the authority and power of the military, so as to ensure that Japan does not again threaten global peace and security. (2) To encourage the development of the desire for individual freedom and respect for basic human rights, in order to establish a peaceful, responsible government that is as suitable for democratic principles as possible. The Japanese government and people will be given every opportunity to implement the Supreme Commander's instructions without coercion, but if they do not do so voluntarily, MacArthur will order them to comply.

Cixi

County Government Recovers Old Arrears of Land Tax

This county and other counties in eastern Zhejiang were occupied by enemy puppets and Communists for many years, resulting in the government's failure to collect land taxes for the 32nd and 33rd years. After the victory, the Executive Yuan issued a notice to all provinces and cities exempting this year's land tax and postponing the collection of old arrears of land tax for one year. Unexpectedly, the County Government recently used insufficient funds as an excuse to recover the old arrears in full, causing the people to suffer. This move is obviously disregarding the law. It is hoped that the relevant authorities will pay attention to it.

### Japanese Government Declaration: Dissolution of Parliament; Machida Appointed Party President

[United Press, Tokyo, 19th] According to official sources, both the Progressive and Liberal parties have listed the preservation of the Emperor system as the first item in their campaign platform for the upcoming general election, with issues concerning the people's livelihood and the government relegated to secondary importance. Furthermore, the Japanese government today issued a declaration dissolving the parliament, expressing hope that the results of the upcoming general election will reflect the general wishes of the people and promising to absolutely refrain from any actions that might suggest official interference in the voting. Today's dissolution of parliament marks the completion of another historic event. In 1937, General Hayashi attempted to use the parliament as a political weapon to suppress forces opposed to the military clique. Following the dissolution of parliament, the electorate will directly decide which members introduced during the era of the military clique should be purged. The importance of the Emperor issue can be seen in the continuous discussion of it in this parliament. The largest party, the Progressive Party, has elected 82-year-old veteran parliamentarian Machida as its president. If the party wins a majority of seats in the House of Representatives, he will usually be recommended as the next Prime Minister. Machida previously served as president of the Minseito (Democratic Party).

[United Press, Washington, 18th] The *Washington Evening Star* today reported that the list of Japanese war criminals to be arrested by MacArthur is gradually expanding and is approaching the Imperial family, thus increasingly shaking the position of Emperor Hirohito. If Hirohito is listed as a war criminal, he will not be able to remain on the throne.

### Chairman [Chiang Kai-shek] Delivers a Ten-Minute Speech at Nanyuan Airport in Beiping, Enthusiastically Answering Questions from Chinese and Foreign Reporters, Praising Truman's Sincere Attitude Toward China

Chairman [Chiang Kai-shek] was in Beiping for eight days, handling all matters, and everything was in order. Today (the 18th), at 10:30 AM, he informed Vice Minister Xu of the Central Propaganda Department, invited Chinese and foreign reporters, and scheduled a press conference at the Executive Headquarters at 12:00 noon. At that time, Vice Minister Xu led more than twenty Chinese and foreign reporters from Beiping to pay their respects to the Chairman at the Executive Headquarters.

Before the Speech, a Scene of Citizens Lining the Streets to Wait

When the reporters arrived, Chairman [Chiang Kai-shek] and his wife were fully prepared and ready to board their car for departure. The entire citizenry, having learned that the Chairman would be leaving Beiping, gathered along the streets from the morning, braving the biting cold wind, to see him off. Out of consideration for the citizens, and unwilling to let them stand for so long in the cold wind, the Chairman advanced his departure time to show his concern. When the reporters arrived at the Executive Headquarters, Madame Chiang and Major General Shang Zhen notified them that the press conference would be held at Nanyuan Airport. Chairman [Chiang Kai-shek], accompanied by his wife and Major General Shang and his entourage, departed from the Executive Headquarters by car at 12:00 noon. The reporters followed in their cars, exiting the East Exit of Houyuan Wusi Temple, passing through Jiaodaokou South Street, Dafosi Street, Wangfu Street, Wangfujing Street, East Chang'an Street, exiting Zhengyangmen, Yongdingmen, and arriving directly at Nanyuan Airport. From Houyuan Wusi Temple to Yongdingmen, along the entire route, citizens and students from various schools were lined up in formation, standing and waiting. As the Chairman's car passed by, the citizens waved flags and shouted "Long Live," vying for the honor of catching a glimpse of the Chairman's elegance and smile. The atmosphere was fervent, and the sound reverberated through the clouds. The Chairman, pleased and happy in the car, frequently nodded in acknowledgment.

More Than Twenty Chinese and Foreign Reporters Raise Questions for Answers

At 12:30 PM, the Chairman arrived at the airport and immediately held a press conference in the office of the Commander of the Tenth Air Force District. Chairman [Chiang Kai-shek] and his wife arrived, and Vice Minister Xu introduced the Chinese and foreign reporters. The Chairman smiled, nodded, and shook hands with each of them as a greeting. After taking his seat, more than twenty Chinese and foreign reporters surrounded him, raising questions and requesting answers.

The reporters participating this time included Zhang Mingwei, President of *Huabei Daily*; Bu Qingmao, President of *Tianjin Minguo Daily*; Cheng Shewo, President of *World Daily*; Ma Zaitian, President of *Yishi Daily*; Kong Xiaoru, President of *Ming Pao* (*Jishi Pao*); Cao Gubing, Manager of *Ta Kung Pao*; Ding Fuqin, Director of the Beiping Branch of the Central News Agency; He Xiaocun, Reporter for the Beiping News Agency; Wei Jingmeng, Director of the International Propaganda Office; and Associated Press reporters Davis Pacore, Zbiran; photographers: Gray of *Time* magazine, Wilkes of *Life* magazine, Robin of Reuters, Packard of United Press, Leiper of *New York Times*, Bruce of the United States Information Service, Major General Mykalo Bushimi of the U.S. Marine Corps News Group, and Dowling of the *Chicago Sun*, totaling more than twenty people. The speech began at 12:35 PM. Due to the Chairman's special plane being ready for takeoff, the speech time was only a little over ten minutes. The time was rushed, and it seemed that he was unable to speak freely. The following is a record of the main points of the Chairman's Q&A with the reporters:

Chairman Expresses Admiration for President Truman's Declaration

Reporter (hereinafter referred to as "Q"): What is the Chairman's opinion on President Truman's recent declaration regarding the United States' China policy? Chairman (hereinafter referred to as "A"): President Truman knows the situation in China deeply, especially he understands the current situation in China even more. His recent declaration expresses deep friendship towards China, which is truly admirable.

Q: Can President Truman's declaration promote progress in the negotiations between the National Government and the Communist Party?

A: It depends on the attitude of the Communist Party, whether they accept President Truman's opinion. I personally agree with President Truman's opinion very much.

Q: Communist Party representative Ye Jianying and his thirty entourage members have arrived in Chongqing. Will this help in resolving the Communist Party issue?

A: I only learned yesterday that they had arrived in Chongqing. I don't know their attitude and plans yet.

A Policy of Maintaining Peace and Friendship for Three Years

Q: President Truman's declaration states that both the National Government and the Communist Party should make concessions to each other, especially the government should make more concessions to the Communist Party, so that a compromise can be reached. What is the Chairman's opinion on this?

A: My consistent policy and opinion for the past three years has been to resolve the issue with the Communist Party through peaceful and friendly methods. President Truman's opinion in his declaration is exactly in line with my opinion.

The Traditional US Policy of Unchanged Relations with China

Q: Does the Chairman feel that President Truman's China policy has not changed?

A: The traditional US policy and friendship towards China have not changed. I greatly admire it.

My Government Institutions Will Be Participated in by All Factions

Q: One point in President Truman's declaration is that he hopes the Chinese government will expand its scope to include other political parties in the government. What is the Chairman's opinion?

A: In my speech at the Constitutional Implementation Promotion Association on March 1st this year, I stated that after the National Assembly convenes, people from all parties and factions will be included in the government. President Truman's declaration is exactly the same as my declaration, and Mr. Truman's opinion is also exactly my opinion.

Will Meet with Marshall on the Way Back to Chongqing

Q: Special Envoy Marshall is coming to China. Where will the Chairman meet with Marshall? When will the Chairman return to Chongqing?

A: I may be able to meet with General Marshall on the way back to Chongqing, such as in Nanjing or Hankou.

The conversation ended at 12:40 PM. The Chairman stood up and shook hands with the reporters, and especially expressed to the Chinese reporters: I am very pleased to meet the people of North China during this trip to Beiping. I am very concerned about the people of North China, and I will come here often in the future. I hope to be able to come again in two months, and I hope you will convey this meaning to the people. (Central News Agency, Beiping, 18th)

### How General Marshall Achieved Success (Translated from the *New York Herald Tribune*)

Former U.S. Army Chief of Staff General Marshall is one of the few military leaders in history to have defeated Germany and Japan in an unprecedented war. He entered the highest institution for planning operations in the United States on September 1, 1939, as Chief of Staff. At that time, the German army poured into Poland. The U.S. regular army was poorly equipped and numbered less than 200,000. The result of the military build-up has made the current strength of the U.S. military exceed eight million. During the years he stayed in Washington, D.C., to plan the strategy to defeat the enemy, he always longed to personally participate in field operations. He almost got the task of leading the Allied forces to attack Europe, but because President Roosevelt and Prime Minister Churchill believed that he was an indispensable figure in planning Allied operations, his wish was not fulfilled.

He did not come from West Point Military Academy. After serving as a cadet in the army and a football player at the Virginia Military Institute, he graduated from the Virginia Military Institute in 1901. The following year, Marshall was immediately ordered to go to the Philippines and served in the 30th Infantry Division with the rank of lieutenant. After that, he returned to China to continue his studies, and then was appointed as an instructor at the Army Military Academy and the Staff School, and then returned to the Philippines.

When he hastily prepared a plan to occupy Manila (for exercise purposes), his commander, Major General Bell, told other officers: "Gentlemen, please see that Major General Wair is the greatest military genius in the United States since Jackson."

During World War I, he wanted to participate in field operations, but his superiors greatly appreciated his talent for planning operations. Finally, he successively served as staff officer in the headquarters of the First Division of the U.S. in Europe and the First Army. He planned the occupation of Kentigny and the surrender climax of August 1918. After that, he planned and successfully implemented the most glorious battle in the last war, that is, the work of transferring 820,000 troops in two weeks to prepare for the fierce Moose Argonne offensive. He won the praise of General Pershing. After General Pershing presided over the General Staff after the end of the war, he was appointed adjutant and returned to Washington, D.C. with General Pershing. It took five years to reorganize and strengthen the California Army School. In 1936, General Craig, the then Chief of Staff, promoted him to brigadier general. Two years later, General Craig appointed him as Deputy Chief of Staff. In 1939, he jumped to Chief of Staff. Since then, he has become the mastermind behind the powerful military power of the Allies. Riding, boating, tennis, and movies are his leisure pastimes. He has never forgotten that he is an infantryman and the person who loves fighting the most.

Editorial

### Welcoming Chairman Chiang

The motherland has recovered, and it has been four months. When the good news was first announced, the whole country was ecstatic. Those who need too much often neglect each other; those who expect too much from governance are often greatly disappointed. As a result, incidents arise day by day, and chaotic phenomena grow day by day. The needs and expectations of the people are all like clouds swept away by a tornado. Small recoveries can be obtained, but the people's grievances arise in response. In fact, the source of grievances comes half from the small inadequacies of human planning and half from the inevitability of evil forces. There is an English saying called "Necessary evil." There are no precedents for things, and changes arise suddenly. Preparations are insufficient, and the scope is too large. To jointly bear the responsibility and recover from the pseudo-system, to correct and vigorously build new foundations, it is naturally impossible to have the effect of starting to work and achieving results within a month. Ordinary people do not understand political principles. Their emotions are expressed in criticism, and when criticism reaches its extreme, complaints and slanders become numerous. Today, people's hearts are unsettled, and their lives are uneasy. If one is not blind, how can one say that one has not seen it? However, when people are in dire straits, they return to their roots. In pain and suffering, they never fail to call out to their parents. Amidst various complaints and slanders, they still naturally maintain their desire to live and happily display their continuous hope, as if saying, "Although there is chaos, it is limited to a temporary period, and words are not one-sided. With this man here, what worries do we have?" There is no other reason.

How can this be made clear? Since Chairman Chiang's arrival in Beiping on the 11th of this month, the cheers of over ten million people inside and outside Yuguan have been unprecedented. Every word and deed of the Chairman, the way he speaks, whether short or long, high or low, fast or slow, is transmitted far and wide by electric waves as if measured by a meter. Those who hear it feel as if it came from his own mouth. They are so grateful that they are moved to tears. This is especially true in the nine provinces of the Northeast. The other day, the Chairman turned south and flew to the capital. Tens of thousands of people welcomed him in the suburbs, and the people of Shanghai yearned to see his face. The strength of public sentiment and the heat of popular support are no less than when his entourage was delayed in Yanjing. Among them, many people petitioned, complaining about their suffering and stating their grievances. Over a thousand cases were received. Looking back at Emperor Yao, with his clear eyes and perceptive ears, who was the center of the world's songs and lawsuits, it was no more than this. Why? As said before, the people seem to say, "With one man here, what worries do we have?" The people's feelings are so moved that it happens naturally without any effort.

However, how does the Chairman achieve this? I remember when he was trapped in Chongqing, enemy planes attacked day and night, more than ninety times a year, and the situation was precarious. A wise gentleman cried out to the crowd, "Don't be afraid! Chairman Chiang's perseverance is great, and he will definitely persevere until victory." And so it was. The significance of perseverance is so great! Zeng Wenzheng (Zeng Guofan) used to guard Qimen, a territory as small as a bullet, surrounded by enemies, with no reinforcements arriving. However, Zeng smoked his water pipe, played chess, lectured, and handled documents as usual. He once discussed the key to his success in life, and he stroked his beard and said, "What do I know? I only have a secret manual of eighteen chapters on perseverance, and I still haven't finished using it." Li Hongzhang, as a senior disciple, earnestly asked for the manual during an interval. Zeng lectured on the first chapter, which began with the meaning of the chapter. It was about an old man sending his son to the market to buy vegetables, but he didn't return for a long time. The old man was surprised and investigated, and saw his son and a porter holding each other in a ditch, unable to pass, because neither was willing to go into the water to give way. The old man pointed at the porter and said, "Come! Give me your load. I will go into the water, put it on my head, and not wet your goods. After you go over, I will carry it away again, how about that?" He spoke and bent down, making a gesture to untie his shoes. The person humbly declined, and the difficulty was resolved. This is the first chapter of the perseverance manual, a trace of government. Li Hongzhang was very pleased and asked for more. Zeng smiled and said, "If you get this, you will never use it all up, why ask for more?" Therefore, Zeng's perseverance manual was lost, and those who understand its meaning are also extremely rare. Only Chiang Kai-shek likes perseverance all his life. His use of perseverance is greatest in the eight years of bitter fighting. Recently, the people of the north and south have been displaced and complaining, and the situation is almost uncontrollable. However, the Chairman, with a light vehicle, stabilized the noisy and silenced them. Without doing anything, the tributaries and remnants of perseverance have such miraculous achievements. It is said that the Chairman admires Zeng Wenzheng, presumably the two wise men have a tacit understanding of the subtle things.

It is often said that politics is completed with assistance, and success is lost with the slightest negligence. The common people, loving and supporting Chairman Chiang as they do today, have reached the extreme. If there is no way to maintain their trace and extend their inner feelings, then the water that carries the boat can also capsize it. Today's problem is that politics comes from many sources and is becoming increasingly cumbersome. One party leader has more than three ministers, and when one thing happens, everyone is responsible, but it seems that no one is responsible. Even competing for profit and shirking responsibility in times of trouble, unknowingly falling apart, many times over. The people tell each other about these things. The expression "With one man here, what worries do we have?" will eventually be insufficient to unify the people's will and straighten the political trend.

I believe that the plan for today, to save the current situation, is nothing more than the eight characters of "following the name, verifying the reality, and ensuring rewards and punishments." I think that among the thousands of petitions, there must be cases that can be used to establish a conviction. If they are cleared up and reported to the high officials, and the original documents are fully exhausted, the world will know that this can be used to establish the scale of constitutional government in the big way, and to understand the hidden grievances of the people in the small way. In the transition, if the national affairs do not change completely and gradually reach the upper level, I would not believe it. England is called the home of constitutionalism, but in the end, there is no written constitution. In the beginning, it was derived from individual cases, summarized based on precedents, which is what is called Case Made Law. All freedom is obtained in this way, which is far deeper and clearer than empty writing and wandering without return. Today's talkers of the constitution are competing in comparison and pursuing general theories, while forgetting the important things at hand and not eagerly drawing parallels from examples and observing the general from the specific. No gentleman is more ignorant than this. In the article of welcoming Chairman Chiang, I connect and write about these things.

### Account of the Ordeal of American Pilots Captured by the Communist Army: A Harrowing 38-Day Escape to Tianjin

[United Press Agency, Tianjin, 19th] Six American airmen who crashed in a snowstorm on November 10th, about 270 miles south of Peiping (Beijing), were captured by the Communist army. After a difficult 38 days, they have escaped danger and returned here today. Although they appear somewhat worn, they are clearly healthy and unaffected. On November 10th, they were flying a "fish-when" bomber from Peiping to Tianjin when they encountered severe weather, lost their bearings, and were forced to land in a field near Heqing Village. The farmers initially ignored them after they landed, but later, several Communist soldiers arrived, pointed guns at them, and escorted them to a nearby village, where they became prisoners. Lieutenant Hall Broolk requested their release from the Communist army leader, who replied that it was a "political matter" and had to be handled through proper channels. They waited for American planes to search for them, but each time a plane flew overhead, the Communist army would try their best to hide them, preventing them from being seen.

The Communist army leader repeatedly told them that they were not prisoners. However, Lieutenant Hall Broolk retorted, "These people are sitting around us with guns pointed at us; what do you call that?" The Communist army continuously tried to indoctrinate them, attempting to propagandize these six Americans. Several times, they asked Lieutenant Hall Broolk and another airman if they would be willing to write something praising the Communist army and its leader, saying that they would treat them very well. However, both refused. They also tried to have them sit properly to take a commemorative photo, which was also rejected. Some Communist soldiers told the American airmen that American planes were attacking their villages and that the Communists and the American army were in conflict. One soldier even stated bluntly, "The Communist army is at war with the American army."

The Communist army hid the plane. Lieutenant Hall Broolk and a partner ran to the plane and tried their best to destroy the equipment on board. The partner turned on the battery, letting the current drain, and the speaker on the plane emitted a loud noise. The Communist soldiers were alarmed and held a gun to him, asking what he was doing. At the same time, Hall Broolk was in the rear of the plane, destroying everything he could, also with a gun pointed at him. Later, the six men were moved to Renqiu Village and locked in a fenced area, guarded by soldiers.

Finally, on November 25th, they decided to escape. Under the cover of darkness, they crawled out, and walked to a marshy area. That day, they walked through the fields, covering over 110 li (about 36 miles). As dusk approached, they sent two men into a village to find water and food. They found water but no food and prepared to return to where their companions were hiding to meet up. Suddenly, a group of soldiers and civilians rushed towards them. They tried their best to respond. One was hit on the shoulder with a gun butt. They fled for their lives, and the soldiers tried to stop them, firing several shots in pursuit. The four companions who were hiding saw that the two were in danger and about to be captured, so they came out to rescue them. The group of Chinese soldiers and civilians, seeing four more Americans arrive, turned around and retreated into the village.

The six men then continued walking until late at night, reaching a swampy area with crossroads, which they could not cross. Although they eventually crossed, they were spotted by the Communist army at daybreak and became prisoners again. The soldiers confiscated their wedding rings, lighters, and other personal items, but the next day, the Communist military administration returned most of the items to them. However, at night, in the grass huts, Communist soldiers would often use old-fashioned hand grenades and rifles to tap on their shins, waking them up.

On one occasion, the Communist army transported them to Xinjian Village in an ox cart and then sent them back to Heqing Village, where the Communist army treated them very well, giving them excellent food. The Communist army wanted the Americans to wear Eighteenth Route Army uniforms, but they only put on the trousers and refused to wear anything else. The Communist army leader's persistent desire for them to wear Communist uniforms was probably to make others believe that they had joined the Communist Party.

A few days later, the Communist army leader told them that they could go back. They were sent to Xinjian Village, and the Communist army retreated, saying that the Communist army was fighting the Central Army ahead. American planes had dropped some winter clothing a few days earlier, which the Communist army had collected and given to them. Everyone put on as much as they could, and the rest was given to the Communist army to repay them for the good food. This was the thirty-fifth day after their capture. They again moved toward the friendly army's front line, about 20 li (about 6 miles) from where the Central Army was located. There, two American officers were waiting for them and finally brought them back to Tianjin safely. Upon arrival in Tianjin, they were immediately examined. Although they had suffered hardship, they were fortunately unharmed. When the six men went to report to General Rockey, Rockey's face showed joy, saying, "This is the best Christmas gift I could have received."

Chairman Chiang inspects the 3rd Regiment of the U.S. Marine Amphibious Forces in Peiping. Standing beside him are General Rockey, Commander of the U.S. Marine Amphibious Forces, and General Sun Lianzhong, Commander of the 11th War Zone.

### Chairman Chiang Leaves Peiping, Citizens See Him Off

From the time Chairman Chiang arrived on the 11th until he left Peiping on the 18th, he stayed in Peiping for seven days. During this time, in addition to summoning the heads of party, government, and military organs in North China to hear reports and give instructions, he also convened briefings with responsible individuals from all sectors, received Chinese and foreign guests, addressed students, attended various gatherings, and met with local gentry, prominent figures, and representatives from all walks of life for discussions.

Lingering Sorrow, Reluctant Farewell

Chairman Chiang flew south from Peiping today. The entire city saw him off, people shoulder to shoulder, cheering along the streets, craning their necks to admire his demeanor and express their respect. All revealed a sense of lingering sorrow and reluctance to part.

Before leaving Peiping, Chairman Chiang, accompanied by Deputy Secretary-General Zheng Yanfen, inspected the Hebei Provincial Party Headquarters, the Peiping Municipal Party Headquarters, and the Peiping Branch of the Youth Corps, earnestly encouraging comrades in the party and corps to embody the spirit of labor service and work for the benefit of the people.

Applause and Flags, Enthusiastic Scene

After the inspection, from the official residence to the Nanyuan Airport, on both sides of the road, men, women, old, and young spontaneously lined up to see him off, like mountains and seas. Elders from Peiping and Tianjin, such as Jin Yunpeng, also came to the airport to bid farewell. Young students admired their leader and were reluctant to leave. Some could not help but rush out from the ranks to shake hands with the Chairman by his car to say goodbye. The sounds of cheering and applause, along with the waving of flags, created a scene of intense enthusiasm. The Chairman's smiling face and kind expression filled those welcoming him with joy. Before boarding the plane, the Chairman met with reporters at the airport, including more than twenty Chinese and foreign journalists. The Chairman went to the airport at 12:50 PM. The heads of military and government organs in Peiping, including Director Li Zongren, Commander Sun Lianzhong, Mayor Xiong Bin, and more than two hundred representatives from various sectors, all went to the airport to see him off.

Commercial News

### Gold Market Initially Weak, Then Firm; US Dollars See More Progress; Hong Kong Bills Plunge

Yesterday, the gold market saw initial weakness as short sellers continued to exert pressure. Fortunately, banks from the Sichuan group acted as pillars, gradually buying at low prices, managing to keep the 700,000 mark intact despite its precariousness. Near noon, short sellers rushed to cover, and because banks were closed today, the need to square up positions became urgent, causing a sudden depletion of available supply. There were even rumors of imminent official listing, leading to a gradual firming of the situation. Securities firms were extremely busy, and market sentiment was slightly stimulated, causing prices to rebound to 740,000 by the afternoon. Finally, prices hovered around 730,000, closing up 11,000 from the previous day. Gold jewelry was listed at 79,000, silver at 600 yuan, and silver dollars rose to around 450. Informal lending rates rose from 7% to around 10% due to a sudden increase in demand from the securities sector.

The US dollar followed the ups and downs of the gold market. Foreign trading companies aggressively bought at low prices, and major players also entered the market. From the lowest price of 1175 yuan, prices gradually rose, almost reaching 1245 yuan in the afternoon. Finally, prices hovered around 1230 yuan, closing up 20 yuan from the previous day. There were rumors that new Hong Kong bills were worth only 30% or less than old bills in Hong Kong. Factoring in an exchange rate of 85%, this was much lower than in Shanghai, causing a widespread sell-off of new bills. Later rumors that imports were prohibited in Hong Kong exacerbated the plunge. As a result, old bills closed steady, while new bills plunged 12 yuan.

### Japonica Rice Weakens; Indica and Glutinous Rice Remain Firm

In yesterday's rice market, rice from the southern gangs was still digestible, with moderate sales. Japonica rice weakened by 100-200 yuan. Indica yuan rice remained firm due to scarce arrivals and inventories. The oil market was weak in the morning but firmed in the afternoon, rising slightly by several hundred yuan. However, with price-controlled oil about to be sold, the situation is unlikely to improve. Flour and bran continued to rise by over 100 yuan due to strong demand from the Fujian and Guangdong gangs. There was a large amount of medium and lower grade miscellaneous brand flour, and merchants in this area remained slack, resulting in high prices for top quality and stagnation for lower quality. The soybean market shifted from stagnation to stability, down slightly by 100-200 yuan.

### Market Snippets

Imported paper trended upward, with sellers raising prices and strong demand from other locations, resulting in a firm market.

Raw silk prices fluctuated, with tussah silk slightly weaker. Tea trading remained stable.

North and South goods rose compared to yesterday, as Hong Kong gangs began operations in various markets. Sichuan pepper rose by 7,000 yuan.

### Large Shipments of Sugar, Gasoline, and Oranges Arrive in Shanghai

The Jiangmi, a vessel of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Shanghai-Taiwan line, sailed from Shanghai to Taiwan on the 8th of this month, arriving in Keelung at 4 PM on the 11th. After stopping for five days, it returned to Shanghai from Taiwan on the 16th, arriving in Shanghai at around 1 PM yesterday and berthing at the Jinliyuan Wharf. This shipment brought a large quantity of sugar, 7,100 bags, and gasoline, 3,110 barrels, which has already begun unloading. The ship will sail to Taiwan on its next voyage.

The Maoli vessel arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday from Haimen, Zhejiang, carrying a large shipment of Huangtai oranges, totaling over 7,000 boxes.

### Eight Government Bonds Drawn

The Ministry of Finance held a drawing for the redemption of eight types of government bonds on the 11th of this month. The bonds included the 25th Year of the Republic Consolidated Government Bond, the Ding Bond, the 27th Year of the Republic Relief Government Bond, the 30th Year of the Republic Construction Government Bond, the second issue, the 31st Year of the Republic Allied Victory Government Bond, the 32nd Year Government Bond for Consolidation of Provincial Debts, and bond classes 1, 2, 3, and 4. All winning bond tickets and matured interest coupons, except for the 25th Year of the Republic Consolidated Government Bond Ding Bond, which will continue to be handled temporarily according to the tariff-secured debt amortization method, the remaining winning bond tickets will be handled for payment by the various managing banks.

### Yarn Sales Booming

Yesterday's yarn market remained stable. Although it softened slightly in the morning due to falling gold prices, buyers flocked in and business with Beijing, Hangzhou and other locations was brisk. In the afternoon, the Sichuan and Yunnan gangs bought large quantities of 10-count yarn, making the trend increasingly stable. Prices rose by about 10,000 yuan compared to the previous day, and market sentiment remained buoyant.

### Scarcity of Raw Materials for 60-Count Yarn

The yarn mill managed by the Ministry of Economic Affairs relies entirely on old stock for the raw materials to spin 60-count cotton yarn. The raw cotton shipped by the Relief Administration is also cotton that has been stored for four or five years, and lacks tensile strength making it difficult to spin 60 count yarn.

### Coal Market Strong; Charcoal Shows Signs of Improvement

The coal market saw continued real sales of white coal, and the market atmosphere was strong. Industrialists purchased lump bituminous coal, slightly supporting the prices, but sales of bituminous coal dust to factories were quiet and the trend remained mediocre. Retail sales of charcoal were active, showing signs of a turnaround, as current market prices have fallen to production area prices. Several ships of Jiangxi charcoal from Haimen arrived in Shanghai yesterday, resembling Huangyan Jiangxi charcoal. The transaction price was 5,000 yuan per load.

### Category C Bonds Break 800; Securities Market Hot; Both Chinese and Foreign Stocks Rise

The bond market continued its momentum from the previous day. Speculators aggressively sold off, causing Category C bonds to fall from 700 yuan to below 650 yuan. Small banks worked hard to absorb the selling, providing support. Industry insiders gradually obtained external assistance and opportunistically re-entered the market, pushing prices back up to over 700 yuan. Subsequently, Chinese and foreign stocks rose sharply amid recovery talk, bolstering the buying momentum. Major players acted decisively, pushing prices up significantly. By noon, prices broke through the 800 yuan mark, closing at the highest price. The results showed a sharp rise of 40 yuan to over 100 yuan compared to the previous close. Miscellaneous brands did not keep up due to the late hour, but after the noon close, the momentum was overwhelming, continuing to rise in the commotion.

Chinese stocks initially weakened but then became popular. Although some sold off, major players continued to aggressively absorb at low prices, and banks joined in. With the multi-party lineup strengthened, industry insiders seized the opportunity to push up prices and were stimulated by the rising momentum of foreign stocks. Those who had not acquired foreign stocks rushed to buy Chinese stocks, resulting in many closing at peak prices. Compared to the previous close, Yong Yarn rose 75 yuan, Maya 90 yuan, Xin Guang 3 yuan, Jing Fu 3 yuan, and Qin Xing 2.5 yuan. Cold market giants such as the Commercial Press were in high demand with no supply, and buyers were very active after the close, with bidding continuing to increase.

The momentum of foreign stocks was overwhelming. Securities firms, money houses, and investors eagerly absorbed, creating a buying frenzy. Supply was extremely limited, resulting in too few loaves for too many people. In addition, there were various rumors that the industry association was resuming operations and that foreign factories could apply the same workaround of foreign banks that first resumed operations and then registered. This led to the long-awaited resolution of the transfer issue and because the bottom prices of the depressed foreign stocks were very attractive, buyers competed to offer high prices, hoping to secure their purchases. As a result, the market was dominated by buyers, with a further increase of over 10% compared to the previous close.

### A Comparison of the New and Old Company Laws for Limited Companies

– Nai Sheng

To adapt to modern economic trends, the National Government has revised and re-issued the Company Law. The current Company Law has many differences from the previous Company Law. Shanghai is the commercial center of the country, and merchants must pay close attention to the Company Law. I will only list the differences between the new and old Company Laws in the most important part, the chapter on Limited Companies, as follows:

1. Establishment: The old Company Law stipulated that a limited company should have seven or more promoters. The current new law stipulates that five or more are sufficient. The new law also allows foreigners, whether residing in China or not, to participate in Chinese companies.

2. Shares: The old Company Law stipulated that the capital of a limited company should be divided into shares, with the amount of each share being uniform and not less than 20 yuan. The new law has no such minimum amount requirement. The old law allowed a company to issue bearer shares, but the number of shares could not exceed one-third of the total number of shares. The new law stipulates that bearer shares can be issued up to one-half. The old law only allowed the issuance of one type of stock when a company was established, unless for capital increase or when issuing company bonds, at which point preference shares could be created. However, in the new law, preference shares and common shares can be issued simultaneously when the company is first established.

3. Shareholders' Meeting: The old Company Law stipulated that each shareholder of a company had one vote per share. If a shareholder had more than 11 shares, the articles of association should restrict their voting rights, but the total voting rights of each shareholder, including the voting rights exercised on behalf of other shareholders, could not exceed one-fifth of the voting rights of all shareholders. However, in the new law, unless otherwise stipulated in the articles of association, there is no such provision.

4. Directors: The old Company Law stipulated that a company should have at least five directors, elected by the shareholders' meeting from among the shareholders. The new law reduces this to three, but one-half of the directors must reside in China. If the board of directors has a chairman, the chairman must be a Chinese citizen residing in China.

5. Managers: The old Company Law did not have detailed provisions for managers. The new law stipulates that the appointment and dismissal of managers and deputy managers must be decided by a majority of the directors, and the same method is used for their remuneration. The new law also has clear provisions for the responsibilities and powers of managers.

6. Company Bonds: The old Company Law stipulated that the total amount of company bonds issued by a company could not exceed the total amount of paid-up capital. If the company's existing assets were less than the total amount of paid-up capital, it could not exceed the amount of existing assets. The new law stipulates that company bonds cannot exceed the total amount of the company's assets remaining after deducting liabilities.

7. Capital Increase: The old Company Law stipulated that when a company raised new shares, old shareholders should be given priority to subscribe. If there was a surplus, it could then be raised from others. The new law still follows this, but the new shares subscribed by old shareholders should not exceed the original proportion in principle. For example, if someone holds one-fifth of the shares in a company, then when the company increases its capital, the new shares subscribed by that person should not exceed one-fifth.

8. Dissolution: The old Company Law stipulated that the dissolution of a company must be approved by more than half of the shareholders representing more than half of the total number of shares, with the consent of more than two-thirds of the voting rights of the shareholders present. The new law requires the attendance of shareholders representing three-quarters of the shares.

The above eight points are relatively obvious differences. In the current Company Law, there is also a special difference from the old law, which is the provision for the management of foreign companies in China. During this post-war construction period, China needs a huge amount of foreign capital, and allied nations are also willing to invest in China. Therefore, the current Company Law has a special article to manage this matter, which was not found in the old Company Law.

### Chongqing University Students Petition: Eager to Return Home, Requesting Financial Assistance; Ministry of Education Responds Earnestly, Willing to Act as Students' Nanny

[Chongqing Aviation News] Over seven hundred students from National Chongqing University, recently entrusted by student associations from eight wartime universities, including National Major University, Sichuan University, Yunnan University, Guizhou University, Guiyang Medical College, Guiyang Normal College, Guangxi University, and Sichuan Provincial College of Education, to assist in returning home for continued studies,

### Petition from Eight Universities

formed a group and arrived in Chongqing at 9:00 AM on the 14th, representing the eight universities to petition the Ministry of Education. They also issued a letter to the public stating: "With the victory of the War of Resistance, we are eager to return home. We urge the Ministry of Education to allocate us to volunteer universities for continued study as soon as possible, and request the same treatment as students from universities relocated inland, so that we can currently focus on our studies with peace of mind." Reportedly, these universities had already made this request three months ago, urging the Ministry of Education to make proper arrangements. Furthermore, representatives were sent to the Ministry of Education again the night before to petition, but without any indication of progress. Therefore, on the morning of the 14th, a group of seven hundred students gathered and marched from Shapingba into the city to petition the Ministry of Education, requesting three points:

### Requesting Three Points

(1) To be allocated to desired schools, corresponding departments, and grades for continued study. (2) To be provided with convenient transportation and travel expenses. (3) To have the allocation matters completed before March of next year. All the students gathered at the Sichuan Normal College playground, and after several twists and turns, Vice Minister Hang Liwu finally addressed the students earnestly around 7:00 PM, stating briefly: "The desire of wartime students to return home to study is human nature. The Ministry of Education has already made a decision in principle, and detailed measures are also being drafted. The Ministry of Education is like the students' nanny, and all reasonable matters will be properly handled."

### Response from the Ministry of Education

The Ministry then responded with three points: (1) All students who relocated from the war zone due to the war will be regarded as wartime students. (2) The Ministry of Education will be responsible for financially assisting impoverished wartime students to return home. (3) After returning home, they will be provided with convenient transfer opportunities, and will definitely not be allowed to drop out of school. In the end, after answering students' inquiries, all students expressed satisfaction and shouted, "We trust our nanny, Vice Minister Hang!" Everyone applauded in unison. However, after Vice Minister Hang left, a portion of the students insisted on not returning to school. Subsequently, a vote was held with 259 votes against and 232 votes in favor of returning to school. Afterwards, the university president Zhang Hongyuan, dean of the School of Business Zhu Guozhang, and others persuaded them. Around 9:30 PM, the Ministry of Education dispatched eight special transportation vehicles to transport all the students back to Shapingba in two trips. (Yun)

### Shanghai Disaster-Stricken Schools; Appeal to the Political Participation Council for Assistance in Allocating Enemy Property Houses

[This City News] The Shanghai Private Disaster-Stricken Schools Federation, due to the destruction of school buildings, held a joint meeting at the Patriotic Girls' High School a few days ago to discuss everything. In addition to applying to the municipal authorities for relief, they also jointly sent a letter to the Chairman of the Political Participation Council, requesting that a proposal be submitted to allocate enemy property houses or funds for repairs. The application schools are listed as follows:

### Applying Schools

Sun Yuan, Principal of Shanghai Private Patriotic Girls' High School; Yu Ziyu, Principal of Southeast Women's Physical Education Normal School and Affiliated High School; Wang Peisun, Principal of Nanyang Middle School; Mei Songxian, Principal of Mingzong Girls' High School; Lu Jizeng (Acting), President of Daxia University; Xu Songshi, Principal of Chongde Girls' High School; Wang Zhen, Principal of Chengzhong Middle School; Chen Hongbi, Principal of Guangdong Elementary and Middle School; He Shizhen, Principal of Chizhi College and Affiliated High School; Wang Xinkang, Principal of Qingxin Middle School; Zhang Rongzhen, Principal of Qingxin Girls' High School; Zhou Huiyi, Principal of Xinmin Middle School; Yan Zhenyu, Principal of Yuqing Middle School; Chen Qide, Principal of Mellon Middle School. The original letter was addressed to Zhang Boling, Chairman of the Political Participation Council, and Wang Yunwu and Wang Yong, and the gist is as follows:

### Letter to the Political Participation Council

During the eight years of the War of Resistance, more than half of Shanghai's cultural institutions were destroyed by the Japanese invaders. The original school buildings of our schools were mostly located in Jiangwan, Zhabei, and Nanshi, etc., all of which were often impacted by artillery fire, either completely destroyed, partially damaged, or although the houses remained, doors, windows, tables, chairs, books, and instruments were all looted. Now that the War of Resistance has been won, everything is waiting to be rebuilt. Education is the foundation of the country, and the country should be built before the country is built. Therefore, our schools have separately applied to the Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau, requesting the allocation of enemy property houses, or funds for repairs, and jointly submitted to the Executive Yuan Ministry of Education, temporarily requesting a loan from the National Bank for restoration and repair, and enrichment of equipment, etc., 10,000,000 yuan per school. This loan will be supplemented and returned from the Japanese war reparations in the future. So far, none of them have been approved. Our schools can't help but worry about it, so on the 6th of this month, we held a joint meeting of Shanghai Private Disaster-Stricken Schools at Patriotic Girls' High School, and decided to send a letter to the Political Participation Council to submit a discussion and provide assistance. Sincerely, because the Political Participation Council is a public opinion organ, and you and other executives are also the Chairman of the Political Participation Council, you have always been familiar with the pain and embrace it, and care about education. Therefore, we especially urge you to submit the above two items requested by Min School and others to the General Assembly for discussion as soon as possible, that is, one is to allocate enemy property houses for all those completely destroyed to fill the school buildings, and the other is to temporarily borrow from the National Bank for restoration and repair and enrichment of equipment, etc., 10,000,000 yuan per school, and approve it, and inform the Executive Yuan Ministry of Education, and the Shanghai Municipal Government to handle it, so that our schools can return to the classics as soon as possible, and we can't help but wait for orders.

All take off their hats and salute the national flag with attention. If wearing a uniform, they should salute with a raised hand. Two duty students take one step forward, and raise the flag or lower the flag with the signal. When the music is finished, the duty students step back one step, and the duty class leader issues the "At Ease" command, and all are at ease. (7) After the ceremony is completed, the chairman and the duty students retreat first, the duty class leader issues the "Attention" command, followed by the "Dismiss" command, and all disband in order.

### Method

### National Reconstruction Education

— Yang Chunlu

If we do not deny that education should adapt to the needs of the country and assume the mission of the times, then future education should move towards the path of national reconstruction. During the War of Resistance, we worked hard on wartime education (or called emergency education, national crisis education, national defense education, national education, ...), which contributed to the victory of the War of Resistance. After the victory, we should always devote ourselves to national reconstruction education in order to achieve the greatest goal of national reconstruction.

How should national reconstruction education be implemented? It can be started from the following points:

(1) Simultaneous Advancement of School Education and Social Education. At present, there are not only many school-age children out of school in my country, but also more illiterate adults. If these illiteracy are not eliminated, the construction of the country cannot be realized. To eliminate illiteracy, it is of course necessary to popularize education, add as many schools as possible, force children to go to school, and at the same time establish mass schools to implement adult remedial education. In this way, taking care of both children and adults, and advancing school education and social education simultaneously, can be effective.

(2) Balance Knowledge Imparting and Physical Training. In the past, education only focused on the transmission of knowledge and neglected physical health, resulting in a group of weak scholars. In the future, the implementation of national education should always strive for the sound development of children's physical and mental health, so that the balance and coordination of knowledge and strength can be achieved.

(2) Combining Production Skills and Scientific Knowledge. Based on the principle of children's physical health, implement production labor, and study social and natural science from production labor. In this way, the skills obtained are productive, and the knowledge is scientific. Improve production skills with scientific knowledge, and promote scientific exploration from production work.

(4) Connecting Group Training and Moral Cultivation. National education must pay attention to the organization and application ability of group activities, so that children can cultivate their individual morality from the group. On the one hand, it can develop good character, and on the other hand, it can develop the ability to participate in political organizations as adults.

### Chairman Cares for Students; Provides Free Food

[Central News Agency Beiping, 18th Dispatch] The Chairman cares very much for the students in Beiping. Because the students living in Beiping's universities and middle schools are from other counties, transportation is blocked, economic sources are cut off, and food cannot be maintained, Director Li of the Garrison Headquarters had previously approved the food department special commissioner to issue one month's food to the students living in each school at a price. However, the central government stipulates that because the recovered areas are exempt from land tax, the food for all agencies and schools should be purchased by themselves, and if it is allocated, it must also be paid. When the Chairman arrived in Beiping, in order to take care of the students' food difficulties, he specially approved the free allocation of miscellaneous grains for relief. After receiving the order, the food department special commissioner immediately notified each school to prepare a register to receive the food. The allocation was roughly completed on the 17th and 18th. The students of each school are deeply grateful for the Chairman's loving virtue.

The "Minquan" vessel of the Minsheng Company ran aground. In the morning (the 17th), it left the port at the same time as the "Jiangshun" vessel, heading for Yichang. On that day, because the wind was strong, the "Jiangshun" vessel, being large, was not affected and continued upstream. The "Minquan" vessel was small and did not dare to rush forward. At around 12:00 midnight (the 18th), near Nantong, due to unfamiliarity with the river channel, it sailed into shallow water and ran aground. It immediately telegraphed Shanghai to report the situation. On the 18th at noon, during high tide, the vessel could be moved, but unexpectedly ran aground again after the water receded. The company has prepared a tugboat, which will go this morning to tow it. On the one hand, it is hoped that the vessel will leave the shallow water on its own.

Although most of them have been transferred to the Management Group of the Enemy and Puppet Assets Administration, that group is only responsible for safekeeping. It is now known that the bureau has begun to hear cases of traitors, so it has specifically transferred all the files of traitors' real estate to the Assets of Traitors Group for continued management.

### Director Chen of the Land Administration Bureau Discusses the Significance of Land Registration; Fees Collected in Accordance with Central Government Regulations

In order to carry out land registration by the Shanghai Municipal Land Administration Bureau and the Central Government's regulations on the collection of deed tax fees, and to enable all sectors of the city to fully understand the general work situation of the bureau, it invited accountants, lawyers, real estate developers, newspaper reporters, and more than 200 other people to a tea party on the afternoon of the day before yesterday (the 18th). Director Chen Shiquan personally presided over the meeting, stating:

"I am very honored to have everyone here today. The Land Administration Bureau has been working for nearly three months since it began its work. Regarding land matters and the points that citizens should pay attention to, I would like to give everyone a comprehensive report. I hope that everyone present will give us your unreserved advice. During the eight years of the Anti-Japanese War, the city's land administration was illegally disposed of by the enemy and puppet regime. Land registration was disordered, deeds were lost, and property rights became problematic. In particular, the properties of Allied nationals and many British and French registration deeds were changed to the eighth day registration. After the recovery, the bureau reorganized them in accordance with the land right clearing methods promulgated by the Central Government and established three major work guidelines: (1) to proceed with the handling in a peaceful and fair manner; (2) to handle legal property rights in the former concession areas in accordance with the central government's regulations; and (3) to adjust the distorted land rights disputes of Allied nationals in a fair position in accordance with reciprocal treaties.

Launch Land Surveying and Registration

As for all unregistered single slips and old deeds in Huangpu District (i.e., the former Public Concession Engineering Bureau and the French Concession Bureau), which are of great age, the bureau has dispatched 22 surveying staff teams to survey and map in detail. It was found that there are often discrepancies in the mu divisions in the deeds, so land surveying and mapping registration is extremely important. There are two meanings of this land registration: (1) In terms of the people, after applying for registration according to law, a land ownership certificate is issued, and the people's rights have absolute validity and are guaranteed. Moreover, the property certificate is also attached with a detailed map, which is very convenient for the owner. (2) In terms of the government, there are complete registers. After the entire registration, the investigation is convenient, which is of great benefit to the promotion of land administration.

The Chairman announced to the people on the Double Tenth Festival, one of which is land surveying and wealth registration. Therefore, land registration is a necessary procedure for investigating wealth, which is a kind of wealth registration and should be accelerated.

Registration Area Divided into Three Locations

As for the scope of registration, it is divided into three registration offices. The six districts are registered first, including Huangpu District (including the old Public Concession area and the old French Concession area), Zhabei District, Yinxiang District, Caojing District, Hunan District, and Fahua District. For the convenience of general owners, in addition to the General Bureau, three registration sub-bureaus are established: (1) No. 66 Zhapu Road, the first registration office, handles registration matters in the old Special First District (Huangpu), Zhabei, and Yinxiang Districts; (2) No. 71 Daxi Road, the second registration office, handles registration matters in the old Special Second District (Huangpu) Fahua District; (3) No. 72 Shangwen Road, Nanshi, the third registration office, handles registration matters in Hunan and Caojing Districts.

I hope that citizens will actively go to register. Because the first registration is more complicated, in order to seek detailed information, two months are given for registration and receipt, that is, from November 19th to January 18th. On average, there are 220,000 mu of land in the six districts, with at least 300,000 households. After the registration is closed, another two months will be given for the announcement period, so that when others have objections after the owner registers, they can be corrected according to law. During the announcement period, registration can also be handled with flexibility, but a late registration fee must be paid. Owners who live in other places and cannot rush to register can state their normal reasons and be allowed to make up for the registration. If the land practice certificate issued 26 years ago has no disputes, they can come to the bureau to exchange it, so as to simplify and expedite the process. In short, unless there are special circumstances, it will be handled as soon as possible. Please don't doubt it, this is a necessary process, I want to declare this.

Certificates Issued by the Enemy and Puppet Regime are Invalid

All land rights registrations made by enemy and puppet organizations during the fall of this city and the land rights certificates issued by them are invalid; however, if the public freely buys and sells, if it is a legitimate transaction, the property certificate is still considered valid. If coercive behavior is used, the government will fully protect the legitimate rights and interests of the people.

Foreign merchants' road changes to Japanese, or transfers and sales, shall be protected in accordance with the law and corrected and returned. As for Chinese citizens who have their own property certificates and foreign merchants who have powers of attorney, the Bureau will implement land ownership registration in accordance with the central government's laws and regulations for all land consolidation matters, treating Chinese and foreign nationals equally, and the land ownership certificates will be valid and will be issued by the Tian Bureau in succession.

Regarding the exchange of land ownership certificates, they will be returned to the owner after the owner applies for registration with the registration office. At present, the measurement of all six districts in the first phase has been mostly completed, and the transfer of changes is relatively easy. The time for the first registration outside the six districts may not be enough, and a notice will be issued after the six districts have been handled. However, people can still go to the General Bureau to handle transfers and changes at any time. If property certificates outside the six districts are lost, they can apply to the General Bureau at any time. Cases of unclear boundaries will also be cleared and re-mapped in order.

Handling Enemy and Puppet Use of Land

Land used by the enemy and puppet regime, such as land in Jiangwan, Dachang, Wusong, Longhua, and other areas, that was forcibly occupied without payment of compensation, and that is not actually needed by our central government, can be fairly returned. All past folk farms, etc., will be returned as much as possible. I have talked with the Shanghai Enemy and Puppet Property Handling Bureau about this matter, and it can be done. Regarding registration fees, Jiangsu Province used to be responsible for collecting measurement fees in the past in the field tax, but field tax is not responsible; however, the cost of printing in the country is quite large. At this time of financial difficulty, I hope that citizens will assist for their own property rights. As for the fee standard, those who apply for the first land ownership certificate registration will be charged 4/1000 of the declared land price, and those who apply for land rights acquisition, setting, transfer, change, and cancellation registration will be charged 2/1000 of the right value. The contract tax is relatively high, from 6% to 15%. This income belongs to the national treasury and is collected and remitted by the bureau on behalf of the treasury. According to the general principles of the Land Law, it is not necessary to pay deed tax after land consolidation and registration. This point is also very important, and I hope that all sectors will pay attention to it.

Freely Declare Registered Land Prices

The bureau hopes that owners will not declare the land price too low when declaring land value-added tax. If there is no sale after five years, it will be re-evaluated. This value-added tax is a natural trend of urban prosperity and is not obtained by people's labor, that is, it also contains the meaning of equal land rights. Therefore, the government taxes it quite highly. If the declared land price is 2 million per mu now, and the land price increases to 3 million after 15 years, that is, the land price increases by 50%, the government will levy a value-added tax of 20%. Therefore, if the land owner declares a low land price, the land price will rise sharply after 15 years, and the tax will be higher, which is a loss. On the contrary, if the selling price of the real estate exceeds the declared value, tax must also be levied, but the value-added tax fee shall be borne by the buyer. It is hoped that the owners can freely declare the value of the land at the level line. At the same time, the Bureau also adopts the land price register occupied by the Public Works Bureau and the puppet organization in the 30th year as reference material.

It was found that the various registration offices handled land registration not more than 200 households per office per day last month, and it is estimated that there are 300,000 households, which seems too slow. It is hoped that the owners will register as soon as possible and do not hold on to wait and see. In short, the Bureau is actively serving the people in an extremely complex manner. The people can view and copy volumes at the Bureau for free, and all registration offices will give them the greatest convenience. If there are inquiries, they will answer them as much as possible. If the boundaries are unclear, and measurement is required, if the staff's attitude is bad, or if there is corruption, the people can report and report it; once verified, they will be severely punished. If you have any good ideas, you can say them orally or in writing, and I am very willing to accept them," he said.

Subsequently, representatives from all walks of life successively raised questions about registration security and taxation. Director Chen answered them one by one, and the discussion was very lively. It did not end until 6:00 p.m.

### Factories That Moved to Sichuan Hold a Meeting in Shanghai; Appeal to the Government for Relief

(Our newspaper) The Shanghai office of the United Association of Factories Moved to Sichuan and Guangxi held a meeting at its office on East Seward Road at 3:00 p.m. yesterday, inviting 62 member units of the association to Shanghai to attend the meeting, and invited envoys Ye and Niu to attend and make a request. Envoy Ye did not arrive due to official business, but Envoy Niu Tixing arrived accompanied by Xue Mingjian, a representative of the association and a senator. More than 70 people attended, including representatives of the association's units in Shanghai, Liu Hongsheng, Yan Yaoqiu, Zhou Jinshui, and reporters from various newspapers. The atmosphere at the meeting was generous and warm, and from the speeches of the representatives, we can further understand the current situation of the factories in the inland. Here is a brief record of what happened:

Seven Requests

First, Yan Yaoqiu, Chairman of the Association, put forward seven requests to Envoy Niu, hoping that they could be forwarded to the central government. The contents were: (1) To allocate enemy and puppet factories quickly to facilitate production; (2) To implement low-interest loans; (3) To advance compensation to help resume work, because the factories that moved inland during the war suffered extremely heavy losses. For example, the Huacheng Electric Appliance Factory lost 890,000 yuan in legal currency during the Xianggui War last year. Although this loss can be claimed from the enemy in the future, the government should first advance a part of this compensation to help with turnover and encourage loyalty. (4) To exempt taxes for one year, as in the case of farmers who are exempt from field tax for one year. (5) To assist technical workers in the rear to come to Shanghai to resume work, because the black market ticket price from Chongqing to Shanghai has been sold at a frightening price of 400,000 yuan in legal currency. Technical workers cannot come. (6) Some of the machines in the inland factories can still be used. Please help the government with transportation. (7) Please improve the factory administration and protect the peaceful workers. The request was signed by members of the Association in Shanghai and submitted to Envoy Niu in writing.

Difficulties of Factories

Then, the members expressed their opinions separately, and the words of Zhou Jinshui of Huacheng Electric Appliance Factory were the most painful, moving the whole venue. Zhou said that when Hua or moved inland from Shanghai, there were more than 1,000 tons of machines. During the Xianggui War, only 875 tons were left. After reaching Liuzhou, the QianGui Road was blocked and there was no way to transport them. 22 workers died and 6 were missing. As for the remaining materials, they had to destroy them themselves and ask the Allied forces to bomb them. After Zhou and his party traveled to Chongqing, the Ministry of Economic Affairs lent them 75 million yuan, instructing them to resume work. Unexpectedly, after resuming work, victory came, and the government no longer ordered goods from the factories. The factories had to stop work, and Huacheng was no exception. The total loss reached 890,000 yuan in legal currency. He personally went bankrupt and could not repay the government's debt, and the interest on the government's debt reached 3 minutes and 4 cents. If this continues, he will be imprisoned for debt. His only hope is "Please distinguish between those who love the country and those who do not." Wu Gengmei said that when the factories moved inland, they never considered success or failure. He also said that the exchange rate had not been set, and how could the bidding price be set? Their hope was to be able to manage the enemy and puppet factories on behalf of the government. Liu Hongsheng also said that the bidding method only provides Shanghai merchants who make a fortune from national disasters with new opportunities to make a fortune. He also said that factories in Shanghai have been closed for three months, 200,000 workers have lost their jobs, and the losses are huge.

Niu's Statement

Envoy Niu then stood up to express his sympathy, saying that because victory came suddenly, everything was very hasty, and there were not enough people, so there were inevitable facts that were not satisfactory. "The people's losses are not exhausted, and the government's pain is also not exhausted." The government not only wants to recover the hearts of the people, but also wants to know the people's suffering, and wants everyone to speak freely, so that in the future, in addition to the constitutional draft, it can also formulate political programs and policies. He also asked everyone to submit written proposals as "certificates" for the envoy's report. Finally, Xue Mingjian said, "The people will never compete with the country for profits, but the government must also be clear." The meeting ended at 6:00 p.m.

### International Radio Station Transmits and Receives; Direct Telegraphs Between China and France

According to transportation sources, the International Radio Station of the Ministry of Transportation has resumed operations in Shanghai. It has successively opened direct international wireless circuits with China and the United States, China and the United Kingdom, China and Switzerland, Shanghai and Hong Kong, and Shanghai and Macao, as well as news circuits between China and the United States and China and the Philippines. In order to facilitate communication between China and France, the station has added a direct international wireless circuit between China and France from the 19th of this month. It uses high-speed automatic machines day and night to communicate with Paris, the capital of France, and is extremely smooth. All sectors can send telegrams directly to the business office of the International Radio Station at No. 70 Fuzhou Road.

### New Exchange Rate to Be Determined; Still Under Study

[Our Newspaper] Our reporter visited a responsible official of the Central Bank yesterday to inquire about the rumor that the exchange rate would be announced soon. It is said that the new exchange rate should not be too low, so as not to affect domestic industry and commerce, but it should not be too high. Moreover, the new exchange rate must take into account the domestic economic situation, the issuance of banknotes in various places, the price situation, and the economic trends of various countries in the world. Only after comprehensive investigation and research can a final decision be made. He firmly believes that the responsible authorities of the government are actively studying it. The reason for the delay in the announcement is also sufficient proof that the problem is too complicated, and a new exchange rate that takes into account all aspects cannot be determined without careful study, comprehensive planning, and delimitation.

### Post-War Relief and Rehabilitation Governor Sets Up News Committee

[Our newspaper] The United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, the Executive Yuan's Post-War Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, and the Shanghai Branch, in view of the fact that the news released by each agency sometimes has unclear boundaries and technical aspects that are not perfect, have decided to establish a joint news committee to coordinate news releases. Meetings are held twice every Wednesday and Saturday. The committee has three members: the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration has appointed Mark Alusituo, the Executive Yuan's Post-War Relief and Rehabilitation Administration has appointed Shen Weitai, and the Shanghai Branch has appointed Wang Renyi. Shen Weitai will serve as the chairman of the committee, and Gu Liang, the chief of the news section of the Shanghai Branch, will serve as the secretary of the committee concurrently.

### Murderer of American Pilot, Kaburaki, Escorted to Shanghai

Kaburaki Masao, the first war criminal who murdered an American pilot and former Chief of Staff of the 34th Army of Japan, is scheduled to be extradited here from Tokyo today.

MacArthur's Nephew Responsible for Escorting

Lieutenant MacArthur, the nephew of General MacArthur, is responsible for escorting the criminal to Shanghai. Lieutenant MacArthur is also a staff member of the War Crimes Trial Committee here. He went to Tokyo on the 17th and will return with instructions from General MacArthur for use as a reference in the trial of war criminals.

### Non-Main Roads in This City Will Be Renamed

According to a responsible person in the municipal government, after the main roads' names have been rectified, the municipal public works bureau is considering the rectification of the names of the branch roads. During the puppet organization era, the road names that were rectified were quite unreasonable. This last rectification of the road names will be announced before the end of this year.

### Japanese Murder Case Cracked; Murderer Yoshisaka Caught

A case of a Japanese man killing our compatriot Chen Shunsheng was cracked in the Hongkou District of this city the night before last. The murderer, Yoshisaka Yukitomo, a Kumamoto native (34 years old), has been captured. He will be transferred by the North Sichuan Road Police Station to the Procuratorate of the Shanghai Local Court for investigation and prosecution. The victim, Chen Shunsheng (54 years old, from Pudong, a carpenter of the former "China Central Water and Electricity Company," residing at No. 42, Lane 304, Dongjiaxing Road), was fatally struck in the head with a pickaxe by Yoshisaka on the morning of August 8. His son then filed a complaint with the police station to arrest the murderer. The murderer, Yoshisaka Yukitomo, moved repeatedly, and the search was fruitless. It was not until the week before last that he was found to be hiding under the name Sasaki. At 9:30 the night before last, personnel from the Japanese Overseas Chinese Management Office, together with military police and the victim's son Chen Sigeng, went to capture Yoshisaka Yukitomo and detain him.

### Local Association Tea Party to Welcome Hong Lanyou

The Shanghai Local Association held a tea party at the association at 3:00 p.m. yesterday to welcome Hong Lanyou, Vice Minister of the Ministry of Social Affairs. Due to poor health, President Du Yuesheng commissioned Wang Xiaolai to represent him. After the chairman delivered a welcoming speech, Vice Minister Hong stood up to give instructions, and Wang Xiaolai gave a speech of thanks before the meeting was adjourned.

### Wireless Registration Deadline Extended

[Our newspaper] The registration of wireless, wireless stations, and wireless equipment in this city, which was announced by the Songhu Garrison Command to expire at the end of this month, has been extended because the Telecommunications Supervision Section of the Department is too small and the workload is insufficient. The deadline will be determined after a new location is found.

### Transportation Vehicles Arrive in Shanghai; $2,000 USD Per Vehicle

[Our newspaper] The Post-War Relief and Rehabilitation Administration transported 250 transportation vehicles yesterday, and the installation can begin immediately. Once completed, they can be purchased by various transportation companies. It is said that they will be sold at the original price of the vehicles, which is $2,000 USD per vehicle. Although an application must be submitted first, after investigation, it can be approved only if it is found to be truly beneficial to transportation.

### Robbery on Daji Road, Nanshi

[Our newspaper] Five thugs, all armed with handguns, suddenly came to the home of Sun Linshu at No. 2 Yongqingli, Daji Road, Nanshi, at 4:30 p.m. yesterday. They robbed him of 1.5 million yuan in legal currency and fled with the stolen goods. Afterwards, the principal reported to the Penglai Branch Bureau in charge for self-arrest.

### Commander of U.S. Air Force, Hackingberger, Returned to the United States Yesterday; All Work of the Tenth Air Force Completed

General Hackingberger, commander of the Tenth Air Force, known as the "Wilderness Air Force," left here yesterday to return to the United States. All the work of the Tenth Air Force has also been completed. Before the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, General Hackingberger flew from California to Hawaii in the United States, making a non-stop flight, setting a new epoch in aviation history. After the Pearl Harbor Incident, he served in the Pacific and fought to the death with the Japanese in the air. In early 1945, he came to China and first served as the Chief of Staff of General Chennault, Commander of the Fourteenth Air Force, and later succeeded General Davidson as the Commander of the Tenth Air Force. This Air Force fought in the India-Burma theater. After the end of the war, it made great contributions to the work of the Chinese Air Force in transporting troops to various recovery areas. It air-transported 81,000 of our troops and 712 units to the Dongjiu provinces, coastal areas, and Vietnam and other recovery areas in 49 days. At the same time, it air-transported a portion of the U.S. military back to the United States.

### City Police Department: Several Criminals Arrested

In recent days, several robbery cases have occurred in this city. The police department has been conducting rigorous investigations. As a result, in addition to the Taishan Road Branch quickly solving a major case, the Criminal Division of the General Bureau has also solved two cases in recent days. One involved the arrest of Zhou Xuelong and eight others inside the Imperial Palace Hotel on Zhejiang Road, along with a batch of weapons. These criminals have a long history of offenses. According to their confession, they have repeatedly robbed Mr. Jin at No. 9 Huimin Road, Mr. Xu at No. 149 Yuezhou Road, and five other locations. The other case involved the arrest of four criminals, including Shen Fenghao, at the intersection of Shanxi Road and Tianjin Road. They confessed to robbing ships carrying longans and soybeans on the Huangpu River. Furthermore, the Water Police Branch also arrested eight criminals, including Huang Yuanyi, for robbing ships on the Huangpu River, along with numerous weapons and stolen goods. The investigation is currently ongoing.

### Postal Service with Japan and Korea Temporarily Suspended

(Our Newspaper's Report) Regarding the resumption of postal services with Japan and Korea, which concerns international laws, our country's postal authorities have submitted a request to the Ministry of Transportation for instructions. Yesterday, an order was received stating that since our country is at war with Japan and has severed diplomatic relations, postal services with Japan should not be resumed. The troops of the United States and the Soviet Union are currently occupying the northern and southern parts of Korea, and transportation has not yet been restored. Before the situation becomes clearer, it is difficult to resume postal services. The matter should be reconsidered after military liaison officers and diplomatic specialists are sent to Korea, and when the opportunity for resuming postal services arises.

### Zhang Wei Arrives in Shanghai from Chongqing to Inspect Sanitary Conditions

Zhang Wei, Director of the Health Committee of the Executive Yuan's Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, arrived in Shanghai from Chongqing yesterday to specifically promote sanitation work in the city. Zhang's first step will be to inspect the sanitation conditions of various hospitals and charitable organizations in Shanghai, as well as the supply of medicines.

### Unified Freight Rates and Fares to Be Implemented Tomorrow

The Shanghai Shipping Industry Association Reorganization Committee, established on the 16th of last month, has formulated interim regulations for the reorganization of the association, as well as a work plan consisting of seventeen essential points. It has begun the process of receiving and reorganizing all public funds, assets, deeds, and other files of the original association and the puppet association, and registering members. More than half of the 50+ privately-owned shipping companies in the city have already joined. The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company remains a member. After a certain period, qualifications will be reviewed, and registration certificates will be issued upon approval from the Bureau of Social Affairs. Furthermore, for the study of important issues and military transport, the committee has formed five subcommittees: (1) Industry Cooperation Committee, chaired by Yang Guanbei, to study joint operations, joint procurement of materials, and other issues related to industry cooperation. (2) Rate Committee, chaired by Hu Shiyuan, to study and stipulate standards for freight and passenger rates and vessel charter prices, and to negotiate freight rates for various routes. (3) Shipping Document Unification Committee, chaired by Wei Wenda, to study and design the unification of or clauses for shipping orders, bills of lading, manifests, storage receipts, passenger tickets, charter contracts, and other documents, and to formulate standard freight and passenger procedures and charts. (4) Accounting Unification Committee, chaired by Li Yunliang, to study and design a unified accounting system for the shipping industry, including accounting subjects and bookkeeping procedures. (5) Shipwreck Compensation Committee, chaired by Qian Xinzhi, to investigate shipwreck losses and seek government compensation for various matters. The Rate Committee, for the purpose of unifying freight rates and fares, has already negotiated various price lists, originally scheduled to be implemented on New Year's Day next year. It is now learned that the freight rates and passenger ticket prices of various companies are extremely chaotic, which greatly hinders the shipping industry. Therefore, it has been decided to advance the implementation to tomorrow (the 21st), and the price lists have been distributed to various companies, which must adhere to the association's fixed prices and are not allowed to increase or decrease them arbitrarily.

### British Red Cross Society Holds Christmas Party for Children

British News Agency reports that the British Red Cross Society is holding several Christmas parties to entertain children under the age of fourteen who have been released from detention camps in the Shanghai area. The first party was held yesterday at the Riverside Apartments. The second party will be held on the 21st of this month. The third and fourth parties will be held on the 22nd at Lincoln Road and the British Refugee Camp. Children from Britain, Belgium, and the Netherlands have received invitations. All children attending the party will receive gifts, and the society is making every effort to ensure that these children have the best possible Christmas party.

### City Briefs

The City Defense Corps convened its first corps affairs meeting at the corps headquarters at 2:00 PM yesterday, resolving multiple important cases. It is reported that they have decided to prioritize the deployment of veteran members for duty, tentatively from 7:00 PM to 1:00 AM the next day, to assist the military and police in maintaining public order. If necessary, the duty hours can be extended to 6:00 AM the next day.

The Shanghai Branch of the Chinese National Diplomacy Association sent a telegram to General Marshall, the newly appointed U.S. Special Envoy to China, yesterday, expressing their welcome.

It is learned that the entire amount has been properly allocated, and the 15 branch offices of the Administration and the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry of the Executive Yuan will receive a considerable amount. They will soon be transported to various places using ships, railways, trucks, and other means of transportation, with the essential items for emergency relief in various places being shipped out first.

### A Glimpse into the Lives of Detained Nazi Party Members: A Visit to the German Refugee Camp

— Mai Tian

Walking along Qimei Road in Jiangwan, you will forget the tall buildings you saw twenty minutes ago, as well as the crowded and chaotic scene on the streets. Qimei Road is lined with wide fields on both sides, with no houses, no stalls, and few people. In the distance, you can see a huge white building on the left, which is now the German refugee camp. It used to be a Japanese national elementary school. Four connected buildings, one of which is now home to two hundred followers of Hitler.

Among the two hundred German refugees detained, there are eighty-nine men, forty-eight women, and sixty-three children. They have formed their own committee, organized by five people, responsible for their own food, clothing, shelter, and other aspects of life. The chairman, Lundao, is a key figure in the minds of the Nazi Party and used to be a consultant to the German Consulate.

There are approximately 2,300 Germans in Shanghai. The German Refugee Management Committee has divided them into three categories: (1) government personnel, including diplomats, propaganda personnel, and important Nazi Party members; (2) business personnel, including foreign company employees and technicians; and (3) residents, including priests, ministers, doctors, lawyers, and other self-employed individuals and residents. Those currently held in the refugee camp belong to the first category and those in the second and third categories who were devoted to the Nazis or engaged in activities detrimental to the United Nations during the enemy puppet era. The remaining Germans are instructed to obtain guarantees before temporarily staying in the city. The German Refugee Management Committee has reached an agreement with Yangshupu Sacred Heart Hospital and will soon order another two hundred Germans with relatively difficult living conditions to be concentrated there.

As for the Germans' property, houses, and furniture, some of it has been signed by the German property owners, lessees, and the German Refugee Management Committee and supplied to the municipal government agencies for use.

Stubborn Old Nazis

On the construction site of the refugee camp, the Germans funded the construction of a kitchen, which they reportedly spent hundreds of thousands of legal tender on over a month ago. It is quite spacious. At four o'clock, they were already preparing dinner. About ten German men and women were sitting in a circle peeling potatoes. Among them was an old man wearing a peaked cap and leather jacket, tall and large, who was Ramen, the leader of the Nazis in the Chinese region. This old fox, who had been influenced by Hitler's ideology for many years, was very stubborn and unwilling to casually tell reporters anything. When the reporter asked about his family, he said, "I have no family." Besides Ramen, there were several other Nazi figures who were once prominent, such as Erhardt, the former Nazi leader in Shanghai; Minato, a former professor at St. John's University; Cord, the former leader of the German intelligence group in Shanghai; Mostis, the former president of the Shanghai Haitong News Agency; Taussad, the former president of Baolong Hospital; and Hebert, an important member of the former German Embassy. Twenty-one classrooms of the former Japanese elementary school on the second floor have now been designated for them to live in. Each room is divided into several rooms, and each family has an area of two zhang long and one zhang wide, enclosed by cloth to form a small room. The furnishings inside are quite comfortable, with two small beds, two children's beds, and some furniture, so it is not too crowded. It is said that they are well organized and eat together. Each person spends five US dollars per month on food. They do their own laundry and clean their rooms. Several German men also took axes and were chopping tree roots on the lawn. They have no organized entertainment and at most play chess. They are required to get up at 7:00 every day, have breakfast at 8:00, roll call at 9:00, lunch at 12:00, dinner at 6:00, another roll call at 7:00, and go to bed at 9:00. They are not allowed to leave the room after 9:00. Gambling, quarreling, and making trouble are prohibited. The German Refugee Management Committee is responsible for the roll call. All men must sign at the office, while women and children are temporarily exempt from the roll call.

Innocent Children

Regarding medical care, German dentist Beckland and Dr. Haimen visit twice a week for treatment.

The German Refugee Management Committee currently has seven people managing everything in the camp, and the Garrison Headquarters has sent twenty guards to defend it.

Although these Nazi Party members have lost their freedom, considering their crimes, they believe that the treatment in the camp is very good. It is incomparable to the inhumane "dens of devils" of the Axis powers.

Before leaving the camp, I saw several German children playing in the courtyard. Two extremely adorable little girls were sitting on a stone sill, smiling innocently at us. I thought they might feel confused about being suddenly sent to such a desolate place, losing their interesting toys and lively places to go. Would they know whose gift it was? I feel wronged for those children.

The Japanese National Elementary School on Qimei Road has now been used as a refugee camp for the German refugees. These followers of Hitler and implementers of Nazism, although they have lost their freedom, are still living a daily life above the middle class. The detained German men are working in the courtyard, looking energetic, comfortable, and leisurely.

### Seeds of Several Thousand Years Sprout

— Yang Tongfang

Recently, it was reported that the "Archaeological Expedition" engaged in excavation work in the Chyor Lake District and Vologda Oblast of the Soviet Union discovered four ramie seeds on the Molodna River. After careful examination by many experts, it was proven that they had been buried underground for several thousand years and have only recently sprouted and branched. Soviet scientists will try to cultivate new seeds from these seeds.

This seems like a scientific miracle. Seeds from thousands of years ago, buried underground, can sprout and branch out today, thousands of years later. After such a long era, the strata have undergone countless changes, but the seeds that were originally sown have not been submerged by the ancient years. I think that the person who originally planted the seeds, even his bones may have long rotted into soil. How could he have imagined that they would be discovered by archaeologists thousands of years later?

The great British thinker Spencer once said, "A pebble can change the earth." This means that one should not underestimate the minuteness of a pebble, because a pebble is always a kind of "matter," and "matter," whether large or small, can change the world. The physicist's so-called "conservation of matter" also illustrates that any kind of "matter" can produce various changes in the space it occupies, and these changes will have various different impacts on our world and humanity. Looking at the importance of atoms and electrons in today's human life, it is not difficult to understand the principle of "conservation of matter."

Seeds of several thousand years can sprout and branch out. According to the comprehensive research of botanists and chemists from the Soviet Academy of Sciences, it is not a cosmic miracle. In the past, many scholars have studied this issue, and the conclusion is that it is 73.6% possible. Future research may increase the percentage of possibility. Furthermore, using the principle of "conservation of matter" to explain it, the seeds planted thousands of years ago will of course try their best to sprout and branch out in the years to come, although thousands of years is a very long era that may sometimes surprise us.

From this fact, we can derive two great inspirations: one is that we humans in this vast world should not underestimate the power of our individual selves. Although individual power is small, it can affect the entire world and involve all of humanity. This is a fact. The seed that was originally sown, after undergoing several years of changes and evolution in the strata, can be left to future generations for the cultivation of new seeds. At the same time, it can allow people to trace back to a desolate era in ancient times and generate the two concepts and feelings that "history is evolving" and "historical development is cumulative." I think that some revolutionary ideas initially disseminated by a revolutionary, even if they are only bits and pieces, will eventually merge into the mainstream of the revolution. Tracing back to the revolutionary ideas disseminated by the predecessors, we feel that they have immortal achievements. Even if the impact was very small at the time, society is actually changing imperceptibly because of it, just like seeds of several thousand years slowly growing underground.

A person lives in the world for only a few decades. The survival and continuity of the "small self" must rely on the power of the "big self." In other words, we do not live for ourselves, but for society and for all of humanity. If we want to hope that the "small self" is immortal, we can only expand the "small self" into the "big self." We should think more for others and not only care about our own interests. We should contribute as much power as we have. We must do our best to do things that benefit others, and our work attitude must transcend "selfishness" and not care about future rewards or seek praise from others. We must adhere to the concept of "do one thing for every ounce of strength, and give one ounce of light for every ounce of heat." If we cannot do a grand and earth-shattering undertaking, we should also learn from the sower of several thousand years ago, sowing seeds and leaving them for future generations to cultivate new seeds, continuing forever without interruption, and giving scientists some valuable research data. Our ancient China has always had a popular saying, "The predecessors plant the trees, and the descendants enjoy the shade," which is very correct when said positively. Unfortunately, this sentence has long become a kind of irony, teaching people to be "clever," teaching people to "not interfere," and teaching people to "only plan for themselves." If this bad attitude towards life is not eliminated as soon as possible, even if individuals live in the world for hundreds or thousands of years, they will still rot with their own corpses. If we want to hope that our "spirit" does not rot with our corpses, we should expand the "small self" view of life into the "big self" view of life.

The second inspiration is: history is a mirror, and no one can violate the rules of history. You reap what you sow. The law of cause and effect does not allow people to reverse it casually. Berkeley said, "See a world in a grain of sand." Although sand is minute, its impact and changes on creating a world are certain and unchangeable. The evil consequences suffered by the two invading leaders in the East and West eight years ago are precisely due to the "evil causes" they created. They no longer dare to do evil in the face of justice. They have already bowed their heads in front of the mirror of history. This is the condemnation and punishment they deserve.

As mentioned earlier, we should not underestimate the power of our individual selves. Although our power is small, expanding from the "small self" to the "big self" is enough to influence our world. At the same time, we must cherish the fact that every one of our actions can have a great impact on future generations and society. Mr. Hu Shih said in an article that a person accidentally spat on the road, and this sputum contained countless tuberculosis germs, which spread and infected all the residents of the city with tuberculosis. This sounds unlikely, but it is actually very possible. If the four seeds recently discovered in the Soviet Union can be slowly cultivated into new seeds, then the reproduction rate of ramie will never decrease. Our nation, in the process of nation-building, also needs countless people to transcend the concept of "selfishness" and sow the seeds of shining the light and heat of the nation for future generations. Decades later, hundreds of years later, thousands of years later, our descendants can enjoy endless happiness, which would be so meaningful!

### Mr. Xu Zhen, Chairman of Liaoning

— Xuetao

Due to the improvement of the situation in the Northeast, Mr. Xu Zhen, the chairman of the Liaoning provincial government sent by the central government to take over Liaoning, also took a plane north a few days ago.

Among the senior officials sent to take over the Northeast, Mr. Xu Zhen, the chairman of the provincial government, is also one of the youngest, besides the diplomatic specialist Mr. Jiang Jingguo. He is only in his early forties this year, but he has already shouldered the heavy responsibility of being the head of a province. This is also a rare achievement among the provincial chairmen across the country.

Speaking of this Mr. Xu Zhen, I think everyone will not be very unfamiliar with him, because he served as the administrative inspector of the Sixth District of Zhejiang, and was later promoted to the director of education of the neighboring province of Fujian. Since Japan's surrender, he has jumped to become the chairman of Liaoning Province. In these short years, he has been promoted from commissioner to director, and from director to provincial chairman, which can be described as a "meteoric rise" of a popular figure. However, there is absolutely no chance of luck in this, because this kind of leapfrog promotion is not something that people who are eager for advancement can hope to achieve. If you don't believe it, let's take a look at a period of his history:

Mr. Xu is a native of Shenyang, Liaoning. In the 20th year of the Republic of China (1931), he was still serving as the director of the municipal telegraph bureau in Harbin. When the "September 18th" Incident broke out, most of the large and small institutions in the Northeast were lost. Some officials were arrested and imprisoned, and some supervisors took the opportunity to abscond. The chaos was truly heartbreaking. But our director of the municipal telegraph bureau, Mr. Xu Zhen, took 200,000 yuan of public funds and traveled to Nanjing, where he met with Minister Zhu Jiahua and explained all the public accounts clearly. Minister Zhu believed that in the chaotic situation and the shallow worldly atmosphere, it was rare to find such an upright gentleman, so he took him to meet with Chairman Chiang, who gave him encouragement. Later, he was appointed as the administrative inspector of the Sixth District of Zhejiang. The Sixth District was Chairman Chiang's hometown. During his eight years in office, the people praised his benevolent rule. In the 31st year of the Republic of China (1942), he was transferred to the director of education of Fujian, and made many achievements in education in the province of Min, especially the national language unification movement, which achieved great results. Recently, the central government appointed Mr. Xu as the chairman of the Liaoning Provincial Government because the Northeast was recovered—this is Mr. Xu's political experience.

From this brief history, you can imagine what kind of honest, self-disciplined, and hardworking official Mr. Xu is. Compared with those officials who are only busy making national crisis money and enjoying the blessings of victory, they are of course not comparable. It is appropriate that the central government specially appointed Mr. Xu as the new administrative officer for the recovery of the Northeast.

Mr. Xu Zhen is a Northeasterner who escaped from the "September 18th" era ten years ago. Now, he is being sent back to recover the lost territory, which is the most suitable candidate. We hope that Mr. Xu will not only recover the lost land of the Northeast for us, but more importantly, recover the hearts of the people of the Northeast for us!

### American War Dog Team

— Tingjun

During this World War, the American army fully utilized war dogs. These dogs saved countless soldiers and achieved glorious feats.

In 1943 alone, the U.S. Army Quartermaster Corps trained more than 40,000 carefully selected war dogs. There were five training locations. Before training, each dog's personality and strengths were tested. Then, they were trained according to the work they were suited for. Among all the war dogs, 85 percent belonged to scout and attack dog teams, specially trained to detect concealed enemies and launch fierce attacks. Additionally, there were communication war dogs, who had to cross dense electrical grids to transmit messages and military maps to the rear. Patrol war dogs were tasked with patrolling the front lines or detecting concealed enemy troops when annihilating surrounded enemy forces. Rescue war dogs were tasked with finding wounded soldiers and reporting to the rear, so the rear could quickly dispatch people for rescue. Transport war dogs were tasked with using carts to transport military firearms and equipment to the front lines inaccessible to people. There were also supply war dogs, tasked with delivering water and food utensils through dangerous areas to various points on the front lines.

During training, military dogs prepared for combat received various enemy attack training. Upon seeing an enemy, they would pounce fiercely. Only military dogs serving in rescue and communication did not receive attack training. Rescue dogs carried a specially made leather stick on their collars. After discovering a wounded soldier, they would hold the stick in their mouths and run back to the rear. Upon seeing this signal, the rear would immediately dispatch a rescue team to follow them and find the wounded soldier.

Each war dog had a trainer specifically responsible for it, training it in various skills and responsible for feeding and caring for it. The first requirement for a war dog was to obey its master's orders. With one gesture, it would immediately rush towards the enemy, disregarding its own safety. With another command, it would immediately curl up on the ground, without moving at all.

The basic training period for war dogs was usually eight weeks. After training, some remained in the country to guard armories or military fortresses and patrol coastal areas, while most were transported overseas and assigned to various front lines for combat. The U.S. military called them the K-9 Corps, a military dog force.

These war dogs also achieved many accomplishments in various places. For example, a war dog guarding a certain armory in Boston discovered a spy trying to steal secrets and immediately held the spy down, refusing to let go until the guards arrived and arrested the spy. The spy was found with the entire plan to destroy the factory. During the landing in Sicily, a soldier advancing with a war dog was besieged by machine gun fire on the shore. In the midst of the crisis, the war dog suddenly rushed into the machine gun position. After a fierce battle, the machine gunner was bitten to death, and the other soldiers surrendered together. During the North African campaign, one night, a sentry was guarding with a war dog. The war dog suddenly tugged on the rope held by the sentry, and the sentry immediately notified the second line of sentries a few hundred yards away. This sentry hurriedly woke up the sleeping soldiers and repelled the sneak attack by the enemy. The war dog was able to detect enemy movements from 800 yards away. During the campaigns in the Southwest Pacific islands, the tropical areas were densely forested, and the swamps were hidden, making it even more difficult to spot enemy traces. They relied entirely on war dogs to save many soldiers and detect the Japanese army's hiding places. Their tactics indeed established indelible achievements.

Most war dogs were donated to the military by their owners. After they died in action, the Department of the Army had printed notifications sent to the dog owners: "Your war dog donated to this unit –––, has unfortunately died in action. May you find solace in remembering its heroic sacrifice for the country and slightly reduce your sorrow." Many war dogs died for their country. Recently, the American Legion has resolved to request the government to open public cemeteries and bury the war dogs who died in action in various units with military honors.

### Post-Mortem Birth

— Shen Yikun

On December 8th, in Rockford, Illinois, USA, a full-term pregnant woman died of polio. Her baby was delivered thirteen minutes after her death. The child is a girl, is still alive, and is healthy.

Doctors say that although this baby girl's birth is very rare, she still has a chance to survive.

This little girl was delivered by Army Medical Corps Colonel Kerns. He said: "She is healthy and should develop and grow normally unless she contracts polio."

The baby girl weighs four pounds and fourteen ounces.

### Moving Houses

— Baihua

An American engineering expert specializing in moving houses said: "If you want to move, but you can't bear to part with your current house, you can move with your house. Just install beams in the lower layer of the house, lift it up with a crane, put it on a vehicle, and with a turn of the wheels, the house will be moved away."

However, this type of house moving is not suitable for small buildings. It is best to move hospitals, churches, office buildings, and apartments, etc. Moving these large buildings from their old foundations to new foundations takes six months to a year.

In Aberdeen, South Dakota, USA, there is a Lincoln Hospital that was moved to a new site one and a half miles away. This hospital is four stories high, 115 feet long, and 42 feet wide, with a net weight of 300 tons. The construction cost was $150,000, and moving it to the new site in the suburbs cost $75,000 – that is to say, half the money was saved.

There is a four-story apartment building that was moved back 20 feet because the street was being widened. All the tenants continued to live inside during the move.

Public buildings are often moved to save taxpayers' money. The Dearborn Observatory of Northwestern University in Illinois was moved several hundred yards away, except for the telescope lenses. Most of the valuable instruments remained intact. Moving buildings can save money and preserve the traditional atmosphere of the buildings.

Architecture

### Suspended Roofs

— Xingju

American architects have recently devised a way to build a suspended roof, made of aluminum, using the principle of air pressure, without the need for pillars to support it, stably suspended in the air.

In the future, when you watch a ball game or listen to music, when you look up, you may see this kind of roof, gleaming brightly in the air. You don't have to be afraid, it won't fall down; it's held up by air, which is stronger than any steel pillar.

The roof is made of extremely thin aluminum sheets, and the edges around it are tightly connected to the walls. Inside the arena, many fans in the basement "inflate" the air, increasing the air pressure. You may feel strange: how can relying on air pressure alone make the roof suspended in the air without falling down? Because the aluminum sheet roof weighs only one and a half pounds per square foot, the air pressure inside the arena only needs to be 0.05 pounds per square inch more than the outside to stably hold the roof up. And people will not feel uncomfortable in that kind of air pressure, which is no different from the air pressure when the sun reappears after a heavy rain.

According to the architect's precise estimate, this kind of suspended roof will not collapse even in the event of a very severe storm. Using this smooth roof, the acoustics can be harmonized, the lighting can be improved, and what is most satisfactory is that because there are no ordinary pillars to support it, the audience can have unobstructed views, and leaving the arena can also reduce congestion.

### On Lung Disease Without Worry (3)

China Health Care Association

(4) Conditioning and Nourishing are Palliative Treatments

(7) When to Conduct X-ray Examinations

All patients with progressive or open lung disease may have no symptoms of lung disease and no suffering, such as someone's brother, whose lung disease is already critical, and someone is also infected, but all his actions are as normal, with only some phlegm. After the brother's death, someone underwent X-ray photography, and both lungs were infiltrated and incurable. There are also a couple, the husband is ill, and the wife serves him for many years. At first, she does not feel sick. One day, the wife suddenly coughs up blood. After X-ray examination, there is a cavity in the lung. There are countless examples of this kind. Therefore, to prevent lung disease, X-ray examinations should be performed as early as possible, so as not to be destroyed by tuberculosis bacteria without knowing it. So when should X-ray examinations be performed? According to Dr. White Downing,

(A) Anyone suspected of having lung disease, regardless of whether they have pain or what the symptoms are, should undergo X-ray examination. (B) Anyone with respiratory disease that has not healed for more than three weeks should undergo X-ray examination. (C) Anyone who has frequently had respiratory diseases in recent years should undergo X-ray examination. (D) When doctors treat patients, if they belong to respiratory diseases, they should also use X-ray examination in addition to treatment.

In summary, we can draw a conclusion that it is wrong to immediately determine that the lungs are healthy without X-ray examination. In other words, lung health cannot be determined without X-ray examination. Therefore, to perform an accurate diagnosis of lung health, X-ray examination is essential, and X-ray photography is the most appropriate. Anyone who looks healthy but already has lung disease, or who has respiratory disease and is suspected of having lung disease, should be examined with X-rays immediately. This is of great importance to their personal health and the prevention and eradication of lung disease. It is hoped that people from all walks of life will promote it as much as possible, so as to achieve the great effect of eradicating tuberculosis.
