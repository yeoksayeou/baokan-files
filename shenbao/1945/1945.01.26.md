Philippine Front, Japanese Army Base, 25th (Central News Agency Telegram) – The Japanese Air Force is currently fighting fiercely on Leyte Island, echoing the brave battles of the Japanese soldiers. From January 1st to the 22nd, they have repeatedly attacked enemy airfields on Leyte and Mindoro Islands, setting fire to 21 locations at Tacloban Airfield, one location at Talak Airfield, three locations at Tanoman Airfield, and four locations at the North San Jose Airfield.

From a Japanese Base in the Philippines, 25th (Central News Agency Telegram) – On the evening of the 24th, the Japanese Air Force fiercely attacked a transport convoy sailing in the Mindoro Sea, inflicting considerable losses.

Japanese Army Base in the Philippines, 25th (Central News Agency Telegram) – Since the enemy landed in Lingayen Gulf, the state of enemy aircraft raids on Luzon Island has been as follows: On the first day, there were a total of 300 to 400 aircraft. Subsequently, the types of aircraft gradually became mixed, and the numbers also gradually increased. The main enemy aircraft included the large B24, the medium P38, and the small P47. Other medium aircraft included the B25A and (maybe B26A), and small aircraft included the P51 and P40. Simultaneously, carrier-based aircraft also participated. Their composition varied daily. On the 23rd, there were a total of 263 aircraft, including five large aircraft, 170 medium aircraft, and 88 small aircraft. On the 24th, there were a total of 405 aircraft, including 122 large aircraft, 224 medium aircraft, and 59 small aircraft. The bases for these enemy aircraft are the airfields on Morotai, Leyte, and Mindoro. Departure times are approximately 2:30 AM to 4:00 AM for Morotai, 7:00 AM to 10:00 AM for Leyte, and 8:00 AM to 9:00 AM for Mindoro. Raids occur once in the morning, with formations of about 20 aircraft or so, attacking in detachments. However, when approaching mobile units, carrier-based aircraft carry out attacks to cut off Japanese transportation routes and hinder the construction of Japanese positions. They also engage in guerrilla warfare with a few aircraft, even invading in the afternoon. The main force of enemy aircraft is cooperating with the land battles in the Lingayen area, using shorter-range fighters. Recently, they have started using airfields landed in Lingayen Bay as bases, engaging actively.

Japanese Troops Fighting Valiantly on Luzon Island

Philippine Front Base, 25th (Central News Agency Telegram) – Enemy forces in the southeast coastal area of Lingayen Gulf have suffered heavy losses from brave Japanese attacks. However, superior enemy forces repeatedly attacked Japanese positions around Rosario with powerful mobile units on the 22nd, firing over 6,000 shells daily since then. Conversely, Japanese troops fought bravely, charging into enemy lines, completely foiling enemy attack attempts. On the 21st and 22nd, Japanese troops killed or wounded over 400 enemy soldiers in the area, destroyed over 34 enemy tanks, and shattered or captured many other artillery pieces. On the 21st, the enemy landed a portion of their forces near Santo Barbara. Enemy forces on the front line of San Fabian also shelled the Japanese first-line positions. A portion of the enemy eventually seized a corner of the Japanese first-line position. Japanese troops are still bravely counterattacking. Enemy flanking units at Villasis encircled a portion of the Japanese positions in the southern Villasis area. These Japanese troops are also fighting fiercely.

Tokyo, 25th (Central News Agency Telegram) – The battle situation on Luzon Island is as follows: The battle situation on the high ground east of the Pangasinan Plain remains largely unchanged. Japanese troops north of Mabiga are currently adopting a defensive posture. Furthermore, enemy forces that bypassed the first-line positions and infiltrated deep into Solibao have gradually become passive due to four weeks of fierce Japanese attacks. The enemy strength in this area includes approximately three divisions of the First Army Corps of engineers. The main force of the enemy landing force includes one division of the Fourteenth Army Corps, which is moving south from the Lingayen-Dagupan area. Around the 15th, they reached the Agno River basin, and one unit crossed the river southward. Around the 20th, they appear to have entered the central Luzon Plain, reaching Tarlac and La Paz, about ten kilometers east of it. Within the northwestern tip of Lingayen Gulf, near Bolinao and Alaminos to the southeast, approximately twenty kilometers northwest of Lingayen, a portion of the enemy troops appear to have landed. As for the total enemy strength on Luzon Island, it includes five strong divisions: the 6th, 25th, 4th, and 13th Divisions of the First Army, along with the 158th Regiment, and the 27th and 40th Divisions of the Fourteenth Army Corps, along with a portion of the Marines. Enemy transport convoys are still traveling to and from Lingayen Gulf. On the 20th, there were twenty transport ships. On the 21st, there were several ships. On the 23rd, a considerable number of transport ships entered the harbor.

### Ba Maw's Statement: Refutes British Draft

Rangoon, 24th (Central News Agency Telegram) – At the end of last year, the British government issued a draft regarding the handling of Burma, revealing their treacherous scheme to oppress weak nations. The Burmese people were outraged upon hearing this. On the 23rd, Burmese national representative Ba Maw met with a delegation of Japanese, Burmese, and Indian news reporters, strongly refuting the draft and issuing the following statement: After the British draft was released, the Burmese people became extremely angry. Monks and youths alike unanimously requested the government to participate in the war to defend the homeland. Now, in response to the people's wishes, the government is exerting all its strength to cooperate in the war and is adopting wartime emergency measures. Therefore, youth organizations will soon implement a conscription system, and labor organizations will also conduct labor registration. The national will to fight is completely contrary to what the British are propagating, and is even more intense than during the expulsion of British forces in 1942. As for the plan in the draft to place Burma under military control for a period of time, the so-called "reconstruction of Burma" is entirely a British ploy to suppress the Burmese people. The constitution being formulated is merely a means of deceiving the Burmese people. Burma will never be deceived by British rhetoric. Although Britain claims that the Japanese military's presence in Burma is the sole target of their attacks, the Japanese military's true goal is to defend Burmese territory. The British are engaging in actual invasion plans, fabricating various pretexts. According to a monk who escaped from British-occupied territory in northern Burma, there is no respect for human rights or international law in British-occupied areas. This kind of politics is purely exploitative. Therefore, the British political policy is evident.

### Japanese House of Representatives to Hold Subcommittee Meetings Tomorrow; Provisional Military Expenses Included in Budget

In addition, the supplementary budget for special accounting expenses is 15,560,000,000 yen, bringing the total to 116,690,000,000 yen. This represents an increase of 32,800,000,000 yen compared to the budget for the 19th fiscal year.

Army Minister Reports on Soldiers' Valiant Fighting

Tokyo, 25th (Central News Agency Telegram) – During the general budget committee of the Japanese House of Representatives on the 24th, Mr. Akira Koyama questioned the current situation of the Japanese soldiers fighting actively on the islands behind enemy lines. Army Minister Sugiyama replied as follows: Although 30-40% of the army soldiers on the South Pacific islands have died, they have not been defeated and are not wavering. In particular, since the Guadalcanal operation, the Japanese units fighting in various parts of the South Pacific have continued to fight bravely on isolated islands. They are determined to serve the country to the last man. In the recent Battle of Peleliu, despite being subjected to superior enemy air attacks, the Japanese army continued to fight bravely. This is the spirit of the Japanese soldiers. All members have a special attack spirit and are determined to repay the country with unwavering combat to the last man.

Minister of Agriculture Declares to Secure Rice Rations

Tokyo, 25th (Central News Agency Telegram) – Minister of Agriculture and Commerce Shimada stated at the general budget committee of the House of Representatives on the morning of the 25th: The current standard amount of rice rations will be absolutely secured and will never be reduced in the future.

Tokyo, 25th (Central News Agency Telegram) – During the general budget committee of the House of Representatives on the morning of the 25th, Mr. Nobufusa Miyoshi raised a question. Minister of Agriculture and Commerce Shimada replied: The goal for potato production this year is to double it to 189,000,000,000 kin (a traditional Japanese unit of weight, approximately 600 metric tons).

### Air Battle Over Palembang Area, Sumatra; Over 78 Enemy Aircraft Shot Down

Tokyo, 25th (Central News Agency Telegram) – The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced on the 25th: On the morning of January 24th, approximately 120 enemy carrier-based aircraft attacked the Palembang area of Sumatra. The local Japanese air force and ground forces intercepted them, shooting down over 78 enemy aircraft. Fourteen Japanese aircraft did not return. Damage to ground facilities was minor.

### Comprehensive Japanese Military Results in the Irrawaddy River Basin

Rangoon, 25th (Central News Agency Telegram) – The Japanese forces in Burma have been bravely fighting the strong Chinese-American forces for days. From December 1st to January 15th, the main comprehensive battle results in the Irrawaddy River basin are roughly as follows: 1,404 dead Chinese-American soldiers left behind, 1,509 captured, 6,940 wounded or killed, 12 tanks lost, and 91 vehicles lost. In addition, the Japanese army captured many artillery pieces and firearms.

### Chinese-American Air Force Bases to be Thoroughly Destroyed

Nanjing, 25th (Central News Agency Telegram) – The Chinese-American Air Force stationed in Chongqing has recently been carrying out indiscriminate and aimless bombing of peaceful areas, causing deep resentment and hatred among the people, who are becoming more determined to fight the enemy. According to their propaganda, the bombing targets of the Chinese-American Air Force are mainly so-called military facilities. However, their actions violate what they proclaim. They disregard Chinese civilians, carry out indiscriminate bombings, and show no selectivity. Since the Japanese army launched its continental operations last year, most of their air bases have been lost. In addition, their recent defeats in the Pacific have exacerbated their indiscriminate bombing. The American military is trying to use the results of blindly bombing our compatriots to conceal the fact of their defeat. Their intentions are very clear. However, most of their air bases in Chongqing have been lost, and their strength has been greatly reduced. If there had been no continental offensive last year, their active strength would be even lower today. The Japanese army now knows for sure that Chengdu is their bomber base and that Zhijiang, Liangshan, and Laohekou are their fighter bases. Therefore, preparations have been made to thoroughly destroy them in the shortest possible time. Apart from the air force, there are many rumors about ground forces stationed in Chongqing. However, the actual situation cannot be known for sure. When the Japanese army attacked Guilin last year, it was rumored that enemy American ground forces were cooperating in the fighting, but the Japanese army never encountered them. Therefore, according to the observation of a certain military expert, even if the enemy has ground forces stationed in Chongqing, their strength is only about two or three divisions. It is still doubtful whether they are all American soldiers or whether Chinese soldiers are mixed in. However, the Yunnan Expeditionary Force, which Chongqing currently claims to have stationed in Yunnan, is indeed completely Americanized.

### Acting Chairman Chen Visits Suzhou to Inspect; Inquires About the People's Livelihood in Various Places

Suzhou, 25th (Central News Agency Telegram) – Acting Chairman Chen of the National Government, along with Propaganda Minister Zhao Shukong, Army Minister Ye Peng, and Minister of Social Welfare Ding Mocun, arrived in Suzhou by special train at 11:00 AM on the 14th to inspect. Upon arrival, Governor Ren personally welcomed them at the station and escorted them to the Governor's residence to rest. Governor Ren reported on the progress of government affairs since taking office, as well as the recent situation of in-kind tax collection and public security in various places, and the measures to improve education in Jiangsu Province. Acting Chairman Chen listened attentively and expressed his extreme satisfaction. He then indicated that the central government would provide full assistance to improve the government affairs of Jiangsu Province and repeatedly inquired about the people's livelihood in various places and measures to suppress prices. He also met with the Commander of the Second Division, Ren Zuxuan, the Chief of Staff of the Provincial Garrison, Huang Qixing, the Director of the Provincial Government Affairs Department, Director Xu, the Director of the Finance Department, Director Pei, the Director of the Education Department, Director Yuan, the Police Commissioner, Director Zong, the Manager of the Local Bank, Manager Ren, and others, and had cordial talks with them. He repeatedly expressed his condolences and encouragement regarding the entry of Suzhou Province's tax revenue into the right track and the elimination of corruption among officials. Ministers Ye, Ding, and Zhao also expressed their opinions separately. In the afternoon, Governor Ren accompanied Acting Chairman Chen and the ministers on a tour of the Guanqian area. Acting Chairman Chen deeply praised the fact that officials, civilians, merchants, scholars, and military police officers in Suzhou Province were able to invigorate their spirits. After 5:00 PM, they left Suzhou by special train. As the various agencies were still in office hours, Governor Ren, in accordance with Acting Chairman Chen's wishes, notified the heads of the various agencies not to come to see them off, and only Governor Ren and the manager of the local bank, Ren Xiping, saw them off at the station. Before leaving, Chairman Chen instructed Governor Ren to convey his apologies to the relevant agencies for not being able to talk to them due to the limited time.

### Both Germany and the Soviet Union Send Reinforcements; Continuing Naval Battles; Soviet Progress in Germany Has Stalled

Berlin, 25th (Central News Agency Telegram) – Reuter reports: In the major battles on the Eastern Front, Soviet infantry divisions in Upper Silesia and East Prussia have approached their advancing tank units. The fighting within former Polish territory remains concentrated in two separate war zones, and both sides continue to send fresh troops as reinforcements. As for the German side, local garrison forces and newly formed people's assault teams are continuously heading to the front lines. The German army avoids direct combat, delaying the enemy's progress. German tank units often suddenly attack the flanks of the Soviet army in an attempt to buy time for the German army to implement countermeasures. The Soviet army south of the Vistula River has reached Makov along the northern border of Slovakia, but has been stopped there by the German army. The Soviet left flank advancing on the north bank of the Vistula River has not yet reached the edge of the German industrial area. Further north, the Soviet vanguard has broken through to the Oder River, with its threatened direction on the Kosel-Brieg line and its center in Ober-Glogau. At the same time, the Soviet army is pressing closer to Gleiwitz and Hindenburg, where fierce fighting is taking place. The Soviet army advancing towards Breslau from Łódź has reached the Kalisz and Oels areas, but has been pushed back by a German counterattack east of Breslau. The Soviet army advancing west south of the Vistula River is engaged in fierce fighting with the German army north of Kalisz. A portion of this army has moved to the northwest but has not yet crossed the Torun-Gniesen line. Fierce fighting is currently taking place between the Kalisz-Poznan and Bromberg Canals. In East Prussia, the Soviet offensives via Gielgenburg and Allenstein have been stopped at Morungen. The threat to southwestern East Prussia has not yet reached a critical level, and the Soviet army has been stopped south of the East Prussian Lake District. The German border guard forces have withdrawn from the Soviet army's frontal offensive and have retreated to the east bank of the Masurian Lakes. After the lines near Lötzen and Goldap were penetrated, the German army in the north also retreated. The pursuing Soviet army was stopped only after reaching the Stallupönen and Pregel areas. Although the German army in the East Prussian area has suffered territorial losses, its resistance has increased relatively. The Soviet offensive in the Courland Pocket, with Libau and Frauenburg as its center, has once again failed.

German People's Assault Troops Deployed to Eastern Front First Line

Berlin, 25th (Central News Agency Telegram) – When the Soviet army began its winter offensive, the German army headquarters immediately deployed a majority of the People's Assault Troops to the first line. According to a German military reporter on the 24th, reinforcements of strong German fresh troops have now arrived in the areas threatened by the Soviet army. However, the German army's attack reserve teams have not yet joined the war.

### Active Cooperation of Baojia Personnel

— Chen Binhe

Yesterday, at the tea party held by the Baojia personnel of this city to welcome Mayor Zhou and Secretary-General Luo, I was asked to deliver a speech. I am now transcribing it as follows:

Today, as Baojia personnel welcome Mayor Zhou, Secretary-General Luo, and all the officials, I, as a member of the Baojia, would like to offer some humble suggestions for the reference of the authorities and all my Baojia colleagues:

(1) The issue of population evacuation: cities in wartime must evacuate the population. We have discussed this numerous times. Especially in the decisive phase, Shanghai, as an important base, should have started evacuating the population long ago. Currently, the enemy is using air raid tactics to try to contain and disrupt the morale of our rear areas. We must adapt to the situation and actively implement evacuation. On the one hand, the government authorities should lead and direct; on the other hand, civil society groups should cooperate. In particular, the entire Baojia should be mobilized to ensure smooth progress. The targets of evacuation should be, first, various charitable organizations, such as those for the elderly, the disabled, orphans, infant care, and schools for the blind and deaf-mute. They absolutely do not need to stay in Shanghai. When these groups move to the interior, they can use ancestral halls, temples, and monasteries in the interior to arrange accommodation. The second step is to relocate some girls' schools, primary schools, etc. School buildings can also use the aforementioned vacant houses or merge and expand with existing schools. The third step is to assist those who voluntarily return to their hometowns, such as those who have assets and houses and land in the interior, to return home.

Recently, the Shanghai Citizens' Welfare Association is preparing to discuss evacuation methods with various hometown associations. At the same time, it will ask government agencies, such as the police bureau, Baojia office, social welfare bureau, security office, and water and land transportation agencies, to jointly organize a strong evacuation committee. For evacuation routes, inland waterway transport should be developed as much as possible. For example, prepare two small transport ships and dozens of sailing junks and fast boats, divided into morning and evening shifts, to transport evacuated people. These ships will only carry passengers one way from Shanghai to the interior and will absolutely not be allowed to carry passengers on the return trip. Instead, they will carry firewood or surplus local products to Shanghai to be used exclusively for military and police rations to compensate the military and police along the way for their protection. All evacuated travelers returning to their hometowns will be allowed to carry a considerable amount of luggage, and import and export inspection procedures will be reduced and exempted. They will also be protected by the military and police along the way. Travel expenses will be reduced or exempted as appropriate, and those in poverty will be given subsidies for travel expenses. The household registration procedures for the evacuated population must be simple and quick. As for land transportation, railway management should be thoroughly improved immediately, and several dedicated trains should be prepared, exclusively for evacuation use, without carrying ordinary passengers. The procedures for carrying luggage and inspection will be facilitated in accordance with permanent transportation regulations. The municipal government originally planned to issue treasury bonds for the evacuation committee's expenses, of which 20 million yuan was allocated for winter relief. One hundred million yuan will be taken from this to handle evacuation matters.

(2) Fully utilize the advantages of the Baojia. The population survey in the Baojia system is relatively thorough. Household distribution should fully utilize the Baojia survey. In the past, the goods distribution office did not utilize the Baojia organization. For example, the distribution of household allocation tickets could be distributed by the joint Baojia offices in each district, which would be effective and quick. However, the goods distribution office set up a separate organization to distribute household allocation tickets. The collection time was extremely short, the collection points were few, and the procedures were extremely cumbersome, causing those who received the tickets to waste time and effort and feel all sorts of difficulties. Therefore, many people were forced to give up their rights due to their duties and time constraints. This aroused the fraudulent ambitions of some people in the distribution office, which is the source of fraud. Mayor Zhou just said that future distribution will be handled using the Baojia, which is exactly the same as our proposal. We hope that this can be realized soon.

Finally, looking back at the beginning of the establishment of the Shanghai Baojia system, we never expected today's achievements. Therefore, we express our admiration for the founders and those who have worked hard to promote it. This is also the result of the hard work of the Baojia cadres, as Mayor Zhou said. Here, I think of a senior who practiced what he preached, Mr. Zhang Yipeng. Before Mr. Zhang took office as the Minister of Judicial Administration, he served as the Jia leader in the residential area. Whenever there was a blockade or curfew, he would personally go to the scene to perform his duties and never be lazy or delegate to others. This is a model figure for civilian self-initiated efforts in Baojia service. We hope that in the future, we will further promote the spirit of civilian self-initiated efforts. At the same time, the authorities, especially the military and police, should not use the Baojia too mechanically. In addition to focusing on military and security assistance, they must also pay attention to political training and cultivation work and fully give opportunities for self-initiated efforts.

The above, although a consistent advocacy, I would like to take this opportunity today to emphasize and repeat it in order to achieve rapid realization and progress.

### Capital Suppresses and Stabilizes Prices; Authorities Convene Meetings; Allied Gendarmerie Actively Cooperates

Nanjing, 25th (Central News Agency): Recently, commodity prices have risen in a straight line, soaring continuously, which has a profound and significant impact on people's livelihood. Even within the Nanjing city area, the prices inside and outside the capital are extremely disparate. In view of this, the national government authorities, in order to thoroughly maintain the stability of the general people's livelihood in the capital city area, held a meeting of relevant parties, such as the inaugural Capital City Area Essential Living Materials Price Stabilization Conference. Those in attendance were Army Minister Ye Peng, Nanjing Special City Mayor Zhou Xuechang, Capital Police Chief Li Ouyi, Central Gendarmerie Commander Chen Gao, and others. Five consecutive meetings were held separately on the 13th, 15th, 17th, 19th, and 22nd of this month, and a draft plan for the Capital City Area Essential Living Materials Price Stabilization Plan has been formulated. It is reported that it was approved by Acting Chairman Chen on the 23rd, and it was decided to establish the "Capital Materials Price Stabilization Committee." The chief committee member has been determined to be Army Minister Ye Feng, and the members are Zhou Xuechang, Li Ouyi, Chen Gao, Jiang Zuoxuan, Yuan Yuyuan, Liu Qixiong, Zhong Jianhun, Li Chang, Chen Baoliang, and ten others. It is reported that the first plenary committee meeting will be held on the 29th of this month, and the plan will be announced and implemented immediately thereafter.

Allied Cooperation

Regarding suppressing and stabilizing commodity prices in this city, our authorities have made the greatest determination and have specially organized the "Capital Materials Price Stabilization Committee" to preside over the matter, so as to see its implementation by the end of the old year. The Allied gendarmerie authorities in this capital have also decided to provide absolute cooperation. Starting from the 25th of this month, they will dispatch their troops to assist in cracking down on hoarders and speculators. The scope of this cooperation does not distinguish between Chinese and Japanese merchants, and all controlled commodities are included. In particular, the relevant authorities have approved the free entry of rice and grain from Zhonghua Gate into the city. The Japanese gendarmerie will provide as much assistance as possible to eliminate all illegal activities such as extortion along the way, so as to reassure legitimate merchants and farmers. Anyone who violates the policies determined by the authorities will be subject to severe military law. In addition, the illegal demands and theft of goods by some unscrupulous railway officials, which have always plagued legitimate travelers, will also be resolutely dealt with, so as to ensure that legitimate merchants are protected, speculators are deterred, and commodity prices are stabilized.

The heads of various bureaus and offices of the city, including Jiandong, Watanabe, Xu Jiang, Liu Dexuan, Dai Yingfu, Xu Jidun, Liu Xingchen, Li Shiyu, Man Qiwei, Gotoshima Shigeru, Hiraoka Isamu, and others, as well as Baojia Office Director Ji Wu, and Baojia committee members from various districts Lin Kangxia, Chen Binhe, Wu Yunzhai, Shen Siliang, Feng Bingnan, and others, numbering no less than 300, attended. Mayor Zhou, accompanied by Secretary-General Luo, arrived at the venue to the sound of the Self-Police Band. Everyone stood up to pay their respects. After the ceremonial proceedings, Director Gu delivered a speech, followed by Baojia committee representatives Lin Kanghou and Wu Yunzhai delivering speeches. Then, Mayor Zhou (concurrently) and Secretary-General Luo were respectfully invited to deliver instructions. Finally, Chen Binhe, director of the Baojia Propaganda Committee, delivered a speech (the speech can be found in today's newspaper editorial). The atmosphere was extremely warm and harmonious. The tea party did not end until around 6:00 p.m. The details are as follows:

Director Gu's Speech

"Mayor, Secretary-General, distinguished guests, and fellow Baojia workers, it has only been a few days since Mayor Zhou and Secretary-General Luo took office, but the entire atmosphere of Shanghai has been completely renewed. Our Baojia colleagues are holding a tea party today to express our welcome and respect to the new municipal government. The hosts of today's tea party are the directors and standing committee members of the Baojia committees in each district, as well as the heads of all the liaison offices. They are also the representatives of the people in the Baojia of this city. Although they do not receive official salaries, they are appointed or commissioned by the government and are in fact colleagues. I feel a sense of unity when we gather here today. There are also exemplary Self-Police Corps members who have taken the initiative to guard the surroundings. This exemplary Self-Police Corps is a group of knowledgeable young people selected from each district and rigorously trained to become a group of civilian forces. Their participation in the security today is a unique feature of our Baojia colleagues' support for the officials. I would also like to take this opportunity to express my joyful enthusiasm and wish Mayor Zhou, Secretary-General Luo, and all the officials good health."

Lin Kanghou's Speech

Speeches were delivered successively by Baojia committee members Lin Kanghou and Wu Yunning. Lin Kanghou said in his speech: "Today, we Baojia workers are holding a tea party here to express our admiration and love for the new municipal government officials. We are deeply honored by your presence. In order to facilitate communication between the Baojia at all levels in this city, we have established the Baojia Committee. Each Baojia district has a district committee, which serves as a consultation and liaison mechanism for the Baojia at all levels. On the one hand, it transmits and implements official policies, and on the other hand, it contributes to or reviews the demands of the people. The Shanghai Baojia has been continuously improving over the past few years. The system is gradually becoming unified, and the work is becoming more innovative. At this time, when Mayor Zhou and Secretary-General Luo are working hard to govern, our Baojia colleagues should strive to follow, be firm and brave, and serve the country and society. We should contribute as much as we can with our energy, bury ourselves in hard work, persevere, strengthen the front line of police-civilian cooperation, cooperate to maintain local security, harmonize officials and people, and promote political integrity, following Mayor Zhou's words that 'public interest is more important than private interest, and society comes before the individual'. I wish Mayor Zhou, Secretary-General Luo, and all the officials good health, and I wish all my colleagues united efforts."

Wu Yunzhai's Speech

Wu Yunzhai said in his speech: "Today, the 18 Baojia district branches and the general liaison office of this city welcome Mayor Zhou and Secretary-General Luo. I am also a member of the Baojia district, so I have been asked to say a few words. Today, we are honored that one of the officials has taken the time out of his busy schedule to come here. Mayor Zhou and Secretary-General Luo have been in politics for many years and have achieved remarkable achievements. This time, they have come to Shanghai with a great spirit and firm will. At the welcome meeting of the five groups the day before yesterday, Mayor Zhou declared that 'public interest is more important than private interest, and society comes before the individual,' and Secretary-General Luo declared that 'no favoritism, upright and selfless.' From this, we can see that we, the citizens, express our great admiration and enthusiastic expectations. The social situation in Shanghai is very complex. Mayor Chen has spent a lot of effort in the past. This time, we are fortunate to have two wise officials take on the arduous task. What a blessing for the people of Shanghai. The Baojia was originally a system that existed in ancient China. It is a self-defense organization of the people themselves. Its characteristic is to assist the government, maintain social order, and provide assistance to good people in the community and eliminate bad people. In the past three years, the Baojia system in this city has achieved considerable results through the efforts of all parties. In the future, we should continue to work hard in order to achieve the great mission of the two officials to seek a comfortable and prosperous life for the people of the city. This is what I deeply hope for."

Mayor Zhou's Speech

Then, Mayor Zhou was respectfully invited to deliver instructions, saying: "Today, I am very pleased to be invited to this grand tea party and to meet with all of you. The Shanghai Baojia has achieved very good results and has a very complete system thanks to your efforts over the past few years. I am very pleased with this. The Baojia has existed in China since ancient times, and it has been promoted several times since the Republic of China. In 1932, the National Government launched the suppression of bandits. In the three provinces of Henan, Hubei, and Anhui, in addition to military work, the Baojia was also organized to assist in politics. At that time, Secretary-General Luo was serving in the General Headquarters. Until two years before the Incident, the Baojia system gradually became widespread. At that time, people generally believed that the Baojia could never be established in Shanghai because the population was too large, the mobility was frequent, and it was a major trading port. It was unimaginable that Shanghai would establish a relatively complete Baojia system after the Incident thanks to everyone's efforts. Therefore, I believe that everything depends on people. As long as we work hard, everything can be achieved. I express my great admiration for everyone's efforts. The Baojia system is a people's organization, a link between the people and the government. It can not only promote laws and regulations but also convey public opinion. Good people are organized, and bad people are eliminated, but we must never abuse our power and add another layer of oppression to the people. This kind of situation is quite common in rural areas. I am confident that this phenomenon will not occur in Shanghai, and I hope that we can prevent this kind of malpractice. Secondly, the Baojia organization should promote government orders to assist the government. The Baojia personnel in Shanghai should work hard in this regard. At the same time, in the future, the municipal government hopes that the Baojia will assist in the distribution of goods so that it can be fair and universal. In the future, I hope that you can maintain the advantages of the past so that the Baojia system can be smoothly promoted."

Secretary-General Luo's Instructions

"After following Mayor Zhou to Shanghai, I am very pleased to be invited to the tea party by the Baojia workers in this city today. The performance of the Shanghai Baojia has achieved considerable results in society and has not disappointed your past hard work. The rapid progress of public security in Shanghai recently is sufficient proof of the extensive and effective organization of the Baojia. Currently, Shanghai is stepping up the training of community defense team members and carefully selecting Baojia cadres. The Baojia administration is gradually becoming sound. I have great expectations for the lineup of Baojia workers. Since the establishment of the self-police corps, they have been helping each other and eliminating theft and preventing illegal actions. This is really good. Recently, the self-police corps and Baojia personnel took on the central work in the air defense exercise. It cannot be said that this is not a contribution of the Baojia system to assisting the military and police. The ration system based on household population is based on the Baojia household registration. Members of the self-police corps have the responsibility to supervise and report all crimes in society. Therefore, all matters related to maintaining order at stations and docks, rectifying the discipline of red and black hats, alleviating the pain of long queues for distributed goods, reporting hoarders and unscrupulous merchants, and the activities of all bad elements all depend on the cooperation of the Baojia self-police. The municipal government will impose severe sanctions separately, so as not to fail the expectations of the citizens for a stable life."

### Municipal Donations and Taxes to Be Revalued

The Shanghai Municipal Finance Bureau is now actively rectifying finances. For donations and taxes in the urban area, it has decided to reform and adjust them on the principle of not increasing the burden on merchants and residents. For example, the tax rates for bamboo and wood donations and housing donations, etc., are based on valuations made a year ago, which are no longer suitable for current valuation standards. Therefore, in order to enhance tax administration and enrich municipal treasury revenue, it has been decided to revalue the valuation of various donations and taxes in accordance with current material value standards.

### Special Tax on Fresh Meat to Be Collected Centrally Starting Today

The Shanghai Livestock Industry Pork Retailers Association previously stated that members requested that it was quite inconvenient to pay the special consumption tax in a piecemeal manner. Therefore, it petitioned the financial authorities to change the tax collection to be collected centrally by the slaughterhouse in the future, and the tax amount was set at 800 yuan per pig, which will be implemented starting today.

### Post Office Revises International Postage

The Shanghai Post Office issued a notice revising international postage rates, stating: "Pursuant to the order of the Shanghai Office of the Postal Administration General Bureau, approved by the Ministry of Construction, the international postage rates and special rates in the third category of the postage rate table will be revised from January 20 of this year.

The newly revised rates are listed below:

### Through Airmail to Dalian Temporarily Suspended

The Shanghai Postal Administration recently announced that the acceptance of airmail to Dalian for the entire journey, which is carried by plane, has been temporarily suspended. However, mail to that location can still use domestic airmail to Tianjin, and then be delivered by ordinary mail route. In addition to affixing sufficient ordinary postage, domestic airmail fees should be added. For registered mail, registration fees should also be added.

### Laozha Branch Reiterates Orders for All Businesses to Operate on Time; Customers Violating the Law Will Be Detained for Five Days

The Laozha Branch, after investigating that the entertainment venues in the district are concentrated, has strengthened strict management, especially regarding the operating hours of dancing, cafes, restaurants, and other businesses. It has long ordered that they must comply with the municipal government's regulations and restrictions and close at 10 p.m. every night. The past situation has been very good, but recently there are still some illegal merchants who dare to disregard the law, and the old habits have reappeared, superficially complying but secretly violating, operating secretly beyond the prescribed time, which is extremely illegal. After receiving a tip, the branch ordered the administrative section members to secretly investigate. In addition, it reiterated the previous order, informing all entertainment venues in writing that they must operate on time. If there is another violation, it will be severely punished according to law. As for the customers who stay, they will also be punished with five days of detention according to Article 37 of the Police Law.

### Coal Industry Joint Operating Society Holds Establishment Meeting

The China Industrial Association, in view of the current coal shortage in Shanghai, which has reached an extreme point and has had a great impact on industrial production, has mobilized the coal industry to organize the Shanghai Coal Industry Joint Operating Society in order to promote increased production and dredge coal sources.

### Interim Measures for Reorganizing Private Schools

The Shanghai Bureau of Education is paying close attention to the registration and establishment of private schools at all levels. Therefore, last winter, it specially requested and received approval from the municipal government to establish a Private School Establishment and Registration Review Committee. Senior officials of the bureau were selected to be responsible for handling the matter. All private schools submitting applications for establishment or recordation by the board of directors, as well as the procedures for establishing a school, are first carefully reviewed by the committee to determine whether they comply with the revised regulations for private schools promulgated by the ministry. Then, they are submitted to the director for approval, in order to show due solemnity. Recently, a considerable number of private schools in this city have submitted applications for establishment, recordation, or registration, which are currently being processed by the bureau. However, it is reported that some schools are still unclear about the procedures for handling the above-mentioned matters, resulting in requests for corrections or supplements after review, which wastes time. It is understood that the bureau has prepared various forms for establishment, registration request forms, notices for establishment registration, and model articles of association for the board of directors, so that private schools can obtain them. In addition, it has also formulated an "Interim Measures for Reorganizing Private Primary and Secondary Schools," which specifies: (A) Schools that were already established before the Incident [likely referring to a specific historical event] and have certificates only need to register. (B) Schools that were already established before the Incident, and whose certificates are lost but have other appropriate supporting documents to prove it, also only need to register. (C) Schools that were established before the Incident but whose certificates are lost and have no appropriate supporting documents must re-establish. (D) If the board of directors has not been registered, or if the school has been established, but the school site, school property, or board of directors has undergone special changes after the Incident, establishment or registration procedures must be carried out. Furthermore, all matters handled according to the revised regulations for private schools promulgated by the ministry must be submitted by the founder's board of directors with a formal request.

### Hua Tie Theft: Stolen Goods Recovered from Shops

The Hua Zhong Railway Company has recently reported repeated thefts of materials along its lines. Therefore, a supervisory office was specially established in Shanghai, and Li Turong, a specialist transferred from Beijing, was appointed as the director of the office to actively conduct secret investigations. It was recently discovered that Yongtai Iron Shop at No. 1221 Qiujiang Road, Zhabei, and an iron shop on Bei Xi Road were privately receiving stolen goods from the company. The company immediately reported this to the police authorities, who searched the shops and found twenty bundles of stolen steel bars, one iron axle, and a considerable amount of iron plates and railway materials. Since the two shops were found to have received stolen goods, the shop owners were arrested and are currently being interrogated to determine the source of the stolen goods and to apprehend the thieves.

### Tonight's Basketball A League: Zhongbei vs. Shan Team; Women's League: Three Provinces vs. Overseas Chinese

The Shanghai Open Basketball League continues tonight with three games, starting at 6:00 p.m. at the Army Dormitory (West Qing) gymnasium. The first game is the women's league match between Three Provinces and Overseas Chinese. Among the ten armies of women, the Green Team is considered stronger, followed by Three Provinces and Overseas Chinese. Therefore, this game is nothing less than a battle for the runner-up. The second game is between V Team and the YMCA. The YMCA's momentum is strong, and a fierce battle is inevitable. The final game is between Zhongbei and Shan Team. The two teams previously played against each other in the Shen Bao Cup League, and the Shan Team's soldiers fought hard and overcame Zhongbei.

The Shan Team's fighting spirit is superior to all teams. The outcome of the rematch is uncertain. To avoid crowding tonight, tickets are priced at 300 yuan and 500 yuan.

### Shanghai Citizens' Welfare Association Launches Fundraising for Winter Relief

In view of the large number of extremely poor and hidden poor among the citizens of Shanghai, it is particularly necessary to provide assistance during this winter season. The association has decided to raise 50 million yuan to purchase miscellaneous grains and carry out price equalization. The municipal government has established a Winter Relief Committee, and most of the members of the association have participated in the work of the Winter Relief Committee. For example, Chen Riping, a director of the association, is the deputy director of the Winter Relief Committee. In order to save administrative expenses, it was decided to entrust the Winter Relief Committee to handle the matter. In order to expedite the process, the Central Reserve Bank was first requested to assist by lending 50 million yuan, which was immediately handed over to the Winter Relief Committee for disposal. The Winter Relief Committee has first launched three temporary relief projects (see news in previous newspapers). However, the loan is agreed to be repaid in three installments, with the first installment due on February 10th, which is approaching soon. The board of directors of the association decided to entrust Xin Shen and Shen Bao newspapers to publicly raise funds. It is hoped that wealthy and charitable people in Shanghai will generously donate money to benefit the poor. Donations can be sent directly to the social service departments of Xin Shen and Shen Bao newspapers for collection. The titles of donors will be published separately in Xin Shen and Shen Bao newspapers.
