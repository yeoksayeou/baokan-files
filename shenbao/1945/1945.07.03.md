Balikpapan, 2nd (Central News Agency Dispatch) - Since the 15th of last month, enemy forces have launched intense artillery fire and bombing on Balikpapan for as long as sixteen days, attempting to land. Subsequently, at 1:30 AM on the 1st of this month, a portion of enemy forces landed near Supokajakrama, 50 kilometers north of Balikpapan. Furthermore, at approximately 9:00 AM on the same day, under the cover of intense artillery fire and bombing, they attempted to approach the Balikpapan area with over one hundred landing craft of various sizes, and began landing at three locations: near the coastal streets, markets, and Thousand Islands. Currently, the Japanese garrison in that area is engaged in fierce fighting with the landing enemy forces.

Southwest Pacific Base, 2nd (Central News Agency Dispatch) - It has been over ten days since enemy forces attempted to land at Balikpapan in the southeastern part of Borneo Island. During this period, the enemy's naval gun fire has been extraordinarily intense. At approximately 8:00 AM on the 1st, they finally began landing with landing boats. The initial landing force numbered approximately 5,000 troops, and is currently being continuously reinforced. The Japanese garrison is also exerting its full strength to engage the enemy.

That evening, five large cruisers, twelve destroyers, thirty-one minesweepers, two oil tankers, and one work ship, totaling fifty-one vessels, were discovered near the coast. At dawn on the 30th, the enemy ships indeed began intense artillery fire on the Japanese military positions. At the same time, squadrons of large and medium-sized aircraft, such as B24 and B29, arrived in succession to conduct persistent bombing. Shortly thereafter, the boats attempted to begin landing, and the artillery battle between the two sides gradually intensified.

Southern Front Base, 2nd (Central News Agency Dispatch) - The enemy at Brunei Bay sailed up the Padas River in boats on the 24th and landed at Beaufort.

### Japanese Foreign Minister Hosts Banquet for Philippine President; Mutual Declarations of Resolve During the Meeting

Tokyo, 2nd (Central News Agency Dispatch) - Japanese Foreign Minister and Minister for Greater East Asia, Tōgō Shigenori, hosted a banquet for Philippine President José Laurel at the Imperial Hotel at 6:00 PM on the 28th. During the banquet, Foreign Minister Tōgō and President Laurel delivered speeches in turn.

Foreign Minister Tōgō's Speech:

President Laurel and all of you present at this banquet have resolutely cooperated with the Empire to realize the independence of the Philippines and further build the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, making significant contributions to the Greater East Asia War. The Empire, both the government and the people, express deep gratitude for this. Recently, the enemy British and Americans have again invaded the Philippines, and the war situation there is quite urgent. However, the Empire's determination to complete the war will not be shaken in the slightest. The Empire's government has repeatedly clarified in the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration and the joint statement of the Greater East Asia Ambassadors' Conference that it seeks to realize its ideals, even if it means liberating Greater East Asia from the exploitation of Britain and the United States, enabling each nation and ethnicity of Greater East Asia to find its place, ensuring the stability of Greater East Asia, and promoting comprehensive world peace. To achieve this goal, we are determined to thoroughly destroy the ambitions of Britain and the United States toward East Asia, and we will not stop until we achieve our objective. I have always expressed support for the independence of the Philippines, and I also pray for the success of your endeavors.

President Laurel's Speech:

Japan has provided great assistance to the independence of the Republic of the Philippines. Not only as the President of the Philippines, but also on behalf of all Filipino citizens, I express my deep gratitude. I firmly believe that the peoples of Greater East Asia should be liberated from the domination of Western Europe. No matter how great the sacrifices we must pay for this, we should endure them so that our children and grandchildren can survive and prosper. The enemy may want to take our lives, and the enemy's bombing may want to destroy our physical bodies, but we must obtain freedom and not allow others to interfere. Asia should be Asia for Asians, and the Philippines should be the Philippines for Filipinos.

### US Pacific War Theater Coal Oil Consumption Surges

Lisbon, 2nd (Central News Agency Dispatch) - The United States, which boasts abundant resources, is showing signs of anxiety due to the huge consumption it is enduring, especially the fuel shortage in the Pacific front. According to a New York Journal report on the 29th regarding the efforts of the United States' Pacific coast to replenish fuel to the Pacific front, the following is stated: The coal oil being transported to the front is currently being loaded at ports in Southern California. The amount of coal oil currently being transported to the Pacific front using oil tankers averages 14 million barrels per month, which is more than twice the amount in the previous two years. According to authorities in the coal oil sector, the amount of coal oil currently consumed in the Pacific is expected to exceed the amount consumed in both the European and Pacific war zones before the end of the European war. This is mainly because the Pacific front is solely a naval war, so huge replenishment ships are needed, and the replenishment ships themselves also consume huge amounts of fuel and internal combustion engine oil. In addition, as bombing battles become more intense, the gasoline used by aircraft is also increasing daily. To meet this huge need, it is necessary to strengthen the extraction of coal oil from the California oil fields.

### Explanation of Bail Procedures for Criminal Defendants by Vice Minister Zhao

Since the Ministry of Judicial Administration promulgated the Bail Procedures for Criminal Defendants, all courts and prosecutors' offices have been ordered to comply, greatly easing the overcrowding in detention centers. However, the parties involved are not yet fully aware of the procedures. Vice Minister Zhao of the Ministry of Judicial Administration recently convened the President of the Shanghai Higher Court and the presiding judge of the criminal division to provide a detailed explanation to avoid misunderstandings. The "but" clause in Article 3 of the procedures is only a "but" clause for this article, meaning that defendants charged with the crimes listed in Article 2 should, in principle, be detained and this "but" clause does not apply. Even if the defendants listed in Article 2 meet the conditions of the "but" clauses in Article 3, detention is still the principle. This "but" clause only refers to defendants other than those listed in Article 2 who should be released on bail if they meet the conditions of any of the clauses, and it does not apply as an exception to Article 2. The application of Clause 3 of the "but" clause is the responsibility of the presiding judge. If Clause 4 of the procedures is applicable, the approval of the superior must be obtained first, and a written ruling must be made.

Editorial

### Song Ziwen's Trip to Moscow

Song Ziwen, Premier and Foreign Minister of Chongqing, along with Deputy Foreign Minister Hu Shize and a group of others, arrived in Moscow on June 30th and held talks with Stalin and Molotov on the same day. It goes without saying that this news has attracted attention and speculation.

There are three points to note about this news: First, Song Ziwen's trip to the Soviet Union is a practical implementation of the proposal to strengthen Sino-Soviet diplomatic relations passed by the Sixth National Congress of the Chongqing Kuomintang; second, Song Ziwen's delegation to the Soviet Union consists of as many as fifty people, almost as many as the delegation that participated in the San Francisco Conference; third, this Chongqing-Soviet meeting is taking place on the eve of the Three-Power Conference, which is said to be held in the German Imperial Palace in the suburbs of Berlin.

Because of the above three points, we can imagine the importance of this Chongqing-Soviet meeting. Although there is not enough information available to confirm the mission of Song Ziwen and his party, judging from the current domestic and international situation, the general speculation is that it consists of the following points:

First, the issue of improving Chongqing-Soviet relations: Chongqing-Soviet relations, after the establishment of the non-aggression pact in 1937, once improved. In the subsequent three years, the Soviet Union provided Chongqing with a considerable amount of material assistance in the form of barter trade. This relationship came to an end with the recurrence of Chongqing-Communist conflicts in various places in the winter of 1940 and the Anhui Incident in the spring of 1941. The Japanese-Soviet Neutrality Pact was then established in April of that year. Since then, Chongqing-Soviet relations have reversed. In addition, with the outbreak of the German-Soviet war, the Soviet Union was preoccupied with the West, and its relations with Chongqing were further interrupted. The anti-Soviet movement in Chongqing also increased day by day. The Xinjiang-Outer Mongolia border conflict in the winter of 1943 and the establishment of the new Japanese-Soviet treaty in the spring of 1944 were blatant expressions of the deteriorating Chongqing-Soviet relations. However, since the rapid turn of events in the European war this year, Chongqing has increasingly felt uneasy and threatened by the Soviet Union's new position in determining the world situation, and it is eager to seize the opportunity to adjust relations to prevent the Soviet Union from changing its attitude and assisting the CCP. This trip to the Soviet Union by Song Ziwen and his party, this defensive diplomatic mission to the Soviet Union, is the most important point.

Second, the issue of mediating Chongqing-Communist relations: Of course, the Soviet government has repeatedly stated that it does not interfere in the internal affairs of any country. However, in practice, it does not want its neighbors to be anti-Soviet buffer zones, as has been seen in various Soviet diplomatic documents in recent times. Therefore, it has recently been increasingly critical of the increasingly fierce Chongqing-Communist conflict in its official newspapers. All of the Soviet Union's main materials for criticizing Chongqing are the same as the remarks made by the CCP through the Xinhua News Agency. Therefore, to thoroughly resolve the Chongqing-Communist relationship, at least on the Chongqing side, most of the powerful leaders advocate direct negotiations with the Soviet Union. Song Ziwen's second major task on this trip is, of course, this point.

Third, regarding the plans of Britain, the United States, and Chongqing to launch a general counteroffensive against Japan in mainland China, there have been various signs of development recently, and the Soviet Union's capabilities at that time are Chongqing's greatest concern. This serious issue was discussed by Song Ziwen and other representatives of Britain and the United States after attending the San Francisco Conference and before returning home, and he exchanged views with Truman in Washington. At that time, there were rumors in the international community that Song Ziwen would go to the Soviet Union, but since this matter was of great importance, Song Ziwen could not make a decision on his own before clarifying the opinions of Chiang Kai-shek and the leaders of the Chongqing faction. Therefore, he first returned to Chongqing to consult and then went to the Soviet Union. It is almost certain that he has a detailed plan for negotiations with the Soviet Union.

Except for the third level, which is related to Chongqing-Communist relations, it will likely be resolved only after the Berlin Three-Power Conference. Song Ziwen's actions towards the Soviet Union only have the significance of providing a one-sided plan. Judging from the existing materials, it seems that his first and second missions will not have any major gains. Because, first, Chongqing's actions towards the Soviet Union are defensive and passive, and the main purpose is only to hope that under the guise of improving Chongqing-Soviet relations, the Soviet Union will not interfere in Chongqing's domestic and foreign policies. However, the Soviet Union will never be satisfied with this. Second, regarding the adjustment of the Chongqing-Communist issue, the Chongqing side's prerequisite is that the CCP will not be allowed to have an independent government and army, while the CCP's prerequisite is that a so-called democratic coalition government must be established, and the CCP must actually participate. Because the two sides have different prerequisites, the CCP's proposal for a coalition government is tantamount to negating the Chongqing regime dominated by the Chiang-Song faction. How can Chongqing agree to this? How can the United States agree to this?

### Xin Port of Jiangbei

— Chen Ting

Xin Port is an important city in Jingjiang County. It is located north of the Yangtze River, west of Zhanghuang Port, facing Jiangyin County. The river surface there is relatively narrow and the terrain is dangerous, no less than Jiangyin.

Since the Incident, the coastal areas of the Yangtze River have been reorganized and the local customs have gradually become more robust. Passengers traveling back and forth on the Yangtze River are often at risk of piracy and robbery. Moreover, there are currently no steamboats, and all travel is by sailboat. The loss of life and property suffered by passengers is countless. The severity of the harm is almost unimaginable to outsiders.

This time, I accompanied the Xin Port protection pig boat from the Shanghai Water Patrol Team back to Xin Port. Since they all had weapons, I felt much safer. On this day, we encountered a northwest wind, and the sailboat traveled very slowly. It was not until the third day that we reached Xin Port. Along the way, we docked at Langshan, Tiansheng Port, and Zhangdian Port. At night, the members of the Water Police Team took turns on guard, and the shouts and gunshots continued all night.

Commercial Situation

The town of Xin Port is quite lively, with shops and stalls lining the streets, especially the latter. The entire town was burned down during the Incident, and the existing houses are all newly built. There are only two or three buildings in the entire town, and the rest are bungalows. Commerce mainly involves the export of pigs, edible oil, eggs, and rice, and the import of daily necessities, cigarettes, sugar, etc. The export of the famous Jiangbei pigs is one of the important concentration points of Xin Port. Therefore, there are many pig firms and transportation companies in the town, and they all have close relationships with each other, because the transportation companies all operate the export of pigs.

In addition, the price difference between Shanghai and Xin Port is very large, so the practice of discounts is very popular. For example, if 70,000 yuan is paid to a pig firm or transportation company in Xin Port, the bills issued can be exchanged for 100,000 yuan in Shanghai.

All other imports and exports are carried by individual peddlers, who are said to make a lot of profit. The price of rice there was 200,000 yuan a month ago, which is about half the price of rice in Shanghai. However, all daily necessities are reliant on Shanghai, and they are more than twice as expensive as in Shanghai. The difficulty of transportation is the main reason for its high cost.

Rivers in Jiangbei are very scarce, and there is insufficient water, resulting in poor production. Very little rice is produced, and the quality of the rice is also poor. The better quality is called "fan mi" (rice for eating) by the locals, which is produced in Jiangyin and transported in. It is what the Shanghai people call "du mi" (special rice). Most of the farmers mainly grow wheat, and pig farming is also popular. Most of the pigs are transported to Shanghai.

The farmers in the suburbs of Xin Port live a very hard life. In addition to poor production, they mainly eat porridge made from wheat, barley, buckwheat, sorghum, and other flours. The poor eat carrots (red sweet potatoes) or sweet potatoes. In fact, carrots are rich in vitamins, but the villagers are ignorant and do not know it.

The locals eat puffer fish a lot, and I have not heard of anyone dying from it. I guess they are good at killing and eating it. They discard the blood, eggs, and eyes, and add a lot of lard, rock sugar, and sauce, and simmer it for a day and a night before eating it. The taste is sweet and delicious. The price of fish is very expensive. Eating one puffer fish costs about 100,000 gold, so ordinary people rarely eat it. It is only served at major banquets. However, when I ate it, I only felt that the meat was coarse and the taste of the fish was the opposite of what people said.

Transportation and Security

To Shanghai, there are sailboats, or ferries to Jiangyin, and then by land to Shanghai. To the county town of Jingjiang, there are single-seat tricycles, and the fare is about 10,000 yuan. To other towns and villages, most people use hand-pushed wheelbarrows.

The level of education is very poor. There is only one elementary school in the entire town. For middle school, you have to go to the Zhennan Middle School in Jingjiang Town. Therefore, the cultural level of the villagers is very low.

The practice of extortion in Xin Port is very prevalent, especially towards individual peddlers from Shanghai. Currently, the shipping of boats has stopped, and their income has plummeted!

Four or five li out of Xin Port into the countryside, you enter another sphere of influence. Most of the young farmers are militiamen. If there are suspicious people, they must carefully search and interrogate them before letting them pass.

I stayed in the port for half a month this time, and then transferred from Jiangyin through Wuxi back to Shanghai. The cost was only one day and night. Thinking about the difficulty of going out now, I can't help but feel the difference between the present and the past.

### British and American Troops Withdraw to New Boundary in Germany

Stockholm, Sweden, 2nd (Central News Agency Dispatch) - According to messages received here: "In order to fulfill the agreement of the United States, the Soviet Union, France, and the four countries jointly occupying Berlin, the British troops in the Baltic Sea and Mecklenburg began to withdraw from the northeastern region of Germany yesterday morning." According to reports, this area has been occupied by British troops since the German army surrendered to General Montgomery. At the same time, except for slight changes in the British troops stationed in the demarcation line between the British and Soviet occupation zones, there are said to be large-scale troop movements in the southern region. It is reported that this large-scale movement of troops and defensive positions is based on an agreement between British Prime Minister Churchill, Soviet Chairman Stalin, and the late US President Roosevelt. The city of Wismar on the Baltic Sea, formerly occupied by the British Sixth Division, is now under the jurisdiction of the Soviet authorities. Currently, the new British demarcation line runs from the north around to the southwest and the eastern part of Lübeck, ending in the southwest of the Elbe River. At the same time, Soviet troops moved into the Baltic region withdrawn by the British troops last night. The region is 27 kilometers wide and 40 kilometers long, including the important towns of Schwerin, Röteveck, Sloster, Hagenow, Schaanberg, part of Lütowburg, and the main port city of Wismar in the region.

### People's Food Regulation Committee Decides on Methods for Procuring Coarse Grains; All Organizations Including Industry and Commerce Can Participate Individually

The Standing Committee of the Shanghai Municipal Advisory Committee and the Essential Commodities Subcommittee held a joint meeting on the 27th of last month to discuss the procurement of food and regulation of the people's food supply in the city. It was decided to establish the "Shanghai Special Municipality People's Food Regulation Committee" to implement the measures, and Li Sihao and eight others were elected as members, which has been approved by the Municipal Government. The People's Food Regulation Committee convened its first meeting at 4:00 PM yesterday, attended by Li Sihao, Hu Zewu, Liu Xingchen, Xiang Kangyuan, Sun Yaodong, Dai [illegible], Chen Bin [illegible], etc. Chaired by Li Sihao, the following methods for procuring coarse grains in the first phase were decided upon:

Decided Methods

A fund of one million yuan will be established, half of which will be divided into ten thousand units, each unit being fifty yuan, to be subscribed by various civil organizations and institutions. The other half will be raised by the Municipal Government for general distribution purposes.

All organizations in industry and commerce (factories, shops), schools, cultural institutions, hospitals, and other organizations can participate individually. Each group of 20 people can subscribe to one unit. Any institution or organization can subscribe to [illegible]

The coarse grains will mainly consist of wheat flour, and other types of coarse grains will be evenly distributed by the committee.

The procurement period is approximately one and a half months, but the coarse grains will be dispatched as they arrive, with the order of distribution based on the order of payment.

The payment period is from July 5th to the 20th, and no payments will be accepted after the deadline.

Payments should be made at the Bank of Shanghai Rehabilitation and its branches, and coarse grains should be collected from the Bureau of Economic Affairs.

The dates for collecting coarse grains will be announced in newspapers.

The price of the coarse grains and transportation costs will be shared equally by the participating organizations and institutions. At the end of the first phase of procurement, the committee will publicly report all accounts.

The methods for procuring coarse grains this time are slightly different from the previous price-controlled rice initiatives. For example, previously [illegible] tragic family groups, industry and commerce were targeted at [illegible] trade associations. This time, industry and commerce participate directly and individually, without going through trade associations. [Illegible] payments can also be made by promissory note. All of this is for the convenience of organizations to participate and [illegible] consideration for the people's food supply. It is hoped that all sectors will pay attention.

### All Banks and Firms to Stop Using Funds Transfer Orders Starting Today; Those Issued Previously Should Be Recalled as Much as Possible

The funds transfer orders issued by banks, money shops, and the Central Reserve Bank in the city have been circulating well in the market. However, some banks and firms have been issuing them excessively, often creating empty promises. To prevent credit expansion, the Central Reserve Bank ordered the banks and money shops to recall them within a limited time and to eliminate the opportunity for counterfeit funds transfer orders to be mixed in. It is understood that all banks and firms will uniformly stop using and issuing these funds transfer orders starting today (3rd). All previously issued funds transfer orders will also be recalled as much as possible starting today and will no longer be circulated. For deposits withdrawn by fellow merchants and customers, it has also been decided to prioritize payment in cash. The remaining amount will be replaced by issuing each bank's own cashier's checks, each check having parallel horizontal lines indicating that it is an immediate payment cashier's check and additionally stamped with a limited presentation period of ten days. This measure is purely to prevent empty promises and counterfeiting. It is expected that the cash position required by banks and firms starting today will be particularly relaxed compared to last month.
