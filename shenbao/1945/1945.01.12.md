### Areas Along the Rennga Coast: Elite Japanese Troops Repel Enemy Forces; Air Force Transforms into Suicide Squadrons, Fighting with Human Bombs

Central News Agency, Philippine Front, 11th -- After the enemy forcibly landed on the Rennga coastal area on the morning of the 9th, they continued to gradually increase their forces in the area connecting San Fabian, Dagupan, and the coast of Rennga Bay, landing a considerable number of tanks. Conversely, elite Japanese ground troops are delaying and attacking the enemy, continuing their heroic fight with human bombs. The Japanese Air Force has also completely transformed into suicide squadrons, successively crashing into ships inside and outside the bay, forcing the arrogant enemy to suffer heavy casualties. Enemy warships or transport ships fully loaded with soldiers and supplies, etc., were struck by Japanese aircraft and mostly sunk, catching fire and burning, presenting a very miserable scene. Around 1:20 PM on the 10th, the enemy attempted to land 15 kilometers north of Rapu-Rapu and San Fabian. Japanese artillery in that area lured the enemy landing craft to the closest possible range and then opened fire all at once, inflicting heavy damage. At the same time, fifty soldiers completely drove the enemy back. Although the enemy warships and soldiers suffered heavy damage under the brave fighting of the Japanese army, the enemy's forces continued to gradually increase. As of the morning of the 10th, new ships visible to the naked eye within Rennga Bay numbered about 200 over 500 tons and 100 under 500 tons. However, due to the continuous attacks by Japanese aircraft in recent days, the firepower of the fleet and the bombing from aircraft on board has gradually weakened since the morning of the 10th.

Central News Agency, From a certain Japanese military base on the Philippine Front, 11th -- The enemy is eager to land on Luzon Island and is currently dispatching reinforcements. At present, with ten large military transport ships as the core, there is a second convoy of about 150 ships and a third convoy of 100 or 150 ships as follow-up forces. Based on the movements of these convoys, it is estimated that the enemy landing force numbers four to five divisions.

Japanese Troops Embrace Mines to Shatter Enemy Tanks

Central News Agency, From a certain Japanese military base on the Rennga Bay Front, 10th -- The arrogant American troops are blindly landing towards the defense positions of the Japanese fortress on Luzon Island, aiming to invade Luzon Island. The enemy transport convoy anchored in Rennga Bay has been subjected to fierce attacks by Japanese Air Force suicide squadrons since the 6th, 7th, and 8th. On the morning of the 9th, under the cover of intense naval artillery and carrier-based aircraft, they forcibly began landing. Enemy gunboats then engaged in fierce artillery battles with Japanese ground troops. The enemy transport convoy, consisting of about 100 ships, formed two columns. Various landing craft, ranging from 4,000-ton to 2,000-3,000-ton vessels, approached the coast under the cover of destroyers. Japanese artillery fire exploded among the enemy ships. Enemy boats were seen hit about 50 meters from the shore, with many enemy soldiers falling into the sea. Japanese ground machine guns fired continuously. Enemy amphibious tanks began to disembark, but the front of large ships that had been hit continued to advance while firing, but many were destroyed by Japanese positions. Afterwards, the number of enemy soldiers landing under tank protection gradually increased. When enemy tanks drove into the area, Japanese soldiers hid by the roadside, embracing mines. When the enemy tanks approached, they rushed forward. Instantly, thick smoke spread, and iron fragments flew everywhere. A deep hole appeared in the ground, and both the enemy tank and the brave Japanese soldier were reduced to dust.

MacArthur Acknowledges Heavy Losses During Landing

Central News Agency, Lisbon, 11th -- According to MacArthur's headquarters, MacArthur personally went to the front line to direct operations. The American mobile units landing in Rennga Bay are the American Sixth Army under Krueger, covered by naval units of the Seventh Fleet under Kinkaid and air forces under the Australian Creagh. The Third Fleet under Halsey is also assisting in the operation. MacArthur's headquarters also announced on the morning of the 10th: Our forces, under the cover of naval and air forces, began landing on Luzon Island. Japanese air forces have repeatedly attacked our forces fiercely, and we have suffered considerable losses.

Three American Destroyers Sunk in the Pacific

Central News Agency, Lisbon, 11th -- Washington report: The U.S. Navy Department announced on the 10th that the American destroyers USS Hull, USS Monaghan, both 1,395 tons, and USS Spence, 2,200 tons, operating in the western Pacific, were all sunk by typhoons. In addition, four landing craft, one PT boat, one small submarine chaser, and one small auxiliary ship were sunk by the Japanese military. The crews of the USS Hull and USS Monaghan each consisted of 150 men, and the crew of the USS Spence consisted of about 220 men.

Japanese Submarines Launch Torpedoes, Sinking Four Enemy Ships

Central News Agency, Philippine Island Base, 11th -- On the afternoon of the 5th, Japanese submarines sank two enemy transport ships and two medium-sized transport ships with torpedoes in the Mindanao Sea.

### Japanese Air Force Conducts a Sudden Attack on Morotai Airfield

### Interview with Mr. Matsumoto, Japanese Ambassador to Vietnam

Central News Agency, Saigon, 11th -- Since last year, Mr. Matsumoto, the Japanese Ambassador to Vietnam, has been conducting sincere discussions with the leaders of the Vietnamese government in Hanoi. Having completed his mission, he returned to Saigon on the afternoon of the 9th. When meeting with a group of reporters, Ambassador Matsumoto described his impressions of his meeting with Governor-General Decoux as follows: Governor-General Decoux is determined to do his best within the possible scope between Japan and Vietnam, adhering firmly to the consistent policy. The Governor-General himself will be particularly careful during this critical situation to ensure no mistakes are made, and he will abolish the Supreme Council and establish the Vietnamese Advisory Council to gather public wisdom and follow public opinion.

### Enemy Convoy at Akyab Harbor Continuously Bombed; One Large Cruiser Sunk

Central News Agency, Burma Front Base, 11th -- Japanese air force units attacked the enemy transport convoy in the Akyab area on the 9th. On the 10th, they used new bomber squadrons to attack the wharf area of Akyab Harbor, causing seven fires, one of which was destroyed and another of which exploded. In addition, another unit attacked Ywahu, northwest of Mandalay, inflicting heavy bombing on the enemy forces there, causing a major fire. The Japanese aircraft safely returned to base.

Central News Agency, Japanese Military Base on the Burma Front, 11th -- In order to retake Burma, the enemy has been launching landings in the Akyab area from the Mayu Peninsula with ship-borne mobile units since the end of last year. However, the elite fighter squadron of the Burmese air force launched a fierce attack on the afternoon of the 9th, bravely diving and bombing amidst intense enemy anti-aircraft fire. Two large bombs hit one of their vanguard escort large cruisers, causing it to catch fire and sink, and heavily damaged two large transport ships (the sinking of one of them has been confirmed). One 300-ton boat was sunk, and three enemy four-engine fighter planes and small fighter planes flying nearby were shot down. Three Japanese aircraft did not return from this operation.

Central News Agency, Stockholm, 11th -- The London Times newspaper discussed the Burmese battlefield on the 7th as follows: Up to now, the Japanese army can be said to be fighting with the greatest determination. Recently, the Japanese army may have a tendency to resist from Nankam to the Irrawaddy River, and from north of Shwebo to Mandalay, through this group of air bases to the port of Monywa on the Rangoon River. It is observed that the Japanese army may have the possibility of consolidating its position on this line and that fierce battles may break out in the area of the air base group in the Shwebo and Monywa corner.

### Interview with Vice Minister Jiang of the Ministry of Industries: This Year's Key Production Increase Budget is Tripled Compared to Last Year

Central News Agency, Nanjing, 11th -- Increasing production is a prerequisite for improving people's livelihoods and enhancing combat capabilities. Therefore, the National Government has made this a key focus of its policies for several years, exerting all efforts to promote it. The actual results of production increases over the past three years and the promotion policies for this year are also of great concern to all parties. The Central News Agency reporter visited Mr. Jiang Zuoxuan, Vice Minister of the Ministry of Industries, who provided the following summary:

Last year, agricultural management focused on experimental work. The experimental results for rice, wheat, and coarse grains were satisfactory. Forestry and land reclamation and seedling cultivation focused on expanding the area. However, these tasks cannot be accomplished overnight and require years of accumulation to see results. As for this year's agricultural production increase promotion policy, the first is to simplify the implementation structure. In the past, there were numerous names for agricultural improvement areas, forestry and land reclamation demonstration farms, seedling cultivation farms, and cotton seed breeding farms, which resulted in the dispersion of manpower and funds, which was the biggest reason for not achieving the expected results. Therefore, this year, it was decided to adjust and merge them, especially in areas with a strong emphasis and poor security. Secondly, emphasis will be placed on promotion work, and the excellent varieties that have been successfully tested will be promoted as much as possible to achieve real production increases. In addition, this year's agricultural production increase funds have also been determined, which are about three times higher than last year.

Industrial Production Increase

Regarding industrial production increase work, the "Implementation Outline for Designated Production of Daily Necessities" has already been formulated and promulgated this year. This year, the implementation of the outline will continue to be emphasized to ensure that designated daily necessities manufacturers can produce according to the planned targets. Efforts will be made to allocate the raw materials and power needed by each factory reasonably. Mineral production increase is also a non-negligible task. At present, small mines in the Central China area are being actively developed. The Mantoushan Coal Mine recently added a new shaft. If it can be realized, this alone can increase coal production by more than 100 tons per day, which will make a great contribution to industrial coal and civilian fuel.

### Increased Production in Japan and Germany: Excellent Aircraft

Central News Agency, Lisbon, 11th -- Colonel Kant, Director of the Technical Research Institute of the U.S. Army's Terhuel Aircraft Field, warned the public on the 9th that although the U.S. military has stepped up bombing of Japan, Japanese aircraft production is still increasing. Currently, both Japan and Germany are greatly increasing the production of excellent aircraft.

### Impressions of a Tea Party at the German Embassy

— By Dan Ming, Special Correspondent for This Newspaper

In the new year of the Republic of China, Year 34 [1945], key figures in the National Government were busy preparing for new efforts. With the personnel reshuffle in the Shanghai Municipal Government, the capital instead seemed to sink into silence. Conversely, Germany, due to the renewed activity on the Western Front of the European war—Marshal Rundstedt's powerful counteroffensive on December 16th of last year revealing a new dawn of victory for the Axis powers—the German Embassy in China took advantage of the New Year festivities to host a grand tea party on January 3rd, inviting Chinese and foreign journalists to the capital. As the reporter happened to be stationed in the capital, I was naturally unwilling to miss such a meaningful international gathering.

The Residence Under the Swastika Flag

The Third Reich of Germany had, through its founding history, renewed the fate of Europe, and the situation in East Asia was also undergoing fierce changes. In the life-and-death struggle in which Asia and Europe shared a common goal, Germany's future course of action was, of course, a matter of utmost concern. Therefore, the journalists who attended the German Embassy's tea party today were very enthusiastic, almost making the Ninghai Road residence of Ambassador Welmann so crowded that one could barely breathe.

Walking into the magnificent living room, I saw a man wearing a Nazi major's uniform come out to greet me. It turned out to be Lai, who had recently arrived from Germany. One could see the spirit of a modern German soldier in him. Then, many other members of the German Embassy came forward. Worthy of note: one was an ally, Mr. Masami Kasagi, who was a secretary at the German Embassy; another was my compatriot, Mr. Wang Yuguang, who was the chief secretary of the German Embassy. Mr. Wang had served as a high-ranking official in the General Staff Headquarters during the Beijing government era and had also been an instructor at the Army University. His students and disciples had all become well-known military figures for a time. I heard that he went to Europe during the late Qing dynasty. I never expected to meet such a senior alumnus in the field of overseas study here.

Those who exchanged business cards with us included: Mr. Kordt, the German Chargé d'Affaires in China; Secretary Hördt; and Mr. Turlund, the manager of the Nanjing branch of the Transocean News Agency. Mr. Kordt studied in five European countries—Germany, Spain, Italy, England, and France—and attended six universities: Caen, Frankfurt, Barcelona, Rome, Paris, and London. Therefore, he was fluent in several languages. He later worked in the League of Nations and came to China two years ago. He is a young and promising diplomat. Mr. Turlund has been in China for a long time, having stayed in North China for an extended period. He also visited Chongqing between 1940 and 1941 and is a German journalist who is proficient in Chinese and familiar with Eastern affairs. Soon, Ambassador Welmann walked in, and Chinese and Japanese journalists also entered the room. The tea party then began.

Ambassador Welmann's Demeanor

Ambassador Welmann first gave a brief welcoming speech and introduced Deputy Military Attaché Lai to give a speech on the war situation. I heard that Mr. Welmann was over sixty years old, but his complexion was ruddy, indicating that he was a Nazi fighter full of vitality. He gave a precise report on the Rhine River front and the Hungarian front. Indeed, the stimulus given to the enemy on December 16th of last year was a turning point in the final stage of the decisive battle. During Mr. Lai's speech, he hung maps of the eastern and western fronts, showing the evolving dynamics of the war; he also distributed translated copies of the speech in Chinese and Japanese, so that even those of us who did not understand German could understand it at a glance.

Mr. Lai's speech lasted forty minutes, after which Ambassador Welmann gave a humble expression of thanks. In the midst of the enthusiastic crowd, he walked into the inner room for refreshments. The reporter was first introduced by Chargé d'Affaires Kordt to shake hands with Ambassador Welmann and offer my congratulations. In the conversation, I learned that Ambassador Welmann spoke fluent English. Later, I learned that he was one of Germany's foremost experts on England. According to Mr. Welmann, he came to China at the end of July 1943. Due to transportation difficulties, he traveled to Asia by submarine, landed in Malaysia, and then took a plane, passing through Saigon and Hainan Island to reach China. At that time, Mr. Welmann had served as the Director-General of the Political Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for many years and was an assistant to Ribbentrop. He knew that I was a reporter for the *Shen Bao* and was very pleased to talk with me, hoping that I would often visit him for friendly exchanges in the future.

Two Allied Officials

After the tea party, wine was served. The host wanted us to enjoy extremely valuable champagne and beer, accompanied by various sandwiches in the style of the famous Lu's Qingfang. At this moment, an allied official suddenly walked over and asked me, "Are you Mr. Dan Ming?" "President Chen has already told us about you, so I knew this was you!" Then, the allied official made some polite remarks.

Afterwards, I learned that the allied official was Mr. Matsuo, the Secretary of the Information Department of their embassy in China. He introduced me to Mr. An, the Director of the Information Department. Mr. An was not very tall, wore rimmed glasses, and was very robust. He looked somewhat like a Chinese and was a very fluent speaker. In addition, at this international tea party, I was able to meet many figures in China's propaganda circles, such as Mr. Fan Fugong and Ms. Li Gengsheng, who are both well-known and capable officials of the Propaganda Department. The guests and hosts talked until about six o'clock, when they departed with great pleasure. Upon leaving, I learned that Ambassador Welmann would be going to Shanghai tomorrow morning.

Editorial

### Establishment of the Shanghai Temporary Refugee Relief Association

The Shanghai Temporary Refugee Relief Association, which was organized by leaders from all walks of life in the city and public-spirited individuals, held its inaugural meeting the other day, passing its organizational charter and electing the presidium. The actual work, it is believed, will be actively launched soon.

The purpose and direction of the Association's organization are clearly stated in Article 2 of the organizational charter, which is to "handle relief for people in the Shanghai area who have encountered disasters." As Mr. Li Sihao, the initiator of the Association, said at the first preparatory meeting on December 12th of last year: "Relief work in this city is very much needed. There are two types of relief work, regular and temporary. Regular relief work is already being presided over by various charitable organizations separately. There is a great and urgent need to conduct temporary relief work." We can say more clearly that so-called temporary relief work is to adapt to the current wartime environment, where enemy aircraft may launch air raids and indiscriminate bombings at any time. Therefore, citizens who have encountered disasters should be rescued with compassion and mutual assistance. Under this goal, a strong organization is needed to take on the task of relief work. The Shanghai Temporary Refugee Relief Association was created for this task, and we cannot but place high hopes on it.

Now that the Association has been established, we have a few thoughts and opinions on this. We often say that social work should be the responsibility of social leaders to take on automatically. At the same time, while one may not be interested in political work and thus not enter officialdom, one cannot ignore social work and cannot stand idly by, because no one can live apart from society. If fair-minded people and respected leaders in society adopt a passive wait-and-see attitude, then social work will either stagnate or fall into the hands of improper people, thus creating an unstable and chaotic phenomenon in society. At this time, fair-minded people living in this society will also inevitably encounter the same unrest and will not be able to remain virtuous in isolation. On the other hand, when social work is led and carried out by fair-minded people, social undertakings are put on the right track, forming a force of righteousness. Not only will evil forces in society be unable to raise their heads, thereby stabilizing society, but it can also influence politics to enter the path of integrity and clarity. Only by actively participating in social work in this way can the original aspirations of fair-minded social leaders be realized. Otherwise, passively remaining virtuous in isolation is, in fact, impossible.

In the initiation and establishment of this Temporary Refugee Relief Association, Mr. Yan Huiqing's participation was the greatest force. Because of Mr. Yan's leadership, several other people who have rarely participated in social work in the past have also come forward to participate, which is a very gratifying thing. We look forward to social progress and the success of social undertakings. We welcome all fair-minded people of high standing and position in society to actively participate in social work. The establishment of the Temporary Refugee Relief Association is the beginning of this.

Finally, regarding the future work of the Association, we believe that the most important things are agility and integrity. When a disaster occurs, investigation must be agile, and relief must be agile. Distribution must be honest and upright, and assessment must be honest and upright. All preparations must be fully considered in advance and arranged thoroughly in order to save time and reduce the suffering of the afflicted citizens as the highest priority. We believe that under the leadership of the elected presidium, it will be possible to meet our expectations. However, the selection and employment of staff must also use the above criteria as the selection standard, so as to achieve consistency from top to bottom, like the effect of an arm being used by a finger.

Finally, from this temporary relief work, we are reminded that the regular relief work conducted by charitable organizations in the city also needs to adapt to the environment. For example, during winter relief, when rice is felt to be scarce, porridge should not necessarily use white rice as the main ingredient. Coarse grains should be used as much as possible, so that the value is cheaper and the scope of distribution can be expanded. At the same time, the quantity should also be reduced appropriately to cover a wider range. Furthermore, some charitable organizations, such as those for the elderly and infants, do not need to stay in Shanghai. In order to save expenses, they should choose to evacuate to rural areas. These are all points worth considering for those in charge of relief work.

### Germany Uses Jet Propulsion Engines on the Western Front

Berlin, 11th (Central News Agency Telegram) – During the large-scale counteroffensive of German forces on the Western European front, hundreds of new fighter planes have frequently operated in front of the anti-Axis forces and shattered the strong positions of the American First Army. The elite among these fighter squadrons is the M.C.163 jet-propelled single-engine, single-seat fighter. These M.C.163 fighter planes and the M.C.163 twin-engine jet-propelled fighter planes appeared in small numbers over the French theater last autumn. It is rumored that their speed reached over 800 kilometers per hour, causing great trouble for the British and American air forces. The German Air Force authorities have not formally announced the structure and performance of the M.C.163 aircraft, only leaving it to enemy speculation and rumors.

German Forces in the Ardennes Shorten Their Lines

Berlin, 11th (Central News Agency Telegram) – German Frontline News: The German High Command, in view of the necessities of future operations, has decided to shorten the battle lines in the Ardennes salient and is now beginning to withdraw from the road transportation hub of Saint-Vith.

Berlin, 11th (Central News Agency Telegram) – German military sources told the German News Agency: The battles between the Meuse and Moselle rivers, especially on the northern wing of that area, were even more tense on the 9th. The pressure exerted by Marshal Montgomery's units on the northern front has slightly eased. On the western side of the penetration zone, the German High Command has ordered a shortening of the lines, and therefore, troops at the Saint-Vith road junction are withdrawing daily. Offensive operations by German forces on the Saar front and in Alsace continue to make smooth progress, but details have not yet been released.

### Goods Allocation Office Stipulates Citizen Permit Instructions; Total of Thirteen Articles to be Implemented Immediately

The Goods Allocation Office, in order to ensure that citizens understand the permit procedures for the allocation of various materials, has recently stipulated thirteen articles of Citizen Permit Instructions, which will be implemented immediately. The original text is as follows:

(1) In order to ensure that citizens understand the permit procedures, this office has specially stipulated "Citizen Permit Instructions" to be distributed to the city for application. (2) Any citizen of this city who meets the following conditions may apply for a comprehensive allocation permit: 1. Original residents within the city area; 2. Those who have moved in from outside the city area; 3. Emigrants. (3) When citizens of this city apply for allocation permits, the sub-landlord or head of household or their representative should bring various household registration documents (for example, in districts 18 and 2, receipts for municipal general donations should be prepared, and receipts for monthly donations from the Baojia offices. In the districts of Nanshi, Zhabei, Xuhua, Pudong, and the city center, before the municipal general donation receipts are universally issued, application for allocation permits should be obtained from the permit issuing offices of this office, along with the permit and the household registration certificate from the Fang Office, or the household registration certificate from the police station, and citizen certificates must be verified when necessary), and go to the permit issuing office to which their district belongs on the date specified on the donation ticket or application permit. If the sub-landlord or head of household falsely reports the number of people, if this office verifies the facts, this office will handle the case according to law. (4) When a citizen moves from District A to District B, they should return the move certificate issued by the Baojia office and the unused allocation permit to the original permit issuing office, and obtain a Move Report Certificate from that office. The number of returned tickets and their numbers should be clearly filled on the back, and the permit issuing office should stamp the returned allocation permit with the words "Canceled" before handing it over to the original residence's Baojia head and sub-landlord to stamp the back of the Move Report Certificate to prove the move out. After moving to the new residence, the Baojia head and sub-landlord of the new residence should stamp the front of the Increased Allocation Permit Request Form to prove it, and then the documents, together with the canceled allocation permit, can be exchanged for the same number and period of allocation permits as the ones returned to the new residence. (For example, if a comprehensive allocation permit with numbers 31 to 60 has a total of 30 small tickets, and the citizen has used 5 small tickets in succession, then the remaining tickets from numbers 36 to 60 are a total of 35 small tickets. If the citizen exchanges 25 small tickets, the permit issuing office should exchange the same 25 small tickets to the citizen.) (5) When a citizen returns to their hometown, they should hand over the unused allocation permit, together with various residence documents, to the original permit issuing office, which will stamp it with a "Return to Hometown" rubber stamp, and the citizen will take it back for presentation to the Baojia section of the police station for verification when canceling their household registration. (6) If the population of households in each district moves into this city from outside the city area, or if there are newborn babies, the head of household or sub-landlord or their representative can bring the documents to the permit issuing offices under this office to obtain an Increased Allocation Permit Application Form, hand it over to the Baojia head and sub-landlord for certification, and then submit the move-in certificate or birth certificate to the permit issuing office for registration, and it will be issued after approval by this office. (7) Civilian schools, public hospitals, church charity organizations that are exempt from house donation in accordance with regulations must obtain a donation exemption certificate from the donation office of the Finance Bureau. Staff and elevator operators, etc., can obtain a non-taxpayer certificate from each permit issuing office with a letter of proof from their employer. The form must be filled out and handed over to the Baojia head and its person in charge in that district for certification before an application for an allocation permit can be submitted. (8) If a citizen of this city dies, the head of household or the deceased's family should, within one week, return the unused allocation permit to the original permit issuing office, along with the household registration documents, and request that the office correct the household registration. The returned allocation permit will be stamped with a "Death" rubber stamp and returned to the citizen for presentation to the Baojia section of the General Police Bureau for verification when canceling the household registration. (9) After obtaining the allocation permit, citizens should keep it properly and cut off the designated number of small tickets according to the date, allocated material name, quantity, and price stipulated in the announcement of this office, and purchase them from the designated retail stores. (10) If a citizen obtains an allocation permit and it is damaged by fire, rats, or lost due to improper storage, whether intentional or negligent, this office will not reissue or exchange it. (11) If citizens have any questions about the above articles, they can go to each permit issuing office for inquiries after 3:30 pm every day.

### Progress and Satisfaction with This Air Defense Training; Firefighting Spirit Unsatisfactory

The Citizen Air Defense Headquarters and the Fire Department have recently issued "Comments on the Thirteenth Air Defense Training" and "Fire Prevention and Firefighting," as follows:

Air Defense Comments

(Comments on the Thirteenth Air Defense Training on January 9, Year 34 of the Republic of China) (1) The enthusiasm of the personnel directly engaged in air defense training and the gradual progress of their exercises are very satisfactory. The headquarters deeply admires them. However, the uncooperative attitude of the general public has not changed to this day. (2) This time, the air defense siren was not sounded, so the alarm transmission was not thorough, and the traffic control results were not good. This was an unavoidable result, and it is hoped that thorough guidance will be given in the future. (4) During the air defense training, when enemy planes are assumed to be attacking, some people do not use air-raid shelters and other facilities, but expose their bodies on the road. It is hoped that the main points of shelter guidance will be thoroughly familiarized. (5) Some civilians do not know the alarm order for training, and they are at a loss and helpless. It can be said that they are extremely unconcerned about air defense. (6) It is a pity that the number of people who stood by and watched during the local training held in the entire area under the jurisdiction of the Huangpu Branch was unexpected. In the future, this training method will continue to be promoted, and it is hoped that citizens will actively cooperate to form a general configuration. (7) Air defense equipment is quite lacking, which is a pity. It is necessary to make rapid efforts to improve it. (8) The rapid completion of air-raid shelters is currently a matter of great urgency. Citizens should not wait for the authorities to build them, but should first equip self-use shelters and then build public air-raid shelters. (9) When electricity is stopped and the siren is not blown, the measures for alarm transmission still need to be studied carefully. (10) As for the guidance level of the training schedule, there are still many places that need to be studied. (11) The state of light control is quite poor, except for a part of the area north of the Suzhou River. During normal control, there are still many places where direct light is exposed, which is a pity. The state of vehicle ignition control is considered to be in need of improvement. This time, the results of light control are poor. It is a prejudice to attribute it solely to not releasing the siren.

This phenomenon indicates that citizens are indifferent to air defense and lack cooperation. It can be said that this is a disgrace to all citizens of Shanghai under the decisive battle. In order to strengthen the crackdown on light control violations, the police authorities will severely report and punish such people.

Fire Prevention and Firefighting

"Fire Prevention and Firefighting" Japanese people have a strong spirit of fire fighting, but the Chinese side still has shortcomings. In addition to the personnel of the fighting groups, many people who should be family fire fighters have a rather indifferent attitude, which is truly a pity. Although this is due to the incomplete battle plan, air defense and fire prevention are combat behaviors. If the fighting spirit is not full, it will be difficult to win. Therefore, this spirit must be strong.

Although fire prevention and firefighting technology has improved every time, due to the incomplete preparation for the fire fight (such as fire-fighting water and other materials), there is a regret of impracticality. Therefore, at least at the training site, it is necessary to first implement the necessary combat preparations so that a considerable effect can be obtained, which is very important.

Regarding the actions of fighters in the combat site, there are quite a few who take handing water buckets and pouring water as the golden rule. It must be known that the so-called initial fire prevention disposal after the bombing depends on each person sending water and pouring water as soon as possible, which is also very important.

Training must conform to actual warfare. Therefore, it is hoped that the instructors will plan according to the condition of the area and buildings when holding training so as to be realistic. It is not appropriate to train by showing incendiary bombs that spread to non-combustible buildings such as copper-bone cement.

Urban attack methods in modern warfare are changing all the time. Yesterday's incendiary bombs are not today's incendiary bombs, so it is not appropriate to stick to outdated tactics and repeatedly hold the same training. When showing the situation, anticipate incendiary bombs or bombs and incendiary bombs being dropped at the same time, and adapt to the situation to carry out exercises. Also, consider the situation where the fire spreads immediately after the bomb is dropped, and conduct further training.

Training must not be slack, especially for firefighters. In preparation for the second and third air raids, even if the established air defense actions have been completed, it is still necessary to engage in the replenishment of water, the inspection and preparation of machinery and equipment, and so on. At present, only the presence or absence of personnel is checked, and the above actions have not yet been implemented before completion. Therefore, everyone should consider the replenishment of water, carry out training, and make it a habit, which is highly anticipated.

### Ambassador Gu Arrives in Shanghai by Plane from Japan; Toyota Succeeds as Consul General in Shanghai

Japanese Ambassador to China Gu Zhengzhi, who had previously returned to his country to report on the situation, arrived in Shanghai by plane on the 10th. At the same time, Consul General Toyota succeeded Consul General Yano and came to Shanghai to take office.

### Sugar Special Committee Abolished; Case Files Transferred

The Sugar Professional Committee of the Commercial Unification Council, because all sugar allocation matters have been handled by the Sino-Japanese Sugar Industry Association since its establishment, the professional committee is no longer necessary to be set up. Therefore, it was ordered to end and abolish at the end of last month. All the files of the association's past control management have now been sorted out. The Commercial Unification Council sent personnel to receive them at 2:00 pm today. A part of the important sugar control case files was handed over to the Sino-Japanese Sugar Industry Association for management.

### Price Limits Assessed for Seventy Kinds of Soap

The Municipal Price Assessment Council assessed the recent price limits for 70 kinds of soap yesterday. For example, the retail price of Mingxing Riyue soap is 127.2 yuan per bar, hard soap is 113.1 yuan, Mingxing Superior soap is 114.8 yuan, Yuhua Silver Star soap is 122.2 yuan, Arrow Knife soap is 122.2 yuan, Guben soap is 123.8 yuan, Nanyang Superior soap is 123.8 yuan, Henry Yellow A-character soap is 121 yuan, Daxin Bull Brand soap is 121 yuan, etc. The above price limits are based on a weight of 405 city catties per box, a price of 13,500 yuan, and a standard of 50% fatty acid content. The quality of soaps with lower quality is reduced and assessed in direct proportion to the fatty acid content and weight.

### Relying on Our Beliefs

Hope all sectors continue to work hard to donate funds

No matter what you do, you must first have a purpose, a plan, a goal, and then have a belief; by doing it step by step, the career has the hope of success. The "Special Fundraising" launched by this newspaper is aimed at relieving the poor and out-of-school and promoting the urgent task of education to save the country, which no one can deny. Therefore, the plans and goals set are all in line with actual needs, and are by no means empty talk. And our belief is also very firm, believing that all sectors of Shanghai will definitely give enthusiastic support and promote each other, and eventually become a scholarship movement for readers of this newspaper. At the beginning of the launch, the number of teams was small and the donations were small. Many people were worried about us, thinking that it would be difficult to achieve the goal at this time, but we adhered to the past scholarship purpose, strengthened our beliefs, and gradually promoted it. Sure enough, in less than half a month, people from all walks of life, especially teachers and students from various schools, gave various support, and the results of donations met our budget. As of today, it has broken the 10 million yuan record, which can be told to the eager hope of 5,000 students. However, time is passing quickly, and school is about to start in a blink of an eye. I hope that enthusiastic people will continue to work hard and reach the predetermined goal as soon as possible, so that the 5,000 students who received assistance in the previous session will not wander off course and suffer the pain of dropping out of school, and the country and nation will rely on it!

The charity sale for scholarship is deeply appreciated

Jinling Road Yuanyuan Society and others wrote: "Directly to the opener, our colleagues donated 50,000 yuan to your newspaper's scholarship fund yesterday to celebrate the health of Master Ruoyu Xuan, and received a bottle of 'Deeply Appreciated' tonic. The colleagues were even more excited because your newspaper handles scholarships and needs urgent funds. Therefore, we held a charity sale of this precious tonic again, raising 51,000 yuan on the spot, named 'Ruoyu Health Second Team'. At the same time, Master Xuan also recognized a team at the same amount, named 'Ruoyu Health Third Team', totaling 102,000 national currency. Here is a special presentation, hoping to accept it."

Zhengxing Girls' Middle School enthusiastically helps students

Zhengxing Girls' Middle School wrote: "Respectfully opener, this time our school hosted the Zhengxing Cup First All-Shanghai Women's Individual Table Tennis Championship, with more than 30 participants.

The finals were held at 2:00 pm on the 7th of this month in the former Xiqing ball room. There was also a men's table tennis friendly match on that day, inviting He Ren to fight against Shanghai United. The performance was wonderful and caused a sensation in Shanghai. In order to respond to your newspaper's scholarship fund movement, all spectators entered the venue with tickets. Donors to the scholarship fund were given an entrance ticket. The total donation revenue was 150,000 yuan. In addition to the venue fee (10,000 yuan), all expenses were borne by our school. All donations were equally distributed to your newspaper and the News Scholarship Fund. Here is a presentation of 70,000 yuan of national currency, named 'Zhengxing Girls' Middle School Second Team, Third Team, Fourth Team, (Zhengxing Cup Finals Donation Revenue)'. I hope to accept it and ask to announce it for credibility. If people from all walks of life hear the wind and rise up, work together to expand the scholarship fund, it will be very fortunate."

### Municipal Government Public Supplies Problem

— Gu Ziqiang

The various bureaus, offices, county governments, and district offices affiliated with the municipal government number no less than thirty, and these agencies require a considerable amount of property and goods. The purchase of this property and the procurement of these goods are currently handled individually by each agency, drawing from their respective operating or temporary budgets. At this juncture, this arrangement is rife with problems. It is uneconomical in terms of both money and time, and it even affects administrative efficiency. There is an urgent need to establish a "Municipal Government Public Supplies Office." The following discussion is divided into "Property" and "Goods."

(1) Regarding Public Property: Bureaus and offices require equipment, vehicles, machinery, repair materials, construction projects, and other property. These are currently handled by first obtaining approval when needed, then submitting price quotations and preparing a budget to request funds. The procedures are numerous and time-consuming. Price increases often render the quotations invalid, making purchases difficult. On the municipal government's side, assessment and review consume significant manpower. Establishing a unified supply office could eliminate the quotation and investigation procedures, making construction more convenient. All temporary expenses of various agencies could be centrally managed.

(2) Regarding Public Goods: Office supplies used by the agencies, such as stationery, paper, pens, ink, notebooks, sundries, and printing, are currently funded from each unit's operating budget according to approved amounts. However, due to rising prices, the need for goods cannot be reduced accordingly. As a result, various agencies have repeatedly requested additional office expenses. The biggest reason is that office expenses are disbursed monthly according to the budget, preventing large-scale purchases to mitigate losses from rising prices. If the municipal government establishes a supply office in the future, the office expenses of each agency could be pooled as the supply office's capital. It could then purchase stationery, paper, pens, ink, notebooks, sundries, and printing in bulk, and distribute them to each agency according to their actual needs in terms of personnel and operations.

The Chinese postal authorities already have such an organization in place, with all postal agencies nationwide supplied by a single entity. The municipal government previously established a Purchasing and Architectural Design Committee, but its scope was too narrow, and its organization was not sound, leading to a lack of progress. It is hoped that the municipal government, during this restructuring, will establish this new organization to reduce unnecessary waste of municipal government finances and time.

### Special Rice Allocation for Teachers and Staff: Increased Ration

The rice ration for teachers and staff, previously distributed in three installments per month, has been changed by the Materials Distribution Office to two installments per month, starting this month. Although the price of household rice has increased, the authorities, to favor teachers and staff, will maintain the original price of 50 yuan per liter. Teachers and staff holding ticket number 9 can redeem their rice at designated public sales offices from the 11th to the 20th, with a quantity of 1.5 dou (approximately 15 liters), an increase compared to before. Ticket number 10 will be distributed from the 21st to the end of the month. It is also reported that judicial police holding Category C rice ration tickets will receive their rice at the same time as teachers and staff, with each ticket entitling them to 1.85 dou (approximately 18.5 liters). The dates for the distribution of Category A and B tickets will be officially announced once the authorities have finalized them.
