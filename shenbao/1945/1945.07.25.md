### Fierce Hand-to-Hand Combat Breaks Out Near Samarinda Road; Enemy Continues to Reinforce Northwest of Balikpapan

Pacific Base, 24th (Central News Agency) – Enemy forces in the Balikpapan area have received reinforcements. On the 21st, they bombarded Japanese front-line positions with mortars and field guns. Approximately one enemy company in several detachments attacked, but the Japanese forces repelled them all. On the 22nd, the enemy continued its offensive, and fierce fighting is currently underway between both sides. The Japanese forces inflicted approximately 330 casualties on the enemy on the 21st and 22nd.

Southern Front Base, 24th (Central News Agency) – On the Balikpapan front, a temporary stalemate had previously existed. However, since the 20th, fierce fighting between Japanese and American forces has resumed near the Samarinda Road. Japanese garrison units engaged in hand-to-hand combat against enemy defects, launching strong assaults on enemy positions, causing them great damage. On the 22nd, a portion of the enemy forces began landing reinforcements using five small boats near Tambaton, 21 kilometers northwest of Balikpapan.

### Japanese Forces Inflict Heavy Damage on Enemy in Surprise Attack

Southern Front Base, 24th (Central News Agency) – The enemy is attempting to recapture the oil field area of Balikpapan, but is being held back by the Japanese deep defense positions along the Samarinda Road and cannot advance. Recently, the enemy has been clearing the dense forests on both sides of the road, attempting to press closer to Japanese positions. Currently, the battle lines of the two armies facing each other eight kilometers from Samarinda are only 50 to 15 meters apart. Taking advantage of this, from the 10th to the 20th, the Japanese forces dispatched suicide squads to charge into enemy positions, annihilating over 200 enemy soldiers and depleting their combat strength. For example, Japanese soldiers Okamoto and two others, during the battle of Mount Kasayama, carried landmines and charged into an enemy formation only 40 meters away, ultimately destroying two enemy tanks. Furthermore, Japanese Lance Corporal Hayashi destroyed an enemy heavy tank with a landmine. Additionally, three Japanese sentries attacked an enemy group with explosive charges, killing and wounding 50 enemy soldiers in one fell swoop. The Kamai Unit carried out a hand-to-hand combat assault against an enemy company north of the water source defense area. Ten brave warriors, including Sergeant First Class Nakamura Asaichi, infiltrated the enemy's rear, killing 15 enemy soldiers and capturing the enemy's position. In addition, the Kamai Unit opened fire on the Sembalia oilfield hills, annihilating an accompanying enemy company. Furthermore, a commando unit led by Captain Komine skillfully and rapidly attacked an enemy position and destroyed seven enemy artillery vehicles, displaying courageous and daring combat, causing extreme terror to the enemy.

### Enemy Naval Forces Agitated in Southern Waters; Enemy Movement Observed; 30 Enemy Aircraft Shot Down/Destroyed in Attack on Kure Port

Tokyo, 24th (Central News Agency) – The enemy's mobile forces intruded into Japanese coastal waters on the 10th of this month, primarily using carrier-based aircraft to bomb various areas from Kanto northward to Hokkaido. Subsequently, the mobile forces bombed various areas of Japan, while still patrolling the waters near the mainland, appearing and disappearing unpredictably. Currently, they are gradually moving towards the sea south of the Japanese mainland. On the 24th, activity began west of the Tokai region. On the 24th, the enemy's operations were not limited to carrier-based aircraft. The enemy's small aircraft, in addition to carrier-based aircraft, also included approximately 1,000 P-51s, and 600 B-29 heavy bombers were deployed, implementing fully coordinated operations between carrier air power and land-based air power. At the start of this Three-Headed Conference, the enemy had already begun its plan to bomb the Japanese mainland with 1,000 aircraft, clearly containing a political propaganda intention. It is anticipated that the enemy will launch a full-scale tactical air operation thereafter, and this point requires careful vigilance.

Tokyo, 24th (Central News Agency) – At 6:00 AM on the 24th, approximately 200 enemy B-29 and P-51 aircraft, and 170 carrier-based aircraft, in small formations, attacked the Inland Sea area and the Kure region, primarily strafing air bases and small vessels sailing within the area with machine guns. At 9:30 AM, the second wave of enemy carrier-based aircraft, in a combined formation of approximately 200 fighter-bombers, intruded into the Kure region, primarily attacking ships within the port. As of 1:00 PM, the results confirmed that Japanese anti-aircraft fire shot down and destroyed 30 enemy aircraft.

### Cruel Actions

Tokyo, 24th (Central News Agency) – Recently, B-29s and small enemy aircraft have attacked small and medium-sized cities, resulting in a significant number of deaths and injuries, especially among women and children. This situation is noteworthy. This is partly due to insufficient effort in civil air defense, but on the other hand, it is also because the enemy specifically targets civilians to inflict casualties as quickly as possible. Here are a few examples to prove this: When Kofu City was attacked by enemy aircraft, the enemy first dropped incendiary bombs on the mountains near the surrounding difficult areas, carrying out indiscriminate bombing, making it impossible for citizens to escape, and then bombed the city again. When enemy aircraft attacked Shimizu City, they also adopted the same tactic, using flames to block the mountains and coastline before massacring civilians. In Hiratsuka City, enemy aircraft dropped bombs when they discovered refugees gathered in a nearby pine forest.

### Japanese Railway Volunteer Corps Reorganized into Combat Unit

Tokyo, 24th (Central News Agency) – According to a statement by the Japanese Ministry of the Army, an order was issued on July 23rd to reorganize the Railway Volunteer Corps into the Railway Combat Unit.

### U.S. Air Force in Europe Transferred to Pacific

Tokyo, 23rd (Central News Agency) – According to a report from London, the U.S. Army Air Forces in Europe announced on the 22nd that eight percent of the U.S. Army's bombers and fighters in Europe had been transferred to the Pacific Theater.

Lisbon, 24th (Central News Agency) – According to a report from Uruguay, General Doolittle, commander of the U.S. Eighth Air Force, arrived at a large Pacific air base on the 23rd.

Lisbon, 24th (Central News Agency) – According to a report from Manila, the first group of over 5,000 U.S. troops transferred from the United States to the island arrived in Manila yesterday, most of whom were engineer units.

### Japanese Army Units in Philippines Achieve Great Merits; Japanese Ministry of the Army Announced the Day Before Yesterday

Tokyo, 24th (Central News Agency) – The Japanese Ministry of the Army announced on July 23rd that since January 9th of this year, various Japanese units in the Philippines have achieved great merits in the various battles in the Philippines. They were awarded commendations by the highest Japanese army commander in the Philippines, which were subsequently reported to His Majesty the Emperor. The various units and their accomplishments are listed below:

"Shoji Unit and its Subordinate Units" Under the command of Captain Shoji, since the enemy landed in Lingayen Gulf on January 9th, the unit has repeatedly attacked enemy coastal forces, inflicting heavy damage. It also launched surprise attacks on the enemy's landing base at night, annihilating a large number of enemy soldiers and destroying a large amount of enemy supplies. Furthermore, the unit lured superior enemy forces to the front of Japanese positions and launched a fierce attack, causing them to collapse. Afterwards, although the enemy strengthened their forces, they wanted to sneak attack the Japanese rear positions, but they retreated upon seeing that the unit was heavily guarded. At the end of January, the entire unit launched a heroic hand-to-hand attack, and展开頑强之週擊戰予以重创后,归还原防.

"Sawada Unit and Attached Units" Under the command of Army Captain Sawada Hiroo, the unit met the enemy forces landing in Lingayen Gulf and inflicted heavy damage on the enemy using superior Japanese tactics. Since January 10th, when the enemy besieged the heights held by the unit with fierce artillery fire, the officers and soldiers of the unit suffered casualties and ammunition ran out, but the unit still fought bravely. In the end, only five members of the entire army remained, including the company commander, but they still secured the heights, preventing the enemy from advancing.

"Sato Engineer Corps" Under the command of Army Captain Sato Shinichi, the unit bravely launched surprise attacks on the enemy landing forces since January 9th. From January 16th to the 20th, the unit repeatedly attacked the enemy base, destroying many important enemy weapons, tank ammunition depots, etc., and reducing their base, achieving great results. Subsequently, since January 20th, the unit has penetrated the enemy's positions with a small number of soldiers, killing hundreds of enemy soldiers with flamethrowers and landmines. At the same time, the unit quickly deployed landmines to hinder enemy tank movements, making great contributions.

"Fujishige Unit and Assigned Units" Under the command of Army Captain Sato Shigemasa, the unit inflicted heavy damage on the enemy landing forces since January 20th. With flexible actions, the unit擊減了敵軍之空挺部隊, at the same time, the unit contained the enemy with a small number of soldiers, hindering its advance towards Manila. Although the team was repeatedly besieged and attacked by enemy forces, it still fought bravely, inflicting heavy damage on the enemy.

"Hasegawa Assault Team" Under the command of Army Lieutenant Hasegawa Harumitsu, on February 6th, the team broke through the enemy's heavy cordon, disrupting enemy transportation routes and destroying enemy camps. On the way, the unit attacked the enemy's food storage and cut off the enemy's communication network, and destroyed many vehicles, inflicting heavy damage.

"Nishimura Unit" Under the command of Army Captain Nishimura Isamu, on January 16th, the entire army launched a surprise attack on the enemy landing base, and annihilated it. Since January 31st, due to the great disparity between the Japanese and American forces, the commanders and soldiers below the unit commander were successively killed in battle. However, the surviving soldiers continued to defend Hill 463 for a long time.

"Kurasai Artillery Platoon" Under the command of Army Sergeant Kurasai, the unit inflicted heavy damage on the enemy. Subsequently, due to the fierce enemy artillery fire, the Japanese army suffered casualties, but the morale of the soldiers below the platoon commander was high, and they annihilated hundreds of enemy troops, and destroyed artillery tanks and other military supplies. In湾之，一月十九日復前進，對敵展開反一攻，以殘餘之大砲一鬥，　敵集中砲火勇敢奮戰，終至彈藥罄盡，而全隊壯

Editorial

### Schools Should Prepare for Evacuation

We have discussed the issue of school evacuation several times, and as early as a few months ago, we pointed out the necessity of school evacuation. However, to date, we have not seen any discussion or preparation by the school authorities and the Education Bureau. Perhaps all parties concerned believe that implementing evacuation presents numerous difficulties, such as the selection of evacuation destinations, the rental and arrangement of school buildings, the settlement of teaching staff, students' attendance at schools, the relocation of school equipment and instruments, and the acquisition of transportation, all of which are problems that arise immediately and need to be solved simultaneously. Because of these practical problems, perhaps the school authorities, although they have the intention to evacuate, do not have the determination to implement it.

Indeed, implementing school evacuation does have various problems and is quite difficult. However, we must recognize why we need to evacuate. It is undeniable that the environment is prompting us to implement evacuation. In order to continue to bear the responsibility of education, and to do its utmost to rapidly cultivate talent to participate in the reconstruction, we must not allow the education to be interrupted. Under this sacred mission and task, any difficulties and any obstacles must be eliminated with determination and courage. Moreover, the problems that school evacuation currently raises are not very difficult. We believe that the education and school authorities only need to not let a complacent mentality take precedence, but to rise up with the courage that evacuation is essential. Then, even if there are any difficult problems, they can be solved easily. We would like to further elaborate as follows:

The main conditions for the issue of evacuation destinations are that they must not be key military locations, and the cities and towns where the local customs are simple and the standard of living is relatively low are appropriate. Security is secondary, because schools are not production or profit-making agencies. Places such as Dongting Mountain Jiaozhi are all possible.

Regarding the issue of renting and arranging school buildings, according to on-the-spot investigations by various parties, there are appropriate vacant houses in the above-mentioned places, such as temples and ancestral halls, which can be converted. As long as they are not soaked by rain and can avoid wind, simplicity will be greatly appreciated, and the spirit of overcoming matter should be fully promoted in the teaching and reading life.

The issue of settling teaching staff is easier to solve. The biggest expense in current living expenses is meals, and the family living burden of school teaching staff also feels most threatened by the meal expense. If schools evacuate to the countryside, meal expenses will inevitably be cheaper than in Shanghai. In terms of solving the family living burden and in terms of safety, I believe that no teaching staff would be unwilling to evacuate with the school.

Regarding the issue of whether students should attend schools, according to general speculation, parents will never want their children to drop out of school, and at the same time, they will worry about the safety of their children. If schools evacuate to safe areas, there is no doubt that parents will be willing to send their children to schools.

The issue of relocating school equipment and instruments and transportation. School equipment and instruments need to be relocated selectively, and we believe that the evacuation committee will be responsible for assisting and will be able to satisfy the school authorities.

We believe that the difficulties that school authorities raise about school evacuation can all be solved to a considerable extent, and the problem lies in the school authorities' own determination and boldness. However, the fact that this city has been subjected to enemy blind bombing for consecutive days is obvious, and it is expected that it will become more and more intense in the future. We must not have a complacent mentality and ask for trouble ourselves. Individuals who do not need to stay in Shanghai and charitable organizations should evacuate as soon as possible, and schools, especially universities, colleges, and large secondary schools, should also be prepared to evacuate as soon as possible.

In this extraordinary period, there should be extraordinary determination and courage to overcome all difficulties and create a new environment. We expect this from education and school authorities. In short, the next semester should prepare for how to evacuate, not how to start school. We hope you pay attention to this.

### Japanese Special Service Soldiers – Honorable Commendation

Fukuoka, 24th (Central News Agency) – A Japanese military unit, over a year from June 16th of last year to the 10th of this month, invited and attacked the U.S. Air Force from the Mariana Islands and enemy mobile units on the Chinese mainland, achieving the result of shooting down and destroying approximately 200 enemy aircraft. On May 7th of this year, when enemy B29 aircraft from the Mariana base attacked the Japanese mainland, Aoki Minoru and Kaneko Ryoichi, two sergeants of the Japanese Dragon Slayer Air Corps,突人敵機十一架之一編隊, each destroyed one enemy aircraft over the Bungo Channel. Unfortunately, they were hit and self-destructed. On the 22nd, the military commander conveyed the above-mentioned special service soldiers to them.

### 200 U.S. Aircraft Attack Zhoushan Island

Tokyo, 24th (Central News Agency) – Approximately 100 enemy B-25 and B-24 aircraft, and approximately 100 P-38 escort fighters, attacked Zhoushan Island in broad daylight on the 23rd. The Japanese army immediately invited them to attack, shooting down six and destroying four.

### Japanese Forces Launch Counterattack on West Bank of Xi Tang River; Burmese War Turns Tense

Burma Base, 24th (Central News Agency) – Since the Japanese army launched a counterattack on the west bank of the Xi Tang River, which has lasted for two sentences, the entire front line from Kalaw Lawi Um to the east of Donggua has suddenly become tense. After the retreat of the British army near Bigu, the citizens have shown a growing lack of trust in the British army. Therefore, the enemy has been publicizing daily that powerful reinforcements have arrived. It also publicized that the defense is complete and there is no need to worry, in order to prevent civil unrest. The situation is extremely embarrassing.

Travel Communication

### Trip to Fengxian

Fengxian has a vast area, and the plains are endless. To the southeast of the station, it is connected to the seawall, and to the northwest and south, it is adjacent to Nanhui Zhongjiang and Songjiang. The county government has been moved several times, and in the first year of the Republic, it was moved to Nanqiao Town. The county has well-developed transportation and relatively prosperous commerce, with many agencies, making it the political and commercial center of Fengxian. The entire territory is divided into five districts, five towns, and forty-three townships. Each district has a total of 56,004 households, with approximately 239,000 people.

Most of the people make a living by farming and weaving, supplemented by commerce. The folk customs value learning and honor the past. The Jishe in the late Ming Dynasty was at its peak. Although it has declined somewhat today, independent scholars still occasionally emerge.

### Situation Along the Way

There are two routes from the urban area to Nanqiao: one is Pier 13 on the Bund, taking the Jinshan liner, going west along the Huangpu River to Minhang, crossing the river and then taking a long-distance bus directly to Nanqiao Town; the other is to take a private car on Xietu Road, passing the Shanghai-Min Road to Minhang, then crossing the river and taking a bus via Minnan Road to the entrance of the town. The former liner often stops to load and unload goods along the way, taking four or five hours to reach Minhang. In the early summer heat, it is even more difficult to travel due to the small boat and large number of people. The latter is more expensive, but the entire journey takes only within two hours. Therefore, the reporter舍此而

At nine in the morning, the car departed from Xietu Road and reached Minhang Town in about an hour. The car passes through the Shanghai-Min Road, which is very bumpy. The road surface is worst in front and behind Zhuanqiao Town. Every ten feet, there must be a pool. When the wheels pass through this, they sink three or four inches. The car travels in between, like a boat sailing in the torrent of turbulent waves. There is an endless stream of cyclists and rice sellers along the way. It is said that their destinations are various villages and towns near Nanqiao.

Crossing the river from Minhang costs 500 per passenger and 300 for self-service, and the price is negotiable if there is rice on the car. It takes only 15 minutes to take a bus to Nanqiao Town because the highway is flat.

### Strict Security

Since the Qingxiang, public security has gradually recovered, but the county is vast, and public security in rural areas has not reached the standard of satisfactory. In areas such as Tuomo,　付未靖, they hide to plot, especially in the coastal area, which is often a haunt for criminals. Although the local garrison has repeatedly swept it away, the east窜西突. 余　未淸, 近復變木加厲，嘯緊日衆，每東夜問，持械侵入民家，肆　物資，地方安寧，受極大之威脅.

The towns currently have policemen and security teams stationed locally, sharing the responsibility of maintaining public security. At the same time, there are Japanese military police organs that coordinate with them at any time and do their best to defend. When the reporter arrived in town, they were增問 by plainclothes detectives in two hours, from which刻见其　备严密的一斑。

In order to supplement what cannot be accomplished by heavy armament, strong men are assembled from all townships to organize self-defense groups, operate in coordination with each other, and watch out for each other. During the slack season, they undergo military training to form security reserve teams to assist the police in protecting their hometowns in case of an alarm.

### Market Scene

The markets in the town are most prosperous in the North-South Avenue and Zhongshi in Nanqiao. Old Zhi Fengcheng is small and desolate, and there are no shops of any scale to see. In Nanqiao Town, from morning to evening, merchants never cease. Farmers from villages and towns come to sell materials, exchange for daily necessities and return. The burdens of general stores are heavy, so their prices are more expensive than in Shanghai. Even if you take a restaurant, the expenditure of one person eating one dish and one soup is nearly 20,000.

The county's financial institutions include the Puzuo Agricultural Bank and Xianghe Money House. Recently, the discount rate for bills has been very high, and the issuance of appropriation orders has caused many abuses. It is said that a certain money house in the town started operating without obtaining a license, and recently滥发不兑现之本票, encroaching on the national currency issuance right, exceeding the capital by dozens of times, causing chaos in the market and anxiety among the people. At this stage of intense warfare, in order to stabilize people's livelihood, the authorities should follow the laws and regulations of the Ministry of Finance, pay attention at any time, and strictly crack down on it.

### Rice Cotton and Miscellaneous Grains

According to a survey by the Tianfu Office, the county has 585,800 mu of arable land, of which approximately 200,000 mu are paddy fields, mostly in the western township, and the rest are dry land, mostly in the eastern township. Paddy fields are suitable for planting rice, but the climate is earlier, so seeds must be soaked during Qingming,　雨插秋, so there are hundreds of days of rice, sixty days of rice and other names, and now there are fifty days of rice. The western countryside　水差易, and the harvest is abundant. Recently, due to public security reasons in rural areas, the output is far less than before, and every year food depends on the supply of neighboring counties such as Songjin. Although the number of households planting rice has increased, it has not yet reached the point of self-sufficiency.

历年催政田赋，约在九成以上，稍此于　　申江. Since June 1,改征寶物，第一期三成。 In terms of crops, cotton has always been the main crop. Before the incident, the annual cotton output was more than 200,000 dan, which was a major export product, with annual sales reaching millions. In recent years, the price of cotton has been lower than the price of rice, and most farmers have changed cotton to rice, so the past盛况已成历史陈迹.

靑村产　, and the manufactured fishing nets are profitable for the fishermen. The coastal waters that do not reach the tide do not produce　卤, which was all abandoned in the past. Now, due to the soaring rice prices, miscellaneous grains驟　重要地位, farmers have begun to use wasteland to increase the planting of sweet potatoes, maize, and beans. Only the coastal sandy land is very vast,时　　　期内，未加　植，殊属可惜

### Education and Culture

The organization of education and culture suffered immense damage during the invasion period. School buildings were destroyed, or school equipment was lost entirely. Although years have passed with various forms of assistance leading to a slight recovery, due to a lack of talent and funding, rural education remains backward, and out-of-school children are scattered across the countryside. Considering the current situation in the entire county, there is one junior middle school, twelve model primary schools and complete primary schools, and sixty-nine junior primary schools, with a total of only over seven thousand seven hundred students. In addition to subsidies from the local authorities, school operating expenses are also supplemented by an appropriate increase in rice for education. As for the salaries of teachers and staff, although they have been nominally increased tenfold according to living conditions, they still cannot keep up with the rapid rise in prices. Therefore, teachers' lives remain difficult.

To restore the former state of affairs, it is planned to add one central primary school in each district of the county as a model, and to prepare for the establishment of a normal school in a suitable central location to cultivate teachers, who will be assigned to serve in various schools, in order to popularize education.

### Social Welfare

The cooperative was established in September of the thirty-first year [of the Republic, i.e., 1942], with branches in Qingcun, Fengcheng, Zhuangxing, and other places. Since last year, the sources of daily consumer goods have decreased sharply, and rationing has stopped. The cooperative collects various items such as hemp seeds and horse grass to exchange for supplies such as matches and soap from the Shanghai Showa Trading Company for rationing purposes. Currently, the cooperative plans to establish a trust business to lend money to farmers.

After the incident [presumably referring to the outbreak of war], all charitable organizations were suspended. In the spring of the thirty-first year, the Relief and Aid Affairs Committee was established, reorganizing public property as a foundation to successively restore orphanages, educational funds, vocational training centers for vagrants, nursing homes, and baby nurseries. Recently, local enthusiastic philanthropists and merchants, such as Xie Kexiang, and the abbot of Eryan Temple, the Reverend Xin Fu, established a free clinic at the Ancient Buddha Pavilion on North Street in Nanqiao to benefit the poor and sick. The county hospital and clinic are also being gradually constructed, with the aim of improving social welfare day by day.

### Plague Spreads in Chongqing and Chengdu

Central News Agency Dispatch - According to information from this city [Shanghai], the plague is rampant in Chongqing, with several deaths among citizens every day. According to reports from Chongqing, the plague began spreading from June 3 and quickly spread throughout the city. The Chongqing Xinmin Daily reported that citizens were terrified of the plague. By mid-June, the epidemic had further expanded, with an estimated dozens of deaths. However, the evening edition of the Ta Kung Pao on June 18 stated that on the morning of the Dragon Boat Festival, dozens of corpses were taken outside Linjiangmen, all because they could not afford coffins. The evening edition of the Xinmin Daily on June 26 also published a similar report, stating that the corpses were thrown into the river. The Xinmin Daily further claimed on the same day that the serious outbreak of cholera was due to the criminal activities of the Chongqing Kuomintang secret service, who forcefully cut off water and electricity, making it difficult to supply water. The general public had to drink unclean water, and some people even sold water on the streets, filling buckets with sewage from ditches. All of these factors were the main cause of the epidemic. However, Wang Zuxiang, Director of the Chongqing Health Bureau, claimed that it was acute gastroenteritis and not contagious. Only when the number of deaths increased did they begin injecting vaccines. At the same time, many medical institutions refused to inject citizens with vaccines, citing a shortage of vaccines. However, according to a medical professional, the vaccine reserves were abundant and there was no shortage. The recent shortage on the market was clearly due to someone hoarding them.

Guangzhou, 24th (Central News Agency) - According to Chongqing Radio, since the discovery of true cholera in Chengdu in June, as of July 21, a total of 257 deaths had been confirmed. The spread is intensifying day by day, and another type of cholera has been discovered, characterized by nausea without vomiting and diarrhea, and numbness in the limbs, but not fatal. On the 23rd, the authorities convened an expanded epidemic prevention meeting to promote epidemic prevention and discuss relief measures, deciding that the provincial infectious disease hospital and the municipal hospital should admit cholera patients free of charge, with all expenses subsidized by the provincial and municipal governments.

### Water and Land Transportation Restored Between Hangzhou and Wuxing, Security Along the Way Improving

Hangzhou, 24th (Central News Agency) - The section of Zhejiang Province from Hangzhou to Wuxing (Huzhou) had its water and land transportation interrupted for a long time due to unrest. Recently, through the joint efforts of Governor Ding and the Pacification Director, and the assignment of stationed troops and security teams to actively suppress bandits, the bandits along the waterways and highways of Taihu Lake have been gradually eliminated, and all water and land transportation has been restored. In order to conduct a thorough investigation, Governor Ding, who also serves as the Pacification Director, specially dispatched Zhang, Chief of Staff of the Pacification Director's Office, and Zhang Juansheng, Director of Civil Affairs, to visit and inspect, accompanied by Watanabe, the liaison officer. They departed from Hangzhou and arrived in Wuxing via Deqing, and have already returned to Hangzhou. It is reported that water transportation between Hangzhou and Huzhou has indeed been fully restored, and many people along the way have returned to their hometowns, with the security situation improving daily. As for the highway, Governor Ding has instructed the responsible departments to rush to repair it, and it should be passable soon.

### Drought in the Northwest

Central News Agency Dispatch - According to news from this city, the drought situation in Northwest China is severe. According to the Chongqing Saodang Daily of the 23rd of this month, Gansu is the worst affected, with no rainfall in May and June. The disaster area accounts for four-fifths of the province, with about four million people affected. Grain prices are rising daily, with the price of flour increasing sevenfold in February. Shaanxi Province is also suffering from drought, with withered wheat crops. The disaster area includes sixty counties. Since Gansu had no rain before April, the general public was very worried about food and repeatedly requested relief from the authorities.

### New Courts Established in the Soviet Occupation Zone of Berlin

Central News Agency Dispatch - According to a TASS Berlin dispatch: The "People's Newspaper" revealed that the Soviet Military Government in Berlin announced that new courts have been established in the occupied zone. Each district of Berlin will have a first-instance branch court, which will be under the jurisdiction of the court and will handle various appeals. When handling cases, each court will be based on German law prior to 1933. The main principle regarding the establishment of the court is that the judges must be genuine anti-fascists and able to make every effort to eradicate Nazi spirit and be figures who have gained the trust of the people.

### Details of Pétain's Trial in Paris Court, Old General Remains Calm

Paris, 24th (Central News Agency) - According to news from Paris yesterday: Former French Head of State, the old General Pétain, is being tried in the Paris Court on the dual charges of "harming the country and colluding with the enemy." He did not answer any questions and said sternly, "This court is not representative of the will of the entire French people, so I will not answer any questions." The former head of state wore a general's uniform with the Verdun Medal on his chest. He stood up solemnly and stated in a firm tone the reason for his silence: "The power we have is given by the entire French people, so I now make a statement to the French people. When General de Gaulle continued his efforts to fight, I was doing everything to make France free and liberated, keeping the wounded and divided France intact. If you convict me, it is tantamount to imposing a sentence on an innocent person. I entrust myself to the hands of the entire French people." At that time, the sound of whistles in the court was loud, and the trial had to be interrupted. Most defense lawyers believed that the court could not sentence Pétain, nor could it place Pétain under interrogation under Article 1875 of the Constitution. Judge Sicnart, who insisted on sentencing the former head of state to death, accused Pétain of no longer being able to use the terms set by the French Republic as a shield, because Pétain had trampled on the French Republic. Soon the trial resumed. Under heavy guard, Pétain returned to the court. Witness Rip also attended at the same time. The two met, and their eyes met as if they had met for the first time. The trial officially began eight minutes after Pétain entered. Pétain maintained his calm and silent attitude. He looked around at the questioning lawyer and asked, "How long will this trial last?" It was half past twelve in the afternoon, and many leaders of the French Republic (who were all present as witnesses) were late. When the clerk shouted "Defendant Pétain, stand up," Pétain trembled and stood up from his seat.

### Reading the Indictment

The clerk then loudly read the prosecutor's indictment: "After Lebrun resigned on June 16, 1940, President Lebrun summoned Pétain to form a cabinet, because he was threatened by General Weygand, and some members of the cabinet wanted to follow Pétain. At the same time, considering that the war against Germany could not last, Pétain negotiated an armistice with Germany after forming a cabinet. Finally, the armistice agreement was signed on June 22, causing three-fifths of the French territory to fall into the hands of the Germans, and the entire French navy was placed under German management." The indictment also recorded how Pétain moved the capital to Vichy and maintained contact with Laval, and how the French upper and lower houses gave Pétain the power to enact a new constitution. However, Pétain used his power to exceed the power granted by the two houses, and also showed a conspiracy to destroy France, announcing three new constitutions. After the indictment was finished, Pétain said sternly, "The court is not representative of the will of the entire French people, so I will not answer any questions." He continued, "I led France to victory in the most tragic period of history, so the entire France tends to me. As for the request for an armistice, I really wanted to build a great cause to liberate France. I tried my best to protect the French people. For the sake of the entire French people, I would rather sacrifice my personal prestige. At the same time, my position forced me to issue various declarations. The revival of France is based on the foundation I laid. I have only the unity of France and the revival of France in my mind. I represent French culture, Christianity to seek forgiveness. If you sentence me, this kind of judgment will be the last judgment in the world. I entrust myself to the hands of the entire French people." The court was noisy again, and the defense lawyer accused the prosecutor of holding a prejudice. Finally, the prosecutor declared, "If there is clear evidence, Pétain can be sentenced to death." The order in the court gradually returned to normal, and the trial was adjourned.

### Soviet Arms Factories Need to Produce for Civilian Needs

Stockholm, 24th (Central News Agency) - According to a Moscow dispatch: After the restoration of peace in Europe, Soviet industry has begun to produce for civilian use. Not only are civilian factories changing from wartime production to peacetime production, but also military factories such as factories that manufacture aircraft, artillery shells, and automobiles are also changing to civilian use. For example, one of the largest factories manufacturing fighter jets has now stopped producing aircraft and is producing bicycles. The former ordnance factory produced 95,000 guns during the war and is now producing industrial supplies. The tank factory in the Urals produced 35,000 tanks during the war and is now producing train wheels. Another factory in the Urals, which produced equipment for iron refineries during the war and also produced tanks, is now a large-scale steel banner production factory. Many workers in civilian and military factories now work eight hours a day.

### One Hundred Enemy Planes Attacked Shanghai Yesterday, Five Shot Down, Eleven Destroyed, Our Losses Minor

The Shanghai Municipal Japanese Army and Navy Air Defense Headquarters announced at 5:00 PM on the 24th: From 10:30 AM to 12:30 PM today (the 24th), enemy fighter-bombers of the P24, B25, and P51 types, totaling approximately 100 aircraft, in several waves, invaded the Shanghai area, mainly bombing airfields around the city. The results were five shot down (one unconfirmed) and eleven destroyed. Our losses were minor.

### Civilian Houses in the Central District Also Bombed

Also, it is reported that the city encountered another air raid at 10:00 AM yesterday, with about 100 enemy planes repeatedly bombing the outskirts of the city, but the bombs all fell on wasteland and open spaces, causing little damage. At around 11:00 AM, enemy planes again formed squadrons and attacked the city, bombing the residential areas of citizens in the central and southern districts. Several bombs hit civilian houses in Huangpu District, Yimiao District, and other places, destroying them. Personnel from the Shanghai Municipal Civil Air Defense Headquarters Rescue Department and other civil air defense personnel drove to the scene and, with the cooperation of the military authorities and the police stations and Baojia self-defense teams in each district, bravely rescued the victims. The wounded were sent to nearby hospitals for emergency treatment, and the corpses were transported by the Pushan Villa to designated locations to await identification. The details of the damage are still under investigation. At the bombed area in Huangpu District, police officers from the Laozha Police Station and the Baojia self-defense team helped with the rescue and maintained order. The air defense authorities expressed their great appreciation for their efforts. As for the victims whose houses were destroyed and who had no homes to return to, the Baojia authorities and relief organizations are taking measures to accommodate and provide relief.

### Secretary-General Luo Inspects Disaster Areas

Yesterday (the 24th) at around 10:00 AM, enemy planes again attacked various districts of the city in batches, and blindly dropped bombs in Huangpu District and Yimiao District, destroying many shops and houses in Huangpu District, killing and injuring dozens of people. In addition, more than a dozen shops along the street were shattered. Several houses were destroyed in Yimiao District, and several people were killed and injured. Upon receiving the report, Shanghai Special Municipal Government Secretary-General Luo led Deputy Director Man of the Police Bureau and others to inspect the above two places at 12:30 PM, inquired about the casualties, and supervised the rescue workers to bravely rescue the victims. He returned to the city government at around 1:00 PM.

### Citizens Pay Attention to Machine Gun Stray Bullets

Also, when enemy planes bombed overhead, they also strafed with machine guns, and bullets flew everywhere. Generally, unemployed citizens often idly watch on the streets during air raids, or even go upstairs to watch, which is extremely dangerous. Stray bullets often affect people. Therefore, the air defense authorities strongly hope that citizens will pay close attention and absolutely not engage in the above-mentioned situations to avoid unexpected accidents. Also, when the civilian houses in the central and southern districts were bombed this time, fortunately, the citizens there had already taken appropriate shelter in appropriate places, so there were very few deaths and injuries. It is still hoped that citizens will also pay attention to air defense measures in the future to maintain safety.

### Bureau of Economic Affairs: Consolidation of Permit Issuing Offices

Address also to be Changed

The Municipal Bureau of Economic Affairs, in view of the large number of permit issuing offices established in the past, the high cost of operations, and the difficulties in management, had long considered separating and consolidating them. Recently, with the completion of the 61st to 90th rounds of integrated rationing, personnel reductions were ordered in response to the call for streamlining, with the aim of reducing expenses and achieving practical results. The bureau has now decided to consolidate the original twenty-four offices into eight. Specifically, the original 1st, 2nd, and 3rd offices are combined into the 1st Issuing Office, located at 110 Jiangning Road; the 4th, 5th, and 6th are combined into the 2nd Issuing Office, located at 788 Zhabei Road; the 8th, 9th, 22nd, and 23rd are combined into the 3rd Issuing Office, located at 456 Wanan Road; the 10th, 11th, 12th, and 21st are combined into the 4th Issuing Office, located at 271 Changyang Road; the 13th, 14th, and 15th are combined into the 5th Issuing Office, located at 2 Nanhai Road; the 7th, 16th, and 20th are combined into the 6th Issuing Office, temporarily located at 2 Nanhai Road; and the 17th, 18th, and 19th are combined into the 7th Issuing Office, located on Nan Shi [district] Lailai Road. The 24th office is renamed the 8th Issuing Office, and its location remains at 260 Pudong Gaohang. All citizens are advised to note the changes of address of the various issuing offices. It is reported that approximately two hundred people, including those internally laid off due to the reorganization, will be affected by this adjustment.

### Four Silversmiths Fined for Tax Evasion

Article 4, paragraph 1, of the Provisional Regulations on Special Consumption Taxes on Goods Sold Separately by the Ministry of Finance clearly stipulates that gold, silver, and their finished products should be subject to the luxury goods tax rate for special consumption tax collection. However, the silversmiths in this city have not been collecting the special tax on the old gold purchased at their stores when it is melted into gold bars and sold. Recently, the Bureau of Finance audited the account books of various silversmiths for a certain period and found that Biaotian Shili Ji Silversmith, Yang Qinghe Fa Ji Silversmith, Qiu Tian Dou De Ji Silversmith, and Lao Tian Dou Silversmith at 723 Taishan Road had not collected the special tax on the gold bars they sold. The amount of tax evaded ranged from 18.9 million yuan to 5.6 million yuan, a considerable sum. The Bureau of Finance has ordered the silversmiths to compensate for the full amount of the tax evaded and imposed penalties in accordance with the regulations. They have also been notified of a deadline for payment, or enforcement will be carried out.

### Shop Fined for Embezzling Special Tax

The Kong Maria Shop, located at No. 405 within No. 370 North Suzhou Road in this city, opened in September of last year and closed down at the end of December due to poor business. However, the shop did not report the cessation of business to the Bureau of Finance until May of this year. After an investigation by the Bureau of Finance, it was discovered that the shop had embezzled the special tax collected during its operation and failed to pay it. In addition to ordering the shop to pay the outstanding tax, a fine of twenty times the amount of tax embezzled was imposed as a warning.

### Public Transportation Company Improves Ticket Sales

In order to eliminate scalpers and facilitate ticket purchases for passengers, the China Railway authorities have strengthened management and established passenger information offices. As a result, the order at the stations has been improving daily. The East Asia Public Transportation Company in this city has also been strengthening its organization and management. In addition to the main office at the intersection of Nanjing and Sichuan Roads and the branch offices in Bazi Bridge and North Sichuan Road, which specialize in selling passenger and baggage tickets for the Central China region, a branch office has also been established on Binshan Road, specializing in selling tickets to military and government personnel and allied military and constitutional personnel in the city. It is also learned that the Bazi Bridge branch of the company, in order to alleviate the difficulty of ticket purchases for citizens in southern Shanghai, has organized a special self-defense corps under the guidance of the Taishan Police Sub-bureau to maintain order in the queue for ticket sales and to provide passengers with information on all travel-related matters. They will also provide answers. It is also reported that the branch has obtained the consent of the Municipal Postal Administration to set up a counter in the adjacent Bazi Bridge Post Office, specifically for selling tickets to North China, which will begin operations immediately. All baggage tickets for Central and North China are also available at the new location. It is understood that the branch aims to provide convenient services to passengers. If passengers have any complaints about the members or staff of the self-defense corps, they can confidentially report them, and the branch will gladly accept them. If an investigation reveals that their conduct is indeed improper, they will be dismissed immediately.

### Citywide Traffic Control Implemented Today
### Military Police and Self-Defense Corps Deployed to Direct Traffic

The Municipal Police Bureau will, from today (the 25th) to the 31st, fully implement the "Traffic Control Enhancement Week" in conjunction with military authorities such as the army, navy, and marine corps, and the Baojia self-defense corps. From 8:30 to 10:30 in the morning and from 5:00 to 7:00 in the afternoon each day, military police and Baojia personnel will be dispatched to direct traffic at major and secondary intersections in their respective districts.

### Military Vehicles to be Dealt With Uniformly

It is reported that those who violate traffic regulations will have their citizen certificates, residence permits, driver's licenses, etc., temporarily confiscated. Pedestrians and drivers will be punished according to law after being interrogated at the police sub-bureau. For vehicles related to the authorities, the military authorities will be contacted for appropriate handling of the vehicles. A considerable number of military vehicles (excluding those related to the military) have also been found to be in violation, and strict measures must be taken in this regard. The organization consists of police officers from each sub-bureau, military police, Baojia leaders, and self-defense corps members. The Traffic Division of the Public Works Bureau will manage and direct traffic throughout the city. The first, second, third, and fourth teams of the Police Headquarters will also participate. The first team members will be responsible for liaison with the relevant sub-bureaus. The second and third teams, totaling fifty members, will be assigned fifteen to Zhabei, fifteen to Laozha, and ten to Xincheng sub-bureaus, respectively. Regarding special sentry areas, the sub-bureau chiefs will mobilize appropriate team members and Baojia corps members as possible to achieve the desired goals.

### Key Points of Traffic Enforcement Service

(A) The main authority for traffic enforcement is the Traffic Section of the Second Division of each sub-bureau. (B) Traffic team members actively assist the Traffic Section of the Second Division of each sub-bureau. (C) Baojia self-defense corps members are convened by each sub-bureau and actively assist in implementing enforcement policies based on the district's traffic conditions, especially regarding pedestrians and rickshaws passing on the left side of the road, strict adherence to traffic signals, and pedestrians crossing the road outside designated areas. (D) Baojia self-defense corps members who detect traffic violations must immediately report to a police officer for handling, and self-defense corps members must not act unilaterally. At the same time, the Construction Bureau is responsible for painting white markings in traffic safety zones. Yellow lines are painted at major intersection crossings to indicate stopping lines for vehicles and crosswalks for pedestrians. Major intersections will have the direction of turns painted with white lines, and unnecessary parking areas will be removed. After this week, in order to promote traffic ethics among the general public, every Wednesday will be designated as "Traffic Enforcement Day," and the enforcement guidelines will be the same as those implemented this week.

### Silver and Money Industries Decide to Exchange Negotiable Instruments the Next Day; Implemented Starting This Month on the 30th

The silver and money industries in this city, in view of the frequent increase in the number of negotiable instruments received by member firms from customers, have found the work of exchange, accounting, and agency exchange to be quite difficult. The clearance of balances affects manpower and resources. The increased exchange differences and the inability to complete exchanges and collections on the same day have been felt. In order to give the industry sufficient time for exchange, the joint meeting of the silver and money industries has jointly decided to actively plan and implement the exchange of negotiable instruments the next day. The board of directors of the Chamber of Commerce subsequently approved it and submitted it to the working group and subcommittees to discuss the implementation details. The matter was submitted to the joint meeting of the two industries again, and it was decided to officially implement it starting on the 30th of this month. In addition to separately notifying all banks and money houses yesterday to comply with the attached schedule, change or revise the new measures for the exchange of negotiable instruments and collection of negotiable instruments, it is especially important to note that the negotiable instruments to be exchanged on the 30th must be sorted out in advance on the 28th and 29th (the Sunday will also be open exceptionally) and sent to the Clearing House before the 30th, so that they can be presented to the paying bank at that time. Return items will also be handled in accordance with the new method. The announcements and new measures of the two industry clearinghouses are as follows:

### Clearing House Notice

The Silver Industry Joint Clearing House issued a notice to member banks and money houses stating: This Clearing House, in accordance with the decision of the Chamber of Commerce, will change the time for exchanging negotiable instruments and collecting negotiable instruments and will implement it on July 30. The implementation measures have been stipulated and communicated to all industries for reference. As July 30 is a Monday, all negotiable instruments that each industry should receive from each other on Saturday, July 28, which are not exchanged or sent to the Clearing House for collection, will certainly be numerous. In order to ensure that these negotiable instruments can be cleared in a timely manner and that the staff of the Clearing House and the Clearing House can increase their preparations for the practical handling of the new measures, it has been decided that negotiable instruments from each exchange house that have not been exchanged on the 28th can be exchanged according to the new measures in advance on the 28th or 29th, so that they can be submitted for exchange at 9:00 am on the 30th. Negotiable instruments from each exchange house, each agency exchange house of this Clearing House, and each silver and money industry that are received on the 28th and not exchanged or collected should be sent to the Clearing House one day in advance in accordance with the new measures, and should be submitted on the 29th, which is a Sunday.

### Mr. and Mrs. Lu Donate to Disaster Relief and Education

Mr. Lu Shoukang wrote in a letter: "Since the city has suffered air raids, the number of displaced compatriots has been increasing daily. Fortunately, enthusiastic people from all walks of life have been donating large sums of money, which is also the compassion that mankind should have.

Therefore, in response to your newspaper's call to 'not forget education while providing disaster relief, and not forget disaster relief while providing education,' in addition to separately donating one million yuan to the air raid relief fund, I am hereby donating one million yuan to your newspaper's ninth scholarship fund.

### Impersonating Government Officials, Armed Robbery, Arrested; Five Criminals Transferred to the District Prosecutor's Office for Handling

In order to prevent armed robbery, the Municipal Police Bureau implemented a "Week to Report Armed Robbers" from the 1st to the 31st of this month, instructing all sub-bureaus to make efforts to report armed robbers to the authorities for handling according to law. Ma Shijie and Shen Tingrong, plainclothes police chiefs of the Fourth Division, received a tip that robbers Zheng Yunhai and others, on June 27, at around 7:00 pm, went to the home of Sun Heshang at No. 4, Yinyu Lane, Zhenning Road, Nanshi, impersonated government officials of a certain unit, and robbed more than 5 million yuan and more than 3 taels of gold, a major case, and were now hiding in Room 513 of the Yu Dong Hotel at No. 95, Sizang Road.

### Upholding the Buddhist Tenet of Compassion, Serving Compatriots Affected by Air Raids: The City Buddhist Association Urges Followers

Recently, the City Buddhist Association, in order to relieve air raid victims, issued a letter to all abbots and senior lay Buddhists in the city, stating in part: "The most important teaching of Buddhism is compassion. Compassion means giving happiness to humanity, and sorrow means removing human suffering. The value of the teachings left by the Buddha lies in the ability of his followers to put them into practice. If we cannot practice these teachings, we will lose our qualifications as Buddhists and tarnish the golden words of the Buddha, causing the entire Buddhist community to lose its luster. All abbots, senior lay Buddhists, men and women, you all know that this is a crucial time, a time to test whether Buddhism is beneficial to the world, whether the teachings of the Buddha and the good words spoken by Buddhists on a daily basis are redeemable checks, and whether Buddhists are purely selfish, cold-blooded, and lacking in compassion. Everything is now a great touchstone for us! Especially as we face this imminent catastrophe, we must stand tall and put the Buddha's teachings into practice, showing people the facts. We are all standing on the land of Shanghai. The danger to all of Shanghai has arrived. The lives and property of five million people are at risk. Recent air raids have deeply warned us that bombs have no eyes and explode upon impact. Rows of houses are bombed and collapse, and people die or are injured, and those who survive have no home to return to and no means of livelihood, becoming helpless people. Since we are Buddhists, and fortunately have not died today and our property has not been destroyed, we have truly experienced the impermanence of body and wealth. We should uphold the Buddhist tenet of compassion and serve our suffering compatriots. We are now establishing temporary shelters for disaster victims, using several temples in the current urban area of Shanghai as temporary lodging for those affected. The abbot designated for each temple will be the director of that shelter. The Association will do its utmost to oversee everything and fulfill its responsibilities to those affected. We hope that all abbots and Buddhist lay Buddhists, men and women, in Shanghai will stand together under the banner of the Buddha's compassion, those with strength contributing strength, those with money contributing money, practicing great compassion, acting as fearless messengers in this dangerous situation of life and death, and making the Dharma treasures spoken by our Buddha fully redeemable checks!"
