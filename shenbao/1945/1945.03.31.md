### Minister Zhao of the Propaganda Department Broadcast Last Night

Nanjing, 30th (Central News Agency) - Minister Zhao of the Propaganda Department delivered a radio address from 8:20 PM to 8:50 PM on the 30th, titled "The Peace Movement and the National Revolution." He began by stating that in the five years since the National Government's return to the capital, due to the evolution of the political situation and the expansion of the current situation, national salvation has entered a crucial stage requiring internal peaceful unification and urgent external freedom. He then raised three issues, elaborating on them as follows: First, the essence of the Sino-Japanese peace movement is the re-emergence of the National Revolution. The realization of comprehensive peace is the only savior for turning the entire situation from danger to safety. The future of China and the future of East Asia are entrusted to the peace movement. Second, regarding anti-communism, the Chinese Communist Party, in pursuit of its ambition to seize power, has repeatedly obstructed China's peaceful unification. Since the National Government's return to the capital, it has intensified its efforts, simultaneously advocating a national united front and propagating a bottomless war of resistance, while also expanding its army and vying for territory. Therefore, from a historical perspective, the Chinese Communist Party not only hinders peaceful unification but also constrains the great cause of revival and national construction. Hence, the entire nation should consistently uphold the anti-communist stance. Third, regarding national construction, it cannot be achieved in three to five years. It requires decades or even centuries of effort. Based on past history, countries such as France, the United States, and Japan succeeded only after decades or even hundreds of years of effort. He urged the entire nation to trust the government, uphold the spirit of public service over personal gain, and strive together persistently to succeed.

### Wartime People's Representative Conference Holds Closing Ceremony Yesterday, Issues Declaration and Circular Telegram

Nanjing, 30th (Central News Agency) - The Wartime People's Representative Conference of various provinces and cities held its third day of meetings on the 30th, continuing at the National Assembly Hall at 10:00 AM. First, the Secretary-General read the draft declaration of the conference, and the drafters separately read the draft circular telegrams, (1) to various countries and nations of the world, (2) to various nations of East Asia, which were unanimously approved by all present. The Wartime People's Representative Conference of various provinces and cities completed its mission in an enthusiastic atmosphere, and then held the closing ceremony. Chairman Xu Lie delivered the closing remarks, stating: We hope that the government can adopt the resolutions of this conference, but we must not forget that we are the people. We must implement them ourselves. We must start with ourselves in implementing our own resolutions, not rely on others, start from now, and also extend them into the future. Remember that the late Chairman Wang once said that China will surely be saved because China has 400 million undying consciences. Dawn is breaking, and the call for unification has already been shouted. We must bring out our consciences and advance towards a bright future.

Full Text of the Declaration

Considering the increasingly serious situation and the imminent danger to the nation's future, the people of the whole country deeply feel that every citizen is responsible for the rise and fall of the nation. They urgently need to unite the people, rise up together, and work with the government to overcome difficulties together. Therefore, the people's representatives of various provinces and cities gathered in the capital in a spirit of self-motivation and self-awareness to hold the National Wartime People's Representative Conference of various provinces and cities, to discuss national affairs, fully contribute to the government on the suffering of various localities and the demands of the people, unite all forces, and fight together to win China's freedom and complete domestic unification.

The mission undertaken by the conference is extremely important. It not only seeks fundamental solutions to the various adverse phenomena in the current political, economic, social, and cultural fields, but also discusses countermeasures for various aspects of people's livelihood construction, urges the government to adopt and implement them, and focuses on launching a unified national salvation movement to break the current political deadlock, open up China's future, resolve the general psychological depression of the Chinese people, follow the teachings of the Founding Father, and complete the great cause of the National Revolution. We respectfully present what we believe should be noted in the three aspects of nationalism, democracy, and people's livelihood in the future, as follows:

Launch a National Salvation Movement

(1) Launching a unified national salvation movement and completing the National Revolution is the only correct goal for saving China. Compatriots across the country should gather all their strength to achieve it. All those who in the past clung to party concepts, class consciousness, and regional prejudices should abandon them and launch a unified national salvation movement under the supreme principle of the nation and the people. The unity of the people should form the unity of political forces, the unity of thought and ideology should promote the unity of action and pace, and then it will be sufficient to build a modern nation and strive for national independence, freedom, and equality. Therefore, we advocate following the teachings of the Founding Father to seek the unity of national ideals, completing national organizations to strengthen national power, and following this path to unite from top to bottom with sincerity and unity to complete the great cause of the National Revolution. We also call on the great powers not to treat China as a battlefield, and especially not to bomb everywhere with airplanes, to preserve the nation's vitality and protect the safety of our compatriots.

Unify National Administration

(2) Unify national administrative institutions and complete national independence and unification as soon as possible. After the National Government returned to the capital, in several regions of the country, on the one hand, due to historical and environmental relations based on the continued accumulation of local habits, it failed to fundamentally clarify the corruption and deterioration of local counter-revolutionary forces with bold and decisive measures. On the other hand, it was affected by the continuing war, avoided treatment, and was subject to many constraints. Therefore, it is necessary to unify the administrative institutions throughout the country and complete national independence and unification as soon as possible.

Freedom of Speech and Assembly

(3) Guarantee the people's freedom of speech and assembly, and establish people's opinion organs at all levels. The Founding Father once showed us the meaning of politics, which is managing the affairs of the people, and those who understand the affairs of the people best are the people themselves. The Republic of China is the republic of the Chinese people. The Founding Father was deeply concerned with cultivating the political power of the people in the Three Principles of the People and the Outline of National Construction. In today's China, whether internally or externally, political power and administrative power need to help each other to overcome difficulties, and the government and the people need to cooperate to advance politics. The government must promulgate laws to guarantee the people's freedom of assembly, and at the same time, central and local governments should establish people's opinion organs at all levels as organizations for the people to gather their forces and express their opinions.

Complete Local Self-Government

(4) Complete local self-government as soon as possible and convene a national assembly after the war. Local self-government is the foundation for the training of democracy. Constitutional government can only be implemented after local self-government is completed. Before the Incident, commentators did not understand and demanded an early end to political tutelage and the implementation of constitutional government. They did not understand the division of the national construction process and wanted to repeat Yuan Shikai's usurpation of the country. The plan for today is to follow the teachings of the Founding Father, complete local self-government as soon as possible as the foundation for the implementation of constitutional government. As for the convening of the National Assembly, although it is an essential plan, at present, the production of representatives of the National Assembly and the election of representatives of the National Assembly in various places have factual difficulties and cannot be done hastily. Even if it is done hastily, it will not be able to represent true public opinion and will instead be used by bureaucrats and politicians as tools for personal political struggles. At present, only various preparatory works for the convening of the National Assembly can be done. After the end of the war, it will be convened and constitutional government will be implemented. (To be continued)

Editorial

### Thoroughly Investigate Speculators Disrupting the Market

Recently, the market situation in this city has once again become chaotic. What is most noteworthy is, first, the weak prices of general non-urgent and non-essential goods, and second, the wild rise in the black market prices of gold and public bonds, and stocks. Regarding the drop in prices, the general drop in prices may seem like a good phenomenon at first glance, but upon actual investigation, the most significant drop is in cosmetics, which have fallen by about 50% compared to the beginning of the year. Other items that have fallen by more than 10% include cigarettes, newspapers, fine cloth, and charcoal. The reasons for the price drops are either due to seasonal factors, the inability to continue hoarding, or the weak purchasing power of citizens, who are not buying at high prices, forcing the goods to be released. It is also due to hoarders selling their goods for cash in order to seek other speculative windfalls. As for daily necessities for ordinary people, especially food, the decline is very slow, or even non-existent, and prices continue to rise. For example, rice only fell by 1% in mid-March compared to early March, flour only fell by 3.6% in the same period, salt rose by 7.7%, and soybean oil also rose by 4.6% (March 24 China Industry Newspaper statistics). There is no reason for optimism about this trend of price increases and decreases. The living pressure on ordinary citizens has not been eased in the slightest, and another social and economic crisis has already extended its more terrifying dark shadow, pressing tightly on every honest citizen.

This dark shadow is the wild surge in gold, public bonds, and stocks. Taking the black market price of gold as an example, if it was 100 in November of last year, it increased by 32.8% in December, 54.6% in January of this year compared to December, and soared again to 122.5 in February compared to January of this year. It increased by 6.3% in early March compared to February, increased again by 10.9% in mid-March compared to early March, and continued to surge wildly in late March, currently exceeding the 5 million mark! In terms of stocks, the popular stock of Wing On Textile Mill rose from 585 yuan at the end of January to 1,820 yuan at the end of March; Commercial Press rose from 18,000 yuan to 25,000 yuan; Kang Yuan Canning rose from 129 yuan to 310 yuan; King Lun Shirt & Socks rose from 24 yuan to 53 yuan; and most of the rest have risen by more than 50%. In addition, the black market for public bonds is also showing a wild upward trend.

Why do we say that this phenomenon of rising prices is a dark shadow threatening the social economy? Because this rise is a reflection of a social and economic crisis, not a normal phenomenon. Gold, public bonds, etc., from an economic standpoint, no longer have a direct relationship with prices. That is, even if prices rise, the price of gold should not skyrocket. Moreover, prices are not rising, so there is absolutely no basis for the price of gold to rise. Its rise is entirely driven by speculation and rumors! As for stocks, we sincerely hope that they have a healthy rise, in order to absorb the excess purchasing power of asset holders and use it as production capital. However, in reality, the recent wild rise is happening at a time when all industries are in decline and production is at a standstill. How can we explain that this rise is helpful for increasing production? In fact, it is the result of the most terrifying speculation, just like the soaring prices of gold and public bonds.

Further research into the creation of this market crisis shows that it was entirely triggered by the Lunar New Year, that is, it began with the enemy's landing on Iwo Jima and the Crimea Conference at that time. Due to the general public's intuitive misjudgment of the war situation, and due to the enemy's strategic propaganda regarding the battlefield and politics, speculators took the opportunity to create rumors and fuel the flames. Some people with floating capital and hoarders were also confused by the speculators' rumors, either directly using their funds or selling off goods that were at risk of being lost under war conditions, exchanging them for cash, and uniformly joining the wave of the crazy market. The result of this blind action cannot but be held responsible for disrupting the social economy and making ordinary citizens suffer the consequences!

Market chaos has never been greater than it is today! And the hardship of life for citizens in the middle and lower classes, and the inability of legitimate industrial and commercial operators to maintain their businesses, has never been greater than it is today! Moreover, market chaos is enough to plunge ordinary citizens and legitimate industrial and commercial businesses into a deeper abyss of suffering, forming a serious social and economic crisis. In this decisive situation, and at a time when the Shanghai municipal administration is gradually getting on the right track, such rumors and speculation cannot be allowed to exist. Not long ago, the Shanghai Branch of the Special Court was established, and it should immediately exert its power of sanction against crimes that endanger the wartime economy. Therefore, we hope that the municipal authorities will pay close attention, thoroughly investigate speculators who disrupt the market, and take decisive and severe measures to curb chaos.

### Japanese Air Force Attacks Changting Airport

Mainland Base Reporting Team, 30th (Central News Agency) - The US Air Force stationed in Chongqing is coordinating with the US military, which recently attempted to invade the Chinese coast, in an attempt to obtain a base in eastern China.

### Sixteen Japanese Nationals Commended

Nanjing, 30th (Central News Agency) - The National Government has commended sixteen Allied nationals, including Nagano Seiichiro, for their enthusiasm in engaging in education, medicine, charity, and industry, and for benefiting our people. On the fifth anniversary of the return to the capital, it issued an order to grant commendation certificates and bonuses, which has been officially announced by the National Government. The Propaganda Department and the Japanese Embassy have also issued statements on this matter. The details are as follows:

Order of the National Government

Order of the National Government, March 30. Since the conclusion of the alliance treaty between China and Japan, the friendship between the two countries has become increasingly consolidated. The nationals of both countries deeply understand the government's policy of friendship and good neighborliness, and have created an atmosphere of mutual support in practical matters, which should be commended. It has been found that sixteen friendly foreign nationals, including Nagano Seiichiro, Seki Masaru, Morishima Fuusa, Maekawa Tankichi, Nishikado Teiichi, Kozuka Jisaku, Takaoka Sozaburo, Kitajima Nando, Higashi Keiji, Watanabe Ryusaku, Imai Shuzo, Kanemoto Mitsuhide, Hirooka Takamasa, Yabe Haru, Komatsu Suzue, and Shibayama Matsue, have engaged in education, medicine, charity, and industry, benefiting our people with their enthusiasm and effectiveness. They are truly meritorious and should be rewarded with high honors. In addition to issuing each of them a certificate of commendation, and awarding each of them a bonus, which will be transferred by the Executive Yuan to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for forwarding to the Japanese Embassy, they are hereby commended. This order is issued.

Praise from the Japanese Embassy

The Japanese Embassy issued commendation certificates to the above sixteen people and issued a statement saying: Although the Japanese Embassy in China has already commended nineteen outstanding Japanese residents and two business companies twice, on February 11 and March 8 of last year, for their contributions to the realization of Sino-Japanese friendship, it has now rigorously selected sixteen people from among them, including Nagano Seiichiro, on the anniversary of the return to the capital, and the Ambassador to China has awarded them commendation certificates. Among these individuals are educators, religious figures, and business people, all of whom have thoroughly understood the concept of morality and righteousness in Sino-Japanese friendship. For more than ten years, they have been educating Chinese children, or standing up for medical care in remote and impoverished areas, striving for friendship, and even rescuing many Chinese people under enemy air raids, practicing the principle of shared life and death, and gaining the respect and trust of the Chinese people. The current awardees have all been rigorously selected, and it is inevitable that there are some outstanding individuals who have been overlooked. It is hoped that more and more outstanding residents who thoroughly understand the spirit of morality and righteousness will emerge, embody the fundamental spirit of the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty and the Greater East Asia Declaration, and contribute to strengthening the foundation of cooperation between China and Japan.

The Shanghai Branch of the Chinese News Association, in celebration of the National Government Capital Relocation Anniversary, with the support of the Shanghai Football Association, held a football demonstration match at the Racecourse yesterday (30th) morning at 10:00 AM. Chen Binhe, the chairman of the association, and guests including Lieutenant Colonel Izubuchi, the Army Reporting Department Chief of the Allied Japan Shanghai, Captain Matsushima, the Fleet Reporting Department Chief, and Lieutenant Matsumoto attended. The Japanese Navy Band specially came to the venue to play the national anthems of China and Japan, and played six famous songs including the March for Defending Greater East Asia, the Song of Victory, and the Navy March. The melodies were majestic and the applause thundered. First, Chen Binhe gave a speech, followed by congratulatory speeches by the two chiefs, Izubuchi and Matsushima. The football performance match then began. (For details of the football match, see the sports section of the weekly magazine).

Chen Binhe's Speech

Today is the fifth anniversary of the National Government's Capital Relocation Day. The Shanghai Branch of the Chinese News Association is holding a football match to express its congratulations, which has two meanings that can symbolize our direction of effort:

First, we have a goal. The goal of a football match is to score into the opponent's goal. The current goal of the Greater East Asia War is to achieve the liberation of all the nations of Greater East Asia. The enemy, Britain and the United States, used to enslave the nations of Greater East Asia and suck their blood. When the Greater East Asia War broke out, it completely shattered the British and American dream of enslavement and ushered in the dawn of national liberation. The enemy is unwilling to give up its dream of enslavement and is trying to reassert itself with its remaining power. This is a crisis that threatens the survival of all East Asian nations. We must work together with one heart to persist in completing our final goal.

Second, in a football match, each player has a position and communicates with each other, responding to the offense and defense. The people of all countries in East Asia also have positions. Each person should stick to their position, pool their wisdom and efforts, and move towards a common goal together.

Today, we are here to celebrate the National Government Capital Relocation Anniversary. At the same time, in view of the fact that the Greater East Asia War has reached its most tense and decisive stage, we must emulate the striving spirit of football players, stick to our positions, respond in unison, closely communicate, drive out the enemy, and complete the great cause of China's unification and liberation, and complete the great cause of the liberation of the entire East Asian nation.

Today, we are honored to have the Army and Navy Reporting Department Chiefs of the allied countries come to give speeches, expressing their congratulations. We are even more delighted to have the Navy Band of the allied countries come to play, and we would also like to thank all the players participating in the football match.

Celebration Meeting by Three Organizations

The Shanghai Citizens' Welfare Association, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, and the Shanghai Branch of the Chinese News Association jointly held a celebration meeting at the Great Light Theater at 5:00 PM, and the situation was enthusiastic. Wen Guanting, the chairman of the Citizens' Welfare Association, Yuan Ludeng, the chairman of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, and Chen Binhe, the chairman of the Shanghai Branch of the News Association, formed the presidium of the meeting, and invited former Municipal Government Secretary-General Luo and Municipal Propaganda Office Director Liu to give instructions.

Yuan Ludeng's Opening Remarks

Yuan Ludeng gave the opening remarks, roughly saying: "Today, the three organizations are holding a celebration meeting for the fifth anniversary of the National Government Capital Relocation, and we are very honored to have you all here. What is the significance of our celebration meeting today? We should review it: First, with the cooperation of the allied country Japan, unequal treaties have been abolished and concessions have been recovered. China has embarked on the road of freedom and independence. The long-cherished wish of decades has been realized. How should we work hard to enable China to complete its restoration and construction? Second, China has already joined the war and is standing on the same front with the allied countries, fighting to destroy Britain and the United States. However, the ambitions of Britain and the United States are difficult to contain, and now they are gradually invading East Asia again. How should we attack them so that they will no longer be a scourge to East Asia? Third, in the current stage where the war situation is becoming increasingly tense, the whole country must unite as one, strengthen its will, unify its steps, be diligent and hardworking, brave and vigorous, gather total strength, and contribute to the war. Have we fully done this? We must deeply understand and strive for the above three points. In short, we must step up our efforts, contribute total strength, and move towards the path of restoring China and defending East Asia."

Secretary-General Luo's Instructions

After the speech, Secretary-General Luo was invited to give instructions. The general idea was: "As the saying goes, "Heaven helps those who help themselves," and "Seek more blessings for yourself." Now that the war has spread all over the world, the people of any country cannot avoid suffering during the war. Because there is suffering, the hope of seeking welfare is even more urgent. Shanghai has organizations such as the Citizens' Welfare Association and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, which all aim to seek the welfare of the citizens. However, because of the result of Britain and the United States enslaving Shanghai for a century, the habit of valuing private interests has been cultivated among the majority of citizens. For example, before the baojia system, there was an attitude among citizens of sweeping the snow in front of their own doors and not caring about the frost on other people's roofs, with very little mutual aid spirit. Now the municipal authorities can guarantee to the citizens that they will never be selfish and will do their best to seek welfare for the citizens. The colleagues in the municipal government are determined to follow the citizens and put the municipal administration on the right track. It can also be said that the authorities lead the citizens to put the municipal administration on the right track. Therefore, putting the municipal administration on the right track is not only the responsibility of the municipal government, but the people also have a common responsibility. Officials and people must work together to achieve the goal. Today, on the anniversary of the National Government Capital Relocation, I would like to put forward two hopes: (1) Citizens must exert themselves to seek welfare. (2) Citizens must enthusiastically participate in organizations that are beneficial to society, and seek the welfare of the entire society through the power of unity, so that personal welfare can also be achieved." Finally, the film "Turning Back is the Shore" was shown, and the meeting did not end until 7:00 PM.

### Business Tax Returns Under Review by the Bureau

In order to implement the collection of the current spring business tax in the former One and Eight Districts, the Municipal Finance Bureau has divided the area into six districts and established tax collection offices, ordering manufacturers in all industries to declare their business volume and capital by the 20th of this month, in order to levy the business tax for January, February and March. The bureau has ordered its subordinates to review the business volume and capital totals in the tax returns submitted by manufacturers in various industries. Those who have not yet submitted their returns are being urged to submit them by the end of this month. At the same time, investigators have been dispatched to investigate whether the declarations are true. It has been decided to notify merchants in various industries to implement the collection of business tax starting from April 1.

### Mayor's Cup Football Replay: Qiao Lian Defeats Donghua: Two to One

In the Mayor's Cup football quarter-finals, the previous match between Donghua and Qiao Lian resulted in no goals. Yesterday afternoon at 3:30 PM, they met again at Yiyuan. As a result, Qiao Lian defeated Donghua by two to one. In the first half, each side scored once. Donghua attacked first. After ten minutes of stalemate, Luo Xulai fouled in the penalty area and was penalized with a twelve-yard penalty. Lao Sun took the shot and scored with one kick. Qiao Lian counterattacked. At the 18th minute, Ottonilo got the ball and sent it far forward. Zhang Lin'gen lost his footing, and Tekni took the opportunity to break in. Bang Lun was unprepared and was poisoned by Tekni, tying the score at one to one. Afterwards, Qiao Lian's offensive was quite strong. Fortunately, Bang Lun's defense was effective. Donghua counterattacked, but unfortunately Qiao Lian had excellent luck and they were all saved by McNitty one by one. After the break, both sides had offensive opportunities, but after Donghua's You Liang missed a sure shot, their momentum gradually weakened. Qiao Lian took the opportunity to break in and created a corner kick for the second time. Di Panna opened the kick for the second time, and Bao Jie headed the ball. Bang Lun made a save, but unfortunately his right hand was injured in the first half, so he failed to catch the ball and it bounced in from the fingertips. Qiao Lian got a late lead of two to one and finally eliminated Donghua.

Dispatch time yesterday was 7:10 PM

### Completing a Decisive Battle Posture: Achieving the Final Victory: Speech by Izubuchi, Chief of the Army Reporting Department

The Shanghai Branch of the Chinese News Association held a football performance match at the Racecourse yesterday to celebrate the National Government Capital Relocation Anniversary, and specially invited Lieutenant Colonel Izubuchi, Chief of the Army Reporting Department of the Allied Japan Shanghai, and Captain Matsushima, Chief of the Fleet Reporting Department, to give speeches one after another. The speeches are recorded in order as follows:

Today, on the occasion of the Capital Relocation Anniversary, I think it is very worthy of celebration. Since the National Government's Capital Relocation, it has begun to establish a national policy of peace and anti-communism and adjust the basic relations between China and Japan. First, the Sino-Japanese Basic Treaty was established, and then in December of the 30th year of the Republic of China (1941), the Japanese Empire declared war on Britain and the United States for the purpose of self-defense to maintain stability in East Asia. China and Japan then decided to share joys and sorrows based on the spirit of the Basic Treaty. The National Government then announced its participation in the war, and the relationship between China and Japan became even closer. What is even more noteworthy is that in the third year after the Capital Relocation, the Japanese government returned the exclusive concessions, recognized the recovery of the Shanghai Public Concession, the Xiamen Public Concession, and the legation area in Beiping, and abolished extraterritorial rights and returned enemy property. On June 30 of the 33rd year of the Republic of China (1944), the return of the Shanghai concession was completed. In the fifth year, the National Government strived to establish a wartime posture. On November 10 of that year, Chairman Wang passed away, which was a sad thing for the East Asian nation. Today, the East Asian war situation is becoming increasingly fierce, and the arrogant enemy Britain and the United States may land in mainland China and gradually approach the Japanese homeland step by step. However, Japan has made full preparations, and the people of the whole country are implementing total armament, waiting for the enemy to come.

The Greater East Asia War is a war that determines the rise and fall of the East Asian nation, not only Japan. If it cannot be won, then the prosperity of the East Asian nation cannot be sought, and the construction of China cannot be completed. I hope that under the leadership of Acting Chairman Chen, you will follow the three major national policies of maintaining correct thinking, ensuring social order, and increasing production, in order to complete the decisive battle posture and achieve the final victory.

### Fighting to the End, Seeking a Bright Future: Speech by Naval Information Director Matsushima

Today, on the anniversary of the National Government's return to the capital, it is a great honor for me to meet with Chinese youths filled with the spirit of national construction and participate in this historic ceremony. I sincerely wish China a boundless future. Since the National Government's return to the capital, five years have passed, during which countless hardships and trials have been overcome. Today, a solid foundation for peaceful national construction has been laid, and it has become the central body for building Greater East Asia, marching forward. This can be entirely attributed to the Chinese predecessors inheriting the will of the national father, Mr. Sun Wen, fully understanding the destiny of Greater East Asia and China's mission. Today, as we recall the past and look to the future, I deeply feel that the responsibility of you young people is even greater.

The War Situation Has Entered the Decisive Stage

The Greater East Asia War has reached the decisive stage. Our Japan, in accordance with its established strategy, lures the enemy into our territorial waters to annihilate them. The war situation since March 17th has entered a truly decisive stage. The enemy, the American forces, has concentrated almost all the strength of its Pacific Fleet, engaging in reckless combat. After the battle of Iwo Jima, the enemy's losses were unprecedented in history, with more than half of the 60,000 landing troops being annihilated. Moreover, in the aerial battles in the sea south of the Japanese mainland, the enemy fleet suffered extremely heavy losses. Today, in the Okinawa Islands, the fighting has only been going on for a few days, but the enemy fleet has already lost more than one-third. We do not need to explore the future trends of the enemy's operations, but our mission is only to make the enemy shed a great deal of blood to crush their ambition. What the United States is feeling today is the lack of human resources, so even if they use huge quantities of materials, the day of their failure and setback is not far away.

The Enemy American Strength Is Diminishing Daily

We are making every effort to prevent the Chinese mainland from becoming a battlefield. The current battle in Okinawa is also the prelude to a defensive war.

The enemy American Pacific Fleet, its Third Fleet, was already destroyed and disintegrated before the battle of the Philippines. Now, only the Fifth and Seventh Fleets exist. As the enemy conducts operations, their strength is diminishing daily, and the number of battleships and aircraft carriers is decreasing.

When the battle of the Philippines began last October, the enemy concentrated more than 1,300 ships and over 2,000 aircraft. But by the time of the battle of Iwo Jima in February of this year, the number of ships had been reduced to 600, and the number of aircraft to about 1,000. Currently, in Okinawa, the number of ships has been reduced to about 100, and the number of aircraft is decreasing day by day. Moreover, among the enemy pilots, there are even old men over sixty years old, not wearing socks, and all kinds of impoverished states are endless. Although they try to propagandize, they cannot conceal the fact that the American army is in an extremely difficult situation. We believe that the outcome of the war is determined in the last five minutes, and we must immediately rise up and annihilate the enemy.

Sacrifice Everything to Defend the Homeland

China and Japan are the core of Greater East Asia. In order to defend the homeland and achieve independent self-defense, we should spare no sacrifice. Moreover, preventing the enemy from landing in China is to seek the peace and welfare of the Chinese people. We have seen the precedents of Italy and France and cannot but prevent the Chinese mainland from becoming a battlefield.

Enemy propaganda claims that the purpose of landing in China is to end the war and save China. This is completely deceptive. If it becomes a reality, China will be turned into a scorched earth, and the Chinese people will encounter dozens of times more suffering than they do today.

The world is now at a critical juncture of rise and fall. We must fight to the end to fulfill our national mission and seek a bright future and development. Today, on this commemorative day, I hope that you will rise up and work harder to promote the national father's legacy.

### Interview with General Yamashita, Commander of the Japanese Army in the Philippines

The enemy's artillery fire and aircraft explosions always occur five or six times a day. In a small house very close to the front line, General Yamashita Tomoyuki, the supreme commander of the Philippine Expeditionary Force, was sitting calmly in a chair. In the general's living room, there was a small round table, two chairs, a teacup, and an ashtray. The general did not want to say anything, but his piercing eyes were fixed on me. "What exactly do you want to ask?" Under these circumstances, I didn't want to ask anything. General Yamashita sat calmly in the chair, as if he bore the weight of a thousand pounds.

"It seems that we can't hear the bombing now. How about taking a short walk outside?"

The general stood up with his cane in his hand, stepping on the fallen leaves. He broke the silence that had lasted for five months since the start of the decisive battle in the Philippines and finally answered the reporter's questions.

Q: Your Excellency once said that the enemy has already penetrated deep into the belly of Japan. What exactly does this mean?

A: Now I can say it. Japan's initial plan was to lure the enemy deep into the plains of Luzon and Manila, and then encircle and annihilate them from all sides. We are operating according to this plan, and it is going very smoothly. The enemy's loss of 70,000 men is the result of this plan. But what we call the early stage of operations is still before the Philippine forces exert their true abilities, the main naval battle is still to come.

Q: However, in the midst of the fierce war, hasn't Japan also suffered great losses?

A: It is really surprising, Japan's losses are very small. Far less than we expected. Charging, this is the work of the suicide squad, and most of these suicide squads have succeeded. With such loyal and patriotic soldiers, is there any reason not to win?

Q: The Japanese in the mainland are all looking forward to the Japanese army in the Philippines launching a major counter-offensive operation. What is your opinion on this?

A: Troops act according to circumstances, and they fight with deception. If an opportunity arises, we will make a big move and carry out a major offensive operation to annihilate the enemy. If there is no opportunity, we will persevere here for ten or twenty years, constantly depleting the enemy's strength, and drag down the enemy's forces as much as possible, so that the enemy has no strength to attack other places. In the near future, we will definitely find an opportunity for a counter-offensive. The current situation is always advantageous. The Japanese army is prepared for any situation, so there is no need to worry unnecessarily.

-The General changed the subject, talking about the country's century-old plan, and emphasizing national salvation through education. The General revealed his usual aspirations, namely, reforming Japanese family education, mother education, and national schools. This is truly amazing.

"What seems far away but is actually near is the problem of education. If the Japanese receive a little better family education, this war may have already been won. But simply having a belief in victory and being very loyal and courageous is not the key to victory. If people in the country think that we have won now, or that we have completely failed, then these people should just focus on their own family education and children's education!"

-General Yamashita is still alive in the Philippines. After a long conversation with the reporter, and then talking about the unrelated topic of education, it made me trust the general even more. (Yoshimura Team Manila Communication) (Translated from the March 10th Yomiuri Hochi)

### Enemy's Naive Strategy

The Japanese handling plan resolved by the Pacific Problems Research Association in early January was published in mid-February. However, it is now reported that there is another Japanese handling plan drafted by U.S. Treasury Secretary Morgenthau.

Such a plan is not worth mentioning to us. Just as we continue to study how to concretize the war objectives, the enemy is also simply discussing its objectives, or publishing them. If these kinds of documents are read one by one, nothing can be gained except wasting time. We should use this time to strive for victory. However, in any country, there are always some cowardly people who easily fall for the enemy's naive strategies, and even muddy the domestic atmosphere. Therefore, it is necessary to explain the enemy's intentions regarding the Japanese handling plan.

First, it must be known that the so-called Morgenthau plan is actually just a propaganda strategy. The real Japanese handling plan was written at least in the summer of the year before last, and was presented by the Washington government to its owner, the Wall Street financial clique. At the Cairo talks held at the end of November of the same year, Roosevelt informed Chiang Kai-shek of one end of it. A more precise reflection of the case is the resolution of the Pacific Problems Research Association. Under the premise that the research association is hidden in the so-called non-governmental organization, it disguises the real handling of the Qin Dynasty as American public opinion.

What Morgenthau drafted was a strategy to collapse the cowardly and weak among the Japanese. According to the telegram, it seems that as long as the Japanese abandon their proud attitude as a great nation, the war can be resolved. Here lies the enemy's naive attempt. If unconditional surrender really occurs, the enemy can break their word and implement their real handling plan. Once this kind of naive strategy is explained, it is really worthless, but we must also take care to avoid accidents (translated from the March 8th Mainichi Shimbun)

### Overview of the Situation in the Okinawa Islands

The Okinawa Islands are located in the center of the Ryukyu Islands. The largest island in the islands is Okinawa Island, and there are affiliated islands such as Iheya, Kerama, and Kume, all winding from the north to the southwest. The Kerama Islands, where the enemy landed, are located 25 kilometers west of Okinawa Island and consist of eight islands: Tokashiki, Maedajima, Zamami, Aka, Harejima, Shirafushi, and Irejima. Among these islands, the enemy has already landed on Tokashiki, Zamami, and Aka Islands. Among them, Tokashiki and Zamami are the largest in the Kerama Islands. Tokashiki Island has an area of only 8.5 square kilometers, and Zamami Island has 8 square kilometers. The soil quality of the Kerama Islands is roughly the same as that of Okinawa Island, belonging to volcanic rock and ancient rock. The terrain is extremely steep, the mountains are densely wooded, and there are many deer and other wild animals. However, what the enemy intends is the landing on Okinawa Island. The enemy's deployment of part of its forces on the Kerama Islands is for the purpose of using it as a springboard for invading Okinawa Island. Okinawa Island is 130 kilometers long, 35 kilometers wide at its widest point, and 5 kilometers at its narrowest point. It is a long and narrow island with a circumference of 400 kilometers and an area of 1,211 square kilometers, including all the small islands. Compared with the 20 square kilometers of Iwo Jima, it is 60 times larger. Okinawa Island is located in the center of Japan's southern Kyushu and Taiwan, two major strategic bases, about 500 kilometers apart. The great victory in the air battle off the coast of Taiwan last time was obtained in the east of Taiwan, located between the Japanese mainland and the Philippines. Now, Okinawa Island is located between the Japanese mainland and Taiwan, so it is closer to the radius of action of Japanese aircraft. Japan is in an advantageous position here, and it will be able to inflict heavy damage on the enemy by intercepting the enemy forces.

### Explanation of the Rationing System

The rationing system is an important countermeasure for the wartime economy. In the past, during peacetime, material resources were abundant, life was inexpensive, trade was fair, and every household was self-sufficient, and there was originally no need for rationing. Since the incident in our country, due to the war, production has decreased and material resources have gradually become scarce. As a result, those with financial resources manipulate and hoard goods for profit, and the livelihoods of ordinary people have been greatly threatened, arousing market unrest. In order to stabilize people's livelihood, the government created the rationing system.

The implementation of the rationing system in our country is still in its initial stage, and especially in Shanghai, the scope is the largest and the most complex. After more than two years of efforts by the authorities, the rationing of goods in Shanghai has roughly taken shape. However, due to the complex situation, the public's failure to fully understand the meaning of rationing, and the lack of sources of materials, it has not been able to achieve fully satisfactory results.

The original purpose of the goods rationing system was to enable the public to obtain daily necessities at a low price to maintain their lives, and the items obtained should be equal, which is in line with the original purpose of rationing. However, in this society where people's hearts are not ancient, cunning people always use the rationing relationship to falsely report household names, or falsely increase the population, and one person receives several copies of rationing items and other kinds of abuses. Because the city has millions of people, it is very difficult to find out the truth unless someone understands the situation and reports it to the rationing agency. This point is the most difficult for rationing agencies to handle. Therefore, we hope that the people will check themselves and no longer have this kind of behavior. Those who have a small number of bad elements who still follow the old ways should be reported by the public as a public enemy. Because consuming one more share of rationing resources reduces the rationing benefits of the real citizens by one share. In order to maintain their own interests, the citizens should work together with the officials.

The rationing items are mainly daily necessities, such as rice, flour, coal balls, matches, and soap. In recent years, due to reduced production, lack of raw materials, and transportation difficulties, the output cannot meet the demand, and the cost has increased. Therefore, household rationing cannot be distributed on time, and even special rationing is inevitably delayed. This is a matter of fact and there is nothing to be done about it. The office is now making every effort to coordinate with the relevant parties to obtain a smooth outcome, so that the amount of rationing goods is increased, in order to live up to the expectations of the citizens.

It has been almost three months since I took office. I have been reviewing the rationing policy and carrying out the affairs day and night. I hope that I can work together with the citizens of the city to study and improve the situation, so as to achieve the effect of cooperation. I hope that you will give me assistance at any time.

### Protecting Air-raid Shelters by Fan Jinquan

In the event of a bombing, an air-raid shelter is where we avoid disaster and preserve our lives. Therefore, we should protect the air-raid shelters well to prevent damage, so as to avoid difficulties when we need to use them urgently.

There are several points offered for preventing damage to air-raid shelters, and I hope that the authorities and Baojia people will pay attention to them and promote them:

(1) Most of the current air-raid shelters are dug in the mud, or bamboo frames are built on them, and then covered with mud, so they are very easy to damage. Self-defense team posts should be set up near the air-raid shelters to monitor and prevent the unintentional destruction by passersby or children climbing them.

(2) Air-raid shelters should be locked at ordinary times to prevent people from dumping garbage, which would become a place to hide dirt and breed filth, and children from using them as playgrounds.

(3) Air-raid shelters should be covered to prevent rainwater from flowing in during rainy days, which would become a breeding ground for germs and mosquitoes.

The construction of air-raid shelters has become quite common thanks to the efforts of the authorities. But if calculated by population, there are still not enough. We should work hard to speed up the construction. When there is not yet enough average distribution, we must cherish the existing air-raid shelters and not allow them to be damaged.

### A Glimpse into the Rationing of Goods (1) - Liu Yuwu

The rationing system for goods in Shanghai originated in May of the 30th year of the Republic of China [1941]. At that time, there was a panic over rice, and the old Public Works Department commissioned Jardine Matheson and Ewo to order foreign rice to be shipped to Shanghai, and rice shops registered to receive and supply it to the general public.

After June of the 30th year [1941], prices in Shanghai suddenly rose. In order to control the main materials for people's food, the old Public Works Department added a price investigation section in the General Affairs Bureau. Two years later, the section was changed to the Materials Control Department, and soon after to the Materials Control Bureau. Its main task was to control prices and report profiteers. The organization was divided into six sections, namely general affairs, rationing, procurement, guild, investigation and execution, and original price calculation. Mr. Inagaki Noboru served as the director, and there were about 600 Chinese and foreign staff below him.

In August of the 32nd year [1943], the concessions were recovered, and after the establishment of the First District Public Office, the Materials Control Bureau was changed to the Economic Affairs Department. At this time, it handled all the rationing administration of the old one and eight districts and the newly merged district of western Shanghai. The first director was Mr. Chen Riping, who was later succeeded by Feng You. Its internal organization was then changed to five sections, namely general affairs, material procurement rationing, price, industrial and commercial management, and finance.

In mid-August of the 33rd year [1944], the Economic Affairs Department and the Food Bureau were ordered to be abolished. Taking the Food Bureau as the main body, a Goods Rationing Office was organized within the Municipal Government. Mr. Feng You served as the director. Except for Mr. Hirano Osamu, a Japanese staff member, who served as an advisor, and Mr. Fukuda Toshirou, who served as a commissioner, the rest were all local staff.

At the beginning of January of this year, the Municipal Government was reorganized, and Mr. Liu Xingchen took over as the director of the Goods Rationing Office, and continued to handle the wartime economic administration of all rationing materials in Shanghai.

(2) Types and Sources of Rationed Goods

Now, the main rationed materials in Shanghai will be classified and described as follows:

(1) Rice and Flour - In the past, the quantity of rice and flour rationed was approved by the Food Adjustment Committee (the Director of the Food Box Bureau was the chairman of the committee). Rice was purchased by the Rationing Office from the Rice Control Committee, and flour was supplied by the Shanghai District Flour and Wheat Bran Distribution Office. The quantity and price were approved by the committee.

(2) Cooking Oil - The quantity and price of this rationed item were approved by the Oil Grain Professional Committee, and then supplied and sold by the Cooking Oil Distribution Office.

(3) Sugar - After this rationed item was approved, it was supplied by the Sugar Merchants Cooperative Business Office. The quantity and price were approved by both parties.

(4) Coal Balls - This raw material was delivered by the Rationing Office, after consultation and approval, ordering the Coal Association to deliver it to the Da Zhong Lian Coal Company to allocate it to the designated coal ball factories for production. The quantity and price were approved by the relevant parties from time to time.

(5) Matches - This material was supplied by the Shanghai Match Association, and the quantity and price were approved by the relevant authorities and the association.

(6) Soap - This material was supplied and rationed by signing contracts with six factories, namely Wuzhou Pharmacy Gu Ben Soap Factory, China Chemical Industry Society, Da Xin Hua Meng Factory, Mingxing Perfume Soap Factory, Henry Soap Candle Alkali Factory, and Japan Oil and Fat Company.

(7) Artificial Butter - This material was purchased by the Rationing Office from the China Edible Oil Company after consultation and approval with the relevant authorities. The price was jointly approved by the three parties, and it was specially for those who rationed bread.

In addition to the above seven rationed materials, there are also rations for milk, salt, and coal, (milk is still rationed, and there is no unified plan for salt and coal.)

### Short Notes

— Liu Lin

You sent a letter, writing:

"Has your school started its holiday? As for me, I really hope for a short break to rest, to read some books I want to read, to visit friends I want to see... but it's always impossible. I go out early every morning, the cold chills me to the bone, and I return late at night, still having to walk. All I'm asking for is to keep a barely surviving job with a salary that is so meager, what good is it? I'm gradually starting to feel that people like me are the most unfortunate in society. My dear friend, even though you are studying hard, it's still better than me. At least you still have the passion to pursue your ideals. I hope you can hold onto your school life. Once you enter society, all hope will be shattered – unless you can escape the shackles of life alone and regain a free life!"

Life constricts us too tightly. Even while studying, my mind is as preoccupied as yours with the question: "How to survive?" School is not a circle isolated from society. You hope I won't abandon my school life, saying that during school "there's passion to pursue ideals." Aren't you just trying to extract a bit of warmth from your memories? You once wrote: "...I'm chewing over my past again, and everything from the past seems even sweeter." Look at all the changes over these past two years, even in yourself. I guess you must feel lonely now. Loneliness can make a person melancholy. If you can be with many friends like you were in school, or even just a few close friends, you will reignite your passion. Under the heavy weight of life, the wrinkles on the soul are hard to erase. It must be difficult for you to arrange your thoughts. Perhaps the "reunion" version of your friends and you merging together is exactly a portrait of yourself, depicting the contradictions in your thinking. You once hated the city, so do you love the countryside? You yourself know that the countryside, like the city, has social knots intertwined. Perhaps the people in the countryside are more simple and frugal, but the farmers in the countryside now are no longer frugal and simple. They have become quite crafty, even cunning. As for those other "silently struggling poor farmers," would they still bring you hope? The hometown and tranquil life in your memory are absolutely another scene, a beautiful illusion. If you go back to the countryside, you will be disappointed, not only doubting your ideals but also lacking the courage to pursue them.

I must reiterate, you are in a state of loneliness; you have not been swept into the turbid currents of society, you are steadfast. And in fact, you have no way to intervene in the group around you. Because of loneliness, you become melancholic. You only see your own life and family – forgive me for being too blunt. Thus, you sigh, thinking you are the most unfortunate person in the world. Life requires courage, and only life can give you this courage. Hard work should not diminish your courage to pursue ideals. Nostalgia is only a shackle for us. If that comfort is illusory, we will discard it. Without comfort, are we unable to persist in hard work!

You might as well "escape the shackles of life alone and regain a free life." I don't know what your "life" refers to. If it refers to the misery of life, it seems understandable. I believe you certainly don't have the idea of transcending the mundane world, but the tone and meaning of your words make it feel a little too romantic. Do you feel it? We should have confidence, and have some small poems to maintain this confidence, often mentioning the black night.

I really didn't expect to write so much. We have too few opportunities to meet these days. Recently, I found some proofreading work, and I have little free time. If I do, I'll decide to go to your house on Sunday. We can talk freely, and I'll tell you some recent news about my life and the lives of my old friends that you want to know.

### Whip of Life

— Shen Jianying

Life,

Some say you are a whip,

I also admit it.

In my nerves – there is your roar;

In my senses – there is your scar.

You want to have power,

Subdue the spirit of young people;

Dullen the sharp edge of young people,

No more extravagance; no more arrogance.

Therefore –

People often curse, resenting your ruthless driving.

But,

Isn't this also a kind of tempering?

Why –

Can't we

Treat "whipping" as "motivation"

To work hard, force hard, and truly do!

### Boat Tracker

— Shi Di

One shoulder pushes open the surging spray,

One rope holds back a river of wind;

A riverside camel is no different from a desert,

Still carrying endless,

— sunshine, rain and waxing and waning moons.

Casting muscles and bones into nature's furnace for forging.

A song washes away all the toil,

The world here is incomparably simple,

All hatred is always trampled underfoot.

Green fields spread a line,

The ancient life is forever winding.

Thickened heels crush the roots of the grass,

Preferring a myriad of sweat drops to be dried by the river wind.

### Sickness

— Ke Qun

Illness

The nurse sits in the registration room, in this small hospital, she does the accounting, registration... all by herself. When busy, she has to dispense medicine and help with injections. Every day, she has to deal with dozens of patients.

From spring to autumn, and from winter to spring again, withered patients crowd the porch in front. Old, young, tattered clothes wrapped around gaunt bones. Lost eyes, sunken cheeks, cracked dry hands, remind you: you are in a group of skeletons.

A engineering university student intercepts and tells the doctor his troubles:

Two middle-aged people are chatting:

"Every day eating household registration soybeans..."

Another worker with a head full of sores interjects:

"Soybeans in the household registration are very rich in protein;..." He can't even get household registration soybeans to eat.

The nurse is counting banknotes, she thinks:

"It would be good to eat some milk and eggs!"

Near noon, a dockworker comes to see the doctor with his five-year-old daughter. The nurse opens the registration book, she says:

"You're half a month late this time."

"The wages haven't been paid." The worker feels ashamed, and the red cloud on his cheeks becomes even more vibrant.

"Calcium injections need to be injected every day to be effective."

"Anyway, my illness will never get better!" The worker says in a dull voice: "I've had this illness since I was eighteen years old. At that time, I always thought my strength was inexhaustible. If I couldn't carry loads of two hundred or three hundred catties, I would risk my life to carry them on my shoulders, injuring my body."

"If you don't have money, just come to see him!" The nurse says: "I'll intercede with the doctor for you, and give you free treatment."

"Thank you, kind lady!" The worker is a little excited: "When poor people get this disease, they receive the death warrant from King Yama. The little girl's mother (he points to his daughter) also had this disease, but she never vomited any blood. She just coughed, coughed... coughed until her waist was only as thick as a grip! In the end, she died."

The nurse couldn't bear it, and unintentionally exclaimed "Ah!".

The dockworker came quickly for a few days. After two days, a week, half a month... you never see the shadow of his blue coarse cloth work clothes, with a heavy cough, appearing on the porch. Many patients are like this, they come for a few days, and suddenly they don't come anymore, they never come again! But the nurse is still busy registering, counting banknotes, and a large stack of prescriptions piles higher and higher every day.

"Endless patients, incurable diseases!" She sighs, opens the registration book, and several new patients have come again.

Character Dissection

The character dissection stall is located next to the street. A dirty white cloth covers the wooden frame, paper scrolls are inserted in paper boxes, and a price list is displayed in a glass frame. Don't laugh at this simple equipment, its owner is pedantic. This is a lecture on the philosophy of life, its owner is familiar with the hopes, desires, sorrows and joys of people from all walks of life.

The old man sits peacefully behind the wooden frame, coldly watching passers-by through his nearsighted eyes. His expression is somewhat arrogant – don't dislike me for being old and decaying, I know you will have disasters in a couple of days. Red cars come and go, rumbling and kicking up dust. The old man wipes a layer of dust from the glass frame, and then another layer of dust. Life force is worn down in the dust, and long strings of lonely years are passed in the dust.

The breeze whispers, and the March sun warms him hotly. He scratches his gray hair with his long fingernails. If he wasn't concerned about his status, he really wants to take off his clothes and wipe himself. --Because the weather is really annoying.

He had been in a daze from early morning until noon, when a middle-aged woman came to patronize. Judging by her dress, she should be a daughter-in-law or sister-in-law. Her hands must have just finished washing clothes, and her fingers were all blood red.

She brings a letter from her son.

"Your son is very practical!" The old man took off his glasses, read half of it with difficulty, and suddenly said a sentence, and then repeated reading it: "He said that the black dates you entrusted to someone to bring back to the hometown were all eaten by the person who took them. Next time, never bring food back."

"Dissect a character, shall we?" He asked after reading the letter: "Isn't your son going to marry a wife? First ask what her household's fate is? Second ask if she will be beneficial to her mother-in-law?"

The sister-in-law asked about the prices, but did not answer. What can you do with this kind of frugal widow? They use one penny as two pennies; spending money to look at a family letter, and then spending money to dissect a character, will use up the silver dollars in the box.

The old man coldly looks at passers-by again through his nearsighted eyes, the stall is cold and lonely. The March sun shines on his old cotton-padded jacket, shining on his gray hair. An elementary school student walks by, tiptoeing and pulling out two paper scrolls.

"I'll beat you, you little hooligan!" The old man got angry.

"Can't I dissect a character for fortune telling?" The elementary school student took off and ran.

"Your fate? Your fate hasn't sprouted yet!"

The stall is cold and lonely, and the owner is tired and wants to sleep. He thinks of that sister-in-law, and thinks of that naughty child.

"How nice it would be to have such a grandson to manage the stall, or to call for a bowl of plain noodles to eat!"

Red cars come and go, and long strings of lonely years are passed in the dust!

### Review of the Municipal Mayor's Cup Football Re-election: Overseas Chinese Federation Eliminates the Tung Wah Game

— Bi Xian

In the Municipal Mayor's Cup re-election, Tung Wah and the Overseas Chinese Federation met again in Yiyuan at 3:30 yesterday afternoon. Since the previous match ended in a 0-0 draw, it felt even more captivating. Moreover, since it was early spring and the weather was fine, red men and green women were on Xianyang Road, and when I arrived early, I saw shoulder-to-shoulder crowds, and those who went before me, there must have been tens of thousands. In addition to the appeal of the football team, the weather also had a relationship, truly a rare grand occasion. As a result of the competition, Tung Wah flourished first and then declined, with a score of one to two, one goal short, suffering a terrible defeat. The final competition was taken by the Righteous Generals. The audience at the scene all regretted Tung Wah. However, the general enthusiasm of the foreign generals, goes without saying. From then on, the Municipal Mayor's Cup final will be a world of foreigners, with the Shanghai Police and the Overseas Chinese Federation. As I write this, I cannot help but feel emotional. Now I will describe the battle situation yesterday and add a review. First, I will list the personnel of the two armies.

Overseas Chinese Federation Lineup

McNitty, Luo Xulai, Xiladi, Boli Niotoni, Luo Xueweitai, Dipanna Bama (down), Yatuo Mali (up), Taike Ni Bao Jie Weila

Tung Wah Lineup

Zhang Banglun, Li Ning Zhuang Youren, Liang Shutang, Fu Zhen Zhang Lingen, Li Yao Sun Jinshun Dai Lin, Jia Youliang Chen Mingzhe

One goal each in the first half

When the time came, the law enforcement officer Xuan Gu Zhengzhu summoned the captains of both sides. Dai Lin shook hands with Bao Jie as a courtesy. After choosing the direction, the battle began. The Overseas Chinese Federation attacked first, but was blocked by Zhang Lingen. Tung Wah took the opportunity to counterattack, and the five forwards advanced, with great momentum, and the tacit understanding between each other was extraordinary. The V-shaped transmission was wonderful and incomparable. At this time, everything was Tung Wah's world, and the Righteous Generals only had the ability to resist. Unfortunately, both Li Yao and Dai Lin lost by a hair in the final moment. But the Righteous Army was frightened and surprised a lot. At ten minutes, Sun Jinshun intercepted the ball, passed Xuewei Tai, and cleverly blocked the gap, Li Yao had already understood in his heart, and rushed in in time. Unexpectedly, Luo Xulai was anxious and slammed into Li Yao. The referee saw everything clearly and penalized a twelve-yard ball according to the rules, which was taken by Sun Jinshun. The iron legs were the holy hand of the twelve-yard penalty, attacking the east and striking the west, and McNitty was calculated. Tung Wah won this goal, took the lead, and the momentum was even stronger. The five tigers in the front became more and more energetic as they fought. Then Youliang circled and advanced, high pass to the opponent's goal, Mingzhe rushed up and headed in with all his might, but it was a pity that he was offside. At seventeen minutes, Youliang rode alone straight in, as fast as flying, and at fifteen yards, he pulled back and swept out with all his strength. The ball was extremely fast, but the angle was too accurate, and it was saved by Mai. Only by the hardness of the foot, Mai could only pat it out, how could he want to hold it, which can be seen in general, this is also fate and luck. Tung Wah did not get this ball, the good times passed, and bad luck came. At twenty minutes, the Overseas Chinese Federation moved after a long silence. Yatuo Nilo lightly passed to Bao Jie, Bao pulled up a kick, Zhang Lingen steadily kicked out the ball, unexpectedly, between the feet, he actually lost it carelessly. And Banglun's line of sight was also blocked by him, and Taike Ni came to his mind, rushed up with a kick, and the ball entered the empty goal, creating a 1-1 draw in the first half.

The Overseas Chinese Federation scored one goal in the second half

In the second half, the Overseas Chinese Federation replaced Yatuo Mali due to his injury. Tung Wah did not move at all. Although Zhang Banglun's right hand was injured from saving the ball, he still fought through the pain. The Righteous Generals relied on their abundant stamina and were determined to attack. Tung Wah exhausted their defensive efforts, taking care of each other and never leaking loopholes. However, due to the special strength of the opponent's central defense line, the offensive was mostly controlled by the feet of the Righteous Generals. Tung Wah also had many offensive opportunities, and Youliang's two allowances for space were unparalleled. Unfortunately, when Sun and Dai shot, they both went beyond, and they were very disappointed, which made people discouraged. Until twenty minutes, Bama Di Pan named Mei and Jin, Zhang Lingen was forced into a corner kick in a hurry. Di Pan named it very well, Zhang Lingen jumped up and headed it, but the ball was towards his own side, Banglun quickly patted it out, and it became a corner kick again. Di Pan named it again with wonderful feet, the landing point was extremely good, and Bao Jie headed it in the crowd, how could it not go in. The Righteous Army hugged each other, and their joy was indescribable. In the next fifteen minutes, although there were many killings and performances, Tung Wah also had two best opportunities. Youliang rushed into no man's land, and he could pull the door, but he was clever and became clumsy. With a flick, his foot was too heavy, and he ended up abandoning all his efforts. Finally, Mingzhe also made a fierce attempt to fight, which was quite skilled, but in the end, it was firmly caught by McNitty, which was a pity. Hastily ended, the Overseas Chinese Federation eliminated Tung Wah with a score of two to one.

Tung Wah's football skills are worthy of praise

Judging from the defeat of Tung Wah in this battle, it was supposed to have this score in terms of the strength of the offensive. But if you look closely at the loss of the two goals, they were all goals that should not have been lost. If Lin Gen didn't kick the first goal, Banglun could have caught it in time. The second goal was a corner kick again and again. When the strength and length were insufficient, it was expected that it would be a dangerous result. The loss of the corner kick. In terms of individuals, Zhang Banglun's performance has indeed made the most outstanding progress, and he cannot be blamed for the loss of the goal. In terms of defense, there was also success, with very few errors. Zhang Lingen's full court running is indispensable. However, the two goals lost were both Zhang's fault. The tacit understanding of the forwards and the application of small transmissions to attack is amazing, and Youliang is the most outstanding. Returning to defense and dribbling the ball, rushing forward fiercely, his edge is fully revealed. However, in the end, the opponent's goalkeeper McNitty's goal was difficult to break, and all his efforts were in vain. We cannot judge heroes by success or failure. Tung Wah's battle did not fail the expectations of thousands of fans

The Overseas Chinese Federation won the victory due to its strength

As for the Overseas Chinese Federation, it is difficult for me to find its most exquisite point. If there is one, it is only that it has abundant energy. The goalkeeper is special, and the central defense line has the skill of echoing each other. On the front line, there are very few outstanding players. The advantages of "transmission" and "transmission" are occasionally seen, and there are few methods for central breakthroughs. However, its ability to open corner kicks has half the hope, and it is also the result of stock training. Overall, since the Overseas Chinese Federation has defeated Tung Wah and fought the Shanghai Police, judging from its endurance, it may not create another upset and win this year's Municipal Mayor's Cup.

### Celebrating the Fifth Anniversary of the National Government's Return to the Capital, the East Asia and West Union Football Match

Yesterday was the fifth anniversary of the National Government's return to the capital. The Shanghai Branch of the Chinese News Association, with the support of the Football Association, specially invited the East Asia and West Union football teams to hold a football match at the Horse Racing Stadium at 10 am to celebrate. Tickets were not sold at all. Fans rushed to be the first to get in, and it was a very grand occasion. In addition to the competition, the ceremony was grand. First, Chen Binhe, the director of the Shanghai Branch of the New Association, delivered a speech, followed by a speech by Izumi Matsuji, the director of the Reporting Department. The navy music team played many famous songs. After Chen Binhe kicked off the ball, the two teams began the competition.

Chen Binhe kicked off

The East Asia team was mainly composed of the Chinese teams Hequn and Sansheng, and also included Meng Yiliang of the Huatong team, and two famous players, Matsuoka and Nishida, of the Qiulin team. The West Union was mostly composed of Shanghai Police athletes, supplemented by Italian goalkeeper Taiwan Erka and German merchant Remy Di. The strength of both sides was similar, and the competition was also meant to be a celebration, so they kicked very politely. The West Union was better in terms of contact. In the first half, Remy Di and Fafan Xiao scored two goals to lead 2-0. In the second half, the East Asia team worked hard and made progress. Lei Shicui lived up to expectations and pulled back a goal. Because the starting time was later, the competition time was shortened, with each half lasting twenty-five minutes. The West Union finally won 2-1.
