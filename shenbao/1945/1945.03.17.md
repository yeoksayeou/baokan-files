Editorial

### Industrialists Open Up a Way Out

Industrialists engage in business, generally with two objectives: one is to make a profit, and the other is to serve. Simply put, it is to benefit oneself and benefit others. In the business operation that involves maintaining these two objectives, one should maintain a balanced direction. Then this enterprise will inevitably develop and will inevitably last a long time. If the objective of making a profit exceeds the objective of serving, that is, only caring about one's own wealth and not caring about the convenience of the public, the result of the operation, even if their business develops and the individual succeeds, but their business does not have a solid position in the whole society, and there is no good impression in the eyes of the public. Therefore, at most, their life will be smooth, but the business itself will not last long. Moreover, because the business objective is more focused on making a profit, the treatment of workers will inevitably be reduced, and they will be unwilling to disclose asset profits. On the one hand, it is enough to prevent the progress of the enterprise, and on the other hand, it cannot get the sympathy of the society, all of which are factors that cannot last for a long time. Therefore, all far-sighted industrialists will inevitably adopt a business policy that benefits oneself and others.

Conversely, if the objective of serving exceeds the objective of making a profit, then under the current economic society of China and the country's ability to reward and assist enterprises, it is indeed difficult to maintain the existence of the enterprise itself and to store the capital to gradually expand. Therefore, we temporarily assume that public enterprises should have the objective of service exceeding the objective of profit, even completely for the purpose of service, while private enterprises should have the objective of service equal to the objective of profit.

We believe that the above discussion is the attitude that industrialists should have in operating enterprises today. Since half of the operation of an enterprise is for the purpose of service, then the enterprise cannot stop operating because of temporary environmental obstacles or unprofitable reasons. Furthermore, even under the circumstances of environmental obstacles or no profit, if it is for the purpose of achieving service, one must also overcome difficulties and open up a way out. Once one obtains continued operation, the objective of service can be achieved, and then the objective of profit can inevitably be achieved.

Shanghai has always been the national industrial and commercial center, that is, the concentration of industrialists operating enterprises. Now, due to power restrictions, raw material difficulties, transportation obstacles, etc., industrial production is in a state of stagnation, and financial commerce is following suit. In recent years, the profits of the industrial and commercial circles have been quite abundant, and their capital is strong. At the same time, in this decisive stage, not only can the above-mentioned reasons for the scale stagnation not be resolved temporarily, but there is also the possibility of repeated other wartime damages. Under the shifting of this situation, industrialists must not wait idly. In order to continue operating and lay the foundation for the future, they must seek a way to open up a way out.

Most of the industrial products in Shanghai are sold to the inland rural areas. Therefore, we advocate that the industrialists in Shanghai should immediately consider investing in various counties in the inland and establish small factories for various daily necessities. Utilize the local specialty raw materials. For example, Danyang County in Jiangsu Province produces glutinous rice, which can be used to set up an alcohol factory to extract alcohol. As for安置失业职工, alleviating the severity of social problems, it is especially important.

Our newspaper's February 24th editorial commented on industrial dispersion, and had already made some suggestions on the implementation of factory relocation. We believe that at this time, whether it is for the sake of the industrialists themselves or for the sake of the national economy, it is necessary to consider opening up a way out as soon as possible. Today's news reports the news that factories in various cities are relocating to Huaihai Province, which the Ministry is extremely concerned about. It is hoped that the competent authorities and people in the industrial sector will further discuss actively carrying out the method in order to realize it.

Factory Relocation Issue, Ministry of Industry and Commerce Researches Countermeasures; Governor Hao of Huaihai Province Expresses Welcome

Nanjing, 16th (Central News Agency dispatch) - Various civilian-use factories in Shanghai, Wuxi, Zhenjiang, Bengbu and other places are currently in a state of shutdown due to the difficulty of raw materials and insufficient power. On the contrary, Huaihai Province, known for its abundant raw material resources and coal, also cannot smoothly transport its products to the areas where various factories need them. This kind of malformed phenomenon is all due to the inability to unblock transportation problems. At present, increasing production, stabilizing the people's livelihood, and then enhancing combat power have become urgent. Therefore, all parties concerned have attached great importance to this issue and hope to seek a reasonable solution. Some people advocate relocating factories in Shanghai and other places to the Huaihai area to continue production. In this regard, Governor Hao expressed his views when he went to Beijing a few days ago, and decided to give full assistance and welcome all factories to relocate as soon as possible. It is reported that the authorities of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce are also very concerned about this and are actively studying specific countermeasures in order to realize them as soon as possible, so as to revitalize the industry. A few days ago, they also sent personnel to Shanghai and other places to ask for the opinions of various factories for reference.

### Chongqing Troops Massing on the Border of Annam

Guangzhou, 16th (Central News Agency dispatch) - News of Japanese troops searching for hostile forces in Vietnam has dealt a major blow to the Chongqing Anti-Japanese camp, and future trends are worth paying attention to.

Guangzhou, 16th (Central News Agency dispatch) - The 澮方's military operations approaching Annam along with material counterattacks are actively promoted, and its intentions are twofold: to cut off the north-south railway connecting mainland China and the south; to restore the blood transfusion route to Chiang Kai-shek's aid in Annam. Chongqing is also taking advantage of the weakness of Annam's military preparations, massing about ten divisions of troops on the Annam border to engage in threats. The power of France is also declining day by day. Chongqing has long coveted the rich resources of Annam, and is single-mindedly appeasing overseas Chinese in an attempt to squeeze their materials. In the future, its conspiracy will use preemptive means. As for Chongqing's attempt, the Japanese army will give a head-on blow. Therefore, all circles in Chongqing even speculate that the Japanese army's next strategy is to attack Kunming, and they are quite apprehensive.

### Churchill Expects European War to End Soon; Emphasizes Difficulties of War Against Japan

Stockholm, 16th (Central News Agency dispatch) - British Prime Minister Churchill attended the Conservative Party Congress on the 16th and gave a speech to about 2,000 party representatives. First, the battle against the German army is proceeding very smoothly, so the European war is expected to end soon. Next, he mentioned the counter-offensive operations in East Asia, saying that the war against the Japanese army is not limited by manpower resources, but is actually due to the shortage of ships, and transportation in the sea and dense forests is extremely difficult.

Stockholm, 16th (Central News Agency dispatch) - Reuters reported: Churchill declared at the Conservative Party Congress yesterday: Before the end of the European War, if I am ordered to organize a new cabinet again, I will establish a "mixed government" again. For the sake of gathering British talents, I will not only recruit Conservative Party members, but also 网罗 outstanding talents from all parties. Almost all administrative talents can be selected at the same time. If the people of the country still want us to be in power after the next election, the government will gradually reform.

### American Reinforcements Between the Ruhr and Saar Rivers

Berlin, 16th (Central News Agency dispatch) - Reuters reported: The American army has established several bridgeheads downstream of the Moselle River. American reinforcements have arrived between the Ruhr and Saar rivers, advancing eastward, and the fighting is intensifying. The American bridgehead between Honnef and Honningen on the east bank of the Rhine is now 17 kilometers wide and 8 kilometers deep, with five divisions of troops gathered under a special army. The enemy is trying to expand at both the north and south ends of the bridgehead, but has encountered strong resistance from the German army.

### In Order to Cope with the Decisive War, We Must Persist With Perseverance; Dr. Goebbels Publishes a Paper

Berlin, 16th (Central News Agency dispatch) - The German News Agency reported that German Propaganda Minister Goebbels wrote in the national weekly that the main task of each war is to distinguish between strong and weak countries and enable the fittest to survive. A country that does not achieve success in wartime will have no possibility of further development, and the victor will gain more opportunities. In order to cope with this decisive period, we must persevere. If there are mistakes in the early stages of the war, they can still be remedied. Mistakes at the end of the war are irreparable. Both sides of the war are doing their best to engage in the final battle. Those who can disregard everything and fight for the most favorable peace will have the highest chance of winning.

### German Army Takes Advantage of Opportunity to Strengthen Berlin's Defense

Zurich, 16th (Central News Agency dispatch) - According to a Moscow report, Germany, which is actively promoting defense work, is now appointing General Berdenbrunner as the commander-in-chief of the Berlin front. According to the general, he is Austrian and has served as a security committee member of Austria. He is a confidant of Himmler's internal army commander.

Stockholm, 16th (Central News Agency dispatch) - Reuters reported: The situation is becoming increasingly tense on the front line of the Soviet army's attack on Berlin to the Treuenbrietzen area.

### Chongqing Spokesman Claims Riots in Xinjiang

Central News Agency dispatch - According to information received from a certain party, Chongqing spokesman Jiang Tingfu issued a statement on the 14th saying that the riots in Xinjiang Province are indeed a fact, but the matter of the Cossacks occupying a vast area has not yet been confirmed. The American report that Chiang Kai-shek will attend the San Francisco conference is inaccurate, because the National Congress will be held in Chongqing on May 6, and Chiang must attend the meeting and cannot leave the country.

### Battle Situation of Japanese Garrison on Iwo Jima

The continuous attacks on the Japanese mainland by the U.S. mobile force are a cover operation for the landing operations on Iwo Jima, which shows that the strategic value of Iwo Jima is extremely important in the enemy's view. For this small island, they did not hesitate to invest a large amount of steel, and after a fierce bombardment, the U.S. military began to land. What kind of island is this Iwo Jima in the midst of a fierce battle? How do the defenders on the island fight?

Not a Single Blade of Grass Grows

The circumference of Iwo Jima is only a little over ten kilometers, and unlike the Philippines, Taiwan, and Saipan, the entire island is sandy land formed by volcanic ash. The crater on the island still emits white smoke, and due to geothermal heat, the wind blowing from the sea immediately covers the entire island like hot air, giving people the feeling of being in a Turkish bath. Therefore, food is extremely easy to spoil, and storage is completely impossible. The drinking water on the island is, of course, filtered seawater, but it must be boiled before it can be used, so rainwater is also collected for drinking. When we first arrived on this island, we tried to dig a well and take water, and found hot springs near the crater. At that time, everyone was overjoyed and jumped down, but who knew that the whole body immediately seemed to be immersed in glue, similar to being greasy, and even the hair was knotted together. Because of the excessive salt content, this kind of hot spring is of no use at all, and as a result, no one has ever taken a bath to this day. Moreover, there are not many trees on the island. In addition to using geothermal heat, cooking and boiling can only be done by drying the unknown weeds on Yepeng Island and using them as fuel. Now, due to the bombing and fierce bombing by airplanes, the entire island has changed its appearance, and there is simply not a single blade of grass left. However, the morale of the entire Japanese garrison is still extremely high, and everyone is full of enthusiasm, as fiery as the flames of a volcano. The only things they eat daily are pickled plums and salted radishes. The vegetables planted in the open space have also failed to be harvested due to bombing. Moreover, around this "scorching hell," enemy submarines are often lurking to hinder supplies, and large enemy planes patrol the sky, closely monitoring Japanese actions. Therefore, whenever supply ships or planes pass through the enemy's cordon and arrive at Iwo Jima, the garrison is very happy and quickly unloads the cargo to prevent the valuable supplies from becoming victims of shells and bombs in vain.

The U.S. Military Spares No Expense

The U.S. military's bombing of this small island can be said to spare no expense. As for its air control method, the aircraft groups are generally divided into two echelons. If one echelon enters from an altitude of about 5,000 meters, the altitude of the other echelon must be 7-8,000 meters in order to unexpectedly attack the Japanese air defense forces. When reaching the airspace above the target, they drop bombs and strafe horizontally and vertically. There is simply no gap. The interval between the bomb craters is extremely small. The ash and sand dug up by one bomb often buries the large hole created by another bomb. By the time the U.S. planes retreat, the ground is like a raging sea with undulating waves. There are only countless sand dunes stretching endlessly, which is completely different from the scene after an air raid that we usually imagine. The invading enemy planes always come at 10:00 AM every day with about 30 Grumman, Consolidated, and B-29s. At night, there is often one or two B-29s flying at an altitude of about 4,000 meters to drop bombs.

The Japanese Military's Determination to Defend

In short, there is very little that can be used on Iwo Jima. When digging into the ground, seawater will gush out before too deep, so it is absolutely impossible to dig a satisfactory trench. And because of the geothermal heat, the wind blowing is unbearably hot, so you have to expose your whole body on the ground and fight the invading enemy. The hardship of the garrison can be said to be even greater than Guadalcanal. But the morale of the entire army is not weakened at all. The determination to defend Iwo Jima to the death is revealed on the pale faces of every soldier. (Special Correspondent Toda) (Translated from the February 21st Mainichi Shimbun)

### Fierce Street Fighting in Mandalay - Japanese Garrison Launches an Ambush - Major Victory on the Irrawaddy Line

Central News Agency Telegram from the Burmese Frontline Base, 16th. The main force of the enemy's 19th Division, in response to the enemy troops invading Meiktila, advanced south of Mandalay on the east bank of the Irrawaddy River.

The Japanese army immediately launched an ambush, inflicting heavy damage on the enemy and trying to repel them to the north. However, on the 10th, the enemy troops, with tanks and armored vehicles as the vanguard, gradually began to invade the northern part of the city and engaged in fierce street fighting with the Japanese garrison. Especially in the Wangcheng area, the Japanese army strictly defended their strong positions. Since the 9th, fierce battles have continued all day long, repelling the enemy troops. Subsequently, on the 11th, the battles around the city gradually intensified. A part of the enemy forces, with five tanks, detoured and invaded the northern part of the city. After being ambushed by the Japanese army, they were given a great damage that afternoon and were repelled. At present, Wangcheng and the southern side of Mandalay Hill are still secured by the Japanese army, and a fierce attack is being launched on the enemy troops around the city.

Central News Agency Telegram from the Burmese Frontline, 15th. Fierce battles continue in various places on the Irrawaddy battle line. The enemy has suffered heavy losses under the fierce attacks of the Japanese army. Since the Japanese army began operations on the Irrawaddy on December 1st, the results achieved up to March 15th are as follows: more than 17,000 enemies killed, 167 tanks burned, 72 aircraft shot down, 278 trucks burned, 21 armored vehicles destroyed or burned, 127 heavy and light machine guns destroyed or captured, 27 mortars captured, 194 automatic rifles captured, 162 boats and a lot of ammunition.

### Ministry of Finance Reviews Listed Stocks - Bans Over-the-Counter Trading - Strictly Enforces Regulations

Since the Shanghai Chinese Securities Exchange was placed under the direct supervision and management of the Ministry of Finance, the original Supervisory Committee of the Exchange was abolished, and the Office of the Ministry of Finance's Shanghai Securities Exchange Supervisor was established, with Bi Zhishuo, Deputy Minister of Finance, still appointed as the Chief Supervisor. The office earnestly reviews the contents of the listed stock companies and supervises the trading activities of brokers in the market, and bans over-the-counter trading by brokers. A Central News Agency reporter recently learned from the Office of the Securities Exchange Supervisor that the office has decided to strictly review listed stocks in accordance with the Rules for Reviewing Listed Stocks on the Shanghai Securities Exchange. Where stocks lose the possibility of free trading, the company's content changes and does not match the original application for listing, the company's business is sluggish and the capital is depleted, and the stock market price falls below the par value, the exchange shall apply to the Supervisor's Office, or the office shall directly order the exchange to suspend or cancel its listing. If the company can remedy the situation in the shortest possible time, it can apply to the Supervisor's Office for verification and temporary exemption from suspension of trading or delisting, but in cases where the circumstances are serious and harm the public interest, no application may be made.

For the prohibition of over-the-counter trading, special regulations have been made for the temporary measures for brokers to handle transactions. If a broker has customers buying and selling the same type of stock at the same time, they may settle the transaction within the broker's firm in accordance with the regulations of the exchange. However, they should apply to the Supervisor's Office for approval in advance, submit the application to the Ministry of Finance for filing, and request the exchange to issue the prescribed vouchers and books. The type and amount of stocks handled by the broker, as well as the transaction taxes collected, should be listed and categorized to the Supervisor's Office and the exchange the next day. If a broker handles transactions without approval, they will be punished in accordance with the prohibition of over-the-counter trading and fined accordingly.

### Ningbo Native Place Association Assists the Evacuation of the Population

The Ningbo Native Place Association in this city is now actively persuading fellow villagers who do not need to stay in Shanghai to return to their hometowns in order to assist in the evacuation of the population in this city. The association will start registering fellow villagers and natives from yesterday (16th) and will be responsible for handling boat tickets and escorting them along the way. It is found that the population of Shanghai is mostly from Ningbo, accounting for more than 45% of the highest record. At present, the cost of living in Ningbo is one to two times lower than in this city.

### Pacific Anglo-American Fleets: Friction Increasingly Evident; Minister Matsushima Elucidates Recent Battle Situation

The Allied Japanese Fleet in China's Press Department reported, as usual, that yesterday afternoon a gathering was held at the Restaurant Bay Hydrographic Society. Minister Matsushima, Lieutenant Matsumoto, and reporters from various newspapers attended. Minister Matsushima first elaborated on the battles of Iwo Jima, the Philippines, and the Pacific. He explained in detail the discord between the Anglo-American fleets in the Pacific and the difficulties in the future of the war. After the meeting, a convivial banquet was held for the reporters. The main points of Minister Matsushima's speech are recorded below:

Japanese Troops on Iwo Jima Offer Stiff Resistance

On Iwo Jima, the fierce fighting between the two sides is still centered on the north coast. The enemy is using tanks and flamethrowers to fiercely attack Japanese positions. The Japanese troops are in fortified defensive caves, using artillery and new weapons to offer stiff resistance, annihilating the attacking enemy. On the eighth day, the Japanese troops repeatedly set out from their positions, charging into the enemy's lines, attacking the enemy fiercely. The enemy's casualties exceeded three thousand, and several tanks were destroyed. A great deal of weapons and supplies were captured. According to enemy sources, an average of 250 wounded soldiers are transported daily from the Iwo Jima airfield to hospitals in Hawaii. Based on this figure, the extent of enemy casualties can be imagined. Therefore, according to enemy claims, the battle of Iwo Jima is the most brutal war in the Pacific. In the future, the Japanese troops will cause the enemy to bleed even more heavily, which the enemy cannot avoid.

Enemy Air Raids Ineffective

Recently, enemy American forces have continued to bomb the Japanese mainland, repeatedly bombing Tokyo, Nagoya, and Osaka on the 11th, 12th, and 14th. According to enemy sources, the total number of aircraft used in the raids exceeded five hundred. However, this kind of air raid can only damage a portion of civilian housing and has no effect on enhancing combat power. According to Japanese investigations, the number of aircraft attacking was 150 on the 10th, 130 on the 12th, and 140 on the 14th, gradually decreasing, totaling approximately 350. Of this number, 52 were shot down by Japanese troops, and 170 were damaged, totaling 222, which accounted for 63% of the total number. In other words, it equals two months of production of the enemy's B-29 type aircraft. The enemy claims that the air raids on the Japanese mainland have caused considerable losses to the Japanese side, but in fact, all major production facilities have already been relocated and evacuated. In Tokyo, only some civilian residences have been affected. Even if the enemy could turn Tokyo into ashes, it would still not be able to damage the necessary factories in the slightest. The result of the enemy's three air raids was the destruction of two months' worth of their own aircraft production. Therefore, the enemy will inevitably face many difficulties in future operations. Moreover, the Japanese people have suffered many natural disasters and major fires in the past, and they have become accustomed to it. The civilian population does not feel particularly difficult even if they lose some housing due to air raids. The enemy's proclaimed scorched-earth policy is of no help. The Japanese people do not feel it is serious. Instead, it gives ordinary people the opportunity to build new houses. Thank you Americans, especially President Roosevelt.

American Troops in the Philippines Unable to Move

In the Philippines, fierce fighting is taking place in the mountainous areas east of Manila, such as Batayan and Montalban, as well as in Zamboanga in Mindanao. The Montalban mountainous areas of Luzon Island are particularly fierce, and a major battle may be triggered. Regardless of how the battle is fought, the Japanese side's greatest objective is to make the enemy bleed. The Japanese troops are engaged in the war with a consistent style. The twenty divisions of troops deployed by the enemy have already been bogged down. The Japanese troops are containing their forces, making it impossible for them to move and preventing them from engaging in the second phase of the operation.

Opportunity to Annihilate Enemy Fleet is Near

Regarding the movements of the enemy fleet in the Marianas, this is also something that we urgently want to know. Their air raids on Taiwan and Okinawa are also related to this battle situation. The Japanese side is paying close attention to this in the battle situation. Last time, Minister of the Navy Yonai stated at a cabinet meeting that the best opportunity to annihilate the enemy was about to arrive, which has great significance. The results achieved by the Japanese Kamikaze attack teams in the Battle of Peleliu are a prelude to annihilating the enemy. Therefore, reducing the enemy is near.

Anglo-American Fleets Unable to Cooperate

The contradictions and internal friction between the Anglo-American fleets in the Pacific are becoming increasingly evident. Recently, London and New York have often issued statements regarding the future movements of the British fleet, especially statements by Nimitz and Halsey. Based on the statements of these two, we feel that a great mystery is hidden between the British and American navies. Extrapolating, it can be said that the British fleet is weak, the British fleet's actions are passive, and the United States is unwilling to provide the British fleet with bases. Under these kinds of hidden reefs, how the Anglo-American Pacific fleets will unfold their situation in the future is an extremely interesting question. We assert that the result is that the United States has the ambition to dominate the Pacific after the war. On the one hand, Britain wants to protect its original maritime interests, and on the other hand, it does not care that its fleet will be damaged in combat. With these kinds of contradictory phenomena between the British and Americans, can they cooperate in the war? Based on this point, it can be seen that Anglo-American operations are not for their own interests but a struggle for interests. Thinking about the future of Greater East Asia, what will the future be like if the enemy lands, extends its claws, and realizes the struggle for interests? Therefore, we must strive to annihilate the enemy.
