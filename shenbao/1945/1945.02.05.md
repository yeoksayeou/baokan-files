### The Enemy Forces Advancing South in Luzon Are Now in an Isolated State; Enemy Troops Landing at Nasugbu Suffered Heavy Losses

Luzon Front, Japanese Base, 4th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – Enemy forces advancing south in Luzon, fearing a flanking attack by Japanese forces in the Bangasinan Plain, are continuing their offensive against Japanese positions in the Canossa and Rosary areas. On the 31st, enemy forces attempted to invade the highlands of northeastern Luzon but were repulsed by Japanese forces. On the 1st, under heavy artillery cover, the enemy attacked again with two companies. The Japanese responded with a night attack on the 2nd, throwing the enemy into chaos and forcing them to retreat. In the Umin-Gakon area, an enemy battalion with five tanks and multiple artillery pieces reinforced its defenses in the northwest on the 30th and 31st. These defenses were also destroyed by Japanese close-combat assault teams. The confirmed results of the battle by the 31st included the destruction of one 15-centimeter howitzer, one automatic cannon, three mortars, two towing vehicles, two trucks, and the capture of one truck-mounted machine gun, one heavy machine gun, one light machine gun, and twenty-six automatic rifles. Several ammunition depots were also set ablaze. In the Monyos area, a Japanese advancing assault team continued to attack enemy forces on the 1st. Meanwhile, Japanese forces around Clark Field remained firmly entrenched, threatening the enemy's southward advance, engaging in fierce artillery and bayonet battles. As a result, a portion of the enemy forces that had penetrated southern San Fernando faced severe supply difficulties from the Lingayen Gulf bridgehead, leading to the isolation of the southward advancing troops. The landings at Subic Bay and Nasugbu were being reinforced, and the leading elements of the enemy forces that landed at Nasugbu attempted to break through east of Nasugbu on the 1st. Local Japanese forces fiercely resisted, inflicting heavy losses, and fighting is still ongoing.

Berlin, 4th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – Hitherto, naval correspondent Saar-Vachert noted: In the ongoing landing operations in the Philippines, in addition to the US fleet, British, French, and Italian warships are participating, demonstrating that the United States cannot independently confront the Japanese fleet.

Enemy Forces Use Their Usual Tactic of Driving Filipinos as Cannon Fodder

Luzon Front, 4th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – Since landing in Lingayen Gulf, the enemy has been indiscriminately bombing hospitals, schools, and temples everywhere, revealing increasingly blatant acts of brutality and illegality. According to reports from Japanese close-combat assault teams, the enemy is deploying a significant number of indigenous troops to the front lines of Japanese attacks, using them as sacrifices. Among the leading elements of enemy forces that have penetrated near Clark, there are also many indigenous troops. These indigenous troops are often forced to engage in hopeless battles at the forefront, and these unarmed indigenous people lack proper equipment, with some even fighting with wooden guns. Three years ago, when Japanese forces initiated decisive operations in the Philippines, the cowardly American forces ordered indigenous troops to face the Japanese guns, while they retreated to the second line to enjoy a comfortable life, ultimately abandoning the indigenous people and fleeing to their homeland. This is a well-known fact. This time, in the Lingayen Gulf landing operation, they are again using their usual tactics, deceiving or intimidating loyal indigenous people under the leadership of President Laurel into betraying their country and sacrificing themselves under Japanese fire.

Editorial

### Self-Restraint in the Business Community

In the editorial on the 2nd of this month, the issue of strengthening trade associations was raised. We believe that strengthening trade associations will have a significant effect on suppressing prices and preventing hoarding, and will also be beneficial to the wartime economy and controlled economy. Strengthening trade associations is to promote the unity of the business community, using collective strength to seek the normal development of their own interests, and to fulfill their individual responsibilities to bring the entire economy into order.

However, strengthening trade associations must start with individual self-restraint in the business community. Every member of a trade association must have a sound personality and a sense of commercial ethics that takes into account both public and private interests. Only then can a trade association formed by a collection of such members be strengthened. In particular, leaders in the business community, who are in a leading position, should set an example for the group. If the members of a trade association are only concerned with their own interests and disregard public interests, or if a few business leaders only seek to pursue exorbitant profits, then the association may very well become a criminal group that defends the interests of its members. We must frankly review the past inside stories of some business circles and the actual situation of trade associations. Whether it is beneficial or harmful to the entire economy cannot but be regarded as a very big question.

Since Mayor Zhou took office, he has first taken suppressing prices and stabilizing people's livelihood as the goal of his administration. All kinds of incidents that stimulate price fluctuations and cause unrest to people's livelihood must be rectified one by one. In the past two weeks, the atmosphere has changed. We believe that this is the turning point of Shanghai's municipal administration, and it is also the stage of sorting out right and wrong. In other words, it is an opportunity for self-restraint of officials and the people. As far as the business community is concerned, the past pursuit of exorbitant profits and disregard of public interests will absolutely not be allowed to continue to inflict abuse in the future. Now is the opportunity for self-restraint and correction. If the abuse continues and the opportunity for self-restraint is missed, then the day of reckoning will never be lenient. Rather than ruining your reputation, it is better to exercise self-restraint from now on.

What business people, especially some leaders in various industries, should restrain themselves from most importantly is not pursuing exorbitant profits. Industry and commerce are indeed for the purpose of profit, but the so-called profit refers to reasonable profit, and exorbitant profit is definitely not reasonable profit. Furthermore, the following two matters must also be corrected with self-restraint:

(1) In the past, various industries often lobbied the competent authorities to request price increases, and obtained permission by means of bribery. However, the expenses paid by business people for bribery will never be a total loss. As the saying goes, "The wool comes from the sheep." As a result, it is completely passed on to ordinary customers. This is of course also a phenomenon of corruption in government agencies, but the business community opens the door to bribery for private interests by catering to its preferences. The crime under the criminal law is equal. In the future, the business community should immediately be self-disciplined and no longer use bribery as a tool to facilitate private interests. If there are reasons and necessity for requesting price increases, they can be submitted in accordance with legal procedures. If the competent authorities deliberately make things difficult, they can also file a complaint according to the law.

(2) Evading tax obligations is also a common phenomenon in the business community. Now the municipal finance authorities have repeatedly expressed their intention to rectify tax collection. The donations and taxes payable by the business community should be truthfully paid. In the past, many small-scale stores charged customers for consumption special taxes but did not remit them, which was tantamount to opening up a way for these people to make a fortune. At that time, there were also many malpractices in the tax collection agencies, with collusion and fraud. Now that the authorities are determined to rectify the situation, it is hoped that the business community will also exercise self-restraint and never evade the donations and taxes that should be paid.

### Four-Province Border Region Organizes Pacification Army

Xuchang (Central News Agency Dispatch) – The Pacification Director's Office of the Border Region of the Four Provinces of Henan, Shaanxi, Hubei, and Anhui was established in Xuchang on September 1st of last year. The organization of the office includes nine departments: staff, secretariat, political affairs, political training, adjutant, military supplies, pacification, ordnance, and transportation, as well as two committees for communist suppression and economy. Pacification work focuses on military affairs.

### Closing Ceremony of the Capital Students' Life Camp; Chairman Chen of the New Life Movement Association Bestows Instructions

Nanjing, 4th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – The closing ceremony of the Second Winter Vacation Life Camp for Students, organized by the Chinese Youth Model Corps Work-and-Study Practice Association, was held at 2:00 PM on the 4th. Officials present included Vice Secretary-General Xu of the New Life Movement Association and more than 100 campers. After the ceremony, the leader gave instructions. Chairman Chen, because of pressing matters, sent Vice Secretary-General Xu of the New Life Movement Association to deliver the instructions on his behalf. All the campers listened respectfully and were very moved. The ceremony ended at around 4:00 PM. Afterwards, Vice Secretary-General Xu led the campers to Chairman Chen's official residence to pay their respects. Chairman Chen received them personally. The camp representatives respectfully presented a tribute, and Chairman Chen gave instructions and pointed out the direction of future work, commending the spirit of the campers. They left the official residence and returned to the camp at 6:00 PM. The instructions of Chairman Chen are recorded as follows:

Original Text of the Instructions

Fellow youths of the capital, enduring the severe cold, working hard and enduring hardship, completing three weeks of life training, your spirit is extremely admirable. You all came to the life camp voluntarily. After participating, based on the spirit of youth leading youth, everything in the camp is managed and trained by yourselves. At the same time, you all do your best, unite and help each other. I believe that what you have gained in this week is greater than the effect of training in the original school for three months or even three years.

Why are you willing to accept this kind of training? Because you need to accept this kind of training. Since the death of the leader, the world war situation has become more and more serious. The Greater East Asia War has reached the stage of decisive battle. The people of China, the youths who are the backbone of the Chinese people, must contribute and concentrate their strength in order to save the dying motherland and defend East Asia in the war of liberation. The general youth can understand the great significance of revitalizing China and protecting Asia, so they need to train themselves more and enrich themselves, so everyone is vigorously accepting training, rushing to accept training.

The future of China is optimistic, and the future of East Asia is bright, because the spirit of Chinese youth is still vigorous. You are the representatives of the youths of the capital, and you are the representatives of the youths of China. Not afraid of wind, frost, rain, and snow, bravely forging ahead, the more training, the stronger the will, the more training, the greater the strength.

The life camp's proposal of the work-study movement is very meaningful. The general problem of the Chinese people is that they are sloppy and perfunctory, advocating empty talk and unwilling to do things practically. You have three weeks of hard work and practical life training. I hope that after leaving the camp, you will always maintain this spirit of hard work, and spread the spirit of hard work to every Chinese youth and every Chinese citizen. Everyone can follow the leader's instructions, bury themselves in practical work, develop new movements, complete the war, and build a young China for Chinese youths and a young East Asia for East Asian youths!

Travel Correspondence

### Visiting Sun Liangcheng in Yangzhou

— Special Correspondent of this Newspaper, Danming

After staying for a day, I learned from the locals that there were two lawless places: the train station and the riverside dock. Therefore, I specifically requested the county government to send a policeman to accompany me across the river. I went to the riverside dock and indeed saw several officials from the sealed-off management office collecting money from passengers. Because I had a policeman escorting me, I was not bothered.

Journey Between Zhenjiang and Yangzhou

Travelers going from Zhenjiang to Yangzhou mostly cross the river to Liuwei, and then take a long-distance bus or passenger car to the outskirts of the city. However, some people take inland river steamers directly to Yangzhou. The inland river steamers depart from 10:00 or 11:00 AM. Because the tugboat tows more than ten barges, it takes until the evening to arrive in Yangzhou. So, unless it's raining or snowing, travelers prefer to take the bus, even though passenger cars charge exorbitant prices, and long-distance buses are difficult to buy tickets for and prone to breakdowns. The ferry from the riverside in Zhenjiang to Liuwei takes only half an hour and is under the jurisdiction of the China Steamship Company, but the fare is also quite expensive, requiring 300 yuan per person. Because I had a policeman accompanying me, I received half-price treatment (actually 200 yuan). However, it is said that it is still not easy for ordinary passengers to buy tickets! The ship departed at 10:30 AM and arrived in Liuwei at 11:00 AM. Because it had snowed again the day before, the long-distance bus was still broken down on the way and did not run today. Ordinary passengers had to scramble to take passenger cars. However, the price of passenger cars was unexpectedly high. Although the journey was only three-quarters of an hour, the drivers asked for 5,000 yuan per person, and finally settled for 3,000 yuan. At least eight or nine people sit in one car, so one or two people sit on the hood as well, truly a novel idea for car passengers. The rural scenery of the suburbs of Yangzhou passed by the car window. I thought if it were a sunny day in March, the weeping willows would surely provide ample shade, with a strong Jiangnan flavor.

Around noon, the car stopped at the long-distance bus station outside Yangzhou. Passengers got off one by one, crossed the pontoon bridge (made of boats) over the Grand Canal, and then walked into the city. I immediately took a military vehicle to the Northern Jiangsu Pacification Commissioner's Office to visit Mr. Sun Liangcheng, Commander-in-Chief of the Second Front Army and Pacification Commissioner of Northern Jiangsu.

The Situation of Communist Suppression

Mr. Sun was as simple and unadorned as ever. His house was also very simple. I think that among the important figures in the military and political affairs of today, there are probably very few who live as frugally as Mr. Sun. It is a blessing for Northern Jiangsu, and even the whole country, that the excellent traditions of the Northwest Army can continue to grow in our ranks of peaceful national construction! Mr. Sun immediately invited me to lunch, and we talked after the meal because he was leaving for Gongzhou tomorrow, so we had to be quick.

"Mr. Danming, you are new to Northern Jiangsu, I am afraid that you do not fully understand the situation in Northern Jiangsu, let me give you a general idea!" he began. He continued, "Northern Jiangsu has always been regarded by the New Fourth Army and the Eighth Route Army as a base for development. Therefore, the worse the politics of Northern Jiangsu, and even the more undisciplined the National Army stationed in Northern Jiangsu, the more successful they will be. The military and political circles in Northern Jiangsu in the past should bear some responsibility for the situation in Northern Jiangsu today."

"Under the slogan of 'clearing the fields and strengthening the walls', the Communist Party not only demolished all the houses, but also encompassed all the people and property. Under their rule, the people only have two paths: 'those who obey me live, those who resist me die'. They do not allow you to say anything. If the people have any complaints, they will be executed alive, and they will be shown to everyone as an example. You think, in this state of oppressing the people, what democracy can be spoken of?"

"Otherwise, the people of Northern Jiangsu would not have welcomed us. When our army arrived, people everywhere lit incense to welcome us."

"Just imagine, in the past bandit dens of Yancheng, Funing, and Dongtai, most of the cities were empty, and even the bricks and tiles of the demolished houses were ground into fine pieces to prevent people from living there again after they passed through. How can this kind of intention be tolerated by heaven and earth?"

"Then, are there not also National Army troops stationed there?" I asked.

"The suffering of the people of Northern Jiangsu is for this reason," Mr. Sun frankly said, "A national army that has no discipline is worse than none. In the past, some unprogressive troops used 'protection tickets' as a shortcut to get rich. How can the people of Northern Jiangsu ask this kind of army to protect them?"

"This is not just what I say," Mr. Sun added, "When we entered Northern Jiangsu from Henan, we received so many accusations from the people against the local stationed troops along the way. And in the welcome meetings in various places, I personally saw people wearing the same uniforms as the local stationed troops who had been kidnapped. Don't you think that is strange?"

"Then," I changed the subject, "Did the Commander-in-Chief engage in any battles with the New Fourth Army along the way when he led the army south?"

"Yes," he said, "Once near Guanyun, we initially heard that the other side had 100 regiments, but in reality, there were dozens of regiments participating in blocking us, but they were all defeated by us. When we approached Zhuoyun, we received intelligence that they were preparing to intercept us along the way, because they believed that our army's transfer to Northern Jiangsu was a serious threat to them, so they did not hesitate to use all their strength to block us. Although their momentum was very fierce, I thought they came at the right time. The army is for eliminating violence and pacifying the people for the country, so we all fought one against a hundred. For example, there was another time near Funing, where an even bigger battle broke out. As a result, they had never abandoned their weapons on the battlefield before, but this time they lost two or three hundred pieces of equipment."

"Are the weapons of the New Fourth Army good?" I couldn't help but ask him.

"Sometimes they are very good," Mr. Sun replied, "The ones we seized that time were the military equipment they had snatched from the Yu Army."

"How active is the New Fourth Army in Northern Jiangsu now?" I asked.

"Of course, they are still everywhere," Mr. Sun replied, "But I have made up my mind to protect the area and prepare to deal with them with all my strength. I heard that the bandits who fought with us in Funing last time are now trying to cross the river to the south. Therefore, Northern Jiangsu's value as a barrier along the Beijing-Shanghai line is very significant."

"I wonder how the Commander-in-Chief will reorganize Northern Jiangsu?" I asked.

Reforming Military and Political Affairs

"The reason why Northern Jiangsu was bad in the past," Mr. Sun immediately replied, "First, there were Communist troops everywhere; second, the politics were corrupt; and third, the stationed troops were disturbing the people. Now, if we want to suppress the Communists, we cannot rely solely on military force, so we must first rectify local politics and eliminate the bad stationed troops."

"How will you improve the military and political affairs of Northern Jiangsu?" I asked eagerly.

"I have never advocated killing people," Mr. Sun said with a smile, "But in this chaotic world, if killing one can serve as a warning to a hundred, it is also an advisable method. Therefore, I plan to increase the treatment of all parties in the military and political fields, and then convene a joint military and political conference to ask all parties to sign the regulations I have made and swear not to act improperly or fraudulently again. If there is any misconduct, I will resolutely handle it strictly in accordance with the agreement, and even execute them."

"There are many people who advocate using severe penalties now," Mr. Sun added, "But I will first consider the poor lives of the general middle and lower-level military and political personnel, solve all their difficulties, and then implement severe penalties."

"According to you," I asked, "Before reforming the military and political affairs of Northern Jiangsu, you must have a large amount of funds. Where will you get them from?"

"Northern Jiangsu is very rich," Mr. Sun said, "In the past, they all went into the pockets of a few people. If we can distribute the money that went into private pockets to those who serve loyally, it will be more than enough."

"I wonder how the Commander-in-Chief will train your cadres?"

"My cadres are the Second Front Army," he said, "I told them that you are like a chaste virgin, but now you have come to this Northern Jiangsu, which is full of bad habits, just like setting foot in a world of evil for the first time. There are demons with hideous faces on all sides enticing you to do evil, so you must guard against them strictly. Now they have been here for several months, but to be frank, they have all kept my instructions."

A Glimpse of Yangzhou

I talked with Mr. Sun for more than an hour. Because there were many military and political figures waiting outside to see Mr. Sun, I stood up and said goodbye. Mr. Sun saw me off to the door before shaking hands and parting. Then, Director Liu of the Propaganda Department invited me to stay at the Green Willow Hotel. The name of this hotel sounds very nice, but it is actually only in name. However, even so, it is the leading hotel in Yangzhou. Later, we disregarded the muddy roads and went to the streets to sightsee. Probably the most bustling areas are around Church Street, Xingsheng Street, and Su Chang Street, and the famous residences are all in the Brick Street area. However, Jiangdu County is not like the cities in the Beijing-Shanghai area, which have gradually adopted modern colors in the past one or two decades. It still retains the atmosphere of the Middle Ages. Not only are the streets narrow, but the roads paved with stone strips are considered the best. Yangzhou's enjoyment is famous; like the Yangzhou bathhouses, the four, five, and six snacks, and the dim sum of Fuchun are all considered special to this area. As for hotels, in addition to the Green Willow Hotel, there is also a place called the Yangzhou Apartment, which is relatively clean and has Chinese and Western restaurants attached, so if a traveler can stay there, it is more comfortable, but unfortunately there are not many rooms and it is not easy to get one.

### Secretary-General Luo Discusses Evacuating the City's Population – Population Evacuation Committee to be Established Next Week

Mr. Luo Junqiang, Secretary-General of the Shanghai Municipal Government, met with reporters on the 3rd to discuss the issue of Shanghai's population evacuation, as follows: Mayor Zhou stated at a meeting with reporters on January 30th that the Shanghai population evacuation committee will be organized soon, scheduled to be formed by the Municipal Government, the Shanghai Citizen Welfare Association, and civil groups, and will be established next week. The committee's temporary expenses will be paid from the municipal budget, with 160 million yuan allocated for evacuation subsidies. The purpose of evacuating citizens is to defend against enemy air raids and to evacuate unnecessary personnel to various places due to shortages of food, daily necessities, and fuel. The Municipal Government hopes to evacuate a total of one million people, but the difficulties of evacuation are: (1) inconvenient transportation; (2) poor local security, especially after the lower class citizens are evacuated, their lives are unsustainable, and they turn into vagrants. The target of evacuation is the empty houses in the county seat. It is expected that a concrete plan will be announced next week.

### Municipal Finance Bureau Strictly Punishes Tax Evasion – Two Entertainment Venues Fined

Since Mr. Luo, concurrent director of the Municipal Finance Bureau, took office, he has been determined to rectify tax revenue, on the one hand preventing corruption by tax collectors, and on the other hand investigating various tax evasion facts by businesses, and strictly cracking down on them. Recently, it was reported that entertainment venues often use tricks to evade entertainment taxes, in an attempt to evade taxes. The bureau immediately sent personnel to conduct secret investigations. It was heard that the Great China Shenqu Theater did not tear off the ticket stubs when selling tickets to the audience at the venue, but allowed the audience to bring the original tickets in. Before the end of the play, the ticket collectors collected all the tickets as unsold tickets, as the basis for concealing and evading entertainment taxes when reporting the entertainment tax the next day. After the secret investigators detained the collected tickets and extra seats tickets and reported them to the bureau, a fine of 277,200 yuan was imposed. In addition, the Xianyue Dance Hall was found to have issued gift certificates (i.e., dance tickets) without date stamps on January 14 this year, and the date stamps affixed to the gift certificates issued on January 21 were blurred and unrecognizable, all of which were deliberately evading taxes in violation of regulations. A fine of 155,000 yuan was imposed. The penalties have been executed separately, and personnel have been sent to continue secret investigations, so that taxpayers or collection venues will be vigilant.

### Order at the North Station Gradually Improving

The Municipal Police Bureau, in view of the fact that the North Railway Station is the only major transportation hub in the city, with tens of thousands of passengers coming and going every day, and in the past, black marketeers and other station staff extorted and harassed passengers, which is beyond description, decided to start reorganizing the station in order to thoroughly rectify traffic and maintain passenger safety. It specially established a North Station Branch Bureau on Jiaotong Road, and selected excellent police officers to be responsible for the order of the North Station. Since the establishment of the bureau, it has strictly enforced its duties. In order to understand the current situation of the area, the reporter specially went to the North Station for inspection. (1) In terms of traffic, the chaotic situation of arbitrarily parked vehicles in front of the station in the past has gradually improved. (2) The entrance to the station originally stipulated that first and second class passengers should enter and exit through the main entrance. In the past, the personnel responsible for security arbitrarily allowed entry and exit without stopping them. Now, they guide passengers in accordance with the regulations to enter the station in an orderly manner. (3) The order inside the station is well maintained, and plainclothes police officers are often dispatched to investigate the actions of bad elements. Passengers line up to board the train in an orderly manner. (4) The situation at the ticket office, formerly known as the "black market," is more orderly than before. The authorities of the China Central Railway have also repeatedly reorganized the ticket office, and the attitude is no longer the same as before. Tickets are sold when available, and sales are stopped when the quota is exceeded. Therefore, passengers can purchase tickets easily and do not need to resort to the black market. (5) In the past, the stalls in front of the station were cluttered and noisy, and the situation was extremely chaotic. Now it has all been improved, which is convenient for merchants and travelers. It is heard that the China Railway authorities are determined to assist the Municipal Government in making further improvements to the order of the North Station.

### Key Points for Increasing Agricultural Production in Various Regions in the 34th Year (3)

(1) For the increased planting of rapeseed, cooperatives, trial morning reports, special agricultural reports, etc. should be used in the main rapeseed producing areas as demonstration and seed collection centers. On the one hand, nearby farmers can observe the actual situation, and on the other hand, high-quality seeds should be distributed to promote the utilization of seasonal fallow land, so as to achieve increased production of wheat and rapeseed. (2) In the main townships and towns where sweet potatoes grow, trial agricultural reports and special agricultural reports should be used as cultivation models, and mutual assistance and cooperative associations should be supervised and encouraged to improve their seedling cultivation and planting methods. At harvest time, yield competitions should be held to reward cultivation improvements. The planned subsidy for this work is 30,000 yuan per township this year. (3) In terms of agricultural implements: cooperatives, branches, sub-branches, mutual assistance societies, and other related organizations should be ordered to purchase threshing machines to improve the threshing method and save labor. On the one hand, farmers should be cultivated to develop a spirit of cooperation and habits, as the basis for cooperative production increase. For those who purchase this type of machine, a planned subsidy of 5,000 yuan per machine will be provided. In order to remedy the lack of packing materials, this year, active efforts should be made to produce handicraft products. For those who purchase handicraft manufacturing institutions, a subsidy of half of the purchase cost is planned, but the maximum subsidy is limited to 1,200 yuan per machine. (4) In terms of draught cattle, maintaining agricultural productivity and expanding draught cattle are of the utmost importance. Draught cattle are even more necessary when increasing production and engaging in deep plowing. Therefore, the protection and breeding of draught cattle are of great significance. This year, farmers who purchase draught cattle and breeders should make their best efforts to assist and protect them. (5) The improvement and breeding of breeding livestock should start with livestock. Therefore, the establishment of breeding livestock should be done with all efforts. This year, it is planned to provide a subsidy of 140,000 yuan per head for those who set up studs, and a subsidy of 60,000 yuan per head for those who set up breeding teams. In addition, livestock epidemic prevention is also a necessary facility for production increase. Last year, the serum manufacturing institute of the Ministry of Industry had not yet been established, and general serum and preventive liquids could not be purchased, so this professional project could not be held. Now the institute is preparing to open soon, and it is expected that this year, matters concerning livestock epidemic prevention will be started separately.

(C) Regarding the increase in production of industrial crops, the cotton test experiment and seed collection: This year will be completely handled by the Central Agricultural Test Institute, so as to concentrate efforts and make the institute the core of cotton technology improvement in the future. (1) Regarding the general increase in cotton production: such as production purchase and allocation control, since the cooperation and unification of various related agencies last year, the three provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui, and the two cities of Nanjing and Shanghai have achieved good results. Therefore, this year, the previous policy will continue to be carried out. (2) Hemp production: Hemp is necessary for general industry. This year, it is planned to add 20,000 mu of hemp cultivation outside the work area of the specified hemp promotion group, so that general farmers can be aware of engaging in hemp planting. (3) Castor: Last year, the increase in castor production exceeded expectations as a result of cooperation from all parties.

(D) This year's production increase plan will be announced together with the incentive and subsidy methods after consultation with all related parties. Regarding the training of agricultural technicians: (1) Agricultural instructors: Based on the experience of promoting production increase work last year, it is indispensable to have technical instructors who directly guide farmers' production in agricultural production increase work. Therefore, this year, it is planned to centrally train 100 agricultural instructors in the Central Agricultural Experiment Institute for application and implementation. (2) Agricultural technicians: Last year, the cooperative trained 200 agricultural technicians, but it was not enough for distribution. Therefore, this year, 100 outstanding and promising farmers who have been trained should be selected and given three months of re-training. As soon as the training is completed, they will be distributed to cooperatives in various places to serve and provide guidance to farmers in the area.

(E) Regarding the revitalization of rural side occupations: (1) Learning about rural side occupations: Last year, the production increase work mostly focused on the improvement of agricultural production technology. In terms of agricultural economy, it was not possible to handle it due to time and other reasons. However, if the agricultural economy cannot be revived, it will be difficult to improve agricultural technology, and thus agricultural production increase cannot be fully achieved. Therefore, this year, in addition to concentrating efforts on carrying out the improvement, guidance, and encouragement of agricultural technology in designated areas, special attention should be paid to agricultural and forestry economic issues that are closely related to rural side occupations and farmers' economy. Therefore, lectures on rural side occupations should be stepped up immediately. (2) Subsidies for rural side occupation factories: The importance of rural side occupations has been described in the previous article. Therefore, these workshops should be specially promoted. This year, it is planned to subsidize 20 places, with a planned subsidy of 30,000 yuan. (3) Planning and establishment of agricultural product processing plants: At this time when rural supplies are scarce and the agricultural economy is exhausted, the processing and manufacturing of agricultural products occupies an important position in the economy. Therefore, this year, these processing plants should be actively planned and established, and it is planned to establish eight plants as soon as possible, with a subsidy of 2 million yuan per plant.

### This City's Financial, Industrial, and Commercial Conditions Last Week: Drastic Fluctuations in Gold and Government Bonds

The financial, industrial, and commercial conditions in Shanghai have continued to evolve over the past week. However, the main reasons are still the rumors surrounding the European situation, the sudden surge in people buying gold, and the growing interest in government bonds. Therefore, apart from the volatile fluctuations in gold and government bonds, the conditions of other Chinese stocks and foodstuffs, while experiencing uneven ups and downs, have remained generally stable and constant throughout the financial, industrial, and commercial sectors. Once the speculative fervor subsides, the market is expected to return to stability. Therefore, the authorities are now closely investigating the illegal activities of speculative merchants and brokers, imposing strict measures to eliminate the evils of manipulation and disruption of the market. Looking back at the fiery red figures within the past week, the extent of the rise and fall was unprecedented. On one day, the largest increase reached about thirty points, with the peak reaching one hundred and forty-three points. At that time, buyers did not show any weakness. However, after the authorities discerned the underlying reasons and detained illegal market manipulators, the rise quickly subsided and drastically fell. However, the upward trend of various consolidated bonds remained strong. From Wednesday to Friday, only popular Chinese stocks experienced a sharp rise with brisk trading. On Saturday, due to the tightening restrictions on electricity, people felt fatigued, and the stock market turned from gains to losses, with a sluggish trend. The interbank call loan rate for money firms remained at the original rate of 6.5%, while the informal rate, due to the approaching Lunar New Year settlement, experienced urgent demand for funds, and the interbank lending rate continued to rise. The shortage of market chips has been slightly eased after the Central Bank of China issued new banknotes. As for various industrial and commercial sectors, the factory industry has not yet resolved the problem of electricity supply, making it difficult to restore production in the short term, and business is struggling to improve. Merchants in various industries have been unable to smoothly purchase goods, and it is difficult to suppress the rising prices in retail stores. In addition, due to the approaching Lunar New Year, residents are actively purchasing goods, holding up market prices. Among the daily necessities for the people, such as rice, grains, oil, sugar, and vegetables, prices have slightly increased, especially the price of rice, which has risen more sharply.

### Municipal Bureau of Public Works Holds Bureau Affairs Meeting

Since the Municipal Bureau of Public Works was ordered to merge with the Public Works Department of the former First District Public Office on August 1st last year, it has been actively reorganized, and various plans have been implemented step by step. However, because the former Public Works Department of the First District Public Office was formed by merging the Public Works Department of the former Shanghai Municipal Council and the Public Works Department of the former French Municipal Council, the personnel situation is relatively complex. It was originally scheduled to adjust the personnel during the first month of this year, but it was postponed due to circumstances. It is now learned that Director Zhang Enlin, in order to actively promote various tasks, convened a bureau affairs meeting in the bureau's secretarial office on the (3rd) day prior. All personnel above the level of director of the bureau attended. First, Chief Secretary Zhang Hongzhong clarified the purpose of the meeting, instructing each department to immediately fill in and report in detail on the various work plans that should be established and abolished, so as to plan in a unified manner and enable the work to proceed simply and quickly.

### Tonight's Basketball League: Zhongbei vs. Jiashen; Zhongbei Hualian Changed to Friendly Match Yesterday

In the basketball league, the Class A first-round final between Hualian and Zhongbei, originally scheduled to be held last night, was changed to a friendly exhibition match because the audience in the Army Dormitory stadium was too crowded, and the court was occupied, reducing the court to a size that was not suitable for competition.

Since Mayor Zhou and Secretary-General Luo took office, municipal administration in this city has shown a new and promising outlook. Citizens unanimously expect the rejuvenation of municipal administration, and the authorities have repeatedly declared their determination. The goals of officials and the public are completely the same. However, how to further enable officials and the public to work together and achieve the goal as soon as possible is crucial. This newspaper is willing to contribute a little effort in this regard. We have specially established a column called "Shanghai Municipal Administration" to publish the authorities' intentions regarding municipal measures, the public's demands, the public's suggestions for municipal measures, and the demands on the authorities, in order to communicate opinions, promote mutual understanding, and then work together. Starting this week, it will be published every Saturday. We respectfully hope that the relevant authorities of municipal organs and the public will contribute articles to this publication based on what they have seen, heard, and want to say. Currently, the issue of dispersing the population is extremely important. We hope that readers will study and contribute articles on how to plan and how to promote this issue. Once published, we will send a small remuneration.
