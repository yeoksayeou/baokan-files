On the morning of the 19th, the enemy again began attacking with several thousand tanks and approximately ten thousand infantry troops. From dawn, the sound of gunfire from both sides continued without interruption, engaging in a fierce and intense battle. The Japanese army continued to ensure the first line of defense, inflicting heavy damage on the enemy that evening, repelling them before the lines. Dozens of enemy tanks were left sitting inside the defensive positions, and the human losses were also extremely numerous. Meanwhile, approximately one thousand enemy troops who landed on Ie Island have been engaged by the Japanese army in fierce fighting. As of now, the enemy forces landed around Okinawa Island have reached approximately six divisions. The officers and soldiers of the Japanese army's first line have very high morale and are currently fighting valiantly. In addition, at sea, especially towards Minatogawa and the Itokazu area two kilometers northeast of it, the naval bombardment became even more intense on the 19th.

### Japanese Army Minister Anami Issues "Decisive Battle Instruction"

Tokyo, 20th (Central News Agency Telegram) - The Japanese Army authorities, with the war pressing close to Okinawa, a part of the Japanese mainland, specially formulated a "Decisive Battle Instruction," which was recently issued to the entire army by Army Minister Anami, explaining the path forward for Japanese soldiers. The main points are as follows:

Japanese soldiers should uphold the Emperor's command, consistently adhere to the belief that the Divine Land will never perish, faithfully carry out their duties, and the foundation of victory lies in this.

Japanese soldiers should defend the national territory to the death, for the national territory is the location of the Emperor's residence and the sacred site where deities are enshrined. They must repel foreign invaders, and even if their bodies die, their spirits will remain to protect it.

Japanese soldiers should be fully prepared, and through training focused on certain victory and certain death, build impregnable fortresses.

Japanese soldiers should uphold the spirit of suicidal attacks, which is the tradition of Japanese warriors. With this, they will kill and exterminate all who invade the national territory, leaving none alive to return.

Japanese soldiers should be the vanguard of one hundred million comrades. One hundred million compatriots are all comrades protecting Japan. Under strict military discipline, they should develop comradeship, display the true character of the Japanese army, and take the lead in completing the great national task.

### Special Attack Forces Launch Large-Scale Raids, Heavily Damaging Enemy Ships off Okinawa: War Situation Enters a Stage Favorable to Japan

Tokyo, 20th (Central News Agency Telegram) - In the air battles around Okinawa Island, since the 16th, the enemy has increasingly shown signs of confusion. The war situation has entered the final stage favorable to Japan. Repeatedly, Japanese special attack forces have launched fierce attacks, inflicting severe blows on the enemy mobile units east of Okinawa and the enemy ship groups around Okinawa Island. In particular, the enemy's aircraft carrier losses have been even more severe, with thirteen sunk, two sunk or destroyed, and six destroyed, totaling twenty-one. Other battleships, cruisers, etc., sunk or destroyed have reached three hundred and seventy-two, among which several are likely to be aircraft carrier types. Calculating in this way, the losses of aircraft carriers are close to thirty. Local propaganda loudly announced the deployment of one thousand four hundred ships, but so far half have been lost, and the local panic can be imagined. Since March 23rd, based on confirmed war results, four hundred ships have been sunk. Calculating at two thousand men per ship, the enemy personnel losses are around eight hundred thousand. The enemy may be able to deploy some more ships in the future, but the replenishment of manpower will certainly not be so simple. Therefore, for the enemy, the most difficult thing to cope with is the great bloodshed.

Army Aviation Base, 20th (Central News Agency Telegram) - At the turning point of the decisive battle on Okinawa Island, Japanese special attack forces continue to launch large-scale raids, inflicting severe bloodshed and damage on enemy ships. However, the enemy is still stubbornly clinging to the island's surrounding waters, gathering a large fleet of more than two hundred main battleships, still attempting a desperate attack. It has been more than twenty days since the landing on Okinawa Island on April 1st. The enemy's landing force here is said to be the Navy's 11th and 6th Divisions and the 24th Army's 7th, 27th, 77th, and 96th Divisions, a total of six divisions, numbering approximately one hundred thousand. The enemy has occupied both the northern and central airfields and has already begun using them. The Japanese ground defense forces have launched daring counterattacks against them daily, inflicting great damage on the enemy. According to the announcement of the General Headquarters, the enemy's personnel losses have reached approximately one thousand. At the same time, Japanese special attack forces have also launched raids daily, and the number of enemy ships sunk to the bottom of the sea has reached four hundred, which is rare in the history of war. However, the enemy's ambition has not been abandoned, and they still strongly desire to launch repeated fierce attacks. In the end, the two sides will fight, and the one that remains will win. Although the enemy's material supplies are maintained with difficulty, their ships are ultimately limited. However, the spirit of the Japanese special attack forces is unlimited. At present, the Japanese special attack forces are by no means few. The entire aviation unit has become special attack members, resolved to fight to the last soldier, hoping to achieve final victory.

### New-Type Meteor Bomb: Aircraft Used by Japanese Kamikaze Corps Have Excellent Performance and Tremendous Destructive Power

Central News Agency Report - According to a United Press report from Kunming on the 17th, the large-scale production of new-type aircraft used by the Japanese Kamikaze corps is as follows: Japan is now manufacturing a large number of special suicidal aircraft in factories in Manchuria and training suicide pilots in preparation for using them as secret retaliatory weapons in the future. Therefore, this weapon, which will appear in East Asia in the future, has greater destructive power than the V1 and V2 meteor bombs used by the German army in Europe. According to reliable sources, the special suicidal aircraft currently being manufactured on a large scale in Manchuria can carry one ton (i.e., two thousand two hundred pounds) of bombs. This type of bomb is installed in front of the driver's seat, and explodes immediately when the nose or wing tip hits a solid object. The performance of this type of aircraft is extremely excellent. Its speed in level flight is four hundred miles per hour, and its speed can increase to six hundred miles per hour during a headlong dive. The pilots are mostly young people aged eighteen to twenty-five. They do not carry parachutes. When taking off from the ground, they abandon the wheels, hoping never to return. Because they do not consider the return route, their sortie distance is quite long. This type of aircraft can launch a new type of popular single cloud cloud.

Editorial

### Expectations of the People's Congress

The People's Congress of the United National Salvation Movement, following the Wartime People's Representative Congresses of various provinces and cities, will be held simultaneously in various provinces and cities across the country today. At this time when the situation is extremely serious, the holding of people's congresses in various localities is of great significance. We, considering the overall situation, cannot refrain from speaking on several points, and we respectfully offer them to the representatives of the people's congresses of various provinces and cities.

The holding of the People's Congress aims to concentrate the power of the people to assist the government's established national policies, overcome difficulties together, reverse the critical situation, and achieve the goal of uniting the country and saving the nation. Therefore, its only highest goal is to adapt to the current situation's requirements and solve all practical problems.

The biggest problem facing our country at present is how to fulfill the Sino-Japanese alliance treaty and assume the obligation of participating in the war. To solve this practical problem, it is by no means a sincere declaration and colorful slogans; it is by no means a paper of empty resolutions. The most urgent thing is to discuss how to realize the national material mobilization, because at present, only the thorough material mobilization can generate the power to cooperate in the war, can be said to assume the responsibility of participating in the war, and can solve the biggest external problem.

Among domestic problems, the most serious is still the problem of people's livelihood, which is also the problem of production. Due to the widespread stagnation and even suspension of production in various parts of the peace zone centered on Shanghai, it has evolved into a serious price problem, and further evolved into social and even political problems in which the vast majority of people cannot make a living. All phenomena that violate wartime national policies, such as corruption and malfeasance in some political circles, hoarding and speculation among the people, and all selfish and profiteering behaviors in society, are becoming more and more intense and serious as a result. Therefore, the People's Congress must have specific opinions on how to restore production and increase production, and discuss practical and effective methods, so that it can be realized in the short term with the consistent cooperation of the Sino-Japanese military, political, and civilian sectors.

At present or in the future, if materials cannot be quickly and thoroughly mobilized, it is not enough to say that the responsibility of participating in the war is assumed; if production cannot be quickly restored and increased, it is not enough to say that the problem of people's livelihood is solved. If the responsibility of participating in the war cannot be assumed, and the problem of people's livelihood cannot be solved, then all our people's movements and political movements will lose their basis. Any declaration and resolution cannot solve the current practical problems at home and abroad. Therefore, what we expect from the People's Congresses held separately in various provinces and cities today is only the above two points.

The People's Congress of the United National Salvation Movement, as the name implies, in addition to solving the current practical problems at home and abroad, seems to have a more far-reaching goal, to promote the national united salvation movement through the activities of the People's Congresses in various provinces and cities in the peace zone; but we must recognize the complexity of China's international relations and domestic politics today. To be in a superior position in these two aspects and form a leader in the national united salvation, it first depends on whether there is a practical solution to internal and external practical problems? If the current practical problems cannot be solved, that is, the task of participating in the war cannot be fulfilled externally, and the promotion of production to relieve the suffering of people's livelihood cannot be achieved internally, that is, the unanimous belief of the people cannot be obtained, then meetings that are merely formalities cannot achieve practical results. This is also what we sincerely advise the People's Congress and the government authorities. The times are dangerous and the situation is urgent. We sincerely hope that the government and the public will encourage each other in a timely manner!

### Governor Hao Pengju Talks about the Administrative Policy of the Huaihai Provincial Government: Huaihai Travel Notes 4

— Yifei

Governor Hao Pengju continued: Since I took over Huaihai's administration, its administrative policy has roughly included the following points. However, to achieve what is desired, it is not only necessary to look at the efforts of the political personnel, but also to rely on the cooperation of the people of the province. Now, I will speak separately:

Training the people: This layer has already achieved considerable results. Taking Xiao County as an example, more than 160,000 people have been trained. Other counties are also promoting it. In this way, the situation below can be communicated to the top, and the situation above can be announced to the bottom, so that the effect of official-civilian cooperation can be achieved.

Revitalizing the rural economy: To make people's lives stable, it is necessary to vigorously promote cooperative undertakings. Currently, the capital of the Huaihai Cooperative is 600 million, which has achieved considerable results in revitalizing the rural economy.

Popularizing education: According to Huaihai's past environmental relations, it has created a low cultural level. During the Qing Dynasty, there were insulting comments on the people of Huaihai, but the giant wheel of the times has turned Huaihai to the bright side. In recent years, the provincial government has the greatest determination for the work of popularizing people's education and has spared no effort in carrying it out, hoping to make the people interested in politics so that they can exert and realize the spirit of democracy. As for the work of educating children, it has been quite effective in recent years. At present, the enrollment of school-age children has increased by more than 20% compared with before. In addition, the teachers' treatment, except for their remuneration, is the same as that of civil servants. For the sake of preferential treatment, each person is allocated 70 to 140 kilograms of wheat per month so that they can concentrate on serving. Unfortunately, due to the lack of funds and building materials, although the number of students has increased in recent years, the school buildings cannot be expanded. The system of entering school in the morning and afternoon has been implemented, which is only a temporary transitional measure. In addition, Huaihai's highest institution of learning is the "Huaihai College," which is the place to train economic and administrative professionals. As for the Yunlong College, which is being planned, it is the future Huaihai University.

Opening up transportation and rectifying the customs: In the past, Huaihai's transportation was quite backward, so the customs were also very simple and unsophisticated, which cannot be denied. Now, the provincial government, on the one hand, has made a comprehensive plan for transportation construction and has put it into practice one by one. For example, the expansion of the roads in Xuzhou, the provincial capital, Lianyungang. Nanjing-Pukou. The main lines of Huaiyin and other places have also been completed to make a strong contribution to provincial defense. People's livelihood. The exchange of foreign materials, etc., can make a strong contribution. As for guiding the customs, the provincial government, in addition to vigorously encouraging the preservation of the inherent simplicity, hard work, and other good points, also implements the prohibition of opium and gambling. And officials and soldiers must strictly implement the "Huaihai Provincial Military and Political Personnel's Reform of Life Covenant" that I personally set. If there is any intentional violation, they will be dealt with according to military law. Without talking about the past, recently, a special agent chief in Xiao County violated the oath and has been executed. The battalion vice-commander of his superiors was also guilty of improper management and was detained for punishment. In the future, we will continue to follow the original purpose and select officials and officers according to their talents and will never be influenced by personal feelings. After the selection, they will also be made to understand the times and to assume the responsibility of protecting the country and the people.

In terms of cooperation in the war, the province has successively built hospitals, barracks, repair shops, clothing factories, leather factories, etc., most of which are in a certain place. The rest are scattered everywhere. As for military education institutions, there are military cadre training groups, anti-communist training groups, and training classes for various departments such as management personnel, machine guns, and ordnance, to create technically excellent military personnel who will never disturb the people.

### Halsey's Selection Reveals American Ambition

Lisbon, 20th (Central News Agency Telegram) - According to a New York dispatch on the 19th, Halsey, commander of the U.S. Pacific Third Fleet, wrote in the recently published Collier's magazine that the United States will absolutely not allow Japan to propose a formal peace treaty. The peace treaty instead puts Japan in a "truce state" for a long time. All Japanese who are war criminals should be severely punished, regardless of their status and without any consideration. To retaliate for the American soldiers killed by the Japanese army in the Pacific, the only way we can deal with the Japanese army is by execution. It is not only me who hates the Japanese. All the officers and soldiers under my command have the same feeling. The United States should incapacitate the Japanese nation and must make it unable to do so for a long time. Therefore, the following measures must be taken: Without the recognition of the anti-Axis countries, Japan cannot use a single ship. Deprive all Japanese of their weapons. Deprive Japan of all war attack materials.

During the discussion of the budget bill, almost all members of the House of Representatives demanded that the United States occupy various Pacific islands after the war. A Republican member elected from New York stated: "Iwo Jima, Saipan, the Mariana Islands, the Caroline Islands, and other islands were occupied by the American army at the cost of a large amount of blood and sweat, so the United States should have the right to hold these islands." A Democratic member elected from Montana stated: "In order to safeguard the security of the United States in the Pacific, it is also permissible for the United States to incorporate the islands under Japanese mandate into the territory of the United States." It is expected that the Budget Committee may formally propose a plan to occupy Pacific islands due to the proposal of the House members.

### Enemy U.S. Warships Suffer Heavy Losses

Tokyo, 20th (Central News Agency telegram) - Enemy powerful mobile units appeared in the southwest islands on March 23 and began landing on the Kerama Islands. Since the enemy invaded Okinawa, a month has passed in an instant, and the decisive battle has not yet reached its climax. A large-scale war of attrition, the likes of which have never been seen before on land, sea, and air, will unfold in that area. The losses suffered by the enemy during this period, based solely on confirmed sinkings, have reached 400 enemy warships. However, the enemy's attempts do not seem to have been thwarted. They continue to reinforce the landing forces and strengthen the supply ships. The enemy, both the United States and America, are blindly bombing the Japanese side with a large number of carrier-based aircraft, and their determination to seize Okinawa is very strong. The future course of the war is still not to be taken lightly. Although the enemy has boastfully mobilized more than 1,400 ships for this operation and exaggerated the pouring in of huge amounts of materials, the fact is that the sinking and destruction of ships has had a considerable impact on the operation, especially the large loss of aircraft carriers, battleships, cruisers, and destroyers, which has greatly hindered the enemy's invasion. After all, in naval invasion operations, the mission of warships is extremely important, whether it is to protect the landing forces during the start of the landing operation or to protect transport convoys. Without warships, basic operations are impossible.

### The Anguish of America

— Tadahisa Matsudaira

It has been more than eight years since I left America, and my knowledge of various aspects of the United States is quite outdated. However, during my stay in the United States, I shook hands with the late Roosevelt, attended banquets hosted by Ambassador Saito, and spoke with various cabinet members such as Wallace, Morganthau, Ickes, and Ms. Perkins, and often attended their meetings in the Washington Congress. I also went to the State Department for relatively unimportant negotiations and spoke with the head of the Far East Bureau or the head of the Japanese section from a public standpoint. Therefore, compared to people who have never been to the United States, I have a considerable interest in and attention to the United States. Now, I will use the knowledge I gained in the past to talk about the most distressing issue facing America during wartime.

I myself admit that America is a great tree of democracy. They also boast and praise themselves for respecting public opinion, respecting human rights, and being a country of the common people. The fact is indeed so. Looking at American history, they left Europe due to religious oppression and economic insecurity and migrated to the American continent. Because they could not bear the tyrannical rule of the British mainland and were stimulated by the French Revolution, they launched a war of independence, eliminated all monarchical institutions, and built a country of the common people. Therefore, their political organization is one of mutual restraint, in order to prevent autocracy. Thus, American politics boasts the separation of powers.

The Chief Justice of the Supreme Court Has a Lofty Position

When I went to America, I saw that the position of the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court was very high, second only to the President, and surpassing the position of the Chief Justice of the Japanese Supreme Court by tens of millions. At that time, the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court was Hughes, who was qualified as Secretary of State and had high experience and prestige. I once asked law students, "What do you hope to do after you graduate?" Many students replied interestingly, "I want to be the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court." Indeed, the American judicial power is strictly independent, always maintaining consistent legal dignity, planning for the people, and preventing autocracy everywhere. But I think this may be the main factor hindering the United States from carrying out the war. Recently, a famous department store in Chicago had a labor dispute. Because they did not obey the government's orders, the government took over the company's factory. The owner then sued the court, demanding that the government return the factory. The court ruled that the government's measures were improper, causing the government to lose the lawsuit. Such litigation is probably rare in the United States, but the government has expressed dissatisfaction and filed an appeal, requesting repeated retrials. The case has not yet been resolved. It can also be seen here that a certain degree of dictatorial political organization is necessary during wartime, but the arrogance of the judicial organ hinders government action, which has become a real problem for the United States.

Congress Monitors the President's Actions

Secondly, the legislative power, which holds great power, is the so-called Congress. Congress is the power that restrains the government—that is, the President—and closely monitors the President's actions. Among them, the Senate has even greater power. Even important issues such as declaring war or making peace are invalid without the support of two-thirds of the Senate. When President Wilson organized the League of Nations and returned home, he did not receive two-thirds of the support, so he could not join the League.

Furthermore, Congress also has the right to freely amend wartime legislation proposed by the government. For example, in the recent National Conscription Act, the government originally stipulated citizens over the age of 18, but Congress amended it to citizens over the age of 19. At that time, members of Congress received many letters of opposition from farmers in the electoral districts, which were either publicly disclosed in Congress or published in newspapers and magazines, attacking the government's plans and forcing the government to change its plans. In addition, Congress also has the right to reject important policies implemented by the President, and important personnel must also be understood by the Congress. Therefore, the government is most difficult to deal with Congress, especially if the President is a mediocre person, then Congress will monitor more closely, and all wartime measures will be very difficult to implement.

### Finance Bureau Plans to Adjust Property and Land Taxes to Increase City Treasury Revenue: Director Luo Jian Attends Routine Press Conference and Speaks

The 13th routine press conference hosted by the City Propaganda Office was held at 10:00 AM yesterday (20th) in the City Government conference room. Those present included City Finance Bureau Director Luo Jian, Chief Secretary Xu Songping, City Propaganda Office Director Liu Dexuan, and more than a dozen reporters from various newspapers. Director Luo answered the questions raised by the reporters regarding the Finance Bureau's established budget, balanced revenue and expenditure, consumption, business, and license taxes, as well as the allocation of tax revenue, in detail. The following is a summary:

Various Taxes

(Question) What are the results of the Finance Bureau's efforts to adjust various taxes? (Answer) For various taxes, in addition to adjusting the license fee rates, increasing the special retail consumption tax on goods from 4% to 5%, raising the assessed value of various business taxes, and launching the business tax in the old one-eight districts, all other taxes are collected according to the old regulations. However, we are making every effort to pay attention to tax evasion by taxpayers and embezzlement of tax revenue by collection agents, as well as corruption by illegal collection personnel. Since March, tax revenue has increased significantly.

(Question) How many cases of businesses found to have evaded taxes have been punished, and what is the total number up to the middle of this month? Is all the fines deposited in the city treasury or are they used for other purposes? (Answer) The total amount of fines imposed on merchants for embezzling special consumption tax from November 16, 1944 to April 15, 1945, was more than 31,017,000 yuan, of which 11,700,000 yuan has been paid. As for the entertainment venues that violated regulations and evaded taxes, there were a total of 49 cases up to the middle of this month, and the fines imposed amounted to more than 16,859,000 yuan, of which more than 3 million yuan has not been paid. According to regulations, this fine is first deposited in the city treasury, but a portion may be used to reward informants and those who have contributed to the case.

(Question) What is the recent situation of the special consumption tax collection? What is the reason for the recent revision of the tax rates for retail goods and restaurant banquets special consumption tax? (Answer) The collection of the special consumption tax has been improving every month. In March, including the amount to be transferred to the Ministry, a total of 950 million yuan was collected. The reason for the revision of the tax rates this time is that the tax rates on luxury goods were too heavy, and legitimate transactions decreased. In addition, the progressive tax rates adopted by restaurants and hotels were too high and easily led to merchants taking advantage of loopholes to evade taxes or embezzle them. We have submitted a request to the central government for correction.

(Question) The deadline for reporting and paying the business tax is the end of this month. How much tax has been received so far? What is the total budgeted amount for the collection of this tax? What is the total amount that has been declared and calculated so far? (Answer) Since the launch of the spring business tax in the former one-eight districts, merchants have been enthusiastically applying for and paying taxes. Currently, more than 360 million yuan has been collected, and it is expected that 900 million yuan can be collected each quarter.

(Question) How is the performance of the special consumption tax collection offices for fresh meat set up by your bureau in the urban area? It is said that the office collects donations from the suburbs on a daily basis based on the land. Are the numbers of fresh pigs actually sold and reported accurately? (Answer) After the collection of the special consumption tax on pork was delegated to the same industry association, a total of more than 89 million yuan in tax revenue was paid in January and February. Both the urban and suburban areas collect and remit as much as possible based on the number of pigs.

(Question) What about the experience and ability of the newly trained tax personnel who have graduated from the crash course? Are you satisfied with their work performance? (Answer) The newly trained tax investigators have relatively shallow experience and ability due to the short training period. However, after being assigned to work, most of them are able to work hard and their performance is still good.

(Question) In recent months, various restaurants, theaters, etc., have been fined tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands, or millions for embezzling special taxes. In terms of severely punishing unscrupulous merchants' psychology of tax evasion, it is indeed well deserved, but the numbers are quite large. What is your bureau's opinion? (Answer) The cases in which our bureau punishes merchants for violating regulations and embezzling tax revenue are all handled in accordance with the established rules. The multiples of all punishments are calculated lightly and according to the lowest multiples. However, because the amount of tax embezzled by the merchants is very large, according to the special consumption tax regulations, they must be fined ten to twenty times the amount of tax evaded. Therefore, the amount of the fine is very large. Our bureau has no right to reduce it, but in order to take into account the merchants' situation, we will consider allowing them to pay in installments. We hope that all merchants will be able to pay taxes in accordance with the regulations in the future to avoid being punished.

(Question) Your bureau sent personnel to collect special retail taxes from street vendors at the North Railway Station, but the attitude of the inspectors is not good. They do not explain the rules at first, and they often throw away chickens, fish, rice, noodles, etc. at will. This point should be corrected. If an office can be set up at the North Station, it would be easier to centralize management. (Answer) Our bureau has not sent personnel to collect special retail taxes from street vendors at the North Station. We have never considered this matter and will investigate it to find out the truth.

(Question) How is the performance of the finance bureaus of various counties in collecting the special retail and restaurant banquet consumption taxes since this month? (Answer) The special consumption tax of various counties has only recently been taken over by the county finance bureaus. The time is very short and no reports have been submitted to the bureau yet.

(Question) I recently learned that your bureau has announced the Ministry of Finance's amendment to the special consumption tax rate for banquets, changing the original 15% to 40% to 20%, and also levying 10% on meals for the poor. Ordinary people who eat a meal or snack at a street stall every day also have to bear such a heavy tax, which seems unbearable. May I ask if your bureau can cite past precedents and exempt ordinary meals from tax in order to reduce the burden on citizens? (Answer) Our bureau collects the special consumption tax in accordance with the regulations of the Ministry. Before we receive an order to allow tax exemption, we have no right to change the established rules.

(Question) In the past, when newly established merchants applied to your bureau for various business licenses, the date of application and the date of issuance were delayed by two or three months. During this period, your bureau has a regulation that does not allow applicants to operate in advance. Therefore, merchants cannot operate during this period, and the losses suffered are quite large. I wonder if your bureau can have a flexible solution in order to alleviate the difficulties of merchants? (Answer) Newly established merchants should first prepare a deposit and apply to our bureau for a business license. At the same time, our bureau will send a copy of the application to the relevant bureaus for review. If it is deemed to be in compliance with the regulations, our bureau will be notified to issue the license. Otherwise, the applicant must correct the procedures. Our bureau will never deliberately delay the issuance of licenses.

Current Situation of Land Tax

(Question) What is the performance of the land tax and other tax revenues in the counties under your jurisdiction since you took office? There were past cases of excessive collection. Has this been completely eliminated? (Answer) Our city's counties are currently preparing to collect land tax in kind. The amount of land tax arrears from previous years is still large. However, we have formulated measures to clear up the land tax arrears in various counties and dispatched personnel to the counties to clear up and urge payment. There were indeed cases of excessive collection in the past, but after investigation and strict handling, no similar cases have been discovered. We hope that all sectors of society will assist our bureau in reporting them at any time.

(Question) It is said that the police rice of various counties has been transferred to the direct collection of each county. How much is each county? Is the collection amount the same? Is the collected police rice converted into cash? What is the standard for the price? Is it clearly announced to prevent abuses? (Answer) The city government stipulates that the police rice of various counties should be temporarily borrowed by the counties from the townships according to the number of police officers and the amount of rice allocated. After the land tax in kind is collected this year, it will be planned and handled as a whole, and the borrowed rice will be returned to the people.

(Question) What is the performance of the land tax, treasure, and military police rice collected in various counties in 1944? (Answer) The tax revenue collected in various counties in 1944 was converted from kind into cash. The approved price of rough japonica rice was 1,800 yuan per stone, and it was collected according to the grade. (For example, if the land of a first-class household pays one dou of rice per mu, it will pay 180 yuan. The military rice fee is collected together with the land tax at 150 yuan per mu.) It was collected successively from October. Except for Fengxian and Shenjiang counties, whose performance was the last, the collection amount reached 90%. The remaining counties were between 50% and 70%, while Nanhui was less than 30%.

City Treasury Revenue and Expenditure

(Question) What are your opinions on establishing a budget and balancing revenue and expenditure? What new plans do you have for increasing the city treasury in the future? (Answer) The government establishes a budget in order to ensure that government revenue and expenditure are appropriate and to show that revenue and expenditure have a standard. However, balancing revenue and expenditure is a prerequisite for establishing a budget. Currently, the most urgent and unavoidable expenditures in our city are military and police expenses and highway construction expenses. Other expenses, such as the adjustment of civil servants' salaries and the increase in office expenses of various agencies due to rising prices, cannot be reduced. On the revenue side, production is stagnant, citizens' purchasing power is reduced, and the special consumption tax and business tax may decrease at any time. When budgeting, revenue and expenditure can still be balanced, and the budget can barely be established. However, the current economic situation is volatile, and there is a phenomenon that the budget may be broken and revenue and expenditure may be unbalanced at any time. The financial authorities must not only deal with the difficulties of the moment, but also have a long-term vision to adapt to the future environment. My plan for increasing the city treasury in the future is still focused on increasing revenue, and I plan to appropriately adjust the property and land tax. We are now actively planning and proceeding.

(Question) After the city government and its subordinate bureaus and offices implemented staff reduction and salary increase, how much has the salary expenditure increased compared to before? What is the total amount required per month? (Answer) After the city government and various bureaus and offices implemented staff reduction and salary increase, the monthly salary expenditure has increased significantly. Before the increase in salaries, the total amount of monthly salaries was more than 179 million yuan. After the salary increase, the total amount of monthly salaries was more than 599 million yuan, an increase of more than 419 million yuan per month.

(In addition, I asked) How is the public's subscription to the temporary relief bonds? What is the total amount sold so far? (Answer) Of the temporary relief bonds, 500 million yuan is collected by the Fuxing Bank, which has not yet been deposited in the treasury, and it is expected that all of them can be sold out.

### Yesterday's News from the County Administration: Police Affairs Discussion Meeting, Attendance and Reports from County Police Chiefs

The City County Administration, in order to understand the police situation in its subordinate counties and strive to strengthen police affairs, specially convened the police chiefs of its subordinate counties at the City Hall conference room at 10:00 AM yesterday (the 20th) to hold a police affairs discussion meeting.

First, Secretary-General Luo personally came to give instructions, giving detailed guidance on various points for reforming police affairs in each county. The gist of his instructions was roughly as follows: "To establish the scale of municipal and county administration in this city, the reform of police affairs should be the starting point. The various past undesirable phenomena of the police, such as colluding with bandits, preying on the people, and planting factions for personal gain, must be earnestly investigated and eliminated at all times, without being perfunctory, without making excuses, and without yielding to the environment, to effectively relieve the people's suffering and ensure their peace." Afterwards, Deputy Director Yi presided over the meeting (Director Cai was on sick leave and replaced by Deputy Director Tan), reporting the significance of the meeting.

### Municipal District Deed Tax Changed to be Handled by the Finance Bureau

Regarding the deed tax on the mortgage and sale of real estate, the central government has stipulated deed tax regulations that are uniformly followed nationwide. However, in the urban area of ​​this city, due to environmental factors, the Land Administration Bureau formulated the "Provisional Rules for the Levying of Real Estate Transfer Deed Tax in Shanghai" and handled it separately, which was originally a temporary measure of expediency. It is now known that the municipal government, in order to unify administration, has abolished the above-mentioned provisional rules for the transfer deed tax on real estate. All matters related to the deed tax on the mortgage and sale of real estate will be uniformly handled by the Finance Bureau in accordance with the tax regulations issued by the ministry. The two bureaus of finance and land have been ordered to hand over the matters separately and implement them immediately.

Exemption from Business Tax for Silk Factories

The Municipal Government of this city believes that silk factories have already paid a special tax on silkworms. This special tax is a central tax and is based on the price of silk as the completion standard. Its nature already includes business tax. Therefore, the Finance Bureau has been ordered to follow Article 18 of the Provisional Regulations for the Collection of Business Tax: "Where a factory or company and its affiliated offices have already paid a unified tax levied by the central government, they shall not be levied business tax again." Exemption from business tax is approved. However, the business of silk shops, which falls within the scope of promotion and sales, shall still pay business tax as required.

### Air Defense Headquarters Organizes Special Rescue Team

### Municipal Government Strictly Prohibits Military Personnel from Causing Trouble

During the performance of Choi Seung-hee's dance at the Dahua Theater in this city on August 8, suddenly twenty or thirty people in Chinese naval uniforms, without purchasing tickets, tried to force their way into the theater, causing a conflict with the theater staff and smashing the windows. The theater filed a report with the municipal government requesting protection. In addition to sending a letter to the Navy Department to strictly order an investigation and prohibition, the municipal government also informed the police bureau that if similar incidents occur in the future, no matter who they are, they should immediately investigate the facts and detain the troublemakers for handling.

### Impersonating Military Police, Thugs Arrested

Recently, there have been unscrupulous thugs in this city impersonating military police personnel, making rumors and swindling, intimidating and defrauding, and committing all kinds of evils. The military and police authorities have repeatedly issued orders for investigation and suppression. It is now known that a thug named Huang Shanren, alias Yongchuan, using the pseudonym "Xianguang", falsely claimed to be a secret agent of the Japanese Military Police and made rumors and swindled on a large scale. He went to restaurants such as Wanshoushan Dingxiang and cafes such as Queen's Fine Arts, as well as hotels such as Andong Da Xin Da Dong, and used the name of the Military Police to beat and use people, eat and stay without paying, and solicit prostitutes without paying. He defrauded tens of thousands of yuan from pawnshops such as Zhenkang Guangchang. The Police Bureau learned of the situation and arrested Huang in Room 214 of the Da Dong Hotel. Under strict interrogation, he confessed to more than a dozen cases. He has now been identified by the Lao Zha Branch and transferred to the District Prosecutor's Office for handling. It is hoped that citizens will pay attention and report to the relevant branch if there are any thugs impersonating military police and defrauding them.

### Application Procedures for Municipal Public Cemetery Plots

The Health Bureau is now informing citizens that many citizens in this city have applied to the bureau to purchase plots in the municipal public cemetery. In order to make the application procedures clear to the citizens, the procedures are listed below:

For citizens who have died within six months, their direct relatives may submit a letter along with a death certificate, Baojia death report, etc., in person to the Public Cemetery Section of the bureau (Room 17, City Hall Building, Hankou Road). After the section dispatches personnel to investigate and confirm, approval can be granted. After purchasing the plot, the burial must be completed within one month. If the deadline is exceeded, the bureau may confiscate the plot. The certified physician or medical practitioner must have a certificate from the Ministry of Health and a business license from the bureau to be valid. The bureau will not accept applications for plots entrusted to funeral homes, etc.

### To Stop Rising Prices, Three Steps, Director Chen Calls Director Xu to Discuss Countermeasures

Due to the unreasonable surge in the black market for gold, other related financial stocks have also risen accordingly. Those who own wealth are all active in the speculative financial market. Now that the Chang Bureau has strictly suppressed speculative manipulation, the market traders and wealth owners have turned to material activities. Therefore, the general prices in this city have recently shown signs of restlessness. At this time, in the midst of the evacuation of the population in this city, citizens from other places are enthusiastically flocking to Shanghai. Since the population has decreased, the consumption of materials is lower than before, and prices will inevitably tend to fall due to the reduction in sales. The recent trend of rising prices is caused by the manipulation of general speculators and hoarders. Minister Chen of the Ministry of Industry is paying close attention to the problem of rising prices. In order to prevent unscrupulous market traders from hoarding and manipulating, he recently summoned Director Xu of the Municipal Economic Bureau to discuss countermeasures for a long time. Minister Chen's instructions to stop rising prices were very detailed. According to the reporter's investigation, the contents of the countermeasures to suppress prices are roughly divided into three steps: implement price limits, strictly investigate hoarding, and implement registration. The Chang Bureau has issued orders to the competent authorities to comply with the instructions. According to the reporter's inquiry to the relevant economic authorities, all relevant authorities in this city have been in close contact and investigative preparation to prevent the trend of rising prices again. If illegal transactions exceeding the price limit or the purchase and hoarding of materials outside the industry are discovered, they will be punished by more severe means.

However, the remittances to North China have decreased sharply.

### Air Defense Headquarters Releases Points to Note for Citizens During Air Raids

At 4:10 AM on the 15th of this month, an enemy plane invaded the airspace of this city, attempting to bomb the northern district of Shanghai. Fortunately, the bombs dropped fell on the road, only causing slight damage to a nearby house and some windows. The details have been released. The Civil Air Defense Headquarters of this city has released the following points based on the experience gained from the enemy plane's attack that day for future air defense work and hopes that citizens will pay attention to them.

Open Windows During Air Raids

The air vibration caused by the explosion of a bomb shattered the window glass within about 100 yards of the drop point. It can be seen that windows should be opened during air raids. If there is an external covering, the covering should be pulled open.

Arrange Furniture Every Night Before Bed

Building appropriate air raid shelters is undoubtedly important, but based on the experience gained from the enemy plane's attack that day, we deeply feel that residents should use any sturdy furniture in their homes as much as possible for shelter during air raids. Blankets and bedding can also be used as coverings to avoid flying glass fragments. Because it is impossible to predict when the enemy will attack, residents of this city must use all appropriate furniture in their homes to arrange them properly for protection during air raids every night before bed. If they encounter an air raid and do not have time to quickly go to the air raid shelter for shelter, temporarily sheltering beside street corners, high-rise buildings, and houses with crowded populations is also effective.

Place Air Defense Clothing Beside the Bed

When going to bed, air defense clothing or other clothing suitable for air defense work should be placed beside the bed. If a bomb falls and explodes nearby, shattering the windows of the house, residents inside should not walk barefoot in the room. Looking at the area where the bomb fell during the air raid on the 15th, many residents nearby were cut on their feet because they ran around barefoot in the dark searching for clothes. It can be seen the danger of this kind of action. The thicker the air defense clothing, the better. This point is also superfluous.

Store Glass Cups and Bottles Properly

When heavy bombs, such as those dropped in the daytime on that day, fall, in addition to the gale generated, the nearby area will also be subject to some vibration, which is enough to cause glass cups and bottles to fall and break. In order to protect these utensils from unnecessary damage, they should be stored in a safe place.

The Importance of Evacuating During Air Raids

The number of casualties during the air raid that day was very small, mostly because there were not many pedestrians on the road at that early morning hour. This shows the importance of evacuating during air raids. Citizens must know that during enemy air raids on this city, it is in their own interest to evacuate as soon as possible.

Investigate the Safety of Residents in the Bombed Area

After the air raid occurred that day, there seemed to be some confusion in the area near the bombed area. Therefore, after any bombing in the future, the first important step is to investigate whether the residents in the bombed area are safe, injured, or missing. At the same time, attention should also be paid to whether there is a fire. Any damage to gas pipes, electric wires, water pipes, and main water pipes should also be investigated to avoid waste and the occurrence of fires.

Have Sufficient Food and Drink for Several Days

All citizens must have sufficient water, at least enough for two or three days of drinking and cooking, and within a possible range, store emergency food that can be used for two or three days. Citizens in the bombed area will inevitably be busy with other work after the bombing and will not have time to go elsewhere to purchase daily necessities. We cannot determine the time and place of enemy air raids, so we must store large amounts of water in time for firefighting. As for the fact that every family must always prepare readily available air defense equipment, it goes without saying.

Stay Calm and Do Not Panic

After an air raid, citizens must not panic excessively, but should remain calm. Unnecessary panic or alarm will cause unnecessary damage. If you can remain calm as usual, you can be safe and sound.

Rotating Exhibition of Bombed Photos

(Another Report) The Civil Air Defense Headquarters of the city, in order to make citizens aware of the bombed situation, specially took various photos of the bombed area and rotated them to various districts for exhibition. They are now available for viewing in the lantern window of the Shanghai Electric Power Company at the intersection of Nanjing Road and Jiangxi Road.

Social Services

### Rescue Medical Loan Office Established, Accepting Applications Regularly

The Rescue Medical Loan Office, initiated by enthusiastic people in the society, aims to help poor patients. It will start accepting applications from the 23rd of this month. Those who reside in the old districts 1-8 and the factory, shop, and office workers and technicians in Zhabei, teachers and staff of schools, office workers of the Post Office and Customs, immediate family members and legally married spouses of the above three types of personnel, and students (limited to themselves) who suffer from acute internal medical diseases or surgical conditions requiring emergency surgery and cannot afford treatment may bring their residence permit to Room 319 on the third floor of No. 89 Sima Road (west end of Sichuan Road) every day from 10:00 AM to 5:00 PM (closed on Sundays and holidays) to apply according to the regulations. If approved, the office may provide an interest-free loan for part or all of the medical expenses for treatment at the following designated hospitals: Red Cross First Hospital, Red Cross Third Hospital, Shanghai Local Hospital, Tongren Second Hospital, Nanyang Hospital, Tongde Hospital, Jimin Hospital, Shanghai Epidemic Hospital, Siming Hospital, Shanghai Children's Hospital, Radium Treatment Institute, Zhenxin Epidemic Hospital, Nanshi Relief Hospital.

Love of Compatriots: Mr. Lu Guannan wrote: "I have always admired your organization for its tireless efforts in social services and its remarkable achievements that have won the support and sympathy of all walks of life. In admiration, I will do my best to raise 200,000 Central Reserve Coupons to be used as various subsidies for your organization. Although this small amount will not help much, I hope that it will be accumulated to form a table and accumulate sand to form a tower. I hope that it will not be despised for its smallness. Please allocate the funds as follows: 100,000 yuan for the Shen Bao Scholarship, 50,000 yuan for the Shen Bao Medical Assistance Fund, and 50,000 yuan for the Shen Bao Midwifery Assistance Fund, totaling 200,000 yuan.

### National Volunteer Corps of Japan

To strengthen the homeland defense posture, the long-awaited "National Volunteer Corps" has finally been established. The following is a discussion with the authorities regarding its purpose, organization, and operation:

Question: What is the mission and purpose of the National Volunteer Corps?

Answer: The purpose of the National Volunteer Corps organization determined this time is to prepare for the defense of the homeland in cooperation with the military when the homeland becomes a battlefield. That is, to establish the so-called national total armed posture, to closely link defense and production, to strengthen it dramatically, and to prepare to complete the posture of everyone taking up arms in an emergency. However, the organization of the National Volunteer Corps is not an organization that immediately takes up weapons to engage in combat in an emergency. The armed team organization for that kind of occasion and its dispatch must be based on special measures of the law. In other words, the National Volunteer Corps is an organization that can be further transformed into an armed team to attack the enemy. Each member of the volunteer corps is to actively engage in the duties prescribed for them with the spirit of a first-line soldier engaging in hand-to-hand combat to protect the country.

In the event of an enemy landing, the task of supplementing the transportation of weapons, ammunition, and food to assist the military will of course require the organization of armed teams to execute, which will require special measures.

**Personnel from Various Industries are Organized into Teams**

Question: How is the Volunteer Corps organized?

Answer: The organization of the Volunteer Corps is in principle organized by city and village subdivisions. In addition, industrial sectors such as government offices, companies, factories, and enterprises that have a considerable number of personnel are also organized separately.

When organizing by occupation and region, care must be taken to avoid impairing production and other business operations. As for the Volunteer Corps organized by area such as urban areas and villages, the units are based on villages and neighborhood associations, with a minimum of ten to thirty people.

Furthermore, cooks form cooking teams, carpenters form work teams, and coachmen form transportation teams, and teams are organized according to their characteristics to make use of their special skills.

Question: What are the conditions for joining the Volunteer Corps?

Answer: Except for the elderly, the weak, and pregnant and lactating women, all men between the ages of graduation from elementary school in the national school system and 65, and women under the age of 45, must participate. However, women under the age of 44 who are the main members of the family are in principle not required to participate. As for schools, separate student teams are organized. If they are dispatched to perform the aforementioned work, they are members of the National Volunteer Corps.

The National Volunteer Corps organized in this way will have its headquarters in the metropolis, prefectures, and counties, and the local official will serve as the headquarters chief, governing the Volunteer Corps within the area. The heads of the city, ward, town, and village teams will be appointed by the mayors, ward chiefs, town chiefs, and village chiefs. The heads of the Volunteer Corps organized by the industrial sector will be appointed by the heads of the respective professional groups. In addition, those who are in a position to guide the Volunteer Corps will adopt a policy of encouraging knowledgeable people from both the government and the private sector to step forward and cooperate.

Question: What is the operational policy?

**To Assist in Various Tasks**

Answer: Regarding the military use of the Volunteer Corps, when dispatched to assist the military, they are under the command of the respective army and navy unit commanders; when dispatched to assist police defense activities, they are under the command of the respective government office chiefs; when dispatched to other tasks, they act according to the requirements of the respective construction or work implementers. The dispatch of the Volunteer Corps requires the army and navy unit commanders, government office chiefs, and construction or business implementers to request the local governor to dispatch them, and they act upon the local governor's order.

When organizing and operating, special attention should be paid to avoid friction with veterans' associations and fire brigades, in order to achieve both. In this organization, veterans and special fire brigade members participate as a whole. When not acting as a veteran or fire brigade member, they act as members of the Volunteer Corps. As for the relationship with existing organizations such as the Imperial Rule Assistance Association's young men's corps, the Industrial Patriotic Association, and the Commercial Patriotic Association, it is the same as before, and there is no hindrance even if they act as members of the Labor Patriotic Corps and the Women's Volunteer Corps.

Question: When is the best time to organize?

Answer: There is no deadline for when the Volunteer Corps organization will be completed. The local group is now taking a policy of immediate implementation. The National Volunteer Corps does not implement the dawn mobilization and formal training and ceremonies that were previously carried out by veterans' associations and the like.

### Worthy of Imitation: Tokyo Air Defense Housing - "Tokyo Metropolitan Dugout" Construction Method

The Tokyo Metropolitan Defense Bureau, regarding the housing problem for Tokyo citizens under arms, had previously designed a simple underground or semi-underground house that saves on materials and labor and is suitable for durability and blast resistance. It has now been completed and is called the "Tokyo Metropolitan Dugout," and has been publicly announced. On March 19, the Provisional Capital Assembly passed a budget of 5,344,000 yen for the capital authorities to first construct basic models for guidance in each district and township association, a total of several units in the entire city, and then guide the general public to construct them.

**Extremely Material-Saving**

The characteristic of this "Tokyo Metropolitan Dugout" is that it can be built with limited materials and labor. In addition, because its form is semi-underground, it can withstand a certain degree of machine gun strafing, as well as bomb fragments and small incendiary bombs. It is truly a good temporary residence under scorched earth tactics, and it is also an air-raid shelter for evacuation and can also be used as a storage place for storing materials, possessing various good conditions.

The standard specifications initially built by the Tokyo Township Association are similar to a raised floor, six tatami mats (one tatami mat is about 18 square feet) per room, with about one tsubo (six square feet) of earthen floor (mud floor inside the house). Following this example, four and a half, three, or six tatami mats can also be made.

As for the materials required, old materials taken from buildings demolished during forced evacuation can be used, or a portion of existing houses can be further dismantled. As for labor, the Tokyo Township Association's neighborhood association already has the manpower. However, the capital authorities are currently consulting with various labor relations departments.

Technical guidance is provided by the Emergency Construction Department of the Capital Defense Bureau, which has unveiled the sign of the "Tokyo Metropolitan Dugout Construction Consultation Center," and the construction section of each district's defense division is also responsible for consulting with the general public. An actual sample of the "Tokyo Metropolitan Dugout" has been completed in front of the public hall in Hibiya Park. Also, the cost required is roughly around 1,000 yen for a six-tatami mat.

**Glimpses of Advantages**

According to the chief of the General Affairs Section and the chief of the Construction Section of the Capital Defense Bureau, who created this "Tokyo Metropolitan Dugout," the details are as follows:

Question: What is the style?

Answer: If possible, a completely underground style should be adopted, but due to geological problems and hygiene problems such as lighting and ventilation, the semi-underground style is now being adopted. It is very effective in air defense, and there are no problems in terms of hygiene.

Question: What about areas with springs, such as downtown?

Answer: Dig down within the waterless range, and all the soil can be piled up around it.

Question: How is the transportation of materials done?

Answer: This is closely related to the construction site. It depends on the evacuation situation of the building. It can be built on open spaces where houses have already been demolished, and in locations that do not interfere with fire fighting activities, evacuation, and air-raid shelter construction. As for the problem of transporting secondary materials, it can be solved with horse-drawn carriages or trucks.

Question: Is it permissible to build dugouts on open spaces where houses have already been burned down?

Answer: In general, before the fundamental plan for reconstruction is drawn up, a policy of temporarily prohibiting it is adopted in principle, but after investigating the terrain and land conditions, if it is indeed suitable for building dugouts, we plan to designate appropriate locations and allow construction.

Question: How does it feel to live in a dugout?

Answer: It is not only safe but also very comfortable. Ventilation and lighting are certainly not as good as above-ground housing, but it is warm in winter and cool in summer. The temperature is also better than the air-raid shelters around a building. (Translated from the Yomiuri Hochi, March 21)

### Roosevelt's Death and the Relationship between Chongqing and the United States

At this time of great urgency in the international political situation, U.S. President Roosevelt suddenly passed away. The people in Chongqing were probably the most shocked and dismayed by the news of Roosevelt's sudden death. This is because the so-called U.S.-Chiang cooperation was not based on trust in the United States in reality, but rather on expectations for Roosevelt personally. There is no need for us to point out the extremely cunning attitude of Britain towards China, and the authorities in Chongqing have already experienced it. As for the U.S.'s attitude towards China, it is somewhat different, and it is what Chongqing has been yearning for.

Many people in Chongqing often praised the progressiveness and idealism of the United States, and we can still hear this kind of admiration around us. However, the United States is essentially no different from Britain. Yet why do people in Chongqing have a different feeling towards the U.S. than they do towards Britain and approach the U.S.? Franklin Roosevelt has a great deal to do with this. Roosevelt, who has been the dictator of the United States for twelve years, has led Chongqing to the illusion that Roosevelt is the United States. Roosevelt was the instigator of the Greater East Asia War and the most virtuous and loyal believer in American imperialism. His disguise was an air of idealism, which allowed him to connect with Chongqing in a skillful manner that was almost genius.

To give an analogy, Roosevelt's existence is like the sugar coating on a pill of American imperialism that Chongqing is swallowing. Everyone likes to eat sugar, and after twelve long years, this layer of sugar coating is quite thick. Roosevelt personally took great care not to directly give this bitter medicine of American imperialism to Chongqing, and Chongqing was quite wary of this pill. The smart officials in Chongqing only hoped to taste the sugar coating of this dangerous pill appropriately. Chongqing knew early on that U.S.-Chiang cooperation had considerable dangers.

We can find several concrete examples. For example, the recall of Stilwell last autumn is one such example. This man, with the violent nature of an American Indian, had been strongly demanding that the Chongqing army under his command immediately mobilize for the war against Japan for the sake of the United States since he was ordered to go to Chongqing. To hand over the command tower, which was no different from the life of Chongqing, was something that Chiang could not tolerate. Therefore, the fierce friction between Stilwell and Chiang was ultimately unavoidable. Foreign journalists reported on this matter at the time. The solution to this problem was Roosevelt's recall of him to the United States on the grounds of "Stilwell's personal character."

Although Roosevelt was criticized by domestic public opinion for this matter, Chongqing was saved for the time being, and the friction between the U.S. and Chongqing was lubricated. The political significance of Roosevelt's existence can be seen from this.

The same thing can also be seen in the remarks made by Ambassador Hurley upon his return to the United States. The US public opinion and military are determined to unify the two armies of the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, and if things continue like this, the United States and Chongqing will inevitably fall into a frontal confrontation. It was still Roosevelt's skillful disguise that eased this strained situation. As the Pacific War progressed, the US Congress's ambition to permanently place island after island under the Stars and Stripes did not particularly stimulate Chongqing. One of the reasons for this is that the important figure feels at ease with the existence of idealist Roosevelt.

In the US Congress's concern for the Greater East Asia, Chongqing or China is not worthy of their consideration. All they have is aggression and territorial desire. There is nothing that can resonate with the new Chinese nationalism. Its naked true face is hidden behind the idealistic curtain of Roosevelt.

Now, this sugar coating, this curtain, has been removed forever. It is difficult to expect the new president, Truman, who succeeds him, to have the seasoned skills of Roosevelt, who has been the dictator of the United States for twelve years, to handle the international political situation, as well as the power to suppress Congress. As for the color of idealism, it is even more unnecessary to talk about it. Due to the lack of strength of the successor and the loss of idealism, the future steps of the Allied powers will of course be decisively affected. At the same time, the US's ability to act towards China will be like a war chariot controlled by a madman, disregarding the consequences and doing whatever it wants.

Whenever Chongqing encounters a difficult situation in its relationship with the United States, it can never find a solution. Chongqing has no other way but to come out and solve the problem. In the near future, Chongqing will experience the true face of the United States. (Translated from the Continental New Daily, April 15)

### How to Stabilize People's Livelihood

— Zhou Bangjun

Since January of the 34th year, Shanghai factories have mostly suspended or reduced work due to power restrictions and difficulties in sourcing raw materials. Shops have goods but no buyers due to reduced social purchasing power. On the contrary, the prices of daily necessities have broken last year's records, soaring and hovering, with little hope of decline. As a result, people's livelihood is becoming increasingly difficult.

Under these circumstances, the number of unemployed people in society has increased, and even those who are employed cannot enjoy their work. Because factories have stopped production, workers have no work, and daily expenses cannot be neglected. They are wandering and do not know where to go. Shops are deserted by customers, and the sales income is often insufficient to cover expenses. It is already difficult to maintain their own survival, and they cannot take care of the family life of unemployed workers. As a result, it is difficult to stabilize people's livelihood, and it is difficult to ensure social order.

Although the authorities are now engaged in evacuation as a radical solution, because the communication speed is accelerated, it is necessary to plan measures to stabilize the above-mentioned facts, so that a good and peaceful order can be maintained. The following are my humble opinions:

**Expand Small-Amount Loans**

Silver and money businesses originally had the responsibility of adjusting social finance. In the past, the targets of loans were mostly factories and shops. In this autumn of depression in all industries, in order to prevent floating capital from tending to speculation and manipulation, it seems appropriate to focus on small-amount loans so that a portion of the unemployed people can use the borrowed funds to seek survival opportunities.

**Promote Small Handicrafts**

Small handicrafts were originally our country's inherent industry. Since the introduction of machine-made industries, small handicrafts have gradually been eliminated. However, in order to adapt to the actual environment and provide relief for unemployment, it seems appropriate to pay attention to promoting and rewarding them. Those who are not familiar with production skills can set up institutions to be responsible for training.

**Use Waste to Make**

Wasting resources is not allowed even in peacetime. When the source of materials is scarce, waste materials should be used as much as possible to make usable objects so that the unemployed can engage in the collection of waste, sort it out, and use it according to its material.

In this way, even if the unemployed have no place to work, they still have the opportunity to get work, and the country cannot guarantee that there will be no shortage of food and clothing. The current difficulties may be solved as a result. As for those who are employed but cannot enjoy their work, the reason is nothing more than that the cost of living is too high and the income cannot offset the expenditure. But if they can engage in the commission of serious life and use their leisure time, they may be able to solve their current difficulties. Therefore, I declare:

**Cultivation of Serious Life**

A decadent view of life is a shortcut to ruin and disgrace. During this period, we should restrain ourselves and use reasonable income for reasonable expenses. Knowing that the threat to life is getting worse day by day, if we can endure hardship, we may be able to cope with any eventuality. If we "get drunk today with the wine we have today," we are abandoning our bright future. At this time, if we can be serious about our private lives, we can feel physically and mentally comfortable.

**Use of Leisure Time**

The more you use your thoughts, the more agile they become, and the more diligent you work, the more skilled you become. In the past, we were addicted to comfort, but in the future, we should try to correct it. Moreover, in order to seek the stability of our own lives, we should use our leisure time to engage in production work, part-time jobs, and side businesses, no matter how big or small the work is. Anything that can increase income can be done. If we are accustomed to idleness and extravagance, although we will gradually decline, we will also be socially responsible.

In short, economizing and increasing income were originally the key to establishing a family and a career. In this environment, we should follow it as a guide. If we do not distinguish between these, not only will those who are employed not be able to enjoy their work, but the result will also be unemployment.

Furthermore, stabilizing people's livelihood cannot be achieved by empty words, nor can it be effective by simply providing relief to the unemployed and the employed. There are many problems. Let me give three examples:

**Unblock the Source of Daily Necessities**

The straight-line increase in the prices of daily necessities is enough to shake the stability of people's livelihood. Food, oil, salt, and fuel are all daily necessities, and we must find ways to unblock the supply of resources and encourage procurement and transportation so that prices can be leveled and the people's burden can be reduced.

**Eliminate Speculation**

Speculation is similar to gambling, which is enough to encourage the bad habit of getting something for nothing and to stimulate the rise in general prices. Moreover, rumors are spread deliberately, and people are confused. Social peace and order cannot be maintained as a result. Therefore, without effective countermeasures, it is difficult to eliminate the root of the problem.

**Strict Suppression of Consumption Places**

Social figures are engaged in speculative transactions, and legitimate industrial and commercial enterprises are unable to receive support. Moreover, because it is easy to come by, they gradually become extravagant. Unnecessary children's places are born as a result, not only consuming resources but also cultivating the bad habit of relying on luck for security and seizing by trickery.

All of these are the main causes that make people's livelihood unstable. Therefore, stabilizing people's livelihood should be done through many efforts. Otherwise, it will be difficult to ensure social peace and order. Bangjun only briefly describes the temporary solution for the current situation. As for a permanent solution, it still needs to be discussed by experts.

### Talking about Air-Raid Shelters Again

— Meng Weiyong

There are now air-raid shelters in this city that can be found every few steps, but most of them are just decorations that have been perfunctorily done. We can find the following problems anytime and anywhere:

*   Digging is too shallow, and some depths are less than two feet.
*   The height of the bamboo shed mostly exceeds the depth of the hole, so its risk of being hit by shrapnel is greater. Moreover, the bamboo shed is not firmly erected. The exterior is only plastered with wet soil, and the interior is all dry and loose soil, which is prone to cracks and collapses at any time.
*   Rainwater accumulates, and mosquitoes and flies breed, which is unhygienic.
*   Air defense work should be fast, but most of the holes are dug without building sheds, so they cannot cope with emergencies.
*   The construction is not solid; there is a risk of collapse even before the shrapnel arrives. Not only can it not protect life, but it will also be buried by the air-raid shelter.
*   Most air-raid shelters are built on sidewalks, which are very likely to be crushed by nearby houses during bombing, leading people to their deaths.
*   Air-raid shelters are not managed.

Therefore, I suggest the following points for the relevant authorities to refer to:

Judging from the above points, the biggest problem is the lack of a comprehensive plan and good guidance, resulting in perfunctory work. Therefore, the authorities should establish an air-raid shelter promotion committee to be responsible for guiding and supervising the public on how to dig, ordering each neighborhood head to report the location and digging situation of the air-raid shelter, and directly sending personnel to review the location to see if it is qualified, so as to avoid perfunctory fraud.

In order to avoid collapses and easy penetration by shrapnel, it is advisable to use brick and cement construction (such as the Laojiefu gate on Nanjing Road), digging the bottom as much as possible.

In order to avoid being affected by the collapse of nearby houses, you should choose an open space to dig. It is best to ask the authorities to build large-scale and solid air-raid shelters in open spaces or parks, such as the Racecourse and the Bund Park.

The cleanliness and order of the air-raid shelter can be assigned to nearby self-defense teams. A sign should be hung outside the door stating "Number of People Who Can Be Accommodated" to avoid unexpected accidents caused by temporary crowding.

Along the Jing'an Temple Road of the Racecourse, there is a small cement ditch (from the New World to Xinchang Road), about five feet wide and more than four feet deep. Some of it has been blocked by sweat and emits an foul odor, which is harmful to hygiene in hot weather. You may wish to remove the sewage and rebuild many air-raid shelters; not only are they solid, but they are also deeper than ordinary air-raid shelters, and there is no collapse of civilian houses around them, which is very suitable for building standards. If the authorities can use this ditch, it will not only benefit hygiene but also benefit air defense. It is a win-win situation.

### On Early Ending of School

— Jiang Yu

It is heard that the school authorities, in view of the urgency of the situation, are preparing to end the semester's courses early; as for future measures, there are no specific regulations.

I believe that if we only end the semester's studies early to cope with the current situation, the method is not perfect, because this will inevitably disregard the studies of young students and will inevitably cover the lives of teachers and staff.

It is true that, from the perspective of the school itself, there will be many difficulties in continuing to operate in the future, such as bombing, such as the material conditions of high prices,... These are undeniable facts. But even if there are difficulties, the difficulties are not impossible to overcome and remedy. Shanghai is the center for schools after the war. There are countless young students who are cultivating talents for the society and the country. The schools should not be allowed to close down.

Secondly, the lives of the teachers and staff of the various schools are already at the end of their ropes. If the schools are to be generally closed in the future, cutting off their livelihoods, the difficulty of their situation can be imagined!

Just based on the above two points, I believe that the school authorities should take into account the following three aspects when dealing with the wood problem: (A) How to make the education industry suitable for the special situation of Shanghai in the future; (B) How to allow the majority of young students to continue their studies; (C) How to allow the professor to save the teacher to maintain his life. In order to take into account the above three points, I will describe my humble opinion for the school authorities to refer to and adopt:

After the early end of the spring semester, classes should be started immediately, adopting a three-semester system for one academic year, or opening summer schools. This point has already been created by several universities and middle schools. If unnecessary subjects and academic programs are suspended, the students' study time can be shortened, and it is in line with the wartime environment and needs.

In order to avoid indiscriminate bombing by enemy aircraft in the future, methods should be found to find another location immediately. Under this situation, we can take: dispersed classes, use the school sites of other schools, and merge several schools to form joint classes.

Open joint universities and joint middle schools in safe areas to disperse some schools and students; this point was discussed in detail by the Qingzhou director of the Rehe Teaching Department in the Shenbao Weekly Review; however, to date, there are no concrete measures to implement it, so I deeply hope that the authorities can actively support and assist it, and the school authorities should give up all private concerns and plans for the sake of the students' studies and discuss the relocation methods with each other.

The above points are only briefly discussed from the perspective of my humble opinion. Shallowness is inevitable, and there will be many difficulties in implementation. I hope that throwing bricks and attracting jade can cause discussion among enthusiastic education people so that the problem of the schools in Shanghai can be properly solved in the future.

### Improving Air Raid Shelters

— Xu Yuhang

Air raid shelters are established to safeguard the safety of the people, but most of the air raid shelters in this city are far from ideal. For example:

Air raid shelters without roofs have the following situations:

When it rains, they are filled with rainwater, turning the air raid shelter into a reservoir. Now that the weather is getting hotter, mosquitoes breed, making it a breeding ground for disease.

Over time, garbage accumulates, which is unsanitary. It was reported that a dead child was found in an air raid shelter on South Yi Bei Road.

At night, the street lights are dim, and citizens may fall into the air raid shelters if they are not careful. It's fine when it's sunny, but it's a disaster when it rains!

Air raid shelters with roofs—that is, those with bamboo frames covered with earth on top of the pit—are often used as residences by beggars, or as places for people to smoke opium.

To prevent the above situations, I have the following suggestions for the authorities to consider:

Air raid shelters without roofs cannot prevent the falling of high-explosive shrapnel, so a roof must be added to ensure safety. The surrounding soil of the air raid shelter should be one or two inches higher than the ground to prevent rainwater from flowing in.

The air raid shelter should be guarded by the Self-Defense Corps to prevent children from playing inside; if a dead child is found, the on-duty corps member should be responsible. If beggars enter the air raid shelter, the on-duty corps member should drive them away.

A red light should be hung on top of the air raid shelter at night, so that citizens will not fall in when passing by.

### Freezing Gold

— Yi

Recently, speculative funds have flocked to gold speculation, causing rapid changes in the market. Gold is not directly related to people's livelihood, but recently, commodity prices in this city have shown signs of rising. The municipal authorities have expressed their intention to thoroughly investigate gold speculation, but the only way to eliminate speculation is to temporarily freeze gold in this city:

First, silver and money businesses should immediately stop using gold as collateral for loans; they should report gold that has already been used as collateral to the authorities for freezing.

Second, temporarily prohibit the sale and purchase of gold bars and gold ornaments, or the use of gold as a means of purchasing goods, to prevent the current speculative funds in the form of gold from flowing to commodity speculation again. Violators will have their gold confiscated.

Third, prohibit the carrying of gold and gold products out of Shanghai.

If the above measures can be taken, it will not only stop the price of gold from rising again, but also freeze speculative funds, which is a fundamental way to eliminate speculation.

In extraordinary times, only extraordinary measures can be taken. It is hoped that the municipal authorities will study this.

### Water

— Hou Qianli

With a crack of lightning, the landlady announced: The water meter has reached its limit, and no water is allowed for the next six or seven days.

The building was immediately in an uproar. Some people even wanted to take a lead bucket to the tap to act when the opportunity arose, but the fat landlady personally guarded it, one person holding the pass, truly unmatched by ten thousand men.

The Ningbo woman in the small room was the first to complain, citing many pieces of evidence to prove that her family had not used too much water, and that she even used the same water for washing her feet that she used for other purposes. Therefore, reaching the limit was truly unjust, and the innocent were suffering.

This naturally caused some dissatisfaction, so Mr. Li, a teacher from the back building, stood up:

"Mrs. Sun, you can't say that. Water is for everyone to use. This time, everyone has to take some responsibility. For example, Mrs. Sun, doesn't she use a drop of water? Has she never used it? You can't say that."

"I use it, but we save it," Mrs. Sun said, "We even wash our feet..."

"What's the use of that? For example, if a student fails an exam, no matter how much he says he studied hard before, it won't be of any use, right? Now, basically..."

Mr. Li suddenly realized that this "for example" was not very appropriate for Mrs. Sun, so he stopped talking and changed his tone:

"The important thing now is that everyone doesn't have water. We have to think of a way to get water."

So everyone started discussing it again. The landlady was not coming to participate, first, because she had to guard the tap to prevent anyone from smuggling water. Second, honestly, she had already stored two tanks of water. For these few days, she wouldn't have to worry about not having water.

Someone suggested borrowing water from the neighbors. The first person was relatively successful, borrowing half a lead bucket of water to cook rice. The second time, the owner refused, the reason being:

"We're almost out ourselves."

So someone went to think of a way in the opposite alley, because there was a well over there, and well water was not limited. The person who went was Mrs. Li, the wife of the middle school teacher. The people in the opposite alley agreed, but there was also someone watching by the well, and each person was only allowed one lead bucket, and they had to line up, one by one.

Regardless, it was better than suffering without a drop of water.

"This is called drinking water and thinking of the source, always knowing that it is not easy to come by," Mr. Li said to his children during dinner. He was "forgetting no opportunity for education."

"Isn't that right? Even a bowl of soup takes a long walk to get," Mrs. Li, having experienced it herself, of course knew more details. "Having lived for thirty or forty years, this is the first time I've suffered like this."

The water for washing faces was of course saved. Everyone just wiped their faces on a towel and finished. Mr. Li found that this was also good, not only saving water, but also saving time. Not having water had its advantages after all, he thought.

But a bottle of boiled water was indispensable. Since hearing a lecture by a medical doctor, Mr. Li had never stopped drinking a large glass of boiled water after dinner every day for four or five years (he originally advocated drinking at least three large glasses a day). Even if it was not easy to come by, health was still important. It wasn't worth losing one's health for a bit of water. Besides, it hadn't reached the point of being completely without water.

As soon as he drank the boiled water, he noticed a strange taste in the water, like rotten mud, or like rotten vegetable roots. He asked his wife to smell it, and it was the same. He asked his children to smell it again, and it was the same.

This made Mr. Li very surprised. He went around asking, and the results were all the same. Someone asked:

"Mr. Li, you're a teacher, what's the reason for this?"

"It's the well water," Mr. Li finally understood: "If the well is opened and not used, it will be like this."

The children, being nervous, began to complain of stomachaches, so the parents were busy running up and down, asking if other people's children had the same feeling, asking if they had been poisoned, and what kind of quick-acting medicine to take, and panicking, as if something terrible had happened.

Mr. Li was a teacher after all, and he had the spirit of that elementary school teacher in "Under the Eaves of Shanghai." Look at him, this time he stopped a woman who was about to run out to call a doctor.

"It's okay, Mrs. Wang," he said, calmly taking a puff of his inferior cigarette: "I guarantee it's okay, I promise you'll be fine in a while! Don't worry, nothing will happen. Absolutely not."

"But this child keeps crying about a stomachache, almost rolling on the ground," the woman said dubiously.

"That's psychological. I understand," Mr. Li explained: "There's probably no poison in the well water."

After persuading the woman to go back, Mr. Li returned to his room.

"What to do? There's no water again today, should we go to that well to get it?" his wife greeted him.

"Don't go, think of a way somewhere else," he said. Even though he said it was okay, the taste was really bad.

"Where else is there?" his wife asked back, taking a breath; "Sigh! These days, even water is becoming a resource. It's a joke, I've never heard of it before. Where did this start?"

This really aroused a lot of emotion in Mr. Li. People living in the world should have as much water as they need, which was originally a gift from God to everyone, and should not have any restrictions...

But who could he tell these theories to? What was happening was a fact, they had no water to use, no water to drink, and couldn't even get a drop of water.

The more they didn't have water, the more things they needed water for. For example, a guest came to see Mr. Li and talked for three hours without being offered a cup of tea. Mr. Li had to honestly tell his colleague that his family was out of water:

"Regarding water," he said, "we have become like longing for rain in a great drought."

So the two of them laughed loudly, shaking the dust off the ceiling.

This was a small matter. Today there was no water to cook rice. Without water, raw rice cannot be cooked into cooked rice. Of course, no one wanted to go to the well in the opposite alley again. Moreover, honestly, even if someone wasn't afraid of the taste and still planned to get a lead bucket, they wouldn't be allowed to anymore. The person watching the alley had already warned:

"Please be considerate. We each contributed five hundred yuan for this well. We haven't even had enough ourselves, and we're already treating guests! Where in the world are there such good people?"

Mr. Li suddenly remembered seeing people waiting for water at the red taps on the road every day. He thought he might as well try. It didn't require any capital or effort.

"Tell A-Guan to go to the tap on the road to get some water," he said to his wife, as if discovering a new continent: "Hurry up, don't let others know, it'll be troublesome if there are too many people."

"Can you use the water from the road?" his wife seemed afraid to act rashly: "What if the police see it?"

"It's usable. Every day I see a lot of people surrounding the tap, lead buckets, basins, everything. If they can use it, why can't we?" Mr. Li said righteously.

So twelve-year-old A-Guan was sent out with a lead bucket.

The landlady's voice rang out from downstairs.

"Who's shameless? Who's shameless? If you have the ability, come down, dare to come down and try turning it on!"

Then the Ningbo woman in the small room also refused to be outdone, raising her voice as much as possible:

"You dirty thing! Shameless, you hoarded two tanks of water yourself, but you won't let others use a drop!"

Mr. Li stepped out. He felt responsible for mediating the quarrel between the wives.

"Mr. Li, you're knowledgeable, give a fair judgment!" The landlady seemed to have support, and her voice was even louder: "I didn't turn off the tap for no reason, everyone refused to conserve, what can I do if the meter reached its limit? But they say I'm shameless, where am I shameless? People from Ningbo are the most unreasonable, I've never seen..."

"You hoarded two tanks..." the Ningbo woman repeated the reason.

"Okay, why bother?" Mr. Li said with a long face and a smile: "Why bother? Everyone is helpless, what's the point of arguing? If there's no water, everyone's the same..."

"That's right! I don't know who's shameless, blah blah blah..." the landlady flashed two gold teeth.

"Alright, leave it," Mr. Li quietly advised: "Landlady, say a few less words, really, what's the point of arguing? But, when will the water come back? It's really inconvenient without water."

"These days, I can't hide it from you, Mr. Li, being a landlord is really a thankless job, other people see..."

Regardless of how other people saw it, a child from next door ran in like a race.

"Mrs. Wu, there's a child here who was beaten on the road..."

"Where?" Mr. Li's whole body trembled.

"Next to the tap, people wouldn't let him wait for water, he was beaten and bled..."

Before he could finish speaking, Mr. Li had already pushed open the door and strode out.

### Freedom—Reply to Liu Lin

— Yi Fan

Reading your "Brief Letter", I felt a warm comfort, but also a little unease at being misunderstood. I am extremely willing to accept well-intentioned criticism from friends, sometimes even harshness—as long as it is sincere; however, I also hope that my friends can calm down a bit and listen to my confession, which is not a naked self-justification. In this way, we can have a deeper friendship and a deeper understanding.

Living in the exploited class of society, and personally experiencing all kinds of embarrassment and injustice, I am constantly depressed, indignant, and sometimes feel a bit of sadness and loneliness; but I have no intention of taking a little warmth from my memory, because there is no warmth to speak of in my memory. The re-chewing of the past in "Reunion", if there is anything relatively sweet, is only a bit of occasional vicissitudes, perhaps this is also a waste of people's emotions. I say that your studies are better than mine, you can have the enthusiasm to pursue ideals, which is commendable. So I hope you can hold on to school life; but it is not to isolate you from society, and every day with a cavity of enthusiasm in the void "pursue" the ideal, my meaning is just that you should take advantage of the time before entering society, while you still have a free body, to use knowledge and physical strength to fill your enthusiasm. And because your situation is not much better than mine, you may lose your schooling at any time, so I feel more and more that it is not easy for you to study now, and I shout it out for you. But from this, you think that as soon as I enter society, I lose the enthusiasm to pursue ideals, but this is not the case. Society gives me coldness, gives me tyranny, I admit that I have been extinguished some enthusiasm by those vampires, but from this I also got a valuable lesson, that is: a firm belief is better than a hollow enthusiasm. And fragile emotions sometimes confuse my direction in life. I began to understand the need for calm, I want to use a calm attitude to identify, to resist, to attack, ... However, my friend! I have to feel here that my words are too "enthusiastic", in fact, if I don't "jump out of the shackles of life by myself, and return to me a free life," it is very difficult for me to have the possibility of attacking. You don't understand "life" here, but you should understand. Of course, it refers to the family's burden that cannot be escaped. For the sake of the family's lowest life, I can only swallow my anger, and exchange a large amount of energy for meager rewards, I can not use justice and reason to push against those who exploit me. These words, only those who are in the same situation as me can feel the certainty, the heaviness. As for some friends, they may accuse me of not having courage, tending to be passive, but haven't I been indignant? Just if I "willfully", I will see the hungry faces of my loved ones! Think about it, if I never jump out by myself, how can I do the work I want to do? To achieve my hopes? (And people don't want to have self-consoling dreams.) So I said the following few sentences. Can you understand my difficulties? Thank you for your encouragement, yes, I am facing the hardships of life, and I will take resisting these hardships as comfort. I have long abandoned those illusory comforts, no, it can also be said that I never wanted any illusory comforts. But precisely because I want to face the various hardships in this vast world, and gather the strength of my partners to fight, I thought about jumping out of the shackles of life by myself. Otherwise, as you said, I only see my own life and family, why can't I be like those who "climb up", to concentrate on scheming and flattering? In this way, soon, wouldn't I be able to make my own and my family's life a little more prosperous? But my friend, is this what I want?

You say that C in "Reunion" and I merge together, is exactly a portrayal of myself, exaggerating the contradictions in my thinking. This has to surprise me that you still haven't understood me. In fact, how can I hate cities and love remote villages? Both cities and villages are societies composed of humans, and at present, both have more dark sides and fewer bright sides. What I hate is the bad system, the cannibalistic kind, they are both in the city and in the countryside; at the same time, I love beautiful illusions, of course, my ideal is definitely not the so-called partial "construction of the countryside".

Some words, perhaps are exactly what some of the exploited want to say; and if it is worth it for people other than you to see, then this publication is not without meaning.

### Gleanings

— Chen Shi

Old Liu held a roll of banknotes and sighed, "A thousand dollars is really a burden to me!"

I asked in surprise: "Only people suffer from money, how can money cause people suffering?"

"You don't understand the reason, listen to me explain." He sat up straight and said:

"On the second day of the Lunar New Year, Lao Xu and I were having dinner at a colleague's house. There were many guests, and the mahjong table was about to get lively. After dinner, some of the guests left, and the host invited Lao Xu and me to make up the game and reorganize the mahjong table. In less than two rounds, Lao Xu had lost several thousand.

Of all the unfortunate things in the world, this should be one - of course, more unfortunate things are yet to come - you know, Lao Xu can really be called thrifty. I've been with him for some years, and I've never seen him spend an extra penny.

'Lao Liu! Tell me, is there anything more precious than money?' He often says: 'When I was young, I had a lot of fire. I used to talk about fame, morality, learning, and cultivation all day long. As soon as I talked about money, my face would turn red. But, after being in society for a long time, learning and morality don't matter at all, the only thing people worship is money!'

Lao Xu is frugal, but he likes to gamble. When he goes to a colleague's house, he's busy lifting tables and setting up tables. The money he saves so carefully slips away when he shuffles it on the table. We often laugh at him: 'A duck doesn't pee, but there's always a way to spend it.'

Think about it, how sad he must have been to lose so much money! He had to count the money several times before a hand was even won.

'Four thousand five hundred and ten yuan!' He scratched his head and muttered: 'No! Four thousand five hundred and fifty.'

'Hey! Do you want a five of Wan?' The player on his right impatiently reminded him with his elbow: 'Wait a while, don't say I didn't tell you on purpose.'

After finishing the mahjong, we sat on the sofa and chatted.

'I lost six thousand in total,' Lao Xu said, his face flushed red, looking very agitated. He couldn't concentrate on talking.

At this time, a colleague suddenly called out: 'Whose is this two thousand yuan?' He casually found two thousand yuan from the drawer of the table.

As soon as that colleague shouted, Lao Xu jumped up.

'This two thousand yuan is mine!' he said.

Without any fuss, the two thousand yuan went from that colleague's hand to Lao Xu's pocket.

'That's right, absolutely right—' Lao Xu thought for a moment, then announced to the crowd:

'Just now I forgot to count the money in my pocket. I brought twenty thousand in total, ten thousand on the table, and ten thousand in my pocket. Later, I only collected two thousand. I only thought I already had fourteen thousand in my pocket. Now that I've counted, if these two thousand yuan aren't found, there's only twelve thousand left.'

We don't know how much money he brought in his pocket. We can't deny the truth of these words.

Soon, everyone forgot about this little thing. The conversation continued, but Lao Xu was absent-minded, occasionally echoing a word or two, or forcing a few laughs.

One day, Lao Xu came to see me, and as we were talking, he suddenly interrupted and walked to the table, saying, 'Lao Liu, do you remember? At first I was sitting in this seat (he pointed to the seat opposite the one where the banknotes were found), and you were sitting opposite me. After 'Banning', I switched with you. Later, I sat down in the seat on the left, and I left these two thousand yuan here. When you were sitting here, did you open the drawer to look?'

'I didn't,' I said: 'The money is yours, there's no mistake!'

But I couldn't prove it, and Lao Xu seemed unhappy and sat down silently.

The next day, early in the morning, Lao Xu suddenly appeared in my bedroom. We talked casually, and he brought up the two thousand yuan again.

'Those two thousand yuan were supposed to be what I lost!' he stuttered. Then he repeated it again: he forgot that there were twenty-two thousand on the table; he moved from here to the opposite side, and then from there to the left side... and so on.

'You're overthinking it, who said the money isn't yours!' I said: 'You wouldn't take these few thousand dollars to heart.'

'What do you mean by that?' Suddenly, he asked coldly. "What do you mean by that?"

He stood up and said, trembling: 'You're simply a bastard... you despise my personality.' Shame and disgust made him unnatural.

'You say:' The money is yours.' But you don't mean it at all.' He said: 'You're saying in your heart: "Look at him, this guy is definitely feeling guilty." You despise my personality.'

'What do you want me to say?'

'Ask yourself! You're laughing in your heart: "This money is obviously that woman's" You deliberately hid it from me, you think I don't know. You deliberately watched me shamelessly repeat the words of taking other people's money in front of you, you deliberately played with me! Is this still a friend? Your heart is so vicious!'

'I have no way to lay my heart bare for you to see,' I said: 'But, from the bottom of my heart, I don't know anything about that. You bring up a woman for no reason... .'

'Don't you know?' he said: 'The next day, a female guest suddenly announced that the two thousand yuan was hers. She said she had played mahjong, and in her haste, she forgot the money in the drawer. She only realized it the next morning. That is to say, the money was in that drawer before we played cards, and I didn't leave it there. Isn't this obviously a joke? Losing two thousand yuan and only realizing it the next day. But, people actually believed her. They despise my personality, thinking that I have no money, and I lost so much...'

'I haven't heard them say that!'

'Now please give this two thousand yuan to the host,' he said: 'Lao Xu doesn't care. You tell him that the money is clearly Lao Xu's, and now he can just give it to that lowly bitch!' He didn't say anything more and left.

I brought the money to that colleague's house, but the host refused to accept it. He thought it was a very unfortunate thing. Lao Xu would certainly not falsely claim it, and the female guest wouldn't lie either. It must have been a misunderstanding, or perhaps a coincidence. He had already given the female guest two thousand yuan out of his own pocket. And he asked me to return the two thousand yuan to Lao Xu, saying that the female guest was mistaken and had not lost it.

Old Liu sighed and ended the story: "But, Lao Xu refuses to take it back. Tell me, what should I do?"

### Life

— Yu Ruowen

(I)

In the preface to his "Comedy of Life," Mr. Ding Di wrote, "...I realize that the society I live in is a society centered on commerce, a deformed society centered on commerce! Businessmen are, of course, businessmen, but everyone is a businessman. In today's world, there is no culture, no religion, no morality, no education, and no spiritual life worth cherishing or longing for. Everything is just business: a commercialized world, commercialized humanity!"

Yes! Mr. Ding Di's words are incisive and thorough.

Everything is business! Commercialized life, commercialized conversation, commercialized human relationships, even the maintenance of affection between family members requires the help of commerce.

Young people living in such a world all hate it! Hate!

(II)

Is life a play? Yes, life is indeed a play!

I am used to seeing all of life from a distance, like a roc overlooking the world below. I only feel that humanity is foolish and stupid!

However, I am ultimately not a roc. After I realized people's foolishness and stupidity, I was immediately forced to descend and be foolish and stupid with them!

What I have is also a foolish and stupid life! I am silent.

### Bai Ma Cup Grand Football Match Expected Next Week

Since the International Cup finals have become dominated by overseas Chinese teams, football matches have lost their appeal. Unexpectedly, amidst this silence, it is learned that the San You Sports Association is preparing to invite overseas Chinese football teams for a match. In addition, Fu Hua Tobacco Company has decided to hold a "Bai Ma Cup" football match, which has been approved by the Football Association and is scheduled to take place next week (likely on Sunday). The invited teams are Bai Ma against Qiao Lian.

Cheng Bo'an, General Manager of An Hua Tobacco Company, has been a strong advocate for football, sparing no effort. Last summer, he organized the Fu Hua Cup mini-league, which was very popular for a time. This time, he has spared no expense and effort to organize a grand football match. Negotiations with various parties have taken a lot of effort, but everything is now ready. All that remains is for the Football Association to set the date, and a most exciting football match will be presented to the fans.

Bai Ma Recruits Players from Dong Hua and Lian Yi

It has been noted that Bai Ma team players registered with the Football Association cannot be allowed to participate in the match, but their players are from the Dong Hua and Lian Yi members teams. Therefore, Bai Ma officials have issued official letters to the two teams to borrow players. The authorities of the two teams then approved the letters of loan to members and presented them to the Football Association, which was approved by the Football Association. The players are all the soldiers of the Dong Hua A Group. Those borrowed from Lian Yi are Zhu Lingsheng, Li Yichen, and Luo Shoufu. The strength is strong, and the list of players can be imagined.

Two Lineups Proposed for Bai Ma: With Bai Ma collecting famous players, it is possible to capture Qiao Lian. Regardless of who wins or loses, the performance will be excellent. Before this great battle, this magazine offers two lineups for reference by the authorities, choose one to use, and can hope for success. One: Zhang Banglun, Zhang Li, Lin Yigen, Chen Liang, Tang Fu, Song Lingsheng, Li Sun, Shun Dai, Jing Han, Hai Jia, Youliang

Using Zhang and Li as full-backs, their bold and unrestrained style is enough to threaten Qiao Lian's intrusion, and the logic is sufficient. However, the fear is that Zhang and Li have both made over-aggressive fouls in the penalty area when they served as inside-backs. If these two special attention to this point, a pair of iron gates, can almost a new eye for fans. On the center-back line, since Lin Genzhi is shifted later, Zhu Lingsheng is the only one who can do it, such scheduling, is not not always. The forehands have Han Longhai rushed back to help, naturally use the original, remember the most frustrating Dong Hua with Qiao Lian several wars, the offensive opportunity, unfortunately, a lack of such as Longhai can be the inside forward, was defeated, the audience can not help but remember this self-robe young man. Then, General Han arrived, Jia Youliang back in the original position, the five recorded the liaison work magical transmission, tacit cooperation, fruit for the general fans familiar with, I do not need to tell you. Another lineup can be: Zhang Banglun, Li Yichen, Zhuang Youren, Zhu Lingsheng, Jing Fuzhen, Zhang Lin, Gen Li, Yao Sun, Jinshun, Mai Youliang.

The first reason for this lineup is that Zhuang Youren's recent performance has improved greatly and his strength is also sufficient, so he should be reused, and he and Lin Gen can echo each other and take care of each other, without revealing flaws. The second reason is that if the first lineup is used, the left forward Liang Shutang and the left full-back Li Yichen are both from two teams, which is inevitable and unfamiliar. Moreover, Qiao Lian forwards are fierce right forwards and right wingers, so Zhu Lingsheng is replaced by Liang Shutang, since Zhu and Li are both from Lian Yi, they must know each other's playing styles, and Zhu's activity and strength are also better than Liang's. To defend against the opponent's right-hand side, reduce its offensive, should be a reasonable strategy, to the forward line, it has been said above that there is no need to change.

Looking at the above two lineups, it can be called the most standard candidates in the Hua team. That is more than the Chinese team in this International Cup. Fu Hua authorities, have this perseverance, so that the football season is about to pass has this most fascinating grand competition, commotion the fans, is worthy of praise.

Various Ceremonies Have Been Drawn Up: In order to make the ceremony more grand, the ceremony has also been considered, and it was decided to ask Wu Yunqi to hold the opening ceremony, and Liu Qiong was appointed to give the awards. Other prizes such as expensive, and used as the highest quality of leather and the ball, all for several years of the best goods on the glue, can be called the recent game in rare.

### An Overview of the Top Five Football Teams

— Sisi

This season's football league has come to an end, and the general trend has been set. Only the replay between Portuguese Merchants and Lianyi is more controversial. Looking at the operations of the season, at this end, it may be useful to give a brief discussion on the top five teams, regardless of front and back, writing by hand.

Dong Hua

The prestige of the previous session, unparalleled. The football world was shocked and unanimously praised. At the beginning of this session, we were very careful and had unlimited expectations, and we also believed that it could continue to work hard. I hope that the team will fail to practice due to various reasons, which led to a big defeat when meeting Portuguese merchants. As a result, the morale was sharply reduced, and the failure to Qiu Wendu was a big surprise. Until the most disappointing battle, the battle with Qiao Lian, he tried his best to recover his reputation, and the result was still unsuccessful. But its soil gas, is indeed more prosperous than the beginning of the season. Overall, the various aspects of the team will not be much degraded due to the interval of a season, so the failure is entirely in the air. Li Ningliang Shutang Dai Linjingsun The previous session often practiced more and had the appearance of rejuvenation. On the contrary, this session due to lack of practice, and the father has more powerless old state, this is really the only regret of the wood session, but Yu on the team's spiritual aspects, that is satisfactory, it can attract a large number of viewers, that is the beacon.

Lian Yi

At the beginning of joining this league, there are generals such as Luo Shoujia, and the generals joined in unison. Lian Yi, who has always been a desolate general, has such candidates, so it is also visible. Indeed, at the beginning of the division, the whole force was awe-inspiring, and it had the feeling that I was the only one in the world this year. Unexpectedly, in the middle, both He Degao and Shanghai police tied. As a result, a courage, suffered a setback. The battle for the Portuguese merchants, made an unhappy ending. Now although there is a chance to replay, but Ru Qu Shui Fu Wu Qixiang's being deleted, the loss of the large, scheduling fruit still has a square, relatively speaking, it is inevitable that the relatively inferior. Therefore, the day of the replay, it seems that I dare not expect to have much harvest, I am afraid it will also become a person of covering the meaning of intention. But if Yu Lianyi soldiers' ball skills, such as can have its concentration camp spirit this season indomitable, the future is bright this brilliant, I hope the team can do so.

Portuguese Merchants

The team will have the absolute hope of winning the championship of this league. The reason why it can get this good fruit, first of all, is to get the help of Fu En W Pantuo Xun Ke Laituo, and Bao Xituo's debut, so the morale increased greatly. The reason why the Portuguese merchants have been paying attention to the league does not pay attention to the league, this sudden change is also a mystery. The team has indeed had several successful performances in this session, Bao Xituo's temptation to turn the ball, Fu En's speed, and Aolie Wiera's awe-inspiring, are all praised by fans. After that, the team also has a game against Lianyi's Bu Sa, which is expected to be solved easily and complete the results.

Qiao Lian

It is inevitable to have some regrets for not winning the chief seat with Qiao Lian's first place in the seat. The most significant thing is that the battle with the German merchants, due to misunderstanding of the failure to attend, was sentenced to abandon the right, the loss of a game, otherwise only lost to Lianyi a record of the game, there is a great possibility to climb the throne, at least with the Portuguese merchants to stand on an equal footing. But also the same team has won the championship of the Mayor's Cup, the Italian team represented by the team Tsing Yi, also won the International Cup finals, although the loss of a league championship, such as the ability to win the two titles, when can comfort, not to bear its heart. The recent situation of Jia, International Cup overwhelmed the Nordic, is extremely certain, if not lost in the league, then the package of three championships, Lei has the last Xiongfeng on behalf of Donghua.

Shanghai Police

In terms of the candidates for the Shanghai police, it should be listed as one of the strong teams, but the initial results of the league were greatly disappointed. The reason for the failure is that there is no novelty of tactics, no cover mode, with the later, the end of tacit understanding, in order to have one or two new will personally improve the leadership and self. More only battle, into the Guhou in several cities, can suddenly be able to win the absolute right, although barely self-consolation? But also enough to comfort himself? It is reported that the team due to the majority of players, left Shanghai after the Mayor's Cup finals, the football team also disintegrate it, it is inevitable to make people feel narrative scattered, "Shanghai police" two words are also on the verge of becoming a team in football history

### The Last Scene of the Basketball Charity Match: The Key to Hua Lian's Defeat

The first and second battles of the basketball charity match hosted by Hua Lian Pharmaceutical Factory have been described in the previous issue. The last scene was played last Saturday at the Qingnianhui Gym in the Xianqiao Bridge. Hua Lian faced the Giants team. I gave Hua Lian unlimited expectations, but the result of the "war, Hua Lian was still defeated. The reporter carefully observed the battle, and the reasons for the failure should be:

Zhenzhong Absence

Hua Lian strengthened its strength, and special borrowing from the Shantou team and Zhongbei, but the second war, Huo Zhong did not arrive, so the author had made a sincere statement hoping that Zhenzhong would attend in the last issue. It is said that Zhenzhong does have the ability to command and transport the whole team, but I do not know why, in the last war, Zhenzhong still did not see the car, which in the rest of the team's morale aspects, not without shadow. And because the team members came from several teams, it is true that a central figure like Zhenzhong is missing.

Improper Deployment

Hua Lian's application of Chen Xuechong, Zhang Yiliang Xiong, Xu Jusheng, Zhuo Guorong Ma Canxi five people to fight, is very desirable, halfway through the sudden to Bao Songyuan Zhang Jinxuan transferred, is not appropriate. It is said that the situation of each warring is in the normal, how to casually deploy people, and the team members are not the same team, add more transfers, definitely not the best policy.

Lack of Breaking the Enemy The performance of the giants this time is not ideal, roughly also for the reason of long-term lack of practice. Regardless of its offensive and defensive stagnation in the too formulaic type, especially in the offensive when the fixed position, for the sake of unnecessary consumption of transmission, to induce the enemy, resulting in gaps and into the Hua Lian such as the reason, should be forced, not without success, Nai not this picture also! The giants guard the time of stay, is even more than the attack, then Hua Lian, such as the rapid and agile transmission, the basket from more. To sum up, the reason why Hua Lian is so, or to the loss of cooperation aspects.

In summary, with the Hua Lian out of the field candidates to talk about, should be able to win the giants, and finally defeated, no more to say. The Shanghai indoor competition, after that, due to the relationship between the field, can not see again, will be this battle as the last of a curtain, and Hua Lian's failure to defeat the giants, can not without regret.

Finally, for the Hua Lian Pharmaceutical Factory, the host Zhang Yuxiang's enthusiasm for running, the players' arrival and the fans' enthusiastic weaving, should be thanked on behalf of the Nanshi International Relief Hospital and Limin Hospital, and the blessing of the indirect patients. The football world has this charity move, is a good deed (Sound)

### Talking About Badminton (II)

— Kang

In short, if a person can shed a lot of yellow sweat every day, then the body temperature must be kept on the balance line, and there will never be too high or too low body temperature. Because the substances in the sweat have been excreted, it will not harm the blood cells, diabetes. Jaundice is that the sweat contains impurities, and does not pay attention to the Ming set of transport to the skin respiratory organs, and red sweat, is that the sweat contains blood quality.

Using drugs to stimulate the sweat nerves, is not as good as moving the body, ask to use the sweat nerves and sweat well, you must know that the stimulation of drugs, is forced to use, does not fit the natural laws. The stimulation of drug sweat nerves, although it is beneficial to sweating, may not be harmless to other functions. But exercise and sweating, is beneficial and harmless.

Obese people, not only the body is not lively, not beautiful. And to the summer season, than not obese people, particularly can not stand the heat of the climate. Probably too much fat in the body, the body temperature is hotter, so Xu Fei people, more in the summer feel very uncomfortable, however, try to mold the skin of obese people, indeed it is very cool. This is because fatty acids can not fully emit outward.

If an obese person can often exercise this kind of ball game; then when playing the ball, to quickly hit the ball, hurry to run, the whole mind of attention. Psychological, physiological, while playing a great role. So a lot of sweating, the body of fatty acids, as much as possible to evaporate out, you can gradually reduce the excess fat, so that the body will not be very obese, and become a very suitable body. And the long-term movement, the muscles of all parts of the body, gradually solid, fat to, and muscle beauty, can become a beautiful body. Obese young men and women, there is great benefit, try it, when you know the benefits are not shallow.

Promote the Amount of Respiratory Volume

No matter who, once a fierce exercise, the cells of each part, immediately play a burning role, then the amount of lung respiration will certainly greatly increase. Since the amount of respiration has increased, then the unclean air in the lungs, and fresh air will be rapidly interchanged. The blood naturally clean, and the lung trachea, due to the vibration is very urgent, it will shrink very fast, so the lung cells will also be strong. The muscles of the chest, due to the amount of lung respiration, gradually developed. Chest muscles gradually beautiful, lung strong, lung disease where will occur? So this movement, for women, there is a special benefit. Moreover, most of the women in our country have underdeveloped chest and insufficient lung capacity, and they are prone to lung disease, but this kind of exercise does have extraordinary benefits. Because we often have to connect the high ball, the body will have to look up to the sky after the party, the chest is therefore expanded, is very beneficial. More than playing volleyball much better. Only people who have the second stage of lung disease, you can not exercise, you must wait until the disease is better, before you can play this ball game.

Exercise the Muscles of the Whole Body

This game, in addition to special development of the chest, can also develop the muscles of the whole body. Running, jumping, beneficial in the lower limbs. Left and right side strikes are beneficial to the waist. Saving dangerous balls, or net front balls, etc., are beneficial to the abdomen. As for the upper limbs, and the lower limbs, there is more direct bravery, so the pity, is only one arm holds the fear, the other arm can not be evenly developed ear.

This game, the ball comes quickly, to shoot the ball, very good, that is the whole experience, as well as the eyes of the measuring power. But to the eyes sharp, also the whole practice of using the eyes, more practice the line of sight. Because the hand can not be right, if the hand can not be in line with the heart, or the brain nerve sympathetic sluggish, you can not play the ball well. I often see many beginners, eyes and hands, do not correspond to the use, this is to practice muscles and tendons, less practice movement and the brain.

### A Description of Basketball Theory (XVI)

IV. Modern Defensive Methods

Modern defensive methods include so-called "man-to-man," five-person zone defense, and "man-to-man" and zone defense mixed defense, etc., but the former two are the most popular. The following is a summary of the two:

(A) "Man-to-Man" Defensive Method

The meaning of the "man-to-man" defensive method is that one member of our team guards one member of the opposing team. The use of it can vary according to the size of the court, the actual strength of the two players, the length of time in the game, and the opponent's offensive method. In general, the most common types are as follows: The members of our team guard the opposing members with equal physical strength. The forward guards the opponent's defender, the center guards the opponent's center, and the defender guards the opponent's forward. After our team loses the ball, the five members quickly retreat to the back court, waiting for the enemy to attack. When they cross the center line, each person identifies and guards one person nearby. While the four people each guard the person nearby, one person is responsible for strictly guarding the enemy rushing into the basket. The former two are suitable for smaller venues, the enemy is weak and we are strong, or equal strength, both are famous teams and can not cooperate with each other, or the enemy uses a delay tactics to win the score. The latter is for the sake of saving energy and is suitable for larger venues, the enemy is strong and we are weak, and the game time is far from over.

The "man-to-man" defensive method has its strengths and weaknesses. It must be used well to be effective. The advantage is that it can be matched with the opponent's size and ability to defend it, so that each person can designate one person to be responsible for the defense, can pressure the opponent at any time, rush to attack, destroy its formation, so that it has no room to breathe, and in the game at any time and anywhere can strictly prevent the enemy's actions. However, there are many shortcomings, if the distribution is improper, the members of our team against the opposing players, the individual strength disparity, it is easy to become a loophole, the whole team is in danger. Moreover, this defensive method is easily broken by the opposing team's blocking method. Because the guards using this method, must run with the enemy full court, he steps I step, he easy I touch approaching, the body already tired and easily touch the opponent's body foul.

Therefore, in addition to the whole team's cooperative defense, personal defensive skills must also be used well to adopt the "man-to-man" defensive method. Those who use this method of defense, 着 looking at people do not look at the ball, strictly monitor the enemy that I can guard; my standing position, should always be kept between the opponent and the enemy basket, often occupy the inner circle, pressure the enemy near the sideline, so that the enemy can not run to the valley, and can not let the enemy run to the back, and give it a chance to sneak attack. The distance between the position and the opponent, depends on the skill of the opponent's height. The enemy is more sensitive than I am, should be away from it more, the enemy is more dull than I am, then it should be slightly closer, and can quickly move forward, pretending to be, so that its panic and confusion, take the opportunity to capture the ball. If the opponent does not have the ball in hand, he can let him run, and I then seek a suitable location to monitor it, do not have to follow its run, in order to save energy; if the other party holds the ball in hand, then it is not strictly prevented. The attitude of defense, is very appropriate to be calm, such as being deceived by the other side 装 , stay Wai opponent line blocking method, and must often pay attention to the opponent's eyes and footsteps, pre-guess its passing, or escape the straight line, in order to block the war and seize the ball.

(B) Five-Person Zone Defense Method

The so-called five-person zone defense method, that is, in our team's back court, divided into five areas, and one person is responsible for defending an area. The lineup can be divided into: Three in the front row, two in the back row. Two in the front row, three in the back row. Two in the front row, one in the middle row, two in the back row, etc. The former is the most common. The formation method is that as soon as our team loses the ball, the five members quickly retreat to the back court. The two defenders first retreat to the front of the enemy's basket, between the free throw line, each occupying the left and right halves of the field to defend it. The center and the two forwards retreat to the middle of the center line and the free throw line, three people in a horizontal row in the field, the two forwards each occupy the left and right wings, the center then guards the center, waiting for the other side to come to attack.

Until the enemy comes to attack, the method of defense, can also be divided into three types; One person defends one area, that is, each person is responsible for monitoring the enemy who walks into his defensive area. After the two skills, each monitor the first person rushing in from the left and right of the previous record, the front record forward, each guards the second person of the left and right sides, or the last person rushing in, the center is responsible for guarding, from the left and right guards of the third person, or the last person. To change the defensive area, echo each other's method, triple defense, that is, with the direction of the ball, transfer the lineup, so that at least three people, facing the way the ball came. The ball and divided into triple defense, so that the enemy holding the ball, is not easy to go deep into the attack.

### Sports Miscellany

The athletic teams and football teams of the Three Provinces Athletic Association, as well as the women's basketball and volleyball teams, have achieved remarkable and commendable results, and their spirit is particularly admirable. It is now learned that the association has recently established a men's volleyball team, appointing Deng Xiaoliang as manager and Zhang Rui as captain.
