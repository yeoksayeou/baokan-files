### Fierce Battles North of Shuri on Okinawa Island: Japanese Forces Launch Intense Counterattacks; Heavy Damage to American Forces Landing at Nago Bay

Tokyo, 3rd (Central News Agency dispatch) - The battle between Japanese and American forces north of Shuri on Okinawa Island is intensifying, with Japanese forces launching vigorous counterattacks. On the evening of the 10th, Japanese forces implemented a full-scale "slashing" tactic, disrupting the enemy's rear lines. The results are currently under investigation. On the morning of the 11th, the enemy forces increased their troops in front of the Japanese lines, followed by repeated attacks with tanks and armored vehicles. Japanese forces repelled these attacks each time, thwarting the enemy's offensive. The battle lines remained largely unchanged from yesterday. Furthermore, of the 5,000 American troops who landed at Nago Bay in the north, fierce Japanese fire destroyed 35 tanks, 2 armored vehicles, 5 automobiles, and 1 generator. Many soldiers were killed or wounded, and seven fuel, ammunition, and supply depots were set ablaze. Japanese losses were minimal. The two airfields in the north and central parts of the island have fallen into enemy hands. Since the afternoon of the 3rd, the enemy has attempted to use these airfields, with several small aircraft taking off. Japanese forces bombed these airfields from their main southern positions, suppressing enemy operations and currently restricting their use. Approximately two battalions of enemy troops landed on Tsuken Island. The Japanese defenders fought bravely, inflicting heavy losses on the enemy.

Central News Agency dispatch - According to reports, the battle for Mount Kazu, east of the Makiminato airfield on Okinawa Island, has remained undecided for the past two days. Japanese forces have abandoned their defensive posture. When any part of the 7,000-yard line is occupied by American forces, the Japanese will launch a counterattack to retake the position. Japanese forces from Shuri are providing reinforcements at any time, and the Japanese forces on the front line total more than a division. Additionally, between Makiminato and Waushima Town, Japanese forces have constructed extremely solid fortifications. American experts say that these fortifications are remarkably sophisticated, with a level of intensity never before seen. The Japanese forces in that area are equipped with powerful automatic weapons and are well-trained. The area around Shuri is heavily equipped with cannons, mortars, and long- and short-range artillery to defend against heavy enemy attacks. Furthermore, the Japanese use of mortar techniques is astonishing. For example, one area of the American 7th Division was hit by three mortar rounds within five minutes.

Central News Agency dispatch - According to information received here, American forces, using the 24th Corps, are attempting to attack Naha. Japanese forces north of Gashichan are bombarding the American forces in that area. According to Smith, Deputy Chief of Staff of the U.S. Tenth Army, a certain artillery unit in the Pacific is providing support to ground troops on Okinawa Island to the fullest extent possible. In the northern sector, the American forces are the 3rd Marine Regiment, supported by battleships, cruisers, and other ships. However, they have been repeatedly hindered by Japanese artillery fire and have not advanced. The American 24th Corps on the west coast is now located several miles north of Naha.

Somewhere in the Nansei Islands, 12th (Central News Agency dispatch) - On the afternoon of the 11th, from 7:00 PM to 8:00 PM, Japanese special attack units attacked enemy ships concentrated around Okinawa Island, sinking at least one cruiser. The attacks are continuing.

Somewhere in the Nansei Islands, 12th (Central News Agency dispatch) - The weather has been extremely poor for the past few days. Since the morning of the 11th, the weather in the Nansei Islands has gradually cleared, and the offensive by both sides has intensified again. On the 11th, there were five enemy battleships, 15 to 20 cruisers, 40 to 45 destroyers, 110 to 130 transport ships, and approximately 200 landing craft around Okinawa. Furthermore, to the east of Okinawa Island, an enemy mobile force with two aircraft carriers as its main force is maneuvering. To the southeast, another mobile force with three aircraft carriers as its main force is also active.

### Burmese Front: Japanese Forces Launch Attacks

Burmese Frontline Base, 12th (Central News Agency dispatch) - After enemy forces advanced to Meiktila, they are urgently trying to secure their rear supply lines. They are focusing their efforts on repairing the highways between Myingyan, Thazi, and Meiktila, and between Myingyan, Pinbin, and Meiktila. Japanese forces in that area are launching attacks at any time, seriously threatening the enemy. On the night of April 4th, a large-scale raid was carried out on enemy positions near Pinbin, achieving significant results. At the same time, enemy forces on both sides of the Arakan Mountains are urgently moving south along the Kyaukmaung-Taungup road. Japanese forces in that area are blocking the enemy near Kawsut, 10 kilometers north of Taungup, engaging them in combat.

### His Imperial Highness Prince Takamatsu Ordered to Visit the Ise Grand Shrine to Pray for Victory; Prime Minister Suzuki Urges the People to Fight to the End

Tokyo, 12th (Central News Agency dispatch) - His Imperial Majesty the Emperor, in order to pray for victory and overcome the national crisis, specially dispatched His Imperial Highness Prince Takamatsu to visit the Ise Grand Shrine as his representative. After receiving the Imperial will, His Imperial Highness, accompanied by his entourage, boarded the train that departed from Shinagawa Station at 10:24 PM on the 7th.

Our 100 million people should work together to achieve the sole objective of the war, advancing and fighting to the end, to reassure the Emperor.

### Two Units of the Japanese Navy Praised for Gallantry; Fierce Fighting in Northern Luzon

Tokyo, 12th (Central News Agency dispatch) - The Japanese Navy Ministry recently announced that the 00th unit commanded by Lieutenant Commander Yukio Nishimura and the 00th unit commanded by Lieutenant Commander Hiroyasu Mizutani fought bravely in the Manila area campaign, holding their positions for several days. After being ordered to change course, they broke through the encirclement and completed their mission. They have been awarded certificates of commendation by the Commander-in-Chief of the Combined Fleet.

Luzon Frontline, 12th (Central News Agency dispatch) - On the northern Luzon front, the enemy forces facing Mount Karasak are currently reinforcing their troops. Japanese forces are desperately repelling them, and the fighting is extremely fierce. On the 6th, Japanese forces counterattacked enemy troops who had infiltrated the high ground northwest of the mountain range. By the 7th, the enemy had reinforced their troops and retaken the high ground, dividing other Japanese positions or encircling strongholds and entering gaps in the Japanese lines. Enemy forces appearing east of the mountain range are heavily bombarding Japanese positions with six to eight mortars. Japanese soldiers are carrying out suicide attacks, and fierce fighting is underway. The Japanese units in that area are fighting with all their might. Although their weapons have suffered heavy damage and ammunition is lacking, their morale is extremely high, repeatedly engaging in human-bullet attacks. In one position, a large force of 40 Japanese soldiers surrounded 700 enemy troops. Japanese reinforcements are gradually joining the front lines, and fighting continues on the mountain slopes and in the valleys.

### Damage to British Mobile Force Approaching Sumatra

Southern Base, 12th (Central News Agency dispatch) - A British mobile force approached northern Sumatra on the morning of the 12th. After being engaged by Japanese forces, it was confirmed that two enemy aircraft were shot down, and one destroyer and four carrier-based aircraft were destroyed by Japanese Army special attack units.

### B-29s Attack Tokyo and Fukushima

Tokyo, 12th (Central News Agency dispatch) - Approximately 150 enemy B-29 aircraft from Mariana bases intruded into the northwestern part of Tokyo and the Shizuoka area at around 10:00 AM on the 12th, carrying out bombing raids for about two hours. A portion of them also intruded into the Fukushima and Ibaraki areas. Japanese air defense forces fought bravely, achieving considerable results. Detailed information is still under investigation.

### Significance of Non-Extension of Japan-Soviet Neutrality Pact

Central News Agency dispatch - Soviet People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Molotov notified Japanese Ambassador Sato on April 5th that the Japan-Soviet Neutrality Pact, signed on April 13, 1941, would be terminated. This notification was based on Article 3 of the treaty, which states that the treaty (valid for a period of five years) will expire on April 25th of next year. The Soviet Union has now indicated that it does not intend to continue the treaty after its expiration. According to the treaty, if one of the two countries does not notify the other of its termination one year before the expiration date (i.e., April 25th of this year), the treaty will continue to be valid for another five years, extending it to 1951. Therefore, the Soviet notification means that they do not intend to extend the treaty from 1946 to 1951. It does not mean that the current treaty is immediately terminated. The treaty remains in effect until April 25th of next year, and this is a point that we should emphasize.

Regarding this Soviet notification, the enemy is using it as a basis for various forms of propaganda, speculating that it is related to the reorganization of the Japanese cabinet, or making arbitrary judgments about Japan-Soviet relations. All of this indicates that the enemy is deeply concerned about the progress of the war. Why do we say this? Because the purpose of the Japanese cabinet reorganization is to create a stronger cabinet. It has nothing to do with the notification of the treaty's termination. Furthermore, regarding future Japan-Soviet relations, Japan has indicated that although the Soviet Union has notified its termination, it will still make its best effort to maintain the Japan-Soviet Neutrality Pact. This is even more worthy of our attention. The new Suzuki cabinet of Japan is pursuing the same enlightened and realistic policies as the previous Koiso cabinet. Although it is impossible to foresee any sudden changes in Japan-Soviet relations today, news from Reuters indicates that the British and Americans seem to have agreed with the Soviet Union to terminate the Japan-Soviet treaty at the Crimea Conference. However, this agreement concerns a certain important region of East Asia, and they did not consult with the Chongqing government before acting on their own accord. This shows the British and American disregard for Chongqing, and also shows that there are conflicting opinions between the British and Americans. It is clear that the British and Americans are acting unreasonably in every way to win the favor of the Soviet Union. Why are the British and Americans so accommodating to the Soviet Union? It is because the war is not progressing smoothly, and they have major weaknesses within. The United States faces growing war-weariness at home as the war drags on, and labor disputes and strikes are affecting wartime production. Furthermore, the shortage of human resources has become a clear fact. The current situation in Japan should not be underestimated, but the enemy's difficulties are increasing as the war progresses. Whenever concrete problems arise in the enemy camp, confusion will inevitably arise, and this will allow Japan to achieve final victory in the Greater East Asia War.

### Battle of Okinawa: A Decisive Battle Within a Decisive Battle; Director Matsushima Explains the War Situation

The Allied Forces Japanese Fleet Press Department held a regular meeting yesterday afternoon. Director Matsushima, Lieutenant Matsumoto, and many newspaper reporters attended. Director Matsushima explained the war situation in the Ryukyu and Okinawa Islands, stating that the American enemy has suffered extremely heavy losses and that the battle of Okinawa is truly a decisive battle within a decisive battle, with grave implications. The main points of his speech are summarized below:

Enemy Ships in Confusion in the Ryukyus

The Anglo-American mobile forces operating in the Ryukyu Islands comprise five groups in total. Since the 5th, three of these groups have been destroyed by the fierce attacks of the Japanese Army and Navy Air Forces. The remaining two groups have suffered severe damage. A portion of them are still maneuvering around the Ryukyu Islands. As of April 9th, the Japanese side has achieved the following results: 293 enemy ships sunk or damaged, all of which are combat vessels. The damage they have suffered is extremely severe. At that time, due to cloud cover and poor weather, the Japanese fleet was only able to exert a fraction of its power, but it was still able to achieve such great results. In the past two days, the weather has improved, and the Japanese military is calmly awaiting a good opportunity to annihilate the enemy, inflicting heavy blows on them. The enemy forces are currently in a state of confusion.

Japanese Forces Hold Their Ground on Okinawa

The enemy ships that can be seen around Okinawa Island include four or five battleships, four or five cruisers, several destroyers, 50 to 60 transport ships, and 40 to 50 landing craft. The enemy forces engaged in land battles on Okinawa Island are divided into two armies: the Northern Army is the 3rd Marine Regiment, and the Southern Army is the 24th Army Corps. On the evening of the 7th, 5,000 infantrymen and 100 tanks landed near Nago. The Japanese military has dealt a heavy blow to the invading enemy, destroying half of their tanks. The enemy in this area is being heavily attacked by Japanese forces holding firm fortifications and has been plunged into a bitter struggle.

Fighting Between Both Sides is Extremely Fierce

According to enemy reports from the southern front, they are two miles from Shuri. This information is inaccurate. In reality, on the front line at the Tsuga South Line, the enemy is being attacked by Japanese forces holding firm fortifications and is panic-stricken. On the 11th, a Joint Forces officer broadcast from San Francisco, saying, "The Japanese defensive fortifications are extraordinarily solid, the most powerful and well-organized defensive fortifications in the world." At the same time, a US infantry officer said, "The artillery used by the Japanese is artillery that we have never used before." The enemy, due to the intensity of Japanese artillery fire, has moved the artillery used by the Northern Line 3rd Marine Brigade to the Southern Line to attack Japanese forces. According to the Deputy Chief of Staff of the enemy's First Army, Smith (O.P. Smith), "We are now using the most powerful artillery, and the amount of artillery used in each yard of area has reached the highest limit in the world." Although the enemy is employing such powerful artillery fire, the attack is slow and has not developed, and the damage and bloodshed they have suffered are unprecedentedly great. American journalists have also reported that from the air, they have seen stretchers carrying the dead and wounded like a surging tide. The enemy has also stated that they are using airplanes to transport the wounded and dead soldiers, so one can imagine the intensity of the fighting. During the battle to seize a 155-meter high ground, the fighting was repeated and extremely fierce, but as a result, this high ground is still controlled by the Japanese military. Therefore, the war situation in the next few days can be said to have very important significance. The enemy's mobile forces have been plunged into a bitter struggle, and land transportation and rear supply will become even more difficult in the future.

Chongqing and American Air Force Actions are Passive

Recently, the Chongqing-based American Air Force activities have been extremely passive. Only a few units have been carrying out air raids on the Yangtze River, the South China coast, and the Jinpu Line area, and the Japanese side has suffered very little damage. Recently, the Japanese military occupied Laohokou. This place is an extremely important area for the Chongqing army's activities in North and Central China. Now that it has been occupied by the Japanese military, it is a significant achievement.

The Okinawa Operation is Highly Significant

Finally, Director Matsushima explained the significance of the enemy's operation against Okinawa Island as follows: The enemy's operation against Okinawa Island, like the operation against Iwo Jima, hopes to build an airfield in an area close to the Japanese mainland. If this battle is successful, the enemy plans to use this island and Iwo Jima simultaneously as their air force bases to launch more violent bombings against the Japanese mainland and further attacks against the Chinese mainland and areas close to the Japanese mainland. Now the Japanese military has resolved to annihilate the enemy here and fight strongly. If the Japanese military can inflict a thorough blow on the enemy, it will inevitably create a new stage in the Greater East Asia War. Therefore, we dare to say that the operation of Okinawa Island is truly a decisive battle in the decisive battle. In this battle, the Japanese military has dealt an extremely serious blow to the enemy and achieved brilliant results, which is a prelude to the path to victory in future operations, and its significance is very important.

British Ships Participating Suffered Heavy Damage

It is not clear how many British battleships participated in the Okinawa Island operation, but the "George V" and "Illustrious" were both participating in the operation, and the enemy also admitted that the "George V" and other ships suffered damage. In other words, the British flagship suffered extremely serious damage.

Editorial

### Japan-Soviet Neutral Relations and Their Future

On the 5th of this month, the Soviet Union notified Japan that the Japan-Soviet Neutrality Pact will not be extended after its expiration next April. Discussing Japan-Soviet relations is extremely complex. Within six months of the establishment of the Japan-Soviet Neutrality Pact, the international situation changed rapidly, especially with the outbreak of the German-Soviet War, the establishment of the Anglo-American-Soviet alliance, and Japan's declaration of war on Britain and the United States. However, the spirit of the Japan-Soviet Neutrality Pact remained unshaken. In particular, on March 30 of last year, the signing of the Japan-Soviet Fisheries Treaty for another five years and the two protocols on the transfer of rights and interests in northern Sakhalin further stabilized the neutral relations between Japan and the Soviet Union, and dealt a major blow to the enemy's propaganda and scheming in politics.

Now that the Soviet Union has announced the termination of the treaty, it is based on Article 3 of the treaty: "This treaty shall enter into force on the date of ratification by both contracting parties (according to the ratification date is April 25, 1941), and shall remain in effect for a period of five years. If either of the two contracting parties does not notify the other of its termination one year before the expiration of the aforementioned period, this treaty will automatically continue for another five years." Therefore, firstly, this time the Soviet Union's notification of termination is an ordinary diplomatic act in accordance with the provisions of the treaty and is not surprising; secondly, although the Soviet Union has notified the termination of the treaty, it still has one year of validity and is not terminated immediately; thirdly, the changes in the international situation in the next year will certainly be beyond what can be imagined today. Under the actual needs between Japan and the Soviet Union, it is not impossible to conclude a friendly treaty separately in the future.

Secondly, it has been a week since the Soviet Union announced the termination of the treaty, and public opinion on both sides has been calm as usual. Therefore, the enemy, Britain and the United States, apart from pointing out that this move "has significant political significance," cannot exaggerate too much. The situation is completely different from the situation when the relations between Germany and the Soviet Union changed, which shows that there will definitely not be a major change in Japan-Soviet relations. At the same time, the new Japanese Foreign Minister, Mr. Togo, served as the ambassador to the Soviet Union in 1939. Regarding the then extremely dangerous Japan-Soviet relations, he used the Nomonhan Incident as the center and negotiated with Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov to open up the way for Japan-Soviet diplomatic relations, paving the way for Matsuoka and Molotov to sign the neutrality treaty. Now that he is reappointed as Foreign Minister, he will definitely be able to display his talents and contribute to Japan-Soviet friendship.

Moreover, the Soviet Union has been fighting hard for nearly four years, and its national power has been greatly depleted. Regardless of how the European War will progress in the future, it is, in fact, absolutely impossible to bet the country on one chance, to fall for the trick of British and American imperialists. This can be understood by anyone who knows a little about Soviet history and national policy. Today's notification of termination is nothing more than exchanging a check one year later for actual rights in the upcoming San Francisco Conference.

### Japanese Army Coordinates Operations: Occupies Nanyang City; American Air Force Retreats from Northwest Base

Henan Frontline, 12th (Central News Agency dispatch) - After the Japanese army units completed the encirclement of Nanyang, a key point of the Fifth War Area, they began a general attack on the morning of March 30th, coordinating with the fierce artillery fire of friendly forces, gradually approaching Nanyang's northern and enemy fortifications. The vanguard of the Japanese army, which occupied the outer city that evening, entered the city from the west at zero hours on the 31st. The follow-up troops broke through the main gate at 4:20 AM, and other friendly troops also carried out night raids by moonlight, suppressing the resistance of the enemy in the north and west, and killing their way into the city. From 9:00 AM, they began to mop up the remaining enemy troops in the city and completely occupied it by noon. It has been investigated that since last autumn, the enemy has actively defended Nanyang, dispatching the 43rd Division, the most elite unit of the 68th Army, to take charge of the defense, and deploying a large number of field and mountain artillery to attempt a stubborn defense. On the 24th, they ordered the residents within five kilometers around Nanyang to evacuate. Before the Japanese army launched a general attack, they had suffered considerable damage due to Japanese artillery fire and bombing, but they sternly rejected the Japanese army's surrender and were determined to defend Nanyang to the death. However, after the Japanese army began its general attack, it was occupied by the Japanese army in just one night.

Counter-Offensive Strategy on the Mainland Suffers Setback

Mainland Base, 11th (Central News Agency dispatch) - After the Japanese army occupied Laohokou, the Northwest forward base of the US Air Force stationed in Chongqing, on the 11th, the enemy's strategic movements were completely shattered, and the strategic attempt of the US-Chongqing joint army to launch a general counter-offensive against Japan was also frustrated. The US Air Force stationed in Chongqing previously lost the Guilin base while fighting in Hunan and Guangxi provinces. After the Suiyuan base was occupied in January, the only forward base it relied on was to seek it in the northwest. Therefore, it was still quite diligent in rebuilding and strengthening the engineering. The Ankang, Wenzhou, and Liangshan Northwest bases are all located in the rear, and Laohokou's position as a forward base is becoming more and more important. The enemy then mobilized a part of the tank force from Chengdu or Kunming, and dispatched P41 and P40 fighter planes from time to time to attack Nanjing, Shanghai and other cities, attack railway facilities such as the Pinghan Line and the Jinpu Line, or attack ships on the Yangtze River, attempting to cut off the Japanese side's supply lines. After being heavily attacked and annihilated by the Japanese army this time, its sphere of attack has retreated 200 to 300 kilometers towards Xi'an and Hanzhong. Its ambition to disrupt the rear from the Northwest base has been frustrated. At the same time, the US Air Force's plan to attack Japan has to be changed. This will also have a serious impact on the US-Chongqing joint military's general counter-offensive against Japan on the mainland.

### Central Executive Committee - 100th Meeting

Nanjing, 12th (Central News Agency dispatch) - The Kuomintang of China held its 100th Standing Committee meeting on the 12th, resolving several important cases, which are recorded below:

### Spain Severs Relations with Japan

Lisbon, 11th (Central News Agency dispatch) - According to a dispatch from Madrid, the Spanish government announced on the 11th that it had severed diplomatic relations with Japan. On that day, General Franco ordered the Political Committee of the Spanish Nationalist Party's highest organ to approve the government's policy toward Japan, and then convened a cabinet meeting to announce this momentous decision.

### Minister Zhao’s Remarks

Nanjing, 12th (Central News Agency dispatch) - Minister of Propaganda Zhao, speaking to visiting reporters, said: "Freedom of speech is a right that the people should enjoy and is a policy promoted by the government. The resolutions of the People's Representative Conference are of great concern to the government and are always given attention. As for guidance theories, this is another matter. Since there is an established national policy to follow, the so-called guidance work is merely a technical issue of implementing national policy. The ministry has always fulfilled its responsibilities in a timely manner."

### Japanese Ship "Awa Maru" Attacked and Sunk

Lisbon, 11th (Central News Agency dispatch) - According to a dispatch from Washington, the US State Department announced on the 11th: The Navy Department has informed the State Department that a submarine sank a ship in the East China Sea on April 17th. The ship sank after being attacked. One crew member was rescued, who claimed that the ship was the "Awa Maru." Regarding the above matter, the US government is currently in communication with the Swiss government, which has informed the Japanese government. According to investigations, the ship, which had been guaranteed safe passage by the US government, was carrying relief supplies to American prisoners of war and detained Americans in the South Seas and disappeared on its way home. The last known location of the ship was in the southern part of the East China Sea.

### Mr. Koiso Appointed Minister of Transport

Tokyo, 12th (Central News Agency dispatch) - When Prime Minister Suzuki formed his cabinet on the 7th, he appointed Minister of Military Supplies Toyota to concurrently serve as Minister of Transport. However, the Prime Minister had urgently telegraphed Mr. Koiso, the former president of the South Manchuria Railway Company, to serve as the dedicated Minister of Transport. Mr. Koiso accepted the invitation and arrived in Tokyo on the morning of the 11th, visiting Prime Minister Suzuki at his residence. After holding important talks, he accepted the cabinet position. Prime Minister Suzuki immediately presented the appointment to the Emperor at 10:30 am, and the investiture ceremony was held at 2:00 pm. At the same time, the Information Bureau officially announced that Koiso would be appointed Minister of Transport, and Toyota would be relieved of his concurrent post as Minister of Transport.

### Berlin Threatened from East and West / Vienna Battles Enter Final Stage

Lisbon, 12th (Central News Agency dispatch) - European War Situation:

Western Front: According to front-line reports, the American troops who reached the Elbe River on the night of the 11th belonged to the Ninth Army. The vanguard reportedly reached the Wilmersdorf area, 13 kilometers north of Magdeburg. Near this area, five kilometers to the south, is a highway that leads directly to Berlin. On the Eastern Front, Soviet troops reached the Küstrin area, only 60 kilometers east of Berlin. With fierce attacks from both east and west, Berlin is under serious threat. The American First Army east of Göttingen, south of the Harz Mountains, crossed Nördehölen and advanced east towards the city, preparing for the battle to capture Mellinghausen. The right wing of the American First Army advancing east from the north of Göttingen joined forces with the Third Army, reaching Koldra, 27 kilometers northeast of Offatt, on the 11th. This location is only 80 kilometers from Leipzig. The American Third Army to the south occupied Coburg. Essen, the central hub of the Ruhr region, appeared to be under the control of the American forces on the 11th.

Eastern Front: The street battles in Vienna have entered their final stage. Currently, the front line in the city is inside the Danube Canal. According to front-line reports, Soviet General Tolbukhin's troops have seized the northwestern part of the Danube Canal and advanced to the area between the canal and the Danube River. German tank units and artillery units in the nearby mountains continue to fight bravely. Elsewhere, a mobile force of Tolbukhin's army is advancing west of Vienna, launching a major offensive with the aim of encircling the Wawa River, 60 kilometers west of Vienna. In addition, Malinovsky's army broke through the northwestern border of Slovakia and crossed the central Moravian Plain from several heights in Hodolin on the 11th.

### Police Bureau Clears Gambling Dens and Uncovers Another Gambling Den / More Than 30 Gamblers Investigated According to Law

The city police bureau has ordered all branch bureaus to step up investigations to thoroughly eradicate gambling. It is reported that the investigation section of the bureau's third division recently received a tip-off that Chen was running a professional gambling business at Gao Derong's home at No. 34, Lane 24, South Important Road, profiting from commissions. This was illegal. Section Chief Liu Shaokui sent detective Chen Jinsheng to cooperate with officers to surround the premises at 11:30 am on the 10th, arresting more than 30 gamblers and confiscating gambling equipment such as dice cups. They were taken to the bureau for detention. After verification, they will be transferred to the District Prosecutor's Office for investigation according to law.

### Change of Titles for Detectives and Investigators

Since the appointment of Director Zhou, the city police bureau has been determined to rectify and refresh the organization, reorganize personnel, and establish staffing. Recently, considering that the bureau's original titles of detective, investigator, and agent were inconsistent with central government regulations, it has issued an order to abolish them all and change them to Patrol Officer, Sergeant, and Constable, respectively. They are still allowed to wear plain clothes to show distinction.

### A Glimpse of Taixing

— Huang Yi

### Political and Economic Center of Northern Jiangsu

Taixing, formerly known as Taizhou, has long been the cultural and commercial center of northern Jiangsu. Han Guojun, who twice presided over the Jiangsu provincial government, was from Hai'an Town in this system. The current Minister of Secretarial Affairs of the Nanjing Control Yuan, Xia Qicen, is also a well-known figure from this system. Before the Incident, agricultural products from Dongtai, Rugao, Xiyi, and Funing were all distributed through Taixing, and goods shipped from Shanghai to northern Jiangsu were mostly unloaded at the port town of Ditang in Taixing before being transported to Taixing and distributed to various places. Ditang is only 36 li from Taixing and has well-developed transportation such as cars and rickshaws. Waterways are also very convenient. In the past, there were regular shuttle services to Zhenjiang, Yangzhou, Rugao, Gaoyou, Xinghua, Dongtai, Yancheng, and Hai'an, so there were as many as forty or fifty lodging businesses, a rare phenomenon in northern Jiangsu.

After the Incident, Taixing, as a non-military area, not only did not suffer from war, but also became more and more abnormally prosperous due to the prolonged war. There are probably reasons for this: First, neighboring areas such as Dongtai and Funing had suffered the misery of war, and the people could not bear the harassment of stray troops and bandits, so they left their homes and villages to seek refuge in Taixing. Second, Li Changjiang, the former commander-in-chief of the First Army Group, participated in the peace movement in Taixing and was not disturbed by the seven villages. The refugees regarded Taixing as a glorious land and did not want to return to their hometowns. Third, the former Northern Jiangsu Headquarters and the current Headquarters of the Second War Area are both located in this system. Officials come and go, and military and civilian personnel gather here, making Taixing tend to become the political center of northern Jiangsu. Combining these three factors, coupled with the past commercial prosperity and the special development since the Incident, Taixing has become the only capital of northern Jiangsu today!

### Transportation between Zhenjiang and Taixing and the Journey Along the Way

The reporter went to Taixing this time via Zhenjiang. From Zhenjiang to Taixing, one could first take a small sedan to Ditang and then take a car to Taixing. However, because small sedans were out of service, I changed to cross the river to Liuwei in Yangzhou. Fortunately, I had the kindness of Secretary Pan of the Zhenjiang Huang system, who sent a police escort, so I was spared the trouble of inspection when I passed the checkpoints on the riverbank. After about a quarter of an hour by wheel, I arrived at Liuwei. Then I took a small charcoal car to Taixing. The car could hold eight people and cost a total of 140,000 yuan. If one rides alone, it costs about 20,000 yuan. The car departed from Liuwei at 9 am and arrived at Yiling Town after about three hours. After crossing a single bridge, passengers got out of the car and walked. There was a Japanese garrison stationed next to the bridge. Suddenly, two policemen in black uniforms came and claimed to be inspecting, but in reality, they were asking for tips, pretending to be under the orders of the Japanese master. They were very fierce in their attitude. The car passengers had no choice but to give them each a hundred-yuan bill before they left grudgingly.

After the car passed Yiling, it suddenly broke down in the middle of the road and waited for repairs. I then talked with the passengers in the car. Half of the passengers were Taixing merchants. They said that the breakdown point was Pengjiazhuang, which belongs to Taixing, formerly Zhangjiazhuang, more than ten li from the city of Taixing. The Peng and Zhang villages are very wealthy, living in clans. One wealthy household in the Peng surname has 5,000 mu of land, and one wealthy household in the Zhang surname has 20,000 mu of land. They are all big landlords. They avoided Shanghai because they could not bear the exploitation of heavy taxes and the harassment of the New Fourth Army. They also said that last year today, this place was where the New Fourth Army frequented, often lurking on both sides of the road, looting passing travelers. Sufferers were heard of every day, and the commander of the stationed army, nicknamed King Tiger, did not have strict discipline, so the people dared to be angry but dared not speak out. Now, the army **师熊团** has moved to this area. The military discipline is very good, and the fortifications are strong, so the journey is still safe.

The car was repaired and then continued forward, arriving at the Mingjiang Road station in Taixing at 3 pm. A law enforcement team from the military police supervision office came to inspect. After showing them the reporter's business card, they were released. Then suddenly, an inspector from the **税务局** saw that the reporter had a lot of luggage and insisted on opening it for inspection. His attitude was also extremely fierce, and he regarded me as an ordinary merchant. I showed him the business card but he didn't pay attention. So I showed him my official certificate and he finally let go. As the ancients said: "A harsh government is fiercer than a tiger." Now I know that the ferocity of tax collectors is also fiercer than a tiger.

### Heavy Taxes, Difficult Business, and Suffering People's Livelihood

The busiest area in Taixing is North Gate Street, the commercial center. Its prosperity does not reduce the suffering. However, there are a few shops with tightly closed doors, with red paper strips pasted on them, inscribed with the words "This shop is being cleared and temporarily closed." The reason for this is that the tax burden is too heavy, so they have to apply for closure. This is also a slightly sluggish phenomenon in the midst of prosperity. Each shop here has business tax, income tax, and wartime consumption special tax. In addition, they also have to pay military and political expenses levied according to a percentage. With such heavy taxes, merchants and people have no way to survive. There are as many as a hundred collectors, who go to each shop every day to check accounts to prevent tax evasion. Even charcoal carriers have to pay fifteen out of every hundred. The meticulousness can be imagined.

The prices here, except for rice, which is 33,000 to 34,000 yuan per stone, which is lower than in other places, are all high. A middle-class family of five has to spend 70,000 to 80,000 yuan a day. The household donation and field donation allocated according to the Baojia system are also determined by the amount of family property. In addition, the monthly tax payment often increases with the increase in prices, without end. Therefore, everyone can never fix their budget, and there is a general sense of insecurity! The only impression I got from this trip is that the people's livelihood in northern Jiangsu is extremely difficult. The former middle class has become poor, and the general public is suffering from the heavy pressure of life, and there is a possibility of taking risks at any time. As for the local just gentry, they often avoid suspicion and withdraw, or close their doors and live in seclusion, so that traitors run rampant, seizing the opportunity to rise, and good people sigh helplessly. If this continues, it is also a crisis in northern Jiangsu society. I hope the authorities will pay close attention.

### Municipal Construction Bureau Formulates Provisional Measures for Registration of Well-Digging Merchants

3. The well-digging merchant should correct the deficiencies as listed within five days after receiving the unqualified notice.

4. The well-digging merchant should pay a security deposit to the bureau (the amount of which is calculated at 2% of the capital, but the minimum should not be less than 5,000 yuan) and receive a business license with the receipt, and also pay a license fee of 800 yuan.
