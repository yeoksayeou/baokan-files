### Fully Support a Sound National Movement, Determined to Defend Vietnam: Announcement by the Japanese Military Command in Vietnam

Tokyo, 13th (Central News Agency) – The Japanese Military Command in Vietnam issued an announcement on the evening of the 2nd, stating its determination to complete the task of solidifying the defense of Vietnam, and clarifying that it has no intention of making any changes to the native government. Key points of the announcement are as follows:

This measure is due to the French government in Vietnam failing to fulfill its duty to jointly defend Vietnam. The stationed army is determined to jointly accomplish the task of defending Vietnam with the native government. There will be no changes to the native government, and existing laws and ordinances will be respected. Regardless of whether they are French, Annamese, or from any other country, those who cooperate with the Japanese army will continue their previous tasks. Based on the Greater East Asia Declaration, support will be given to sound national movements. As the announcement shows, the Annam Kingdom, the Kingdom of Champasak, and the Kingdom of Luang Prabang will all maintain their current governments. Furthermore, the handling of Cochinchina and Tonkin will be announced successively. However, the French political organizations will remain largely unchanged, with the Cochinchina government and the Tonkin government continuing to exercise their administration independently.

The Viet Minh Declaration Closely Cooperates with Japan

Hanoi, 23rd (Central News Agency) – The Greater Vietnam National Alliance, in gratitude for Emperor Bảo Đại's declaration of independence for the Kingdom of Annam, issued the following statement on the 12th: "We, the Annamese people, who have been groaning under the oppression of white imperialism by France, have established the foundation of an independent Annam with the support of the Japanese Empire. Furthermore, on the 10th, the Japanese government made a statement that it would spare no effort in fully supporting the independence of the Annamese people. Our 25 million compatriots are deeply grateful for this. We, the Annamese people, are determined to cooperate with the Japanese Empire and contribute all our strength to the construction of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere."

### Vietnamese People Unite, Strive for Victory - General Matsui Issues Statement

Tokyo, 13th (Central News Agency) – The Japanese government has resolutely excluded the treacherous behavior of the Vietnamese authorities and taken independent defense measures. Recently, General Iwane Matsui, head of the Asia Development Headquarters of the Imperial Rule Assistance Association, issued the following statement on the 12th on this point: "The long-held aspiration of the Vietnamese people for independence has finally been achieved after decades. The Asia Development Headquarters, representing the national movement organizations of our country, with the aim of revitalizing Asia, expresses its heartfelt congratulations on this. However, the great task of nation-building cannot be easily accomplished; it cannot be realized without experiencing great difficulties. It is expected that Vietnamese territory will be ravaged by enemy Anglo-American flames of war, threatening the safety of the people's livelihood. We must never again entrust the prosperity of Asia to their evil hands. We expect the Vietnamese people to rise up bravely at this moment, drive back the enemy, and work hard to enhance their combat power. Our one hundred million Japanese people firmly believe that spiritual power surpasses material power and are continuing a bloody battle day and night to destroy the Anglo-American ambition to invade Asia. We also believe that the Vietnamese people, who have the same spirit of bloody battle as other Asian peoples, will not only maintain their glorious past history but also become a member of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere and continue to rise up to pass on the honor of independence gained through bloody struggle to their descendants. Dear people of Vietnam! Our two nations will become more unified and move towards a common goal, fighting to the end to win the final victory."

### Feelings Expressed by Annam Independence Fighters

Saigon, 13th (Central News Agency) – After Annam abolished the French-Annam Protectorate Treaty, the reporter specially interviewed the Annam people. According to Mr. Hồ Nguyễn Tân, an Annam independence fighter who had been in hiding for a long time, expressed the following feelings on the 11th: "The past eighty years have been long and painful for us Annamese people. Due to the suppression by the French constitution, most of my friends were tragically shot or starved to death in prison. However, there are still a few people remaining in the prison on Poulo Condore Island. The independence and liberation that could not be achieved with the blood of tens of millions of people has suddenly arrived, which truly makes me feel lost. We must take this opportunity to unify the country. For the Annam of the Annamese, we must unite as one. Our country was born under war, and there may be various difficulties in life, but when we think of the bloodshed and hard work of our past comrades, we can achieve complete unity."

### Residents of Sumatra Celebrate

Editorial

### The Importance of Defending Vietnam

To secure the defense of Vietnam, Japan took necessary and decisive measures against the treacherous French side on March 9, and disarmed the Vietnamese military and police, successfully completing the task. On the 11th, Emperor Bảo Đại of the Kingdom of Vietnam, representing the 23 million people of Vietnam, declared the abolition of the Franco-Vietnamese Protectorate Treaty, restored independence, and expressed his willingness to cooperate with Japan with all his strength. This has profound significance in terms of military, political, and economic aspects in ensuring the security and integrity of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere.

From a military perspective, considering Vietnam's geographical location, it borders mainland China to the north, Thailand and Burma to the west, and the Malay Peninsula along the Gulf of Siam to the southwest. To the southeast, it is separated by sea from Borneo, and to the east, it is close to Hainan Island and the Xisha and Nansha Islands, and is only about 600 nautical miles from the Philippines. It can be said to be the throat of the eastern and western continents and islands, the chest of the Southeast Sea, and the bridge connecting mainland China and the islands of the South Seas, serving as the southern outpost for the defense of the Greater East Asia Sea and Land. Since the Japanese army completed the continental longitudinal line, Vietnam's position has become increasingly important. And when the enemy America occupied the Philippines and the enemy Britain attempted to stir up trouble in India, Burma, and the waters near Sumatra, Vietnam's situation became even more critical. But precisely during this critical period, the French officials in Vietnam were still unable to forget their traditional erroneous concept of treating Vietnam with contempt, and secretly colluded with the enemy, even plotting irregular actions. Japan's decisive measures to prevent trouble before it happens were necessary. After this, the defense of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere in the south will be further strengthened, and the enemy's conspiracies will be completely shattered.

From a political perspective, Vietnam has been subjected to French contempt for over a century. Although within the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, Japan, in order to abide by the treaty of joint Franco-Japanese defense of Vietnam, allowed the French to retain their interests in Vietnam. Now that the French officials have unilaterally abandoned the treaty and attempted to revive their complete colonial rule in Vietnam, Japan, in order to ensure the security of the entire East Asia and to thoroughly liberate the Vietnamese people, had no choice but to take decisive action. Since the 11th, Vietnam has declared independence with the support of the Japanese army. From then on, the nations of the South Seas, from Thailand onwards, the Philippines, Burma, and Vietnam have successively achieved independence, and Malaya, Sumatra, Java, etc., will soon achieve independence and autonomy. Obviously, the independence of Vietnam will further promote the consolidated unity of East Asian nations, cooperate in combat, and destroy the common enemy.

From an economic perspective, Vietnam is a well-known rice-producing region and also a place rich in coal, known as a land of "both black and white riches." Its rice production ranks fourth in the world, after China, Japan, and India, with an annual output of about seven million tons. The coal production in the past was about 2.5 million tons per year, and after Japanese cooperation in development, it can be increased significantly. It also has abundant buried resources, and the quality of its anthracite coal is the best in the world. In addition, Vietnam is also rich in agricultural products such as rubber, corn, tobacco, tea, coconuts, and timber. Various resources are naturally endowed, and most of them have not yet been developed, earning it the name "unpolished pearl." Therefore, protecting Vietnam, a source that never runs dry, is clearly very important in terms of East Asia's national defense economy.

The nations of East Asia, in order to ensure the security of the East Asia family and to thoroughly strive for their own freedom, will inevitably support Japan's new measures in Vietnam and congratulate Vietnam on its independence.

### Japanese Troops in Zamboanga Launch Valiant Air Attacks; Fierce Battles Still Raging at Various Strongholds in Luzon

A certain base of the Japanese Southern Front Army, 13th (Central News Agency) – Enemy forces in Zamboanga, at the southwestern tip of Mindanao Island, have continued to attack recently. Under the cover of naval gunfire and aircraft, they invaded the Japanese airfield. The Japanese first-line brigade launched a valiant surprise attack on the 11th with fierce artillery fire throughout the day, setting fire to the enemy's material accumulation points, killing and wounding hundreds of enemy soldiers, and causing great chaos in the enemy阵营.

Luzon, 13th (Central News Agency) – The enemy's offensive against the Japanese strongholds east of Manila has gradually intensified, focusing on the northeast of Manila, east of Montalban, and west of Antipolo. The enemy has launched fierce battles in the vicinity of Antipolo for several days. The enemy is currently continuing to reinforce its forces at the south of Antipolo, the shores of Laguna de Bay, Morong, etc., using land transportation and lake boats from Clark Air Base, and repeatedly launching fierce attacks. The enemy's air raids are also extremely fierce, with up to 300 aircraft attacking various Japanese strongholds on this one day. The Japanese forces on the side all fired with guns and cannons. From the Japanese positions there, the remaining Japanese soldiers on Corregidor Island can be seen continuing to fight valiantly. The spirit of the Japanese soldiers, who have been fighting fiercely for three weeks and killing a hundred enemies with one blow, is deeply respected.

Ito's Close Combat Unit Achieves Miraculous Feats

Tokyo, 23rd (Central News Agency) – The Ito Close Combat Unit, which fought bravely against the enemy in Luzon, establishing outstanding military exploits, was previously awarded medals by the Commander-in-Chief. The Army Ministry announced on the 13th that the above incident has been reported to the Emperor. The Ito Close Combat Unit was formed by Sergeant Ito Masatsugu as the leader, and consisted of 47 non-commissioned officers. On the night of the 2nd, the Close Combat Unit launched a brave attack against the enemy armored units moving south to Manila near Santa Maria and Polo, destroying eight enemy tanks, four troop carriers, and one tow truck, killing and wounding more than 350 personnel. Less than 20 Japanese soldiers also died valiantly.

### Japanese Troops on Iwo Jima Extend Battle Results

Tokyo, 13th (Central News Agency) – Japanese troops on Iwo Jima continued to fiercely counterattack the enemy in the area from the front of the drifting northern tribe to Mount Tenno and Mount Higashiyama on the 11th. During the day, due to enemy artillery fire and bombing, the Japanese army mostly carried out night close combat, resulting in significant combat results. The Japanese tank units have been engaged in fierce battles with superior enemy tanks every day since the enemy landed. Therefore, the losses of combat during the day have naturally accumulated. However, the morale of the Japanese soldiers remains as high as ever. From March 1 to 10, the confirmed combat results achieved by the Japanese tank units are as follows: burning eight enemy tanks and killing and wounding 1,200 enemy soldiers.

### Investigation Diary of Dongting Mountain (1)

— Yifei

The work of evacuating the population of this city is gradually becoming more active. Previously, Mr. Xiang Kangyuan's suggestion to open Dongting Mountain as an evacuation area has attracted the attention of the general public. Therefore, the reporter was dispatched to investigate the area and stayed for four days. The observations along the way are summarized and reported below.

Situation Along the Way

There are two routes from Suzhou to Dongting. One is to take the Lianrong or Flying Tiger steamship of Baoda and Tongmao Shipping Companies from the Yongyuan Wharf at the bridgehead of Dayang Bridge outside the West Gate, passing through Hengtang, Yuexi, Hengjing, Puzhuang, Shitang, and Ducun, directly reaching Qianshan of Dongshan. The other is to take the civil aviation ship, commonly known as "Longfei Fast," from Mudu and going through Xukou, passing through North Taihu Lake to Dongshan. If the weather is clear and the wind is favorable, sailing will take a shortcut. Although the steamship departs a little later, it arrives earlier. The former is a total of 90 li, and it also stops along the way to pick up passengers, so it takes six or seven hours. The latter is because lake bandits are rampant, and pedestrians are insufficient. Steamships are safer, so the reporter abandoned this route and took the other.

At 9:00 AM, the steamship departed from Suzhou, and arrived at Hengtang Town in about three quarters of an hour. The ship passed over Caiyun Bridge, which was built of large stones and is very high. The local folk song goes, "Suzhou's high bridge is not high, Hengtang also has Caiyun Bridge." The local lime kilns and pottery factories are very developed, and the raw material, bluestone, all comes from Xishan in Dongting. The Tongyi Lime Company is a large enterprise there. Leaving Hengtang, it reaches Cuiliu Lake via Huangshan. There is Mount Shangfang here, and there is a temple on the top of the mountain. Every year during the Mid-Autumn Festival, devout men and women from all over come here to offer incense, which is very lively. Opposite Mount Shangfang is Jiang Taigong's Fishing Platform. The so-called Shuangdun is two small mounds, only about ten feet high, covered with weeds, isolated in the lake. Passing Yuexi to Hengjing Town, huge wine jars are stacked like mountains on both sides of the river. According to a fellow passenger, 90% of the farmers in Hengjing use winemaking as a side business, and the wine lees are used to feed pigs. Now that rice prices are soaring, the cost of wine is also high. After the villagers make it, they sell it to the wine merchants, who transport it to Shanghai for resale. Currently, small jars of wine (60 market catties) sell for about 30,000 yuan in the countryside. After being transported to Shanghai, they can get 40,000 yuan. Large jars (400 catties) are worth about 220,000 to 30,000 yuan. In addition to paying the Ministry of Finance's wine license fee of 600 yuan per jar, the expenses along the way are also considerable, and it is not easy to make a profit. However, due to the pig-raising relationship, many villagers are still engaged in this business.

It takes about four hours to travel from Hengjing to Dongshan. The lunch on the boat is exceptionally rich, with five dishes and one soup, including large fish and meat, costing 700 yuan per person. Such a situation is not possible in rice-expensive cities like Shanghai.

Scenic Spots and Specialties

Dongting Mountain is located on the shore of Taihu Lake, one of the seventy-two peaks, with beautiful scenery and a reputation throughout Jiangnan. The mountain is divided into East and West, and the two mountains are separated by only one body of water. Travel depends on small boats. When the wind is favorable, it takes about an hour to reach the other side. The surface of Taihu Lake is vast, and the wind and waves are very large. However, in the "bay" between the two mountains, the lake surface suddenly narrows, and the waterway also becomes rapid. Therefore, the boat travels very slowly against the current.

Dongshan is surrounded by water on three sides, with only one side connected to land, forming a peninsula shape. The area of Dongshan is 48.5 maps, with a length of about 18 li. The reporter spent three days traveling all over the "Qianshan," "Houshan," and "Shanhou" of the mountain, visiting farmers, and investigating everything. I also climbed the highest peak of Dongshan, Dajinding (also known as Moli Peak, 400 meters high). At that time, because it was close to dusk, the wind on the top of the mountain was very strong. You could see Xishan across the shore from a distance. Looking down at the lake, the flat boats seemed like leaves drifting with the waves. The scenery was excellent.

The fruits produced in Dongting are well-known far and wide. From apricots to tangerines, there are as many as sixteen varieties. In particular, the loquats and waxberries of the lakeside villages in the bay of Houshan (also known as Qiawan) and the famous tea Biluochun are known to everyone. They are delicious and sweet, with a fragrant aroma. Due to geological reasons, the quality of Xishan is slightly inferior and cannot be compared with Dongshan. In addition to fruits, the fishery industry in Dongting Mountain is also very developed. Fishermen have built fish ponds along Taihu Lake, with more than 10,000 ponds. On average, two fishing boats are fully loaded with fish and shrimp every day, heading to Suzhou, Shanghai, and other places for sale.

Xishan is isolated in Taihu Lake, with an area of 72.5 maps, a north-south length of about 45 li, and is surrounded by many huge rocks protruding into the lake. Due to the abundance of lime, it is constantly impacted by lake water, resulting in many cavities, forming rock garden shapes. There are many scenic spots in the mountain, the first being Shigong Mountain in Zhenxia Township. The area is surrounded by the lake on three sides, and connected to the mountains on one side. Stone walls stand on all sides, as high as ten feet. Famous scenic spots include Yixiantian (One Line Sky), Yunti (Cloud Ladder), Guiyun Cave (Returning Cloud Cave), Xiguang Cave (Sunset Cave), and Longzhu (Dragon Islet). Linwu Cave is the most famous, built along the mountain and about 200 feet deep.

Due to geological reasons (coal ash and carboniferous layers), the fruits produced in Xishan are not as good as those in Dongshan. However, the Bisha loquats in Huili Township and the waxberries in Shandong Village in Zhenxia Township can also be compared with Dongshan. The Qing stone is produced in Lucun Township (the township has nearly a hundred large wooden boats dedicated to transporting Qing stone through Taihu Lake to Suzhou, Jiaxing, and other places, as raw materials for making lime. There are three lime kilns in the area, with nearly 500 workers). Donghu Town has coal mines (the town has two coal mining companies, Baocheng and Baoshan, which are currently under military management. Most of the products are transported to Suzhou for the power plant's needs. The founder, Luo Gantang, has a history of more than 20 years. There are nearly a thousand workers now). The silkworm breeding industry on the mountain is also quite developed. (To be continued)

### Construction Bureau to Re-inspect Vehicles

The Municipal Construction Bureau will directly handle matters related to water and electricity machinery, advertisements, construction, house repairs, etc. in the future. When applying for the above matters, please contact the relevant departments of the Bureau on the fourth floor of the Municipal Government Building on Hankou Road.

Furthermore, the Bureau believes that many of the rickshaws and pedicabs in the city are old and dilapidated, with damaged bodies, and are still operating on the streets. This is not only detrimental to the appearance of the city, but also has a great impact on the safety of passengers. Therefore, in order to thoroughly rectify this situation, it has been decided to re-inspect all commercial vehicles in the city. This plan is being actively prepared.

Part of Charity Performance Ticket Sales Allocated First

Students from various universities in Shanghai previously organized a charity performance of "Wealthy Clouds" to raise scholarship funds for this newspaper. Because some ticket sales revenue has not yet been cleared, the accounts have been temporarily suspended from settlement and announcement. However, in order to issue supplementary book and supply subsidies to all students, which will cost a total of ten million yuan, and the remaining scholarship funds are insufficient, the accounting section of the "Student National Covenant for Scholarships" allocated 1.5 million yuan each time. The rest will be cleared and allocated once the accounts are settled.

### The Shanghai General Post Office During Wartime

— Xi

The General Post Office on North Sichuan Road is the main hub for the transfer of mail in Shanghai. Before the war, 160,000 to 200,000 letters were distributed from here to the world every day; even in a very small village or town, letters with the Shanghai postmark could be found. But now, at most, there are only 70,000 to 80,000 letters. The post office has the important mission of conveying news for millions of people, so any negligence or slackness in its work will have a serious impact.

The economic situation of the post office is currently very difficult. The main reason, of course, is that there are fewer people sending letters than before, and the increase in postage rates cannot keep up with the general rise in prices. Of course, there are many other reasons that are not known to outsiders.

The salaries of post office employees are paid three times a month. The lowest salary is 24,000 yuan, and the highest is only 40,000 yuan. This amount is clearly insufficient to maintain a normal life for a family. Therefore, the families of postal assistants and postal workers have to eat corn flour, sweet potatoes, and drink thin porridge. They are living a poor life. The "iron rice bowl," which used to be envied by everyone, is no longer admired. As a result, some employees have changed careers, some are "waiting for orders at home," and some have died of poverty and illness. The Bureau is no longer hiring new people. The post office employees have no welfare organizations at all. Only those who reach the age of sixty and retire receive a pension of 200,000 yuan, but how can every employee enjoy this right!

Due to the heavy pressure of life, employees are always thinking about rice, firewood, oil, and salt when they work, which affects work efficiency. Because postmen are not often checked or harassed by the military police, some of them often do small business, or transport rice, noodles, coal balls, etc. for others. Therefore, the people who clear the mailboxes sometimes cannot collect the mail on time, and the distribution of mail may wait until personal matters are completed. Some sorters inevitably lack the energy to work, which affects the speed of delivery. However, there is another reason why letters are received later in this city, and that is inspection. Currently, out of the 40,000 to 50,000 letters sent out by the General Post Office every day, more than 10,000 are selected for inspection. This kind of inspection is of course very necessary during wartime, but it will delay the mail by three or four days, and sometimes up to a month. In the past, all letters were stamped with a "inspection stamp" after inspection, but this procedure is now less common.

If the treatment of post office employees is not improved, and if transportation tools such as boats and vehicles do not run on time, the phenomenon of delayed delivery will naturally not be improved in a short time.

### Shipping Lines Resumed Yesterday - Fares Remain Unchanged

The shipping lines navigating the upper and lower reaches of the Yangtze River, which were suspended last week due to unforeseen circumstances, have reportedly resumed operations yesterday (the 13th), according to sources in the Shanghai shipping industry.

It is reported that the ships departing today (the 14th) include the Wansheng Wheel (to Ningbo) and the Yutong Wheel (to Chongming in northern Jiangsu), and the fares remain the same.

Shipping Administration Bureau Establishes Offices

It is understood that each office will be in charge of all shipping administration registration and tax collection matters.

### Dinghai and Changzhou Natives Preparing to Evacuate

In order to assist the authorities in promoting evacuation work and to facilitate natives returning to their hometowns, the Dinghai Native Association has organized an evacuation committee, appointing Zhu Zikui, Chen Yiting, Ding Zihua, Hong Qiliang, Chen Yunshi, Zhu Baofeng, Li Xuefan, Zhou Sanyuan, Zhao Wengui, Wu Zongda, Chen Mansheng, and Lin Yibin as committee members.

In order to cooperate with the Shanghai Municipal Government and the Shanghai Population Evacuation Committee in evacuation work, the Changzhou Shanghai Native Association has established the Changzhou Shanghai Evacuation Population Preparation Committee, appointing preparation committee members to begin preparations.

The first evacuation ship is scheduled to depart around the 20th of this month.

### Post Office Strictly Prohibits Extortion

Recently, there have been rumors that due to the low salaries and difficult living conditions of postal workers in this city, they intend to collect a certain amount of handling fees from recipients when delivering letters. Yesterday, the local postal authorities stated that they have heard of the rumors. While it is true that the living conditions of postal workers are difficult, the Bureau has reported the situation to the highest postal authorities and requested a further adjustment to employee salaries, which is currently being actively considered. However, if employees solicit additional fees when delivering mail, it is a clear act of dereliction of duty, which not only violates postal regulations, but also violates the criminal law. The Bureau has issued a notice to all employees to this effect and instructed all supervisors to pay attention to this matter at all times. It is hoped that the public will assist the Bureau. If they encounter any instances of extortion, they should strictly refuse and record the postal carrier's number and inform the Bureau so that it can be dealt with strictly.

### Materials Control Authorities to Hold Weekly Consultations

For example, if difficulties arise in the movement of essential materials and need to be resolved, or if there are problems in the approval of transportation procedures, etc., the matters to be consulted on are all important events such as the movement, procurement, and allocation of materials under the wartime control economic national policy.
