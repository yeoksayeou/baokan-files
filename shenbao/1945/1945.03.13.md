### Minister Zhao Promulgates Broadcast Speech: Destroying Unity Endangers the Nation

Regarding the significance of urgently promoting peaceful unification, I have already exhaustively explained it to the compatriots nationwide on January 20th with the title "Peaceful Unification and Freedom and Independence." Now, I want to especially bring it up again to declare that all compatriots nationwide, regardless of whether they are in Nanjing or Chongqing, regardless of whether they advocate peace or war, must realize that the nation's future is only one, and the fate of the nation is only one. We cannot avoid disaster together, and we cannot enjoy blessings alone. Just like we are now piously commemorating the Founding Father, why can't our footsteps uniformly follow the path indicated by the Founding Father's teachings? Could it be said that our Chinese nation's future and destiny can have two? Furthermore, we have gained valuable lessons from the flames of war everywhere. We believe that the obstacle and destroyer of our Chinese unification work is the Chinese Communist Party. The actions of the Chinese Communist Party have always been contrary to the interests of the nation, and have always been destructive to China's unification and construction. What they do and what they say are often completely unrelated, engaging in the trickery of selling dog meat under the pretense of selling mutton. Now, even Chongqing understands this point.

The Dispute Between the Kuomintang and the Communists Has Remained Unresolved

On March 1st of this year, at the Chongqing Constitutional Implementation Promotion Association, there was such a remark: "The issue between the Central Government and the Communist Party has always been an unresolved question. Experience tells us that as long as one demand is agreed to, the Communist Party will further demand the acceptance of more demands. The Central Government makes compromises, preparing to negotiate a reasonable solution with the Communist Party, but the solutions proposed by the Communist Party are entirely for the Communist Party's sake. If the Communist Party is for the sake of the nation's future, for the final victory of the War of Resistance, and not for seizing power, then reasonable solutions should be accepted." Chongqing also understands that the Chinese Communist Party is constantly thinking about seizing power, overthrowing the National Government, and eliminating the Chinese Kuomintang, but it is too late. We have long known that all the high-sounding words sung by the Communist Party are false, all lies to deceive the whole world and the people nationwide. We believe that as long as the Communist Party exists for one day, the unification of China and the revival of the nation are impossible. Therefore, the National Government's peaceful anti-communist national policy, as well as the "establishment of public security" and "rectification of thought" measures, are all to thoroughly eliminate the Communist Party to save the nation and the people, and are all to enable China to be independent and free externally, and peacefully unified internally.

Loyally Following the Founding Father's Teachings

For the sake of the nation's survival and the nation's revival, we must eliminate the Communist Party like locusts. Therefore, I hope that compatriots will not honestly let the Communist Party bury themselves, nor be cowardly and listen to the Communist Party's sweet words and honeyed phrases. We must prioritize the future of national unification, strive to eliminate the Communist Party, and at the same time extinguish the Communist Party's heresies. We know that the Communist Party's current fields can only grow weeds, and the articles written by the Communist Party are lies. Today, we are commemorating the Founding Father with vigilance. We can only loyally follow the Three Principles of the People. The Three Principles of the People are the source of our thought. Compatriots nationwide, with one heart and one mind, united from top to bottom, under the leadership of Acting Chairman Chen, "seek peaceful unification internally" and "seek independent freedom externally," realize the Founding Father's teachings, complete the late Chairman Wang's legacy, and the more severely we reproach ourselves today, and the more fiercely we encourage ourselves, the closer the entire light of the nation and the entire prosperity of the nation will be to us.

### Crushing the Enemy's Scheming Warfare

The battle in the Philippines has been dragging on for a long time, and it remains deadlocked as before. The enemy's plan to resolve the Philippines in a very short period of time has clearly been completely crushed.

The enemy is currently in the Philippines, especially in the Manila area of Luzon, in a dilemma. Advancing, they are met with strong Japanese resistance everywhere, resulting in great losses; retreating, they are mired in deep mud, making extrication difficult. Under these awkward circumstances, the enemy's anxiety and distress can be said to be unparalleled.

With the orthodox military offensive unable to be used, in an attempt to escape their predicament, the enemy has not hesitated to use all kinds of despicable and cunning means to intensify their so-called scheming warfare.

Slandering the reputation of the military is one of the enemy's despicable scheming tactics. Wherever the enemy troops in the Philippines go, they often turn homes into ruins and residents are brutally massacred, especially when attacking Manila. The enemy is now deliberately implementing a scorched-earth policy in the Philippines, displaying barbaric behavior. On the other hand, they are making false propaganda about these acts of burning and killing, shifting the blame to the Japanese army, claiming that it is the result of the Japanese army's scorched-earth strategy, and secretly trying to provoke the Filipinos to develop resentment and even hatred towards the Japanese army. They not only attempt to incite illusions among the Filipinos, but also attempt to incite other East Asian nations to doubt and be dissatisfied with the Japanese army.

The enemy, unable to break the deadlock, in addition to emotionally inciting the Filipinos, also wants to further exploit the Filipinos, driving them to become cannon fodder and make trouble for the Japanese army. In some areas of the Philippines, the enemy has recently been found to be enticing a small number of ignorant Filipinos and bandits to organize so-called guerrilla groups to confront the often surprisingly victorious Japanese commando units, hoping to create a situation where East Asians kill each other, so as to profit from it and achieve their aggressive ambitions.

The enemy's strategy of using rumors, shifting blame, and trying to gain the cooperation of the indigenous Filipinos actually demonstrates that the enemy has lost its own military confidence in the war. The trend of a spent arrow is exposed very clearly.

The unity of the East Asian nations is what the enemy is most jealous of; and the means of sowing discord is the enemy's customary trick. However, the various shocking atrocities and consistent acts of aggression committed by the enemy in East Asia in the past and present have always been clearly revealed, and even if they try to cover them up, it is expected to be difficult to succeed. Most people in East Asia have long seen through the enemy's conspiracy. Currently, under the leadership of Japan, the East Asian nations' belief in common death and the pursuit of common life is becoming stronger, and unity is becoming more consolidated, which cannot be dissolved by the enemy's false propaganda and malicious incitement in the slightest.

The Philippines is a member of the East Asian nations. In the past, under the brutal rule of the enemy, the Filipinos suffered endless pain. When the Greater East Asia War broke out, the Filipinos bravely stepped forward to help the Japanese army drive out the enemy. Subsequently, with Japan's sincere support, the Philippines achieved the independence and freedom that it had struggled for for many years in the hands of the enemy, and the Filipinos' excitement is well known. Now that the enemy has returned, the Filipinos, who have insight into the enemy's conspiracy, will naturally do their best to cooperate with the Japanese army, who is helping them, to defend the independence they have gained through hardship. The enemy's scheming warfare will inevitably be completely frustrated along with the failure of their military strategy.

The Chinese nation, at the critical juncture of the decisive battle, must also clearly understand the enemy's conspiracy. The enemy is now planning to expand the use of mainland China as a battlefield. We should wake up early, resolutely join hands with Japan to achieve overall peace, and the people in the peace zone must not be seduced by the enemy again. Under the leadership of Acting Chairman Chen, we should persist in cooperating with the allied nations to crush the enemy's ambitions.

### In the Area of Lingayen; Japanese Army Commando Warfare; Fierce Fighting East of Manila

Tokyo, 12th (Central News Agency) - There is no major change in the war situation on Luzon Island. However, the fighting is gradually intensifying on the two front lines of the eastern area of Manila and Lingayen. Since the evening of the 7th, the enemy forces have once again launched an attack towards the east of Manila, targeting the east of Montalban (12 kilometers northeast of Majayjay) and the front of Antipolo. On the 11th, the fighting in Antipolo became increasingly fierce. Near Morong, 7 kilometers east of the east coast of Laguna de Bay, 400 enemy troops fiercely bombarded with mortars. The enemy troops are still reinforcing. The actions of the guerrilla forces in that area are gradually becoming more active. On the Lingayen front, the Japanese army, 15 kilometers north of San Jose, continued to launch commando attacks on the enemy's positions. On the 11th, under the leadership of Lieutenant Ono, they injured more than 50 enemy soldiers north of San Jose, and destroyed two automatic trucks and one barrack, and the entire Japanese army returned safely. East of San Nicolas, in the direction of Santa Rosa, about 500 enemy troops, carrying heavy grenade launchers and many field guns, attempted to break through the Japanese army's positions on the 11th, and their actions were slightly active.

### Enemy Landing in Zamboanga Met With Japanese Defenders' Attack

Mindanao Island Frontline Base, 11th (Central News Agency) - The enemy that landed in Zamboanga at the southwestern tip of Mindanao Island, on the 10th, used 1,500 troops and 30 tanks to attack the airfield. The Japanese garrison immediately launched an attack, and fierce fighting is currently underway.

Philippine Frontline, 10th (Central News Agency) - After the enemy forces shelled Zamboanga at the southwestern tip of Mindanao Island, on the morning of the 9th, two cruisers, six destroyers, eighteen landing boats, two submarine chasers, and one minelayer appeared on the sea off Zamboanga, and fiercely shelled the airfield and coastal areas. At 3:00 PM, they finally began landing in Zamboanga. At the same time, Basilan Island, opposite Zamboanga, also began landing at 9:30 AM on the morning of the 8th.

### The Kingdom of Annam; Declares Independence

Hue, 11th (Central News Agency) - The 23 million people of Annam have suffered French oppression for nearly 60 years, and now the day of national liberation has arrived. Emperor Bao Dai of the Kingdom of Annam convened a cabinet meeting on the 10th to discuss various independence strategies. At noon on the 11th, he convened all the ministers in the Can Chanh Palace and issued the Declaration of Independence of the Kingdom of Annam, the original text of which is as follows: "The government of the Kingdom of Annam, from this day forward, abolishes the French-Annam Protectorate Treaty and declares the complete restoration of the independent Kingdom of Annam, in order to achieve future development and the co-existence and co-prosperity of Greater East Asia. In order to achieve this goal, the Kingdom of Annam is determined to trust Japan's sincerity and exert all its strength to assist the Japanese Empire."

### Saigon Entirely Returns to Normalcy

Saigon, 12th (Central News Agency) - On the dawn of the 11th, Saigon had completely returned to normalcy. The streets and alleys were crowded with French people. All closed transportation areas, except for a few important ones, have been opened. The Madong trams are also running as usual. Among the French people detained in the city, only the governor-general, the military attache, and the commander are the leading figures. The general public and civil servants are not subject to any detention and their lives and property are guaranteed. The Japanese's tolerant attitude towards the French deeply surprised the French themselves. It was very clear that the Vietnamese leadership suspected that Japan would take military action and made various preparations. Japan, to the end, always adopted a diplomatic negotiation approach through its ambassador. However, due to the Vietnamese army's senseless resistance, it had no choice but to lead to the incident of military action. However, it still treated the general French population with extreme leniency. The general French population deeply regretted the measures taken by the governor-general and the leadership this time, and some even severely criticized the governor-general's lack of effort in refusing to strengthen joint defense.

### Chongqing's Prospects for the War of Resistance; Filled With Difficulties

(Central News Agency, Shanghai Dispatch) - Yesterday (the 12th) was the 20th anniversary of the death of the Founding Father Sun Yat-sen. It is heard that Chiang Kai-shek issued a "Letter to the People of the Whole Country," the content of which was filled with the implication that Chongqing's prospects for the War of Resistance were extremely difficult. Two points of its general meaning are extracted below:

(1) Since China initiated the National Revolution in the year of Yiyou, it has now been sixty years. Today, on this day of the sixtieth year, China has encountered unprecedented difficulties in its history.

(2) If we still harbor the concept of seeking temporary ease and security, then the countless people's arduous struggles and sacrifices in the past will become meaningless. However, the Yan'an Xinhua News Agency, while commemorating the anniversary of Mr. Sun's death, vehemently criticized Chiang Kai-shek, declaring that the successor to Mr. Sun's legacy is the Chinese Communist Party, and severely attacking Chiang's unreasonable dictatorship, and pointed out that Chiang's actions are contrary to the Chinese revolution and Mr. Sun's will. It even said that the Kuomintang is based on its counter-revolution to deceive the revolution, so it is re-enacting the tragedy of revolution and counter-revolution, and China's future has reached a state of infinite darkness.

From this perspective, both Chongqing and Yan'an are vying to continue Mr. Sun's legacy, but both sides are doing so with opposite means. However, if we examine the declaration issued by the National Government when it returned to Nanjing, it is truly the orthodox successor to the Founding Father's legacy. Memorial ceremonies are being jointly held throughout the peace zone. Based on Mr. Sun's Pan-Asianism, China and Japan must cooperate closely and advance together to achieve the construction of a New East Asia.

### Suzhou's Model Air-Raid Shelter; Groundbreaking Ceremony Held

Suzhou, 12th (Central News Agency) - The Suzhou Provincial People's Self-Defense Facilities Committee was established, and at 10:00 AM on the 11th, a groundbreaking ceremony for a model air-raid shelter was held in the park. The people participating were enthusiastic. First, Governor Ren gave a speech, the words of which were quite sincere, and the listeners were moved. Then, Director Sun Yucai of the Construction Department reported on the process. Pan Zichao, a representative of the people, gave a reply. All sectors of the city unanimously promoted it, and people started to imitate and build them, with remarkable results.

### German Head of State Declares; Determination to Continue the War of Resistance; Encouraging Soldiers on Heroes' Memorial Day

Berlin, 12th (Central News Agency) - German News Agency report: German Head of State Hitler, on Sunday's Heroes' Memorial Day, issued a message to the soldiers, declaring that they would fight against the common enemy until the enemy was exhausted and collapsed. The gist of his message is as follows: "Although fate may seem unfavorable to us at this time, the perseverance and courage of the German people will surely overcome various setbacks. I am determined not to let the situation of 1918 repeat itself, and I hope that we all have this will. The enemy has clearly expressed its desire to eliminate the German nation. Today, on the tenth anniversary of the implementation of universal military service, the German people have only one task, that is, to be determined to risk all dangers to change the situation. Those who are unwilling to fulfill this task, we must also be determined to eliminate. Heaven helps those who help themselves."

### Fierce Fighting Unfolds in Northern Iwo Jima

Tokyo, 12th (Central News Agency) - Since the night of the 8th, the enemy forces on Iwo Jima have gradually intensified their naval gun bombardment, with the focus concentrated on the Japanese army's positions in the northern area. As a result, the battle in that area has become increasingly fierce since the 10th. The enemy forces are stubbornly attempting to invade the Japanese army's positions from the south and west fronts of the Japanese army's northern strongholds. However, after a fierce attack by the main force of the Japanese army, they were repelled. As of around 6:00 PM on the 10th, they were still securing their positions and continuing to fight hard. Furthermore, at noon on the 10th, 300 enemy troops with six tanks invaded Kojima, east of the Japanese army's positions in the northern area. The Japanese army in the north immediately launched an attack, and fierce fighting is currently underway. The Japanese army on Mount Suribachi broke into the enemy's position north of Mount Suribachi on the night of the 8th and inflicted heavy damage on them, causing them to fall into a state of great chaos. The Japanese army on Mount Suribachi is still holding its ground and fighting hard. The battle results in the northern area alone on the 9th are estimated to have resulted in the loss of more than 800 enemy troops and the destruction of one tank.

### The Huge Cost of American Flying Fortresses

Large formations of B29 aircraft again bombed Tokyo and its surroundings on February 19th. Their tactics have changed, initially heading towards the East China Sea, then abruptly turning mid-course to invade the Kanto region, which proves their painstaking efforts. However, the results obtained are still minimal, with very little damage on the ground. Due to this situation, the United States is clamoring that "the B29 is a failed weapon," forcing the US military leaders to urgently seek a short-term decisive battle, attempting to acquire an intermediate base for bombing the Japanese mainland. They plan to replace the B29 with the B24, which has the highest production volume recently, and form a strong escort team with B38 and other direct escort fighters to bomb the Japanese mainland. Their objective in attacking Iwo Jima is also obvious.

The United States, which insists on being the best in the world in everything, has disregarded various production difficulties and created the world's first super-heavy bomber, the "Flying Fortress." While the performance and size of the B29 are indeed world-class, they have not paid attention to its enormous consumption, which is also world-class.

The total production cost of a single B29 is $750,000, requiring 80 tons of materials and 200,000 man-hours. Each round trip between Saipan and Tokyo requires 7,000 gallons of gasoline. The total US budget is $900 billion, of which $1,450 B29s cost $111.375 billion, meaning that the production cost of the B29 accounts for more than one-eightieth of the country's total budget. The total gasoline consumption for 1,700 B29s attacking Japan is 32,600 tons, accounting for 4% of its annual gasoline production of 8 million tons. To date, 629 B29s have been lost, and the estimated material required is 5,320 tons. Most of this material is aluminum alloy, accounting for about 5% of its aluminum production. With 11 crew members per B29, the number of unreturned personnel has reached 6,919, accounting for 7% of the total number of 100,000 US air service personnel.

Furthermore, the total number of employees in the US aviation industry is said to be 2 million. The working hours lost for the 629 B29s amount to 200.7 million hours. Assuming an average of 9 hours of work per day, this requires 23 million man-days, approximately equivalent to the work of all 2 million employees in the US aviation industry for 11 and a half days. In other words, the crystallization of 200 aviation factories, each with 10,000 workers, for 11 and a half days has been turned into wreckage.

On February 19th, a large formation of 100 B29s again bombed Tokyo. Before the war, the United States claimed that just 100 aircraft could turn Tokyo, made of wood chips, into ashes. However, after being bombed by a cumulative total of 1,700 super-heavy bombers and 1,600 carrier-based aircraft, has Tokyo been reduced to ashes? Facts speak louder than words. This fully demonstrates how excellent and powerful the Japanese air defense line is, which has created a world record for the rate of enemy aircraft shot down – 37% of the total number. If this rate of destruction continues to increase, the monthly production of the B29 may not be sufficient to compensate for its losses. At the same time, the decline in crew quality is also an undeniable fact, as can be seen from the recent gradual decrease in the accuracy of US aircraft bombing. From this perspective, the argument that the B29 is a "failed weapon" is indeed well-founded. (Translated from the February 22nd issue of the Mainichi Shimbun)

### Intensified Battle Situation on the Irrawaddy River Line – Japanese Forces Launch Fierce Counterattacks

Central News Agency, Burmese Front, 12th: The battle situation on the Irrawaddy River front is intensifying as the dry season approaches. Japanese forces are launching fierce counterattacks against the British-Indian 7th Division. According to reports from various sources, the battle situation there is as follows: (1) On the right flank, in the plains southeast of New Yegu on the Irrawaddy River, the main force of the enemy's 19th Division is again invading the right bank of the Irrawaddy, echoing the New Yegu forces, attempting to gradually close in on the Japanese positions. The battle situation has clearly intensified since the day before yesterday. Furthermore, the enemy forces advancing south of Wacheng from the 3rd, possessing powerful tanks and artillery, launched a large-scale offensive, but the Japanese forces fought bravely with a small force and crushed the enemy's attempt. (2) In the central sector, the British forces invading the Sagaing-Yinmabin line have suffered over 5,000 casualties from intense Japanese artillery fire. The center of the fierce fighting remains around Nanzi. The enemy forces, with several tanks, are attempting to probe the Japanese positions. The Japanese forces are counterattacking from the southeast, west, and three sides to prevent the enemy's advance. Therefore, the enemy is also attempting to expand the bridgehead on the south bank but has encountered Japanese counterattacks, and the enemy's progress is extremely slow. (3) On the left flank, the enemy's attacks from the intersection of the Kothaung and Irrawaddy rivers to the Mingun area have slowed down since this month. There have been no major changes on that front. However, the enemy forces crossing the river from Nyaung-u are facing continuous and fierce counterattacks from the Japanese forces. As the enemy forces continue to concentrate their forces from Nyaung-u, attempting to desperately break through the Meiktila Highway, the Japanese forces are repeatedly counterattacking and are pressing westward.

### Zhejiang Establishes Local Product and Material Management Committee

Central News Agency, Nanjing, 12th: In order to increase the production of local products, facilitate transportation and sales, regulate the economy, and revive the market, the Zhejiang Provincial authorities have established the Zhejiang Provincial Local Product and Material Management Committee. Management offices have been set up under the committee and have been officially established and have begun operations.

Hereafter, the operation of the above-mentioned local products and materials must be registered in accordance with the regulations, and movement permits must be obtained. At the same time, a management fee of 10% must be paid according to the valuation before they can be moved; otherwise, they will be banned.

### Party Headquarters Elections in Three Provinces and Two Cities to be Completed by Deadline

Central News Agency, Nanjing, 12th: In order to strengthen party affairs and consolidate the party base, the Kuomintang has decided to restore the election system for party headquarters at all levels. The Standing Committee passed the "Outline for the Election of Party Headquarters at All Levels Below Provincial and Municipal Special Municipalities" at its 98th meeting. Except for the provinces and cities in the north, which will be handled separately, the party headquarters in the three provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui, and the two cities of Nanjing and Shanghai, must complete the elections of party headquarters in all counties and districts (urban areas) before May 15th of this year. The three provinces of Hubei, Jiangxi, and Guangdong, and the city of Hankou, must complete the elections within two months of receiving the notice. Furthermore, the election methods for special party headquarters in the military, navy, and railways are the same as those for county and district party branches.

### Major Decisive Battle Unfolds on the East Bank of the Rhine River

Central News Agency, Lisbon, 12th: According to reports from embedded reporters with the Associated Press, the German army will launch a large-scale counteroffensive against the anti-Axis bridgehead on the opposite bank of Remagen. German reinforcements are arriving one after another, and a major decisive battle is unfolding.

Central News Agency, Berlin, 12th: According to reports from Haitong News Agency, enemy artillery fire can still be heard in Weisgniaret and the Eifel region. However, the area that should be paid attention to is still around Linzi City, between Honnef and Honningen. The enemy continues to cross the Rhine River and send reinforcements, and the enemy still holds bridgeheads in Niterbersich, Bairul, and Antenach. Between Koblenz and Trier, the enemy continues to exert heavy pressure towards the Moselle region. General Blatherley's forces have advanced to Kagen in the Moselle River basin but have not been able to cross the river.

### In West Prussia, Germany Shortens the Line of Defense; Soviet Forces Invade Danzig Amidst Wind and Snow

Central News Agency, Berlin, 12th: According to Haitong News Agency, Soviet forces, with five divisions, launched a new offensive between Schwazenwalde and Pilitz, attempting to break into the Moravian Plain. Their repeated attacks on Marienwerder were all blocked by the German defenders. On the northern flank of the Eastern Front, Stettin and Danzig-Gotenhafen remain the focus of the Soviet offensive. Although Marshal Zhukov attacked the Stettin bridgehead with large tanks, he has not yet reached Altdamm. The German army has shortened its defensive line in Danzig Harbor and Gotenhafen in West Prussia and has thwarted the enemy's attempt to split the German front line.

Central News Agency, Stockholm, 12th: According to front-line reports, Soviet troops entered the southern suburbs of the Free City of Danzig on the 10th and launched street battles in severe wind and snow. The left wing of the army also began operations from Kalisch-Kielgar, 26 kilometers west of the Free City of Danzig, and attacked the port of Kuggenia. It now appears that they have broken into the northeastern part of the port. The Danzig Corridor front has become unusually tense.

Finally, the music was played, and the ceremony concluded.

Speech by the Chairman: Liu Yangshan, representing the presidium, delivered the opening remarks: Distinguished officials, comrades, today is the 20th anniversary of the death of the Founding Father. When we recall the misfortunes encountered by our party and the disasters encountered by the people in the past twenty years, we feel sadness. Since the start of the Sino-Japanese Incident, the greatest misfortune in the history of the Chinese Revolution, that is, the greatest misfortune encountered by China. Until the return of the national government to its capital in the 29th year of the Republic, it can be said to be the re-departure of the Chinese Revolution. With the start of the Greater East Asia War, it can be said that the Chinese Revolution, with very correct methods, has embarked on a very correct path, driving out the British and American imperialists. Now the British and American imperialists are still struggling in their last breath, and the Communist Party is still doing evil, so that the construction of the country cannot proceed smoothly. Therefore, we know that if the British and American imperialism is not eliminated one day, the Chinese Revolution will not be successful one day. In the future, we only have to fight to the death with the British and Americans, and the whole country must rise up together to assist friendly nations and jointly destroy the British and Americans in order to achieve the final success of the Chinese Revolution. Furthermore, if the Communist Party is not eradicated one day, the people will not be able to live in peace one day, that is, the revolution will not be successful one day. Therefore, in addition to assisting friendly nations in destroying the British and Americans, we must also eradicate the Communist Party, recognize our goals, recognize our path, and unite together to fight together.

Today is also Arbor Day. The so-called planting people and planting trees, a country without talents cannot carry out national affairs, and a country without timber cannot promote construction. Moreover, planting trees can regulate the climate and prevent disasters.

In short, we must think of the British and American imperialism, all kinds of oppression, which has brought us to this point. Everyone should be thoroughly awakened. Today, when commemorating the 20th anniversary of the death of the Founding Father, everyone should recognize it clearly.

Everyone does not have to be pessimistic about the misfortune of our country. We should use our own strength to save our current crisis. We should have a kind of self-confidence, believing that under the leadership of national leaders and Shanghai officials, we will definitely be able to achieve our expected goals and complete the mission of the revolution.

Speech by the Mayor: Then Mayor Zhou delivered a speech, elaborating on the revolutionary spirit of the Founding Father during his lifetime and his will "Peaceful Struggle to Save China" in great detail, exhorting the people of the country, with a very alarming tone, which moved the listeners.

Tree Planting Ceremony: The tree planting ceremony was held at the Bund Park at 10:00 AM. Mayor Zhou specially sent Secretary-General Luo to participate on his behalf. The Mayor's Tree Planting Ceremony was held in the center of the park, followed by the Secretary-General and the heads of various bureaus and departments. On time, in the midst of the sonorous military music, Secretary-General Luo led the heads of various bureaus and departments and representatives of the presidium to conduct the tree planting ceremony.

### Indigenous Vietnamese People Establish the Foundation for Independence; Minister Matsudaira Discusses the Vietnam Incident

The Shanghai Office of the Allied Japanese Embassy held its regular press conference yesterday afternoon. Minister Matsudaira reported on the recent Vietnam incident, expressing his feelings as follows:

The Japanese Imperial Government has taken independent defense measures in the South, and its minimum limit is to exclude hostile officials. In Shanghai, French military and police forces were disarmed as necessary. This measure seems to have had some impact on various parts of the world, but the statement issued by the Imperial Government has clearly stated that the French officials violated the joint defense agreement, gradually changed their attitude, and did not keep their faith, and were unwilling to cooperate jointly. Therefore, the military was forced to take this measure. As for the indigenous Vietnamese people, the Imperial Government stated in its statement that it will protect the homeland and provide absolute assistance to the indigenous people.

Vietnam has long been under French oppression, and its people have long hoped to realize independence under the principles of the Greater East Asia Declaration. Therefore, the statement of the Imperial Government has a great meaning in it. Vietnam refers to Annam, Tonkin, Cochinchina, Dongpuzhai and Laos. Cochinchina is a purely French colony, Annam and Tonkin are under protection treaties, Dongpuzhai is contracted by the King of Annam and France, and Laos is contracted by the chiefs individually with France, all of which are French protectorates. In the past 130 years, disputes have arisen from time to time. During the Qing Dynasty, the King of Annam requested China's assistance. The Qing army fought with France and succumbed to the French military until today.

Minister Matsudaira finally said that when I was in Guangdong, I met the leader of the Annam Independence Movement, Mr. Ling Zemin, who expressed his eagerness to restore the status of Annam. Today, this independent movement can be more hopeful. Now that the foundation for independence has been established, the goal of realizing their ideals can be achieved.

### Gold Inspection Office Cracks Down on Bank and Money Shop Profiteering

However, the interest rates charged by banks and money shops vary greatly. Some are increased based on established principles, while others are unwilling to increase or charge interest rates beyond the established principles. It is now known that the Financial Inspection Office of the Central Reserve Bank is paying close attention to the increase in interest rates by financial institutions. If anyone charges high interest rates outside the proper scope, they will be cracked down on.

A Stroll in the Suburbs

### General Situation of Fahua Town

— Xi

Location of Fahua Town

Although Fahua Town is a township name, it is already within the city limits. Take the Route 1 streetcar to the western terminus, exit the west entrance of Taishan Road, and walk a few dozen steps to reach the street entrance of West Fahua Town. The entire town is about two li in length. In the middle section of West Fahua is the site of the Fahua Zen Temple, now dilapidated. Fahua Town gets its name from this temple.

Visiting the Security Command

The western end of Fahua Town is the former site of Zhengshi Middle School, where the Municipal Security Command is now located. The reporter took the opportunity to assist a friend in the accounting office of the command, and was guided by the leadership to visit the various offices of the institution. The command has two divisions, the Staff Division and the General Affairs Division. The affiliated security teams of Fengxian, Nanhui, Shenjiang, Chongming, Jiading, Baoshan, and Chuansha counties are stationed in seven county districts. There are also three regiments, the Training Regiment No. 1 and Training Regiment No. 2. The Training Regiment is located at the headquarters, and the regimental commander is Mr. Han Shangying. Regiments No. 1 and No. 2 are located in the suburbs of the city.

The salaries of officers and soldiers of the security team have been adjusted separately since February. The monthly salary of a major general is 70,500 yuan, and the lowest lieutenant is 18,325 yuan. Officers receive three dou of Lao rice per month, and their families also receive three dou of rice. Officers at the headquarters are also provided with two meals, a benefit unmatched by any other municipal agency.

Visiting the Blockade Administration Office

The Municipal Clearing Countryside Area Blockade Administration Office is also located on the third floor of the Zhengshi school site. The office was previously under the jurisdiction of the Clearing Countryside Affairs Bureau, but on February 1st, it was directly under the Municipal Government. When the reporter visited the director's office to interview Director Gu Shuo, he was out on official business. However, Commissioner Zhu Qingshou was present. Director Gu took office as the director of the Songjiang District Salt Affairs Administration on the 3rd of this month, so he was unable to be in the office all day. The Blockade Administration Office has seven management offices and fifty-six checkpoints in the first, second, and third clearing countryside areas. The focus of work is in the suburban areas.

In addition to the Security Command and the Blockade Administration Office, the former Clearing Countryside Affairs Bureau was also located at the Zhengshi school site. Since Mr. Su Chengde took over as director, it has been moved to the old site of the Central Research Institute Experimental Hall on Yuyuan Road.

Overview of Industry, Commerce, and Education

Fahua Town has one main street running east-west. On both sides of the street are low-rise tile-roofed houses, all small shops and handicraft workshops. There are three factories in the town: one cotton ginning factory and two textile factories. All have been suspended due to limited raw materials and electricity. There is one primary school, the Fahua Obligatory School.

### Municipal Police Bureau Reorganizes Gun Licenses

The Municipal Police Bureau, having investigated the merger of the old First and Second Police Bureaus, finds it necessary to reinvestigate civilian firearms and change the permit format. For the sake of adjustment, the bureau is reorganizing gun licenses (including those for guards and storage). All license holders must submit their licenses to the Second Division (South 130) of the bureau for application procedures by the 25th of this month. If firearms are not registered within the registration period, they will be confiscated upon discovery, and the owners will be severely punished. Therefore, those who possess firearms and have never registered them should register before the aforementioned deadline. As for firearms in the custody of the bureau, for the sake of reconfirmation, the owners should submit their old receipts and reissue new receipts. For detailed information, please inquire with the Firearm License Section of the Police Preparedness Division of the Second Division.

### Zhenjiang Fellow Association Submits Petitions to Authorities Demanding Strict Arrest and Punishment of Murderer Jiang Shiyan

Regarding the case of Xu Xu Peiwen being brutally murdered by Black Hat Jiang Shiyan, the Zhenjiang Fellow Association yesterday specially submitted petitions to the Ministry of Construction requesting that the China Railway authorities be strictly ordered to improve road administration and rectify discipline, and continued to petition the Municipal Government to earnestly arrest the murderer. Excerpts from the petitions are as follows:

Petition to the Municipal Government

(Omitted above) "After investigating, Xu Xu Peiwen, the wife of Xu Sen, a member of the association, was brutally murdered by Black Hat Jiang Shiyan of the China Central Railway Company North Station on March 4th. The association reported the situation to your government on March 10th, requesting that the competent police bureau be strictly ordered to arrest the murderer and bring him to justice according to law. It has now been many days since the incident occurred, but the main offender Jiang Shiyan has not yet been arrested. Therefore, the association petitions your government to quickly order the police bureau to earnestly arrest the murderer. The association also intends to offer a reward for the arrest, so that the case can be solved as soon as possible, to ensure the safety of travelers and uphold the law."

Petition to the Ministry of Construction

(Omitted above) "After investigating, the employees of the China Central Railway Company (commonly known as Black Hats) are usually arrogant and unruly, and disregard the law, which has long been resented by the public. Now they dare to openly commit violence, resulting in death, which is truly outrageous. Moreover, the main offender Jiang Shiyan fled after the incident and has not been apprehended. The China Central Railway Company has long been lax in its management of its employees, resulting in such a tragedy occurring in the station witnessed by the public, which is already inexcusable. Moreover, after the incident, it still turned a blind eye, allowing the murderer to escape and remain at large, not only failing to fulfill its responsibility to assist in the arrest, but also showing no serious expression, which is deeply puzzling. Therefore, the association petitions your ministry to quickly order the China Central Railway Company to order the guarantor to hand over the murderer for arrest and prosecution, and to strictly order the company to earnestly improve road administration and rectify discipline, to ensure the safety of travelers."

### Seventh Welfare Football Match: Overseas Chinese Federation vs. Portuguese Merchants

The seventh Raleigh Football Tournament, organized by the Shanghai Football Association to raise medical funds for charitable organizations such as the Red Cross Third Hospital and Southeast Hospital, is scheduled to be held on the afternoon of the 15th of this month (Thursday) at the Racecourse. There are three types of tickets: 20,000, 10,000, and 5,000 yuan, which are sold separately by the aforementioned charitable organizations. The football association has decided that the opposing teams will be the Overseas Chinese Federation and the Portuguese Merchants. The two teams met once in the League A competition, and the Portuguese Merchants were defeated by the Overseas Chinese Federation by a score of 2-5. This time, the narrow road to revenge will inevitably lead the Portuguese Merchants to retaliate, and a fierce battle is expected.
