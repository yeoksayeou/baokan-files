### Zhang Jia'ao and Jiang Jingguo Arrive in Beiping; Immediately Fly to Changchun with Takeover Personnel; National Army Advances to Dahushan

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 2nd] Zhang Jia'ao, Director of the Economic Committee of the Northeast Headquarters, and Jiang Jingguo, Special Envoy for Foreign Affairs, along with their entourage, flew to Beiping in two planes this morning and will transfer to Changchun.

[Central News Agency, Beiping, 2nd] Zhang Jia'ao and Jiang Jingguo, accompanied by Qi Hewen, Second Secretary of the Soviet Embassy, arrived here by plane at 4:30 PM this afternoon. They immediately discussed matters with Hu Jiafeng, Secretary-General of the Northeast Headquarters, and the chairmen and mayors of various Northeast provinces. Zhang and Jiang are scheduled to fly to Changchun on the 4th, at which time a portion of financial personnel will return to Changchun. Zhang told the Central News Agency reporter that this trip is to confer with Marshal Malinovsky on the technical aspects of airlifting the National Army to the Northeast and the procedures for taking over the administration of the various provinces.

[United Press, Chongqing, 2nd] According to Chinese reports, the National Army in the Northeast is advancing along the Beining Railway and has reached Dahushan, 180 li west of Shenyang today. It was previously reported that Communist troops were holding out there. In addition, it is rumored that Zhang Xueliang's younger brother, Zhang Xueshi, has sent representatives to the Northeast Security Command in Jinzhou to negotiate surrender. According to the Shih Pao, Zhang Xueshi's troops have entered Shenyang.

[United Press, Chongqing, 2nd] It is reported that the first batch of ground troops of the National Army have landed at the Changchun Airport, preparing to arrange everything so that the National Army can arrive in Changchun by air. However, this news is still awaiting verification.

[United Press, Qinhuangdao, 1st] The Communist Army's "harassment troops" suddenly attacked Haiyang (transliteration), a coal mining town northwest of the US Marine Corps headquarters, on Friday, according to four Chinese government officials. This action is the peak of the Communist Army's week-long obstruction of the National Army's advance towards Shenyang. In addition, the Communist Army has repeatedly sabotaged the railway between Shilong (transliteration) and Anshan and has frequently fired at the National Army defending various key points under the Great Wall. The Communist Army is making every effort to force coal miners to leave the mines. Although production has been slightly affected, the coal mines are operating as usual.

[United Press, Yan'an, 2nd] Zhu De, Commander-in-Chief of the Communist Army, declared today that the Chinese Communist Party has never opposed the landing of the Central Army at various ports in the Nine Eastern Provinces. If the Central Army decides to move into other parts of the Nine Eastern Provinces by air, the Eighteenth Group Army of the Communist Party will have no objection. However, the Communist Party cannot be responsible for any actions taken by the "People's Army" or former troops of Zhang Xueliang within the Nine Eastern Provinces.

### The Communist Party Seizes Territory, Claims Military Power, Breaks Faith, and Abandons Righteousness; Attempts to Divide China into Two; Obstructs the Progress of Surrender Acceptance Work in Various Places

[Reuters, Chongqing, 2nd] Minister Wu of the Central Propaganda Department told this agency's reporter yesterday that the Communist Party has the intention of splitting China into two. Zhou Enlai's remarks (published in the London "News Chronicle" last week) are one-sided and cannot be compared with the facts. When Chairman Chiang met with Mao Zedong in Chongqing on September 2, he suggested changing the Supreme National Defense Council into a political conference of various ministers. Mao Zedong insisted that the Communist Party should participate in the Executive Yuan before the convocation of the National Assembly. Chairman Chiang expressed his willingness to consider this. However, during the subsequent negotiations, the Communist Party did not pay attention to this and instead demanded the right to appoint the chairmen of various provinces in North China and to retain an independent army. Is their intention not to divide China into two? This not only violates the interests of the nation but also contradicts the Communist Party's own slogan of unifying China. The obstacle to the negotiations lies in this, which no Chinese government can accept. While the central government is preparing to reduce the military, the Communist Party is attempting to expand it. The Communist Party originally agreed to submit a plan to the central government for the garrison locations of the Communist Army, but this plan has not yet been submitted. The government has repeatedly urged, but Ye Jianying has not yet come to Chongqing to jointly form a military sub-committee. Their intention is either to adopt a delaying tactic or to break their word. Zhou Enlai pointed out that the Central Army launched an attack first while negotiations were underway, causing a civil war to break out. However, apart from small contacts, large-scale battles only occurred in five places, namely, Zhangcheng District in southern Shanxi. The Central Army recovered this area from the Japanese army on August 19, but the Communist Army attacked and occupied it on September 21. In northern Henan Province, the Central Army intended to accept the surrender of the Japanese army but was attacked by the Communist Army, and two generals were captured. Baotou and Guihua have been repeatedly attacked fiercely by the Communist Army, but the Communist propaganda has never mentioned these two siege battles. Zhou Enlai's allegations did not specify dates or locations, showing his recklessness in making false claims.

### Communist Army in Southern Shandong Fiercely Attacks Lincheng; American Overseas Troops Deploy on the Outskirts of Qingdao; Anticipating Seven Regiments of the Communist Army Returning from Anyang to Daokou and Huaxian

[Central News Agency, A Certain Place in Southern Shandong, 2nd] The main force of the Communist Army gathered in southern Shandong is fiercely attacking the National Army in Lincheng.

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 2nd] According to reports from Shandong received by relevant parties, over 10,000 Communist troops who fled north across the Jiaoji Railway have gathered in Changyi, preparing to take boats at Lejiaping in Yexian to go to the Northeast. In addition, more than 7,000 Communist troops in Laiyang are forcibly conscripting over 10,000 men, carrying ladders, stretchers, explosives, etc., and are active in Jimo, Mashan, Lingshan, and other places, with the intention of attacking Jimo.

[United Press, Qingdao, 2nd] The US military is prepared to spend the winter on the isolated islands here and in various parts of North China. It is increasingly clear that although the Central Army has landed in Qingdao, it may be difficult to restore order in Shandong in the short term. The Communist Army is only 90 li away from here, and Weixian on the Jiaoji Railway has been occupied by them. The US 6th Overseas Division has been deployed to patrol and defend the outskirts of Qingdao and the nearby airfield. The American-equipped Central Army has not advanced far since landing here on the 14th of last month and has not yet contacted the Communist Army.

[Central News Agency, Kaifeng, 2nd] According to military news, over 10,000 Communist troops, totaling seven divisions, have fled from Anyang to Huaxian and Daokou. When passing through Junxian, they thoroughly destroyed the city walls of the county, the solid stone bridge over the Wei River outside the south gate, and the light railway bridge. The majority of the Communist troops are entrenched in the area south of Huaxian city, and a small number are harassing the surrounding areas.

Communist Army Organizes Railway Demolition Team

[Central News Agency, Tianjin, 2nd] Chuan Jize, commander of the first sub-district of the Communist Army's Bohai Military Region, recently selected outstanding personnel from various cadres to form railway demolition teams and railway work teams, engaging in demolition work in sections.

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 2nd] The Ministry of Communications recently received reports from various railway bureaus that the destruction of railways in the latter half of the month was still severe, reaching 71 locations. Tracks were torn up, bridges were cut, station buildings were burned, and telecommunications equipment was destroyed. The Jiaoji Railway suffered the most damage, followed by the Jinpu Railway, the Beining Railway, and the Pinghan Railway. Fifty-four locations have been repaired, and efforts are being made to repair the rest.

[United Press, Guangzhou, 2nd] According to National Army officers, small groups of bandits frequently raid supply stations along the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway. The road is currently guarded by the newly equipped Fifth Army. The bandits' intention seems to be to contain the National Army in the Guangzhou area, preventing them from heading to North China.

Communist Army Constantly Bombs Baotou with Mountain Guns

[Central News Agency, Suiyuan West, 1st] (1) The Communist Army has besieged Suiyuan and Baotou for a month. It is heard daily that 400,000 people besieged in the two places are dying of cold and starvation. (2) The Communist Army has gathered its forces and launched another fierce attack on Baotou. Fierce fighting took place throughout the night of the 28th, 29th, and 30th, without success until dawn on the 1st. This time, the Communist Army had nine mountain guns, launched by the Japanese, which constantly bombarded the city, causing many civilian casualties.

### Editorial: Expectations for the Evaluation Committee

The organizational regulations of the Shanghai Municipal Evaluation Committee have been approved by the Municipal Council. It should be established according to law in a short period. In this time of high prices and difficult livelihoods, of course, we do not ignore this new measure simply because wholesale prices have temporarily returned to normal.

This plan was proposed by the Bureau of Social Affairs. The reason why the Bureau proposed this plan must be because of soaring prices, and the Municipal Government's price control policy is virtually impossible to implement. Therefore, it had no choice but to adopt this countermeasure. Regarding this countermeasure, we should regard it as a kind of progress in the government's price policy, rather than a remedy, and it is a more reasonable method. However, it seems inappropriate to harbor extravagant hopes for the actual effect at this time.

Because the method of evaluation focuses on trade associations. Evaluating the prices of the industry from the standpoint of the industry can naturally avoid many obstructions and obstacles, and the reasons for price increases and decreases are certainly clearer than external judgments. It will never be a matter of merely forcing restrictions, so that the outward appearance can be justified, while in reality, many dark secrets arise. Therefore, we believe that it is a kind of progress.

However, the position of merchants cannot but be based on profit. Their standard can never escape the law of supply and demand. When prices should rise, there is no way to suppress them to make them level; when prices should fall, there is also no way to hinder them to make them high. Therefore, the expectation of stabilizing prices or suppressing prices will probably not be easily achieved.

In our country's business community, there has always been a habit of trade associations discussing matters. This evaluation method is not a new product. Therefore, implementation is not very difficult. However, we must know that the purpose of past trade association discussions was to standardize the market price to avoid competition between the same trades, and it did not contain the meaning of stabilizing or suppressing prices.

The significance of why we welcome this method now has three aspects:

(1) Evaluation is always periodic. Once evaluated, it can have a certain mitigating effect during the period when there are no changes.

(2) Apart from this method, the only other option is to not talk about control. If we talk about control, we will inevitably resort to forced methods.

(3) During the war, the suffering caused by price controls was too deep. Now the central government has canceled various price control laws and regulations. Then, the method to replace it, apart from following the established law of trade association discussions, cannot find a better method.

Therefore, we are quite sympathetic to this new measure. But at the same time, we are willing to make a few more contributions:

(A) The government representatives participating in this committee should respect the opinions of impartial merchants, carefully study the market situation at any time, and never speak official jargon in a monotonous manner, making merchants afraid and unwilling to cooperate.

(B) Price controls will affect the source, sales, and production, so we must start from the big picture and try to avoid unnecessary or bad consequences.

(C) If there is a need for on-site investigation, we believe that it should still be undertaken by merchants, without resorting to all kinds of investigators.

(D) The trade representatives attending the meeting should recognize the government's good intentions, be open and honest, and cooperate frankly in order to achieve the goals of stabilizing prices and stabilizing people's livelihoods. Never hold back thoughts or give too much attention to personal profits.

### After Marshall Arrives in China, I Will Submit a Detailed Report; It is Said That Marshall Will Transfer to London and Moscow

[United Press, Chongqing, 2nd] Well-informed sources here declared today that after General Marshall arrives in Chongqing, he will be able to obtain a detailed report on the situation of the internal conflict in China. When Chairman Chiang meets with General Marshall, Premier of the Executive Yuan Song Ziwen and Minister of Foreign Affairs Wang Shijie will also participate. It is generally speculated that General Marshall will also travel to Yan'an to meet with Communist leaders Mao Zedong and Zhu De.

[United Press, Chongqing, 1st] When US Special Envoy General Marshall arrives in China, the National Government will prepare a detailed report on the Chinese situation and all domestic and foreign disputes to submit to Marshall. Premier Song and Foreign Minister Wang are currently assisting Chairman Chiang in preparing this report. In addition, Minister of Military and Political Affairs Chen Cheng will also participate in discussions with Marshall. General He Yingqin, Commander-in-Chief of the Chinese Army, is also expected to come to Chongqing specifically to participate. As for Marshall's itinerary in China, whether he will visit Yan'an and meet with Communist leaders, there is much speculation here.

[Central News Agency, Washington, 1st, Reuters] The authoritative but unofficial "Army and Navy Journal" stated that the newly appointed special envoy to China, Marshal Marshall, is also tasked with missions to Moscow and London in addition to going to China. It is widely rumored in the army that Marshall's mission is far more extensive than the matter of being stationed in China. He will definitely make a brief stay in London or Moscow on his way to Chongqing or back to the United States from Chongqing to discuss the many issues currently affecting the relationship between the three powers.

[United Press, Washington, 2nd] Diplomatic circles are speculating today that the newly appointed special envoy to China, Marshall, may eventually become the US Secretary of State. The current Secretary of State, Byrnes, will be transferred to be the ambassador to the United Kingdom. At the same time, another rumor is that Marshall will be appointed as an advisor to President Truman. Another rumor is that President Truman was considering reorganizing the State Department at the beginning of his term, but in view of the recent reorganization of the State Department, there are reports that he is quite dissatisfied with Byrnes. The President believes that only those with administrative experience, who are independent of political and diplomatic parties, can bear the heavy responsibility of reorganizing the State Department, and must be highly respected in order to reform the administrative and personnel matters of the State Department with a courageous and impartial attitude. Marshall is highly trusted by President Truman. Truman intends to merge the US Navy, Army and Air Force into a Ministry of Defense and implement universal military training. Therefore, many believe that Marshall may succeed Leahy as Presidential Advisor. It is expected that the President will seek Byrnes' personal opinion before making a final decision.

[Another dispatch] According to Senator George, the newly appointed US special envoy to China, Marshall, may attend the Pearl Harbor Incident Investigation Committee tomorrow to make a statement on the Japanese sneak attack on Pearl Harbor.

### Hurley Collects Evidence and Will Report to the Foreign Affairs Committee

[United Press, Washington, 1st] After US Ambassador to China Hurley resigned, three committees in Congress, namely the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, the House Military Affairs Committee, and the Committee on Un-American Activities, requested that Hurley attend and report. The United States' policy toward China has not yet been announced and may receive an answer as a result of this Hurley resignation incident. A US official said that General Marshall, in addition to implementing the policy announced by the US government, will further explore the root causes of the internal conflict in China in order to make suggestions and change US policy toward China. Soviet commentator Yakolev declared in the Moscow Workers' Party True News today, "Hurley has acted as a mouthpiece for American imperialists, who hope to rule the United States, Asia, and other parts of the world." This is the Soviet Union's first comment on Hurley's resignation.

[Central News Agency, New York, 1st, United Press] New York Post columnist Moore wrote that Hurley's resignation in anger has one consequence: it will prompt the government to publicly declare its policy of supporting the central government of China.

[Central News Agency, Washington, 1st] Hurley is currently preparing to attend the US Congressional Foreign Affairs Committee's investigation hearing and has collected a large amount of evidence regarding former pro-Communist personnel in the US State Department sabotaging the implementation of the State Department's policy toward China. Senator Connally, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said that whether the press can attend and listen to the report still depends on the vote of all members of the committee in three days.

[United Press, Washington, 2nd] The true nature of the evidence collected by Hurley regarding the pro-Communist elements in the former US State Department who sabotaged the State Department's policy toward China will remain secret until it is submitted to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. However, it is rumored that this evidence includes all the official letters between the ambassador to China and the State Department. Senator Willis, a Republican from Indiana, delivered a speech in the Senate criticizing American Far East policy and demanded that the State Department "provide an explanation and carry out a major cleanup."

The Communist Party will soon send a delegation of seven people to Chongqing to attend the Political Consultative Conference. The Central Army's advance into the Nine Eastern Provinces uses three army corps, with two army corps fighting and one army corps as a reserve, totaling 90,000 people. The 15,000 Communist troops besieging Guihua are about the same number as the Central Army inside the city. The Communist troops surrounding Baotou are fewer in number.

### The United States Helps Me Train Sailors to Replace the American Ships Transporting the National Army; Location is in Qingdao; Period is Three Months

[United Press Correspondent with the US Seventh Fleet near the East Nine Provinces, 2nd] Vice Admiral Barbey, Commander of the Seventh Fleet, suggested a few weeks ago that the American ships transporting the Central Army should be replaced by Chinese sailors, so that American sailors could return home for demobilization. Barbey declared again today that the American naval personnel in the Nine Eastern Provinces will begin training Chinese sailors to use amphibious ships on the 10th of this month. The training ground is located in Qingdao, and the training period is three months. The first phase can train 600 soldiers and 60 officers. The purpose of this move is to train Chinese sailors so that they can be deployed on necessary ships and implement the terms of the Japanese surrender.

### Who is Hitting? Who is Being Hit? Fu Zuoyi Sends a Telegram to Guo Moruo

Responding to the Declaration of the Anti-Civil War Conference, Calling on All Circles to Visit Suiyuan to Investigate

[Central News Agency, Gui Sui, 1st] Guo Moruo, Luo Longji, and others convened an anti-civil war conference in Chongqing on the 19th and issued a declaration. After the news reached here, Commander-in-Chief Fu Zuoyi felt deeply and sent a telegram to Guo Luo and others titled "Willing to Echo Against Civil War," stating: "I deeply sympathize with the opposition to civil war. China today absolutely cannot afford to fight, absolutely cannot afford chaos. Everyone abhors civil war and opposes civil war. Is it only you gentlemen who feel this way? But the war continues amidst these calls against civil war. Who exactly is hitting whom? Who fired the first shot of the civil war? Now I, Zuoyi, have a belly full of grievances and wish to explain, hoping to assist in opposing civil war. I have led troops from the Great Wall Resistance against Japan, the Bailing Temple Resistance against Japan, until the Japanese surrender, for a full twelve years. No matter what, you cannot say that my troops did not resist Japan. But some people scold us for not resisting Japan. I don't understand what this means. Suiyuan has no so-called enemy, nor is it acquiring weapons through conscription, nor is it a so-called 'Liberated Area.' Even the Communist Party itself has not mentioned a word about Baotou, Sazhen, Helin, and other places. But their 'Liberated Area,' here, only has officers and soldiers who have resisted Japan for twelve years and compatriots who have suffered for eight years. Our weapons are still just a few broken guns that have been used for twelve years. But this place has become a target of attack, becoming the fuse of the civil war that we all oppose. I have retreated hundreds of miles continuously, from Fengzhen, Jining, Liangcheng, Wuchuan, Helin, Taolin, all the way back to Suibao, while the Communist army has rushed thousands of miles, besieging the two isolated cities of Suibao and attacking them relentlessly. This is the civil war that the whole country unanimously opposes. I am willing to shout 'Oppose Civil War' with you gentlemen, and I earnestly hope and welcome you gentlemen and people from all parties and factions to come to Suiyuan by plane to see who is fighting the civil war, to see the tragic reality that the military, government, and people who have resisted Japan for twelve years are being beaten. Chinese people have always sympathized with the weak, but who is the weak today? Can the weak still fight to the gates of Suibao, fight to Sanbian, fight to Sui'anbei, the base of the resistance against Japan? 'Oppose Civil War,' 'Oppose Civil War.' The military and civilians of Suiyuan have shed thousands of tears and shouted 'Oppose Civil War' until they are hoarse. They shout louder, more purely, but who hears them? Who hears them? What is democracy? What is the opinion of the people? I cannot help but doubt it. If the people had a little opportunity to express their opinions, would the Communist army dare to fight to Suibao, fight to Suixi, Anbei? You gentlemen are cultural leaders, leaders from all walks of life. Your shouts will be broadcast immediately. How happy I would be to hear that. I repeat once again, please invite you gentlemen and people from all parties, factions, and no factions, including Communist Party members, to come to Suiyuan immediately to see who is looting, who is burning and killing, who is raping, who is coercing, who is hitting people, who is being hit, who is driving innocent people to the front lines to die. After seeing these facts clearly, you can shout against civil war more forcefully and effectively. We resisted Japan for twelve years, and after victory, we are forced into the two isolated cities of Suibao, being beaten to death. What should we say? I wish you success in opposing civil war, and good health to you gentlemen."

### Northeast Factories Have Been Emptied

[United Press, Jinzhou, 2nd] According to our agency's photographer, the factories in the Nine Northeastern Provinces were emptied after the end of the war. He has taken photos of this situation on the ground. This situation can be seen everywhere from the Great Wall to Harbin. The various factories are the result of the Japanese's fourteen years of hard work. To restore them, a huge amount of money and a spirit of hard work are indispensable.

[Another Telegram] According to a key figure who received the Northeast, "The most important parts manufactured by foreign countries in factories and hospitals that I have seen were bundled up and taken away by the Russians first. When the Communist army came, they took the rest and destroyed what they could not carry away. Finally, the farmers dismantled all the wood. The Japanese built a large sulfuric acid plant in Jinxi, ranking fourth in the world. It is now unusable. The gasoline plants in Jinxi and Xingxian are also like this. A United Press reporter drove a jeep for 450 miles to a place 150 miles from Shenyang and found only one road that was still usable. All the bridges along the way had been destroyed."

### Rumor That the Soviet Union Urges Iran to Change Cabinet Members, Iranian Prime Minister Prepares to Resign

Possibly Succeeded by Former Pro-Soviet Prime Minister Saltaneh

[Reuters, Tehran, 2nd] Iranian Prime Minister Hakimi will speak to Parliament today, issuing the government's response to the Soviet note. Yesterday, the Iranian Prime Minister had Tehran Mayor Aepuda Hajj resign and appointed the pro-Soviet Nariman, who is currently the Minister of Post and Telecommunications. It is rumored that the Soviet side demanded the change of six Iranian cabinet members and police officers, so the Iranian cabinet may have to be reorganized. The six people are Interior Minister Fashimi, Chief of Staff Alpha, Tehran Military Commander Moghadam, Police Chief Sarabi, Director of Internal Security Feya, and Tehran Mayor Aepuda Hajj. These six people are closely related to former Iranian Prime Minister Dindette, who was anti-Soviet.

[United Press, Tehran, 2nd] It is rumored that Iranian Prime Minister Hakimi has prepared to submit his resignation this week to make way for former pro-Soviet Prime Minister Saltaneh. Most people believe that Saltaneh is a reasonable successor. When this rumor was inquired of the Iranian ambassador to the UK, it was said that he was unaware of it, but the rumored successor is not surprising. Hakimi is suspected to respond today to the Soviet note stating that it refused Iranian troops to go to the northwestern province of Azerbaijan to avoid bloodshed.

Soviet Blockade Continues

[Reuters, London, 2nd] The Tehran correspondent for "World News" stated: The blocked Iranian troops are still gathered on both sides of the road, waiting for Soviet permission to enter the Azerbaijan province. The Soviet blockade line has been extended to Alasen. The situation behind this blockade line is of concern to all parties. If the UK and the US do not stop the Soviet Union's actions in Iran, then civil war in Iran will be difficult to avoid by next spring. The methods used by the so-called Democratic Party are nothing more than two: one is to demand the resignation of government officials such as the Prime Minister and Foreign Minister. If this is rejected, they will launch a military coup; the other is to hold elections in the north and declare autonomy. Then the rest of Iran will inevitably face famine if it does not go to war. Some people firmly believe that the Soviet Union will arrange riots before withdrawing its troops. Once the troops are withdrawn, they can no longer be accused of being involved in the riots. It is heard that arms and Caucasian "tourists" have crossed the Azerbaijani border in large numbers. It is not too late to send an impartial investigation team to investigate the actual situation in northern Iran, otherwise it may be too late.

[Central News Agency, Tehran, 2nd] Reuters: Iranian forces are reinforcing the capital and have occupied all the key strongholds leading to the capital.

[Reuters, Batavia, 2nd] A spokesperson for the Allied General Headquarters broadcast yesterday, stating: Britain does not wish to wage war on the people of Indonesia to restore Dutch rule, nor does the British army intend to occupy all of Java or remain there for a long period.

Three temporary university remedial classes have now been established in Nanjing, Shanghai, and Peiping.

### Tomorrow's Youth Education

— Chen Bochui

What should be the youth education of tomorrow?

In the not-so-distant past, the country's wealth was being consumed by a huge army and military needs—millions upon millions of yuan added up to a dizzying astronomical figure. Following in front of the youth were the grand spectacle of well-equipped modern weapons, and what they heard was the symphony of air raid alarms and bombings. They, either trembling, rushed to the battlefield, or, pale-faced, hid in air-raid shelters... The ogre and the monster have already been realized from fairy tales. War has destroyed the entire country, and what has gone bankrupt is not only the economy, but also wisdom and morality. Tomorrow's youth education must be treated accordingly.

The war is over, and victory brings peace. The country is in urgent need of construction, and young people should be educated in the lovely countryside, the modern cities, the long highways and railways, and the beautiful rivers and mountains, drawing attention and arousing interest. The patriotic service of young people has changed from defending the country and killing enemies to eliminating pests, planting forests, cleaning up the environment, water conservancy projects, and all disaster and emergency services... For the sake of the country's construction, for the sake of a better society, they should be trained to be people with firm determination and enthusiastic work.

Young people must be trained to adapt to the new environment. Due to the shrinking space and the prosperity of science, the world is making rapid progress in the times, and the country cannot stand still because of this. Young people face changes, encounter changes, and must never be shocked by changes, calmly and calmly, paving the way for civilization, and advancing through thorns.

Young people are not only trained to adapt to the new environment, but also must be trained to create a new environment. And this kind of training must reduce emotions and focus more on talents. Even so, in addition to the three R's, a fourth R is needed, that is to say, in addition to reading, writing, and arithmetic (Reading, Writing, Arithmetic), there must be responsibility (Responsibility)—in addition to rich knowledge and skilled technology, inject moral vitamins.

Also, young people must be trained to live in democracy, to have them remember these four freedoms that have been blood-washed; and to learn how to defend freedom, use freedom, enjoy freedom, and cherish freedom. Live freely in a free country.

Young people must work hard and do practical work tomorrow, and are not allowed to dream today. Complete youth education is not only in natural sciences, but also in social sciences; it is not only reading, but also doing; it is not only using the brain, but also using the hands. Mankind evolved from labor, and the world will ultimately belong to the world of workers. Don't forget Learning by Doing, especially in tomorrow's youth education.

The proposal was approved, with a deadline of one week for submission. (2) Charitable organizations that care for women, children, and the disabled, if lacking medical supplies and provisions, are requested to submit a report on their current care situation and plans, along with a budget detailing items and quantities needed, in both Chinese and English, through the Social Affairs Bureau. The proposal was approved, with a deadline of one week for submission. (3) Charitable organizations already planning winter relief efforts are requested to submit a report to the Social Affairs Bureau for record-keeping as soon as possible. The proposal was approved. (4) Charitable organizations with remaining capacity for accommodation are requested to report it for allocation purposes. The proposal was approved. (5) Charitable organizations are requested to report the names and skills of adult refugees to the Social Affairs Bureau for the purpose of organizing work relief programs. The proposal was approved.

### Shanghai Land Registration: Separate Registration Offices Established

The Shanghai Land Administration Bureau has now established three separate registration offices for various land registrations, each responsible for receiving documents. For applications for ownership registration, transfer registration, change registration, other rights registration, and renewal of title deeds, if the land is located in the old Special District One, Zhabei, or Yinxiang District, applications should be made directly to Registration Office One at 66 Zha Pu Road. If the land is located in the old Special District Two or Fa Hua District, applications should be made directly to Registration Office Two at 71 Daxilu Road. If the land is located in Hunan District or Caojing District, applications should be made directly to Registration Office Three at 72 Shangwen Road. Cancellations, preliminary registrations, and objection registrations should be made to Section Two of the Bureau at Madang Road. Furthermore, due to the significant changes in land rights in recent years and the resulting confusion in land records, a special department has been established to handle land tax collection. For real estate outside the registration districts, any transfer of ownership should be applied for directly to Section Two of the Bureau. The Bureau has also set up an inquiry office to answer questions from businesses regarding registration and tax collection procedures.

Also, it is reported that the Bureau has taken over more than 5,000 mu of public land that was illegally occupied or sold by the enemy and puppet regimes. However, only a little over 1,000 mu are properly documented and can be traced, while the remaining 4,000 mu, despite detailed investigation, are still being concealed by unscrupulous individuals and claimed as private property. Citizens are encouraged to report such cases at any time.

### Goods Tax Collected Ad Valorem: Adjusted Monthly

According to a spokesperson for the Shanghai Goods Tax Bureau, the goods tax is collected ad valorem, based on the price. Manufacturers first report their prices, which the Bureau then reasonably assesses based on its own market research. The Ministry of Finance has specifically stipulated that the manufacturer's price should not exceed one-fourth of the market price, as a standard for price assessment. If the manufacturer's price is lower than one-fourth of the market price, it should also be adjusted accordingly, in order to reduce the burden on businesses and the public. The Ministry of Finance has stipulated that this adjustment method be implemented monthly, so that the amount of tax payable for each item will not be excessively high or low. The spokesperson also revealed that, in order to rectify tax collection and safeguard the legitimate interests of honest merchants, the Bureau will work with the police to strictly crack down on privately established small cigarette factories.

### Stratemeyer Announces: U.S. Air Force Achievements in China; Air Force Personnel Returning Home in Succession

General Stratemeyer, Commander of the U.S. Air Force in the China Theater, announced today that, starting from the 1st of this month, the U.S. Air Force Command is extensively repatriating personnel from the Tenth and Fourteenth Air Forces. These two air forces include three flying groups and one transport group, as well as the Air Transport Logistics Command and the Air Transport Group. In total, these organizations comprise 1,600 officers and soldiers.

General Stratemeyer also announced the great tasks completed by these two air forces during and after the war, stating that both air forces are highly decorated and their work is known worldwide. The Fourteenth Air Force, formerly under the leadership of General Chennault, served in the China Theater for three years. The Tenth Air Force, under the leadership of General Davidson, worked in the India-Burma Theater. The Fourteenth Air Force, known as the Flying Tigers, was formally established in Kunming in July 1942 and, together with the Chinese Air Force, drove away stubborn enemies in the sky, achieving brilliant victories, and from then on, our rear areas were no longer threatened by air raids. Despite the shortage of supplies and various difficulties, the Fourteenth Air Force posed a great threat to the Japanese. In the air, they destroyed 1,290 enemy aircraft and possibly destroyed 585. On the ground, they destroyed 1,057 enemy aircraft and possibly destroyed 220, meaning that 2,348 Japanese aircraft were destroyed and 778 were possibly destroyed. At this time, only 464 of our aircraft were destroyed. 2,270,689 tons of Japanese ships were destroyed, 3,779 locomotives were destroyed, 573 bridges were destroyed, and 1,243 trains were destroyed, creating an unprecedented record. In July 1945, General Chennault retired with honors, and the Fourteenth Air Force moved to Baishiyi in Chongqing. They only came to Shanghai to work in October of this year. Under the leadership of General Davidson, the Tenth Air Force began working in the India-Burma Theater in 1942, and was a pioneer in reopening the China-India Highway and building the Stilwell Road. At that time, the command was located in New Delhi, India, and later moved to Calcutta, guarding the "Hump" and ensuring that air transport was not attacked by the enemy. In 1944, this air force transported more than 60 tons of supplies to Burma every day. In the summer of this year, the Tenth Air Force came to China to work, and after the end of the war, it was responsible for military transport, transporting 81,000 Chinese troops in 49 days, while also transporting supplies for 50,000 troops. The team is now commanded by General Hekinberger. The 513th Transport Squadron, between July 1944 and September 1945, transported a total of 223,232 passengers and 41,000 tons of supplies. Later, it also airlifted the entire 94th Army from Shanghai to Ping in 12 days, using C47 and 46 transport aircraft, making it the authority on air transport in this war.

American Soldiers Returning Home Soon

[Special Interview by Our Newspaper] From November 29th to December 10th, the U.S. will send back a gift and a transport plane to the country. The qualifications and reasons for these nine workers returning home are diverse, but most of them are due to their high point accumulation, being over 35 or 38 years old, having served in the military for more than four years, and being surplus personnel in the military. The required point accumulation for this batch is at least 54. According to our reporter's inquiries, the method of obtaining points is varied. For example, serving in the military in the United States mainland without poor records or leaving the job can earn one point per month. Serving well abroad earns two points per month. Having a son or daughter earns twelve points, but limited to three children (i.e., a maximum of 36 points). Other achievements, such as being wounded once, or having special merits once, earn five points.

It is also heard that officers and soldiers will continue to be repatriated to the United States next month, and by the end of January, 6,000 American soldiers will remain in Shanghai. The point accumulation for those returning home next month will be reduced to a minimum of 50. However, officers and soldiers who are necessary to continue their duties will still be transported to Shanghai.

Liquidation Committee Sets Up Office

The U.S. Foreign Liquidation Commission's office in China was officially established here yesterday, with the office located in the Construction Building. The work of the Liquidation Commission is to liquidate, investigate, and dispose of surplus U.S. materials abroad. These materials will be given to U.S. government agencies, the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, U.S. factories, and the Chinese government. Howard, the representative of McKay, the director of the U.S. Foreign Liquidation Commission in Washington, is the chairman of the commission here. The Special Missions Branch of the China Theater is also responsible for the work of the Foreign Liquidation Commission.

### Most Countries in the World Drive on the Right Side of the Road

The Municipal Government announced that, according to central government regulations, from New Year's Day next year, all road traffic in the country will switch to driving on the right side of the road. One of the reasons for this is to conform to the trend in most countries. According to pre-war statistics, 21 countries drive on the right, including the United States, the Soviet Union, France, and Turkey, accounting for seven-tenths of the total number of countries in the world. The countries in the world that drive on the right are the United States, the Soviet Union, France, Turkey, Germany, Italy, Belgium, and Canada, Brazil, Chile, Switzerland, Denmark, Norway, Finland, the Netherlands, Greece, Romania, Portugal, Egypt, Spain, and Persia. The countries in the world that drive on the left are the United Kingdom, Austria, and Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Sweden, Australia, North and South Africa, Argentina, Uruguay, India, and Japan. Now that China has switched to driving on the right, there are 22 countries driving on the right, and only 11 countries driving on the left.

### Pujiang Dong-Dong Line: Ferry Service Resumes

The Pujiang Dong-Dong Line is a cross-river ferry line between Dongmen Road in Puxi and Dongchang Road in Pudong. Both sides are prosperous downtown areas. Before the war, the ferry service was frequent, and the number of passengers was the highest among all lines in the Pujiang River. After the establishment of the Municipal Ferry Company Preparatory Office, it actively planned the restoration of the route. Now, the original pier at Dongmen Road in Puxi has been partially recovered, and the Hongsheng Pier in Dongchang Road in Pudong is being borrowed. It has been decided to restore the route to meet the needs of citizens. Starting from the 1st, ferries have been assigned to operate on the line, with departures every fifteen minutes from 6:00 am to 8:00 pm.

### Large Batch of Telephones: To Be Shipped to Shanghai Soon

In order to meet the needs of citizens, the Shanghai Telephone Company has ordered 900,000 new automatic telephones from the United States. After the news was released, all parties expressed enthusiastic expectations. According to our reporter, these telephones all have six digits, and are expected to appear in the city in March next year, and are planned to be distributed and used quickly. It is heard that this is the first batch of orders, and a second batch will be ordered after they arrive, in order to satisfy the public's eager demand.

### Third War Area Command: Moving to Wuxi Today; Some Personnel Remain in Shanghai

General Tang Enbo, Commander of the Third War Area and Garrison Commander of Nanjing and Shanghai, believes that the surrender mission in the Nanjing-Shanghai area has been completed, and the garrison work should be actively carried out. In order to restore the security and order of all towns and villages along the Nanjing-Shanghai Railway as soon as possible, so that the people can live and work in peace, it has been decided to move the headquarters of the Third War Area Command and the Nanjing-Shanghai Garrison Command to Wuxi, the center of the Nanjing-Shanghai Railway, to facilitate command and coordination. It is learned that, with the exception of the Japanese Residents Management Office, the Prisoner of War Management Office, the Port Command, the Foreign Affairs Office, and the News Liaison Group, the remaining five organizations will remain in Shanghai, and all other organizations will move to Wuxi this morning. All organizations moving to Wuxi will assign personnel to work in Shanghai to maintain contact.

### Strict Suppression of Opium

In order to eliminate opium in Shanghai, the authorities have formulated measures based on central government laws: (1) Using the method of self-renewal and adopting inspection and reporting methods. (2) Those who plant, manufacture, transport, or sell opium are allowed to confess and reform within this year. Those who are addicted to opium must quit before the end of June of the 35th year of the Republic. Opium offenders discovered after April 1st who have not confessed and reformed, and those who are addicted to opium after July, will be sent to military courts and punished according to military law.

### Comrades Association of Martyrs: Elected Responsible Persons

The Shanghai Anti-Japanese War Martyrs Association held its first board of directors meeting on the 1st at 7:00 pm. Chairman Wang Weijun immediately elected Jiang Bocheng, Wang Weijun, Jiang Menglin, Jiang Hao, Mao Sen, Cao Jun, Lv Entan, Wan Tanlin, and Tao Guangchuan as managing directors, with Jiang Bocheng concurrently serving as chairman of the board. Bi Gaokui, Luo Yaxi, and Liu Hanwen were elected as managing supervisors, with Bi Gaokui as the convener. In the Association's director's meeting, Chairman Mao Sen decided that Wan Tanlin would be the executive director, Wang Weijun would be the deputy executive director and concurrently the head of the general affairs group, Zhao Peixin would be the deputy head, Jiang Menglin would be the head of the investigation group, Yang Wenguang would be the deputy head, Yan Zisheng would be the head of the relief group, Ji Zhencang would be the deputy head, Jiang Hao would be the head of the design group, Zhao Yihua would be the deputy head, Zhu Xian would be the head of the editorial group, and Lu Guanliu would be the deputy head.

### A Glimpse of the Japanese in Hongkou Living in Concentration

It's been four years since I last went to Hongkou. After returning from Chongqing, I heard that all the Japanese were confined within the Hongkou district, and I wanted to see the appearance of these "dogs without homes." Yesterday, I specially invited a few friends to take a trip to Hongkou. Unfortunately, it was a day of bitter wind and rain. The Japanese, who usually don't dare to come out much, were even more likely to be hiding at home on this rainy day.

The Japanese residential area in Hongkou includes the area within North Sichuan Road, Wen Road, Zha Pu Road, Tiantong Road, Broadway Road, and the riverside. Japanese people are only allowed to walk within the area, and are not allowed to cross the boundary. Stepping into North Sichuan Road again this time, my mood and spirit were very different from four years ago. In the past, I used to walk with my head down, and suddenly someone would greet me head-on, asking, "Where are you going, to what place?" That kind of situation is no longer there.

The lively scenes of Zha Pu Road and Broadway Road in the past have also disappeared. Japanese shops, foreign firms, and brothels have all been closed. Every Japanese person has a white cloth band on their arm, with the words "Japanese Resident" and the name of their guarantor. There are still many Japanese women wearing clogs and kimonos, and there are also a few who dress very well. At the intersection of Kunshan Road, there are two food stalls with tents. One selling noodle soup is setting up the tent, preparing to do business; the other selling roasted buns is in the midst of brisk business. Several Japanese women and children are waiting for the hot roasted buns to come out of the oven. The person selling roasted buns can also speak a few words of pidgin Chinese. The so-called roasted bun is made by mixing flour and eggs into a batter, with bean paste in the middle, and frying it in a pan with individual holes. Each bun has already risen in price to 3,000 yuan of puppet currency. The person selling roasted buns can earn two or three million yuan of puppet currency a day. When asked about returning home, he sighed and said that he didn't want to go back either. He would rather set up a roasted bun stall in China, but now he can only wait for orders from above. When the time comes to go back, he has to leave. My companion specially found me a translator, and negotiated with a middle-aged Japanese woman to visit her home. The woman was very polite, repeatedly saying, "Small, dirty," and we also repeatedly said in pidgin Chinese: "It's okay." Her home was just a dozen steps away, with a small room. Although crowded, it was kept clean, and the shoes were taken off at the door. She said that they used to live very well, but now she lives with six children in one room, eating and sleeping on the floor. Her husband now makes a living by selling old cloth.

We then ran to a more upscale alley to find a neighborhood chief. The neighborhood chief was quite young and could even speak a few words of pidgin English. He told us that he had more than 30 people living in one house, with more than 20 families. They still pay rent and all expenses, but have no income. Most of the Japanese rely on their previous savings to get by, and after they are used up, they sell old goods and set up small stalls. In addition to food stalls, there are also medicine stalls and other miscellaneous goods stalls.

Finally, we went to the former Japanese Club and the Japanese Residents Association and found a person in charge named Koki Inuta. They were having lunch. Everyone had a large bowl of white rice, covered with a bowl lid, a box of tofu and winter melon, a small dish of pickles, and a cup of tea. Koki Inuta told us very sincerely in not very pure English: "To be honest, I would like to stay and work in China. We all like to cooperate with China, but now everything has to wait for orders from above. We will return to our home country on whatever day there is a ship, and at the same time, for the sake of my wife and children who are at home, I have to return to my old home."

It is said that there are still 70,000 Japanese residents in Hongkou, Shanghai. Each li (neighborhood) or fang (block) has an average of 700 people, and some even have 1,000 people. Most fang or li have a small school with teachers, teaching students in the fang or li. Most of the residents are unemployed, but most do not want to return home. There are about 100 staff members in the Japanese Residents Association, who do not receive salaries. They also want to watch movies, but they can only watch newsreels in the Hongkou area. The only newspaper available is the Reconstruction Daily, published by the Third War Area Command.

We did not want to delay Koki's mealtime, so we stood up and said goodbye. However, Koki was very polite and said that if we needed to know more details in the future, he could introduce a suitable person here to report everything.

On the way back, we all came to a conclusion: that the generosity and great national spirit of the Chinese people can be fully seen in the conversations of the Japanese people themselves. (Mai Tian)

A batch of 2,229 Japanese residents returning to Japan will be concentrated at Hujiang University in Yangshupu before 7:00 am this morning to await inspection. They will board the Meiyo Maru in order at 7:00 am tomorrow morning to return to Japan. The ship is scheduled to leave Qiujiang Wharf tomorrow afternoon.

### Ship Allocation Meeting: Concrete Measures Agreed Upon

The National Ship Allocation Committee, presided over by the Vice Minister of Communications, held a meeting again yesterday morning at 10:00 am. Concrete measures were drafted regarding (1) the overall ship allocation method, (2) the receiving and returning of ships, and (3) the fuel supply method required for ship navigation.

### Catholic Charities: Welcome Archbishop Cai Ning

Archbishop Cai Ning, the Papal Representative to China, recently came to Shanghai to inspect religious affairs. The Shanghai Catholic Charities Assistance Association held a tea party yesterday to welcome him. Cai Ning, Zhang Boda, Zhu Zhiyao, Zhu Kongjia, Xue Zuheng, Ye Qiuyuan, Zhao Erqian, and others attended. Xue Zuheng gave a welcome speech, followed by guidance from Archbishop Cai Ning, who offered much encouragement. It is heard that the Archbishop will stay in Shanghai for more than ten days.

### Robbers Kill for Clothes

Shi Yusheng, the owner of Rongchang Sheng Department Store at 131 Henan Road, was 70 years old and a native of Yixing. At about 6:25 pm yesterday, a customer suddenly came to the store and chose two sets of undershirts and pants and two pairs of woolen socks, totaling 21,800 yuan in legal tender. The customer suddenly pulled out a firearm, took the items, and fled north. Shi Yusheng, the shop owner, chased after him because of the loss of his capital. When he reached the entrance of Jingxing Lane, a small vegetable market on Tiantong Road, the robber turned around and fired a shot, which hit Shi's left temple. He immediately fell to the ground and died. The robber took the opportunity to escape. After receiving the report, the police officers from West Hongkou transported the body to the Bazilu Sanatorium to await a court examination, while tracking down the robber for investigation.

### Jianghai Customs Continues Auction of Perishable Goods in Warehouses; Procedures Same as Last Time

Since its implementation, the Jianghai Customs' warehouse inspection work has already completed inspections of over ninety warehouses, with active progress continuing. A batch of perishable goods from the warehouses will be auctioned off today at the customs wharf. These are all small items, such as biscuits, salted meat, and dozens of bags of sugar left over from the Shanghai auction. The auction procedures are exactly the same as last time.

The Customs, after completing the inspection of a warehouse, not only affixes Jianghai Customs seals to take it over but also dispatches Customs tax police for protection. The number of tax police on duty has exceeded two hundred. These tax police are directly commanded and dispatched by Mr. Nie Pu Le, the American Chief Secretary of the Customs.

The total number of warehouses sent by the Disposal Bureau is 470. When inspecting these warehouses, the Customs must directly contact the original receiving institutions and send personnel to assist in the work. Currently, the total number of warehouses inspected is still less than one-fifth, so it will take time to complete all inspections.

### Discount on Flat-Priced Cloth

According to the person in charge of the Enemy and Puppet Property Disposal Bureau in the Shanghai District, the third batch of flat-priced cloth is about to be sold out. The fourth and fifth batches will be successively sold at flat prices by various companies. Starting from the sixth batch, the patterns of the cloth will be changed, the quantity will be increased, and the price will be further reduced.

### Deadline for Building on Vacant Land

In order to alleviate the housing shortage and rectify the city, the Municipal Government believes that houses destroyed in previous wars should be built as soon as possible to restore the city's appearance. It has instructed the Land Administration Bureau to draft "Measures for Limiting the Time for Construction on Vacant Land in Prosperous Areas of Shanghai," to be reviewed and promulgated jointly with the Public Works Bureau.

### Minsheng Company Vessels: Allocation of Routes for Each Line

Before the war, Minsheng Steamship Company operated on the Yangtze River with remarkable achievements. During the war, it risked maintaining waterway transportation in the rear under difficult circumstances, resulting in more than ten ships being sunk by Japanese aircraft, exceeding its current total tonnage and causing enormous losses.

Sailing Vessels

The company currently has more than eighty ships of various sizes, but their tonnage is very small. The largest is over two hundred tons, and the smallest is only over twenty tons, which is less than the tonnage lost when ships were sunk during the war. The vessels currently sailing on the lower reaches of the Yangtze River include *Minzu*, *Minquan*, *Minhe*, *Min* [missing character], *Mingui*, *Minlai*, *Min Su*, *Minxi*, *Minxian*, *Minben*, and *Minzheng*, a total of over ten ships. The latter two recently had accidents in the upper reaches and are being rescued. There are also *Min* [missing characters].

Route Allocation

The current routes are mainly divided into three sections: the lower reaches of the Yangtze River (Shanghai-Yichang section), the middle reaches (Yichang-Chongqing section), and the upper reaches (Chongqing-Xufu section), as well as the Chongqing-Hechuan line on the Jialing River. The various lines in the upper reaches are only suitable for small, shallow-draft vessels. In addition, there are small river routes, mainly to connect railway and highway transportation.

Ordering Foreign Vessels

The company is currently planning to order new vessels and develop coastal shipping services, in addition to maintaining operations along the Yangtze River. It also plans to participate in the north-south ocean shipping lines. One sunken vessel purchased from Taikoo Company before the war was towed to the rear during the war and bombed by enemy aircraft several times. It has now been towed to Shanghai and is being repaired at the Jiangnan Shipyard. Once completed, it will be able to participate in coastal shipping lines. Regarding ordering new vessels, which is related to the development of shipping services, foreign exchange guarantees are expected to be obtained from the government to order new vessels from the United States and Canada respectively. It is said that the quantity is very large, and the future of shipping services is promising.

Allocation of Vessels

The company suffered heavy losses during the war, and its main vessels were bombed and destroyed. Therefore, it hopes that the government will allocate a portion of the enemy and puppet vessels and dock materials seized to compensate for the losses. It also hopes to establish a complete shipyard in Shanghai. Because [missing characters] (machine factory) equipment is poor, it can only build small ships of one hundred tons, mainly for repairs, and cannot establish a dock. As the company's focus shifts to Shanghai in the future, it will definitely need larger-scale equipment.

### Local Briefs

Starting today, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Bureau's Shanghai-Ningbo fares are: Special Class, 550 yuan; First Class, 5,750 yuan; Second Class, 3,950 yuan; Third Class, 2,600 yuan; Fourth Class, 1,900 yuan, including meals.

The second training session of the Police Training Institute of the North China Railway Administration Committee of the Ministry of Communications has begun, with more than 500 police officers being recruited and trained.

### Weather Forecast

Over the Yellow Sea, sunny and cold, wind direction variable.

Shanghai area, cloudy, moderate northwest and northeast winds.

Over the East China Sea, cloudy, moderate northeast and east winds.

Yesterday's lowest temperature was 45.3 degrees, and the highest was 48.9 degrees.

### Social Service: Reforming Social Psychology; Urgent Need to Revitalize Morality

— Qinsheng

Starting from the fifteenth and sixteenth years of the Republic of China, after the Communist Party mixed into the Kuomintang, young and ignorant party members, without questioning the truth, insisted on demolishing temples and overthrowing the old ethics, leading to the terrible phenomenon of sons wanting to kill their fathers and brothers wanting to kill their brothers, and students wanting to insult their teachers. This evil trend has not diminished. After the War of Resistance, it gradually evolved into a situation where some intellectuals took pride in selling out the country and being puppet officials, not only demanding money to the death but also taking it as the sole purpose of being a puppet official, but also considering it a right to be enjoyed. They did not care whether it harmed the country or the people and had no concept of "Do not look at what is contrary to propriety" or "Take only what is right, and people will not resent you for taking it." They even regarded the ancient teaching of "Wealth and honor obtained unrighteously are like floating clouds to me" as nonsense. I remember when I was teaching in elementary school, all schools across the country uniformly used "Propriety, Righteousness, Integrity, and Shame" as the goal of moral education, but school teachers and education administrators at all levels never emphasized its implementation. Although the four characters "Propriety, Righteousness, Integrity, and Shame" were displayed in prominent places, they were mostly regarded as decorations. As for the virtues that Dr. Sun Yat-sen believed everyone should possess, such as "Loyalty, Filial Piety, Faithfulness, Love, Benevolence, Righteousness, Harmony, and Peace," they were also considered outdated and abandoned. Therefore, once the Japanese invaders entered the area, traitors and puppets rose up, and the local people suffered from the unrestrained poison of traitors and puppets. Even the most eloquent pen could not describe even one-tenth of it. The reason for this is that the morality of the general public has been destroyed. If we do not revitalize it now, we will not be able to form a society. I recently read an article by Mr. Jiping, "Areas Recovered Urgently Need to Promote the Movement to Revitalize Morality," which struck a chord with me, so I briefly express my humble opinion to prove that revitalizing morality cannot be delayed.

### Improving Trolley Transportation

— Yongyu

Currently, the only public transportation in this city is trolleybuses. Because the number of trolleybuses is small, everyone feels that it is difficult to travel! Recently, I have been taking the Route 2 trolleybus from Jing'an Temple Station to the Polo Ground around 8:00 AM every morning and taking the trolleybus from Nanjing Road Bund to Hart Road around 8:00 PM. From west to east, there used to be a stop at the intersection of Avenue Road and Hart Road, but in recent days, some trolleybuses have passed this stop (when there were not many passengers in the car) without stopping. Recalling one Sunday afternoon last week around 1:00 PM, more than ten trolleybuses passed this stop without stopping, causing the number of people waiting for the bus to increase, and passengers waited for half an hour without being able to get on the bus, wasting valuable time and delaying office hours. Also, around 8:00 PM, sometimes trolleybuses heading west from east (with not many people in the car) do not stop at the Polo Ground Station, and it has been found that the car doors are not closed properly while the trolleybus is speeding. This matter is related to the safety of citizens. As for the Route 2 trolleybus, it is said that the last trolleybus from the Bund is scheduled to depart at 9:00 PM every day, but often there is no trolleybus after 8:45 PM, and there is no indication of whether there is a trolleybus in the evening, causing passengers to wait for a long time and not be able to get on the bus. In order to facilitate the travel of all citizens and help the working class solve the problem of transportation, it is necessary to save valuable time and improve work efficiency. I think that from west to east every morning, it is hoped that extra trolleybuses will be added from 7:30 AM to 10:00 AM, and from east to west every evening, extra trolleybuses will also be added from 4:30 PM to 7:00 PM. At the same time, the French Concession trolleybuses reportedly enter the factory as late as 10:00 PM every night, while the English Shanghai Electric Construction Company's Route 2 trolleybuses stop at 9:00 PM. It is hoped that for the convenience of travelers, it will also be extended by one hour to 10:00 PM. Also, the daily trolleybus operating schedule, that is, when it starts in the morning and when it ends in the afternoon, is hoped to be clearly announced in the trolleybus. It is best if all trolleybuses have entered the factory at night, it should be indicated by lights at each station so that passengers are aware. In order to adjust the trolleybus passengers' sometimes crowded and sometimes empty conditions, the distance and speed of each trolleybus should be adjusted at any time. It is hoped that the trolleybus company authorities will pay close attention to the above opinions.

### Seeking Lost Children

Chun Qiu (Spring and Autumn)

### Farewell, Chongqing

— Zhao Qingge

I am about to leave Chongqing, and I feel a sense of reluctance. These few days, I have been tidying up, and my heart is slightly at ease. Two or three poor and close friends have gathered travel expenses for me, which stirs up all sorts of feelings in me! At the same time, I received a letter from my Ninth Aunt, who, in addition to encouragement, said, "Attached is ten thousand yuan to express my humble intentions." After reading it, I could not help but weep at my desk. What do I deserve to receive such high regard? I can only tell her wholeheartedly and sincerely: "I accept the kindness of the ten thousand yuan, but I will still return the ten thousand yuan to you." It's not that I don't need it; it's that I know she needs it too. I am walking away aimlessly, and I can only struggle on aimlessly! She has seen me endure the hardships of the eight-year War of Resistance, so she can exhort me to maintain this spirit. That's right, I know how to love myself, and I know how to respect the expectations of those who love me. As long as I live in this world for one day, I will cherish myself for one day and not fail the education my parents gave me, nor will I fail the appreciation of my friends! I ask nothing of the world; I only wish to be a "person" in the future, freely, independently, and uprightly.

In the past eight years, I have not gained anything, but I have gained two or three close friends among the newly acquainted friends in many wars. This must be considered my greatest gain. In addition, I have seen all kinds of people and all kinds of things. If life is learning, then I can be said to have a little understanding of the learning of these eight years, and it is enough to teach me for the rest of my life, so that I understand that I must be vigilant at all times in the future.

I have lived in Chongqing for almost seven years. These seven years have been a torment. I have aged a lot. I don't care about my physical aging; I am saddened by my spiritual aging! In the past seven years, I have endured infinite and profound pain. Why? For the War of Resistance. Now that the War of Resistance has been won, my pain is still winding around me like a poisonous snake. I don't know when I will be able to stop hurting? When will I have a truly happy day?

I remember when I first arrived in Chongqing, it was a foggy season; now, when I leave Chongqing, it is also a foggy season. The fog has blurred my vision for seven years! When I first came, I had a feeling of excitement; now, when I leave, I am filled with regret. I hope to break out of the fog circle from now on and breathe fresh air and peaceful air freely from now on!

After I leave, I will not forget the mountains and rivers of Chongqing, the flowers and plants that bloom all year round in Chongqing. I will miss Beibei, the "Bamboo Hut" in Beibei where I lived for four years. I will leave my longing with a group of good friends in the rear, and I will always think of Wen and Dudu.

Dudu has been especially affectionate with me these past few days. This child seems to understand human affairs. He probably wants me to have more memories of the pain of remembering him? All day long, he doesn't want to leave me, calling out "Second Aunt" repeatedly. He is a child less than twenty months old. His emotions actually restrained my emotions. For him, I hope the airline will notify me to postpone the flight, but I am afraid it is impossible. I must leave on the 28th. I can only hope that he will come east to the banks of the Chun Shen River soon so that I can hug him again and hear him sweetly call "Second Aunt," "Second Aunt!"

My heart is beating so hard that I don't know what to say with the pen. Let's end this passage of life in Chongqing hastily. There are still many people and things worth remembering, but I can only leave them to be recalled and supplemented later.

Farewell, Chongqing! Farewell, a group of good friends left in Chongqing, farewell Wen, farewell, dearest Dudu.

### Today on the Middle Reaches of the Yangtze River

— Xie Bingying

I have returned to the middle reaches of the Yangtze River from the upper reaches of the Yangtze River. These famous three towns have always been the head of central China and the heart of China. Like a hero on a battlefield, he has shouldered many great battles; during the War of Resistance, he shouldered an iron-like responsibility. Now, I see his heroic posture again. The Yellow Crane Tower still overlooks the surrounding area, and Egret Island is still openly expanding. I believe even more that China's revival and progress will require him to take on even greater responsibilities!

But friends, seven years of occupation have wounded him. Not only physically, but also with heavy scars. Even spiritually, seven years of poison have made him weakened and decadent. The most obvious thing is that I have been in Wuhan for many days, and I can't buy a book, nor can I see a book. You can imagine that in recent years, the cultural life of Wuhan has been too miserable. People are like machines that eat and make feces, without any spiritual life. Naturally, "no books at all" may be an exaggeration, but I believe that formal books existed in the past, but as times changed, the owners of the books hid them all. In fact, these books are worse than none, but I also believe that there are collectors of good books, but there are too few. Even the good books collected were taken away by the enemy long ago.

Now there are many newspapers, and there is no lack of news from the Central News Agency's telegrams, but the manuscripts for the supplements are a big problem. Local writers who can come forward are as rare as phoenix feathers and unicorns. It is difficult to get articles from the rear to supplement them. Those of us who edit supplements are at a loss. During the war, there was a "rear service department," and there was no worry about ammunition; at present, when things are not connecting smoothly, where is our "rear service department"!

I hope that Wuhan, like a sand dune, can quickly produce water and grass. I not only hope, but also sincerely pray!

### Visiting the Martial Marquis Shrine in Mian County

— Lao She

Still so detached today,
The Martial Marquis Shrine washed by sparse cypress trees.
Three parts unfinished, the virtuous minister's ambition,
A memorial should pity the mediocre master's teacher!
The Han clothing and crown remain after hundreds of calamities,
The Central Plains' flames of war resemble those of that time;
To exhaust one's life in the same liver and gall,
The banner to quell invaders spreads throughout the country!

### Writing

— Wu Renzhi

Xin Qiji's poem: "When young, I did not know the taste of sorrow. I loved to climb the tower, I loved to climb the tower, composing new verses to force myself to express sorrow. Now that I have fully known the taste of sorrow, I want to speak but stop, I want to speak but stop, but I say, 'It is a good autumn, the weather is cool.'"

This poem can be said to have satirized shallow and good verse composers to the fullest. Composing verses does not necessarily require sorrow, but general verses are always about sorrow. Even the "climbing the tower" of young people is clearly without sorrow but they just want to compose verses, "forcing themselves to express sorrow." This is a very timely argument. But after "fully knowing the taste of sorrow," why bother to "want to speak but stop" and laugh it off by saying "It is a good autumn, the weather is cool"? The worldliness of Chinese people is always somewhat incomprehensible.

In fact, composing long and short lines is like this, and writing is no different. If you live without any feelings and force yourself to write, you will inevitably write without content and say nothing of substance. Even if you have something to say, you will inevitably write about groaning without illness, and your words will not hit the point. But those who live with feelings may not have to "want to speak but stop" and laugh it off by saying "The weather is really nice today." Unless in a teahouse in the countryside, where there is a sign saying "No discussion of state affairs here." But now, aren't there no such places anymore?

### Swallows [plus one chapter]

— Shi Jimei

The swallows have gone. It says it wants to return to the South; that warm south is its home.

Little swallow, I will not complain to you, because who doesn't love his own home?

But why did you leave in such a hurry? Couldn't wait to appreciate the late-blooming chrysanthemums and see them appreciating their own beauty. You have seen all the peonies, orchids, and osmanthus flowers here... enjoyed the spring flowers and autumn moon, the warm mountains and beautiful waters, you have had hundreds and thousands of times of washing... Why? Why this time in such a hurry?

Could it be that you are also like those vulgar people, who can only share glory and wealth and cannot share sorrow?

Ah! Swallows, why don't you speak?

Dark night, dark heart, dark dreams... I dreamed he came back, still wearing the clothes he wore when he left, and there was no medal on his clothes.

I clearly remember that he died gloriously on the battlefield. Could it be that all the unnamed heroes are destined to be like this?

So I complained naively: "You fight, you die in battle, it turns out to be for others to live in peace and wealth!"

"Don't say that," he interrupted me and taught me sternly. "We are the masters of China."

"But there is not a single piece of land on the ground that belongs to you," I was still a little upset. "You don't even have a grave or a tombstone."

"You know, our graves are not on the ground, but in the hearts of everyone." That clear voice seemed to resound throughout the endless space and infinite time.

I was silent and gradually realized. Our graves are not on the ground, but in the hearts of everyone...

Chronicles from the Pen

### Feelings About Food

— Wang Tiran

People who are full and warm all day long do not know what hunger is. This is why rich people have to take tonics to help digestion, because they only suffer from eating too much and not from not eating enough.

But in times of great turmoil, when the entire nation is resisting for survival and independence and the entire society has to struggle to continue living, resources are scarce and supplies are difficult. Most people have no choice but to tighten their belts and reduce expenses. This is wartime life. However, it is still possible to reduce clothing, but reducing food is a major problem. People in Shanghai, who are used to eating several large bowls of white rice, find it difficult to find a full meal when rice sells for two million yuan a picul. If you don't eat, you will be hungry. When you are too hungry to think, you can swallow anything, such as corn flour, wheat grits, or broad bean flour. I think there must be many people who still have not forgotten this taste of hunger.

Indeed, the taste of hunger is not pleasant, but after a long period of hunger, one can develop a habit of rapid digestion, a light abdomen, and no stagnation or indigestion. This is something that cannot be obtained in times of peace and satiety. At the same time, it can also be seen that "It is a small matter to starve to death" is not a false saying. To avoid being among the hungry, it is not necessary to lose integrity.

However, it is precisely because of the lack of fullness in the past that we feel the excess of today. After the victory, restaurants and taverns are filled with banquets every night, and each meal can cost more than ten thousand gold. To those who have been starving for a long time, this is too good and too abundant. We don't know if today's guests at grand banquets all have exceptionally good stomachs, or if they have been withered for too long and must quickly eat more oily food?

Commercial News

### Weekly Financial and Commercial Trends

— Chongbo

Finance: Last week in this city, financial markets experienced abundant liquidity. The daily interest rate on one thousand yuan stabilized at three jiao, while the unofficial interest rate continued to decline from one jiao six fen to one jiao three fen. Merchants gradually showed a tendency to favor currency over goods. The price of gold bullion fluctuated erratically due to rumors of free foreign exchange trading and stimulation from international news, hovering around the 800,000 yuan mark. The highest price was 820,000 yuan on Tuesday, and the lowest was 755,000 yuan on Thursday. Ultimately, the market closed at 777,000 yuan, a decrease of 38,000 yuan compared to the previous Saturday. Taels of silver remained stable at 650 yuan each, while silver coins rose to 460 yuan each, an increase of 30 yuan compared to the previous week. Foreigners continued to purchase them in small amounts, with approximately three silver coins being exchanged for slightly less than one U.S. dollar. The price of U.S. dollars declined from 1,380 yuan to 1,308 yuan due to importers and yarn factories taking a wait-and-see attitude in anticipation of the listing of foreign exchange trading. This was a decrease of 22 yuan compared to the previous week. The price of Hong Kong dollars increased because of the resumption of shipping between Shanghai and Hong Kong, with influential parties buying them. Old currency was priced at 225 yuan and new currency at 72 yuan. Two months ago, local investors purchased a large quantity of new Hong Kong dollars with counterfeit currency totaling 10,000 yuan. When the announcement was made that the new Hong Kong currency would be abolished, the price plummeted to over 1,000 yuan on the 1st and 2nd of the month, resulting in significant losses at the time. However, the current exchange rate between legal tender and counterfeit currency allows for substantial profits.

Securities: The registration of various Chinese securities exchange brokers is complete. In the coming spring, public bonds, Chinese stocks, and foreign stocks will be launched simultaneously. Public bonds, especially unified bonds, are the easiest to deploy and are excellent trading targets. Furthermore, there is speculation that new currency will be used to repay them in the future. As a result, Class C bonds with a face value of 100 yuan reached a peak of 580 yuan on Thursday, a premium of 480 yuan. Finally, the securities dealers closed out their long positions with profits, returning to 300 yuan (Class A) to 525 yuan (Class C), still a significant increase of 102 yuan to 225 yuan compared to the previous week. With Chinese stocks gaining legal status and the prospect of widespread circulation, speculative funds returned to the stock market, and both popular and less popular stocks became active. Large stocks, such as Wing On Textile, were priced at 540 yuan, an increase of 120 yuan compared to the previous week, while small stocks, such as King Fook, were priced at 31 yuan, an increase of 8.5 yuan. Foreign stocks were also boosted by news of business resumption, with buyers enthusiastic. Ewo Cotton Mill rose by 220 yuan to 1,680 yuan. The entire securities industry is showing signs of vitality due to the official resumption of business in the coming spring and the internal appointment of Du Yuesheng as its leader.

Goods: Regarding commodities, the market price is gradually decreasing because of the resumption of maritime transport, with ships arriving one after another carrying wheat, cotton, oil, sugar, caustic soda, and pharmaceuticals. However, cotton yarn prices remain firm due to demand from inland buyers during the winter season, with brisk sales in local stores. Analytically speaking, rice prices have fallen by a large margin of 10,000 yuan due to news that the relief agency's indica rice and the grain administration's Wuhu rice, each amounting to 500,000 dan, are being shipped to Shanghai. The prices settled at 7,500 yuan to 9,500 yuan, a further decrease of 500 yuan to 1,000 yuan compared to the previous week. It is rumored that three ships of American wheat, amounting to 300,000 shi, have arrived, and all Shanghai flour mills have resumed operations, producing more than 20,000 bags of flour per day. Additionally, over 60,000 bags of relief flour have been shipped from San Francisco, causing the price to soften by 150 yuan, with No. 1 flour priced at 3,300 yuan and No. 2 flour at 2,950 yuan. The transaction of miscellaneous grains such as soybeans, corn, red beans, and raw peanuts were calm, with each falling by 100 to 200 yuan. Edible oil prices have fallen as supplies from Qingdao and Bengbu arrive continuously, with raw oil and bean oil each falling to 21,000 yuan, and Bengbu goods falling to as little as 19,000 yuan. Sugar prices have stagnated due to the customs auctioning off warehouse stocks, and the successive shipments of Xinghua sugar and Hong Kong sugar to Shanghai. Domestically produced red and white sugar are priced at 50,000 yuan, while imported red and white sugar are priced at 60,000 yuan, each a decrease of 10,000 yuan compared to the previous week. Not much Anhui tea has arrived. Local stores and Suzhou buyers are strongly interested in tea. Keemun black tea has risen to 36,000 yuan, and roasted green tea has also reached 26,000 yuan. The price of raw cotton has fallen due to hints of a weak American cotton market. Large and medium-sized American cotton fell from 85,000 yuan to 70,000 yuan per 120 jin dan, Tongzhou cotton fell from 67,000 yuan to 57,500 yuan, and Huoji cotton fell from 45,000 yuan to 41,000 yuan. Yao cotton for delivery in Shanghai is only 42,000 yuan. Therefore, some people in the cotton industry are bartering 11 dan of cotton for one bale of 20-count cotton yarn from textile factories. In fact, one bale of yarn uses 440 jin of raw cotton, indicating that textile merchants have been making substantial profits recently. As a result, half of the more than one million spindles in Chinese-owned yarn factories across the city are competing to spin yarn. The government has also taken over enemy yarn factories and formed the China Textile Construction Company, with an investment of one billion yuan. Cotton yarn is still being sought by merchants from various regions to satisfy the long-suppressed demand during the winter season after years of war. Fine yarn has risen by another 80,000 to 120,000 yuan, while coarse yarn has fluctuated by 10,000 to 20,000 yuan. 42-count Blue Phoenix old yarn spun from American cotton is sold for 1.38 million yuan, almost 10 taels and two big bars of gold. It should be noted that the pre-war ratio was three bales of yarn equal to one bar of gold. Warehouse stocks of cotton cloth are being released successively, with plain cloth and colored cloth each falling by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan. 12-pound Dragon Head plain fine cloth sells for 28,500 yuan, while Chuji shirting, which is dyed after processing, still sells for 55,000 yuan, more than double the price. Raw silk transactions are lackluster. High-grade silk has softened to 1 million yuan per dan, while Jili silk has fallen to as little as 490,000 yuan. Rayon alone has rebounded to 570,000 yuan for 120-count Tianqiao brand due to demand from silk factories. Fuel: Goods are arriving from both the north and south coasts. The first batch of Vietnamese Hongji coal arriving in Shanghai has further stimulated sentiment. The price of Yangquan lump coal has plummeted to 320,000 yuan per ton, a sharp drop of 100,000 yuan compared to the previous week. Coal balls have also fallen by 500 yuan, with burnable substandard goods selling for 1,500 yuan. Firewood is arriving in abundance by land and water, falling by another 200 to 300 yuan. Pine and mulberry firewood have fallen to as little as 1,450 yuan per city dan. Kerosene is being relisted. The Asia Asiatic Petroleum's Monk Hat brand is falling from 15,000 yuan to as little as 14,500 yuan per case of approximately 30 jin. Cigarettes: Although Yongtaihe is distributing goods, the price has rebounded due to the significant drop in the previous week. 50,000 Great Britain brand cigarettes have risen by 75,000 yuan to 725,000 yuan. Soap prices have risen by 1,000 yuan despite the news that low-priced sales have not satisfied the needs of the public and that Annan caustic soda is arriving in Shanghai. 120-piece boxes of Gu Ben brand sell for 15,000 yuan. Foreign caustic soda has arrived, with each 300 kg piece gradually falling to 280,000 yuan, a significant drop of 300,000 yuan compared to the previous week. Foreign medicines: Orders can now be placed for foreign goods. Quinine has fallen by another 6,000 yuan per 1,000 pills, to 26,000 yuan. White printing paper has fallen by 1,000 yuan per ream due to the opening of naval warehouse stocks, to 16,500 yuan. Overall, with the resumption of maritime transport, there is a trend of gradual decline in commodity prices.

### The Cotton Spinning Industry in Shanghai Before and After the War

— Xuepeng

In the past, both Britain and Japan used cotton textile exports to establish their industrial foundations. From 1935 to 1939, the average annual value of Japanese cotton textile exports to South Africa, India, South America, and the South Seas Islands was 400 million U.S. dollars. Now that the enemy has surrendered and the enemy's cotton textile factories in China have been taken over, they are being restarted successively. In addition, cotton textiles from Taiwan, Shanghai, Korea, and other places also need to be supplied by our country. If our country's cotton textile industry can replace its position, then the annual export revenue will be even more considerable. Recognizing this, the government has formulated the Articles of Association of the Textile Construction Company, designating the three provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui as the Sixth District, and is actively managing them to promote development. However, due to convenient procurement and sales and developed transportation, our country's cotton textile industry has mostly concentrated in commercial ports, especially Shanghai as the central hub. Therefore, the general situation of Shanghai's cotton textile industry before, during, and after the war is described below.

Before the war, there were 65 cotton textile factories in Shanghai, 31 of which belonged to Chinese merchants, 30 to Japanese merchants, and 4 to British merchants. There were 2,667,000 spindles, 452,000 thread spindles, and 30,000 looms. The percentages are as follows:

Spindles Thread Spindles Looms

Chinese Merchants 41.78% 13.12% 29.12%

Japanese Merchants 49.92% 52.30% 57.50%

British Merchants 8.30% 24.58% 13.38%

The average monthly output was 75,867 bales of yarn and 1,422,900 bolts of cloth. Among them, Chinese merchants produced the most cotton yarn, while Japanese merchants produced the most cotton cloth, and British merchants produced the least.

Yarn Cloth

Chinese Merchants 59.53% 22.28%

Japanese Merchants 36.27% 75.08%

British Merchants 4.20% 2.64%

When the War of Resistance broke out, Shanghai was the first to bear the brunt. Factories in the suburbs were either destroyed by artillery fire or forced to stop work. When the January 28th Incident broke out, all four British factories were confiscated by the enemy. In addition, the enemy and puppet regime's control was extremely strict, raw materials were exhausted, and production plummeted. In 1943, the average monthly output of cotton yarn and cotton cloth from Chinese merchants' factories was only 1,942 bales of yarn and 24,845 bolts of cloth.

The cotton used in cotton textile factories is divided into Chinese cotton and foreign cotton. Foreign cotton is mostly imported from India, the United States, and Egypt. Through the government's efforts, the total output of Chinese cotton before the war reached 14 million dan. According to customs reports in 1938, as much as 2,732,000 dan were exported. However, since 1939, most of the cotton fields in the war zone have been abandoned, and cotton production has decreased significantly. In 1937, the total cotton production in the three provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui, which is now the area of the Sixth Cotton Spinning District, was 2.8 million dan, of which Jiangsu produced the most, accounting for 75%. Therefore, after the cotton textile factories in Shanghai were controlled or forced to stop work by the enemy and puppet regime, the cotton-producing areas such as Changshu, Wuxi, and Nantong switched to local spinning and weaving due to the low price of cotton and the high price of cotton textiles. Some textile industries also planned to set up small yarn factories in the raw cotton producing areas. Most of the simple weaving factories and handmade weaving factories in Shanghai were also established at this time. In total, there were 115 small yarn factories with 115,532 spindles and 803 cloth factories with 21,324 looms. The average monthly output was 9,012 bales of yarn and 14,300 bolts of cloth.

With the victory of the War of Resistance and the return of spring, the cotton textile factories operated by the enemy and puppet regime were taken over by the government and actively restarted. Before the war, the Japanese yarn factories had a total of 1,327,632 spindles, 347,608 thread spindles, 48,000 wool spindles, 12,604 ramie spindles, and 18,553 looms. Due to war damage and the enemy's voluntary dismantling, one-quarter was lost. According to a report on November 24, 19 enemy factories had been taken over and started operations, with 193,000 spindles and 3,870 looms in operation. 30 privately-owned cotton textile factories have started operations, and small yarn factories and simple handmade cloth factories in various places have also resumed operations. The statistics of the spindles, thread spindles, and looms of the factories taken over and the private factories are listed below:

Looking at the table above, compared with the factories taken over, that is, the current state-owned cotton textile factories, the private factories have more spindles and looms. Therefore, if the government wants to take over the enemy's past position in the cotton textile industry and replace it, using export revenue as the foundation for industrial development, these few spindles and looms are not enough. It is still necessary to actively develop and cooperate with private factories to support them, so that they can move forward together to achieve success.

### Shanghai Chamber of Commerce Convened Discussions with Various Industries

Capital Issues as a Focus of Discussion

[Special Dispatch from This Newspaper] The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce convened a meeting of the standing committees of the various industry association reorganization committees at 2:00 PM on the 2nd. 182 people attended, and most of the standing committees of the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce were present. Representatives from the Municipal Party Committee, the Municipal Government Garrison Headquarters, and the Bureau of Social Affairs were invited to attend and provide guidance. Detailed discussions were held on issues such as strengthening the organization of industry associations, expediting member registration, stabilizing prices, coordinating labor and management, and winter security. Zhang Kebang, the section chief representing the Bureau of Social Affairs, expressed the authorities' determination to handle industrial and commercial registration. Regarding the capital column in the registration form, he said that those filling out the form could handle it with the freedom to deliberate. However, after discussion at the meeting, it was considered that the freedom to deliberate on the capital seemed too unstandardized. In the end, it was decided that all industries should temporarily fill out the original amount of legal tender capital before the 26th year [1937]. After the current book capital is sorted out, the application for correction will be made. First, the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce will submit it to the competent authorities for record, stating that the amount of capital will not be used as a standard when levying income tax in the future. It is heard that there is still no concrete way to sort out the book capital of industry and commerce. The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce's Industrial and Commercial Laws and Regulations Committee is planning to send letters to various industry associations to solicit opinions, and then conduct a detailed review before making recommendations to the government.
