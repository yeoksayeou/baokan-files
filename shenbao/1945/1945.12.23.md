### Mayor Xiong Unofficially Claims That It Is Possible to Establish the Capital in Beiping, the Greater Beiping Plan Will Continue to be Completed

[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 21st] Beiping Mayor Xiong Bin stated unofficially to reporters that Beiping has a 70% chance of becoming China's future capital. According to the observation of the general public here, if the Northeast is successfully received and Rehe, Chahar, and Suiyuan are stabilized, then this matter may be realized sooner. It is reported that the United States is also very interested in China moving its political center to Beiping, because after the completion of the new port built by the Japanese in Tianjin, the situation in Beiping and Tianjin is very similar to that of Washington and New York. During his stay in Beiping, President Chiang attached great importance to Beiping's municipal administration. He once instructed Mayor Xiong to organize famous historical sites such as the Forbidden City and Jingshan Park. The Beiping Municipal Government has negotiated with the Xingying and appropriated 20% of the confiscated enemy and puppet property and materials as reorganization fees. The new Beijing, built by the enemy in the western suburbs of Beiping, is only one-fifth completed, and the authorities have decided to raise funds to continue construction in order to complete the Greater Beiping Plan. The iron pipes of the rainwater pool in the old days were dismantled by the Japanese, and now only more than 30 foreign wells supply water, so only 30% of the city uses tap water. The sewers are still old buildings built in the Ming Dynasty and have long been damaged. Mayor Xiong also stated that he is determined to repair them, and the rebirth of the ancient city may not be far away.

### Chairmen of Various Provinces in the Northeast are Ordered to Take Office Before New Year's Day Next Year, the Mayor of Changchun Has Formally Assumed Office

### Sino-Soviet Negotiations Show Slight Improvement, US Newspaper Claims That the Soviet Union Intends to Expand its Sphere of Influence

[United Press, Beiping, 22nd] Just as US Special Envoy Marshall arrived in Nanjing, the Sino-Soviet negotiations, which had been delayed for more than a month, have shown slight improvement, but have not yet been completed. According to the Beiping Office of the Northeast Security Command, Du Yuming's troops have set off from Jinzhou for Shenyang. However, it is still unknown whether we will enter Shenyang on Christmas or New Year's. Judging from the current situation, it seems more optimistic that the National Army will be transported by US ships to complete a large-scale landing. It is also reported that this move is the result of a meeting between General Marshall and the Chinese Supreme Command. In addition, it is also known that the South Manchurian Railway is more than 2,300 miles long, and disturbances occur from time to time along the line. The Japanese Showa Iron Works in Anshan and the surrounding areas, mines and factories have been closed. The two major chemical smelting furnaces in Shenyang, which were built in Germany, have been removed by the Soviet army, and the three major hydroelectric generators in Jilin have also been moved away. All these heavy industrial equipment are the subject of unresolved disputes between China and the Soviet Union as to which are "spoils of war" and which should be returned to China at the same time as the lost territories. [Reuters, London, 22nd] The Daily Telegraph reported from its Washington correspondent: American diplomats have realized that the Soviet Union intends to expand its sphere of influence to the nine eastern provinces of China, fearing that the Soviet Union will repeat its old tricks of creating autonomy in Azerbaijan in northern Iran and making territorial demands on Turkey in the nine provinces of northeastern China. It is expected that within a few weeks, an autonomous movement will appear in the Soviet-garrisoned areas of the Northeast. When President Truman spoke of the US Far East policy last Saturday, he strongly stated that the Soviet Union should return control of the Northeast to the Chinese Central Government. According to the Cairo Declaration of 1943 by the United Kingdom and the United States, the Potsdam Declaration of July this year by the Soviet Union, and the Sino-Soviet Treaty of August, the liberation of China, including the return of the Northeast, should be respected. Recent reports from China stated that the difficulty of the Sino-Soviet negotiations stems from the Soviet Union's request to jointly manage all the heavy industry in the Northeast with China. This request is not stipulated in the Sino-Soviet Treaty, which shows that the Soviet Union does have considerable ambitions for the nine eastern provinces of China.

### Minister Gu Attends the National Political Council, Reports on Social Administration Facilities, Li Zhongxiang and Others Request Relief for Private Shipping Industry

After the Secretary and Shao Lizi read the written report of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Minister of Social Affairs Gu Zhenggang reported on social administration facilities and the reception of recovered areas. The following resolutions were then passed: (1) A proposal by Councilors Li Zhongxiang, Chen Shaoxian, and Xi Yushu suggesting that the government provide relief to the private shipping industry to cultivate a foundation for shipping was resolved to be submitted to the government for prompt action. (2) A proposal by Councilors Chen Shaoxian, Li Zhongxiang, and He Baoren suggesting that the U.S. has agreed to continue freezing wartime deposits of Chinese citizens in the U.S., and requesting the government to negotiate extraction methods, and levy progressive heavy taxes, allocating all proceeds to improve people's livelihood, in order to crack down on wartime black money and balance social wealth, was resolved to be passed and submitted to the government for action. (3) Councilors Kong Geng, Yin Shuxian, and Wu Zhaoxu, based on a telegram from eight councilors in Peiping, including He Jihong, suggested the following points: A, The government should publicize the content of negotiations with the CCP at any time; B, Urge the government to convene the second plenary session of this council; C, All facilities in the Northeast should be no different from those in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Sichuan, and Guizhou provinces, and should not be treated as a special zone; D, Establish a list of traitors and arrest them promptly; E, Provide universal relief to North China. It was resolved that, except for the point regarding the convening of the second plenary session of the council, which has already been resolved, the other points should be submitted to the government for consideration.

### Three-Power Talks Frank and Friendly, Misunderstandings Not Entirely Eliminated, Generally Believed Some Agreements Will Be Reached, China and France to Be Notified of Matters Concerning Them

[United Press, Moscow, 22nd] According to well-informed sources close to the foreign ministers of the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union, the Moscow Three-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference has now reached the "stage of concretion." The three countries seem to be closer to agreement on important international issues than they were at the opening of the conference. Most of the previous suspicions have been dispelled. Although obstacles to understanding international issues have not been entirely eliminated, it is believed that some agreements will be reached.

[Reuters, Moscow, 22nd] The foreign ministers of Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union, along with their closest advisors and experts, held an informal meeting for four and a half hours yesterday. The meeting was extremely satisfactory, so it was decided to suspend formal meetings temporarily and continue informal meetings this afternoon. Authoritative sources say that these informal talks allow participants greater freedom of speech, thus enabling the scope of the talks to be broadened. All parties are still keeping silent about the content of the talks. It is also learned that U.S. Ambassador Harriman met with Chinese Ambassador to the Soviet Union Fu Bingchang yesterday, and it is said that both ambassadors were informed of all matters directly related to China and France.

Smooth Progress in Talks on Controlling Atomic Energy

According to well-informed sources in London: The three powers are making smooth progress in talks on atomic energy. The Soviet Union realizes that it may not be able to co-chair the United Nations Atomic Energy Commission with Britain and the United States at the UN General Assembly in January next year, based on the recommendations of the Washington atomic talks, but it is expected that the Soviet Union will not oppose this recommendation, and may still become a member of the commission. It is generally believed that if the Atomic Energy Commission proposed by Bevin and Byrnes to Molotov is established, it will be responsible to the Security Council composed of China, Britain, the United States, the Soviet Union, France, and six other countries on the control of the manufacture of atomic bombs and the scope of use of atomic bombs for the purpose of maintaining peace, and will be responsible to the UN General Assembly on the scope of developing atomic energy for industrial use. Judging from current trends, Bevin and Byrnes may spend Christmas in Moscow.

Soviet Press Launches Systematic Offensive Against Britain and the United States

[Reuters, London, 22nd] The Soviet press has launched a systematic offensive against the policies of Britain and the United States. The events being attacked are almost all within the agenda of the Three-Power Conference. "Pravda" led the attack on the presence of British troops in Greece, Egypt, Indonesia, and other foreign countries. This is a counterattack, because Iran has repeatedly requested the withdrawal of Soviet troops from Iran, so the Soviet Union rebuts why Britain and the United States still have troops stationed in friendly countries after the end of the war. The issue of troop withdrawal is a comprehensive issue and cannot be discussed solely on the basis of the withdrawal of troops from Iran. The British and American view is that the presence of Allied troops in Iran is based on the Anglo-Soviet-Iranian Treaty, so the issue of resolving the withdrawal of troops from Iran cannot be separated from that treaty. According to a telegram from the interior of Iran, the current crisis is expected to be resolved through direct negotiations between Tehran and Tabriz. Since the three powers have reached a stalemate due to the Iranian issue, the aforementioned method may also be considered. Another editorial in "Pravda" discussed the issue of the U.S. military's stay in China. Recent commentaries in other Soviet newspapers have also touched on the Japanese issue, so it is expected that the Soviet representative will firmly demand joint control of Japan and the withdrawal of U.S. troops from China when the Moscow conference discusses Far Eastern issues. There is no indication whether the Turkish issue will be raised in the Moscow conference. If the issue of the Dardanelles is discussed, the position of the British and American foreign ministers will definitely still be based on the notes that the two governments previously submitted to the Turkish government.

### Competition for Spheres of Influence by Great Powers Shifts from Eastern Europe to West Asia, British Empire's Lifeline Feels Threatened, Crisis of Future Just Beginning

[Reuters, London, 22nd] The New York Times correspondent reports that the competition for spheres of influence by great powers has shifted from Eastern Europe to West Asia. This phenomenon is not surprising, but it is difficult to absolve Britain and the United States of negligence for failing to take precautions. Since the Soviet Union formally requested the revision of the Montreux Convention in February, the crisis in the Middle East has taken a sharp turn for the worse, and the occurrence of the following three events coincides with the development of this crisis: (1) The holding of elections in the surrounding countries of Eastern Europe and the establishment of pro-Soviet regimes in countries such as South Bao have finally led to the establishment of the protection zone that the Soviet Union has dreamed of for a long time. (2) The withdrawal of foreign troops from Iran is approaching, and action should be taken as soon as possible if there is action. (3) The reopening of negotiations by the Allies has become increasingly urgent.

The Soviet Union deeply knows that it is easier to protect an accomplished fact than to demand the right to act in the future, so at the beginning of the Three-Power Conference in Moscow, the Soviet Union had already completed the deployment of an accomplished fact. Regarding the Iranian issue, two phenomena have emerged, one is the competition among the three powers, and the other is the competition between new and old social systems, and these two have a close relationship with each other. From the perspective of Britain and the United States, rather than protecting Iran's social and administrative system, it is better to directly attack Soviet interference, so that Britain and the United States themselves can also take decisive action. Although Iran urgently needs rural and social reforms, the influence of Britain and the United States in Tehran has not been able to make significant achievements in this regard, while the Soviet Union in northern Iran has been able to gain the support of the lower classes and ethnic minorities through its clever propaganda. What Britain and the United States do not understand is why the Soviet Union maintains a large number of troops in northern Iran, and has even increased its troops before the Azerbaijan incident occurred. The Soviet Union's ambitions in the Middle East can be said to be not small. In addition to hoping to obtain a base in the Dardanelles, Moscow also intends to obtain a part of Turkish Armenia in order to establish a more pro-Soviet government. In Iran, the Soviet Union hopes to obtain oil and other concessions, and intends to obtain routes to the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Aden to obtain warm-water ports in the Indian Ocean. The Soviet Union's development plan not only threatens the lifeline of the British Empire, but also hinders the oil rights of the United States in Saudi Arabia, so the Iranian issue has become the focus of the dispute among Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union. Britain has hastily signed the Levant Agreement with France to repair its rupture in Lebanon, but the Palestinian issue is still a thorny one, and the Soviet Union can also secretly instigate it. The solution to the Iranian issue seems to be inevitably beneficial to the Soviet Union, but Britain will inevitably suffer a blow as a result. If Azerbaijan and the Soviet Union become a de facto merger, Turkey will be surrounded and Iraq will be threatened. In short, the Soviet Union has gained the upper hand in the current development of the situation in the Middle East, but the crisis of the future is just beginning.

### Turkey Willing to Reconcile with the Soviet Union

[Reuters, Ankara, 22nd] Turkish Foreign Minister Saka declared in the National Assembly yesterday: Although the Soviet Union has not renewed the Treaty of Friendship and Non-Aggression with Turkey, it does not affect Turkey's desire to reconcile with the Soviet Union. Turkey's goal is to maintain peace internally and externally. We have continued and will continue to follow a consistent policy in the past and in the future, that is, we do not seek from others, nor do we give to others. We are still prepared to promote friendly relations with the Soviet Union. We will maintain this hope in order to achieve our goal. General Kara Beikir said that if the reports in the foreign press are true, then our northern neighbor seems to intend to make demands on me. The world should know that the straits are the throat of Turkey, and the Kars Plateau is the trunk of Turkey. I hope that this neighbor can maintain friendship with me, otherwise it will inevitably be detrimental to both parties. The province of Kars is located in eastern Turkey and was obtained from Russia after the last world war.

### British Concerns About East Indies Issue, Dutch Prime Minister to Visit Britain

[Reuters, London, 22nd] Sources predict that when Prime Minister Attlee meets with Dutch Prime Minister Schermerhorn and Dutch East Indies Deputy Governor-General Van Mook next week, he will tell them that Britain is deeply willing to order British troops to withdraw from Indonesia immediately after the safety of expatriates is guaranteed. Britain also hopes that Dutch leaders will contact Indonesian leaders to reach an agreement. The Dutch Prime Minister is expected to lead Van Mook and Colonial Minister Logemann to London on the 26th. Prime Minister Attlee is prepared to shorten the Christmas holiday and meet with them in advance. Britain's position is that British troops cannot remain in Indonesia for a long time. Although Britain has a responsibility to the Netherlands, it cannot use British troops as a tool to force Indonesians to accept Dutch will. The most important point is to maintain local order so that negotiations can proceed smoothly. London political figures deeply understand the background of the Indonesian issue, but at the same time believe that the widespread popular movement that has occurred in Indonesia cannot be ignored. Although Britain cannot determine the date of withdrawal, Britain should declare its intention to maintain order, conditional on the parties concerned promoting negotiations as soon as possible.

Dempsey Leaves Java, British Parachute Troops Sent Out

According to a telegram from Batavia, General Dempsey, Commander-in-Chief of the Allied Land Forces in Southeast Asia, and General Buck, Commander-in-Chief of the Air Force, arrived in Batavia yesterday and left again a few hours later. It is not known what mission they were on.

[TASS, London, 22nd] According to London Radio: The British 5th Parachute Brigade has been fully deployed in the Batavia area.

### Representatives of the Far Eastern Advisory Commission Scheduled to Depart for Japan

[Central News Agency, Washington, 21st, United Press] The Far Eastern Advisory Commission today listened to Pauley's report on the recent situation in Japan, and a summary of the report by Head of the Civil Affairs Department of the U.S. Army Department Hydringer to General MacArthur on educational and economic matters. A spokesman said that the issue of Soviet participation in the Far Eastern Advisory Commission was not mentioned today. The committee announced that MacArthur, Chairman of the Far Eastern Advisory Commission, will be the chairman of the delegation to Japan on December 26, and former Ambassador Johnson will be the Secretary-General. The main representatives are Chinese Lieutenant General Zhu Shimin, Philippine Interior Minister Confesor, Indian Saksena, and Sir Sansom, the United Nations representative of the UN Relief and Rehabilitation Administration Far East Committee.

### Foundation of New Japan Completed, Existing Feudal Institutions Almost Completely Eradicated, MacArthur Will No Longer Issue Important Directives

[United Press, Tokyo, 22nd] MacArthur's headquarters announced today that the foundational work for building a new Japan has been completed, and no further important directives will be issued. The creation of a "caring and harmonious country" will now depend entirely on the ability of the Japanese people to implement reforms based on the directives, and it is hoped that they will quickly complete them. Future directives will be limited to interpretation, so that the Japanese people can understand without confusion and fully comply. [United Press, New York, 21st] In just over a hundred days, MacArthur has eradicated Japan's old feudal institutions and rapidly laid the foundation for the establishment of a new democratic system in Japan. The Supreme Commander has issued a series of orders to achieve this goal, some of which have been so severe that even observers in Tokyo fear they will be openly resisted, but the Japanese people have adopted a completely obedient attitude to every order. With each directive that MacArthur issues, his prestige not only does not diminish, but also increases day by day.

### Two British Brigades to Participate in the Occupation of Japan Within a Month

[United Press, Hong Kong, 22nd] Admiral Fraser, Commander of the British Pacific Fleet, said that two British brigades are expected to land at the Wu naval port within a month to participate in the occupation of Japan. The operation of the Wu naval port will be the responsibility of the British Navy, and the land commander will be an Australian, commanding one brigade of Australian troops, one brigade of British Indian troops, and a New Zealand air force unit.

[Reuters, Hong Kong, 22nd] Admiral Fraser said that Hong Kong will re-establish its pre-war strength as a naval base and fleet forward command post.

### American Newspapers Oppose Soviet Expansion of Joint Control of Japan

[United Press, New York, 21st] The Howard newspapers wrote an editorial saying, "It is rumored that the Soviet Union is in the Moscow conference, fighting MacArthur for a large part of the authority to manage Japan." The editorial strongly opposed this point. The article said, "We do not believe that our government will agree to this. This approach will encourage the Japanese people to take advantage of their legacy, and will be similar to the chaos caused by the Soviet Union in occupied Germany. The division of power management system in Berlin is extremely unwise, and the result is only frustrating."

### Japanese Government Plans to Reorganize Administrative Structure

[United Press, Tokyo, 22nd] According to Kyodo News Agency: The Japanese government plans to reorganize the administrative structure, abolish the Ministry of Health and Welfare, add a Ministry of Public Works, disband the Information Bureau, and establish the Prime Minister's Office, with a Minister without Portfolio as the head of the office.

### American General Patton Dies Suddenly, U.S. Troops in German Occupation Zone Lower Flags in Mourning, Remains to Be Buried on European Battlefield

[This Newspaper, Tokyo, 22nd, Special Dispatch] Marshal MacArthur expressed infinite condolences for the sudden death of General Patton. It is said that General Patton was a brave and heroic soldier, and his great personality and unwavering determination will last forever. The American soldiers in the Pacific will surely mourn his sudden passing.

[United Press, Heidelberg, 21st] General Patton died peacefully in his sleep due to a blood clot in his lungs causing gangrene, leading to heart failure. According to a public statement issued by Major General Waylen, Chief of Staff of the U.S. Seventh Army, General Patton passed away peacefully at 17:50 on the 21st. Mrs. Patton flew to Heidelberg after her husband was injured in a car accident earlier this month. His wife was by his side when he died. It has been decided that the General's remains will be buried in a place on the route taken by the American troops when they drove into Germany, most likely within Luxembourg. General Patton died twelve days after he was injured in a car accident. The American occupation zone in Germany was ordered to fly flags at half-staff in mourning.

### On the Eve of the U.S.-Japan War, The Course of Peace Mediation, As Described in Konoe's Memoirs

[United Press, Tokyo, 22nd] According to Burton Crane, a correspondent for the New York Times: The Asahi Shimbun is publishing Konoe's memoirs in daily installments. One section states that in May 1941, the Japanese cabinet, with the consent of the army and navy, had agreed to accept the U.S. request to withdraw Japanese troops from China. It is claimed that one section of the memoirs that has already been published proves that the Japanese side understood that the adventure in China had completely failed and had greatly weakened Japan. When the Japanese cabinet accepted the U.S. proposal, both sides stipulated that the peace in all aspects of China should not be publicized, so as to avoid the Japanese side losing face excessively. The conditions agreed to by the Japanese side at that time included the following:

(1) Chinese independence;

(2) Withdrawal of Japanese troops from China;

(3) No annexation of Chinese territory;

(4) No compensation for losses;

(5) Restoration of the Open Door Policy;

(6) Merger of Chiang Kai-shek's government and Wang Jingwei's "government";

(7) Restriction of large-scale Japanese migration to China;

(8) Recognition of "Manchukuo." As for why this surprising Japanese liberal stance failed to result in an agreement, the details will be revealed when the Asahi Shimbun continues to publish its installments. According to Konoe's memoirs (which were written two weeks before Konoe committed suicide), the basis for the U.S.-Japan peace negotiations was laid down in December 1940. At that time, private American individuals, including Catholic Bishop Byrne, also participated. Progress was made, and the Japanese side submitted a preliminary plan to U.S. Secretary of State Hull on April 8, 1941. The U.S. side replied to the Japanese government on the 17th and 18th of the same month. At that time, the U.S. government requested an immediate meeting. Former Foreign Minister Matsuoka was suffering from a serious illness, but he still made major modifications to the U.S. proposal. The proposal was then submitted to a meeting held on May 3. At that time, except for Matsuoka, everyone advocated sending the modified plan to the U.S. side immediately, but Matsuoka insisted that Japan and the U.S. must first conclude a neutrality treaty, and advocated notifying Germany of the progress of this matter first. The cabinet opposed it, but Matsuoka ultimately prevailed. This matter was completely under his control. Matsuoka then sent two instructions to Japanese Ambassador Nomura. One of them was a letter to Hull, stating that Germany and Italy had absolute confidence in victory, and that U.S. participation would only prolong the war and destroy civilization. The letter also emphasized that the Japanese side could not take any action that would betray its allies. The other instruction instructed Nomura to declare that the neutrality treaty was the will of the Emperor.

On May 4, Matsuoka informed the Axis envoys stationed in Tokyo of what was happening in "absolute secrecy." As a result, Matsuoka's plan did not succeed, and the situation in the United States also changed due to the development of defense plans and the convoy incident.

### At the Request of the United States, Britain Makes Concessions to Siam, Withdrawing Some Harsh Demands

[United Press International, Washington, 21st] Reliable sources from Bangkok report today that, due to pressure from the United States, Britain has retracted many of its most stringent demands on Siam. Siamese Prime Minister Phra Phimonrat stated, "The Siamese people are particularly grateful to the United States, as that nation was willing to step forward to assist us in our time of difficulty." As news from Bangkok spread, rumors circulated in Washington, with some believing that the British government had abandoned most of its demands, with the exception of rice. Other well-informed sources stated that London was still demanding that Siam compensate for all damages caused to British property by Japanese and Allied air raids, and that in addition to rice compensation, Britain was also demanding that Siam bear the costs of Allied occupation forces. According to these sources, the Siamese government had offered either rice compensation or payment of air raid damages and occupation costs, but fulfilling both would bankrupt the country.

### Proposal within the US to Convert Hawaii into a State

[United Press International, Washington, 22nd] Secretary of the Interior Ickes today proposed to Congress that Hawaii be converted into a state of the United States.

### Prince Nashimoto and Several Others to be Released Soon

[United Press International, Tokyo, 22nd] According to responsible sources, Prince Nashimoto and several other war crimes suspects detained in Sugamo Prison will soon be released. According to US Chief Prosecutor Keenan, those war crimes suspects for whom there is insufficient evidence will naturally be released.

### Strengthen the United Nations Organization to Make it a World Government; Bevin Delivers Speech; Preparatory Committee's Work Concludes

[United Press International, London, 22nd] British Foreign Secretary Bevin last night addressed the leaders of the delegations to the Preparatory Committee, stating that the United Nations organization must become a world government, or it will be a mere formality. He also called for the immediate establishment of a strong regional United Nations organization in Europe. He stated, "At this time, we must aim high; a light approach is insufficient to solve major problems. I believe the United Nations organization must truly become a world government, and its new headquarters in the United States must become the political capital of the world." Bevin delivered this speech as the Preparatory Committee was drawing to a close and is expected to conclude by Sunday. The representatives of the fifty-one nations will reconvene at the first formal meeting of the United Nations General Assembly on January 10th next year.

Review of the Work of the Preparatory Committee

[Reuters, London, 22nd] The Preparatory Committee has effectively concluded its work. The work of the Administrative and Budgetary subcommittees will likely continue until the weekend, but other major issues have been resolved. Overall, the process has been satisfactory. The major issues discussed by the Preparatory Committee include:

(1) The location of the United Nations headquarters was decided to be in the United States. A subcommittee will select five cities from those competing in the United States, and the General Assembly will make the final decision. (2) It was decided not to establish a temporary trusteeship committee. Administering nations should be responsible for transitioning mandates to trusteeships. The drafted agreements should be submitted to the initial meeting of the United Nations General Assembly, and the trusteeship agreements should be reviewed by the General Assembly's Trusteeship Committee. (3) The General Assembly should establish a General Committee to carry out guiding tasks. Its organization and powers have been agreed upon. (4) The relationship with various specialized agencies, such as the International Labour Organization, will be discussed by the General Assembly. From this perspective, the Preparatory Committee has resolved three of the four major issues left over by the Executive Committee. Only the issue of specialized agencies could not be resolved by the Preparatory Committee. Judging from the situation at this meeting of the Preparatory Committee, all representatives are willing to accept the opinion of the majority, which is a good sign for the future of the United Nations organization.

Nations Form Regional Groups

However, during the voting process, representatives of various countries seem to have a tendency to form regional groups. The group formed by the representatives of the Soviet Union, Ukraine, Belarus, Poland, Yugoslavia, and Czechoslovakia is the most closely knit. The group led by the United States, consisting of representatives from various South American countries, is more loosely organized. Britain, along with its Dominions and Western European countries, has also formed a group. As for the Chinese representatives, they often like to propose compromise solutions when conflicting opinions arise. In conclusion, the results of the work of the United Nations Preparatory Committee are quite encouraging. However, the phenomenon of representatives of various countries forming groups seems somewhat inappropriate. Furthermore, the holding of the Moscow Conference effectively determines the tasks of the United Nations organization through the relations of powerful nations outside the United Nations organization, which is nothing less than a re-enactment of power politics, which is truly not suitable for the post-war world.

Residents of Trust Territories Allowed to Speak

[Central News Agency, London, 21st] After a three-session debate, the Technical Subcommittee of the United Nations Preparatory Committee has passed the Ukrainian representative's proposal to amend a procedural rule of the Trusteeship Council, granting the Trusteeship Council the power to use various different methods to ensure that the people of the trust territories have the opportunity to fully express their opinions. For example, if a representative body exists, it should be allowed to express its views, hold open elections of spokespersons, consult with local national organizations, hold general elections, and the Trusteeship Council should send special representatives to directly contact the people of the trust territories, etc.

### United Nations Headquarters Decided to be in the Eastern United States

[United Press International, London, 22nd] The United Nations Preparatory Committee voted today to establish the permanent headquarters of the United Nations organization in the eastern United States, excluding San Francisco.

### Agreement Reached Between Britain and France on the Withdrawal of Troops from Lebanon and Syria

[Reuters, London, 22nd] The agreement between Britain and France regarding the withdrawal of British and French troops from the territory of Livent (i.e., Syria and Lebanon), published yesterday, stipulates that the United Nations organization will make the final decision on the security of the Livent region. Before the United Nations organization takes over, Britain and France will retain an appropriate number of troops in the area to ensure its security. The withdrawal of British and French troops will be completed simultaneously. The British and French governments further guarantee that they will not engage in any actions in the Middle East region that would harm the interests or responsibilities of the other party. According to this agency's diplomatic correspondent, it is not possible to discern from this agreement when the United Nations organization will be able to decide on the security guarantee arrangements for the Livent region, or what form these arrangements will take.

### The Emperor and Imperial Family Will Also Be Required to Pay Taxes Hereafter

[United Press International, Tokyo, 22nd] Emperor Hirohito and all members of the Imperial Family will henceforth be subject to tax obligations. The first type is the war profits tax. This matter was decided yesterday by the Imperial Household Ministry and the Ministry of Finance. Imperial property, which has not been taxed in the past, will also be examined hereafter so that taxes will be paid in the same way as ordinary people.

### Philippine Bar Association to Try Hirohito

[United Press International, Washington, 21st] The American Bar Association today published a letter from the Philippine Bar Association to President Truman, requesting that Emperor Hirohito be tried for war crimes.

### Over 80,000 Japanese Plead for Yamashita's Clemency; He Requests Seppuku

[Special Dispatch from This Newspaper, Tokyo, 22nd] A spokesperson for General MacArthur stated that US Secretary of the Army Patterson, in accordance with the will of the Supreme Court, has ordered Yamashita Tomoyuki's lawyers to fly to Washington, but the number of lawyers is limited to three, and the time is to be determined by them. They can request the court to issue a writ of habeas corpus and a stay of execution pending appeal, either in simple written form or orally. Today, 86,000 Japanese people petitioned MacArthur to reduce Yamashita's sentence to life imprisonment or allow him to commit seppuku.

### Mourning General "Blood and Guts": Patton's Heroic Spirit Lives On! - This Newspaper Archives

General Patton, the commander of the Third Army who was the first American to enter German territory, has finally died in Heidelberg from lung injuries sustained in a car accident! This is a great loss.

MacArthur said sorrowfully in his telegram of condolence: "General Patton died in a state of great beauty, giving me the deepest sorrow. He was a brave and dashing military strategist. The entire Pacific force must mourn him." I now translate the simple and powerful eulogy above from the telegram sent from MacArthur's headquarters in Tokyo. I imagine that our entire army and people who once fought alongside General Patton will feel deep sorrow and even lower our heads to mourn him and shed tears for him when we hear this tragic news!

Patton's Background

General Patton was from California, USA, and would have been 60 years old this year. In his youth, he excelled in marksmanship and was also a track and field athlete. He attended the World Games held in Stockholm, Sweden, and showed his talent and great skill.

He was admired for his heroic appearance as a tank warfare expert. He founded the first tank school. He led a tank brigade to attack the German army and established great military exploits.

Well said, MacArthur! When we mourn General Patton, the first thing we must commemorate is his bravery. In winter, he liked to wear a brown leather coat and sit in a tank to lead his troops and command the battle. He most admired the spirit of "leading by example" and "supervising the battle in person." His motto was what he often said to his subordinates, and it was not just talk, but he practiced it himself. Listen to what he said:

"Advance, keep advancing! Even when the last bullet and the last drop of gasoline are used up, you must still run forward!"

Brief History of the Expedition

In the First European War, General Patton was promoted from the rank of captain to colonel due to his outstanding military achievements. He received many medals and served as a staff officer to General Pershing. After the war, he served as a cavalry training officer and regimental commander. When the Second European War broke out, the brave and skilled General Patton was ordered to lead his troops on an expedition. He personally commanded the battles in the theaters of Italy, France, Belgium, Germany, Austria, and Czechoslovakia, creating many brilliant achievements. In the Sicilian campaign, we will not forget General Patton's bravery. He jumped into the sea from a boat, led his army to land on the other shore, and completed his planned strategy.

A Dashing Soldier

General MacArthur praised General Patton's bravery and skill in battle, which can be clearly demonstrated by this example. As for why we should praise his dashing and romantic nature? Well, there are also examples to cite. General Patton was by no means a simple-minded military man. On the contrary, he was a man of both literary and military talents, or perhaps it would be more appropriate to call him a poet-like military man. In the midst of war, he did not forget to compose poetry, which was one of his special hobbies. He wrote two volumes of poetry, which were known to all walks of life in the United States. Now, has he passed away before seeing its publication? This is regrettable. In addition, his legacy of tank warfare theory is worth introducing.

Direct Assault on German Territory

Last year, when the United States was still at war with Germany, he appeared on the battlefield as the commander of the Third Army. He launched a surprise attack from Normandy, leading his armored units to penetrate France and directly attack the Ardennes region. In other words, he had already broken into the Nazi German positions. This massive offensive dealt a fatal blow to the German army, breaking the enemy general Lundstedt's final counter-offensive plan. At the same time, his Fourth Armored Division took this opportunity to charge into southern Germany from Lunner, penetrating deep into the enemy's territory at a top speed of 80 miles per day. Later, in forty-two days, the pace of the advance became even fiercer, creating a new record of an average of 100 miles per day.

After the defeat of Germany, General Patton served as the commander of the eastern sector of the American occupation zone in Germany, and was later transferred to the commander of the Fifteenth Army, with continued distinction. Now, he is dead. It is said that he will soon be buried in a European cemetery. No, no, he will live in the hearts of all the military and civilians of the United Nations and in our memories.

### London in Mid-Month: A Panoramic View of a New Atmosphere

— Special Correspondent for This Newspaper: Zhu Jiarang

It's just an hour's flight from Paris to London. If you take the train, you have to cross the English Channel, which takes about sixteen hours from start to finish, with half of that time spent on passport checks and other procedures at the Franco-British border. It was my first time taking a train between England and France, and to my surprise, it wasn't much different from those in China. Although I traveled in a first-class overnight train, there were no sleeping berths, so we all just sat through the night, wide awake. We boarded the ship at dawn, seeing white waves rolling endlessly, the sea and sky meeting at the horizon. The turbulent storms of 1940-41 had passed, and it should be a season of gentle breezes and warm sunshine from now on.

Getting off the train at Victoria Station, the famous "Foggy City" was entirely shrouded in a hazy mist. The large and dense buildings were indistinguishable in the dim yellow light. However, the double-decker yellow buses running continuously on the roads, the storefronts, and the traffic lights didn't seem any different to someone used to Shanghai and Hong Kong, because they were all of the same type. The porters and all the public transport workers at London's stations, like in France, were mostly women, but they were sturdier and more powerful than the French ones. I remember getting off the train that day and having to run to keep up with the woman who was carrying our luggage and pushing the cart.

The general "old grandeur" of London is displayed quite fully and universally. The signs of ordinary shops and companies often have "1881" or "1901" written on them, to show their age. The architecture doesn't have the heavily made-up and delicately carved style of Paris, but it is tall and imposing, not inferior in any way. In particular, the exterior is covered in soot and not often cleaned, because that's the record of history. The entire city is vast, and the underground trains reach everywhere, seeming cleaner and more comfortable than in Paris. Just like in Shanghai, there are over a hundred double-decker yellow bus routes running all day long. A female ticket seller jumps up and down the stairs tirelessly, and it would be hard for someone with a weaker constitution to manage. Another symbol of London's "old grandeur" is the style of its taxis, which resemble medieval carriages, and are driven by old men. However, it is quite comfortable to sit inside.

Commemorative Buildings Located in Lively Central Areas

I have been studying London's history for a long time. It really began with the stretch along the Thames River, so that area looks particularly old. The roads are as narrow as Shanghai's Fourth Avenue or Huajinli, and many only allow one-way traffic. Although the buildings are solid, they are not modern at all. The Tower Bridge, which crosses the river, resembles two fortresses. The middle section can be raised and lowered, and it's one of the oldest representatives. Further down the Thames, past the two new Waterloo bridges in London, is the famous Westminster Abbey, a great structure from the eleventh century. A massive rectangular building by the river is the Parliament of the United Kingdom, the mother of world constitutionalism.

Westminster Abbey is as grand as St. Peter's Basilica in Rome, but their moods are different. The former is full of antiquity, while the latter excels in exquisite religious art. Westminster was built in 1050 and used to be where kings were crowned and where sacred ceremonies were held. The architecture has a solemn feel, with its altar, choir, and pipe organ. Although there are many people attending services on Sundays, they only occupy a corner of the huge cathedral. Westerners regard the church as a place for personal cultivation and religious education. Before scientific answers to questions of life and death are confirmed, religion still holds an unshakable force. Westminster is also the final resting place for the greatest figures of all ages. There are marble coffins all around, accompanied by countless statues and inscriptions. This makes it easier for future generations to remember them than burying them in remote mountains and fields, and the method seems worthwhile. In the future, when we in China build tombs for nameless heroes, or any commemorative buildings for famous people, I think we should also move them to lively downtown areas, as that is the only way they will have meaning.

The Great Bastion of British Constitutionalism: Inside the Parliament

The British Parliament is bustling with activity year-round. Since Churchill stepped down and the Labour Party came to power, differences in ideology have led to amendments to legislation, and the atmosphere in the House of Commons feels tense every day, with constant verbal battles. I had the chance to visit once. Inside this bastion of British constitutionalism, there are two parts: the House of Lords and the House of Commons, each with its own meeting hall, library, committee room, offices, as well as restaurants and tea rooms. The tall, massive clock tower strikes clear and skilled symphonic notes, reporting Greenwich Mean Time, which is broadcast worldwide every day. The wide waters of the Thames River flow silently beneath it, like a running ledger quietly recording the honors and riches of the British Empire, as well as its hardships and subsequent recovery. The great power of the Parliament now resides in the House of Commons. All the government's measures must be subject to the review and questioning of the people's representatives. Britain values freedom, and even any Tom, Dick, or Harry can express themselves freely in Hyde Park, so it is naturally even more the responsibility of parliamentarians to speak their minds freely in Parliament. Therefore, there are many questions every day. Meetings are held every week from Monday to Friday, starting at 2 PM and lasting until 9 or 10 PM. Members of Parliament eat and drink inside. Last week, some people even missed their train because it was so late, so they slept in Parliament. On average, they spend seven or eight hours a day in meetings, and the British are indeed quite capable of holding meetings. But what does their meeting place look like? Is it grand? If you have high hopes, you will be greatly disappointed. This place where important policies are discussed and the struggles of head figures occur, is about the size of the auditorium of the Central Party Headquarters in Chongqing, except for small balconies around it for journalists and observers. The facilities in the meeting hall are not very elaborate. Members of Parliament sit facing each other, with the government party on the right and the opposition party on the left, in rows of long leather-cushioned chairs. Everyone sits casually, and there are no tables for reading or writing in front of them, which must be said to be simple. However, it is said that it has been passed down from ancient times, and so they have simply "conserved" it. During the meeting time, except for reports from the Prime Minister or cabinet members, all the time is spent on questioning, debating, and passing bills. There are as many questions as hairs on an ox, and any kind of question can be raised. I remember that when I visited the other day, one of the more than two hundred questions asked whether the government's stationery used in a certain period compared with that taken from the government stationery supply department. From this, it can be seen that it is not easy to be a cabinet minister in Britain. First, you have to be a thorough expert who can always cite figures. Second, you have to have a special level of cultivation, otherwise you cannot afford to lose your temper. The demeanor of the parliamentarians in the hall seems more lively than in our parliament. When I walked in that day, I heard laughter naturally, it was not "solemn." To second what someone else said, you don't even need to raise your hand, you can just say "Yes" repeatedly. Some people even put their feet on the chairs, but every time they enter or leave, they bow to the chairman's seat on the spot, showing politeness.

A 180-Degree Turn: The Tumultuous Political Situation of the British Government

Today's political situation in Britain has been reported by the Central News Agency, so there is no need for me to dwell on it. But in describing the British Parliament, it is impossible not to mention that after the war, this country's major policies have been moving in the direction of socialism. However, due to the current economic difficulties and scarcity of resources, coupled with the fact that free capitalism has been around for hundreds of years, and everything has always been privately run, it is naturally difficult to get used to such a 180-degree turn psychologically. Moreover, since the Labour Party came to power, they have been vigorously pursuing planned economics and nationalization, but distant water cannot quench immediate thirst. The people are eager for governance and hope for an improvement in their lives and the lifting of controls. However, in the current situation, the Labour government has stated that the existing rationing system will continue for five more years, and the nationalization plan will be extended indefinitely. In the past, Britain's railways, postal services, and even the Bank of England were privately run, but they are now being gradually nationalized. Foreign trade and financial controls are tight, and the government is asking people to fill out more and more forms every day, so the atmosphere of criticism is becoming more and more serious. Former Conservative Prime Minister Churchill fiercely criticized the Labour Party at the party's congress last week, saying that they had misplaced the priorities in their administration, and were just drawing up forms every day for people to fill out, and it looked like the "tearful farewell" that is popular in our country. Old Churchill celebrated his seventy-first birthday the day before yesterday and is preparing to have a major debate with Attlee in Parliament this week.

Generally speaking, Britain has been deeply affected by the war, and the lives of the people are still struggling and suffering on the edge. Fortunately, the government is clean and efficient, so many necessary supplies are still available, but controls are tight, so unnecessary or unauthorized supplies are truly impossible to obtain. This is a unique political talent of the British, which others cannot match, and it is feared that Britain's survival today depends on this lifeline. Currently, there is no talk of enjoyment for the British people. From the perspective of someone who has arrived in England from Chongqing, their clothing, housing, and transportation are indeed better than those in China, but the food is too poor, lacking oil and fat, and there is fear of malnutrition. Eating in restaurants is limited by price controls, unless you stuff yourself with bread. Perhaps the authorities are particularly polite to Chinese restaurants, and you can get special food, but it costs ten shillings, which is more than double. Britain is currently experiencing a labor shortage, and women are all out working, but when you ask about their wages, they are very low. It is said that the average weekly salary for the middle and lower working class is only four or five pounds. With this meager amount, after paying rent, there is not enough left to do anything other than eat at self-service cafeterias (which are popular in England and America, where everything is self-service to save on tea service) and barely get by, and there is no room for social interaction. However, this situation still cannot be compared with our country, because prices are not rising much in the first place. Women can still put on makeup and dress up, and movie theaters are still mostly filled with working men and women. Furthermore, it is already difficult for the working class in Chongqing to afford to buy newspapers, but it is not a big deal here, and that is another example.

Democratic Politics on Track, Life Becoming Tense

Looking at Britain's political economy and social measures, if we set aside the rights and wrongs, gains and losses, successes and failures, and look at the spirit of it, there is something admirable. British politics, with its long-standing democratic foundations, can truly be said to be on track. Although there are too many departments in the British cabinet, and their positions are uneven and their names are mixed, the official discipline and administrative efficiency are quite good. The salaries of the British Prime Minister and cabinet members vary greatly. The Prime Minister's annual salary is 10,000 pounds, the major ministers (such as foreign affairs, finance, and military affairs) get 6,000 pounds, and the minor ministers are said to get only 1,000 pounds. After deducting a heavy income tax, even the minor ministers find it difficult to make ends meet and have requested a raise. But it is also enough to show that they probably really live on their salaries. The British have their own unique political skills and seem to have profound plans for economic and social policies. Beveridge's social security plan, which provides full insurance for every person from birth to death, will be implemented by the Labour government, but there has already been a good security system in the past. This can be seen from the fact that every British person, regardless of their status, always has two registration cards: a health card and an employment card. They and their employers pay a small fee to the nearest government authority every month. When they get sick, they can use the card to see a doctor and get medicine without paying a penny. If they become unemployed, they can also use the employment card to receive the prescribed relief from the government. This is certainly a product of the capitalist era, but the scale of social security is roughly in place. However, there are also people who oppose this policy, believing that from now on everyone will not have to work too hard, since the government will always provide food. We work too hard, and we only support those who do not work hard, so why should we work so hard to be model citizens? In reality, everything in the world has a positive and a negative side, and the government can only strive for more strictness, fairness, and reasonableness in its methods.

The situation in London seems much more tense than in Paris. The streets are so crowded with people, all of whom seem to have official business and are walking quickly, not taking leisurely steps. The buildings crowd the streets tightly, and in the middle there is a constant stream of traffic, which reflects in a particularly busy and hurried mood. Furthermore, as the hub of international politics and economics, many important figures come and go here. The preparatory meeting of the United Nations Organization is not over until mid-month, and there are more programs coming one after another. The atomic bomb problem, the Nuremberg trials, the Washington loan negotiations, the dispute over price competition for American airplanes, as well as the Labour government's repeated nationalization plans and the wave of factory strikes fill the various newspapers every day. Fleet Street puts out no less than ten million copies of newspapers a day. The Times has to print seven editions a day, and you can't order it, it's sold out early in the morning. The Standard Evening News starts in the morning. Londoners are constantly concerned about their own livelihood issues, and they are aware of the development of the world. Therefore, except for Buckingham Palace, which is still quiet, the city seems tense and busy everywhere. (34, 12, 5, sent from London)

### Examining the Similarities and Differences Between the U.S. and the Soviet Union from the Perspective of International Friendship — Translated by This Newspaper's Translation Department from the December 18th Continental Daily

The United States and the Soviet Union, these two continental powers, bear a heavier responsibility for the newly gained world peace than any other country. The combined strength of these two countries can maintain world order. They can balance international power, adjust humanity's uncertain predicaments, and at the same time unite other countries, large and small, to ensure a world security organization. Conversely, if these two great forces diverge, any international combination will be hindered.

If the great power nurtured by the United States and the Soviet Union is not directed towards construction, those scientists who study atomic energy might as well immediately take a flying arrow and escape to Venus, so as not to be destroyed along with the Earth. Today, humanity's attainment in physics has reached its peak, and you cannot help but coordinate politics with this invention.

Two Major Axes: Washington and Moscow

There are two fundamentally conflicting political systems in the world, with their axes in Washington and Moscow. If a satisfactory dividing line can be drawn between these two countries, atomic experts can use atomic energy to clear the wastelands of the Sahara and the Arctic, which would be more meaningful.

These two countries have much in common: they both established their countries through revolutionary bloodshed, and they both have large numbers of colonial territories. American pioneers migrated westward towards the ocean, while Soviet pioneers migrated eastward towards the ocean. They both have one ocean—the Pacific Ocean—as their goal. In terms of territorial expansion, the United States and the Soviet Union are very similar. The Mexican-American War and the purchase of the Gadsden Purchase are similar to the Soviet Union's entry into the Caucasus and Turkestan, and its penetration into Mongolia and Manchuria.

Both the United States and the Soviet Union have their own unique industrial revolutions, which have brought about great changes in national wealth and national power. The United States completed its inland river transportation routes due to the oil refining industry and the westward movement of industries, while the Soviet Union developed its raw materials and also moved its industries eastward across the Ural Mountains.

In addition, there is the similarity of the mature national forms of the United States and the Soviet Union. Both have plunged into the whirlpool of international events and no longer adopt traditional isolationism. The Soviet Union controls most of the land and political power in Europe and Asia, and will never shrink into an isolated corner again. The United States dominates North and South America and the seven seas, and will never return to the era of President Jefferson in 1812.

Abandoning Isolation and Plunging into the International Whirlpool

Tradition is difficult to forget, whether in a country or in an individual. Due to previous lessons, Americans generally still believe that Britain is cunning and often takes advantage of them. Therefore, the American people actually distrust their overseas diplomatic representatives, believing that they will inevitably be deceived when dealing with sophisticated foreigners. The Soviet Union also has this instinctive feeling. It has always distrusted any foreign country. It has turned over history and knows that it has been defeated by the Mongols, Turks, Swedes, Poles, and Japanese, and has also been attacked by Napoleon, Kaiser Wilhelm, and the Allied Powers of the Three Kingdoms. Therefore, it has a historic distrust of these neighboring countries and all threatening forces. The Soviet Union only has one border, and it has never suffered any losses from it, and that is the United States.

Continental Countries: Mental and Psychological Connection

In general, Americans and Soviets have many psychological similarities. Perhaps it is the common nature of mankind. They are both generous, frank, and tend to extremes—extreme exaggeration, humor, and heavy drinking. They are also very fascinated by volume, either building the tallest building in the world or building the largest dam in the world. Both take a biased path, combining the superior and the inferior, resulting in two different tendencies: one is superior self-confidence, and the other is fear of backwardness.

The spiritual similarities and differences between the United States and the Soviet Union arouse great interest in the world. Freedom is the foundation of American ideals, while social security is the cornerstone of the Soviet Union. Of course, a compromise is possible between these two extremes, because what America calls freedom is useless to someone who is starving to death, and what the Soviet Union calls social security is meaningless to pioneers.

Now let's talk further about the degree of mutual understanding between the United States and the Soviet Union.

"In the Soviet Union, although there are still laziness, factional politics, wasting time, restrictions, autocracy, and the police system, if Americans therefore dismiss this great experimental system in this century, thinking that it only represents atheism, the police system, and queuing up for bread, then that is as unreasonable as saying that the United States only represents strikes, lynchings, and racial discrimination.

As the relationship between the United States and the Soviet Union is developing, these erroneous views must be corrected through the exchange of ideas and education between each other.

Mutual Exploration as a Reference for National Relations

In communist Soviet Union, their intellectuals will tell you: "There is no communism here yet, we are working towards this goal. All we have now is national socialism." There are still millionaires—mostly made in the black market—collective farmers, and beggars. Under Stalinism, the "aristocracy of ability" created by Peter the Great, such as artists, engineers, and generals, still exists. The only difference is that they have no official titles, and their privileges cannot be inherited by their children.

If it is said that the Soviet Union is a mystery that cannot be understood by the outside world, then this statement is obviously outdated. The United States and the Soviet Union have not yet understood each other, and they should explore each other's advantages and disadvantages in the future, as a reference for national relations.

In terms of normal international relations, there is no major reason for competition between the United States and the Soviet Union. Because both have raw materials, industry, manpower, and domestic markets. Both can take care of themselves in wartime or peacetime, and the United States and the Soviet Union can take this opportunity to trade with each other, for example, exchanging timber, gasoline, minerals, and furs for instruments, machine products, and industrial inventions.

Atomic Bomb Promotes the Speed of Reconstruction

But the reasons for friction between the two are as follows: (1) mutual distrust, (2) differences in economic thought, and (3) different views on freedom and security.

Strangely, since the invention of the atomic bomb, these two major countries have instead coordinated, and not out of fear or jealousy. The Soviet Union often felt that the standing army trained for national defense cost the treasury a great deal. Now that new weapons have been invented, they can take this opportunity to free up a large amount of manpower for factories, mining, and agriculture, so that the speed of post-war reconstruction can be increased.

Currently, the United States is the largest right-wing country, and the Soviet Union is the largest left-wing country. Both are very careful about protecting their own way of life and rule. If they can mutually guarantee by action that they have no private intentions to clash with each other or to force each other to make social reforms, without the foreign armed intervention of the First World War era, or the Third International that existed in the past, then the friendship between the two countries can be increased. If this hope is realized, the Soviet Union's doors will be wide open, giving foreigners the opportunity to inspect and study. At that time, the United States will begin to understand that what is red is not necessarily hostile. (Written by Sulzberger)

Weekly Forum

### Public Doctor System

— Yu Songyun

What is Called the "Public Doctor System"?

Before explaining what the "Public Doctor System" is, I would like to draw everyone's attention to the following: Currently, if we get sick and need to see a doctor and buy medicine, these two medical matters often cost a lot of money. What is the result? Naturally, the rich have the means to get cured, while the poor can only suffer from their illnesses. Moreover, "poverty" and "illness" often become causes and effects of each other, cyclically reinforcing each other. The poorer one is, the more illnesses one gets; the more illnesses one gets, the poorer one becomes. Getting sick is already a painful matter, but not being able to get medicine when one is sick is perhaps the most pitiful thing of all.

Furthermore, from the perspective of medicine itself, medical skills and drugs are originally meant to help the world and save lives, but now they have all become commodities. Some doctors, when treating patients, demand more money the more severe the illness becomes, thus turning their medical practice into a tool for extortion. Some medicines are very effective, but they are very expensive. For example, a new medicine invented in America, when brought to China, is not easy to buy on the market. As a result, one bottle of medicine can cost as much as one hundred and twenty thousand. Medicine becoming a commodity also devalues the inherent worth of medicine itself. This is also an unreasonable phenomenon!

In the past, wealthy people, seeing the poor suffering from illness, often engaged in charitable acts of providing medical care and medicine. This was a charitable and philanthropic undertaking of a relief nature. Now, due to the surge of democratic trends, many people believe that the government should bear the responsibility for medical care and medicine for the people when they fall ill. Sun Yat-sen, the Father of the Nation, advocated the Three Principles of the People. In terms of the Principle of People's Livelihood, he also strongly advocated that we should use the power of the state to ensure that every individual can live a comfortable life. Therefore, in another speech, he advocated that the government should solve the medical problems for the people, so that the poor, when they fall ill, have no other recourse but to resign themselves to fate. Untreated illness and weakness is a blow to the individual, and also a loss to the nation. Now, if the state takes on the responsibility for medical care for the people, so that whether rich or poor, they can receive appropriate treatment when they fall ill, this system is called the "Public Doctor System."

Under the public doctor system, medical care and medicine will no longer be exclusive to the wealthy, nor will they be commodities. The use of medicine will thus advance to a new era.

The countries in the world that have implemented the public doctor system most effectively are the Soviet Union and New Zealand. New Zealand's method is as follows: the country is divided into forty-two regions, and various medical institutions, such as hospitals, maternity hospitals, dental clinics, etc., are evenly distributed according to the size of the population and the area. Half of the funding for these medical institutions is allocated from local tax revenue, and the other half is subsidized by the central government. The management of funds is the responsibility of a board of directors elected by the local people. In New Zealand, 90% of all hospitals and clinics are established by the government, and the remaining 10% of hospitals and clinics, although privately owned, also receive a portion of their funding from the government. Since 1940, the New Zealand government has stipulated that all hospitals and clinics nationwide provide free treatment. This is also the case for private hospitals and clinics. However, for each patient treated by a private hospital or clinic, the government provides a subsidy of two pounds per week. The government also provides another type of subsidy to sick families. Families with a weekly income of less than five pounds receive a subsidy of four shillings per week when a child under the age of sixteen becomes ill. People over the age of sixteen who are unable to work due to illness receive a sickness allowance of about seven shillings per week.

The Soviet Union's public doctor system is implemented even more thoroughly. Its methods can be summarized in several points:

(1) All medical personnel, including doctors, pharmacists, nurses, midwives, etc., are civil servants of the state. The majority of them are paid by the government and are subject to government dispatch.

(2) All medical institutions are established by the government, or by the government mobilizing social forces and establishing them under the strict supervision of the government.

(3) The medical expenses of the people are borne by the government. In other words, all medical and drug expenses are paid by the government from tax revenue.

(4) In terms of medical and health technology, the boundary between "prevention" and "treatment" is broken, and "prevention" and "treatment" are regarded as one and the same thing. Now we can understand the meaning of the "Public Doctor System." In summary, the so-called "Public Doctor System" has the following characteristics:

(A) From a political point of view, it is a system in which the government assumes full responsibility for the medical needs of the people:

(B) From an economic point of view, it breaks the restrictions imposed by the private property system on the medical needs of the people.

(C) From a social point of view, it prevents "medicine" and "drugs," which save lives and help the world, from becoming commodities in the marketplace.

(D) From a technical point of view, it breaks the defect in medicine of separating "prevention" and "treatment" into two separate things.

Our China, in order to realize the Three Principles of the People of the Father of the Nation, must also adopt such a system in terms of medical care and hygiene. Therefore, at the Fifth Session of the Eighth Plenary of the Kuomintang, a motion was passed to "implement a public doctor system to ensure the health of all people," and the government then actively planned to implement it based on this motion. In May of the twenty-ninth year [1940], the Executive Yuan announced an "Outline of Hygiene Organizations at All Levels in the County," in conjunction with the "New County System," stipulating that each county should establish a health institute, each district below the county should establish a health branch, each township should establish a health center, and each bao [neighborhood unit] should set up a health worker. According to statistics, by July of the thirty-third year [1944], among the one thousand three hundred and sixty-one counties in the twenty provinces in the rear, nine hundred and thirty-eight counties had established health institutes, one hundred and ninety-six health branches, one thousand five hundred and sixty-one township health centers, and one thousand five hundred and seventy-seven bao health workers. This is the initial step in implementing the "Public Doctor System," which is to make medical institutions widespread throughout the country and deeply rooted among the people in terms of organization. However, implementing such a system is extremely difficult. The most important thing is that the promotion of the "Public Doctor System" requires a large number of talents and funds, and we currently do not have appropriate solutions for these two items. However, the Father of the Nation tells us: "It is difficult to know, but not difficult to do." As long as we believe in this system and believe that this system must be implemented, and use the strength of our entire country to support it and promote it, I believe that even if there are greater difficulties, we can certainly solve them satisfactorily. By "the strength of the entire country," I mean that this matter requires not only the government's efforts, but also the cooperation of all the people of the country. Only in this way can this system be realized as soon as possible. I am raising this topic today, on the one hand, to hope that everyone understands this system, and at the same time, I hope that everyone supports this system and promotes this system.

Commercial News

### Divergent Opinions on New Exchange Rate; Gold Market Strengthens Again; US Dollars and Hong Kong Notes Both Rise

Yesterday, it was reported that the opinions of the local industrial, commercial, and financial sectors on the new exchange rate strongly advocated for a rate of 1,600 to 1, as suggested to Mr. Bei Songsun of the Central Bank of China. This news made people feel bullish, and buying interest was revived. Although the market opened flat, due to buyers scrambling to purchase, prices rose to 762,000. Many parties sold at high prices, slightly suppressing the market, but strong players continued to absorb. Thereafter, the market mostly fluctuated, with minimal ups and downs. In the afternoon, it also struggled around 755,000. As a result, the market closed up 24,000 compared to the previous day. General sentiment gradually ceased to expect an overly low new exchange rate, and the market showed signs of recovery. Gold jewelry was listed at 81,000, silver at 600 yuan, and silver dollars showed little progress, fluctuating between 440 and 445. Although the North China Daily News carried a report that a US senator proposed that the government should sell silver at the official price of 71 cents, otherwise the black market would rise to $1.29 and be unstoppable, this news did not attract attention. Private lending, boosted by securities to lift the stock market, saw gradually increasing demand, slightly tightening. Private lending stabilized at around 10%.

US dollars, due to slightly positive news, boosted sentiment. After opening, the price rose from 1,230 yuan to 1,265 yuan. Thereafter, some parties sold to profit, and the supply was slightly abundant, so the market fluctuated slightly with the gold market. Finally, the price hovered around 1,255 yuan, resulting in a rise of 43 yuan compared to the previous close. Hong Kong notes continued to rise steadily. It was heard that the local market price still equated to 80 yuan in the Shanghai market. If calculated with exchange rates, it was still deemed profitable. People in the shipping industry had some demand, resulting in old notes rising slightly by 5 yuan and new notes rising by 6 yuan. However, supply and demand gradually balanced at high prices, and market prices also varied.

### Major Players Exert Effort to Boost Market; Chinese Stocks Advance Vigorously; Government Bonds Decline While Foreign Stocks Remain Steady

Initially, government bonds saw many parties selling due to reports that interest could be paid in Shanghai from today, but the principal would still have to wait for tariff revenue to accumulate. Category C bonds fell below 630 yuan, and miscellaneous bonds fell below 350 yuan. Later, with slight purchases from Northern traders, support was obtained. At noon, stimulated by the stock market, retail investors gradually became active, returning above the 700 yuan mark and closing at high prices. However, the result was still a slight decline compared to the previous close.

Chinese stocks saw strong prospects as the Securities Industry Association scheduled a founding meeting at the Chamber of Commerce on Sunday. Eighty old brokers had also gathered the day before. New parties actively participated, making the lineup strong. Two major players in the securities industry, Yongsha and Xinguang, exerted special effort, making prices extremely brilliant. Xinguang, due to a careless factory address, initially fell to 34 yuan, with supply exceeding demand, ranking behind Jingfu by more than 2 yuan. Later, major players intervened to boost the market, and retail investors also followed suit, immediately rebounding to above 40 yuan, still leading the small rally. The yarn factory also had major new players joining, making it much more vibrant than Meiya. With demand exceeding supply, many closed at high prices at noon. As a result, Yongsha rose 40 yuan compared to the previous close, Meiya only 5 yuan, Jingfu 2 yuan, Qinxing 1 yuan, and Xinguang remained flat. However, buying interest did not cease in the afternoon, with Yongsha rising to 730 yuan, Meiya to 565 yuan, and Xinguang to 43 yuan. The major players' boost greatly excited people.

Foreign stocks initially showed weakness due to some parties selling, but securities firms still absorbed them, and investors continued their efforts. At noon, they remained steady. As a result, results were mixed compared to the previous close. Supply and demand were still balanced, and trading gradually increased. However, market prices varied considerably due to differing supply and demand at each firm.

### Brief Statistics

### Northern and Southern Traders Actively Trade; Flour Market Active; Rice Market Stable

Yesterday, the rice market saw balanced arrivals and sales, with some shipments to the north. Soybean Xinghua traders actively traded, and prices rose by 200-300 yuan. Flour saw smooth purchases by both northern and southern traders, making the market active and rising by over 100 yuan. Soybean cake continued to be loaded in Taiwan, making it very popular, rising by another 200-300 yuan. Shantou's local street saw sluggish sales due to the flat oil market. However, demand from Ningbo and Fujian was strong, causing prices to tighten by several hundred to one thousand yuan. Red sorghum was scarce, rising by 100 yuan. Raw peanuts, with Nanjing, Yangzhou, and Qingdao as major production areas, saw only sporadic arrivals, insufficient to meet demand.

### Yarn Sales Weaken

Yesterday, the yarn market was flat. Although prices briefly surged in the morning, rising by 20,000, they fell back due to profit-taking retailers offering substantial sales. The closing price was similar to the previous day. However, customer sales were weaker, sentiment turned bearish, and the trend seemed less strong than in previous days.

### Yellow Croaker Sold at Reduced Prices

(Our report) The Shanghai District Enemy and Puppet Property Handling Bureau will sell yellow croaker at flat prices today. Large yellow croaker, previously priced at 112 yuan per catty, is now reduced to 96 yuan, and small yellow croaker will be sold at 80 yuan per catty.

The bureau previously stipulated that 50,000 bolts of flat-priced cloth would be delivered to the Central Trust Bureau for sale in Chongqing. However, due to transportation difficulties, it has now changed to transport 30,000 bolts to Chongqing, 10,000 bolts to Nanjing, and 10,000 bolts to Hankou for flat-priced sales.

### Revival of Sino-US Trade

Large Quantities of Products Awaiting Shipment to the US

### More Declines than Rises in Woolen Fabrics; Some Purchases by Foreign Traders

The woolen fabric market has been slightly more active recently. Due to some purchases by traders from South China, North China, and Sichuan, transactions are not lonely. However, most prices have seen more declines than rises. Slightly rising items include Yuanzhi tribute cloth, Chunhua cloth, gabardine, and uniform cloth. Declining items include overcoat cloth, thick flat cloth, ____ cloth, camel silk, colored tribute cloth, grass green goods, horse ____ silk ____, long-haired velvet, Harris tweed, herringbone ____, etc. Local street trading remains stagnant, with actual sales ____. With winter sales mostly over, both woolen fabric and suit industries are seeking to sell goods for profit, and the cash flow of various stores has loosened, with discounted bills falling from 30% to 10%.

### Market Situation Highlights

The sugar market was previously prosperous due to large purchases by Hankou traders, but is now gradually declining, with also a large quantity of arrivals and a trend toward stability.

Imported paper is seeing daily increases due to financial fluctuations and frequent purchases from other ports.

Knitted goods have recently seen demand exceeding supply, with customers actively seeking them out and prices continuing to rise compared to before.

### Economic Briefs

The Biscuit, Candy, Canned Goods, and Bread Industry Association, after Mr. Xian Guansheng, Le Doucheng, Feng Yixiang, Gu Bingyuan, and Ma Hanwen were appointed as organizing committee members under the instructions of the Social Affairs Bureau, has now begun work and is handling member registration.

The Iron Printing and Can Manufacturing Industry, after Wei Jiuqing, Wu Shaowu, Chen Shaonan, Wu Renji, and Wang Hexuan were appointed as organizing committee members and began organizing, saw other related industries, such as the manufacture of soft tubes, bottle caps, and steel refining factories, applying to join the association one after another. Therefore, the number of members has increased compared to before the war.

The Shanghai industrial and commercial sectors, in order to promote Shanghai-Korea trade, are organizing a delegation to Korea for inspection. This has now been approved by the Shanghai Social Affairs Bureau, and the delegation is expected to depart in mid-January of next year.

The 25th of this month is the anniversary of the Yunnan Uprising. Banks, money shops, and major companies and factories in Shanghai will take a day off as usual.

The various industry associations in Shanghai have agreed that industry trade regulations must be submitted to the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau for approval before they can be formally implemented.

Since the Ministry of Finance revised the commodity tax rate and announced a slight increase of 100% in the cigarette tax, more than 60 small-scale Chinese cigarette factories in Shanghai have been greatly alarmed and have jointly submitted a letter to the Shanghai Political and Chang Bureau, requesting reconsideration.

### Small Enemy Factories Valuation Commences

(Our special report) The Shanghai District Enemy and Puppet Property Handling Bureau's bidding for 47 small factories has long been noticed by various parties. Manufacturers returning to Shanghai from the rear are requesting priority purchase, and the society organized by these technicians has also expressed its intention to take over management. The Shanghai Dyeing and Weaving Industry Association, etc., stated that many factories in Shanghai were destroyed during the war and also requested to purchase them at flat prices to resume production. Most of these are chemical factories, followed by textile and iron and electrical materials factories, etc. To ensure thoroughness, the Handling Bureau has organized a valuation committee, hiring experts from various industries to verify estimates. The organization is divided into chemical, textile, machinery, and land groups, which have held several meetings and discussed matters in groups, with the aim of handling matters with a fair and rigorous attitude. It is heard that the valuation of several chemical factories, iron factories, and textile factories has been completed and will be submitted to the review committee for review. It is said that the original cost is generally used as the standard, with appropriate discounts based on the season and quantity of the goods. Machinery, factory buildings, etc. are leveled according to depreciation rates and the age of their use. In the coming days, they will also investigate and evaluate the remaining factories separately, completing this work by the end of the national calendar year.

### Reasons for Delayed Distribution of Enemy and Puppet Materials Bonuses

[Our report] Since the restoration, there have been regulations for secret reports and bonuses for enemy and puppet materials. It is understood that there are no fewer than one thousand such cases. The bonus amount needs to be determined by evaluating the recovered materials, which is a cumbersome procedure, and the responsible agency does not have anyone specifically dedicated to this task, so most of these bonuses have not yet been distributed.

### The Headmasters of Private Primary and Secondary Schools in This City State the Difficulties of Private Schools, Envoy Niu Promises to Forward the Report to the Central Government

[This City News] Yesterday afternoon at 3 PM, over 140 headmasters from private primary and secondary schools in this city, including Nanmo, Minguo, Daozhong, Nanyang, Mingde, Aiguo, Shenghuo, Kunfan, and Cunde, gathered at the Hongmian Restaurant to host Envoys Ye and Niu, as well as Committee Chairman Pan Gongzhan, Committee Chairman Wu Shaoshu, Education Vice-Minister Hang Liwu, Bureau Chief Gu Yuxiu, and Deputy Bureau Chief Li Ximou. Envoy Ye was unable to attend due to illness. Jiang Shaozhou first delivered an opening speech, followed by Envoy Niu, who stated briefly:

Niu Envoy's Address

"This time in Shanghai, the Chairman instructed me to investigate and inquire about the hardships in various aspects. Important matters should be referred for instructions, while the rest should be resolved locally or by the relevant departments. There is a traditional Chinese taboo against knowing something but not speaking up, leading to many misunderstandings. I hope you will all offer your opinions as much as possible. It would be best to have a written report, which can be forwarded to the central government as a document of our visit. As for schools, whether public or private, they are essentially the same. Private schools can supplement what the state cannot, and their contributions are truly great. I hope you will all uphold your original intentions and carry them forward." Next, Education Vice-Minister Hang delivered a speech.

Hang Education Vice-Minister's Address

"I deeply admire your hard work and perseverance during the past eight years. In this period of national reconstruction, talent is needed, and education is the source of talent, as detailed in Chairman's book, "China's Destiny." Going forward, you should pay attention to two points: (1) We are now in a new era, and new education methods should be used. Film and radio are extremely effective. (2) Physical education and group education are essential. Without a healthy body and a cooperative mindset, construction is impossible. We felt this weakness in the nation during the eight years of resistance." Next, Committee Chairman Pan delivered a speech.

Pan Committee Chairman's Address

"I have overseen education in this city in the past, and I am an old friend to you all. While in Chongqing, I knew that you all remained steadfast during the eight years. Now, under the leadership of Bureau Chief Gu and Deputy Bureau Chief Li, we will certainly be able to expand further. Recently, the administrative aspects have been unified. In this new era of new construction, the most important issues are school sites, funding, teachers, and equipment. To run a perfect school, none of these can be lacking. However, these four issues are currently thorny. Dishonest merchants hoarding goods and speculating are still loudly complaining about hardship, unaware that the truly distressed during the war were those in the education sector. It would be best to solicit donations from these wealthy merchants to find a solution." Afterwards, Bureau Chief Gu and Deputy Bureau Chief Li delivered speeches in succession. Zhou Feicheng, representing the Municipal Education Association, expressed his opinions. Subsequently, the headmasters of various schools separately described the difficulties faced by private schools and submitted a

Joint Petition

The joint petition from the private primary and secondary schools requested that Envoys Ye and Niu forward it to the central government. The key points of the original petition are as follows: (1) Request the government to earnestly support the development of private schools. (2) Request an increase in tuition fees for private schools. (3) Formulate laws and regulations to protect school buildings and ensure their effective implementation. (4) Request commendations for principals and teachers who faithfully adhered to laws and regulations and steadfastly remained in their positions during the war. (5) Request an increase in the number of education representatives in local public opinion organs, such as the Municipal Council. Envoy Niu promised to forward the petition. Finally, Zhang Tianbai delivered a thank-you speech, and the meeting adjourned.

### The First Verdict in the Traitor Case, Chen Riping Conspires with the Enemy, Sentenced to Life Imprisonment, Deprivation of Civil Rights for Life, All Property Confiscated

Chen Riping, a traitor who held positions in the puppet Legislative Yuan and other puppet posts, was sentenced yesterday afternoon at 3 PM by the collegiate panel of the Provisional High Court in Tilanqiao. The audience was extremely crowded. Chen Riping's daughter, Chen Yizhen, was also among the listeners. Chen Riping's defense lawyer, Qian Naiwen, also arrived on time. At 3 PM sharp, Court President Liu, Judge Cao, Judge Zhu, Prosecutor Lin, and Recorder Wang entered the court. Chen Riping was escorted in by court police. Court President Liu said, "Chen Riping, today your verdict will be announced. If you do not agree, you may request a retrial within ten days." Then he stood up and read the

Verdict

The text read: "Chen Riping is in collusion with an enemy country, plotting to resist this country, sentenced to life imprisonment, deprivation of civil rights for life, confiscation of all property, and the confiscation of a commemorative medal from the puppet Reformed Government and a badge from the Shanghai Special City Advisory Committee."

Held Multiple Puppet Positions

Chen Riping is currently 59 years old, from Zhongshan County, Guangdong Province. He was born in Yokohama, Japan, and graduated from Waseda University in Tokyo. He returned to China in 1920 and practiced law at the intersection of North Sichuan Road and Chongming Road. In the second year of the War of Resistance Against Japan (1938), he was enticed by a Japanese man named Osada Shigeru to serve as a "Legislative Member" of the puppet Reformed Government. He then served as "Permanent Vice Minister of the Ministry of Finance," "Supervisor of the Huaxing Bank," "Director of the Economic Department of the First District Office of Shanghai," "Member of the Shanghai Special City Advisory Committee," and "Vice President" of the former Xinwen Daily. Chen Riping's repeated service in puppet positions constitutes a violation of Article 2, Paragraph 1 of the Regulations for the Punishment of Traitors, which prohibits collusion with an enemy country and plotting to resist one's own country. Chen Riping's life sentence marks the first traitor case verdict in this city.

The total revenue of the Finance Bureau was approximately 16 million yuan in September, 11.3 million yuan in October, and 27.8 million yuan in November. The total monthly expenditures of the Municipal Government were over 56 million yuan in September, 107.9 million yuan in October, and approximately 127.8 million yuan in November.

Operation Committee Organization Completed

[This Newspaper] The organization of the Municipal Real Estate Operation Committee has been completed, with Huang Boqiaozu serving as the chairman.

### Central Committee Member Wu Kaixian Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday from Chongqing

Central Committee Member Wu Kaixian left Chongqing yesterday morning and arrived at Longhua Airport in Shanghai at 5 PM. Many of Wu's friends gathered at the airport to welcome him. After disembarking, Wu immediately drove to his private residence on McKinley Road for rest. During the early stages of the Anti-Japanese War, Wu was appointed to Shanghai to direct the party and government work behind enemy lines in the Southeast, and his achievements were remarkable. In March 1942, he was arrested by the Japanese military police, who used all kinds of cruel tortures to persecute him, but Wu remained loyal, steadfast, and never yielded. He attempted suicide several times in prison but was prevented each time. After being imprisoned for over a year, he escaped from Shanghai and went to Chongqing in the spring of 1943. The central authorities greatly comforted him. Wu stayed in Chongqing for over two years. Today, he is reunited with people in Shanghai, and he expresses his heartfelt joy.

### Garrison Headquarters Rectifies Military Discipline, Strictly Prohibits Impersonation and Extortion

Li Jilan, Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the Songhu Garrison, stated in a speech yesterday: "The main tasks of this headquarters in the past three months have been to stabilize the local area and rectify military discipline. Among the officers of this headquarters, Song Tingzhu, the mortar company commander of the special service regiment, and Ni Ying, the special service chief, have been sentenced to death for violating discipline. Chen Zihua, a lieutenant colonel staff officer, and Zhang Linken, a lieutenant adjutant, have been sentenced to imprisonment for taking advantage of their positions to fraudulently obtain property. Chen Shouchang, the commander of the special service regiment, and others are currently detained pending trial. All of this is sufficient to demonstrate Commander-in-Chief Qian's emphasis on rectifying military discipline. However, in recent months, four cases of impersonation of the names of the inspection office and the military law office of this headquarters for extortion have been discovered. One case involved impersonating the inspection office to affix seals without authorization. Another case involved impersonating the military law office and detaining people on Pubushi Road. All of the above have been captured. In addition, Lu Wenzhi, who impersonated the deputy director of the military law office, defrauded Xu Renfu of 11,400 legal currency at No. 36, Lane 242, Tiantong Road. He Huaqiang, who impersonated a major inspector of the military law office, is recruiting labor externally, and we are still ordering our subordinates to strictly investigate and handle the case. We hereby solemnly declare that there is no position of deputy director in the military law office of this headquarters. Since its establishment, whether accepting any case or not, we only handle it according to the law and never send anyone to mediate. If there are unscrupulous officers and soldiers extorting money or bandits impersonating the name of this headquarters to extort money, they may be reported to the nearby military police at any time for arrest and strict handling by this headquarters, and the facts may be reported to the confidential mailbox of this headquarters (P.O. Box 218, Shanghai General Post Office)."

### Taiwan's Foreign Trade: Merchants Allowed Free Shipping, Except for Controlled Coal, Sugar, Rice, etc.

The Taiwan Provincial Administrative Chief's Office in Shanghai stated that Taiwan's administrative authorities have decided on foreign trade measures that, excluding controlled goods such as coal, sugar, and rice, as well as specialized items like tobacco and alcohol, merchants can freely trade and ship exports. However, due to a shortage of ships and the unresolved exchange rate between the legal tender (法幣) and the Taiwan currency (台幣), there is currently no large-scale trade. The exchange rate between the Taiwan currency and the legal tender is currently being submitted by the Taiwan administrative authorities to the central authorities for a decision. Lu Zongxian, Xu Benchun, and four others from the Resources Committee assigned to work in Taiwan, and Xu Zhengyi from the Shanghai branch of the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, will all fly to Taiwan on the 24th.

Large Quantities of Taiwanese Sugar Arrive

Since Taiwan's recovery, waterways have been cleared. In addition to outgoing shipments to transport coal, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company has dispatched the *Xin Ruian* and *Jiang Ning* vessels, carrying mostly relief supplies. The primary import is sugar. The Taiwan Customs Office has also been established, and the railway is being taken over. The total length of the province's railway is 4,085 kilometers, originally divided into the Western Trunk Line and the Taitung Line. Bridges in various locations have suffered significant damage. Recently, a portion has been temporarily repaired and opened to traffic, and materials are being awaited. It is expected that the entire line can be officially repaired in approximately three months. The Taiwan Provincial Trade Company has established an office in the Shanghai China Merchants Steam Navigation Company to facilitate commercial contact between Shanghai and Taiwan.

Sending Letters to Taiwan Using Airmail

The Shanghai Postal Administration announced that from December 25th of this year, China National Aviation Corporation aircraft will begin flights between Shanghai and Taiwan, flying from Shanghai to Taipei every Tuesday and returning to Shanghai on the same day, carrying mail. Currently, due to the scarcity of ships between Shanghai and Taiwan, the public should make full use of airmail to send letters and postcards to Taiwan for speed and efficiency.

### Encouraging Export Trade: Many Kinds of Goods are Exempt from Tax

Since the surrender of the Japanese army, shipping routes between our country and foreign countries have gradually been restored in a short period of time. As a result, the import and export trade of this port has gradually become prosperous. In order to encourage the export trade of local products, our government has granted tax-free export preferential treatment for many products such as honey, black tea, brick tea, coarse and fine summer cloth, sorghum, and millet, so that they can compete with foreign goods in the foreign market.

### Gas-Powered Shallow-Draft Vessel: Maiden Voyage Soon to Arrive in Shanghai

[Report from this newspaper] In order to remedy the difficulties of navigation in the Yongdao of the Sichuan River, which has many rapids and shoals, the Chongqing Huaxi Company began research in October 1943, using gas as a power source. By the spring of 1944, the gas design was completed, and with the assistance of the US military headquarters, the experiment was successful. The first vessel, *Meiya*, has been completed and is operating in rapids, with no difficulties going up or down. It departed Chongqing on its maiden voyage eastward on the 1st of this month and arrived in Hankou on the 8th and will soon arrive in Shanghai.

### Year-End Approaching: Human-Powered Vehicles to be Allowed on Nanjing Road Again

[Report from this newspaper] Since the prohibition of human-powered vehicles on Nanjing Road in this city, the business of shops along the road has been greatly affected. As the old and new years approach, the road remains deserted. Yesterday, Central Executive Committee member Pan Gongzhan and Councilor Xi Yushu, observing this situation, noted that American military vehicles already have a licensing system. Given that year-end goods purchasing must take into account the needs and convenience of merchants, the public, and the citizens. They jointly sent a letter to Mayors Qian and He, suggesting that the ban be temporarily lifted for two months starting from the 23rd of this month, to allow citizens to take various vehicles to purchase goods from shops on that road. This proposal has now attracted the attention of the municipal authorities. According to reliable sources, the municipal government is currently drafting a new traffic regulation for Nanjing Road, which will allow various human-powered vehicles to pass freely on Nanjing Road outside of specified hours. If this measure yields good results, it may be fully opened in the future.

### Relief Supplies: Transshipment from Shanghai to the Whole Country Begins, with Hankou, Tianjin, etc., as Distribution Centers

The supplies of the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, which were once piled up and congested in Shanghai's docks and warehouses, have now begun to be transported to islands and coastal areas in urgent need. Relief officials are quite satisfied that China's current situation has begun to gradually advance this work. The first batch of ships carrying 76,000 tons of relief supplies has been unloaded. Most of it is food, most of which has been moved from the docks, with only 11,000 tons remaining in warehouses, waiting to be transported to distribution centers in Hankou, Tianjin, Qinhuangdao, and Kowloon. A portion of the flour has been sold to the Kailuan Coal Mining Company near Tianjin. The company has doubled its coal production after obtaining this urgently needed flour. The Shanghai branch of the China Relief and Rehabilitation Administration will ship 20,000 tons of supplies out of Shanghai in the next two weeks. Food will be distributed by 15 branch offices, some of which will be provided free of charge to workers in public works projects. However, in areas where people have purchasing power, some scarce goods may be sold. The funds from the sales will be used to facilitate the repatriation of refugees and promote relief work in other areas. Some foreign refugees, most notably Jewish refugees, will receive assistance from the Shanghai branch of the China Relief and Rehabilitation Administration. In addition, some refugees have registered with the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration to await repatriation.

### Xinguang Underwear Factory: Fire Caused by Electrical Fault

[Report from this newspaper] The Xinguang Standard Underwear Dyeing and Weaving Finishing Factory at 216 Tangshan Road, Hongkou, suddenly caught fire yesterday morning. To understand the cause of the fire, reporters from this newspaper visited the person in charge of the factory. According to them, the factory's organization is divided into weaving, finishing, dyeing, and underwear sections, with more than 400 male and female workers in total, of which about 100 are in the underwear section. After the victory, trade was unhindered, and the sales of underwear could not meet the demand. In addition to daytime work, night shifts were added. Last night, after the usual night shift, the doors of the underwear section on the second floor were closed. Little did they know that at about 1:04 am, a fire suddenly broke out, rising to the roof and becoming unapproachable. As the wind was strong and the section was filled with raw materials, mostly semi-finished products, the fire was not extinguished until 3 am. The reporter went to the disaster site to inspect and saw several staff members leading workers in clearing and cleaning the rubble. The finishing room, preparation room, yarn twisting room, and many machines on the lower floor were damaged. It is reported that the cause of the fire was an electrical fault, and fortunately, no one was injured.

### First Sale of 50,000 Bags: Striving for Widespread Flour Sales, Each Retailer Can Apply for 50 Bags

[Report from this newspaper] The United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration has shipped seven ships of wheat to China, totaling over 45,000 tons, except for one ship (*East Bourne*) which is still being unloaded. The quality of this wheat is excellent. The Executive Yuan of our country and the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration have entrusted the Fuxin and Fufeng factories in this city to mill and bag the wheat and transport it to various parts of the country. In this city, in addition to the first phase of 50,000 bags that have already been sold, the second phase of applications began the day before yesterday. In the past two days, the number of registered individuals has reached more than 2,400. Today is the last day for registration. According to the person in charge of the temporary office of the Fuxin and Fufeng flour companies, which are handling the registration, the purpose of this sale is to be as widespread as possible, so the scope is wider than the first phase, and the amount of flour will also be increased. It is now divided into three types. First, retailers, bread and biscuit merchants, and consumer cooperatives can apply for a maximum of 50 bags. Second, noodle merchants and dessert shops can apply for a maximum of 20 bags per household. Third, flatbread stalls can apply for a maximum of 10 bags per stall. For convenience of examination, it is generally necessary to produce a business license issued by the Municipal Finance Bureau for this season.

The price for this phase is to be determined on the 27th.

### Minyu Vessel Suddenly Sank in the Huangpu River Yesterday Morning: Passengers Unharmed, Cargo and Luggage Lost

[Report from this newspaper] The Minsheng Company's *Minyu* vessel, originally scheduled to sail to Chongqing yesterday morning, was postponed to depart yesterday morning due to insufficient loading. Unexpectedly, around midnight yesterday morning, it suddenly began to take on water and sank. The details are recorded below:

Recently Repaired, Sailing to Chongqing

The *Minyu* vessel had a gross tonnage of 232 tons and was a riverboat sailing the Chongqing-Yibin route. The shipowner was Ningbo native Wang Fucheng, who also served as the first mate. The crew consisted of more than 40 people. At the end of October, the vessel left Chongqing to sail downstream. It was delayed in Hankou for a long time, arriving in Shanghai in early December. On the 4th, it arrived in Shanghai and entered the Jiangnan Shipyard for repairs. It was repaired on the 19th and moved to Wharf No. 3 on the Bund of Wuma Road to load cargo and passengers for Chongqing. It was originally scheduled to depart yesterday morning, but due to procedural issues, the loading was delayed until the day before yesterday. It loaded 97 pieces of cotton yarn, 21 pieces of cotton cloth, 80 barrels of diesel, 100 cans of machine oil, totaling 464 pieces of cargo, totaling over 60 tons. According to the vessel's capacity, it was loaded about 15% less than its capacity, so the draft was not heavy. There were only 65 passengers. The cargo was loaded at about 7 o'clock, and the passengers boarded the ship at 9 o'clock. The crew had already rested.

Tilting to Starboard and Sinking Immediately

Around midnight, the ship's body tilted to starboard, and the tide water penetrated the rear shackle hole and immediately flowed into the cargo hold. Passengers sleeping on the cargo hold were shocked and shouted loudly. The crew heard the news and rushed to the rescue, using buckets to scoop out the water, but more water came in than could be scooped out. For a time, there was no way to stop the water, and the order was in chaos. The passengers then landed in the chaos. The tide surged in from the rear hatch into the engine room. In a blink of an eye, the same amount of water entered the front cabin. The crew also went ashore and watched the ship sink. Within a quarter of an hour, the entire ship was submerged, with only the top of the ship and the chimney left out of the water. All the cargo and luggage were submerged. Fortunately, no one was injured.

The Company is Salvaging

After dawn, the company was notified. The company immediately discussed the matter with the Jiangnan Shipyard. Two wooden barges and two underwater workers were dispatched to enter the cabin and salvage objects. By the evening, 11 pieces of cotton yarn, 6 barrels of diesel, and many clothes and miscellaneous items had been salvaged. Salvage operations will continue today. After the cargo is salvaged and the ship's body is lightened, methods will be found to salvage the vessel. The company believes that the accident is very bizarre, considering that the vessel had just been repaired and that the cargo was not heavily loaded. It is currently being investigated. Those who have purchased tickets for the *Minyu* vessel can transfer to the *Minzu* vessel, which is scheduled to depart on the 24th.

### Vehicles Drive on the Right in Yucheng: Printing Clear Pictures

The Municipal Police Department, in view of the fact that vehicles across the country will be driving on the right starting on January 1, 1946, has posted slogans all over the main streets in order to get citizens to pay attention in advance. Yesterday, it also produced a large number of eye-catching and clear pictures, which were posted outside bustling areas, companies, and business showrooms. It has also designated the hand gestures for drivers and the hand gestures for traffic police. It stipulates that the maximum speed for vehicles driving in the city is 5 kilometers per hour, and the maximum speed outside the city must not exceed 50 kilometers. The distance between the front and rear vehicles must be up to 5 meters in the city and not allowed to drive within 50 meters outside the city. Specific methods have also been specified for turning vehicles in great detail.

### Pedestrian Hit by Tram

(Report from this newspaper) At about 6 pm yesterday at the foot of the old garbage bridge on North Zhejiang Road, a Route 5 tram traveling there from north to south hit three pedestrians, Liu Deshui, Liao Jiayou, and Zhou Chengwen, who could not avoid it in time, knocking them to the ground and injuring their feet and waists. Later, the police officers from the Old Zhabei Branch sent them to Renji Hospital for treatment.

### Robbery on West Guangfu Road: One Thief Captured During Robbery

[Report from this newspaper] At about 7:15 pm yesterday, six bandits came to the home of villager Zhang Xianquan at No. 3 Zhangjia Bridge, West Guangfu Road, Zhabei. Fortunately, the neighbors discovered it and shouted loudly. The bandits panicked and fled out the door. The last bandit was finally captured by the victim and his gun was snatched. He then fired the gun, hitting the bandit in the abdomen. He was bleeding non-stop and fell to the ground and was captured. The rest of the bandits all fled and disappeared. The nearby police station was notified afterwards, and the injured thief was sent to the Red Cross Hospital by car and then transferred to the police hospital for treatment.

### Japanese Residents Management Office Holds Women's Forum: Reviewing All Aspects of the Awareness Movement

— Mai Tian

Yesterday morning at 10 o'clock, the Japanese Residents Management Office held a Japanese women's forum in the auditorium of the office on Dixwei Road. More than a dozen Japanese women intellectual leaders were present, and more than 20 representatives from the women's community and reporters from this city were specially invited to participate.

The topic discussed at the forum was: "The Japanese Women's Awareness Movement." Mr. Wang Guanghan, the director of the office, said: "The times are advancing, and the demand to achieve equality between men and women is necessary. But how can we achieve true equality between men and women? Everyone can discuss it with each other as much as possible today."

Japanese Men and Women Must Be Liberated

The women's forum was started by a Japanese man, Sota, whose opinion was that regarding the liberation of Japan, not only women should be liberated, but men should also be liberated. He believes that liberation should start from two principles. First, the liberation of mankind. Second, women should be liberated by men. Because in today's society and politics, men have all kinds of priority rights, so men must give women the right to participate, and mainly start with how men oppress women. Ms. Yamagishi Takako then expressed her grand theory. She said that she herself had not been oppressed by men, but she had been oppressed by the family. She feels that women leaving their families and farmers going to cities to engage in industry is the same principle. This phenomenon exists in all countries in the world now, and Japanese women should not fall behind. Next, Mrs. Zeita expressed her views. She believes that (1) Japanese women are too indifferent to participating in politics. (2) Women's opinions are different from men's, and it is worth considering whether participation in politics will affect national affairs, so she hopes that Japanese women in the future will, on the one hand, cultivate and study knowledge by themselves, and understand domestic and foreign affairs clearly in order to participate in politics, and on the other hand, require the country to be impartial between men and women.

Bearing Responsibility for All Misfortune

Mr. Tokuda got up again to add a few words, recounting the history of the Japanese women's movement. Then, Ms. Huang Daping of the local court stood up and said that the country belongs to every citizen, and women should also bear responsibility. And women's love of peace is stronger than men's. All rights cannot be abandoned.

Ms. Yamagishi immediately jumped up to challenge her. She said that Japan should bear responsibility for all the misfortunes it has caused. However, if we say that women's love of peace is stronger than men's, that seems a bit untrue. Another Japanese female youth leader who studied in the United States, Naito Takashi, felt that women's issues should be regarded as an obligation.

Advising Japanese Women on Two Points

After Ms. Yamagishi finished speaking, Ms. Zhuang Keling, the director of the female youth group of the Sanqing League, stood up to explain and prove how women love peace. She finally advised Japanese women on two points: first, in the future, we must continue to strive to eliminate slavery. Second, go back to educate the people and improve the past aggressive education. Yamagishi had to express that she represented Japanese women in apologizing to Chinese women and accepted the opinions. Other representatives from the Education Bureau, Ms. Shangguan Yu, and Ms. Pu Dagong of Women's Monthly also followed Ms. Zhuang's meaning and gave Japanese women some faithful advice before the meeting was dismissed.

Not Knowing Much About China

After the meal, the Japanese Residents Management Office also invited Chinese women representatives and reporters to go to Wusong to hold a forum with the Japanese female soldiers of the Flower Garden troops. From the conversations of various people, a conclusion was reached: they all believed that they did not know much about China. They all hope to live in China often. They will go back and tell their sisters all the good things about China and the Chinese people.

However, we must not forget that although Japan has been defeated, their national character and the aggressive education they have received have not changed at all. They are still dangerous things. One female soldier asked us why uneducated women in China are very close to them, but highly educated women are cold to them? It can be seen what kind of edification they have received. Have they been "self-conscious"?

Since the Japanese surrender, Japanese women have gradually been able to rise from the oppression of the traditional system. The Japanese Residents Management Office in this city, in view of the importance of women's issues, specially convened a Japanese women's forum yesterday. Many Japanese intellectual leaders and representatives from the women's community in this city participated, which is of great significance.

Movies and Theater

### The Rebirth of Film and Drama

— Ling

For the past eight years, film production organizations in the occupied territories, controlled by the enemy and puppet regimes, along with some theater performances influenced by them, have now been eliminated with the surrender of the enemy. Before us lies a vast, open field, and some broken props. Everything awaits our transformation and creation, so that the dead film and drama life can be awakened anew.

We need film and drama, but it must be reborn. It must keep pace with this great era. We will not only be satisfied with crushing the enemy's and puppet regime's usurpation, but we will also eliminate those outdated and degenerate parasites.

The establishment of the new "Film and Drama" truly involves countless threads, which cannot be completely covered in a single piece of paper. Therefore, we have decided not to fear the complexity and start from scratch. Starting this week, Shen Bao is opening up this valuable garden to us—to all enthusiasts of film and drama, allowing us all to use it as a horticultural experimental field to support the rebirth of film and drama. We hope to nurture this garden with the passionate emotion of looking forward to the completion of the rebirth of film and drama.

The reborn "Film and Drama" will soon become readers' close friends. We will meet once every Sunday.

### "Boundless Future" Overture

— Jishi

"Boundless Future" is a valuable work produced during the Pacific War. It is a major anti-Japanese production by the Central Film Studio. The screen unfolds the story of a group of young people staying in the South, struggling to make ends meet. They have nothing, only a patriotic passion and group firepower. They fight the environment, and they are all searching for a bright path. Then, our heroine appears. She appears under the dim streetlights, a poignant and stunning Southern beauty, whose circumstances are like that of a beautiful woman with a tragic fate. Her happy family was shattered by the artillery fire of the brutal enemy. She was washed up in the South and forced into prostitution, spending her days in tears. She escaped and was rescued by these poor young people, escaping the devil's den. However, a distorted society led her down a crooked path. She went to the stage, and her natural beauty and talent made her a singing and dancing star. The director forced her to wear less and less clothing, and she had no choice but to leave and join the "Boundless Future" on the "Road to the Front."

The chance encounter between the male lead, Li Qing, and the female lead, Rong Xiaoyi, is a lyrical poem written with blood and tears, but during this time, there is no "I love you" kind of cheesy performance. There is only a tacit understanding that the naked eye cannot see.

In this film full of tragic atmosphere, relaxed humor and innocent comedic elements are added from time to time. The greatest contribution comes from Li Pai's comedic actor Li Jingbo and the child star Rong Rong, who is less than three feet tall. Audiences will like them after meeting them.

The film exposes the inside story of the dark society everywhere. This is director Cai Chusheng's masterpiece. Those who have seen "Song of the Fishermen" and "The Lost Lamb" will also like this film. Because it not only freely expresses his anti-Japanese consciousness, but also retains the "Chusheng" atmosphere of the Cai family's old shop. You can smell it from the screen.

Finally, let us not neglect the film's various contrasting and alternating styles, such as lightness in seriousness, comedy in tragedy, song and dance in tension, vernacular in Mandarin, and light in darkness, showing that this film is a comprehensive and quintessential masterpiece. There are three interludes: "Boundless Future Theme Song," "Song of Eight Hundred Heroes," and Rong Xiaoyi's sentimental song.

The film is scheduled to be released in Shanghai on New Year's Day. Let us wait and see!

Film Review

### About "Night Shop"

— Shao Zijie

To be honest, I have to admit that "Night Shop" is a high-standard play. Throughout the play is the life of the dregs of humanity. They are all too miserable. Society has pushed them into hell. It is not that they do not know love or hate. On the contrary, they did once have hope and were willing to sacrifice. However, reality makes them selfishly compete. As the editor said, "This is not a story, this is a society." Penetrating "Night Shop" is indeed living reality, the kind souls of the lower society.

Through the adaptation of the playwright, the characters, personalities, and atmosphere of "Night Shop" have indeed been more nationalized. However, regrettably, I have to wonder whether "Night Shop" will be suitable for our place. The characters in "Night Shop" are indeed commonly seen, but the gathering place of lower society life in the Night Shop is at least not very common in China.

"Night Shop" is revealing. Because of this, we can nakedly see their smiles and hear their cries. However, other than that, I don't believe that "Night Shop" will bring better guidance to the audience. "Night Shop" exposes the life of hell, but it does not tell us why they have to live so pitifully. As Mr. Shi Tuo said, since Night Shop is a corner of society, then regrettably, why is the Night Shop only like an independent society? Losing the connection between the society of "Night Shop" and the society that created "Night Shop," so that "Night Shop" only brings us a vague impression.

Strictly speaking, the plot of "Night Shop" seems too dull and monotonous, and the climax is not tense enough. Danny's interpretation of Sai Guanyin is still good, but the lines are too fast and not clear enough. Zhang Fa's Yang Qilang has too light a rogue spirit, and Ding Shan's Wen Taishi is very appropriate in his sinister nature.

Weekly Film Reviews

### Soul Journey in Dreams

— Huang Hua

Passage to Marseille

(Nanjing screening)

This is a wartime production of Warner Bros. Most of the plot takes place on a French liner sailing in the Atlantic. Free France and the Vichy puppet regime are the main points of contention in the play. The development of political disputes erupts into a naval and air battle, with a very strong atmosphere of artillery fire, especially with the cooperation of several famous actors, it is even more masterful. The intensity is simply raging like fire. The protagonist is Humphrye Bogart. His acting skills have improved to the point of perfection in recent years and he has won the title of movie emperor. Co-stars such as Claude Rains and horror star Peter Lorre are all top choices. The entire play uses flashbacks. The five dying people who were rescued from floating on the sea tell the story of their past adventures. They are all patriots of Free France. They and the captain agree to change course to London and no longer carry supplies back to Marseille to support the enemy puppets. This leads to a frontal artillery battle with Major Du, who is armed, followed by a tense climax of a lone boat fighting a single plane. And these stories are told by the French captain at the American air base, which can be said to be the ultimate in flashbacks. It is inevitable that viewers who do not understand English dialogue will feel confused. There is only one female character in the entire play, and the love scenes are very simple. The director focuses on the handling of scenes such as fighting, imprisonment, and escape. He exposes the cruelty and perversity of the Vichy puppet government, which sets off the strong will of the French patriotic people. The skillful handling of tense scenes is the characteristic of this film's director, and the existence of "Free Government" and "Vichy Puppet Government" in France is similar to the wartime phenomenon in China. After watching it, it is especially thought-provoking. As for this film, in terms of performance and in all aspects, it is worthy of being a masterpiece that deserves serious recommendation.

### Welcoming Shanghai

— Bai Yang

It has been eight years since I left Shanghai. When I got off the plane, Shanghai was still so prosperous and so complete. It seemed that the war had given it special treatment and did not cause any damage to it. I don't know whether it is joy or sadness in my heart. This reunion gives me a general feeling that I can't express.

For eight years in the rear, most of the time was spent in the capital, which was shrouded in thick fog. There, everything was simple, poor, and inconvenient; especially in the theater, it was simply simple to the point of having nothing. In that environment, I have been following many friends and have been struggling for eight years. Looking back, it's like a dream!

Now that I am back in Shanghai, we will have an excellent working environment. I hope to quickly get to know the friends who have been sticking to their posts under the oppression of the enemy and puppets for many years, and I hope that the drama people who are stranded in the rear will come to Shanghai quickly. We will unite the front and rear and work together for our drama!

### Shirley Temple's Marriage

Shirley Temple, the child star who was famous in the film industry before the war, is now a graceful young woman. She is eighteen years old. According to the Chinese calendar, she is already a nineteen-year-old girl. American girls all have romances, let alone Alan, who is both beautiful and rich. If she doesn't cause a stir, she doesn't. Once she causes a stir, she hits the jackpot. It can also be said that she is an expert in the crash course. Her target is Sergeant John, a U.S. Air Force sergeant who is six feet two inches tall (of course it is John, how many Americans are not called John). His name is George Agar. This Agar guy is really a lucky guy. He is really blessed with beauty. They are officially engaged. However, according to the spokesperson of the woman's family (Shirley's parents), "Alan and Agar have signed a gentleman's agreement, deciding not to marry within two years, so that both parties can stand on their positions and pursue their own careers," and so on. I hereby announce the above.

### "Mussolini" Divorce News

Jacques Auclair, the comedic star who played Mussolini in "The Great Dictator," has long been called Mussolini by people in Hollywood. At first, he was very happy that people called him by this name, but since Mussolini was hanged, old Jacques felt terrified and had no appetite. Presumably, Mussolini's ghost was haunting him all the time. (Why doesn't he buy some ingots and burn them? Really—) Recently, he suddenly had a whim and divorced his wife of nine years (who is also an actress). I remember that they got married on a train back then, which was once a story told by Americans.

### Quitting Smoking is a Major Social Problem. Requesting this Column to Publish Common Sense on Quitting Smoking to Guide Blacklisted Smokers Through the Maze

A letter from our reader Xi Liyan reads: "Editor, the enemy puppets implemented a poisoning policy during the war, openly selling and consuming opium and heroin, resulting in countless people becoming addicted to drugs. After the victory, smoking bans have long been announced, and smokers in Shanghai are limited to quitting by the end of February next year. Those who fail to quit by the deadline will be severely punished according to law. The government strictly prohibits it, and smokers must quit. But smokers who have gone astray and become addicted unknowingly suffer from economic oppression and mental pain. Everyone wants to extricate themselves and quit at all times, but there are more failures than successes. The advertisements for so-called smoking cessation hospitals: 'Three days to break the addiction, comfortable and painless,' are all lies. Many people cannot withstand the pain of quitting and give up halfway. Because the problem of quitting smoking is a major social problem, I specifically request your column to publish several articles of the 'Common Sense on Quitting Smoking' type to guide blacklisted smokers through the maze. It would be best to have an 'Worry-Free Theory of Quitting Smoking' like the 'Anti-Tuberculosis Lecture,' I think it will definitely be of great help to smokers who are about to reform. I wish you a smooth writing."

(Editor's note) Mr. Xi's opinion is very good, and he is indeed a person with good intentions. We hope that readers with smoking cessation experience will write some experiences to share with their peers. We also welcome medical experts to contribute some practical and effective methods for quitting smoking. As far as I know, the first thing to quitting smoking is "determination." If you quit and smoke again, no matter what effective medicine you have, you will never quit. Pay attention!

### Poor and Sick Students Please Establish a Sanatorium for Lung Diseases

Allocate Received Materials

To Cover Medical Equipment Costs

I am a young man from a bandit area in northern Jiangsu. I was originally studying at the Jiangsu Provincial Temporary Middle School in Tunxi, Anhui, but I recently stopped school and came to Shanghai due to coughing up blood. After arriving in Shanghai, I lived with a relative and borrowed some money to have an X-ray taken. According to the doctor, "It is mild tuberculosis, and it will slowly get better with only six months in the hospital." But we have been wandering for several years, and even eating is a problem. How can we think about staying in the hospital? So now I feel that the only way out is death.

Editor, I think you will definitely sympathize with people like us. In the rear and in schools in the southeast, there are many patients with lung diseases. In our school alone, there are more than 20 people who urgently need treatment. But they all have no money and can only wait for the arrival of the god of death. Our country needs talents to build the country. Can we just watch this group of loyal and pure young people who have moved around with the government die in vain?

I think the government authorities will not abandon the young people. Presumably, because there are many things to be done, they have not taken care of this. In the newspapers in the rear, I saw that Councilor X once suggested the universal establishment of sanatoriums to provide reasonable treatment for teachers and students in the academic world who are suffering from illness. However, the material conditions were not sufficient at that time, and it was not implemented. I think that today, after the victory, with the accumulation of received materials, it would not be a problem to allocate a portion to purchase medicines and medical equipment! Moreover, there are many enemy military hospitals, which are also suitable for conversion into sanatoriums. If the government does this, the people will definitely welcome it, and it can also preserve these main forces for future national construction—the youth.

Dear Editor, this is the call of all poor and sick young people. Please use a corner of your newspaper to disclose it. I think the wise government will definitely consider the situation and adopt public opinion.

### Modern Health Preservation Methods

— Fudingbao

Based on my observations of human longevity, I have determined that the reasons why people's lifespans are shortened are as follows:

(1) Worrying for one hour can shorten your lifespan by one day to six months.

(2) Fear and anger for one hour can shorten your lifespan by three days to one year.

(3) Getting sick once can shorten your lifespan by six days to five years.

(4) Grief for one hour can shorten your lifespan by three days to one year.

(5) One night of insomnia shortens your lifespan by five days.

(6) One ejaculation shortens your lifespan by ten days.

(7) Overindulgence once shortens your lifespan by fifteen days.

(8) Overworking for one day shortens your lifespan by two days.

(9) Breathing in polluted air for one day can shorten your lifespan by one day to one year.

Based on this, we know that we should try our best to avoid the above nine points, which can be a method of health preservation.
