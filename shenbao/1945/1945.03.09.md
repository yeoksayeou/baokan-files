### Close Cooperation Between Japanese Army and Navy Units; Fierce Battles on Both Wings of Luzon Island; Japanese Defenders on Batan Island Loyal to Their Country

Luzon Front, 8th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – The battle in the Clark Field area is becoming increasingly fierce. Although communication has been cut off for the Japanese forces, the army and navy defending units are working closely together, and their morale remains extremely high as they fight on intermittently. The enemy, eager to use the airfield, is concentrating all its artillery fire on the Japanese positions, launching repeated attacks, bombarding and shelling, and using tanks as a vanguard to advance at night. They are also employing flame throwers and white phosphorus smoke bombs, attempting to turn the area in front of the Japanese positions into a sea of flames and smoke. Furthermore, they are shelling from a distance of only 500 to 600 meters, destroying the Japanese positions. On the 5th, they again deployed tanks as a vanguard, concentrating artillery fire on the Japanese right flank, and repeatedly attacking the Japanese defending units with a dozen tanks. At dawn on the 6th, the Japanese launched a vigorous counterattack, repelling them.

Philippine Front, 8th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – The enemy forces in front of the Japanese strongholds in Manila have deployed approximately two divisions on the front lines, launching an attack. The focus appears to be on the Japanese left flank in the Antipolo area, where fierce fighting is currently underway. A portion of the enemy also began an offensive on the 2nd at noon with tanks and armored vehicles near Morong on the north shore of Laguna de Bay, but was repelled by the Japanese and suffered heavy losses. The enemy is still attempting to continue the offensive, and bandit groups in the area are becoming increasingly active. On the 6th, enemy forces constructed attack points in front of the Japanese positions near Montalban, which were shattered by the Japanese attack. The Japanese are currently continuing the attack and expanding their gains.

Philippine Front, 8th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – The Japanese forces on Batan Island, south of Luzon, have been fighting alone since the enemy landed in early January. After two months of fierce fighting and inflicting heavy losses on the enemy, only 47 Japanese soldiers, including the commander, remained alive. On the morning of March 2nd, they sent a telegram stating that all the soldiers on the island were carrying out a final assault, and it is now feared that they have all died for their country.

### Enemy Ships Laden with Wounded Soldiers Sail Out of Lingayen Gulf

Luzon Front Base, 8th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – Enemy hospital ships entering and leaving Lingayen Gulf have been very frequent recently. A 15,000-ton hospital ship entered the port on February 10th and hurriedly left the port within three days, fully loaded with wounded and sick soldiers. It re-entered the port on March 2nd and left on the 3rd. Another hospital ship entered the port on the 4th. From this, it can be seen that the enemy is overwhelmed by the Japanese war of attrition and is struggling to care for the wounded and sick. It can also be inferred that the American troops are experiencing a terror of Japanese attacks beyond our imagination. The enemy is also forcibly using Filipino civilians to wage guerrilla warfare against the Japanese, making every effort to obstruct the appearance of Japanese assault troops. During battles, they use black soldiers as shields to ensure their own safety, employing all kinds of tactics. However, Japanese solo assault soldiers break through all obstacles and continue to slay. Judging by the frequent entry and exit of enemy hospital ships and the sharp increase in cross-marked graves along the front lines, it is evident that the results of the Japanese war effort are gradually expanding.

Lisbon, 8th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – A dispatch from Washington reports that U.S. Army Surgeon General Norman Kirk announced on the 7th the alarming increase in American casualties as follows: Currently, an average of 1,200 wounded soldiers are being sent back to the U.S. mainland from overseas battlefields every day. In February, the number of wounded soldiers arriving in the U.S. mainland reached as many as 35,000, and it is expected that this will increase by 4,000 in March. Last October, U.S. Army hospitals accommodated 87,000 patients, which has now surged to 140,000.

### "The Rabaul Decisive Battle Instructions": One Against a Hundred, Fight Courageously and Kill the Enemy

Tokyo, 8th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – The soldiers of the elite Japanese garrison in Rabaul have constructed a 100-meter underground tunnel and established a perfect self-sufficient state, awaiting the enemy's arrival. A certain Japanese staff officer flew back to the country on the 11th in an aircraft recently manufactured in the Rabaul cave to make contact. The staff officer introduced the "Rabaul Decisive Battle Instructions" of the Japanese soldiers in that area to the domestic population. The instructions were promulgated to the entire army by the highest commander in the area on December 8th of last year, the day of the Great Edict's Proclamation. An introduction of its content is as follows:

"Decisive Battle Instructions" (1) Inevitable Victory Through Vigorous Training: The belief in inevitable victory arises from mortal training, making the spirit of one against a hundred manifest without reservation. The fierce battle on Palau Island was by no means something that could be achieved through training in a single day. All our soldiers should strive to practice martial arts and cultivate the ability to surely kill and surely win. They must have the determination to kill the enemy before the battle. (2) The Creed of Officers: Officers are the center of the morale of the army. They must always fulfill their unshakable mission with a sense of responsibility and an unwillingness to retreat. They must take the lead in the most brutal battles, as this is the true face of an officer. They must always lead by example, infusing their beliefs and spirit into their subordinates, so that their subordinates can achieve this ambition. (3) The Creed of Non-Commissioned Officers: As battles become increasingly fierce, officers will be lost one after another. Then, non-commissioned officers must rise up and take their place, commanding the battle. This is the norm on the battlefield. The achievements of the Palau Island charge and melee combat were also due to the non-commissioned officers leading a small number of troops to command. All armies with non-commissioned officers should always hold the ambition of an officer in their daily lives, forming the core of martial arts training and laying the foundation for inevitable victory. (4) The Creed of Soldiers: Soldiers should kill the enemy as one against a hundred and never retreat. If the battle is fierce and the commanding officer is lost, they must take command and fight bravely. If weapons are damaged and ammunition is exhausted, they should bite the enemy to death with their bare hands. Retreating or being captured is more shameful than being unfaithful or unfilial. If this is the case, then how can we face the comrades who sleep peacefully in the Yasukuni Shrine? (5) All-Out Attack in a Desperate Battle: Advancing is death, retreating is death. If you want to survive in death, you must make a deadly attack. All soldiers should rise up and advance, striving to kill the enemy. (6) View of Life and Death: The great spirit of loyalty to the country is to see through life and death. The loyal and sincere fighting spirit of Da Nan Gong (Kusunoki Masashige) is the teaching of "seven lives to repay the country." We should inherit the fighting spirit of the fallen comrades on Palau Island, fight bravely and kill the enemy as one against a hundred, so that it will be forever engraved in the hearts of the people.

Editorial

### The Issue of Layoffs and Salary Increases

Recently, various institutions, organizations, and industries in this city have been implementing layoffs and salary increases, streamlining their organizations, and laying off personnel in order to use the saved funds to improve the salaries of current employees, allowing them to meet their basic needs and thereby maintain work efficiency. This is an unavoidable measure under the current circumstances, where various institutions, organizations, and industries are struggling to support their own operations but are unable to increase expenditures. Regarding the issue of assisting those who are unemployed after being laid off, we have already briefly presented our views in the editorial on February 27th. Now, we would like to offer some suggestions on the implementation of layoffs and salary increases, which may serve as a reference for all parties.

First, the current trend of layoffs should not be used by some people, especially business owners, as an excuse to dismiss their service personnel. Some bosses and managers, after enriching themselves, may have been lamenting the lack of an opportunity to kick out their long-term partners who have shared their hardships. They are now taking advantage of the situation, believing that they will no longer be subject to social and moral sanctions. This really needs to be corrected. We believe that companies and merchants that still have considerable financial resources or are not particularly exhausted should not follow suit with layoffs or lay off too many people. When arbitrating layoff disputes, the government should first investigate the actual strength of each institution in order to be fair, and those who abuse layoffs by taking advantage of the situation should be corrected.

Second, after deciding on layoffs, the authorities, especially government agencies, must be impartial and selfless in their selection process and must not rely solely on the personal likes, dislikes, and relationships of supervisors and the influence of introducers as the standard. The first to be laid off should be those who do not come to work but receive full pay, and those who only sit at their desks and have nothing to do. The second should be those who have jobs but are part-time and cannot concentrate on their work, and those with lower abilities. As for those who are diligent in their duties and have strong abilities, they must be retained as much as possible. Although this is an old saying, it is something that the authorities should pay close attention to again and again.

Third, those who are laid off must be given appropriate severance pay, and additional compensation should be added based on their daily performance or length of service. Additional compensation can be determined by each unit, but we believe that the most reasonable severance pay should include salary and various allowances, or it would be even better to provide various conveniences for returning to their hometown. As for the issue of raising the salaries of retained employees, we believe that not only should all the original salaries saved from those who were laid off be added to the salaries of those who remain, but also all kinds of expenses saved due to the reduction in personnel should be used for salary increases as much as possible. In addition, if the economic situation permits, it is also necessary to increase some expenditures due to salary increases.

Second, those who are laid off should take the opportunity to plan to return to their hometown. The tightening of various industries in Shanghai is already a very common and inevitable phenomenon. There are only layoffs and no additions, so it is very difficult for those who are laid off to find work in Shanghai. Rather than sitting and eating away at their savings, it is better to disperse early and not stay in Shanghai. At the same time, those with wives, children, and families must leave Shanghai as a whole and make plans early.

We hope that all parties will consider the above points carefully before implementing layoffs and pay special attention when implementing layoffs and salary increases.

### Record of an Inspection Along the Nanjing-Shanghai Railway Line, Part One: Inquiring at the Kunshan County Government, County Magistrate Yang Replied to Questions on Security and Other Matters

– Yi Tang

The biggest problem with the government's current administration lies in the frequent transfers of personnel. Often, a good plan is completely halted and changed due to personnel changes. During this time of war, the local government of a county faces a complex environment with too many agencies to obey, too many things to deal with, limited government funds, and insufficient manpower. In the midst of being busy and overwhelmed, it is truly difficult to build anything beneficial to the people.

The Kunshan County Government is better than some of the neighboring counties in terms of personnel. County Magistrate Yang Yongqing has been in office for more than two years, and most of his staff members are from the area, making it easy to get things done. If it were not for the special circumstances of wartime, I believe that County Magistrate Yang would definitely be able to achieve more than he does today.

County Magistrate's Answers. On March 6th, the second day after the reporter arrived in Kunshan, I went to visit the county government. County Magistrate Yang received me and answered the following questions one by one.

(Question) In the midst of the evacuation of people from Shanghai, what are your insights, County Magistrate? What are the difficulties in renting houses in Kunshan? Can temples and public property be lent to schools and charities moving from Shanghai?

(Answer) I feel that the evacuation of people from Shanghai is very necessary, especially because of the lack of supplies in Shanghai, so I am very sympathetic. However, there are limited vacant houses in Kunshan, and I am afraid that it cannot accommodate the majority of immigrants. As far as I know, Kunshan's position is also quite important, and all the temples and public property and some of the better civilian houses have recently been requisitioned. Therefore, it is actually difficult to provide housing for charitable organizations from Shanghai.

(Question) What is the state of public order in the county seat and the surrounding countryside? What is the progress of rice procurement?

(Answer) Kunshan was relatively stable in the past, but recently, due to the arrival of many "New Fourth Army" and "Loyal Salvation Army" troops, public order has deteriorated slightly. The city is of course still very peaceful, but it is hard to say in the countryside. Regarding rice procurement, the results are not very good because this county had a famine year last year.

(Question) What is the county's financial situation? What is the compensation for civil servants and security teams?

(Answer) The county's finances are in accordance with the methods promulgated by the provincial government, and there is nothing special about them. At present, the compensation for civil servants across the country is very meager (at this point, he smiled left and right), but the situation for the soldiers of the security team is much better, with each person receiving three dou of rice per month.

County Magistrate Yang just returned from a meeting in the countryside last night and is waiting to go to another place today, so the conversation ended here. I was introduced to Zhou Shizhang, one of the persons in charge of the Baojia office, who answered questions about the distribution, numbers, and occupations of the county's population as follows:

Population and Able-Bodied Men. Kunshan has jurisdiction over eleven districts, fifty-three townships, twenty-five towns, five hundred and sixty-four bao, six thousand one hundred and twenty-three jia, sixty-seven thousand five hundred and forty-two households, and three hundred and nine thousand eight hundred and forty-eight people. – This is the most recent statistic from February.

It is worth noting that in the total population of just under 310,000, males account for 159,119 and females account for 150,729. There are 9,000 fewer women than men, which leads to an unequal distribution. There is one unmarried man for every sixteen people. As far as the reporter knows, there are occasional instances of buying and selling of women of marriageable age in the lower classes of Kunshan, with the price roughly equal to ten shi of rice or a cow. However, the price varies depending on the age, beauty, and ugliness. In Kunshan, due to local customs, the cost of a formal marriage is very high. Although it is said that families who buy wives have to spend a whole number, it is actually cheaper, which is a serious social problem.

The second point worth noting is that among the 310,000 people, the number of able-bodied men aged 21 to 45 is 54,005, accounting for slightly less than one-sixth of the total population and more than one-third of the male population, which shows that the proportion of people engaged in production in Kunshan is quite large. In fact, in the countryside, women, the elderly, and the weak also work in the fields, so the countryside should be very wealthy if it were not for the frequent taxes and unavoidable natural disasters.

Occupational Distribution. Judging from the occupational distribution of the county's population, the number of farmers is the largest, followed by merchants, then workers, and then laborers and boatmen. According to the survey in January of this year, the distribution is as follows:

Occupation Category Number of People

Farmers 186,824

Merchants 65,887

Workers 19,939

Laborers 19,114

Boatmen 10,495

Civil Servants 5,441

Freelancers 3,260

Monks and Nuns 498

(Note: Laborers generally refer to porters, rickshaw pullers, coolies, etc., who do not belong to factories and do not have a fixed work location.) From the above table, it can be seen that the agricultural population accounts for nearly two-thirds of the total, while workers, laborers, and boatmen (part of whom are fishermen) account for one-eighth of the total population. Non-productive merchants, civil servants, freelancers, and monks and nuns account for one-quarter of the total population.

Observing the statistics from the most recent three months, we can see the trend of population movement in the county. The total population of the county was 310,184 in December of last year, 311,458 in January of this year, and 309,848 in February of this year. The difference between the highest and lowest in March is only 1,610 people, which is a very small number. The population mobility is low, which is the difference between an agricultural society and an industrial society.

Culture and Other Matters. In the midst of such tight funding and such high costs of paper and other expenses, the Baojia office's statistical work can continue unabated, and its spirit is commendable. I hope that the county can continue to provide this newspaper with materials in the future for comparison with other counties and for reference by those who study social problems.

According to the statistics of the Baojia, the number of able-bodied men in the whole county who have studied for three years is only 25,066, accounting for one-twelfth of the total population. This ratio is naturally still high compared to remote provinces, but it is still very backward compared to cities. There are several primary schools in the county, and the fees are not high, only around two thousand yuan. There is only one middle school. Social education is extremely underdeveloped. The county-run library is the only institution that provides mental food to the county's residents, and the books are also very scarce. The local small newspaper has ordinary sales, while Shanghai newspapers are in short supply and cannot be purchased.

Due to the backwardness of culture, superstition and gambling are rampant. Villagers use prayers to cure diseases, and teahouses use gambling as their main business. All of this is a symbol of the lack of popular education. (Sent from Kunshan on March 6th)

### Hubei Governor Ye Peng Discusses Raising Funds for Disaster Relief

Nanjing, 8th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – The newly appointed Governor of Hubei Province, Ye Peng, has come to Shanghai to raise funds for disaster relief in Wuhan, which has suffered heavily from air raids. The funds that have already been raised are scheduled to be used when he takes office in the near future. When the reporter visited Mr. Ye, he was kind enough to give a brief talk: "After Wuhan suffered a serious air disaster, I was ordered to lead Hubei, so after receiving the order, I first came to Shanghai to raise disaster relief funds. Thanks to the enthusiastic support of my fellow villagers in Shanghai, it is estimated that five to six million yuan can be raised by the end of this month, and fundraising will continue for other disaster relief efforts. In addition, half of Wuhan has been reduced to rubble, and plans are underway to restore Hankou, as well as to seek restoration loans. As for how to govern, whatever is beneficial to the people will be promoted, and whatever is harmful to the people will be eliminated. Furthermore, if local security cannot be restored, there can be no politics to speak of, so the top priority must be to strive to suppress bandits and communists, pacify the locality, and allow the people to live and work in peace."

### Administrative Training Institute Students Pay Respects to Acting Chairman Chen and Receive Instructions

Nanjing, 8th (Central News Agency dispatch) - The Ordinary Administrative Personnel Training Institute of the Executive Yuan, with its academic training nearing completion and the distribution of students to various provinces and cities for practical training imminent, had its entire student body, led by Director Shen Jian'er Qiao, pay respects to Acting Chairman Chen at 10:00 AM on the 8th. They received a personal address, which stated approximately: The government is providing further training to qualified senior personnel in order to enrich the academic abilities of administrative personnel, improve administrative efficiency, rectify official conduct, and purify governance. Furthermore, after the students graduate, they will be employed to the best of their abilities to utilize their talents fully. It is hoped that all students will conduct in-depth research on the innovations in local administration, in order to live up to the government's expectations. The students were greatly encouraged upon hearing this.

### German Defense Successful, Recaptures Lauban, Soviet Army Begins General Offensive Towards Berlin

Berlin, 8th (Central News Agency dispatch) - Havas Agency reports: After extremely intense shelling, the Soviet army has begun a general offensive towards Berlin. The initial goal of the Soviet army is to occupy bases for future offensives and to break through the Küstrin fortress. In the past few days, the German army has achieved complete defensive victories on the Eastern Front. The city of Lauban has been recaptured by the German army.

Since the Soviet army launched a fierce attack on Kietz-Teerofen-Loumersdorf, the situation has remained unchanged, but the Soviet army has repeatedly attacked south of Botow, with no progress in their attack near Hietz. On the East Prussian front, the Soviet army launched a fierce attack from the Neuhöfer area, also without success. The fighting on the Neisse and Oder rivers is only of secondary importance.

### Mussolini Calls for Cooperation with German Army

Berlin, 8th (Central News Agency dispatch) - On the 6th, Premier Mussolini addressed the National Republican Guard of the Fascist Republic of Brescia in northern Italy, hoping for sincere and comprehensive cooperation with the German army. The speech stated approximately the following: We must not forget the common destiny and mission of Germany and Italy. The coup d'état of July 1943 was a conspiracy. If the Italian General Staff had been well-prepared, I would not be speaking in Brescia today, but in Cairo Square. We are determined to defend every city and every home. Your cooperation with the German army must be to the greatest extent possible. We stand together in life and death because this war is a struggle for Germany's survival. Therefore, the enemy cannot destroy it. The German military and people have united to bravely defend their homeland.

### German Foreign Minister Issues Statement

Lisbon, 8th (Central News Agency dispatch) - The New York Times on the 6th published an account by a Swedish journalist who returned from Berlin: German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop recently hosted a morning meal for diplomats from small countries and three Swedish journalists. He first stated that the German army would steadfastly defend the Rhine River line. He stated: If Germany is defeated, then we at least have the right to choose which country should defeat us and entrust Germany to that country. Although the current situation is extremely critical, there is no need for pessimism. The Allied air force is doing its utmost to destroy all buildings between the Rhine and Berlin, but this scorched-earth tactic is hindering the Allied advance.

### Chiang Kai-shek Will Not Attend San Francisco Conference

Lisbon, 7th (Central News Agency dispatch) - The Washington Star on the 5th published news that Chiang Kai-shek would attend the San Francisco Conference, but the Chinese embassy in Chongqing denied this, saying that there was no such fact about Chiang Kai-shek's attendance.

### Japanese Military Discipline is Strict, Do Not Lightly Believe Rumors, Statement by the Japanese Military Police Headquarters

Modern warfare can also be described as a war of ideology and strategy, and the Greater East Asia War is no exception. If victory cannot be achieved in the ideological war, the future of the war is difficult to predict. The Shanghai Japanese Military Police Headquarters stated that recently, the enemy has actively used strategic means, and some malicious elements have spread baseless rumors to confuse people. Therefore, a statement was issued yesterday, strongly emphasizing that the authorities are determined to crush such rumors. The statement of the Military Police Headquarters is recorded as follows:

Recently, many citizens have been misled by the enemy's false propaganda, fabricating rumors and slandering Japanese soldiers, which is deeply regrettable. In particular, rumors such as Japanese soldiers committing indecent acts against Chinese women or corresponding with them are rife. However, among Japanese soldiers, there is absolutely no one who engages in such behavior, because the Japanese military discipline has always been extremely strict. If anyone violates military or disciplinary rules, they will definitely be severely punished by military law, which is a well-known fact. However, the enemy, in an attempt to slander the Japanese army, often fabricates rumors to mislead the public, which is a consistent tactic of the enemy. After detailed investigation, it has been found that the spreading of rumors is completely baseless and purely fabricated by the enemy. In the future, if anyone is found to be used by the enemy's strategy and verbally spreads such rumors, they will be regarded as deliberately insulting the Japanese army and will be severely punished. It is also hoped that when citizens hear such rumors, they will immediately report the detailed facts to the Military Police.

### City Government Holds Commemoration Ceremony Today

Today is the National Government's War Participation Memorial Day. As a matter of routine, the city government will hold a commemoration ceremony at 10:00 AM in the conference room. In addition to the leadership of senior city government officials, the chiefs of various departments and directors will also attend.

### Today is Air Defense Day, Implement Air Defense Training, Hold Various Comprehensive Exercises

Today (9th) is the 15th Air Defense Day. As a matter of routine, the city's Air Defense Headquarters is expanding its publicity of the meaning of air defense and implementing various major air defense training exercises. The time and methods of the alert training have already been published in yesterday's newspapers. Other training details are recorded as follows:

Local Training: This local air defense general configuration training will be held within the jurisdictions of the Old Zha and New Cheng sub-bureaus, with Nanjing Road and Jing'an Temple Road as the boundary line, divided into north and south districts. It is scheduled that the north district will start from 10:00 AM and the south district will start from 4:00 PM, each conducting training within two hours with small areas (groups within air defense districts) below the Bao level as units, so that all families and all residents can implement training at the same time. The greatest goal of this local training is to promote the general public's will for air defense and conduct practical training.

After the air raid alert is issued at 10:00 AM, traffic control will be implemented throughout the city, and vehicles and pedestrians will be prohibited from passing. After about 20 minutes, traffic, except for vehicles, will be restored.

Shelter Training: Areas under the jurisdiction of various sub-bureaus that do not participate in the local general configuration should, when the air raid alert is issued at 4:00 PM, imagine a large enemy aircraft formation coming to bomb everywhere, and thoroughly implement shelter training throughout the city for one hour. Police and air defense instructors will explain the essentials of shelter to the public, and administrative restraint will be taken against those who maliciously refuse to cooperate.

Lights-Out: From the issuance of the training alert at 7:00 PM to the lifting of the alert at 8:45 PM, a total of one hour and forty-five minutes. At that time, the lights-out squads of each sub-reporting office should strictly report any violations of the lights-out regulations the next day for investigation and sealing.

Alert Transmission: Alert transmission training is very important, because in the future, when the situation is very bad, it may be difficult to sound the alert siren, and whether the method of alert transmission is appropriate is crucial to reducing disasters. Therefore, at the time of each alert issuance and cancellation, the announced time should be imagined as an actual alert, and each police sub-bureau should be the main body, organizing alert transmission squads and alert reception stations, etc., to examine records so that corrections can be made.

### Finance Bureau Collects Business Tax, Convenes Discussions with Various Industries, Explaining the Meaning of Tax Collection and Tax Rates

The Shanghai Special City Finance Bureau, in order to collect the Business Tax for the spring of this year (34th year) in the former No. 1 and No. 8 districts, specially convened representatives of various industry guilds at the City Chamber of Commerce auditorium at 3:00 PM yesterday (8th) to hold a discussion meeting. Representatives from over 240 units, including the cotton cloth industry, silk industry, banking industry, money shop industry, Chinese medicine industry, cigarette industry, tea and food industry, grain industry, flour industry, Chinese and foreign department store industry, coal briquette industry, and chemical industry guilds, attended.

Subsequently, Section Chief Tang of the Business Tax Section explained questions, and the meeting adjourned at around 6:00 PM. The details are recorded as follows:

Chief Secretary Xu Songping's Speech: Chief Secretary Xu said in his speech, roughly: Today, I am here representing Director Luo to discuss the Business Tax situation in Shanghai's No. 1 and No. 8 districts with representatives from various industries. Business Tax is one of the normal national taxes. In the past, due to the concession system, it was not possible to uniformly collect Business Tax. Now that the concessions have long been recovered and normal conditions have been restored, the Finance Bureau has also decided to start collecting it in the spring of this 34th year. The collection method will be based on the sales amount of the sales industry and the capital amount of the manufacturing industry. It is hoped that various industries will truthfully report according to the declaration procedures to avoid being punished for untruthful reporting upon review. As for the past malpractice of extortion, the Bureau has absolutely suppressed it since Secretary-General Luo took over. I hope that various industries and everyone will provide assistance from time to time and exchange opinions frequently.

Key Points for Declaring and Paying Taxes: Key points for various industries to declare and pay taxes: (1) Declaration forms will be collected and distributed by various industry guilds. (2) After members of various industry guilds receive the declaration forms, they must be submitted to the collection section of the Business Tax Section of the Bureau within five days for submission by the guild. (3) The person in charge of each industry guild should earnestly advise members to truthfully declare their sales amount and not to over-report or under-report, so as to avoid punishment. (4) The sales amount for the winter of the 33rd year, that is, the sales amount for October, November, and December, will be used as the standard. The spring Business Tax will be paid according to the prescribed tax rate based on the winter sales amount. (5) The tax rates for various industries will be notified separately by the Bureau in accordance with the provisions of the Business Tax Regulations after being reported. Tax rate tables are distributed for reference. (6) In order to facilitate the payment of taxes by merchants and citizens, the Bureau has divided the jurisdiction of the former No. 1 and No. 8 districts into six districts for collection. Various industries can pay taxes at the nearest collection office. (7) The taxation standard for the sales industry is based on the sales amount, and the taxation standard for the manufacturing industry is based on the capital amount.

### Construction Bureau Adjusts Vehicle Registration Procedures, Effective from the 12th of This Month

The city's Construction Bureau, due to its relocation to the Municipal Government Office, has re-adjusted vehicle registration procedures for each district, which were previously handled by district vehicle registration offices. To streamline future operations, the bureau has altered all city registration offices. Details are as follows:

Regarding Vehicle Inspection and License Issuance: (1) Private and commercial automobiles must henceforth be inspected, registered, and licensed centrally by the bureau. (Located at the former site of the First District Donation Office on Jiangxi Road, entrance via Hankou Road). (2) Private and commercial trucks, after approval and certification by the bureau, will be inspected and registered at the Jiangning Road Vehicle Registration Office, followed by the issuance of ribbon licenses. Magnetic license plates will then be obtained from the bureau. (3) The former Public Utilities Bureau's Madang Road Vehicle Registration Office is abolished. All private pedicabs and private rickshaws may be registered at the Jiangning Road, Changning Road, Gongping Road, Huxi, Nanshi, and Zhabei vehicle registration offices, based on the vehicle owner's residential address. Private rickshaws in the former city area will continue to follow the previous practice and register at their original registration office. (4) Commercial pedicabs, after registration approval by the bureau, will be inspected and licensed at both Jiangning Road and Changxing Road offices. The former First District, Zhabei, Hubbei, Huxi and other areas will now be under the jurisdiction of the Jiangning Road Registration Office. The former Eighth District, Nanshi, Xu Cao, and other areas will now be under the jurisdiction of the Changxing Road Registration Office. (5) Commercial rickshaws and other vehicles will continue to be inspected and licensed by their original registration offices. Regarding driver's license examinations and the issuance of motor vehicle driver's licenses, these will be handled by the bureau. Pedicab driver's licenses were previously applied for at the Public Utilities Bureau; those who have not yet received them will now be issued by the Changxing Road Registration Office. New applicants should follow procedures at the bureau's various district vehicle registration offices based on the driver's residential address. Rickshaw driver's licenses previously applied for at the Public Utilities Bureau but not yet received will all be issued by the Changxing Road Registration Office. New applicants should apply at the bureau's various district registration offices based on the driver's residential address. The above-mentioned vehicle registration procedures will commence on the 12th of this month. Citizens are requested to take note.

### Police Bureau Retires Personnel, Pays Retirement Benefits

In order to refresh police administration and adjust personnel, the Municipal Police Bureau has eliminated redundant staff. On February 23, a method for paying retirement benefits was announced to demonstrate consideration for retiring personnel. The method is as follows: (1) Those with service of one year or more, but less than three years, will receive two months of salary and allowances. (2) Those with service of less than five years will receive three months of salary and allowances. (3) Those with service of less than ten years will receive four months of salary and allowances. (4) Those with service of fifteen years or more will receive six months of salary and allowances. (5) The standard for issuing salary and allowances for retiring officers and police will be based on the salary and allowance amount in January 1945. Over two thousand dismissed personnel have been announced in batches starting on the first of the month, and each branch bureau, station, and team has been instructed to process applications for retiring officers and police according to the above method and issue payments accordingly. It has come to light that some branch bureau chiefs have not yet implemented this method, which is unreasonable. Therefore, the bureau has re-issued an order to immediately fill out forms in accordance with the promulgated method and apply to the accounting section for the actual payment in order to complete the procedures.

### Deadline for Capital Increase for Financial Institutions

The Ministry of Finance promulgated an Outline for Strengthening the Operations of Financial Institutions in Shanghai Special Municipality on December 10 of last year. Any financial institution in Shanghai whose average daily total deposits within three months after the implementation of the outline are less than (1) 30 million yuan for banks, (2) 15 million yuan for native banks, and (3) 20 million yuan for trust companies shall increase capital or merge within two months after the expiration of the three-month period of the outline implementation. Failure to do so will result in closure. As of January 21 of this year, the three-month period had expired, and approximately 70% or more of financial institutions had an average daily total deposit amount less than the prescribed amount. These financial institutions have been supervised by the Central Bank Gold Examination Office to handle capital increase procedures since January 21. It is estimated that the actual collection is 15 million yuan for banks, 8 million yuan for native banks, and 10 million yuan for trust companies. It is learned that the deadline for capital increase for various financial institutions will expire on the 21st of this month and will not be extended. If the prescribed capital amount has not been fully increased within these two weeks, the institution will be banned and closed. It is reported that up to recently, more than 240 financial institutions (including banks and native banks) have completed capital increase procedures, while 20 to 30 have not yet completed the capital increase procedures.

### North Station Police Branch Chief Announces Details of the Incident Where a Woman Was Beaten to Death by a Man Wearing a Black Hat

Regarding the case at the Shanghai Station of the China Central Railway Company, in which Jiang Shiyan, affiliated with the station, violently beat Xu Peiwen, a female staff member of the Railway Protection Section of the China Central Railway Police Department, resulting in her death, Director Liu of the North Station Branch, due to the public's lack of understanding of the details of this case, gave an open statement to the Central News Agency reporter yesterday (8th) regarding the incident, as follows:

Female Clerk of China Central Railway: This case occurred at approximately 7:00 AM on the 4th of this month. The victim's name was Xu Peiwen, female, from Wuxi, age 25, and was currently a female clerk in the Railway Protection Section of the China Central Railway Police Department. The perpetrator was Jiang Shiyan, a deputy squad leader of Group C affiliated with the station, from Yancheng, age 25. The victim's husband's name is Xu Sen, who was also an employee of China Central Railway a year ago, holding the position of draft handler. The incident occurred because, on the morning of the incident, the victim and her husband were returning to their hometown of Zhenjiang for some reason. When queuing to purchase tickets, they did not follow the order and were whipped by the perpetrator Jiang, resulting in a verbal dispute.

Kicked in Vital Abdominal Area: Subsequently, Jiang forcibly took the woman to the office affiliated with the station and illegally beat her, using his foot to kick Xu's abdomen and other vital areas. Later, Li Yixuan, the squad leader of the station, and Zhang Hongsheng (who had a friendly relationship with the deceased) arrived to mediate. After joint discussion, Xu's husband, Xu Sen, accompanied the injured woman to Zhang Hongsheng's home to rest. At that time, Xu Sen thought that his wife's injuries were not serious, so he did not report it to the police. However, after arriving at Zhang's home, the injured woman repeatedly cried out in pain in her chest and abdomen. It was then that Li Yixuan and Xu Sen took the injured woman to Shanghai Sanatorium Hospital at No. 171 Bazilu, Hongkou, for treatment. Dr. Chen of the hospital diagnosed the injuries as severe, with the left kidney split into two pieces and severe internal bleeding in the abdomen and back, posing a serious threat to her life. According to regulations, the Hongkou Branch was immediately notified.

Clues to the Perpetrator's Whereabouts: The branch informed the North Station Branch, which had jurisdiction over the area where the incident occurred, about four hours after the time of the incident. After receiving the notification, I immediately ordered detectives Gao Chengye and others to go to the North Station to arrest the perpetrator. However, the perpetrator had already fled and could not be found. Many suspects were arrested and brought to the bureau for investigation, and a strict order was issued to pursue the fugitive. Also, when Li Yixuan, the squad leader of the station, accompanied the injured woman to the hospital, he left the hospital for forty minutes after the doctor confirmed the severity of the injuries. He is suspected of instigating the perpetrator to flee. Therefore, this branch has arrested him for investigation and is collecting various evidence to detain him within a few days and file a lawsuit with the local prosecutor's office in accordance with the law. Regarding the principal offender, after the detectives in charge of the case made every effort to investigate, they have substantial clues and should be able to solve the case soon.

Furthermore, it has been found that the China Central Railway authorities have remained silent throughout the days since the incident occurred, which has caused deep regret from all sectors.
