### Britain, the United States, and Industrially Advanced Countries Are Willing to Invest and Help Our Reconstruction; Shou Jingwei Discusses After Returning to Chongqing

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 12th] Dr. Shou Jingwei, the employer representative of our country to this year's International Labour Conference, arrived in Chongqing by plane the other day. When he met with reporters on the 11th, he stated that capitalists in Britain, the United States, and other industrially advanced countries intend to invest in China to help China's industrialization and reconstruction. However, all countries hope that China will first achieve domestic unity, democracy, and stability, as China's industrialization is closely related to the world's employment problem. On the American side, there is now an organization called the China-US Industrial and Commercial Association, which is mainly managed by American business tycoons engaged in international trade. Its purpose is to promote cooperation between the industrial and commercial circles of China and the United States and strengthen their ties. The American side will send a business delegation to China in the spring to investigate China's current situation. American automobile king Henry Ford has recently cooperated with Ferguson to produce a small, flexible, and lightweight tractor that is very suitable for Chinese farmland. Furthermore, the United States used industrial films to train workers during the war, enabling ordinary workers to be trained as skilled workers in three weeks, whereas such training used to take three months or half a year. All of these can be learned from by our country. When I visited Britain, I met with Sir Stafford Cripps, Minister of the British Board of Trade. Cripps believed that China should do its best to promote cooperative enterprises, which are also being brewing in Britain. At this International Labour Conference, our country's representative was elected as a director, which can be regarded as clear evidence of various countries' concern for our country's industrial and commercial reconstruction. Our country should seize this good opportunity to engage in industrialization, apply scientific management methods, use European and American funds and technical assistance, and use film education to train skilled workers. The future of industrialization is always very optimistic.

### Future Education of the Japanese Crown Prince

[Reuters, London, 12th] Washington and Tokyo are discussing the issue of Emperor Hirohito's fourteen-year-old crown prince via confidential telegrams. Hirohito is willing to abdicate and cede the throne to his son. The United States intends to first have him receive an American-style education. The Japanese Crown Prince currently lives alone and studies at a noble school. After leaving school, he rarely meets other children, and he rarely sees even his parents. General MacArthur believes that if the Crown Prince can graduate from an American university, perhaps Harvard University, it would greatly help the hope of Japanese democracy. Even if Hirohito suddenly abdicates, it will not hinder his son from studying in the United States. Matters of governance may be handled by a regent. Keenan and General MacArthur are investigating the Japanese Emperor's war records. The Japanese Emperor may not need to be tried, but for the sake of his personal position, it would be best for him to abdicate voluntarily. The Japanese Emperor said that he felt morally responsible for the war and was therefore willing to abdicate.

Starting with Prince Nashimoto, people continued to surrender, arriving at the prison about every five minutes. By 10:30 AM, nine people had arrived, all carrying luggage and accompanied by representatives from the Central Liaison Office. Prince Nashimoto is a veteran of the Russo-Japanese War. The Japanese imperial court had requested MacArthur to exempt him from arrest due to his old age, but to no avail. Other prisoners who have already surrendered include former Combined Fleet Commander Toyoda; Kobayashi Seizo (formerly Commander of the Combined Fleet, once served as Governor-General of Taiwan, and served as Chairman of the Imperial Rule Assistance Association during the war); former Domei News Agency President Furuno; Mitsui industrialist Tsuda; Representative of the House of Representatives and member of the Imperial Rule Assistance Political Society Ida; and nationalistic educator Kikuchi.

Negotiations Underway for Overseas Chinese Returning to Burma

A foreign reporter asked whether reports that the British side refused to allow Overseas Chinese to return to their original residences in Burma were true, and what the status of Sino-British negotiations was. Vice Minister Liu replied that the Chinese government has been continuously negotiating with the British side for months regarding the return of Burmese Overseas Chinese stranded in mainland China to their original residences. The British side claimed that the transportation situation and food supply in Burma had not yet returned to their original state, so it prohibited all foreigners from entering, and there was no discrimination solely against Overseas Chinese. Currently, the Burmese returnees stranded in mainland China are experiencing extremely difficult lives. Our government is actively negotiating with the British side to allow them to return to Burma, as the return of Overseas Chinese will also benefit the economic prosperity of Burma.

Provincial-Level Institutions Under Government Jurisdiction

A foreign reporter asked how many provincial-level institutions are currently under the jurisdiction of the central government, and how the provinces and border areas in North China are divided. Councilor Zhang replied that China is currently divided into 34 provinces: Sichuan, Xikang, Yunnan, Guizhou, Guangxi, Guangdong, Hunan, Hubei, Jiangxi, Fujian, Zhejiang, Anhui, Jiangsu, Henan, Hebei, Shandong, Shanxi, Shaanxi, Gansu, Ningxia, Qinghai, Xinjiang, Suiyuan, Chahar, Rehe, Liaoning, Jilin, Heilongjiang, Andong, Liaobei, Songjiang, Hejiang, Nenjiang, and Xing'an; and 8 special municipalities: Nanjing, Chongqing, Shanghai, Beiping, Tianjin, Qingdao, Dalian, and Harbin. The Administrative Governor's Office (Taiwan) is also under the jurisdiction of the central government. Apart from the so-called border areas around Yan'an, there are no other border areas. Although there have been suggestions to reduce the size of provinces recently, until the government decides to adopt and implement them, the provincial boundaries of North China, Central China, and South China will remain as they were.

Methods of Generating Public Opinion Organs

A foreign reporter asked whether the Communist Party claimed that people in the border areas could freely elect representatives, and whether the election situation and the number of local public opinion organs established under the advocacy of the central government could be disclosed. Councilor Zhang replied that during the War of Resistance, in order to gather ideas and promote local autonomy, the government established provisional provincial and county councils. Generally speaking, the method of generating them was that the county government sought opinions from all French and local figures, drew up a list, and sent it to the province for approval. The provincial provisional council was generated by the provincial government drawing up a list and sending it to the central government for approval. Now the government has issued a general order to all provinces in the rear to establish formal county councils by the end of this year. Provinces with more than half of their counties establishing councils can establish provincial councils.

Establishment Deadline for Occupied Provinces

Provinces that were previously occupied should establish provisional county councils within one month of recovery, and formal councils within six months. When more than half of the counties have established formal councils, a provincial council should be established. Currently, Sichuan has 140 counties with formally elected councils, Yunnan has 55 counties, and Shaanxi has 43 counties. The provinces have more than 300 counties with formal councils, and the rest are expected to be established quickly. As for the generation of formal county councilors, they are elected freely by representatives of townships and vocational groups in a ratio of 70% and 30% respectively. Provincial councilors are elected by the county councils, one person per county, regardless of party affiliation. Provinces that have formally established provincial councils include Sichuan, Gansu, and Guizhou, according to reports.

Studying Exchange Rate Between Legal Tender and US Dollars

A foreign reporter asked whether the amount of legal tender issued could be announced. Councilor Zhang replied that the restoration work has not yet been completed, and the government does not intend to announce the issuance figures.

[United Press, Chongqing, 12th] A spokesman for the Executive Yuan declared that the financial authorities are "studying daily" regarding the new exchange rate between legal tender and US dollars.

### Truth About Nagasaki Bombing Under Atomic Bomb

[United Press, Nagasaki, 11th] Nagasaki was bombed by the second atomic bomb on August 9th this year. US Army Medical Officer Captain Horn arrived here on September 25th. It is said that at that time, everyone was still in shock and order had not been restored. Professors and third- and fourth-year students of Nagasaki Pharmaceutical University, except for four doctors, had completely died. The bomb exploded only a few hundred yards away from the school and hospital. None of the patients, nurses, doctors, and first- and second-year students in the hospital survived. It is estimated that no less than 60,000 to 80,000 people in the city were killed, of whom 30,000 to 40,000 were burned to death in ten seconds. The rest suffered from gamma rays penetrating the bone marrow, damaging their red blood cell tissue, or suffered severe burns to the gastrointestinal tract and could not digest food, eventually dying after six weeks. The radioactivity in the embers is now no longer harmful. If one stayed at the bombing site for twelve hours in the first three or four days after the bombing, it might still have an impact, but after that, the radioactivity dissipated rapidly. Although the record paper in the Nagasaki Hospital was turned to ashes by the heat from the bomb, and the windows and medicine bottles were melted, many of the medical equipment stored in the basement were still intact. Strangely, many mattresses and iron beds in the neighboring houses were also preserved. Nagasaki's water and electricity supply has now been restored, but the gas plant has been completely destroyed. The buried corpses have a heavy odor, so there are many flies.

### Kim Gu Talks to Reporters About the Chaos in South Korea

[United Press, Seoul, 11th] Kim Gu, Chairman of the Korean Provisional Government, told reporters today that he did not know when the United Nations and the US military government would recognize his provisional government as the legitimate government. He even stated that he had no idea whether his regime could be recognized at all. He said that although his group tends to be liberal and democratic, most of it is politically right-wing. When a reporter asked whether his own political ideology was right-wing or left-wing, he replied: "I don't know, let the people answer for me." The current situation in South Korea seems to be still chaotic. In addition to Kim Gu as one axis, the People's Republic of Korea is another axis, and the military government is caught between the two, with the annoyance of not knowing what to do.

### Editorial: The Convening of the Three-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference

The Three-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference will be convened in Moscow on the 15th of this month. US Secretary of State Byrnes has traveled to attend with his entourage, and the British delegation will also go to the Soviet Union. International attention is gradually shifting from Washington eastward. Since the Five-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference in London in September, there have been many hidden reefs in the international situation. The world is paying attention to these reefs, but it seems that an appropriate and sound way to overcome them has not yet been found. Therefore, the convening of the Three-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference may open up a kind of deadlock.

The convening of this Three-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference itself seems to be a product with inherent deficiencies. The Five-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference in London did not actually achieve much. This Three-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference, inheriting the legacy of the London Conference, coupled with the inherent deficiencies, may not be able to be given much expectation. In fact, this is not a problem. Foreign ministers, who are in charge of the implementation of the country's foreign policy, are able to meet each other more often and exchange views. Even if there are no results, it will definitely help promote international understanding, which is naturally gratifying. But at the same time, we cannot conceal our regret. The Potsdam Conference mainly ended a wartime system and created a new system. In the effort to fight Germany, the Soviet Union, Britain, and the United States did bear a great burden, but that does not mean that the three powers will dominate the entire world. The post-war world needs coordination, which is no longer a military issue during wartime. Therefore, after Germany surrendered, the Potsdam Conference was convened. The countries that attended that conference certainly had some new leaders, but each other's national policies did not change due to the change of leaders. It is a natural trend to move from the Potsdam Conference to the Five-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference in London. The Five-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference should have achieved something and should continue to be convened from time to time, but the Five-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference has evolved into the Three-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference, which itself seems to be a retrograde phenomenon! We cannot help but feel regret about this.

Furthermore, in terms of the agenda: Although the news from Moscow may not be accurate, it can be asserted that the relationship here is complex. If the Three-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference can discuss and reach even a slight conclusion, it can pave the way for further advancement in the future. If the agenda includes discussions on European and Far Eastern issues, the absence of representatives from China and France will undoubtedly affect the acquisition of conclusions. On the issue of how to control post-war Japan, China is the first country to resist Japanese aggression. Its soil is connected, it has suffered the most, and it knows the most. China has the right to demand, and China's opinions should be respected. But now the Foreign Ministers' Conference in Moscow does not see representatives from our country. Because of the absence of representatives from China and France, the agenda that the Moscow Three-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference can discuss will undoubtedly be subject to certain restrictions.

Secondly, it is said that this Three-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference will discuss the signing of treaties with defeated countries and the issue of peace conferences. Regardless of whether Byrnes proposes the suggestion to convene a peace conference earlier, we would like to reiterate our intention here first, which is: the indivisibility of world peace. China, the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union are the main pillars of this anti-aggression war. During the war, they fought side by side; in the reconstruction of world peace, their cooperation is also necessary. In addition, the Fourth Republic of France will also be one of the main pillars of world peace. The cooperation of France is also indispensable for the reconstruction of world peace. The five powers should cooperate closely in the reconstruction of the world order; but unfortunately, at the London Five-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference, there was a suggestion to refuse the participation of Chinese and French representatives in discussions on certain treaties, which led to a stalemate. Now, as the Three-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference is convened, we hope that this unreasonable situation of dividing territories can be corrected. After a full-scale war, what follows is full-scale peace, which should include the participation of China and France.

In addition, there are many other issues, such as the Iranian issue, the Balkan issue, and the issue of atomic energy control, which are enough to affect the stability of the future world order. The issue of atomic energy control should not actually become a problem. Historically, it is impossible to find an invention that can remain secret forever, and the secret of atomic energy seems difficult to escape this historical law. But now, when the international situation is not yet clear, this issue also needs to be considered. But these are just the outer appearances expressed by the problem, not the core of the problem. In a nutshell, we hope that there can be further cooperation among international countries. There should be no discrimination between great powers and other United Nations, and there should be even less discrimination between great powers and great powers.

Education and Sports

### Central Political School to be Subordinated to the National Government

Cadre School and Central Training Corps Will Be Merged

[Chongqing Dispatch from Dahua News Agency] The issue of the Central Political School's subordination was previously decided by the Central Standing Committee to be taken over by the government.

At the beginning of this month, it sailed from Shanghai to Fujian, and on the 9th, it loaded sugar and native paper from Fuzhou to Shanghai. The ship had about 40 crew members and 60 to 70 passengers.

The Municipal Public Works Bureau has been actively carrying out repairs to important installations such as bridge foundations, bridge decks, and railings for the past two months. Among them, the repair work on the four major bridges, including Waibaidu Bridge, Sichuan Road Bridge, Henan Road Bridge, and Zhejiang Road Bridge, has been completed more than 80%.

According to the wharf was badly damaged during the enemy and puppet period, and the underwater structure of the wharf was also damaged during the US Air Force's raid on Shanghai, so this project is even more difficult. Currently, a dam is being built to drain the water to a depth of six or seven feet, and then the bottom soil is dug out before the entire project can be completed. At present, the repair project of the wharf is being rushed day and night, and it is expected to be completed as scheduled by the end of the year.

Hu Puan, Chen Lengxue, Pan Gongzhan, and others were invited to accompany them, all of whom were old friends who had worked with Ye in running newspapers in Shanghai 20 years ago.

### Mei Lanfang Visited Behind the Scenes at the Majestic Theatre

— Amateur

Mr. Mei Lanfang's performance at the Majestic Theatre was the last day. Out of respect for his art, I braved the cold night for a visit.

His dressing room was in the last room on the second floor, very spacious and well furnished. There was a writing desk by the window, and makeup supplies and mirrors were placed on it. Three or four people were serving him to comb his hair and apply powder. He was wearing a black and white checkered morning gown, carefully putting on makeup, while greeting the people who filled the room. Whether he knew them or not, he nodded with a smile. Many ladies and gentlemen said: I didn't expect Mr. Mei to be so kind.

The dressing room was filled with smoke. Two-thirds of the people in the room were women, who watched Mr. Mei intently as he transformed a man into a woman, revealing endless interest and curiosity. Mr. Mei's daughter was also there. She was about fourteen or fifteen years old, as kind as her father, and said that she liked drama more than anything else.

Mr. Mei put on the lake-colored costume of "The Peony Pavilion," and I asked to take a picture. He readily agreed. An Allied soldier also joined the camera. We took three pictures in total, and many people watched quietly on both sides, as if they were admiring a scene of a play.

It was almost time for "The Peony Pavilion" to go on stage. Many people crowded Mr. Mei down, holding his mirror, makeup box, and costumes for him. A table and a chair were placed behind the curtain, and he sat there to carefully touch up his makeup again.

I talked to him casually here. He said that he would perform again after a short rest. And when the Beijing opera musicians came, he could sing Beijing opera. He said that he missed Beijing, but he was not prepared to go back. I asked what path Chinese drama should take in the future, whether it should be spoken drama or Beijing opera? He was unwilling to answer the question directly, saying that he had to think about it carefully.

Mr. Mei has a very strange habit. Before each performance, he must stand behind the curtain for three to five minutes with his mind concentrated. He said that otherwise he would make mistakes on stage.

There was a commotion backstage because three Allied soldiers were climbing in the cracks of the set to watch the play.

On the way home, I thought that Mr. Mei's attitude was too humble, almost like an actor who was just making his debut. From this humility, we can understand the reason for his fame. The success of any career is not accidental. I hope Mr. Mei cherishes his artistic life, and millions of viewers hope that he will leave us with valuable inspirations and models.

### Social Services - Improving Street Lights in Various Locations

— Yong Yu

Recently, there have been an increasing number of traffic accidents in the city. For the safety of all citizens, it is necessary to improve traffic management. In addition to the current regulations that Jiujiang Road and Hankou Road have been changed to one-way traffic, more traffic police should be dispatched to the busy and commercial roads to direct and maintain order. In addition, regulations such as limiting the speed of jeep military vehicles and prohibiting drunk driving should be implemented to avoid accidents. The street lights on various roads at night should be improved. For example, Nanjing Road and the Bund are important transportation routes, and with the current heavy traffic and crowded streetcars, the street lights at night should be improved and the lighting increased to ensure traffic safety. Furthermore, it is common to see street lights on the Bund and Sichuan Road, Zhongzheng Road and other places still on during the day, which is incomprehensible. It is hoped that street lights will not be turned on during the day, and that they will be turned on when it gets dark at night. At the same time, the street lights that are not bright enough on some roads should be improved. The citizens would be very fortunate!

### The Tragic Jews

— Shen Yikun

Although Hitler has been eliminated and the Nazis have completely collapsed, the tragedy of European Jews is far from over. Under the Nazi's systematic campaign of massacre and eradication, the small number of Jews who survived are now struggling with the pain of hunger and disease.

According to the investigation by the Allied War Crimes Commission, 5.7 million Jews disappeared in Europe under the Nazi persecution.

According to observations of the Associated Press reporters on the European continent, Hitler's anti-Jewish laws have been almost completely abolished since the end of the war. However, racial hatred still persists.

As governments announce measures to help Jews regain the health and livelihood deprived by Nazi persecution, the people of various countries also intermittently relax the violence taught by years of propaganda.

But reports of anti-Jewish movements have come from Linz in Austria, Krakow in Poland, and the Netherlands.

A synagogue was burned down, the windows of Jewish shops were broken, and harsh, terrifying anti-Jewish pamphlets were distributed.

In some countries—such as Poland, Hungary, and France—the occurrence of anti-Jewish incidents is a resurgence of the residual toxins of Nazism, coupled with the disappearance of tolerance over the years.

In other countries, such as Austria, anti-Jewish sentiment arises from the preferential treatment given to hungry, sick Jews by the American military.

In conquered Germany, a strange phenomenon is emerging.

Former Nazis are claiming friendship with Jews, even forming kinship with them, and the horror of concentration camps has disappeared.

Reports from every European capital all say that no Jew is in prison anymore, but the former concentration camp life is still visible everywhere. Millions of Jews across Europe still live in barracks and sleep in huts because they have no home, no job, no money or any property, and no family.

The most urgent problem for European Jews is physical recovery. For many Jews, this is already hopeless.

Tuberculosis, malnutrition, and a long list of ailments caused by slave labor and concentration camp life continue to threaten them, although the American military has saved many. The first group of Jews who returned to Budapest looked terrible, but after several months of Allied care, eating well, they have gradually recovered.

Economic recovery is even more difficult. Several countries have enacted laws and appointed officials to restore the Jewish property plundered by the Nazis.

In some cases, there seems to be some progress. The Nazis' clever methods of selling and reselling confiscated property make it almost impossible to clarify ownership.

Regarding creating a new life, almost every Jew in every country feels it is difficult to get started. They don't even have the remnants of their past property.

In Austria and Hungary, their chances of recovery are less than those who have been cruelly oppressed. In Belgium and France, they have gained equal footing.

The main hope for German and Eastern European Jews is to go to Palestine. But due to immigration laws and fierce resistance from Arabs, only a very few can currently achieve their goal.

Of all the Eastern European countries, Bulgaria seems to have the brightest situation. The number of Jews in the area is about 47,000, and they have almost maintained this number during the war. The intervention of prominent Bulgarian leaders prevented the Nazis from deporting large numbers of Jews. The anti-Jewish economic laws of wartime have been abolished, and Jews have gained full economic and political rights.

The Polish Jews are the most numerous in Europe, and the situation in Poland is also the darkest. Before the war, there were 3.5 million Jews in Poland. The number remaining now is 100,000 to 150,000. Jewish spokesmen say the Germans killed 3.2 million, and the rest fled to other countries. The small number of Jews remaining in Poland are leading the work of rebuilding Polish commerce on the ruins of the war.

There have been some anti-Jewish movements in Poland, but the Polish government is helping Jews to complete their economic recovery.

The situation of Austrian Jews is more difficult to determine, because there is a dispute over the number of Jews returning to Vienna. It is estimated to be about 3,000 to 10,000 people.

German Jews have the right to choose their original nationality or remain stateless. It is said that 90% of German Jews want to go to Palestine.

Inventions

### Helium Tires

— Yu Fan

The two giant rubber tires of the C-47 transport plane, filled with compressed air, weigh a total of 180 pounds. Now, someone has thought of using helium instead. Helium is four times lighter than air, so using helium would reduce the weight of the two tires by about 150 pounds, which is exactly the weight of one person. In other words, the transport plane can carry one more person. The capacity of one person is a small matter, but it is worth striving for. Foreigners are meticulous about everything and refuse to be careless, which is evident here.

Military Affairs

### Unprecedented Giant Cannon

— Mu Wu

A giant cannon of unprecedented size was recently discovered in the forests of Bavaria, Germany. The cannon barrel weighs 1,340 tons, has a bore of 31.5 inches, and fires shells weighing 8 tons (equivalent to the largest bombs used by the Allies in this war) to a range of 30 miles.

This giant cannon was manufactured by the Krupp factory and was originally intended to break the Maginot Line. Later, it demonstrated its great power during the siege of Sevastopol. Some believe that this monster also appeared in the English Channel artillery battle to bombard the coast of Dover. This is the largest cannon in the history of warfare, far surpassing the nine-inch long-range cannon that bombarded Paris in 1918.

Health

### Reduced Lung Disease Mortality Rate?

— Lao Shen

The number of deaths from tuberculosis in the United States in 1944 was 3,000 fewer than in 1943. The mortality rate in 1944 was an average of 40.8 people per 100,000, compared to 42.6 people the previous year. However, the American Tuberculosis Association warned the public that this statistic should not be viewed with optimism. According to common sense, tuberculosis is bound to be more rampant during wartime, but tuberculosis is a chronic disease, and the effects of war may not appear for several years. The American people are wealthy and have not suffered from famine or hardship during the war. In addition, the tuberculosis prevention movement is well-developed, and X-ray prevention checkups are widely implemented, so the reduction in mortality rate is not without reason. As for China, it has certainly increased over the past eight years. Fortunately, we don't have statistics. If we did, it would be terrifying. Resistance to tuberculosis depends on material conditions. If the situation of poverty and exhaustion of resources is not improved, even if a special medicine for lung disease is invented, it will be useless.

### The Enemy (17)

— Pearl S. Buck, translated by Zhu Qi

"I think so. You need to know. You are not just hiding here," Sadao said.

The young man nodded, fully understanding. He said simply, "Okay."

Sadao didn't see him again until the evening. As soon as it was dark, he dragged the sturdy little boat to the shore, filling it with food, a few bottles of water that he had secretly bought during the day, and two cotton blankets bought from the usual store. He tied the boat to a post in the water, as the tide was high. There was no moon that night, and he didn't even use a flashlight while he worked.

When he returned to the house, he looked as if he was returning from seeing a patient, so Hana knew nothing. As she served him dinner, she said, "Yumi came by today." Although she was very modern, she still did not eat with him. She sighed and said, "Yumi cried over the little boy. She really misses him."

"The servants will return when the foreigner is gone," Sadao said.

That night, before going to sleep, he went into the guest room. He carefully checked the American's temperature, the condition of his wound, his heartbeat, and his pulse. The pulse was irregular, but that was probably due to excitement. The young man's pale lips were tightly closed, and his eyes were fiery. Only the scar on his neck was red.

"I know you are saving my life again," he told Sadao.

"Don't thank me. I am doing this only because it would be very inconvenient for you to stay here," Sadao said.

He hesitated over whether to give the man a flashlight, but finally decided to give it to him. It was a small flashlight, his own, which he used when making house calls.

"If you run out of food before you get on the boat, shine the flashlight at me twice as the sun is just setting. Don't shine it in the dark, or someone will see you. If you are safe and still on the island, shine it at me once. It's easy to catch fish there, but you'll have to eat them raw. Lighting a fire will attract attention," he said.

The young man breathed out, "Okay."

He was now wearing the kimono that Sadao had given him, and finally, Sadao wrapped a cloth around his blond head.

"Good," Sadao said.

The young American did not say a word. He warmly shook Sadao's hand, then walked quite steadily out of the room, down the stone steps, and into the dark garden. Once—twice—Sadao saw him shine the flashlight to light the path. But this would not attract attention. He waited until the flashlight shone again at the shore, then he closed the doors and windows. He slept very well that night.

Commercial News

### Market Atmosphere Clears, Gold and Yarn Show Strength

Yesterday's market was quite firm. Although there was a slight wavering in the middle, the market rallied strongly due to short covering. The struggle between bulls and bears was fierce. Large traders took a cautious approach, waiting for the re-establishment of exchange rates. The market atmosphere has turned from gloomy to clear, and the trend seems to be gradually improving. The market opened flat in the morning, but short sellers tried to salvage the situation, and the reported declines in the capital also caused a drop to 6.46 million. Strong players kept buying. Once support was established, northern buyers came in to cover their shorts, and the situation changed afterward. The market gradually forced a short squeeze. Buying sentiment was strong, and the price broke through the 7 million mark. Banks slightly sold off at higher levels, and the market then hovered around 6.8 million. As a result, the market closed 15,000 higher than the previous close. Gold jewelry was priced at 74,000, silver at 600 yuan, and silver dollars declined slightly to around 420 yuan. Underground lending rates improved with the market and increasing demand, generally ranging from 10% to 12%.

Foreign Currency: The US dollar followed the gold market's ups and downs. It initially fell from 1,080 yuan to below 1,050 yuan, but later, due to the gold market's short squeeze, it was bought up. The gloom of the past few days has been cleared, and the dollar gradually rose to 1,120 yuan, finally hovering around 1,090 yuan. As a result, it closed 20 yuan higher than the previous close. Old Hong Kong dollars did not show any significant gains or losses, while new dollars fluctuated slightly due to competition between buyers and sellers, but the final result was still one yuan higher than the previous close.

Securities: Public bonds initially saw profit-taking from bulls. Type C bonds fell from 550 yuan in the morning to 490 yuan. Outside investors continued to be active, and the recovery of the gold market boosted the bullish momentum. The market rebounded to above 560 yuan, and there was a slight pullback at the end, but the result was still 30 yuan higher than the previous close. Types A, B, D, and E were less affected due to time constraints and underperformed slightly. The sentiment in Chinese stocks continued to follow the gold market. The market showed signs of weakness in the middle, averaging a decline of about 10% from the previous close. After struggling for a long time, it began to recover when the gold market turned bullish. However, the results varied compared to the previous close. Yongsha rose while Meiya fell, and the three small hot stocks each fell by more than one yuan. Foreign stocks were also uncertain, with gains and losses varying. The final results were slightly up or down compared to the previous day.

Rice and Grain: The rice market was firm in the morning but weak in the afternoon, unable to rise. Prices were similar to the previous day. Middle and secondary grade indica rice and Duzi indica rice showed slight strength. Although oil market owners were firm, demand was normal, with slight increases ranging from several hundred to nearly one thousand yuan. The flour market was strong due to speculation about the origin of the products, and prices rebounded by 100 to 200 yuan. Soybean costs increased across the board, and retail sales were active, stabilizing the market and adding 200 to 300 yuan. Soybean cake also rebounded by 100 yuan.

Yarn Market: Continued gains were seen, and customer sales were also quite active. In addition, gold prices continued to rise, further strengthening market sentiment. 20-count combed yarn rose by about 20,000 to 30,000 yuan compared to yesterday, and sales of 16-count yarn were also very active, resulting in an increase of about 10,000 yuan compared to yesterday. Fine yarn and double-ply yarn were especially favored by Hubei and Hunan traders, rising by about 30,000 to 40,000 yuan. Recently, the yarn market seems to fluctuate with gold prices. Before the resumption of shipping between the north and south oceans, large-scale exports are difficult to achieve in a short time, which is a major problem for the development of the yarn market.

Knitted Goods: Yesterday, knitted goods dealers were eager to sell, but there were few buyers. Morning prices were similar to the previous day. In the afternoon, some people suddenly went out to buy, mainly because gold prices had risen. Generally hot-selling goods began to increase in price again. For example, Yanshou socks traded at 2,450 in the morning, but suddenly demanded 2,700 in the afternoon. Three-orange socks were asked for 3,200, but no sales were made. It is generally speculated that today's market prices will still depend on gold prices.

Cigarettes: Yesterday's cigarette market saw gold prices rise and had been falling for many days, market sentiment turned bullish, and people were buying on dips, causing the market to flourish. British American Tobacco rebounded to 6,000 yuan in the afternoon, and Old Knife and Fairy also showed strength.
