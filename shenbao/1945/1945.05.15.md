### Intense Battle on the Intricate Lines of Okinawa Island; Japanese Water Special Attack Force Fiercely Attacks Enemy Convoy

Tokyo, 14th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - The Japanese army on the Okinawa front is engaged in increasingly fierce battles with powerful enemy forces pressing towards Naha and the north of Shuri. From the morning of the 13th, the enemy launched intense attacks on the areas of Kyozuka, Zaha, and the Ameku district north of Naha. The Japanese army immediately fought bravely in response, with both sides reinforcing their forces, and engaged in bloody battles for control on the intricate front lines. The enemy force facing Kyozuka and Zaha consists of approximately 1,500 infantry with tanks. In the southwest area of Koji, from the morning of the 13th, powerful enemy units attacked Nishihara Village and Height 150. The Japanese army bravely engaged them, especially the Japanese troops northeast of Ishimine, who obstructed the enemy's advance. In the area east of Kobazu, the enemy is gradually closing in on the Japanese positions. Simultaneously, the Japanese Water Special Attack Force, in coordination with the fierce battles of the ground forces, bravely launched an attack on the enemy convoy off Kadena on the night of the 12th, setting fire to an enemy ship of unknown type off the coast of Gusukube. At dawn on the 13th, Japanese ground forces observed two pillars of fire off Kadena, which is believed to be a glorious result of the Japanese Special Attack Force.

Nansei Islands Base, 14th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - Following the 13th, the Japanese air force launched fierce attacks on enemy units on Okinawa Island on the 14th. The fires near Kitatama are still not extinguished. Furthermore, only six enemy planes intruded on the entire line of the Ryukyu Islands on the morning of the 13th.

Southern Frontline Base, 14th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - The enemy forces in the southern region of Okinawa Island, after launching their offensive on the 9th, have been engaged in intense fighting for five days, concentrating all the landing force strength since the start of the Okinawa operation, which is a point worth noting. The enemy's 96th Division and 27th Division of the 24th Army Corps, having been heavily attacked by the Japanese army, have been almost completely annihilated. The enemy has therefore transferred the 77th Division from the Kerama area and the 1st Marine Division from the Kadena area to the front lines, combining them with the previously deployed 7th Division to fill the gaps. Recently, the enemy's 6th Marine Division, which landed in the Nago area, has joined the battle on the right front. The enemy has deployed four divisions along the front line, which is less than ten kilometers from east to west, adopting a total attack posture, attempting to decide the outcome. Although the Japanese garrison forces have been slightly infiltrated by the enemy in various locations, the Japanese army is employing traditional ambush tactics, launching desperate attacks everywhere, completely shattering the enemy's plans. The offensive and defensive battles that the two armies have been engaged in for several days appear, from a general observation, to be determining the victory or defeat of the Okinawa operation. On the morning of the 12th, the enemy repeatedly attacked the right flank of the Japanese army on the current front line. The soldiers on the front line fiercely counterattacked, securing key defensive positions. The enemy's attacks on the front were most intense. The highlands north of Zaha have also seen repeated fierce battles since the 12th. Furthermore, the enemy, with 50 tanks accompanying the troops, advanced north of Naha. By the evening of the 12th, the two armies were engaged in fierce fighting on the battle line connecting Zaha and Makabi. The Japanese army's fierce attacks have achieved great results.

### 17 Enemy Planes Attacking Nagoya Shot Down; Japanese Air Defense Units Achieve Victory

Tokyo, 14th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced at 4:00 PM on the 14th: Approximately 400 B-29 type planes from a southern base attacked the Nagoya area from around 7:00 AM on the 14th for about an hour and a half, dropping incendiary bombs on the city area and conducting indiscriminate bombing. Fires broke out in various parts of Nagoya City, but were extinguished by around 12:00 PM. The results of the Japanese air defense unit's interception are currently under investigation. So far, it has been confirmed that eight planes have been shot down and nine planes have been destroyed.

Keijo (Seoul), 14th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - The Korean Military District Headquarters announced at 4:00 PM on the 13th as follows: Nine enemy flying boats attacked the South Korean coast between 9:20 AM and 3:00 PM on the 13th, with one or several planes at a time. Some of them launched attacks, causing minor damage to the Japanese side.

### Over a Thousand Enemy Planes Continue to Attack Yesterday

Tokyo, 14th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - An enemy mobile force appeared southeast of Kyushu on the 13th, and 800 carrier-based planes attacked Japanese air bases. As of the 14th, it still occupied the ocean in that area, and launched another 1,000+ planes to attack since morning. The Japanese air force intercepted them in various locations, continuing the fierce battle. At the same time, the Japanese Kamikaze Special Attack Force also launched fierce attacks on the enemy mobile force on the morning of the 10th.

Fukuoka, 14th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - The enemy mobile force that appeared approximately 250 kilometers southeast of Tanegashima at dawn on the 13th used carrier-based planes such as the Grumman F6F and the Vought F4U Corsair to carry out wave-like attacks on Kyushu. The first formation, approximately 80 planes, intruded from Shibushi Bay, near Miyakonojo and Enokoku, into Kagoshima, Miyazaki, and Oita prefectures around 5:30 AM, and retreated from the Satsuma Peninsula and northern Miyazaki Prefecture by 6:30 AM. The second formation, approximately 150 planes, intruded from Shibushi Bay and the Satsuma Peninsula near Miyazaki around 6:30 AM, into the same area of operation as the first formation, and retreated around 7:30 AM. The third formation consisted of approximately 150 planes from around 7:30 AM to 8:30 AM. The fourth formation, approximately 20 planes, intruded from the Bungo Channel, northern Miyazaki, and Shibushi around 8:30 AM. The fifth formation, approximately 70 planes, intruded from the Osumi and Satsuma Peninsulas and the east of Miyazaki Prefecture around 9:30 AM, and generally retreated in the same direction. Furthermore, one B-29 type plane intruded into the vicinity of Saiki from the Bungo Channel, and then headed east from Tanegashima. The sixth formation, approximately 120 planes, intruded from the sea south of Miyazaki from 11:20 AM to around 12:10 PM, and retreated after passing through southern Miyazaki and southern Kagoshima Prefecture. The seventh formation, approximately 90 planes, passed through southern Oita Prefecture, northern Miyazaki, and then northern Kumamoto Prefecture between 12:30 PM and 2:00 PM in the afternoon and retreated. The eighth formation consisted of 50 planes, the ninth formation 105 planes, and the tenth formation 30 planes, totaling 900 planes before and after.

Tokyo, 14th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - The large-scale enemy air raid on Kyushu at dawn on the 13th was the first since March 18th, three months before the start of the Okinawa operation. The purpose of the enemy air raid was to suppress Japanese air bases in the Kyushu region, in order to open up a favorable decisive battle on Okinawa.

### Japanese Interception Units Fiercely Attack American Ships

Nansei Islands Base, 14th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - The enemy mobile force dispatched carrier-based planes on the 13th to attack various air bases in Kyushu. On the 14th, an enemy mobile force consisting of two or three large and small aircraft carriers each and two battleships intruded into the southeast sea area of Kyushu. On the morning of the 14th, the aircraft carriers retaliated by attacking various locations in Kyushu, China, and Shikoku. The Japanese interception units launched an attack on the enemy aircraft carriers and battleships at sea.

Lisbon, 14th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - A dispatch from the Omijima Base states that Admiral Nimitz's headquarters issued a special communique on the 13th, stating: American fleets were attacked by Japanese planes near Okinawa Island on the 10th and 11th, resulting in damage to one large warship and several ships.

### Military Commentator Observes: Eastern Asia's Terrain is Different; Japan Can Definitely Win

Central News Agency Report - The recent situation on Okinawa Island has become more intense and strained. The reason for this is that the American enemy has suffered severe damage around Okinawa Island and made no progress, so they are urgently seeking a way out and attempting to take action. According to observations by military commentators in this city, this is precisely the long suit of Japan, which is to defeat the enemy's forces individually. The European aspect of what is so-called the United Nations victory route, from the perspective of the situation, is nothing more than the consumption of vast amounts of material. There is no strategy or tactics to speak of. If Britain and the United States also use this method to fight in the East Asian region, then, due to the relationship of terrain, Japan can definitely win. At the same time, US President Truman's policy towards Japan is different from that of the late President Roosevelt. Moreover, due to the long duration of the European war, many American troops are exhausted and avoid fighting, especially due to problems with transportation subsidies and the economy, the American enemy faces great difficulties and will definitely not be able to cope with a long-term war.

### Enemy Forces on Okinawa Making No Progress

The ground battles on Okinawa Island, in the area north of Naha and north of Shuri, and in the area between Shuri and Yonabaru, are still in a state of confrontation. Initially, the enemy used four divisions to engage in combat, but made no progress. Recently, the 16th and 2nd divisions in the north were transferred there in an attempt to reinforce and salvage the dangerous situation, but this was still a pipe dream, and the sacrifices were even greater. Furthermore, due to the fierce annihilation by the Japanese Special Attack Force, they suffered serious blows, so the American enemy became unusually anxious and, in order to take action against the bases of the Japanese Special Attack Force and attempt to make plans, they carried out this maneuver of dispatching a mobile force.

### Enemy Mobile Force's Strength is Weak

However, after investigating, the strength of the mobile force is weak. It is based only on about five or six aircraft carriers. Under the current circumstances of Britain and the United States, the composition of this mobile force has already created their greatest military force. At the same time, the enemy is urgently seeking another way out, even trying to take a peek at the Kyushu area. Now, on the Japanese side, this kind of attempt by the enemy is truly a good opportunity for individual defeat. What will happen in the future can be judged based on the situation in the last few days. In short, the losses of enemy warships are heavy. According to what Imperial Headquarters has announced, the losses of enemy warships around Okinawa have reached more than 500. The enemy side is unwilling to announce its own losses, but now it has already revealed some of them. Therefore, at this tense moment in the battle, the enemy's announcement shows that the damage is severe and can no longer be concealed. According to what the enemy announced, as of the 11th of this month, the number of battle deaths was 2,684 and the number of wounded was 14,000, but according to the results of the Japanese investigation, the number of enemy soldiers killed and wounded was 36,000.

### European War is a Struggle for Materials

As for the enemy's various propaganda after the end of the European war, the direction of the flow is roughly as follows: The enemy's victory in the European war was due to, first, according to Marshal Zhukov's interview with a Reuters reporter, the reasons for the United Nations' victory: the United Nations' large-scale bombing, the low-altitude attacks of the combat aircraft, the thorough bombing of the German people, and the fact that they lacked gasoline and other fuel. Germany's V-1 and V-2 new type of guided missile did not exert the effectiveness expected from them. Second, in other enemy propaganda, the main ones are massive numbers of aircraft and powerful tanks, airborne troops, large-scale airlift capacity, and ingenious large-scale operations. According to the personal observation of this military expert, the main aspect of the European war was a struggle over the quantity of materials; there were really no strategies or tactics to speak of. On the battlefront, the enemy used large numbers of troops, aircraft, and tanks to advance greatly in order to decide the victory. Third, according to Marshal Zhukov again, the reasons for Germany's failure this time were the enemy's bombing of the German people, especially the acts of killing German civilians.

### Eastern Asia and Europe Have Different Terrains

In addition, there is another type of propaganda that claims that Britain and the United States will transfer European forces to the Greater East Asia battle line, but this is not impossible after a considerable period of time. However, we know that the terrain of East Asia is different from that of Europe, and there are many sea areas. The enemy must have corresponding bases and supplies of fuel and weapons in order to operate with its air force, so large numbers of aircraft alone are not applicable. On the one hand, the enemy has suffered serious blows on Okinawa Island, so we deeply believe that Japan definitely has the confidence to win.

Also, the current situation of the German fleet, according to what the enemy has announced, the remaining strength of the German fleet is two cruisers, thirteen destroyers, three hundred submarines, 160,000 tons of merchant ships, and high-speed torpedo boats. Among them, only two cruisers surrendered. For other operations, the enemy has been doing everything it can to advise the remaining fleet to surrender via radio. The majority of German submarines are still continuing operations in the North Sea, north, southwest of the British Isles, and the English Channel, so the enemy's transport is deeply in trouble. Although it is said that a part of the submarines can go to East Asia, it is difficult to realize due to various fuel-related reasons.

### Cooperation Between Britain, America, and the Soviet Union is Difficult

The Polish question, Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union are still insisting on not giving in, so there will be developments in the future. According to a San Francisco broadcast on the 12th of this month, according to a Washington dispatch, Stalin has refused Truman and Churchill's request for a compromise. Also, according to a Washington dispatch on the 12th of this month: US Under Secretary of State Grew said when meeting with reporters: Marshal Stalin has notified that the Soviet Union has no spare energy to cooperate with the Western Allied countries. However, there is no definite record of this kind in news reports, so behind these types of statements, there must be considerable problems.

### Truman Understands the Japanese Nation

Recently, the main concentration of American B-29 type planes has been in the Mariana Islands. Their attack focus, at present, is to conduct harassment operations against the Japanese mainland, and they have very few other missions. Furthermore, when the late American President Roosevelt was alive, he adopted a strategy of "eliminating Japan." The purpose of the current President Truman is that, because he understands the Japanese nation, he has reversed the past policy. In particular, the end of the European war, which lasted five years, is quite difficult for the Greater East Asia War. In addition, it is definitely difficult to win a long-term war due to transportation subsidies and the economy, and Japan will definitely not fall for his strategy. Moreover, the San Francisco conference is fraught with hidden dangers. The Soviet representative Molotov, the British representative Eden, and the Chongqing representative Song Ziwen were all absent from the conference, and Song Ziwen received cold treatment from the United States. In short, the absence of these representatives may bring about major changes in future world politics.

Editorial

### Storing Food and Conserving Water

Recently, due to the changes in the international war situation, some citizens of Shanghai have not been without optimistic fantasies, perhaps thinking that Shanghai will not be affected by the war. This kind of unrealistic, unwarranted thought is enough to relax vigilance regarding wartime, and the result is very dangerous for oneself. In terms of the entire war situation, although the European war has ended, the East Asian war situation has long lost its connection with the European war and will not ease due to the end of the European war, but will become more tense. We certainly don't need to speculate wildly on which aspects of the war will advance in the future, but as Shanghai citizens living in an important wartime city, only by raising our awareness of the war and making various necessary preparations can we benefit both the war situation and ourselves, and thereby reduce the pain and damage that may be encountered.

Therefore, what Shanghai citizens should pay attention to today is to recognize the reality of the war situation and prepare for contingencies. If one only indulges in optimistic fantasies, the result will be that when the unexpected occurs, one will not only find one's fantasies shattered, but one will also panic and suffer damage in vain. Therefore, rather than being optimistic and fantasizing, it is better to be prepared for any eventuality.

We believe that the most important things to prepare for at present are storing food and conserving water, and we will elaborate on our views below:

A tense war situation, or frequent air raids, can both lead to traffic congestion. When the whole city enters a state of alert, the biggest problem will be food. Shanghai's food has always relied entirely on the surrounding countryside. Once traffic is blocked and the food supply is cut off, it will be necessary to rely on existing reserves. It is necessary to have a reserve of two months' worth of consumption to guard against emergencies. Assuming that a bao or a jia is taken as a unit, the total number of people within this jia or this bao should be counted, and the amount of food that should be stored should be set. The food that should be stored should be concentrated in one place or placed in two or three places. The storage location should be a vacant house within the jia or bao that is borrowed. This storage should be public for all households in the jia or bao, and all households in that bao jia have a duty to protect it. The types of food are not limited to rice, and most can be used to supplement grains.

As for purchasing and sharing the expenses, it is best for the municipal government to preside over it and use the baojia organization to promote it from top to bottom. First, the municipal government should organize a purchasing committee to be responsible for purchasing. Another allocation committee should be formed, with the heads of each general joint bao serving as members. Under them, each joint bao should set up a branch, organized by the joint bao head and bao heads. In principle, the price of food should be divided equally according to the number of people in each household, but in the case of some poor families who are truly unable to bear the burden, the richer ones within the same unit should provide a small amount of assistance, and the municipal government should raise additional funds to make up for the difference.

Tap water is very prone to damage during wars and air raids, resulting in water outages. The only remedy for this is to widely install artesian wells. In the past, various baojia districts in this city have already promoted well digging, but there was no overall plan. The allocation of land and the standards for digging techniques and styles were not consistent, causing discussions in various quarters. We propose that the baojia authorities should take charge, formulate an overall plan, and use the baojia organization to promote the well-digging movement. A certain number of households should dig a well on one side, and the digging techniques and methods should also be standardized and practical. Those who contract to dig wells must be approved by the Construction Bureau, and the completion of the project must also be inspected and accepted by the technical personnel of the Construction Bureau to show responsibility.

Tokyo, 14th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - Prime Minister Suzuki said on the 14th at the meeting of local officials that there has been "no change in Japan's operations" after Germany's surrender, and he requested that local officials specifically manifest Japan's war will based on the unwavering belief of self-preservation and self-defense. He also hoped that local officials would work together with the people, which is "the essence of administration." Prime Minister Suzuki also said that he had read The Comprehensive Mirror in Aid of Governance as a child and saw the sentence by the Yuan Dynasty's famous chancellor Yelü Chucai, "Benefiting one thing is not as good as eliminating one harm." At the time, he did not understand what it meant, but today, it can truly be regarded as golden words. "The rapid organization of the National Volunteer Corps is a national organization that uses the people's patriotic zeal as its driving force, and is a practical movement. Under the guidance of the military authorities, it will form a fighting posture for defending the homeland. However, our people should still each guard their posts and fully display their devotion to public service. This is what we should pay attention to. I hope that local officials will overcome any difficulties, resolutely complete their war responsibilities, and move towards the path of completing the war."

Regarding the base issue, a clear state of opposition already exists between the Soviet Union, Chongqing, and the United Kingdom, the United States, and France. The main content of Chongqing's proposal is as follows: Divide non-independent territories into two types: strategic areas and non-strategic areas. Strategic areas are managed by the Security Council, and non-strategic areas are managed by the General Assembly. The U.S. proposal once requested that the authorities managing strategic areas submit reports according to the reporting format stipulated by the Trusteeship Council, while Chongqing's proposal requires the authorities managing security-protected areas to submit reports to the Security Council according to the reporting format stipulated by the Security Council. The scope of managed areas stipulated to ensure world security should be limited to the minimum area necessary for defense or security.

### Cooperative Enterprise Committee Formulates Locust Control Measures, Nymphs Discovered in Yao Hua Township, a Suburb of Nanjing

Nanjing, 14th (Central News Agency telegram) - The Cooperative Enterprise Committee of the Executive Yuan, alarmed by the discovery of locust plagues in Yao Hua Township, a suburb of Nanjing, has specially formulated temporary locust control measures and telegraphed orders to cooperative societies in various places to immediately implement them. It is also issuing notices to mutual aid societies to investigate whether there are locust plagues or migratory locusts in their localities and nearby areas. If any are discovered, they should be reported immediately to their respective branch offices to urgently plan control measures. When locust plagues are discovered, each branch office should quickly supervise members and farmers to thoroughly cooperate in exterminating them to prevent them from spreading. In areas where locust plagues are more severe, each branch office should consider providing members and farmers with locust control equipment or offering prices to purchase locust carcasses as an incentive. When each branch office is carrying out locust control, it should maintain close contact with local administrative organs in order to achieve cooperative control effects.

Nanjing, 14th (Central News Agency telegram) - The Executive Yuan's Food Increase Promotion Committee, due to the discovery of nymphs in the countryside near Yao Hua Township, a suburb of Nanjing, a few days ago, convened relevant agencies to discuss effective sealing measures. Yesterday, Secretary-General Huang Zhao of the committee, together with representatives from the Ministry of Industry and Commerce's Department of Agriculture and Forestry, the Cooperative Committee, the Central Agricultural Experiment Institute, the Rural Construction Committee, and allied agencies, went to Majiachong area north of Yao Huamen Station on the Nanjing-Shanghai Railway to inspect the situation. Many nymphs were found within the wheat fields in that area, and there were also small nymphs on the barren land. Many were found in the soil. Inspections were conducted in various places south of the railway line where damage was reported, and it was estimated that several hundred acres of fields had been affected. The farmers were immediately instructed to widen and deepen the existing field ditches, fill them with water, and drip kerosene on the water surface to prevent the invasion of young nymphs. The young nymphs immediately died upon contact with the kerosene. Currently, the Agricultural Policy Committee is working with relevant agencies to discuss and implement extermination measures. Fearing that similar insect pests will occur in farmland throughout the country, the committee has already urged prompt capture and killing of any locusts or nymphs to prevent them from spreading.

Wuhu, 14th (Central News Agency telegram) - Dangtu dispatch: Locusts were discovered in Dafeng Guocaoguzhou in the third district of this county a few days ago, damaging 20 acres of fields.

### Current Situation in Jiading

— Zhi Cheng

Brief Overview of History

Jiading County was [a location]. In the Yuan Dynasty, it was changed to Jiading Prefecture, and in the Ming Dynasty, it was demoted to a county under Suzhou Prefecture. In the Qing Dynasty, it belonged to Zhen, with 62 townships. According to recent statistics on the Baojia system, there are 500 books, 6 Bao, 5,226 Jia, 53,089 households, and a total population of 221,0857. The county seat has only 35,651 residents, accounting for 16% of the total.

Historical Sites and Culture

Since the Han and Jin dynasties, Jiading's culture has produced many heroic figures and literati. The reporter only stayed in the city for one day and went to the market once, seeing no less than three or four memorial arches for women of chastity and filial piety. Near the south gate of the city, there is a Confucian temple. Two righteous men from this county, Mr. Hou and Mr. Huang, gathered righteous soldiers to resist the enemy and firmly defended the city walls for more than 20 days. Due to lack of outside reinforcements, the city was breached, and the two gentlemen led their families to their deaths. Regarding literati, in the Qing Dynasty, giants of Confucian classics, such as Qian Daxin, and giants of historiography, such as Wang Mingsheng, emerged. Talented people in poetry, calligraphy, and painting emerged in large numbers, which is also a characteristic. Before the incident, schools were abundant and education was developed. There were 300 schools of all levels in the county; now there are only 100 schools, including one county-run middle school, three private middle schools, 24 county-run primary schools, and more than 70 private primary schools. The number of students is only over 10,000. Students' levels are deteriorating due to the influence of family, environment, life, and teachers. It is unbearable to look back on. The authorities have difficulty finding relief measures due to financial constraints.

Farmland Life

The main agricultural products are cotton and rice. The county's fields are known as "70% cotton, 30% rice". Even with maximized cultivation, the amount of rice obtained is not enough to supply the food for all the people of Jiading, so rice is entirely imported from Changshu, Kunshan, Taicang, and other areas. The early rice harvest this year is still good, but the late rice and vegetables have been greatly affected by last year's frost disaster, and the harvest is worrying.

Field rent is divided into two types: wet and dry, i.e., rice fields and cotton fields. Last year, rice fields were four dou per mu, and cotton fields were 3,500 yuan per mu. The current price of a field is about 200,000 to 400,000 yuan per mu, depending on the quality of the field. A field burden is about 30,000 yuan. Therefore, cotton farmers believe that the difference between the current cotton and rice field taxes is too large and unfair. They have petitioned the county government to calculate the cotton field tax at one dou of rice as well, but so far it has not been resolved.

The people of Jiading mostly rely on agriculture for a living, followed by handicrafts, with yellow grass industry and bamboo carving industry being famous. The yellow grass industry is concentrated in the Chenggiao and Xuhang towns in the eastern countryside, with about 10,000 workers. The products include handbags, slippers, etc., which are sold throughout Jiangsu and Zhejiang. The bamboo carving industry started in the late Ming Dynasty and reached its peak during the Qianlong period of the Qing Dynasty. The products include stationery, daily necessities, and ornamental items, which are known to the world for their exquisite craftsmanship. Currently, it is being gradually eliminated due to reduced sales affected by the war. In addition, there are also cotton textiles (such as cotton cloth, towels), liquor, and mint, etc., which are also exported.

Local prices are similar to those in Shanghai, that is, they continue to rise periodically. For example, the price of rice, which is dependent on other places, was around 110,000 on May 6. The prices of other items such as fish, meat, eggs, and vegetables are also comparable to those in Shanghai.

Public Security and Construction

Public security in Jiading is quite peaceful. In addition to more than 100 police officers and a security team squadron stationed locally, there is also a Japanese military police team to maintain order together. Therefore, no major accidents have occurred. As for construction, in order to meet the needs of wartime, such as repairing roads and bridges to facilitate transportation, registering industrial and commercial businesses to improve management, establishing demonstration morning markets to promote improved seeds to increase production, organizing self-defense groups, and strengthening the Baojia system, all are being promoted and implemented.

Improvement of Cotton Production

In order to meet the needs of wartime, the Chinese and Japanese authorities are working hard to develop cotton production in Central China and have established the Central China Cotton Production Improvement Association. Its purpose is to develop cotton in Central China, first focusing on increasing production, and also aiming to achieve rapid improvement in variety. Regarding the cultivation of excellent varieties, it fully respects and utilizes the traditional experience. As for upland cotton, research is being conducted to achieve improvement.

Jiading initially only had an office under the Shanghai branch. Recently, due to the best results, the scope has been expanded, and the office has been changed to a branch. The local cotton quality is relatively poor, and only 16-count yarn can be spun. The Jinzi cotton and Dezi cotton produced by the improvement can spin 24 to 28-count yarn. At the beginning of the establishment, the county had a trial planting field of 150 mu outside the East Gate, and villagers had a special seed collection area of 3,000 mu. Technicians and technicians provided on-site guidance, and during the sowing period, lectures were held to explain sowing techniques and reasons, and cotton exhibitions were held. Currently, seed collection groups in various villages have about 24,000 mu. Last year's yield was 150 catties per mu. Based on past situations, the area is increasing year by year, so the organization is also expanding. Since last year, offices and resident stations have been established in various villages such as Nanxiang, Malu, and Xuhang.

Farmers are given in-kind allocations of goods at reasonable prices, such as fertilizer powder and rapeseed cake. Those who perform well in planting or spinning cotton are rewarded with commendations and cash.

Cooperative Enterprise

The Jiading Cooperative Branch is managed by the "Cooperative Enterprise Committee of the Executive Yuan" and was established in July of the 32nd year of the Republic (1943). Currently, there are more than 30,000 members. The funds within the society are more than 1.5 million yuan, which can be borrowed from local banks when necessary. Members are required to pay 50 yuan per household, and the current president is Yang Chougu (former Qingpu County magistrate), who is astute in handling affairs. The county government assisted him in difficult and complex matters.

Eight out of ten members are farmers, and the rest are local residents who lack an understanding of cooperative enterprises. The villagers originally hoped that after joining, they could get inexpensive allocated goods. In fact, due to limited funds, especially with the continuous rise in prices, it is difficult to purchase goods. Recognizing this, the authorities ordered an increase in funds to 500 per household. However, the villagers cannot get what they want after joining and are quite disappointed, so the capital increase has not been successful.

Since April of last year, when Jiading, Chongming, Baoshan, and Shenjiang were designated as agricultural increase production areas, the society established an agricultural section, focusing on rural production. The technical director is Zhao Jianjin, and there are 11 technicians, all trained at Shanghai University and experienced. There is a demonstration farm outside the East Gate of the city, covering an area of about 50 mu, engaged in improving seeds. There are also two specially contracted farms, located six li outside the West Gate. Recently, the authorities ordered it to form its own factories to produce matches, cotton yarn, native cloth, etc. for the purpose of reasonably priced allocation to farmers.

Regarding rural loans, contact was made with the Bank of Communications, but due to complicated procedures and the fact that the amount of loans was around 30,000 yuan, it did not help farmers. For example, the price of each cow is more than one million yuan, so no further contact was made.

Transportation Overview

The terrain is flat and the rivers are accessible in all directions. The main rivers are the Liu River on the northern border of Taicang and the Wusong River on the southern border of Qingpu, both running from west to east. There are many rivers connecting the two rivers, the more important ones being Hengtang, which runs from Luduqiao through the county seat to Nanxiang, and Yantietang, which runs through Waigang and Fangtai, both flowing in a northwest-southeast direction. In addition, Xietang runs parallel to the Liu River, passing through Waigang and the county seat to Luodian in Baoshan. These rivers all have the benefit of shipping.

Land transportation includes the Nanjing-Shanghai Railway, which crosses the southern border, with Nanxiang, Huangdu, and Anting stations; the Baoluo Road and Luojia Road connecting the county to Baoshan and Luodian. The Shanghai-Taicang Road connects with Shanghai, passing through Nanyang and other places in Jiading. The road is 37 kilometers long, and the coal paving is 6 meters wide. The road conditions were poor after the incident, and many of the road bridges were destroyed, making driving difficult. It was necessary to get out of the car and walk when encountering bridges. Since the Reconstruction Bureau started repairs, it has improved slightly, but vehicles with heavy loads are still suffering. Currently, the China Central Long-Distance Bus Company and other private transportation companies operate on this road, all departing from Shanghai, and the fare is between 5,000 and 7,000 yuan. There are small steamer routes from Tieshang to the county seat, and small steamers from Shanghai to Suzhou also pass through Huangdu and Anting stations.

It is understood that the distribution method for the penalties has been officially decided by the bureau: 50% will be turned over to the treasury, 10% will be turned over to the bureau, and 40% will be used for awards. The preliminary investigation work in the city's suburban areas has been completed, and the second investigation will begin soon. The preliminary investigation procedures in the old eight and two districts have been started in each district, but due to the heavy workload, it is planned to close the city's suburban investigation personnel to assist in the matter. Regarding the business tax payable by various businesses that handle household allocations of rice, coal balls, matches, and soap, the bureau has approved the request of the relevant industry associations to allow a 50% reduction in taxation. The non-household allocation business will still be taxed at the prescribed rate. It is also learned that the Business Tax Section of the bureau originally scheduled to hold a meeting of the directors of the business tax collection offices in each district once a week. Now, as instructed by Director Luo, it has been decided to hold the meeting once a week. The meeting objectives are: to hear reports, to review work, and to convey orders.

### Registration of Major Commodities Should Be Carried Out Within the Time Limit; Those Who Fail to Register Will Be Punished

In order to crack down on hoarding and profiteering and suppress prices, the Municipal Economic Bureau has held a registration of major commodities in the city for one month, from April 16 to May 15. It has specifically ordered the industry associations of various industries to forward letters to all member businesses, requiring them to fill out the forms and apply for registration of all major commodity inventories within the scope of registration within the time limit. Now that the registration deadline is approaching, many member businesses have not yet completed the registration procedures, which is wrong. The bureau recently convened a discussion meeting with the chairpersons of the industry associations of various industries, explaining the significance of this registration of major commodities, and urged the industry associations to strictly urge all member businesses to complete the registration procedures before the deadline. Businesses that have not registered after the deadline will be severely punished in accordance with the law and will not be leniently treated.

### Convenient Industrial and Commercial Registration Procedures

Since the Municipal Bureau of Economic Affairs began actively organizing industrial and commercial registrations to manage various industrial and commercial sectors and protect public legal rights, it has achieved remarkable progress. For those who had previously applied for registration but had not yet received their business licenses, the bureau, after ordering its departments to strictly and swiftly review them, immediately approved their issuance, making the procedures convenient and quick. Therefore, various industrial and commercial firms that had not yet applied for registration have all automatically applied. The Municipal Bureau of Economic Affairs, out of consideration for the hardships of businesses, not only does not penalize those who have delayed registration, but also immediately approves and notifies them to collect their licenses after investigating and confirming that their declared capital and business facts match the actual situation. Recently, the number of industrial and commercial firms that have applied for registration and received licenses within the past month is extremely large.

Investigation of the Taishan Baojia District by Qichang

The Taishan Baojia District was reorganized from the former Kuifei Baojia District. The district stretches east from Qingcheng Road, west to Chongqing Road, south from Hefei Road, and north to Great Shanghai Road. It includes six Lianbao (joint security districts), 106 Bao, and 1,207 Jia, with a current population of 200,000, 7,200 merchant households, 110 special households, 7,854 registered households, and 38,239 attached households. The district is lined with shops and is the essence of Shanghai's commercial area, occupying an extremely important position in terms of finance. The Baojia tax collected in March and April totaled over 9.83 million yuan. Recently, it is also planning to raise 23.07 million yuan for air defense expenses, which will begin soon.

The district is adjacent to the Nanshi, Laozha, and Huangpu districts, with extremely convenient transportation. Due to the prosperity of economic avenues, there are many gatherings of various members, which inevitably leads to those who would take risks. As a result, more theft cases occur. Recently, the Taishan District Police Sub-bureau issued a notice, instructing residents to pay attention to several key points. Because it can serve as a reference for other Baojia districts, it is briefly recorded below:

1.  For alleys with two or more interconnected exits, only one exit should be left open after 7 PM every evening, and the remaining alley gates should be closed uniformly.
2.  Each household or business should close its doors after 7 PM every evening and should not open them easily unless it is a familiar person.
3.  Each household should have at least one whistle.
4.  The telephone numbers of the Taishan Sub-bureau and the fire department should be written next to the telephone.
5.  If a thief breaks into the house, quickly escape out the door or enter a neighboring room, lock the door, and blow the whistle or shout for help, so that nearby police officers or civilian defense team members can rush to the scene.
6.  After the thief escapes, immediately follow him while sounding the alarm and shouting loudly to attract the attention of the police or civilian defense team members.
7.  Civilian defense team members should immediately implement a blockade upon hearing the alarm or being alerted by someone.
8.  Establish communication between households, such as doorbells, to facilitate the exchange of information during a burglary.
9.  Identify the age, appearance, clothing, and special features of the thief and immediately report it to the police station.
10. Always have someone sleep in the store at night, and do not lock the store door, to show that there is manpower inside.

Short Comment

Strict Light Control

The Air Defense Authority of this city has decided that from today onwards, strict light control will be implemented regularly from 10 PM to sunrise the next day. During this time, residents are absolutely prohibited from having any light leaking outside.

We have repeatedly pointed out that there should be no light leaking outside during the light control period. We believe that it is extremely easy for residents to ensure that no light leaks outside, simply by having shielding equipment and paying attention to using it properly. Moreover, residents who can shield well and prevent light from leaking are complying with air defense regulations and will not be interfered with by the authorities. At the same time, once they develop the habit, they will not be caught off guard in the event of an air raid, and they will not become bombing targets due to light leaks, which is protecting their own safety. Therefore, preventing light from leaking is something that citizens should do for their own safety.

Now that the authorities have announced that strict light control will be implemented regularly from today onwards, we hope that citizens will pay close attention, especially residents of general high-rise buildings, who must personally inspect and not delegate it to servants. At the same time, we hope that police and air defense personnel will fully perform their duties and strictly correct any violators, regardless of who they are.

This Newspaper's Free Education Staff Holds First Gathering

To Review Practical Problems and Exchange Remedial Opinions

The ten free elementary schools organized by the Free Education Committee of this newspaper, with 25 teachers and 10 volunteer committee members, held their first gathering last Sunday (the 13th) at Taishan Park. The weather was clear and the breeze was gentle, and everyone present was in high spirits. First, they invited photographers Huang Ningmin and Chen Boying to take pictures. The meeting began at 9:30 AM. Everyone introduced themselves, and the principals of each school reported on the school's situation in turn, exchanging opinions on all issues, such as the difficulties encountered in teaching and administrative matters, remedial measures for student absenteeism, teacher visits to student families to integrate education with life, and how to take care of children's health in the summer. After detailed review and discussion of various issues, Ms. Zhao Yizhi from Laibao Huayi School was invited to give a lecture on "Examples of Visiting Student Families." The hardship of students dropping out of school because of family difficulties and using sleep to cope with hunger was vividly described, not only deeply moving those present, but also arousing great sympathy from the hundreds of tourists who were listening in.

Afterwards, a story chorus sang a rowing song, and the meeting ended on a high note.

Mr. Yang Guoshen's Altruism and Public Spirit

The free school gathering was held at the Minle Teahouse in Taishan Park. The owner of the teahouse, Mr. Yang Guoshen, attended as an observer. Upon hearing about the hardship of impoverished students, he expressed deep sympathy. In addition to donating 15,000 yuan on the spot for the free school's summer medicine expenses, he also offered to donate 20,000 yuan per month to each school for student tea and water expenses until the end of the semester, and to donate five dozen enamel cups. It is estimated that the donation will be over 100,000 yuan by the end of the summer vacation at the end of August. Mr. Yang's altruism and enthusiasm are admirable to all at the free school. According to reports, Mr. Yang was originally the owner of the Minle Teahouse in Daxing Park, but has recently moved to Taishan Park because the park is temporarily closed. His courage to do what is right is truly commendable. Also, Mr. Yang's relative, Mr. Wu Zaixin, who was also present as an observer, was equally enthusiastic and generously donated 20,000 yuan for the free school's summer medicine expenses, which is also admirable.

Ningbo Third Elementary School Students Donate Money and Books Four Times

A letter from the entire student body of Ningbo Third Elementary School in Shanghai states: "Since your newspaper launched the "Free School Fund" in mid-March, more than two months have passed. We have repeatedly heard the teachers' earnest guidance and thought of the pain of impoverished children unable to attend school, and we were deeply moved. Some saved their snack money, some saved their fruit money, some even donated their favorite toys to help, and they also donated all the old books they had read. Some turned to others for donations, and some even spent money to buy books from the book stalls to donate. There have been three times previously. Today, we newly donated 23,200 yuan and 78 books, which we are sending with this letter to express our little enthusiasm. Although it is a drop in the bucket, it is only to express our sympathy.
