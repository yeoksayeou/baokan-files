[Our Newspaper] San Francisco, 26th - Midnight broadcast states: Chiang Kai-shek's eldest son, Chiang Ching-kuo, arrived in Moscow on Tuesday, intending to meet with the Foreign Ministers of the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union. However, this news has not been officially confirmed by Chongqing. Moreover, in the past 24 hours, Du Yuming's troops advanced 40 miles in temperatures of zero to twenty degrees [Fahrenheit], and are expected to receive Shenyang and Harbin around New Year's Day.

[Central News Agency, Jinzhou, 26th] After entering Dahushan, the National Army has stationed in Tangjiawopu, approximately twenty *li* northeast of Dahushan Railway Station.

[United Press, Chongqing, 26th] News revealed today: General Du Yuming's troops are using Jinzhou as their base and are currently advancing in a fan-shaped formation along four routes to fully control the southern part of the Nine Eastern Provinces. Troops advancing rapidly from Goubangzi have already occupied the major city of Weiding (transliteration) north of the Beining Railway. Another unit is advancing towards Yingkou. However, the National Army that has reached the outskirts of Shenyang is still awaiting Soviet permission to enter the city.

[United Press, Beiping, 26th] According to the most reliable sources: Before completing negotiations with the Soviets regarding the National Army's entry into Xinmin, Du Yuming's troops will remain in their current positions. Xinmin will be the last stop before the National Army enters Shenyang. Du Yuming's troops encountered minimal Communist resistance during their rapid advance.

### Northeast Headquarters to Move to Tianjin or Jin County; Du Yuming Commands at the Front; Communist Forces in Rehe Province to Be Cleared Within Ten Days

[United Press, Beiping, 25th] Local Chinese newspapers reported today: Chiang Kai-shek's Northeast Headquarters will soon move to Tianjin or Jin County because General Du Yuming's military action to clear out the Communist forces within Rehe Province has already begun. His troops are currently attacking the Communist forces concentrated north of Qinghuazi. It is reported that General Du has left Beiping for the front lines to personally direct all operations, with the aim of clearing Rehe within ten days and joining forces with Soviet troops near Shenyang. It is reported that a large number of National Army troops are being transported by American ships to Huludao to enter the Nine Eastern Provinces. General Albert Wedemeyer, Commander of the U.S. Forces in the China Theater, will soon come here by plane for inspection. Furthermore, according to authoritative sources from the United Press: It was originally planned to move Chiang Kai-shek's headquarters to Changchun, but this plan has been temporarily abandoned due to the disruption of railway transportation.

[United Press, Chongqing, 26th] A newspaper reports: Guo Ding, under General Du in the Northeast, will soon be transferred to the Fifth Army. Currently, there are only two armies in the Northeast: the 13th and 52nd Armies. The 94th Army, currently in Beiping, is scheduled to be transported by air to Changchun, while the Fifth Army, currently in Yunnan Province, has received orders to move to Haiphong, awaiting American ships to go to the Northeast. Since December 23rd, the Communist forces have not resisted the advancing National Army. The Communist forces retreat upon the arrival of the government troops.

[Central News Agency, Jinzhou, 24th] After completing the first stage of taking over defense duties after exiting the [Shanhaiguan] Pass, our army has now launched the second phase of work. After Director Du ordered the troops to depart on the 22nd, they advanced 90 *li* on the 23rd, reaching Beijin County and Ping'anbao, north of Goubangzi. A Central News Agency reporter paid a special visit to Director Du before he departed for the front lines, first visiting Director Du's military affairs office. Mr. Du said: The people of the Northeast have suffered unspeakable hardships under the brutal rule of the Japanese for fourteen years. Now, unexpectedly, after victory, they are once again ravaged by the Communist forces. The innocent people are suffering. Those who witness the reality are all in tears. According to the general account of the fathers of the Northeast: The calamities suffered in the past three months are even worse than the brutal rule of the Japanese for fourteen years. Therefore, in the Northeast, men, women, old and young, all hope that the National Army will arrive soon to save the people from fire and water. When the reporter continued to inquire about the situation of the people of the Northeast assisting the National Army, Mr. Du replied: Since the National Army exited the Pass, it has been deeply loved by the people. They are extremely enthusiastic in maintaining order, providing supplies, and so on, at any time and anywhere. Even many people are willing to contribute all their possessions to the National Army. The National Army does not commit the slightest offense, and has received great cooperation from the people. What is most deeply moving is that wherever the troops arrive, the local people automatically rush to repair the transportation lines destroyed by the Communist forces, so that the National Army can advance without obstruction. As a result of fourteen years of Japanese oppression in the Northeast, the people's patriotism has become even stronger. When the reporter mentioned the food and clothing situation of the National Army after exiting the Pass, Mr. Du said: There are currently no difficulties in supplying the troops after exiting the Pass. There is ample supply of coarse grains in the Northeast. After the entire Northeast is taken over, all supplies will be used locally.

### On the Eve of the Political Consultative Conference; All Parties Actively Prepare; Definite Date Not Yet Set; Special Envoy Marshall Busy Listening to Opinions

[Our Newspaper, Chongqing, 26th Special Telegram] After Marshall arrived in Chongqing, the Communist Party representatives stated to the Special Envoy that the Communist Party is willing to unconditionally cease military actions. However, the Communist Party representatives in today's talks between the government and the Communist Party reportedly still have the condition that Communist Party personnel hold government positions as a prerequisite. As for the Political Consultative Conference, all parties are actively preparing. The Democratic League, the Youth Party, and the Communist Party all have secretariats engaged in work. It is rumored that the conference will be held in the middle of next month.

[Reuters, Chongqing, 26th] Zhou Enlai, the CCP representative, stated yesterday that the Communist Party will formally submit a written proposal for an unconditional ceasefire today when the Nationalists and Communists resume negotiations, which have been suspended for five weeks. "We urgently desire an immediate cessation of fighting, the importance of this step is above any event." The submission of this proposal has been approved by Mao Zedong. The on-and-off negotiations between the Nationalists and Communists have dragged on for more than a year. The last time the negotiations were suspended, it has now been five weeks.

[Associated Press, Chongqing, 25th] The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) has decided to propose in writing an unconditional cessation of hostilities. China may have a chance of a truce by the New Year. Although some say that this matter is by no means as simple as it appears on the surface, it can be seen that the CCP has made concessions, so it is particularly noteworthy. The CCP previously requested that the Chinese army retreat to its original defenses at the time of the Japanese surrender, but now it seems that the Communist forces are prepared to "freeze" both sides in their current locations. If a ceasefire can indeed be declared as a result, the work of the Political Consultative Conference will be greatly facilitated. The conference is expected to convene in January.

[United Press, Chongqing, 26th] The Political Consultative Conference, originally scheduled to be held yesterday, is now [unclear], but political leaders are very busy during the Christmas holidays, conducting preliminary discussions. It is said that the consultation meeting may start as scheduled on January 1. U.S. Special Envoy to China, General Marshall, has now become the center of Chinese political activity. It is believed that the leaders of all political parties want to know Marshall's position before attending the consultation meeting. According to Chinese newspapers, Special Envoy Marshall spoke with the Communist Party delegation for one hour at his residence on the first day of this week and told the representatives that he was prepared to hold informal meetings with leaders of the Communist Party, Kuomintang, China Democratic League, China Youth Party, and non-partisan leaders in Chongqing.

[United Press, Chongqing, 26th] General Marshall received four representatives from the Democratic League today to listen to their opinions on Chinese politics. Minister Wu of the Central Propaganda Department declared today: He does not know whether General Marshall will participate in the Political Consultative Conference, but the Chinese government will never hinder the efforts of the special envoy to promote the common interests of the two countries.

### New Trends Brewing in the Communist Army; Plot to Concentrate Forces in Hebei and Shandong; Military Commission Spokesperson Denies Rumors Reported by Xinhua

[This Newspaper Chongqing, 26th] Amidst calls from all sectors of the country for the government to resign and sue for peace, the recent movements of the Communist army are now brewing new trends. The troops besieging Guisui and Baotou are recently withdrawing to the Northeast. The troops that captured Chengde have also withdrawn. Their conspiracy seems to be to concentrate forces and take action in Hebei and Shandong, and to cut off the passage between Inner Mongolia and the Northeast. Regarding the center of gravity of the Communist Party's military and political affairs, it is gradually shifting from Yan'an to Zhangjiakou. It is generally believed that the prospects for the current unity talks and the Political Consultative Conference to be held next month cannot be viewed with excessive optimism.

[Central News Agency Chongqing, 26th] A spokesperson for the Military Commission stated: The "Chongqing Xinhua Daily" published on February 13th the statement that "Chief of Staff He once met with Sakai in Beiping and agreed to turn the Japanese army in Tianjin and Beiping into an anti-communist army." This is purely a complete fabrication, attempting to confuse the public.

[Central News Agency Tianjin, 25th] Communist troops near Tianjin have recently been buying up banknote paper at high prices and hiring printing workers from the Tianjin Yi Zhong Company to massively print counterfeit banknotes for use in Tianjin, disrupting the financial system.

[Central News Agency Jinzhou, 25th] The Communist army arbitrarily issues banknotes in the north, forcing the people to use them, stipulating that the exchange rate with the puppet Manchukuo currency is five to one. The people cannot bear the suffering and are fleeing in droves.

### Pacification Supervision Group Returns to Wuxi from Jiangyin

### Cultural Circles in the Capital and the Provisional Capital Issue Declarations on the Current Situation; Hoping the Communist Party Will Avert Disaster

[Central News Agency Nanjing, 26th] At the first fellowship meeting held by the Nanjing cultural figures at the Cultural Movement Committee of Nanjing City, opinions were exchanged on the current situation, and a declaration on the current situation was passed. It has now been finalized and the full text is published, stating briefly: Peace and unity are necessary conditions for carrying out the great task of nation-building. Therefore, standing from the position of the people, we sincerely hope that the Political Consultative Conference can proceed smoothly and achieve satisfactory results. We are willing to provide four points of opinion on the current situation. First, we hope that all representatives, especially the representatives of the Chinese Communist Party, can prioritize the nation and the people, not create problems, and not propose unacceptable conditions. Second, we hope that the Chinese Communist Party will resolutely return its troops to the state, listen to the government's reorganization and disbandment, and that political parties should compete with political views, not with force; compete in the political arena, not on the battlefield. Third, we do not wish to list the various deceptive propaganda and illegal crimes of the Chinese Communist Party. We urge the Chinese Communist Party to listen to the people's demands for peaceful residence, return to their hometowns, and oppose the cries of rebellion. Immediately lay down the butcher knife, pull back from the precipice, and submit the matter to the scrutiny of the world. Fourth, the ultimate goal of the Chinese National Revolution is to implement democratic constitutionalism. Now that the National Assembly is scheduled to convene, we can only move forward along this correct path. We hope that the Political Consultative Conference is a bridge to the National Assembly, not a substitute for the National Assembly. We hope that the government's composition will be strengthened as a result of this conference, but there should be no so-called "coalition government" plan, and we must cherish the national center that the people unanimously support.

[Central News Agency Chongqing, 26th] The liaison conference of magazine publishers in the provisional capital recently issued a declaration on the current situation, stating briefly: Our country's eight-year long war of resistance against Japan has finally achieved the goal of final victory. During these eight years, the entire nation paid an unprecedented and unparalleled price. The leaders above pondered deeply and worked tirelessly, while the people below left their wives and mothers, economized on food and clothing. The soldiers on the front lines even fought against the enemy's artillery with their blood and flesh. The ultimate goal is today's victorious outcome, a unified situation, and a democratic and peaceful country. The government is about to convene the National Assembly and return power to the people. Anyone who dares to commit a great outrage and violate the will of the people is a public enemy of the people. We want peace, and the first thing we oppose is internal strife. We want democracy, and the first thing we oppose are those who undermine the law. We want unity, and the first thing we oppose is separatism. We want construction, and the first thing we oppose is destruction. The Communist Party has violated the will of the people, launched internal strife, and obstructed nation-building. Knowing that its strength is insufficient and that it cannot withstand the anger of the masses, it should repent and abandon its selfish desires, and use political means to resolve all problems. Communist Party members with discerning friends, listen to the cries of the people! We are people who promote public opinion and speak for the people. What our hearts perceive as dangerous, we must speak out. To pull back from the precipice and turn danger into safety is the only good opportunity at present. It is difficult to withstand the anger of the masses, and it is impossible to achieve one's selfish desires. This is an unchanging lesson from ancient times. We dare to offer our sincere words to the people and to the Communist Party.

### Breaking a Three-Month-Long Stalemate; Moscow Conference Concludes; Final Communiqué and Protocol to Be Released Today

[Reuters London, 26th] Well-informed sources in London expect the final communiqué and protocol of the Moscow Three-Power Foreign Ministers Conference to be released within 48 hours; there is even a possibility of release tonight (early Thursday morning Shanghai time). According to this agency's diplomatic correspondent, the speed of the three foreign ministers' talks was largely due to their willingness to spend Christmas working. If there are no other delays, British Foreign Secretary Bevin may return to the United Kingdom before the end of this week, with approximately two weeks to prepare for the United Nations General Assembly scheduled to convene on January 10th.

[United Press Moscow, 26th] The British, American, and Soviet foreign ministers met on Christmas Day at 4:00 PM and did not adjourn until 9:30 PM, making it the longest meeting to date. Observers commenting on the interim report announced by the conference consider it to be a sign of success. The heads of the British and American governments have taken a cautious attitude towards the development of the conference, which is surprising and even warns that the foreign ministers' conference will not issue a communiqué at all, but the foreign ministers' conference has at least produced a significant result for the agreement on the Balkan Treaty. The three Deputy Foreign Ministers will soon resume work in London to discuss draft treaties for Romania, Bulgaria, Hungary, and Finland. The London Five-Power Foreign Ministers Conference in October of this year was stranded because of this issue. Within the next four months or less, approximately before May 1, 1946, all countries that participated in the European War will hold the first peace conference of the Second World War.

[United Press Moscow, 25th] According to authoritative sources today, U.S. Secretary of State Byrnes has expressed considerable satisfaction with the achievements of the Three-Power Foreign Ministers Conference. Concrete agreements have been reached on a number of unresolved issues. Washington is even more pleased with the achievements of the conference, which are far beyond what was expected. According to well-informed sources, the Soviet Union has not yet obtained atomic secrets, but it is reported that the three foreign ministers discussed the issue of global co-management of atomic energy at the meeting, based on the declarations of the United States, Britain, and Canada.

China Has Agreed to Convene a Peace Conference

[United Press Moscow, 26th] It is reported that China has agreed to the proposal of the three powers, namely, China will be listed as one of the five inviting countries, inviting twenty-one Allied countries to hold a United Nations Peace Conference after the draft treaties prepared by the three powers are completed.

[Reuters London, 26th] The ambassadors of China and France have been notified of events at the Three-Power Foreign Ministers Conference that directly affect the interests of China and France. It is reported that the Chinese government has expressed its agreement with the matters recommended in the first communiqué. US sources say that France has not yet expressed its agreement, but has not expressed its opposition either. Furthermore, according to this agency's diplomatic correspondent, the British public deeply hopes that the Moscow Conference can reach a resolution on the control of atomic energy, so that the United Nations Organization General Assembly to be convened on January 10th can proceed smoothly. It is commonly believed here that the success or failure of the conference can be used as an "acid test" for this matter. However, the resolution on atomic energy is a matter of trust, so there must first be cooperation between countries in other areas. For this reason, the first task of the Moscow Conference is to rebuild the international cooperation that failed at the London Foreign Ministers Conference. It is believed here that the first communiqué announced in Moscow will have a positive impact on the discussion of atomic policy.

[United Press Moscow, 25th] Byrnes, Bevin, and other members of the three countries' delegations were invited by Stalin to a Christmas Eve banquet at the Kremlin, and the hosts and guests were in a warm and friendly atmosphere.

### US and Soviet Union Discuss Korean Issue

No Signs of Agreement

[United Press Washington, 25th] Well-informed sources believe today that a plan for the independence of Korea may be formed at the Moscow Foreign Ministers Conference. These people point out that U.S. Secretary of State Byrnes is rumored to have brought instructions to the Soviet Union, urging the immediate realization of Korean independence and opposing the Soviet side's trusteeship proposal. However, as of now, there are no signs that the three powers have reached any conclusion. The U.S. position is that, in accordance with the Cairo Declaration, Korea should be allowed to hold a popular vote to choose its own form of government. Observers point out that the Soviet side has suggested that the U.S. and Soviet occupied zones should be merged, and that one country should be responsible for trusteeship, so that the fertile farmland in the south and the industry in the north can be connected during a certain prescribed period before the popular vote is held. But at present, the 38th parallel divides Korea into two. The Soviet side believes that if such a boundary continues to exist, it is almost impossible to hold a national popular vote.

### British Dominion Participation in the Peace Conference Issue

Three Powers Once Had a Dispute

[Reuters New York, 26th] The Washington correspondent of the New York Times stated that a dispute once arose in Moscow regarding the participation of British Dominions in the Peace Conference. The Soviet Union resolutely insisted that Australia, Canada, South Africa, and New Zealand were not independent countries and should be represented at the Peace Conference by the United Kingdom. British Foreign Secretary Bevin and U.S. Secretary of State Byrnes strongly opposed this, saying that Ireland is also a British Dominion, but has always maintained an independent posture and has never participated in the war. The Soviet Union then retorted that if British Dominions and India could participate, then every Soviet Republic should have the right to participate. U.S. Secretary of State Byrnes immediately said that if the Soviet Union insisted on having six votes, then each of the 48 states in the United States should also have one vote. As a result, a compromise was reached, and it was decided that all countries that actively participated in the war with their troops would be allowed to participate in the Peace Conference. (Note: This news has not yet been officially confirmed by British and American authorities.)

[Reuters London, 26th] British officials confirmed yesterday that India will also be able to participate in the second stage of peace negotiations with Germany's satellite countries. According to a Moscow radio broadcast on Monday, the peace treaties drafted by the five major foreign ministers will be submitted to the actively belligerent countries for discussion. Since India is one of the United Nations, it should participate in the United Nations general membership meeting to discuss the peace treaties.

### Outlook for the United Nations Organization General Assembly

[United Press Washington, 26th] The first General Assembly of the United Nations will open in London on January 10th, at which time a heated debate will unfold on the issue of maintaining world peace. All fifty-one member states of the General Assembly will be present. Due to procedural matters, the General Assembly will be divided into two sessions. The first session will begin on January 10th and will last for three weeks to two months, during which each member will establish agencies to make the United Nations General Assembly an executive body. The second session is expected to begin in April, most likely in the United States, as that country has been elected as the permanent headquarters of the United Nations Organization. The agenda for the London meeting does not include major issues such as the atomic bomb, but any country can freely raise similar urgent issues for discussion. The London meeting may be very slow, just like the San Francisco Conference, with representatives spending weeks and months in subcommittees, nitpicking over the wording of the charter. One of the main tasks of the first session will be to appoint six small countries as temporary members of the Security Council, while China, the United States, Britain, the Soviet Union, and France will be permanent members. The real work of maintaining peace is done by the Security Council, not the General Assembly. The first meeting of the General Assembly has a lot of work, but nothing particularly outstanding, mostly to establish the various agencies of the General Assembly and elect officers.

### American Thought Takes a Turn, Accepting World Government

[U.S. Information Service New York, 25th] The New York Times wrote today that American public opinion has recently shifted, moving closer to accepting the idea of ​​a world government, an idea that was unacceptable to most Americans not long ago. For example, the recent U.S. permission for international organizations to use U.S. military force to maintain peace would have been absolutely impossible twenty-six years ago, when the U.S. refused to join the League of Nations because it refused to use military force to assist international organizations.

### Possible Merger of Bulgaria and Yugoslavia

[United Press New York, 25th] Sulzberger, a special correspondent for the New York Times, telegraphed from London that the signs of a possible merger of Yugoslavia and Bulgaria in the Pan-Slavic movement are becoming increasingly prominent. The result "will completely transform the Balkans, and Italy, Turkey, and Greece will feel particularly uneasy." Sulzberger said that such a merger had been attempted once before, unsuccessfully, and is now awaiting two developments: the liquidation of the Bulgarian royal family and the signing of a peace treaty between Bulgaria and the Allied countries. The correspondent said that the reputation of the Bulgarian royal family is declining, and the establishment of a republic in Yugoslavia now has a sufficient stance. He said, "Marshal Tito mentioned this kind of federation when he was a guerrilla leader." and said that this plan now clearly awaits a decision from Moscow.

### US Troops in Iran Prepare to Withdraw

[United Press Baghdad, 26th] It was revealed today that in the past few days, U.S. troops will arrive in Iraq in accordance with the decision to withdraw from Iran on January 1st, in order to go to the Mediterranean port. The Iraqi government has granted permission to pass through and has prepared accommodations for them so that they can stay.

### Franco Regime

Becomes a Target of International Attack

[Reuters London, 26th] The New York Times' editorial yesterday said that the date of change of the Spanish regime is gradually approaching, and Spain becoming a target of international attack is a phenomenon that cannot be sustained for long. The recent note from the French government to the British and American governments was a call to attack the Franco regime. Although the contents of the note should not be disclosed, it is believed that France must have asked Britain and the United States to clarify their attitude towards Spain, and perhaps even advocated severing diplomatic relations with Spain, so that the Spanish government-in-exile established in Mexico could be recognized, and temporarily set up in French territory before moving into Madrid. France only has one representative in Madrid, and there is no embassy. The Soviet Union has not established any relations with the Franco government at all. The United Kingdom can recall its ambassador to Spain at any time and temporarily order him not to go to Madrid. Spain under Franco's rule has absolutely no hope of participating in the United Nations organization, and its economic relations with the world have been reduced to a minimum. The Franco regime is also constantly criticized by political figures in other countries.

### Soviet Union Deliberately Expands Its Influence; Crisis Lurks on the Turkish Border; Prompts Close Cooperation Between Britain and France in the Middle East

[Reuters London, 26th] The New York Times said that the three Soviet republics of Azerbaijan, Armenia, and Georgia are plotting to seize considerable land from Iran and Turkey. Although Iranian Azerbaijan still claims to be a part of Iran, if the Iranian government insists on not changing its form, it is feared that the government of Greater Tabriz will eventually merge with Baku. It is rumored that the two provinces of Gilan and Mazandaran in northern Iran are also launching separatist movements. The government of Georgia, Stalin's hometown, is also plotting to seize the two provinces of Kars and Ardahan in Turkey. According to the Treaty of Sèvres in 1920, the area should belong to Armenia, but since Kemal Atatürk rose to power and drove back the Greek troops, the Treaty of Sèvres has never been ratified. Three years later, the Treaty of Lausanne assigned the two areas to Turkey. Armenia once declared that Kars and Ardahan were its territory, but now Georgia claims that this was seized from Georgia. What the Moscow newspapers want to obtain is the entire northeast corner of Turkey, including the two ports of Trabzon and Rize, and control over the copper mining area. This obvious geopolitical action (which was Hitler's favorite term) aims to completely detach the entire eastern part of Turkey east of the Diyarbakır to Giresun line from Turkey. Nominally handed over to the Kurdish, Azerbaijani, Armenian, and Georgian peoples, it is actually controlled by the Soviet Union. The important highway from Trabzon through Erzurum to Iran allows Moscow's power to reach the border of Syria. Britain and the United States have not formally expressed their attitude towards the Soviet Union's request to acquire Kars and Ardahan. But it is expected that what Britain and the United States are satisfied with must be the maintenance of the status quo. If the Soviet Union believes that it is justified, it should formally ask the United Nations organization to decide. Technically speaking, before the treaty expires in April next year, the Soviet Union should continue to respect the borders of Turkey. The treaty recognizes the cession of Batumi to the Soviet Union and allows Turkey to retain Kars and Ardahan, but Trabzon and Lazistan are not mentioned. The land that Georgia is demanding includes a part of Turkish Armenia, whose residents are mostly Laz people. In short, the eastern border area of ​​Turkey is the area coveted by the Soviet Union. The development of the situation in the area will inevitably lead to close cooperation between Britain and France and the unity of the countries in the Middle East, otherwise there will be no way to resist the intrusion of Soviet power.

### The United States Values the Greek Election and Sends a Delegation to Observe

[United Press International, Washington, 25th] The United States is sending over six hundred representatives to various locations in Greece to observe the elections. The sheer number of representatives and the extensive scope of the plan can be considered unprecedented in history. In addition, the United Kingdom and France have also accepted Greece's invitation to send observers, but the Soviet Union has uniquely refused. The head of the U.S. delegation is former Under Secretary of State, Mr. Grady, who will cooperate with the State Department.

[United States Information Service, Washington, 25th] Greece will hold significant elections before the end of March. These elections will be a test of the curative power of democracy, and the American delegation may as well call themselves the prescribing physicians. It is imperative that these become the most democratic and reliable elections in Southeastern Europe. Only in this way can Greece have a stable government to confront all its difficulties.

### England's Largest Stadium

[United Press International, Glasgow, England, 26th] Hampden Park Stadium, with a seating capacity of 103,000, the largest stadium in England, was heavily damaged by fire today. Offices, dressing rooms, press boxes, restaurants, and the central part of the main grandstand were all affected by the fire.

### One of Japan's Elder Statesmen, Count Makino, Leader of Liberalism

[United Press International, Tokyo, 26th] Count Makino, former Minister of the Imperial Household, now 74 years old, lives quietly in a secluded villa near Tokyo, rarely leaving his home. According to well-informed sources in Japan, Makino was once forced to step down by the military clique, but now he has regained real power, resembling Japan's "Saionji" after the defeat. Emperor Hirohito once considered abdication after the Japanese military's complete surrender, but it was Makino who dissuaded him. Subsequently, the discussions of Hirohito's abdication vanished due to Makino's opposition. Foreign reporters wanting to interview him are told that Makino is old and doesn't concern himself with current affairs, and have personnel relay their opinions on the Japanese government to him. ... Ten years ago, he was considered a "dangerous liberal," but today he is once again trusted by Hirohito. The reason is none other than that three-time Prime Minister Konoe had already committed suicide by taking poison, and many of the Emperor's trusted confidants during the war were placed in prison by MacArthur's orders. Makino is the only surviving elder statesman. The changes of the world and the ups and downs of officialdom are not surprising. The new forces of the Makino faction include the current Prime Minister Shidehara (age 73), retired Admiral and current Privy Council President Suzuki (age 78), current Foreign Minister Yoshida (age 67), and former Minister of Home Affairs Matsudaira (age 68). These figures are those whom the Japanese military regarded as liberals, but if their liberalism is nothing more than outdated antiques, then it is still incompatible with the great changes Japan is facing today. Makino served as Minister of the Imperial Household for ten years beginning in 1925, and before that, he was Minister of the Interior for four years, so Hirohito.... Konoe's memoirs state that Emperor Hirohito's failure to actively intervene before the outbreak of the Pacific War was due to Makino's advice. Makino had secretly told Hirohito not to offer too many suggestions on political and diplomatic matters. Konoe also said that Makino advocated that the Japanese Constitution should be modeled after the British system. On December 26, 1935, Makino, unable to withstand the power of the military clique, announced his resignation. His successor, Saito, was killed in the "February 26 Incident" the following year. Marquis Kido told United Press reporters: "Makino had opposed the dangerous nature of the General Staff Headquarters," but ultimately there was nothing he could do. This summer, when Japan's situation was already hopeless, Suzuki was appointed Prime Minister, and he promptly accepted the Potsdam Declaration and announced the surrender. Yoshida is Makino's son-in-law. When Prince Higashikuni formed the cabinet, he appointed Yoshida as Foreign Minister. Shigemitsu, who had relied on Konoe for support, fell into obscurity. When Shidehara came out and reorganized the cabinet, Yoshida remained in his position, so Makino's influence can be imagined. Matsudaira is the father-in-law of Hirohito's older brother, Prince Chichibu. He served as Minister of the Imperial Household from 1936 to 1945 and had also served as ambassador to the United Kingdom, attending international conferences on several occasions and earning a reputation as an outstanding Japanese diplomat at the time. On March 10 of this year, he resigned due to the bombing and burning of the Imperial Palace. The relationships and past connections of all these people are very important in Japan and are factors that make up a new force around the Emperor. In addition, there is another key figure, retired Admiral Keisuke Okada. Okada is now 78 years old. He once served as Prime Minister and was also the target of the "February 26 Incident." After escaping by using a ruse, he remained in seclusion. At the time of the defeat, he was once again personally appointed by the Emperor, with Yoshida as a "messenger." This new force exchanged views with Makino several times and decided to recommend Shidehara as Prime Minister. According to unconfirmed reports: this new force has decided to make Matsudaira the future Prime Minister. Shidehara has stated that if the results of the next election show that the current cabinet is not representative of public opinion, he will voluntarily step aside and allow a multi-party cabinet to be formed. However, the current Shidehara cabinet will only be a transitional one, its mission being to promote "conservative liberalism" to preserve the imperial throne.

### The French Government Announces the Devaluation of the Franc to Encourage Exports and Aid Economic Recovery

[Reuters, Paris, 26th] The government officially announced yesterday that the new exchange rate for the French franc is set at 480 francs to one pound sterling, and 119.1 francs to one U.S. dollar. The original exchange rate was 200 francs to one pound sterling. The franc has been devalued six times since the last World War. The new exchange rate means that the gold value of the franc is only one-tenth of the franc of 1928. Yesterday, several French morning newspapers stated that the government intends to requisition foreign capital, specifically foreign currency, dividends from foreign stocks, foreign stocks held abroad, and foreign stocks held by French people within the country. The government will first requisition the first three categories, and the method for the fourth category has not yet been decided. Furthermore, according to this agency's financial correspondent, it was very appropriate to announce the devaluation of the franc while markets in various cities around the world were closed for Christmas. Prices and wages in France have increased, so the old exchange rate of 200 to one was no longer practical. It made French exports too expensive, resulting in imports far exceeding exports. As a result, France has incurred a substantial debt to the Bank of England. The new exchange rate of 480 to one was expected in London, and unofficial sources even said that the British government had expressed its agreement before the end of last week. Some reports from Paris said that due to pressure from the Communist Party, the French government initially intended to devalue the franc to 350 to one, but due to changes in the situation, it decided to devalue it to 480 to one in one fell swoop. The British side considers this a wise move. As for whether this devaluation of the franc will affect the franc's credibility, it depends on the reaction of the French people. If the French people believe that this is a reasonable countermeasure after the increase in prices and wages, then the devalued franc can remain stable. If the French people raise prices again as a result, and then wages have to be increased, it will inevitably lead to further inflation.

### British Naval Veteran, Admiral Keyes, Passes Away

[Reuters, London, 26th] Admiral Lord Keyes, a British naval veteran, passed away today after a three-year illness at the age of 73. He made significant contributions in the fight against German submarines during the First World War.

### United Nations Far Eastern Commission Members Depart from the United States for Japan Yesterday, Expected to Return to Washington in Mid-February

[United Press International, Washington, 26th] The entire members of the United Nations Far Eastern Commission are scheduled to depart for Japan this evening and are expected to return to Washington around February 15. The commission consists of representatives from ten countries. After discussing for two months, they have clearly stated that there are no major errors in MacArthur's measures in Japan. Most members have said that MacArthur's actions are trustworthy. The commission's task is to study how the directives issued by the United States to MacArthur are being implemented. So far, most of its time has been spent debating the directives themselves. The Basic Policy Committee, chaired by Australian Foreign Minister Evatt, has rewritten the original directives issued by the White House to MacArthur after Japan's surrender and distributed them to the ten governments for consideration. If approved, they can be sent to MacArthur. According to U.S. officials, the rewriting of the directives only makes the tone clearer and more forceful, so the U.S. government does not object. Some members of the commission now believe that the time is near for the commission to take over the actual power of formulating policies towards Japan. Once the strict military occupation period is over, the commission will move to Japan and issue orders directly to MacArthur. Therefore, in recent communiqués, the word "advisory" has been removed from the commission's name. Some also believe that if the Soviet Union does not join, the commission can become a powerful body for formulating policies. However, if U.S. Secretary of State Byrnes and Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov reach some kind of agreement on the establishment of a four-power control commission for Japan, as advocated by the Soviet Union, the commission can only retain its guiding position.

### Japanese Newspapers Still Emphasize the Seriousness of the Food Shortage

Japanese Farmers Refuse to Hand Over Food, Government Will Use Force

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 25th Dispatch] Although the Allied Headquarters recently stated that the Japanese people do have enough food, Japanese newspapers continue to publish various figures and articles describing the current situation throughout Japan to show that the Japanese people have not obtained enough food. Japanese Minister of Agriculture and Forestry Mitsuzo Matsumura, after recently inspecting agricultural areas, told the Japanese press yesterday that the situation is so serious that the Japanese government may be forced to take force against farmers who possess rice and other food but refuse to hand it over to the government. He stated that the establishment of a high-priced food market to attract farmers is something that the government cannot control. It is said that the Japanese government is considering a new price policy.

Men and women subjects of all races throughout the British Empire are transitioning from long periods of military service back to peaceful lives. Children can no longer fear the black nights of the blackout and can gather together in the light to celebrate Christmas. Young people should not evaluate life with the grim waste of war or the guilt of the first year of peace, but should aim for the best possible life and approach it with courage, kindness, and a sense of humor."

### Bombing Aids Archaeology, Some Documents Re-reveal Their Original Appearance

[United States Information Service, Washington, 25th] According to the International News Service: the American Geographical Society announced on the 25th that wartime bombing and military excavations have contributed greatly to the study of ancient conditions. For example, when constructing fortifications in Gibraltar, a cave was tunneled through. This cave was clearly inhabited during Roman times. As a result of the German bombing of Canterbury, England, a city dating back to the Roman conquest in 43 AD was exposed. Bomb craters east of London have revealed several Roman porcelain utensils in their original form. The excavation of airfields in England has uncovered an ancient Celtic wooden temple dating back to about 500 BC. Although the war has halted many scientific excavation projects, this exploration has not been interrupted in other parts of the world. Soviet scientists reported the discovery of tribal footprints dating from 25,000 to 100,000 years ago. They discovered a giant fossil skeleton in northern Himachal, with a skull circumference of 33 inches and a tibia length of 33 inches. The University of Chicago reported the discovery of a city 250 miles from Baghdad, divided into sixteen layers of architecture, built layer by layer. A temple built by the cavalry of Ptolemy III was also discovered on the Egyptian plateau. British explorers have located the north magnetic pole in the center of the Smaragdine Islands, which is 530 miles closer to the geographical North Pole than previously thought. It is only 770 miles from the North Pole on the Earth's axis.

Continued News on County Issuance of Substitute Currency: It has already been reported in this newspaper that the Songjiang County government issued 21.5 million yuan in substitute currency for the purchase of military grain. Now, more than 50 representatives of rice merchants in the city went to the county government on the afternoon of the 23rd to petition for a reduction in the proportion of substitute currency that the rice industry is required to accept. As a result, because the plan had already been decided, it could not be changed, and they dispersed without success. It is rumored that Zhu Ziyu, chairman of the Rice Industry Association, avoided this by going elsewhere, leading to the surveillance of directors Wu Zijing, Shen Qinpu, Fang Songping, and others.

Kunshan

Arrest of Swindling Impersonator

The county government recently uncovered a case of forging seals and swindling. Li Enqing came here three months ago and established the "Guohua Factory," falsely claiming to inspect ironware on behalf of the Jiangsu-Shanghai District of Jiangsu Province, engaging in swindling. He sold thirty-one baskets of matches sealed by the county government for his own use. The machinery of the Wufeng Rice Mill was also forcibly occupied under the guise of "requisitioning." The authorities discovered this, dispatched a team to arrest Li and others, and found a counterfeit seal of the Jiangsu Provincial Government, as well as a signature stamp of Chairman Wang. This case is now being personally interrogated by County Chief Shen, and it is rumored that he will be sent to the provincial authorities for trial within days.

Changshu

Hanjians' Property Prohibited from Unauthorized Sale

The county government recently issued a notice that the property of 54 Hanjians, including Shen, has been sealed off. Before a verdict is reached in the High Court, all unauthorized sale or collection of rent is prohibited. Anyone who greedily buys or conceals such property will be prosecuted as a receiver of stolen goods.

City and Township Arrest of Hooligans and Vagrants: In order to thoroughly prevent Hanjians from mixing in, the local security authorities have decided to arrest all hooligans, vagrants, and deserters (including those with incomplete uniforms) in the city and townships, and no bail will be allowed.

Wuxi

Commissioner's Office Thoroughly Investigates Cotton Yarn

Cheng Zhongxing, the Jiangsu Provincial Commissioner, recently received a secret report that a case of corruption involving sealed cotton yarn has occurred in this county, causing widespread social discussion. These 131 pieces of cotton yarn were previously sealed by the county government in preparation for price controls. Not only has this not been implemented, but the Xie Shenghe and other yarn shops have colluded with certain individuals to sell it off without authorization. In order to eliminate corruption, Commissioner Cheng has dispatched Zhang Lisan, a special investigator from the commissioner's office, to Wuxi for a thorough investigation, to review all case files and collect evidence. Zhang has already returned to the province to report to Commissioner Cheng for a decision.

Public Courtesan Management Establishes Red-Light District: The county government, in order to manage public courtesans, previously planned to designate Jiucheng Lane on the road as a red-light district. The plan was changed, and three locations, Changkang Lane, Shou Kang Lane, and Ping An Lane, were designated as red-light districts. Residents of these three lanes have been ordered to move out within a time limit. All prostitutes, guide shops, and singing girls, etc., must move in within a time limit. Hereafter, prostitutes, etc., are not allowed to stand on the road and solicit customers at will.

Jiangyin

Jiangyin Establishes Electric Power Center Station

According to sources concerned: The National Defense Funding Committee has decided to set up three electric power center stations in the Jiangnan area in the short term, namely Shanghai, Jiangyin, and Nanjing. It is heard that the committee will send personnel to Chengqing within days to complete the surveying, and construction can then begin. Once completed, the electricity for northern Jiangsu and neighboring counties of Jiangyin will be supplied by these electric power stations.

### Secret Nature of American "Bat" Missile Publicly Revealed - Special Translation by This Newspaper's Translation Department

The U.S. Navy's aircraft-launched radar-guided missile, which was used to hit targets miles away, destroyed many Japanese warships and merchant ships in the final year of the war, the U.S. Navy recently revealed.

This was the first successfully controlled automatic bombing device operated by any country during the war. This closely guarded wartime secret weapon takes its name from the "Bat." Truly, when a bat flies, it emits a rapid series of sound waves, and it relies on the echo of these sound waves to guide itself. The missile's direct approach to the bombing target is also based on the echo of radar to automatically adjust its direction, so it is called the "Bat."

More Powerful than Japanese "Human Torpedoes"

The "Bat" missile's guidance system is far more harmful than its counterpart, the human pilots in Japan's Kamikaze special attack teams. It can see its target under any visibility conditions, and its reaction is also faster. It takes up less space than Japan's human torpedoes, and never "fails." This radar guidance technology is cleverly integrated into the bomb during factory production.

The "Bat" missile is launched by Navy patrol bombers from far outside the defensive anti-aircraft fire net of the target. Once it leaves the mother plane, it becomes completely automatic. Any evasive action by the target ship cannot escape its control. Its high speed and small size simply made Japanese gunners unaware. Each Navy patrol plane carries one "Bat" under each wing.

Rear Admiral Pralaess's First "Wing" team used "Bat" to bomb Japanese naval and ground targets on the Pacific front to great effect.

Examples of Missile Use

For example: Two aircraft simultaneously discovered an enemy ship 20 miles away using radar. They flew closer and identified it as a Japanese destroyer. The ship's anti-aircraft fire was very intense. When the two aircraft flew out of range, the Japanese immediately stopped firing. At that time, one of the aircraft immediately released its "Bat" missile. It quickly descended through the sky and headed straight for the destroyer, instantly destroying its bow. Another destroyer immediately approached to rescue the crew and fired wildly at the mother plane that launched the missile, but the mother plane had already flown out of range.

Using the "Bat" is a fairly simple procedure. The pilot of the mother plane simply finds its target, aims at the ship it wants to attack, and then presses the button to release the missile, and it's done. The released missile will automatically head straight for its target, even if its target is a convoy of fireships. The launching aircraft can still move freely according to the pilot's wishes.

Unaffected by Climate

The missile can be launched in any weather, day or night, but the target must be clearly identified, because its guidance system cannot distinguish between friend and foe.

This radar-guided missile is about 12 feet long, with a wingspan of 10 feet, and is filled with explosives. Its speed is similar to that of an aircraft. Its range is so great that the mother plane can operate freely outside the enemy's maximum anti-aircraft fire net.

Old-fashioned bombing methods often become less accurate as the target distance increases, so the percentage of hits from outside the range of anti-aircraft fire is very small. However, the "Bat's" high accuracy is not affected by distance.

The fact proves that the Japanese never understood the nature of the missile, because it was always accurately targeting the target when the Japanese thought it was out of range. There was no warning from the mother plane beforehand, or if there was, it was very subtle. After the use of this secret weapon was revealed, U.S. Navy Chief of Ordnance Rear Admiral Halsey declared: "Although the principles of its use can be applied to other weapons in the future, it is now considered obsolete and unnecessary."

The Successful Manufacture of the Missile

In 1942, before Japan organized the Kamikaze Special Attack Team or adopted human torpedoes, the U.S. Navy Bureau of Ordnance asked the Scientific Research Society to explore a missile manufacturing program that could find its own target and be automatically controlled by radar. The originator of this plan was Navy Lieutenant Dirk.

The successful manufacture of this complex weapon was the result of close cooperation between many experts. Dr. De La Edeng of the National Bureau of Standards assisted in the technical work. Navy Lieutenant Dirk and Lieutenant Colonel Taibo integrated the military aspects of the work. The radar guidance system was the result of cooperation between experts from the following units: Scientists at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Cambridge Institute of Technology under the direction of Drs. Staite and Lam, scientists at the Green Zao Electrotechnical Laboratory under the direction of Yuan, Dr. Aite and Dr. Cla of the Quantitative Bureau engaged in research on gas dynamics and stability. Navy Major McClaughlin of the Bureau of Aeronautics supervised the flight tests.

### An American Envoy with a Strong Sense of Democracy - Anecdotes of Marshall - Translated from an American Magazine, Volume 5, Issue 1

In the summer of 1941, one afternoon, the U.S. military was conducting a field exercise. An artillery company commander found an ideal field artillery position under a large tree. However, in order to set up the artillery position, two branches of the tree in front of the artillery had to be sawed off, and the military headquarters had a ban on damaging civilian property without the owner's permission. As a result, the artillery company commander had no choice but to first obtain the owner's consent, which delayed the time for setting up the artillery position by several hours.

Soon after, a journalist who witnessed this exercise was granted an interview with General Marshall, the Chief of Staff of the U.S. Army. During the interview, the journalist mentioned this incident and asked him: "Why don't the troops temporarily ignore all necessary losses and carry on quickly, and compensate the owner for the losses afterwards? If the troops have to consider the farmer's trees, how can the U.S. military fight?"

Marshall looked at the journalist with a kind and friendly gaze, and said, "That kind of thing would be of great help to rapid military action." and said, "There is no doubt that the military would do that entirely." But he also said, "The United States is a democracy, and therefore the people have certain legal rights. In any case, the U.S. military should support these rights and avoid harming the interests of the people." Marshall felt that the brief delay in the exercise was a small price to pay for upholding the great principles of the founding of the United States.

Those who know General Marshall well know that the secret of his success does not lie in military talent. Although he is rich in military talent, his success lies in his genuine sense of democracy.

### In the History of International Friendship and Cooperation - A British Exemplary Reporter - Laid the Foundation for the Chinese Industrial Cooperatives Movement - Translated from the North China Daily News, this month's 23rd

Under the Qilian Mountains, covered in snow in Gansu Province, there is a small city called "Santan" (transliteration). Just outside the south gate of Santan, at the foot of the mountain, lies a pile of brick-built green tombs, inside which lies a British man named Olwyn Hogge. He will never be forgotten by the Chinese people. He is the protagonist of this article.

China has many foreign friends, but none who can penetrate into the lives of the people like him. He can speak Chinese, he suffers and works with the Chinese people, and he is treated like one of their own.

Mr. Hogg's Arrival in China

He came to China in 1937, not long after the Sino-Japanese Incident. At that time, he was a special correspondent for the British Information Office. In October 1938, Hankou fell, and he stayed in the occupied area, later going to Peiping to observe the so-called "East Asian New Order." After that, he left Peiping with a group of students and lingered in the southwestern guerrilla areas for a year. From then on, he had a deeper understanding of the Chinese people. He could speak Chinese, sing patriotic songs, and sing choruses like the locals.

He heard that the Chinese Industrial Cooperatives were running successfully, so he began to travel again, wanting to find some work to do. It took him eight months and more than 600 kilometers of travel to finally reach Baoji. He lived in a thatched cottage in Shaanxi for a long time and then contracted typhoid fever.

Going to Baoji County to Start Industrial Cooperation

Baoji is the headquarters of the Chinese Industrial Cooperatives in the Northwest. The cooperative movement in many provinces of China has flourished from there. There, he saw the work of the society, industry, hospitals, and schools.

The principles of "military first," "victory first," and "economic construction must be adapted to the needs of the country" have all been put into practice. Refugees are living under new living methods, and they are all supporting themselves by working, because they also have a share in supplying the needs of the army and the people, so they are also doing their part in the war of resistance. Hogg became extraordinarily enthusiastic there.

He did not go to Chongqing to look for work, and under the introduction of Professor Lapu Wute, he became the first British secretary of the branch. He worked very hard, often traveling to the cooperative centers, writing reports, and describing the success of the workers in overcoming difficulties. During this brave tenure with the Chinese Industrial Cooperatives, he provided first-class news and propaganda materials to overseas news agencies.

Founding a Technical College to Train Technical Personnel

He gradually became interested in the work of the Bailey Technical College. Children in the technical college are being trained as technical personnel for various industrial cooperatives. In 1942, he taught at the Shuangshipo Bailey Technical College. As a graduate of Oxford University, he was more than qualified and experienced in teaching.

At Bailey Technical College, students and faculty consciously worked together towards a new revolutionary educational goal. The children of laborers or farmers receive specialized education there, all based on the practical work of emphasizing both academic studies and technology.

Faculty and students live together, and they do what the students do. In this way, team spirit and loyalty are cultivated successfully. In order to implement autonomous discipline, students have group organizations, and in order to encourage "competition," there are awards for simple basic virtues such as cleanliness, punctuality, and obedience. Hogg loved this kind of life very much. He worked tirelessly for the welfare of the children. He began to understand their background and their various problems, so the children regarded him as a good friend. He eventually became their principal.

Crossing Qingling Mountain and Running 100 Kilometers

In 1942, when he first became the head of the school, he encountered many setbacks. It was not easy to recruit suitable faculty. It takes considerable time to make the older children develop a genuine sense of responsibility. But he never gave up, and he worked even harder than before. Finally achieved the purpose of prestige. In the summer, in order to participate in the cooperative day held in "Dacheng," he led the entire school across Qingling Mountain, walking a distance of one hundred kilometers. This move increased the knowledge of many children in the countryside, because there were many children who were taking the train for the first time.

When this group returned to the foot of Shuangshipo Mountain and saw the school gate from a distance, the constant cheers made Hogg discover the dawn of his success for the first time. This proves the students' pride and love for their alma mater. Under his leadership, the school became more and more developed day by day. He organized labor teams, built roads, built bridges, and completed a Dalle Square. New houses were also built, and tens of thousands of bricks and tiles were all transported by the students, and these tasks were all completed in their spare time.

Forced to Move the School, Died of Tetanus

When the Japanese army advanced towards Shaanxi, the school decided to retreat to Santan. Hogg expressed doubts about whether this relocation was appropriate, but he still dealt with the situation at the time with his usual determination and hope. When he arrived in Santan, he established a new campus in a record-breaking short time. He was also planning summer work and sports programs. After that, he thought of running to Lanzhou to bring back several important personnel, but unfortunately this plan was not successful. During the relocation of the school, he accidentally injured his foot, which turned into tetanus. People were looking everywhere for serum that could treat tetanus in the radio and in telegrams, but it was too late. Hogg finally passed away on July 22, 1945.

Sixteen students supported his coffin, which was covered with a large school flag made by the students themselves, on which were written the names of all the students, in order to commemorate "their beloved teacher." After the funeral, a child asked, "Which direction is England in"? After inquiring clearly, he decided to pay his respects to his teacher's parents.

A Concluding Statement, Leaving a Lasting Reputation

We express our deepest regret for this British man who lived with the Chinese people. His death was a major loss to the Chinese Industrial Cooperatives. On a small piece of paper, he wrote his last few words: "Everything I have is given to the Bailey School." He did not see victory and liberation in his lifetime, but the work he did in the dark days of the Chinese people will live forever in the post-war construction era. We will always remember Hogg, he is a perfect example of international friendship and cooperation. (Translated by This Newspaper's Translation Department)

Enthusiastically Welcoming Allied Friends

(Left picture) When the First Division of the U.S. Marine Corps entered the Tanggu coast, the local people enthusiastically welcomed them and held a "Gaoxiao" performance to welcome the allies. This kind of "Gaoxiao" performance, which is similar to dancing, is usually only held during the New Year. The one wearing a steel helmet in the left corner is an American soldier. The Sino-American flags complement each other, fully demonstrating the enthusiasm of Sino-American cooperation.

The Capital Celebrates Christmas Eve

General Wedemeyer, Commander-in-Chief of the U.S. Military in the China Theater, spent Christmas Eve in Beijing with Commander-in-Chief Ying Qin on the 24th. The host of the banquet was Mr. He. In addition to Mr. Wedemeyer, Colonel Starr and other senior officials were invited to participate. More than 30 people from our side were invited, including Commander-in-Chief Chen Shaokuan.

### Marshal Ma in the Capital: An Unprecedented Scene of Receiving a State Guest

— From a Common Man in Chongqing

For the past eight years, under the same battle line of anti-aggression and anti-imperialism, the traditional foundation of Sino-American friendship has been further expanded and consolidated. It is no wonder that when US Special Envoy Marshal George Marshall flew to the capital, those who rushed to the Baili Airfield, far from the mountain city, to welcome him included not only government military and political representatives, but also representatives from all walks of life, as well as Marshal Ma's colleagues. The total number of welcomers on the scene was no less than a thousand. The solemnity of the ceremony and the outpouring of warm feelings truly represent an unprecedented scene of welcoming a state guest.

Silver Giant Machine Breaks Through Floating Air

At 12:15 PM, a silver giant machine broke through the floating clouds and flew towards the city airspace. This was an opportunity to present our war-resistant holy city's heroic appearance to the state guest as he arrived in the air. China, in such a mountainous and inaccessible environment, is able to resist violence without yielding, which is the result of the wise decisions of our great leader.

After the plane circled the city three times, it turned and flew towards the airfield, instantly making the quiet air tense and serious. Under their skilled techniques, the American military police used ropes to create a perimeter. Secretary-General Wang Chonghui, wearing thick, near-sighted glasses, dressed in a blue mandarin jacket, was mistaken for a rustic old man by the American military police, who prepared to take him away. Fortunately, someone nearby noticed and explained, and he was finally allowed to enter the rope circle.

The Sound of Cameras Like Machine Gun Practice

At 12:25 PM, the giant C45 aircraft landed safely. Special Envoy Marshall emerged from the belly of the machine. Chinese and foreign reporters were given priority and rushed to take photos. The sound of cameras went off constantly, like machine gun practice. Major General Landahl, nimble in stature, was the first to step forward to pay his respects. Premier Song Ziwen then stepped forward to shake hands and exchange greetings. The band began to play the national anthems of the United States and China. Marshal Ma stood at attention to show his respect and was then introduced to the welcoming personnel by Premier Song. Marshal Ma shook hands with each of them to express his thanks.

The Crowd at the Airfield Moves with Marshal Ma

Marshal Ma is quite tall, with a ruddy complexion, a solemn demeanor, and full of energy. He did not appear to have been traveling. He wore purple leather shoes, held tan gloves, and wore a beige overcoat with five silver stars on his shoulders. At first glance, one can tell that he is a great military man—the Chief of Staff who planned and made decisions during the war and achieved great feats.

When he reviewed the guard of honor, he smiled and walked up to the captain, shook his hand, and expressed his satisfaction. Then, the human wave at the airfield also moved with Marshal Ma's steps. Marshal Ma remained silent throughout, unwilling to make any statements. This fully demonstrated the silent personality of this state guest who carries a heavy responsibility.

Large Sedan With a Five-Star Marshal's Flag

Finally, he stood in the same spot with Major General Landahl, gazing at the scenery of the airfield. This moment of gazing may have unfolded a picture of the current situation and future of great China in his heart. Our country must be unified and strengthened from a state of division. Premier Song, the chief of the state guest's reception, greeted Marshal Ma and boarded the large sedan with a five-star marshal's flag, and drove towards the city.

The welcoming personnel watched this state guest leave the airfield, and everyone discussed the state guest's mission. Some said: Marshal Ma is the only marshal below Pershing in the United States, so his mission to China will surely have a satisfactory outcome for China's future. Some said: Today, the Communist Party also had representatives at the scene to welcome him, which is a gratifying phenomenon. Some also said with emotion: If a family has a rebellious son who ruins the family reputation, it is a shameful thing to have neighbors persuade him. On my way home, I was immersed in their various discussions.

Editorial

### Our Country Elected Cardinal

Yesterday, a Rome dispatch stated that the Pope newly appointed 30 cardinals, including Chinese Bishop Tian Gengxin, who was also newly elected. This is an unprecedented event in the history of the Catholic Church. The news arrived just as the whole country was celebrating Christmas, and people in general, whether Catholic believers or not, felt gratified. A cardinal, known in the West as Cardinal, is popularly known in our country as a "red-robed archbishop." Apart from the Pope, it is the highest honorary position in the Catholic Church. The organization of the Catholic Church takes Rome as the old place of the Apostle Peter's hermitage. Therefore, Rome is the Pope and Bishop of Rome. Dioceses are established in various places, each with a bishop in charge of diocesan affairs. Several dioceses are gathered to form a religious provincial area, with an archbishop as the chairman of each provincial area. In places where church affairs are not yet developed, apostolic prefectures or apostolic vicariates are established, and apostolic prefects or vicars are sent to manage missionary affairs. Those who have been awarded the title of bishop are also called bishops. Those who manage Catholic affairs in various places are these bishops. Below the bishop are countless Catholic priests and believers; above the bishop is the Vatican in Rome, the Pope in Rome (commonly known as the Pope).

The Pope is the spiritual leader of 400 million Catholic believers worldwide. In order to handle church affairs worldwide, he needs the assistance of experienced and virtuous people for his consultation, so the College of Cardinals is established, with 70 cardinals. The reason why they are called cardinals is mainly because they participate in the secrets of the Catholic Church's center. The status of these cardinals, next to the Pope, is the most solemn. When the Pope is vacant, the supreme power to elect the Pope is in the hands of the 70 cardinals in the College of Cardinals. Outside the College of Cardinals and below the Pope, there are 11 departments to handle church affairs worldwide. Among them, the heads of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, the Congregation for Bishops, and the Congregation for the Oriental Churches are concurrently held by the Pope, while the heads of the Congregation for the Evangelization of Peoples and the Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments are held by cardinals. From all this, it can be seen that the position of cardinal is very solemn. If compared with our country's government organization, its position is somewhat like that of a member of the National Government. Now that the Pope has appointed Bishop Tian Gengxin as a cardinal, he is truly the first person from our country to participate in the secrets of the Catholic Church's center. After hearing this news, we cannot help but have a few thoughts:

First, the Pope's appointment of Bishop Tian Gengxin as a cardinal shows how concerned the Pope is about church affairs in China. Catholicism came to China during the late Ming Dynasty and has been spreading in China for more than 300 years. Unfortunately, due to the Qing Dynasty's ban on religion, when the powers signed unequal treaties with us, freedom of religion was also included as a clause. Since then, Catholicism's missionary work in China has been based on unequal treaties, and many Chinese people have regarded it as a "foreign religion." Now that the unequal treaties have been abolished, freedom of religion no longer needs to rely on treaties for protection, and freedom of belief has been clearly stipulated in national law. The Father of the Nation, Sun Yat-sen, was a Christian believer, and the current government, from Chairman Chiang Kai-shek onwards, also has many devout Christians who are extremely concerned about maintaining the missionary work of Christianity. It is said that in recent years, Catholic church affairs have gradually developed, with more than 130 dioceses, including more than 30 Chinese bishops and 4.5 million believers, which cannot be said to have a wide impact. However, compared with China's population, the number is actually still limited. Now that the Pope is extremely concerned about church affairs in China, and our government is also extremely supportive of Christian missionary work, we sincerely hope that Catholicism can continue to develop in our country so that China can gradually become a country with an increasing number of Christian believers, living up to the Pope's and our Chairman's expectations.

Second, Catholicism has more than 400 million believers worldwide, and there are certainly good and bad people among them. But these 400 million people are certainly not all ignorant and ignorant. Among them are many outstanding scientists, writers, and even politicians. Its ability to gain the belief of so many people certainly has profound meaning. Chinese customs, especially scholars and officials, have never attached importance to religion. Some people even regard religion as poison, and therefore often ignore Christianity—especially the mainstay of Christianity, Catholicism. But we cannot ignore one fact: that the world today can almost be said to be the Christian world, Western civilization is Christian civilization, and we really need to pay more attention to studying Christianity. China is still not a Christian country, and the percentage of Christian believers in the population of Shanghai is not high. However, Shanghai is celebrating its first happy Christmas after victory, and people of all ages, both men and women, have a passionate feeling. We hope that everyone will use the same mood to study the truth of Christianity enthusiastically.

Third, Christian believers cannot abandon their responsibility to China. Although the percentage of Christian believers in China's total population is not high, they have a great responsibility for China's nation-building. They should understand what obstacles are standing in the way of nation-building, and how they should exert and use their power to clear or reduce these obstacles. On the positive side, they should consider how to make the religion they worship acceptable and integrated by the Chinese people, just like Xu Guangqi, the respected elder of Shanghai in the late Ming Dynasty, achieved some success, and how to promote new trends in order to promote the psychological construction, ethical construction, and even social construction, political construction, and economic construction in the arduous work of nation-building. The spirit of Christianity is worldly and combative, and it should be used to assist in the work of nation-building.

Judging from Bishop Tian Gengxin's election as a cardinal, it can be seen that the Catholic Church in China has gradually reached adulthood. We will not forget the good influence of the spread of Catholicism on our country's culture in the late Ming and early Qing dynasties. We sincerely hope that from now on, Chinese Catholic believers will follow the instructions of the Pope of Rome in his Christmas message, and with the spirit of cooperation, goodwill, and mutual trust, they can make outstanding contributions to the work of building a new China and a new world, so that the world that the Pope calls "post-war" but still without "peace" will surely enter a day of true peace.

### Bullish Investors in the Gold Market Unload, Trend Fluctuates, US Dollar Falls Back Sixty Yuan

Yesterday, the listed price of gold in the capital was changed to 80,000 to buy and 80,010 to sell. In addition, the Tianjin price was reported to be small, and people felt disappointed again. Bullish investors at the customs front rushed to unload. Newspaper reports speculated a lot about the new exchange rate. The market opened in the morning and broke into the 800,000 mark. Many retail investors struggled to maintain their positions at lower prices, advancing and retreating around 780,000. However, large paper industry investors still came to cut their positions at noon, and finally the market could not hold on. Securities firms also followed the trend and sold off, dropping to 766,000. In the afternoon, the situation gradually stabilized. As a result, the price fell back 33,000 compared with the previous closing price. Gold jewelry was listed at 83,000, fine silver at 600 yuan, and silver dollars still stood at around 450. The informal interest rate continued to be mediocre, ranging from about 8% to 10%. In general, the psychology was forced by the reduced listed buying price in the capital, plus a 92% discount on the exchange rate, and the interest in gold gradually dimmed again. The trend is still fluctuating.

The US dollar was affected by the small decline in the gold market. Reports speculated that the new exchange rate against the US dollar would suddenly be 1,300. Retail investors rushed to close their positions, and the price fell rapidly from 1,350 yuan. The selling pressure only stopped slightly when it retreated to below 1,310 yuan. Yarn mills continued to aggressively close their positions, and the situation improved slightly after that. In the afternoon, the price fluctuated around 1,320 yuan. As a result, it fell back 60 yuan compared with the previous close. Hong Kong dollars were flat for old goods, while new goods fell by 2 yuan. There were not many transactions. Australian pounds were still around 2.5 US dollars, and British pounds were around 3.5 US dollars. However, rupees from Calcutta were traded at about 29 cents to the US dollar due to the sympathy of Indian people, and the price rose slightly.

### Large Investors Buy at Low Prices, Bond Market is Firm, Foreign Stocks Fall Across the Board

Although the public debt market opened flat, news reports of Sun Ke caused people to be shaken again. Class C bonds gradually recovered to a high price of 735 yuan. Later, due to the weakness of the gold market, there were many investors who unloaded at high prices, and the price once again retreated to the 700 yuan mark. However, large investors in the industry were purchasing bonds after unloading gold. At noon, the price was still stable at around 710 yuan. As a result, it rose by 15 yuan to 65 yuan compared with the previous closing price. Miscellaneous brands did not keep up, and the price difference gradually widened.

Chinese stocks were stable yesterday after being weak. After large investors in the industry unloaded gold, their surplus funds came to support the market again. At the noon close, there was a sudden appearance of more demand than supply. The market opened flat. Due to the decline in the gold market, many investors closed their positions. Yarn mills fell to 660 yuan, China Asia retreated to 660 yuan, and Qinxing broke into the 30 yuan mark. The market came to the rescue at six households and was pulled up at noon. However, the three small hot stocks did not keep up due to time constraints. As a result, yarn mills and US Asia were flat compared with the previous closing price, while the three small hot stocks fell by 2 yuan to 3.5 yuan. There were people searching for unpopular old stocks. The situation is still firm.

Foreign stocks rose for several consecutive days, and there was supply at high prices. The gold market fell, and the problem of transfer of ownership was still not resolved. Although some companies could deal with stamps, people were still not satisfied. As a result, Jardine fell back more than 200 yuan, Jardine Brewery 30 yuan, paper industry 40 yuan, and each unpopular stock gradually showed more supply than demand.

### Grain Prices Rise, Northern Sales are Active

The rice market has northern sales in the interior, causing production prices to rise. There are still many southern Japonica rice arrivals in Shanghai, and the market situation is stable. Indica rice is scarce and prices are firm. Flour sales to the north continue, rising another 100 to 200 yuan. Soybean sales to Fujian have slowed down, and prices have risen by 100 to 200 yuan. Raw peanuts are sold as soon as they arrive, increasing the killing rate. The oil market has temporarily stopped in Ningbo, and the other chemical products are still sluggish, falling by several hundred yuan. Vegetable oil is dull, more than 1,000 yuan. Soybean cake has some transactions in Shantou, and the market is flat. Wine sales have turned bullish, and prices continue to rise by 500 yuan.

### Coal Prices Rise Again, Coal Dust Transactions are Sparse

The white coal market is diverging. White coal lump stove coal users are selling very well, and the industry's absorption is strong, and the rising trend is reignited. White coal seams have seen a sharp decline in sales and transactions have gradually become sparse since the coal briquette factory stopped purchasing. Market prices continue to decline. White coal cubs have active sales channels and are still outstanding. Bituminous coal trends are still stable, but factory sales are still sluggish.

### Yarn Market is Stable, Inland Demand is Strong

Yesterday, the yarn market started weak and ended firm. The price was not much different from the previous closing price. In the morning, due to the large number of dealers selling, 16-count Guangming once fell to 395,000 yuan. However, because the inland buyers' absorption was strong, the price gradually rose to 415,000 yuan. The closing price of 20-count yarn was also very stable. Fine yarn and double-strand yarn rose by 10,000 to 20,000 yuan because cloth factories were searching for them. If the factory owners do not release a large amount of goods for the time being, the current supply and demand situation in the market has entered a state of equilibrium.

### Tinplate Sells Well, Can Manufacturers Use it as Kerosene

Since last month, the Asia Petroleum Company has a large number of barrelled kerosene arriving in Shanghai. Therefore, they ordered a huge amount of kerosene cans from various can manufacturers, so the sales of 112-pound tinplate are very strong, and the price has also risen by about 20%.

### Summary of Business Conditions

Although there are many local weaving factories in the coarse cloth market, sales from Beijing and Shanghai have come to Shanghai to purchase in large quantities, and the cloth market has been slightly affected by this.

Walnuts have Tianjin ships arriving at the port, and delivery is imminent. The quantity is considerable, and the impact on sales is not small. Peanuts have low-grade goods arriving, and sales are also rare, and transactions are sparse.

The Hankou dealers of dyes purchase in tons, especially sulfide dyes, so the market price has risen sharply.

The silk market is down due to the decline in the gold market. Sellers are watching, and although there are many searchers, transactions are flat, and prices are stable. Zhili gan silk has risen by 50,000 yuan, because silk factories are interested in purchasing.

The tea market is still strong, but the sellers do not want to sell easily because there is not much stock in the market, so the market atmosphere is firm.

Yesterday, the cigarette market was flat due to the gold market. Japan, Great East, Southeast, Yuhua and other cigarette companies had shipments to supply, so the buying momentum was dull and the market was soft. However, Lao Dao and Fairy cigarettes are still stable.

### Economic Briefs

The Qingdao branches of the Bank of China, the Central Bank, the Bank of Communications, the Agricultural Bank of China, and the China Trust and Postal Savings Bureau are scheduled to be established next year.

In addition, the Association and the Coal Association have successively applied to sell a portion of the remaining coal at a fair price. The Fuel Management Committee has approved it and instructed them to jointly establish the "People's Livelihood Coal Management Office" to handle it together. The Association is currently actively preparing to establish it and will hold a meeting to establish it in the coming days.

### At the Reception for the Special Envoys, Industry and Commerce Express Their Pain, Hoping to be Exempt from This Year's Income Tax

(Report from this newspaper) More than 190 units of industrial and commercial trade associations in this city, initiated by the Chamber of Commerce, jointly hosted the special envoys Ye and Niu (Special Envoy Qi abandoned due to illness), Deputy Minister Hong of the Ministry of Social Affairs, Inspector Cheng, and Director Wu of the Party Department, Special Commissioner Lu of the Ministry of Social Affairs, and other officials at Kang Le Restaurant at 3 PM yesterday. The officials praised the efforts of Shanghai industry and commerce in the eight years of the War of Resistance, and gave guidance on how to strengthen the organization of trade associations, how labor and management should cooperate, and how various groups should study and provide opinions on the government's current laws and regulations. Wang of the Silk Mill Trade Association, Pan Shihao of the Machinery Dyeing and Weaving Industry and the Cotton Cloth Industry, and Jin Runxiang of the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce all expressed their pain regarding their respective industries. Mr. Pan said that more than 3 million bolts of cotton cloth and more than 10,000 pieces of yarn that were forcibly taken away by the enemy puppets but not disposed of should be investigated and returned. He also said that the government should be flexible in handling the income tax problem caused by the conversion of the book capital amount of the city's industry and commerce, and not tax real money based on empty books. Mr. Jin also said that most industries are actually losing money, and advocated exempting income tax for the 34th year. This was unanimously supported by the entire group, and Mr. (blank) , the person in charge of the Chamber of Commerce and the special transport guide of the Ministry of Social Affairs, accepted it on behalf of the officials and conveyed it to the central government. Mr. (blank) also gave guidance on the reorganization of various trade associations, saying that those who have participated in the puppet association, if there are no other active behaviors to help the enemy and puppets to harm industry and commerce and the people, if they are still elected by the industry, they can be elected. He hopes that the various associations will no longer wait and see, and organize and establish themselves as soon as possible.

### Franc Officially Devalued

The French government officially announced yesterday that the new exchange rate of the franc is set at 480 francs to one British pound and 119.1 francs to one US dollar. According to the original exchange rate, it was 200 francs to one British pound, and the current value is only one-tenth of that in 1928.

### Yarn and Cloth Merchants Investigate Old Warehouse Receipts

Association Handles Registration

(Report from this newspaper) A considerable number of the warehouse receipts issued by yarn and cloth manufacturers in this city when the enemy puppets forcibly purchased yarn and cloth in August of the 32nd year are still in the hands of the receipt holders. They are divided into two parts, one is foreign merchants, such as Jardine Matheson, (blank) Chang, etc., and the other is Chinese merchants, such as China Textile, Tongyi, etc. The warehouse receipts issued by these manufacturers are usually circulated as bargaining chips without actual goods. There are also long-term warehouse receipts issued, waiting for the raw materials to be gradually replenished, and goods are distributed to the shareholders in batches. At that time, after the enemy puppets robbed them, the factory's inventory was forcibly purchased by them. Those who held receipts and were unwilling to do so did not go through the so-called application for sale procedures, nor did they receive the payment. Then, the warehouse receipts were naturally still in the hands of the original owners. And the manufacturers who issued empty warehouse receipts had no goods to apply for sale at all, and did not notify the receipt holders one by one. Therefore, the total number of warehouse receipts issued at that time was difficult to match the total number of existing goods. Since the victory came, the enemy puppets surrendered, and the goods in the Jardine Matheson Lun Chang factory were already empty. However, the Cotton Cloth Association found that a part of the goods were confiscated by the enemy puppets and existed in Shanghai, intact. The Association has claimed rights against Jardine Matheson Lun Chang and others, and has reported it to the Enemy Puppet Property Processing Bureau, requesting its return. It is now setting up a special office in the Association to solicit receipt holders to issue receipts in preparation for future apportionment. As for the insufficient part, they will also demand compensation from the warehouse receipt issuing factory. As for the Zhongfang, Tongyi and other Chinese factories, their receipt holders are also asking the Association to organize registration and apply for the factory to distribute goods in groups. The Reorganization Committee of the Association revealed that the factory owners who issued empty warehouse receipts did not allow (blank) to take the opportunity to purchase yarn and cloth from the enemy puppets, and confused them. They expressed that they will be held accountable according to law.

### Chenyou Cup Basketball Tournament: Xie Xing Defeats Liangxi Hualian, and Hualian Defeats Chenyou

The Chenyou Cup basketball league held two very exciting Group A matches yesterday afternoon. The air in the basketball hall was particularly lively. The Chenyou Cup is a great success before the open league. Here is a brief description of yesterday's battle:

The opening game was between Xie Xing and Liangxi. The two teams have equal reputations and were one of the most popular matches of the day. Unexpectedly, Liangxi's Yang Yuanlong and Yu Xunzi were absent, and Zhang Jinxuan played with illness, which inevitably weakened their strength. The referees Di Xianzhang and Xuan Hegao, Xie Xing's Liu Fushan scored first, and Chen Xuechong immediately returned the favor. Xie Xing continued to work hard, and Huang Quanlie once again took the lead. However, Liangxi was determined to fight to the death, and their desperate effort produced unexpected results. Chen Xuechong's shots were all accurate, so the score was very close, and the situation was very tense. In the first half, Xie Xing scored 17 points, and Liangxi scored 14 points, a difference of three points. In the second half, Xie Xing adopted a rotational strategy, frequently substituting players. Liangxi took advantage of their unstable formation and continued to press hard, catching up to 26 to 22. Xie Xing then used their ideal lineup, and once again took the lead. In the end, they defeated Liangxi with a score of 37 to 24, giving them hope of winning the third place.

The second game was between the victorious team Hualian and Chenyou. The outcome was expected. At the beginning of the game, Chenyou's Yao Wenyu and Liang Yongjia scored frequently, taking a 5 to 2 lead in an instant. This was the golden age of Chenyou yesterday. Afterwards, Hualian's Kong Guangyi and Wu Chengzhang scored, and Chenyou had no chance to raise their heads. In the first half, Hualian was ahead with a score of 13 to 5. After the break, they changed sides and fought again. Hualian played even better, and Chenyou declined rapidly. In a short time, Hualian took an absolute advantage with a score of 23 to 5. Hualian then made major adjustments to their reinforcements, and their momentum was still strong. Chenyou's soldiers had no fighting spirit. At the end of the game, Hualian won with a score of 42 to 17, maintaining their great record of six wins in six games.

Also, the schedule for the four Group B matches today is recorded below:

Vulture Team vs. Comet (Cup Division) 5:30 pm

Chen Huang vs. South China (Cup Division) 6:15 pm

Chen Hong vs. Youai (Chen Division) 7:00 pm

Shan Team vs. Xingzhong (You Division) 7:45 pm

### Education and Remuneration

— Jin Guang

If everyone cannot deny that teachers also need to eat and support their families, then what is the reason for the particularly low and humble treatment of teachers?

I recently applied for a teaching position and succeeded smoothly in the discussion. The job is to teach Chinese in the first year of junior high school, and Chinese, history, and nature in the sixth grade of primary school, for a total of 1,100 minutes of class per week, which is 22 class periods. That is to say, I have to shout in the classroom for four hours every day. The salary is 500,000 puppet currency per month, with one free lunch. The location is at ×× Primary and Secondary School on Haige Road. I also asked about the number of students in the school. I was told that there are 46 students in the first year of junior high school and 39 students in the sixth grade. Frankly speaking, I already know that it will take me at least two or three hours every day to grade the papers and essays of these two classes at the fastest speed. Then, it is very obvious that my entire day is completely given to this school.

To put it bluntly, my daily time is sold for 500,000 puppet currency (and I have to deduct 20% for the streetcar fee for work, so it can only be said to be 400,000) and one lunch. Disregarding the lives of all my family members, can I only use 500,000 puppet currency to feed me for the other two meals? — It is so embarrassing to say this, the lowest-priced meal in a small restaurant in the city now costs 150 legal currency (plus a tip), which costs 4,500 legal currency per month, which is 900,000 puppet currency! But let's just say that we always need to be humble when eating at a small restaurant, and it's always cheaper to cook at home, and cut this number in half, which is still 450,000. Then how will the remaining 50,000 puppet currency be used to allocate thirty breakfasts?

Yesterday, I happened to meet a student who was already working as a clerk in a small shop. I asked him about his recent work, and finally asked about his salary. The answer on the salary side was that the store provided three meals a day, and the salary was 15,000 legal currency per month — I couldn't help but shout out loud; is this my shame, or the shame of those who proudly bear the title of educator?

This time I am planning to change my direction of survival — I can tell you all that I have spent five years in the teaching profession — this is less about my lack of integrity, and more about the inevitable consequence of being destroyed by the unreasonable treatment of education!

Moreover, I no longer want to be exploited layer by layer by those "hypocritical" "educators." The school's fees are not low!

### President Song Determined to Investigate Illegal Reception of Enemy Property: Soldiers Occupying Ship Already Legally Handled

(Report from this newspaper) President Song's visit to Shanghai is purely to review the general enemy and puppet properties received in this city and their handling. He attaches even greater importance to the various illegal incidents that occurred during the reception of certain received warehouses or during the reception itself, and is taking detailed reports from all relevant parties before conducting a thorough investigation. Mr. Song's stay in Shanghai is very brief. He will fly to Tianjin, Beijing and Qingdao in a day or two to inspect.

Continued Meetings with Military Leaders

At 9:00 a.m. yesterday, President Song met with Mayor Qian, Deputy Mayor He Dekui, City Government Secretary-General Shen Shijing, Director Dai Li of the Sino-American Cooperative Organization, Deputy Minister of Social Affairs Hong Lanyou, Zhang Xuezhong of the Third War Zone, and Wang Xiaolai, Chairman of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, at the Shanghai Office of the Executive Yuan. After the officials gathered, the military and government leaders' meeting, centered on President Song, immediately began and did not disperse until 1:00 p.m. According to related sources, the main topic of the meeting was to thoroughly review the work of receiving properties in Shanghai. The city's reconstruction and the relief of unemployed workers were also discussed. According to those close to Mr. Song, Mr. Song's visit was to inspect the current situation in Shanghai, with particular emphasis on the reception of properties. All illegal actions will be thoroughly investigated. At 4:00 p.m., he also met with Xu Xueyu, General Manager of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company. Mr. Xu presented a detailed report on the reception of enemy and puppet ships and the recent handling situation for review. It was also learned that when the Bureau took over the enemy properties "Sanfeng Maru" and "Qiandao Maru", it was forcibly occupied by mixed troops, and even secretly sailed to the fish market, intending to escape. After Mr. Song received the report in Chongqing, he telegraphed the Songhu Garrison Headquarters to send troops on the 18th of this month to arrest the illegal military officer Li Xiangting and five others, who are currently detained in the detention center of the headquarters, awaiting legal proceedings.

According to Mr. Xu Shiping, a counselor of the Executive Yuan, as of now, about 1,200 important personnel from various departments of the Executive Yuan have arrived in the capital using China National Aviation Corporation's special planes and ships. It is expected that the National Government will be able to return to the capital as scheduled next year.

More Than 100 Manufacturers Request Return of Properties

More than 100 manufacturers in this city, including the Da Zhong Dyeing Factory and the Minxing Paper Mill, were occupied and forced to cooperate by the enemy and puppet forces during the War of Resistance. Now that the mountains and rivers have been restored, they have requested the Enemy and Puppet Property Handling Bureau to return the properties to facilitate their early resumption of work. However, the Bureau rejected the request, stating that the central government has explicitly stipulated that "all properties that have been acquired by Japanese and puppet forces, whether forced or not, belong to the central government." After receiving the instructions, the manufacturers convened an emergency meeting and decided to appeal to the two envoy offices of Ye and Niu, who were visiting Shanghai from the central government, and to submit requests to the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Economic Affairs, and the Shanghai Municipal Government for early return. Representatives were also sent to President Song to make a statement.

### New Life Movement Promotion: Departing in Ten Groups

The expanded promotion week organized by the Shanghai New Life Movement Promotion Association is in its third day today. The association's promoters will form ten groups of five people each. Five groups will be responsible for the promotion work in the suburbs from Fanhuangdu, Yihua Town, Xujiahui to Longhua Town, and the other five groups will be responsible for the promotion work in the west of Shanghai, from the Racecourse in the east to Caojiadu in the west, and from Fuxu Road in the south to the Suzhou River in the north. The promotion content focuses on advocating the militarization, artisticization, and productionization of life, and restoring the inherent morals of courtesy, justice, integrity, and shame, and encourages all sectors to practice thrift, punctuality, tidiness, and cleanliness. In addition to lectures, each group of promoters will bring various New Life Movement slogans and pictures, and hold entertainment programs to achieve good results. The association has also scheduled Deputy Mayor He to broadcast a speech on the Youth Radio today, entitled "The New Life of Shanghai Citizens."

### Municipal Party Headquarters Proposes Renaming Major Roads to Roosevelt Road

The Shanghai Municipal Party Headquarters suggested to the Municipal Government to rename one of the city's major thoroughfares to Roosevelt Road to commemorate the "Friend of China." The support of the allied United States was indispensable in the war against Japan. Mr. Roosevelt has always cared for our country, and the government and the public unanimously admire him. This is completely different from the motivation of using foreign names for roads during the old concession era.

### Dalian Municipal Government Personnel Flew to Beiping Yesterday Morning

Shen Yi, the mayor of the Dalian Municipal Government, recently received a telegram from Beiping summoning the main employees remaining in Shanghai to go to Beiping immediately to prepare for the reception work in Dalian within days.

### Shipowners Association Drafts Opinions on Shipping Rehabilitation Measures, Striving for Sound and Rational Shipping

[Our Newspaper] Since the War of Resistance, shipping on the lower reaches of the Yangtze River and along the coast has completely stalled. Most shipping organizations have relocated to the rear, and many ships supplying military transport have been bombed and destroyed by the enemy. Before victory, shipping companies in the rear, such as the state-owned China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, Minsheng Industrial Company, and Dada and Datong companies, borrowed large amounts of loans from the Ministry of Communications at very low interest rates. These large sums were borrowed by the Ministry of Communications on behalf of the four banks of Zhong, Zhong, Jiao, and Nong, and the Central Trust Bureau and Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau. The Ministry of Communications subsidized the amount of interest shortfall borne by each company. After victory, it subsidized the tools for the rehabilitation of military and public personnel. On the one hand, the shipping industry also began to rehabilitate, and the Shipowners Association drafted a "Statement of Opinions on Urgent Measures for Shipping Rehabilitation" and submitted it to the government for approval. The original text is excerpted below:

Outline of Objectives

### Higher Court Criminal Division Continues Trial of Traitors, Gu and Lin Still Trying to Argue Their Way Out of Crime

[Our Newspaper] At 10:00 am yesterday, the First Criminal Division of the Higher Court of the Shanghai Prison in Tilanqiao opened two traitor investigation hearings under the chairmanship of Investigator Cao Jun, namely the case of Gu Youtang [translator]'s deceit of Chinese workers, and the case of Lin Zhixing [translator]'s bullying and extortion. Both defendants hired lawyers to defend them, and the witnesses summoned by the court also arrived on time to testify.

Soliciting Chinese Workers to Work for the Enemy

Gu Youtang, a translator, is 37 years old and from Ningbo. He lived in Japan around 1926, worked as a chef, and was proficient in Japanese. He returned to Shanghai in September 1937 and returned to his hometown. In the summer of 1938, he made a living by selling straw mats. In April 1939, he entered the stack room of the [Jiangnan Shipyard Pudong Branch] managed by the Japanese merchant Mitsubishi Corporation through the introduction of Japanese Yoshimura Kazuo, and later served as a translator in the factory. In April 1943, [Mitsubishi Corporation] was entrusted by the Japanese to recruit Chinese workers to work in Singapore. The foreman of the factory, Chen Shuiyao, came forward and signed a contract with the deceived Chinese workers, stating that the term would be one year. At that time, there were more than 200 deceived Chinese workers. When "recruiting" workers and "comforting" the families of workers, Gu Youtang served as the translator. Currently, the batch of Chinese workers has not had any letters. After the High Prosecutor's Office investigated and confirmed the case, it was reopened yesterday. Witnesses Zhang Afeng and Jin Du reported that their husbands were deceived and left Shanghai in June of the year before last, and their whereabouts are still unknown. When asked, the defendant said that he only served as a translator and had nothing to do with the recruitment of Chinese workers, and had resigned in May of this year. After 11:00 am, the court ordered Gu to be remanded and rescheduled for retrial. Gu's arrest process is as follows: In August of this year, after Japan surrendered, many families of deceived workers crowded to Chen Shuiyao's house to demand people. Because Chen was cunning and changeable, he had already fled. So they went to Gu Youtang's house. At that time, there was a conflict with Gu, so the police discovered it and took him to the police station, and then transferred him to the court.

Habitually Extorting and Bullying Villagers

Lin Zhixing, 46 years old, from Guangzhou, had worked as a barber in Japan for many years. In February of this year, he served as a translator for the Japanese "Gendarmerie" in Zhenru. He bullied the villagers by relying on the evil power of the Japanese army and habitually extorted money from rice merchants in the town. Prosecutor Lin of the High Prosecutor's Office investigated the case and has concluded it and filed a public prosecution according to law. The main points of the indictment are roughly as follows: The defendant used his position in the Japanese military agency to extort the profits from rice merchants Zhong Jikui and Zhang Xing in Zhenru. Furthermore, on July 6 of this year, because the extortion failed, he even colluded with the "Gendarmerie" intelligence officers Shen Ajin, Liang Bingyan, and Xin Liquan and others to insult and beat Zhong. He should be deemed to have committed the crime of colluding with the enemy and serving in a military position in violation of Article 2, Paragraph 8 of the Regulations on the Punishment of Traitors, and the crime of extortion by force under Article 55 of the Criminal Law. Therefore, a public prosecution was filed. Investigator Cao asked Lin, and Lin denied the extortion, claiming that it was a "reward." The plaintiff, Zhong Jikui, described the process in court and said that if it was a "reward" nature, it should be voluntary, so why did he report it to the police? At 11:15 am, the court ordered that the case was still awaiting deliberation and would be retried at a later date.

Now I urge the seniors of various associations to express their opinions so that we can gather the points that should be improved and quickly report them to the Central Government.

(2) The current difficulty in the recovered area is the issue of taking over, which is also because our trade association did not ask in advance when taking over. Next, Wu Shaoshu gave a speech, hoping that the industrial and commercial circles would assist in the construction. Wu Kaixian thanked all circles for their assistance during his underground work. Subsequently, Lu Jingshi, Special Commissioner of the Ministry of Social Affairs, delivered a speech, saying: As a result of my contact with industrial and commercial industries, I have obtained a secret, that is, we should be sincere and trustworthy in handling affairs, and labor and management must cooperate absolutely in order to realize the industrialization of China.

### Military Affairs Commission Telecommunications Supervisory Section Strictly Enforces Radio Management Supervising Communications to Protect Citizens' Legitimate Rights

The Telecommunications Supervisory Section of the Military Affairs Commission, originally located in Kunming, has now moved to Shanghai due to the relocation of the transportation and telecommunications center. Last month, the section received an order from the Military Affairs Commission to move to Shanghai and coordinate its work within the Inspection Department of the Songhu Garrison Headquarters. It specializes in managing radio stations, radios, and equipment manufacturers in the city, aiming to supervise and guide normal communications and protect the legitimate rights and interests of law-abiding citizens.

Application for Registration Required Within One Month

The section began operations at the beginning of this month. Regarding the management of radios in the city, it is stipulated that all users who have radios must apply within one month to obtain a radio installation permit. Furthermore, users who need to purchase radios must first fill out an application form, which, after being approved by the section, will be issued a purchase permit for door-to-door delivery. Those who fail to register and obtain an installation permit within the specified time will be fined and ordered to stop listening, or their equipment will be confiscated. Only after completing the procedures or making corrections will they be allowed to continue listening or have their equipment returned. Regarding radio equipment, the garrison headquarters has been ordered to strictly control it and has also ordered manufacturers dealing in radio equipment to register with the section within one month and obtain a special business license after approval. Those who do not have a special permit are not allowed to concurrently operate in radio equipment. The sale of materials must be based on a purchase permit issued by the section. Because the status of radio is extremely important today, militarily, aircraft and warships must use radio to transmit messages, and even bandits can use radio. Therefore, the authorities must pay special attention to it so that manufacturers or those who do not know who the purchasers are do not mistakenly sell equipment to criminals, endangering the country.

Calling a Tea Party for Manufacturers

To clarify the meaning of this measure to the radio industry, the garrison headquarters held a tea party for radio equipment manufacturers in the city at the Eight Immortals Bridge YMCA at 9:00 AM the day before yesterday to discuss everything. The Chief of the Inspection Department of the Headquarters, Cheng Yiming, attended and presided on behalf of the Commander-in-Chief, along with the Chief of the Telecommunications Supervisory Section, Hu Zhenyong, Staff Officer Shi Mengkang, and more than 30 manufacturer representatives. Chief Cheng delivered a speech, stating that the purpose of the Telecommunications Supervisory Section of the Inspection Department of the Headquarters in managing radio equipment is: (1) to protect the legitimate rights of manufacturers from the government's perspective; (2) manufacturers must also safeguard national interests, abide by government laws and regulations, assist in implementation, eliminate traitors, and prevent radio from being used by criminals to harm the country. Subsequently, the manufacturers spoke enthusiastically, and under the principle of mutual trust and cooperation, they discussed all technical issues related to the control of radio equipment, dispersing happily at 12:00 PM.

### Unregistered Ships May Not Purchase or Lease

The Shanghai Maritime Affairs Bureau of the Ministry of Communications, in view of the fact that enemy and puppet ships are often privately transferred and indiscriminately bought or leased by anyone regardless of their background, causing difficulties during registration, in order to prevent abuses, hopes that all shipping companies will not arbitrarily buy, sell, or lease unregistered ships without ownership documents. Even when encountering foreign ships, one should investigate their origin and ownership documents in advance to avoid misleading oneself.

### Ministry of Audit Sends Personnel to Shanghai to Check Financial Affairs of Various Administrative Agencies

Xu Zuli of the Shanghai District Circuit Audit Office of the Ministry of Audit recently told reporters: The Ministry has relayed Chairman Chiang's handwritten instruction that the personnel sent to take over the recovered areas are carrying cash, which is causing many problems. In addition, since Shanghai has just been recovered, the government's audit agencies have not yet been established, and the supervision of the accounts of various agencies cannot be delayed. Therefore, I was ordered to come to Shanghai to handle audit matters. Up to now, I have successively checked more than 20 units, including various bureaus and offices of the municipal government, central tax agencies, special envoys of various ministries and commissions of the central government stationed in Shanghai, parks, and the Central China Railway Management Committee, etc., to verify the organizations of the agencies. Most of the organizations of the checked agencies have not been determined, and the budgets have not been established. As a result, there is abuse of personnel, huge expenditures, and borrowing of funds, far exceeding the actual funding issued by the central government, which is a common problem. The situation regarding the handling and takeover of enemy and puppet property is the most complicated, with many units. Just in terms of the agencies responsible for the takeover by the Ministry of Economic Affairs, there are more than 200. Whether the management of the takeover of property is proper and whether there is concealment or smuggling, the administrative authorities should strictly check and expand the investigation methods to strengthen supervision for implementation.

### Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration Reports on Distribution of Relief Supplies and Assistance in Industrial and Commercial Revival

The Translation and Compilation Office of the Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration hosted the Shanghai press at 3:00 PM yesterday on the second floor of the office to report on the establishment of the administration, the quantity of relief supplies that had arrived in China, and their distribution. More than 40 reporters from various newspapers attended. The director of the Translation and Compilation Office, Shen Weitai, chaired the meeting. Mr. Shen first reported on the organizational content and responsibilities of the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA), and then described the nature of the administration, its authority, and its status equal to that of the ministries and commissions under the Executive Yuan.

[UNRRA] After the UNRRA supplies arrive in China, they are received by the administration, and all relief matters in China are handled by the administration. The UNRRA Relief Office in China is only in an advisory and assisting position. In addition, the administration has hired many foreign experts to assist in the technical work of various departments.

The Administration Has Four Offices and Four Departments

The administration has four offices and four departments. The four offices are Storage and Transportation, Distribution, Finance, and Rehabilitation. The four departments are Investigation, Translation and Compilation, General Affairs, and Accounting. A Health Committee is also established. In the recovered areas of the country, fifteen relief sub-administrations have been established, and the Shanghai Sub-Administration is one of them, responsible for handling relief matters in various places. Regarding the sale of supplies, it is handled by the Finance Office. However, supplies distributed to each sub-administration can also be sold by the sub-administration, but it must be approved by the Finance Office and personnel must be sent to supervise. The administration originally moved to Chongqing. Now, because the national government will move to Nanjing, it will move to Nanjing. Some personnel have already arrived in Nanjing. However, Shanghai is the business center of the administration, and most of the UN supplies will be unloaded in Shanghai. Therefore, the business of various departments will also be moved to Shanghai. The Shanghai office of the administration will be responsible for coordinating the national relief business.

A Total of 90,000 Tons of Supplies Shipped to Shanghai

Up to now, thirteen UNRRA relief supply ships have arrived in Shanghai. The supplies on eleven of them have been completely unloaded, and one is currently being unloaded. A total of 90,000 tons of supplies have been unloaded. The types and quantities are as follows: (1) Food: 57,669 tons, including 37,184 tons of wheat, 28,787 bags of flour, 12,738 tons of miscellaneous, 11,545 boxes of standard nutritional rations, 4,050 boxes of coarse milk powder, 6,150 boxes of fine milk powder, and 3,124 boxes of dried beans; (2) Clothing: 87,068 packages of old clothes, 8,905 packages of old shoes, 600 bundles of gloves, 4,495 bags of cotton, 1 box of needles, and 9 bags of thread; (3) Building materials: 81 tons of cement; (4) Medical and health equipment: 215 tons, including 100 tons of DDT, 65 tons of medical equipment, 0.04 tons of penicillin, and 50 tons of milk and milk powder; (5) Transportation equipment: 2,252 tons and 566 vehicles; (6) Agricultural equipment: 864 barrels of insecticides and fungicides, and 3 boxes of veterinary equipment; (7) Fishing equipment: 49 refrigerators, and 1,902 rolls of hemp rope; (8) Industrial and mining equipment: 82 tons of steel bars, and 60 tons of air purifiers; (9) Water conservancy equipment: 266 tons; (10) Welfare equipment and miscellaneous: 188 tons of stationery and 47 boxes of scientific instruments.

Distribution of Relief Supplies

After receiving the above relief supplies, the administration has distributed them to various sub-administrations and agencies for relief purposes. The distribution volume and types are as follows: (1) Food: 1,928 tons to North China, 7,277 tons to Central China, 6,527 tons to South China, 399 tons for rehabilitation, 23,584 tons for finance, 756 tons to the Health Administration, and 8 tons to UNRRA; (2) Clothing: 74,000 packages of old clothes, 4,500 pairs of old shoes, 1 box of needles, and 9 bags of thread to North China. 10,068 packages of old clothes, 2,500 pairs of shoes, and 1,050 pairs of gloves to Central China. 3,000 packages of old clothes, 1,500 pairs of shoes, and 4,495 bags of cotton to South China. Other places are still being distributed; (3) Building materials: All cement is distributed to the Finance Office; (4) Medical aspects: 50 tons of milk powder has been distributed to health agencies in twelve provinces for use. The DDT has not yet been distributed. The 65 tons of equipment has not yet been distributed from UNRRA to the administration; (5) Transportation equipment: 70 vehicles to North China, 149 vehicles to Central China, 133 vehicles to South China, 38 vehicles to the Storage and Transportation Office, 4 vehicles to the Finance Office, 69 vehicles to the Ministry of Transportation, and 76 vehicles to UNRRA. 300 tons of transportation equipment to Central China, 183 tons to the Finance Office, 1,602 tons to the Ministry of Transportation, 20 tons to the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, and 121 tons to UNRRA. There are still 26 tons being distributed; (6) Agricultural equipment and (7) Fishing equipment are all handed over to the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry; (8) Industrial and mining equipment: All steel pipes are handed over to the Finance Office, and air purifiers are being distributed; (9) Water conservancy equipment: 173 tons to the Water Conservancy Committee, and 93 tons to the Finance Office; (10) Stationery: 78 tons to the Finance Office, and 54 tons to UNRRA. One box is still being distributed by UNRRA.

Surplus Supplies Will Also Be Distributed

In addition, among the supplies left by the U.S. military in Kunming, Guiyang, Zhijiang, and Liuzhou, there are 2,000 tons of medical equipment, which are now being received by the administration and distributed to the Guangxi and Henan sub-administrations and health agencies and hospitals in Yunnan, Guizhou, and Sichuan. Hospitals that receive the allocated medical equipment must comply with the following three principles stipulated by the administration: (1) Emergency relief and treatment of patients is completely free; (2) Epidemic prevention is completely free; (3) A 10% quota of free treatment should be set up for general patients.

Relief and Rehabilitation Are Integrated

Mr. Shen finally stated: The supplies provided by UNRRA to China, a part of which is sent to refugees, and a part of which is sold publicly to adjust market supply, so that people who do not need direct relief but have purchasing power can purchase the supplies they need in the market and prevent unreasonable price increases. However, the administration's sale of supplies cannot be regarded as a commercial organization because the administration assists in cultivating the recovery of agriculture, industry, and commerce under the principle of not affecting the market, hindering agricultural and industrial production, or international trade. For example, in the restoration of the Shanghai textile industry, the administration provided a large amount of wool and cotton to assist in its rapid restoration. The funds obtained from the sale of these supplies will still be used for various emergency relief projects in the recovered areas. The total value of UNRRA relief supplies to China is approximately US$945 million. On average, each person in the country receives only US$2 of supplies. Therefore, the administration plans to use these supplies and the funds obtained from their sale as much as possible for post-war active relief work. For refugee relief, it is decided to implement work-for-relief to enable those in need of relief to repair roads, houses, etc., integrating post-war and relief. It can make a lasting contribution to society, and those who are relieved can obtain work, and food, clothing, and shelter can all be solved.

Mr. Wang Renlin Continued to Report

Next, the Deputy Director of the Shanghai Sub-Administration, Wang Renlin, described the organization and work of the Shanghai Sub-Administration. It is said that the position of the Shanghai Sub-Administration is the same as that of other sub-administrations, and the supplies it distributes are also allocated by the General Administration. However, Shanghai is a large port, and various relief supplies are received in Shanghai and then distributed to the sub-administrations. (A) Since its establishment, the relief supplies received by the Shanghai Sub-Administration are as follows: (1) 4,400 tons of flour, 8,521 boxes of Type C military rations, 327 boxes of beef, 227 boxes of various canned fruits have been received, 3,000 packages of old clothes, 1,500 pairs of old shoes, 200 bottles of penicillin. (2) Materials being received include 449 boxes of macaroni, 200 boxes of eggs, 1,564 boxes of dried beans, 20 trucks, 6 staff passenger cars, 200 bundles of gloves. The processing of the above materials (ie, those that have been delivered to various groups) is distributed as follows: 25,576 bags of flour, 7,465 boxes of Type C rations, 603 packages of old clothes, and 38 bottles of penicillin.

Progress of Health and Relief Affairs

(B) The work of the Shanghai Sub-Administration Health Department: (1) 624 bags of flour and 226 boxes of Type C rations have been issued to various hospitals (all based on the number of free beds) for free relief patients to be admitted (27 people before and after). (C) The work of the Relief Department: The work of the Relief and Rehabilitation Office is very temporary, so the principle is to assist the original local institutions and make the most of the time. Currently, 25,576 bags of flour have been distributed to 57 relief organizations. The special work of the Relief Department is to relieve displaced people returning to their hometowns. Currently, two reception centers for returning overseas Chinese have been established, and the third one will also be established. According to statistics, there are a total of 1,500 Jews, 2,500 Central Europeans, 100 refugees, 1,357 Japanese returnees, and 450 Philippine returnees waiting for relief here. In addition to travel expenses, each person sent back to their hometown receives 300 yuan per day for meals and 1,000 yuan for pocket money. (D) Winter relief work has also begun. (1) A large amount of supplies will be supplied to the Winter Relief Committee established by the Municipal Government, and a subsidy of 1.3 million yuan will be given. (2) 90 bags of flour and 60 boxes of biscuits will be supplied to each porridge distribution point (13 in total) per month. (E) The work of the Social Department: Supplying the Temporary Relief Committee for Unemployed Workers (currently there are 90,000 unemployed people) with 9,000 tons of flour, enough for three months.

Items Urgently Needed Have All Been Distributed

(F) The items most urgently needed in Shanghai at present have been requested by the Shanghai Sub-Administration from the General Administration: (A) (1) 9,000 tons of flour, (2) food for refugees and overseas Chinese for three months, 9,375,000 catties of flour, (3) 50,000 sets of winter clothes, (4) 200 sewing machines, (5) 3,000 tons of canned food, (6) building materials for building five shelters, (7) 8,000 beds, (B) Various agencies and groups seek relief supplies, (1) fuel, (2) clothing and bedding, (3) corrugated iron and cement mixers, (4) seeds and fertilizers, (5) wood, (6) fishing boats and fishing gear, (7) port application supplies, (8) cement, (9) power generation equipment for the Far East News Agency. (G) The results of the charity sale totaled 39,268,000 yuan, which was handed over to the Finance Office for distribution. Mr. Wang finally announced three points of the relief work policy: (1) simple and effective, (2) time-saving, (3) small-scale management.

### Who Will Maintain Order in Theaters?

— Jun Yang

On my third day in Shanghai, I went to the China Theater to see "Boy's Travels". Before the show started, an argument broke out in the seats next to me. The reason was that two soldiers without insignia were forcibly occupying seats that had already been sold. Two ladies were holding two tickets, hiding in a corner, watching the theater's front desk staff "negotiate" with these two comrades. They said a lot of nice things, only asking them to move two seats to watch the show, but these two comrades just sat there without moving. This angered a nearby audience member who interjected, saying that soldiers shouldn't be disorderly. The two comrades immediately became furious and asked loudly, "Where are you from?" The person didn't back down and admitted to being from the ××× army. The two comrades became even more enraged, repeatedly shouting, "Even the ××× army can't control me! No one can control me!" The entire theater was in an uproar, and many audience members left their seats to avoid the trouble. In the end, the theater owner had to bow and plead, promising to reserve those two seats for them to watch the show the next night, and only then did the two comrades leave grudgingly. I was a bit bewildered after seeing this, but my cousin, who has lived in Shanghai for a long time and went to the show with me, said, "This is very common. It's been like this ever since the victory."

The day before yesterday, I met the manager of a large theater who said he was planning to resign. I asked him why, and he said the main reason was that "recently, the front desk simply can't handle things."

"You mean there are too many people trying to watch shows for free?" I asked him.

"Yes, those with insignia want to sign for tickets, and those without insignia also want to sign for tickets. If you don't handle it well, they'll get violent! It's really unbearable."

Yesterday, the Central Cultural Movement Committee convened a preparatory meeting for the drama and film association. Mr. Zhong, who is usually punctual, was an hour late this time. As soon as he entered the door, we could see that his usually calm and serene face was filled with indignation. "I was beaten," he said.

The details were as follows: Several military police officers went to the Victory Theater in Hongkou, wanting to go in to watch a show. A dispute arose because the front desk stopped them. The theater staff had to ask the manager, Mr. Gu, to come out. Mr. Gu very politely invited the comrades in military uniform to the manager's office upstairs, preparing to explain the reasons clearly. Unexpectedly, his first sentence, "We are all Chinese," annoyed the comrades. Without distinguishing between right and wrong, they slapped Mr. Gu a few times. Fortunately, others pulled them apart, and these comrades threatened to "come and beat up the theater tomorrow" and left. Poor Mr. Gu had good intentions, only wanting to say, "We are all Chinese, let's discuss things properly, there's no need to argue in front of Japanese residents," but he suffered this insult!

Our soldiers really lack opportunities for entertainment. There are simply no shows or movies in the camp, so they have to go to various theaters outside to find entertainment themselves. However, even so, it seems that some contact should be made, using formal procedures, asking the theater to either put on a complimentary show or issue complimentary tickets, and they shouldn't freely enter and exit, making it impossible to maintain order in the theater, let alone physically assault people. Even if we don't consider the feelings of the local people, so people don't say "With victory, order is gone," at least we should consider international reputation, so the tens of thousands of American soldiers and the Japanese returnees don't describe Shanghai as a city without order, right?

However, having said all that, who should maintain order?

War

### A Record of the Trial of a Suicide Pilot

— Jin Chun

"One morning, a day or two before the American forces landed on Okinawa, we received orders saying that American transport ships had been spotted outside Ryukyu Island, and we were ordered to attack them."

"A total of eight of us set out. They gave me an old seaplane, the fastest speed of which was one hundred and twenty nautical miles per hour. It carried a 250-kilogram bomb, and the fuel was only enough for me to fly to the designated location."

"We also held some ceremonies when we set out, but there was nothing special about them. The commander stood next to a table covered with a white cloth. He handed each person a bottle of wine and wished us success when we drank it. I was the last one, but when I was supposed to shake hands with the commander, I panicked and just stuffed the bottle into my chest."

"When we took off, it was already dusk. We only flew halfway to Okinawa when the plane's propeller stopped working. The moonlight that night was very good. I wanted to find a place to land, but there was no land nearby, so I had to crash the plane into the sea. One of the sailors who was with me had just climbed out of the plane when the waves swept the plane away. We escaped with life jackets. We were together at first, but soon a wave came and swept the sailor away. He was probably swallowed by a carp. I later learned that there were many carp there."

"I struggled in the water for about seventeen hours, and I was a little unconscious two or three times. Finally, I drifted to a small island, a sandy island, the area of which was too small to even be on the map. The entire island had only sixty residents. They were very surprised to see that I hadn't been swallowed by carp. The residents on the island heard that the American forces were using radar, and they thought that any sound would be heard, followed by planes coming to bomb. So everyone didn't dare to speak loudly. Everyone was afraid that the crowing of the rooster would be heard by the radar, so they killed all the chickens, and everyone kept eating chicken. There was only one cow on the island, and because the cow mooed, it was also slaughtered."

The above is the confession of a Japanese suicide pilot. The pilot's name is Okamoto, only twenty-three years old, very handsome, and the trial was held in Tokyo. Okamoto still looked a little bewildered when he spoke.

Okamoto stayed on the sandy island until the end of the war before returning. Not long after he set out, his family received a mimeographed notice from the military with only a few simple words: "Comrade Okamoto crashed his plane into the enemy, perishing with the ship and achieving a heroic sacrifice." When he returned home, his family was overjoyed.

Regarding the Japanese suicide air force (called the "Kamikaze" by the Japanese), there used to be many magical legends: saying that this special attack team was treated very well, enjoying the pleasures of women before death and having solemn ceremonies after death, everything different from ordinary pilots. But according to Okamoto, these were all propaganda from the military, the purpose of which was nothing more than to comfort the families of the deceased, intimidate the Americans, and anesthetize Japanese youth. In reality, suicide pilots were treated the same as ordinary pilots, so they often clashed with their superiors. They thought the treatment should be different, they thought they should only crash into large battleships, and it wasn't worth risking their lives with those small boats. And they always harbored fear in their hearts, they knew that this suicide squad was just a desperate attempt and didn't do much good for the overall situation.

There were also reasons for the Japanese youth to join this suicide squad. According to Okamoto, after joining the suicide air force, he felt slightly relieved of some of his depression, because in this way he could get rid of many worries, at least there was something to do. They all hoped to be assigned a plane to participate in the war, but Japan was very short of planes. Only suicide pilots could be assigned a plane, so as a result, the more excellent pilots had no chance to fight, and a group of young people without combat experience had to join the suicide air force before they had the opportunity to participate in the war. Those who fought were all people without combat experience, which was also a reason for the failure of the Japanese air force.

International

### Treatment of American Soldiers

— Zhao Kuang

There is no other country in the world that treats its soldiers better than the United States. The American people may tighten their belts and save money, but their troops must not be treated poorly. The completeness of their clothing goes without saying. In terms of diet alone, they have a full and reasonable allocation of daily heat units, protein, fat, vitamins, etc. In addition to their salaries, they also have settlement allowances. They can take newspapers and books at will without any charge. They can routinely buy a pack of chocolate candy for five cents and a can of twelve ounces of canned milk for ten cents. In addition, they can watch three movies a day. Needless to say, it's also free. They each have two pairs of shoes and socks, and a full set of coats and shirts. If anything is broken, they can exchange it for a new one at any time. Recently, one of my Filipino students joined the army. He said that clothing and other items alone filled two boxes.

When he first went in, the monthly salary was fifty dollars, plus a settlement allowance of twenty-five dollars a day. The above is naturally calculated in US dollars, and there are additional allowances for children. After serving for thirty years, they can eat "long grain" (receive a pension), so it's no wonder that Americans are happy to join the army.

At the same time, the government is particularly concerned about the careers of veterans who are about to be discharged. Recently, they tried to conduct a survey of occupations after demobilization. The majority of them expressed a strong interest in industries such as grocery stores, radio stations, etc. Some wanted to run chicken farms, some wanted to open tour guide companies and transportation companies, and some were preparing to raise sheep.

No matter which industry they plan to enter, the government always tries its best to provide them with the information needed for that industry so that they have something to refer to. If they lack economic resources, the government will advance the money first. The United States' preferential treatment of soldiers can be said to be meticulous.

### Truman's Confidants

— Shen Yikun

President Truman's advisors are a large and interesting group. Since Truman took office in April, many people in Washington have wanted to know who are Truman's closest advisors.

The fact is, Truman does not have a "closest advisor". He accepts a lot of advice and shares a lot of secrets.

The President listens a lot and thinks a lot after listening. In the White House, he meets almost everyone; and nine out of ten of the people he meets have something to accuse or complain about.

He listens to the opinions of many people and then forms his own opinion. We know that Truman had many years of training in the Senate.

The people closest to the President on a daily basis are his three secretaries and two adjutants.

Charles Ross is Truman's press secretary, and he is always paying attention to the President's progress. Ross's job is to give the nation's readers and listeners the best impression of the President.

Matthew Connelly is the President's appointments secretary, a sharp-eyed, handsome New Englander who has long served as a government investigator. He is the buffer between the President of the United States and the loud and clamorous crowd who are shouting to tell the President a particular aspect of a particular issue.

The third secretary is William Hassett, the only White House veteran left over from the Roosevelt era. Hassett handles most of the President's letters, saving President Truman a lot of trouble due to his many years of work in this area.

The two adjutants are Major General Harry Vaughan and Captain James Vardaman. In World War I, Vaughan was a gunner under Truman, a very humorous person who keeps the President's mood happy forever. Vardaman is a naval reserve officer from Mississippi and a banker in St. Louis. He spares no effort in protecting the President.

However, these people who are close to the President have nothing to do with his major decisions.

Secretary of State Byrnes and John Snyder are perhaps the President's closest colleagues. Byrnes is from South Carolina and used to work with Truman in the Senate. He is one of the busiest people going in and out of the White House.

Snyder is another of the President's closest government officials. He is from Arkansas and is a successful Missouri banker. Recently, rumors have spread that Snyder is going back to the bank in St. Louis, but the President will never let him go easily.

Most Truman administration analysts have overlooked two of his most powerful friends - George Allen and Leslie Biffle.

Allen was a night clerk at a Washington hotel years ago and later served as a commissioner for the District of Columbia. He is now a very successful businessman and a shareholder in some of America's largest companies. If the President has a so-called closest advisor, Allen is undoubtedly one of them.

Biffle is the Secretary of the Senate, and the President often dines with him.

In addition, the President has many people close to him, but it would be impossible to list them all.

Finally, we must mention Postmaster General Robert Hannegan, who is very popular in the White House; nine out of ten of Hannegan's visits to the President involve major political events.

Education

### Broadcasting Aviation Teaching Materials

— Shi Xi

In this era of the "atomic" threat, the world is carefully researching and exploring various new weapons, and there is an extreme "sense of aviation" towards aviation construction.

The United States has incorporated aviation teaching materials into the school curriculum. In schools in Chattanooga and Tennessee, students are taught basic aviation knowledge at the age of seven. High-class students not only learn about the various parts of the aircraft structure but also are given the opportunity to fly in airplanes; flying in nearby cities to broaden their horizons and increase their knowledge of the "living" world is worthy of attention in education.

There are now approximately 28,000 public schools in the United States that have aviation courses. State-run aviation institutions provide assistance, and military and political authorities donate surplus aircraft for student experimentation.

Although our China is difficult to keep pace with Europe and the United States due to limited manpower and material resources, it should also encourage aviation industry within the possible scope, promote knowledge about aviation construction, and in schools, students can be generally taught preliminary aviation academics, such as aircraft principles, aviation history, aircraft model experiments, etc., teaching materials related to the flight industry, and social organizations can also hold aircraft exhibitions or use movies to promote aviation news and aviation construction knowledge, so that our "non-mechanized" nation can temporarily put down the pen and easily use axes and screws; strive for national industrialization and wash away the old "Confucian" thinking of the past.

Today, after the war, at the beginning of national construction, let us seize the great opportunity of a lifetime, broadcast aviation teaching materials, and promote the development of the flight industry to rebuild a new industrialized China.

Agriculture

### The Fate of the Bull

— Shi Guo

The bull, as a symbol of male strength and vigor, is now facing a declining fate. The number of bulls in the world will gradually decrease because artificial insemination is becoming more common, and there are also unemployment problems in milk sheds.

Modern advanced artificial insemination can make a bull produce the equivalent of eighty bulls. Husbands are surplus and eliminated, and bulls are sent to slaughterhouses as veal before they grow up. In Nebraska, the number of bulls will decrease by at least three thousand, but the number of calves produced by artificial insemination is 20,000, increasing every year and reaching 70,000 in 1950.

Artificial insemination has many advantages. Generally speaking, bulls are relatively dangerous on livestock farms, and the cost of feeding them is also relatively high. For breeding, they are really a waste. Now, artificial insemination only costs a 5-yuan handling fee to hire a veterinarian, and extracting one cc of bull semen can be used for artificial insemination, so that each bull can fertilize at least 1,400 cows per year.

Another more important advantage is the selection of excellent germplasm to produce strong offspring. A good breeding bull is worth two thousand US dollars. A single farm may not be able to afford it, but it is more cost-effective to organize an association to jointly purchase and use it in a cooperative manner. Good dairy cows can produce a large amount of milk, so inferior breeds must be eliminated. This is eugenics for cows.

From this, it is not difficult to imagine the path and meaning of human eugenics and reproductive control in the future. Artificial insemination of the human body has already been successful. Some people have said that males are useless in the two sexes. In the future, only a few males or even no males will be needed to breed and reproduce offspring. Of course, human eugenics will never be like this. Bulls have a declining fate, but humans do not. Men don't need to panic now.

Science

### Receiving German Science

— Mu Ming

The Nazi hegemony has been completely destroyed, but the glorious history of the Germanic nation still exists. Germany's contribution to human culture is still valued, especially in science, where Germany has always occupied a unique leadership position. This does not necessarily mean the excellence of the Germans, but German science does have a long history and a good tradition. This advantage should certainly not be destroyed at the same time as militarism, and for the sake of the future interests of mankind, it should be preserved and promoted.

Therefore, receiving German science today is indeed equivalent to receiving a great treasure trove of mankind. According to the United States, it has obtained many research results, completed or not, by German scientists, all of which are admirable and valuable masterpieces that have taken great pains.

Most of the research has military secrets. What can be announced now is a pilot's spring seat, which can be detached from the aircraft at will in an emergency at high altitude and fly through the air without danger even at an altitude of 20,000 feet and at speeds above 500 miles. This is a new invention that the United Nations has not yet succeeded in, and it will be of great benefit to the safety of air force personnel.

The various new and sophisticated instruments in the Zeiss Optical Research Institute are dazzling, and the United Nations bows to them. There is also a giant wind tunnel in the aeronautical testing laboratory, with a wind speed of up to 530 miles per hour, while in the United States, it can only reach 200 miles.

Most of the German scientists have expressed their willingness to surrender and continue to do research work for the United Nations. Before surrendering, they were ordered to destroy documents and research records, but most of them could not bear to do so, so they can still be preserved now. After the war, it is hoped that they will continue to work hard for peace, atone for their sins, and it is not too late.

### Thorough Cleanliness Campaign

— Yu Zhiling

Clearing Sewage, Garbage, and Excrement

Widely Establishing Public Toilets is Essential

The sanitary conditions of Shanghai have changed dramatically since the Japanese invaders ravaged the city. Because of the throngs of refugees and beggars, spitting, defecation, and urination occur everywhere. The patrol police along the roads cannot prohibit it, and the sanitation workers cannot sweep it away. This situation is not only related to hygiene but is also not conducive to the appearance of the city! Now that the municipal administration is being reformed and construction is just beginning, all sanitary matters must be thoroughly rectified and fundamentally resolved.

In all parts of the city, the most unbearable things to see are sewage in ditches, piles of garbage, and excretion along the roads! Now the municipal authorities are rigorously implementing cleanliness and hygiene, carrying out a cleanliness campaign, investigating various neighborhoods and stores, ordering each to set up garbage cans and buckets for dumping at any time. From now on, the garbage problem can be solved. As for sewage in ditches, it should also be cleaned up as soon as possible. In low-lying areas, the road surface should be raised to prevent accumulation after rain, or open culverts to allow accumulated water to easily seep away. The ditches that have not been filled should be filled quickly to avoid rot and stench. This matter is being actively handled by the Public Works Bureau, and it should be a permanent solution. However, urination and defecation along the roads are difficult to prevent because there are so many beggars and pedestrians who scatter at any time. Moreover, the matter of urination and defecation is inevitable for people. The city area is vast, the streets are tidy, and there are very few toilets in the neighborhoods. Pedestrians and beggars are forced to urinate and defecate anywhere due to urgency. This is also human nature. The so-called taking risks in desperation, how can one choose in urgency! This fault is not only in the person urinating and defecating, but the health authorities should also bear their responsibility.

Based on my own humble opinions, I would like to ask the authorities to widely establish toilets in all districts of the city to reduce the harm of urination and defecation! In the past, Westerners governed the concessions, because they thought that setting up more toilets was unsightly and detrimental to hygiene, which caused great inconvenience to citizens. It should be known that urination and defecation are called "excrement" and "urine," so convenience is the priority! Setting up fewer toilets for the sake of cleanliness will increase pollution due to the lack of toilets. The more toilets there are, the cleaner the roads are. It can be seen that the method of cleanliness does not lie in fewer toilets but in more toilets and proper management.

Now it is proposed that a public toilet be set up every mile or so in the city area, and men's and women's toilets must be separated and set up together to facilitate pedestrians. All triangular open spaces at intersections of various roads should be built as public toilets, making use of wasteland and killing two birds with one stone. After public toilets are widely established, if there are still people urinating and defecating on the roadside, all patrol police or those responsible for cleaning the area must send them to the police station for punishment. In this way, the city appearance will naturally be tidy. This is the fundamental way to clean the entire city. I hope the authorities will take action immediately.

### Warning to the Poor: Be Careful Not to Mistake Chemical Products for Food

A letter from the Social Affairs Department of Nanyang Hospital states: "To the Editor, on the evening of the 19th of this month, Liu Yuquan and Liu Yukun, who work as rickshaw pullers, pulled something that looked and tasted like salt. They divided it up and took it home to use as salt, resulting in nine family members being poisoned. Seven people were sent to other hospitals, and Yuquan and Yukun were sent to our hospital, on the verge of death. After emergency treatment in our hospital, they recovered completely the next day and were discharged. Recalling June 30th of this year, the Cao Feng family of five at No. 12 Wenlanfang, Julai Da Road, similarly obtained something that looked and tasted like salt. They used it to make pancakes instead of salt, and the whole family was on the verge of death. After being sent to our hospital for emergency treatment, four people recovered the next day, but a four-year-old child died. After investigation, this salt-like substance is a chemical product and not real salt. Eating it causes poisoning. Our hospital, recognizing that they were all poor people, provided free treatment, which is not worth mentioning. However, we are afraid that ignorant poor people will accidentally eat it again and lose their lives, which would be very pitiful. Therefore, we request that you publish this in your column to advise poor people that if they obtain something that looks and tastes like salt but cannot confirm that it is salt, please do not eat it hastily. Spreading this information will be a great act of merit."

### On Carefree Opium Withdrawal (II)

— Hu Qi

2.  Causes of Opium Addiction

The reasons why the human body can become accustomed to opium (meaning gradually consuming large amounts of opium without causing acute poisoning and death) are still debated by scholars from various countries, so this article will not go into detail. I will only describe the general reasons for opium addiction, which is that opium has effective pain-relieving, sedative, and anti-diarrheal effects. Therefore, patients often use it on their own to treat various painful or long-term illnesses, such as stomach pain, abdominal pain, diarrhea, cough, asthma, gonorrhea, hemoptysis, nocturnal emission, etc., but they do not know that it can only treat the symptoms and not the root cause. So, occasional use seems very effective, but once stopped, the disease recurs. Thus, repeated use leads to addiction over time. Moderate amounts of opium have a temporary stimulating and refreshing effect, which can suddenly increase physical strength and cause a feeling of pleasure. Therefore, many people who are overworked and physically exhausted mistakenly believe it to be an effective medicine. Furthermore, those who engage in debauchery and gambling often use it as a wonderful product for stimulation and refreshment, initially thinking it is just for entertainment to increase interest and eliminate烦恼 (fánnǎo) [troubles; worries], but they do not know that addiction will develop over time, and they will regret it too late! I once conducted a survey and found that most people use opium for stimulation and refreshment to obtain pleasure, followed by those who become addicted due to using it to treat illnesses. There are also very few who are commonly referred to as having "congenital addiction," meaning that during fetal development, their mother's opium habit was very deep, and they develop opium addiction at birth.

3.  Symptoms of Opium Withdrawal

When opium users do not receive a sufficient dose or suddenly stop, they experience various uncomfortable symptoms, which are medically termed withdrawal symptoms, commonly called "fayin." The symptoms that occur depend on the type of opium used, the dosage, the constitution of the user, and the reason for the addiction. Common withdrawal symptoms include yawning, sneezing, tearing, chills, sweating, cramps, fatigue, depression, insomnia, pain, belching, vomiting, diarrhea, nocturnal emission, etc. Although these symptoms are painfully unbearable, they can subside and gradually heal within four or five days for those who are physically strong and have not deeply addicted to opium. However, those who initially used opium to treat a persistent or serious illness often experience hemoptysis, diarrhea, asthma, tremors, collapse, and gradual impairment of heart function when they suddenly stop, and death may also occur.
