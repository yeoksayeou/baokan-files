### Implementing Various Decisive Measures to Gather All Strength and Strive for Victory: Address by the Prime Minister at the Local Governors' Conference

Tokyo, 17th (Central News Agency) - Prime Minister Suzuki, in his opening address at the Local Governors' Conference on the 16th, strongly stated that in the face of the enemy's fierce attacks, every citizen should trust the high command's complete preparations, endure all hardships, and gather all strength to advance bravely on the path to completing the Holy War. He expressed his hope that each local governor would uplift national morale and bravely fight. The gist of his speech is as follows:

The government's future policies were largely outlined at the previous meeting. Domestic measures to address the situation after the homeland becomes a battlefield have been carefully reviewed and largely finalized. This is the basic policy for current measures. The second phase (three months) of the material mobilization plan has also been finalized, and you must do your utmost to ensure its concrete implementation without fail. The government has previously decided to adjust the rationing standards and to implement food measures in response to the situation where the domestic area is turning into a battlefield. The government's policies must be implemented thoroughly under all circumstances to achieve the desired results and stabilize the lives of the people. It is hoped that all of you will pay particular attention to this point, understand the government's intentions, adapt flexibly, and establish measures suitable for local conditions. Furthermore, since the Battle of Okinawa, enemy air raids have intensified significantly, and many small and medium-sized cities have suffered damage. I express my heartfelt sympathy to the numerous victims. However, regarding the enemy's attempt to invade the homeland, we must trust the high command's complete preparations, endure all hardships, and advance bravely to complete the Holy War. I also hope that all of you and the indomitable citizens will stand together on the front lines of the resistance to achieve final victory.

### Defending the Homeland by Building a Solid Fortress: Japanese Army and Navy Await Opportunities to Strike the Enemy

Tokyo, 17th (Central News Agency) - Judging from the course of their operations, the enemy's mobile unit's purpose in this battle is clearly to bomb the Tohoku and Hokkaido regions of Japan, which are outside the B29 bomber range, and to carry out so-called planned bombing of the entire country of Japan, destroying its military and production facilities. At the same time, they are attempting to cut off Japan's transportation lines and frequently dropping mines along the coast. Their actions are noteworthy. The Japanese mainland, from Kyushu to Kanto, has long been within the range of the enemy's B29s. Recently, Kyushu has been included in the attack range of the enemy's air force based in Okinawa. Since July, medium and small-sized aircraft have been attacking Kyushu almost daily. P51s departing from Iwo Jima are also continuing to attack the Japanese mainland. This time, the enemy has dispatched a mobile unit to fight outside the B29 range, attempting to expand the bombing area. For the past ten days, the mobile unit approaching the Japanese mainland has been cruising off the Japanese coast. Therefore, it is difficult to predict where it will appear in the sea area to carry out its shelling and bombing, and vigilance is still necessary. The elite forces of the Japanese Army and Navy are enduring and waiting for an opportunity to make effective and accurate attacks, bringing the enemy to a state where it cannot rise again. At this decisive moment, it is most necessary to secure the viewing troops and use them in blitzkrieg operations.

### Guangdong Charity Organizations Provide Relief to Air Raid Victims

Guangzhou, 17th (Central News Agency) - American aircraft have been bombing the city's residential areas for days, causing heavy casualties among civilians. The city's major charitable organizations, such as the Fangbian Hospital and Shantang, convened a meeting recently to discuss relief measures and immediately passed a declaration calling on compatriots across the country and peace-loving peoples of the world to help stop the bombings.

### Wuhu Security Corps Training Class Opens

Wuhu, 17th (Central News Agency) - In order to improve the quality of its soldiers, the Wuhu Security Corps established a training class. The first group of trainees held an opening ceremony on the 15th and officially began training.

### India Urgently Demands the Restoration of Freedom

Simla, 17th (Central News Agency) - According to information obtained here: Mannu, secretary of the Indian League, told reporters yesterday, "Following the demand for the release of major political prisoners, our second step is to 'restore the freedom of the Indian people'." At the same time, the interim government should also be restored immediately, and the political prisoners who have not yet been released should be released immediately, as there is no justice in keeping them in prison. The recent Simla Conference showed that there is no difference between Indians and co-religionists, the difference only exists between the Muslim League and other factions.

### B29s in Formation Invade the Kanto Region; Ibaraki and Fukushima Also Bombed

Tokyo, 17th (Central News Agency) - Approximately 190 B29s from the Mariana Islands base invaded the Japanese mainland for about four hours starting at 10:30 PM on the 16th. The first formation of approximately 120 aircraft invaded the southwest of Keihin (Tokyo-Yokohama area), and the second formation of 70 aircraft invaded Numazu, Hiratsuka, Odawara, Chigasaki, Tsujido, and other places, dropping incendiary bombs. Fires broke out in the above-mentioned cities, and were completely extinguished by the morning of the 17th.

Tokyo, 17th (Central News Agency) - Approximately 30 enemy B29s invaded the Oita area around 10:30 PM on the 16th, attacking the ground with incendiary bombs, causing fires in and around Oita City, which were completely extinguished around 4:30 AM on the 17th. Also, approximately 90 enemy B29s dropped bombs near Kuwana City around 1:00 AM on the 17th, causing fires in and around the city, which were all extinguished by dawn. On the 16th, the army carried out a surprise attack on P51s coming to the Tokai region. The confirmed results by 7:00 PM that afternoon were 7 shot down and 1 destroyed.

Tokyo, 17th (Central News Agency) - The enemy mobile unit's carrier-based aircraft, the first batch of approximately 80 aircraft, mainly attacked Kasumigaura, Tsuchiura, and Mito from 5:00 AM to 6:00 AM on the 17th, and the second batch of 80 aircraft attacked for about an hour from 6:00 AM. The third batch of approximately 20 aircraft invaded from the north and attacked airfields and military facilities.

Tokyo, 17th (Central News Agency) - The enemy mobile unit, which attacked the Tohoku and southern Hokkaido regions on the 14th and 15th, again attacked the Tohoku region with approximately 80 carrier-based aircraft around 6:00 AM on the 17th, mainly attacking military facilities in Ibaraki and Fukushima prefectures, and fled around 7:00 AM.

### 25 Enemy Aircraft Shot Down and Destroyed in Attacks on the Tohoku Region

Tokyo, 17th (Central News Agency) - The Tohoku Military District Command announced on the 16th: A total of 300 enemy carrier-based aircraft attacked the Tohoku region on the 14th and 15th. As of now, the confirmed results are 21 shot down and 4 destroyed. According to authorities, a fire broke out in Kamaishi City after being shelled and bombed by enemy warships, causing considerable damage. Several Seikan (Aomori-Hakodate) ferry boats were also sunk due to enemy strafing.

### Ternate Island: Japanese Army Clears Out Remaining Enemy; Japanese Army Launches Daring Attacks

Southern Front Base, 17th (Central News Agency) - In order to clear out the enemy landing forces on Ternate Island, the Japanese army dispatched troops to the northern part of the island on the 11th, which was successful. At the same time, they suppressed the enemy on the west coast, searched for and annihilated a large part of the enemy army near Tetademaru, and are currently continuing to clear out the remaining enemy. As of now, the confirmed results are more than 300 enemy soldiers killed or wounded, and the enemy completely destroyed.

Southwest Pacific Base, 17th (Central News Agency) - Regarding the battle situation in the Balikpapan area, the enemy is bombarding the Japanese army's positions with mortars on the Samarinda highway, but not very fiercely. Because the enemy suffered heavy losses on the 11th, they seem to be actively reorganizing their forces. Enemy vehicles are extremely busy going back and forth in their rear positions and landing areas. The Japanese army is continuing to carry out brave surprise attacks. The results achieved by the Japanese army since the enemy landed are as follows: 4,000 enemy soldiers killed or wounded, 18 warships sunk or destroyed, 5 enemy heavy tanks and 7 tanks destroyed, and a large number of artillery pieces captured.

### Great Britain, the US, the Soviet Union, and Chongqing: Conflicting Opinions on East Asian Issues

Central News Agency - According to news from Shanghai: Song Ziwen's swift trip to Moscow, arriving on June 30th and leaving for Chongqing on July 14th, staying for two weeks, meeting with Stalin six times to exchange views, ultimately did not achieve a satisfactory resolution. However, according to the joint statement by the Soviet Union, Stalin and Song will hold talks again soon, but current reports indicate that this will not be possible until three weeks later. Although various sources claim that a satisfactory solution has been reached, there is actually no concrete conclusion. The worldviews held by the Soviet Union and the Chongqing regime are vastly different, and their opinions differ greatly. Song Ziwen's trip to Moscow was actually determined to be undertaken at the request of the United States, with the aim of exploring the Soviet Union's views on East Asian issues. The three-nation conference to be held in Berlin on the 16th will jointly discuss East Asian issues, so Chongqing dispatched Song Ziwen to Moscow to coordinate the Soviet Union's limits on East Asia. The Soviet Union and Chongqing hold different opinions on East Asia in principle. In Chongqing's opinion, it is still unwilling for the Soviet Union to participate in the Pacific War. If the Soviet Union agrees to participate, then Soviet troops will soon enter Chinese territory. Although the United States agrees with Chongqing's opinion, the difference lies in seeking a swift resolution to the Pacific War. Chongqing expresses its hope to prolong the war in order to preserve its own strength. According to Chiang Kai-shek, he feels quite difficult at present. The longer the Pacific War lasts, the more the strength of Japan and the United States will decline, and the United States' pressure on Chongqing will gradually change and soften, which will be more beneficial to Chongqing in the future. Therefore, Chiang Kai-shek's attitude towards the United States is one of perfunctory, in order to maintain strength. On the Soviet Union's side, after the end of the European War, because of the huge losses in the past, it did not consider sending troops to East Asia to resolve the Pacific War, expressing that the longer the Pacific War lasts, the more beneficial it will be to the Soviet Union. With the United States weakening its strength, it can seek to expand its own strength, and on the one hand, it can be more forceful in its voice. Therefore, the opinions of the United States, the Soviet Union, Chongqing, and Great Britain are all unpredictable and full of contradictions, so Song Ziwen's trip to Moscow to negotiate will be difficult to achieve as desired and cannot be resolved immediately.

### Japanese Ambassador Sato Meets with Soviet Foreign Minister

Moscow, 17th (Central News Agency) - Japanese Ambassador Sato met with Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Lozovsky on the 10th of this month, and then met with Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov on the next (11th) day.

Travel Correspondence

### Recent Scenes of Nanhui

— Lan Yu

### County Seat Transportation

Nanhui County Town was built in the 19th year of the Ming Hongwu period, with a circumference of about three li. It borders the East China Sea to the southeast, Fengxian to the southwest, Chuansha to the north, and the Shenjiang coast to the northwest, strategically located at the Yangtze River.

The transportation from Shanghai to Nanhui is as follows: first, take the Shangnan Road small train to Zhoupu, the end point of Shangnan Road, connecting to the Zhounan Highway. There are no public buses, and a private truck operates daily as a substitute, with uncertain times. Passengers must wait in advance next to the station, otherwise only take a small car, which costs more than double the truck fare. There are two inland waterways operating, and the security along the route is slightly better than on land. The Nanchuan and Nanfeng three trunk lines lead to Yongsasha, but the road surface is uneven and security is lacking, so commercial vehicles do not easily venture deep. The county is divided into eight districts, twenty-nine towns, and eighty-six townships, totaling 125,835 households and 522,900 people, making it a throat of Shanghai.

### Nanshi Conditions

Many houses in Nanhui have been destroyed, some by bombs and some by residents demolishing and selling them, with the area near the North Gate being the most desolate. The pre-war county government was considered the best building, but it is now a large square, converted into a sports field. The glory of the past can only be imagined.

In terms of commerce, Nanhui, although a county seat, is far inferior to Zhoupu. The entire city has no large-scale shops, and the streets are very narrow. Recently, due to sluggish business and heavy burdens of various unreasonable surcharges, merchants are unable to maintain operations, resulting in many closures. Among these businesses, restaurants and hotels are the worst off. Restaurants are almost deserted in the evening markets, and their prices are even higher than in Shanghai. There are only three hotels, such as Nanhui Xin and Dongya, with simple facilities.

### Financial Phenomena

There are six or seven financial institutions, which, due to the influence of the environment, have changed their business methods and are seeking income from abnormal means. On the one hand, they issue promissory notes, and on the other hand, they engage in high-interest loans and speculation. On the surface, it seems that financial institutions can obtain high profits, but in reality, this is not the case. They also have deep hidden pains. According to a person in charge of a financial institution, financial institutions can profit on the surface, but in secret, there are many people forcing overdrafts. These overdrafts first open accounts with very small amounts of money, and after a period of time, they issue a check for a considerable amount, sending people to withdraw it, relying on special influence to force the financial institution to reluctantly pay it. Therefore, these financial institutions are racking their brains to do illegal things, and the result is equivalent to working for nothing. However, what is taken from the sheep comes back to the sheep, and it is the general public who are exploited and suffer the most.

There is another phenomenon, which is that long-term checks are often seen on the market. Some of these long-term checks are from local banks, and some are even from Shanghai. It is not uncommon for the term to be one or two months. The issuers are mostly those who overdraft. They give a check to the shop when they buy things in the neighborhood, and even ask the shop to return the change. These checks cannot be cashed at the bank, and they cannot be used after being received. Such double losses naturally mean that the shop has to admit to bad luck. Here is an example: local fuel is very scarce, but firewood is unusually abundant in the surrounding villages. Why not transport it there? In a nutshell: it is because firewood merchants have suffered from long-term checks.

### Land Tax Collection

The county's land tax is divided into two types: diagrammed land and group land. The area west of the city is diagrammed land, and the area east of the city is group land. In addition, there are also distinctions such as salt field land and reed field land. In total, the county has more than 1,278,000 mu of cultivated land. In terms of crops, cotton was the main crop in the past, but because the price of cotton is lower than that of rice, farmers have switched to rice cultivation. According to local old farmers, before the war, one dan of cotton could be worth one and a half dan of rice, but now the price of one dan of cotton is 250,000, less than half the price of rice, and the fertilization of cotton is no less than that of rice. According to farmers' agricultural income, roughly before the war, rice accounted for 30%, cotton for 60%, and miscellaneous grains for 10%; now rice accounts for 60%, cotton for 20%, and miscellaneous grains for 20%.

The collection of land tax, starting from June, has been changed to in-kind collection, first collecting 30%. Because farmers do not have much grain stored, wheat is temporarily used instead, calculated as 40 jin of wheat equals 1 dou of rice. Each household first collects 12 jin, which is collected by the designated four grain stores on behalf of the tax office. The method of completing the tax is for farmers to automatically submit the in-kind items to the collection office. This method is certainly good, as it can prevent the village chiefs from embezzling, but the security in the rural areas is poor. If the items are robbed on the way, farmers will not only have worked in vain, but will also have to bear an additional burden of re-collection. According to the local elders, their opinion is that it is best to set up collection offices in various villages, which can facilitate farmers and be more efficient.

### Education and Charity

Among the local schools, the municipal Fifth Middle School has good results. It used to be a Catholic church, with a bell tower soaring into the clouds. The county has one county-run normal school, two middle schools, and twenty-three complete elementary schools. Recently, the Commissioner's Office plans to establish a joint middle school for the Nanchuan, Shen, and Feng four counties, with the school site roughly located in Zhoupu Town of the county, and is currently under preparation.

The People's Education Center is located in Zhongshan Park, amidst lush trees, with the hope of building the magnificent Zhongshan Memorial Hall. In the center of the hall hangs the plaque "A Model to be Admired" by the late Chairman Lin. The People's Education Center is located inside the Zhongshan Hall. Due to lack of funds, only one or two newspapers are available for reading. According to the curator, another person runs a small five-day publication, featuring local news, which is sold in the area. The local county government, in order to prosper the market, recently recruited a Shaoxing opera troupe in Xinchang to perform at the Zhongshan Hall. In addition to the ticket revenue, the county government subsidizes one dou of rice per day.

Speaking of charitable undertakings, the most regrettable is the relief院 (orphanage), which has a long history, housing more than 200 elderly, disabled, orphans, and widows. Usually, the expenses are covered by public property income, with tens of thousands of mu of public land scattered in various villages. Since the incident, the situation in the rural areas has been complicated, and the income from land rent has been decreasing year by year. In the past, it could still be maintained with difficulty, but recently, various prices have risen sharply, and the person in charge has been unable to cope, so he has had to stop operations. It is reported that this group of refugees has wandered the streets, crying for food, in a miserable state.

### Glimpse of Prices

When the reporter and his party arrived in Nanhui on July 1st, the price of rice was 670,000 yuan, the price of salt was 8500 yuan, the price of meat was over 4000 yuan, and the price of salt was over 1000 yuan. Other daily necessities were also higher than in Shanghai. In terms of restaurants, an ordinary dish costs over 7,000 yuan, and a small bowl of white rice costs 2,000 yuan. One person eats three bowls of white rice, half soup and half dish, which costs over 10,000 yuan, plus taxes and tips. One can imagine the cost. And this meal is not necessarily better than the so-called "hygienic fast food" in Shanghai. Another strange thing is that a haircut costs 8,000 yuan, which is unheard of. Tailors calculate prices based on the price of rice. To make a long robe requires nine jin of rice, costing over 30,000 yuan at current prices. A county government clerk joked to the reporter: his monthly income is 18,000 yuan, and even if he gets free cloth rations, 18,000 yuan is not enough to pay for the tailoring of a gown. Although this is a joke, it shows that civil servants' salaries are too low and prices are too high.

Editorial

### Several Important Tasks Amidst Air Raids

Yesterday, our city was once again subjected to enemy air raids. Approximately sixty or so enemy B-24 and B-25 aircraft intruded into our airspace, indiscriminately dropping bombs from above the clouds onto several locations. This resulted in fires breaking out in several areas of the northeast district. This area is densely populated with civilians, so the actual damage suffered was similar to the previous bombing of Sanpailou in the inner city, affecting entirely innocent and impoverished masses. This is undeniably a cause for grief. However, it also offers a lesson: the enemy air raids lack any specific target. In the future, enemy aircraft may come at any time, and enemy bombs may be dropped anywhere. Therefore, all city residents must be consistently vigilant. Beyond the fact that the Baobaojia (local security system), air defense, and rescue personnel must remain in a constant state of readiness, and be prepared to mobilize immediately upon receiving an alert, ordinary residents must also ensure they have all necessary equipment for firefighting, first aid, etc., ready for immediate use to help themselves and others. Furthermore, the digging of earthen wells and air raid shelters, the regular inspection and cleaning of public and private air defense facilities, the removal of accumulated water and filth from individual and public air raid shelters in each street, the masking of lights at night, etc., must all be individually checked and mutually encouraged, in order to minimize the extent of damage in the event of being hit by enemy bombs.

Enemy air raids cause general residents to suffer unexpected disasters. This kind of indiscriminate and blind bombing merely creates scenes of cruelty and tragedy, which truly fills one with righteous indignation and fuels the spirit to resist the enemy. At the same time, it is a sacrifice for the nation and the war, so the nation has special regulations for relief and subsidies. In addition to the various public and private organizations and groups having their own separate methods for providing compensation and subsidies for those killed or injured in air raids, a portion of the relief bonds launched by our city not long ago has also been designated for temporary disaster relief funds. If enemy air raids become even more frequent in the future, the damage suffered by civilians will inevitably increase, and the need for this fund will be very high. At the same time, we know that there are still many who have subscribed to relief bonds but have not yet paid. We hope everyone will quickly complete their payments. For the sake of public justice and private morality, there is no room for further delay.

From the current situation, it is clear that the enemy intends to use Okinawa as an airbase to launch an aerial offensive. As our city is within its effective bombing radius, frequent enemy air raids are to be expected. To avoid unnecessary damage, those who do not have essential reasons to remain in Shanghai should evacuate as soon as possible. This is especially true for charitable relief, cultural, and educational institutions and groups. Charitable organizations, in particular, were designated for evacuation long ago, but due to various excuses, they have delayed until now, hindering the orderly progress of the city's evacuation efforts. Furthermore, secondary schools and vocational schools should also cease their attachment to Shanghai and evacuate to the countryside and smaller cities as soon as possible. To preserve the nation's and society's vitality, and to avoid pointless personal harm, we hope that leaders from all sectors will proactively promote evacuation. If there are any difficulties, they can consult with the city's Evacuation Committee, which we believe will provide considerable assistance.

During air raids, we must once again advise citizens not to unconsciously climb to high places to observe or point and laugh. At the same time, enemy air raids will inevitably become more frequent. While we should not panic, we must be vigilant against market rumors spread by unscrupulous merchants seeking to raise prices opportunistically. We hope the authorities will pay attention at all times and effectively prevent and control this. The government has already established laws and regulations for criminal behavior during air raids, which should be strictly enforced.

### Preparatory Committee Convened for Yan'an People's Congress

Central News Agency Report: In order to confront the National Congress held by the Kuomintang, the Yan'an regime previously decided to independently convene the Yan'an People's Congress. According to Yan'an Broadcasting, at 9:00 AM on the 13th, Yan'an held the inaugural meeting of the 'Preparatory Committee for the People's Congress' at the Party Headquarters. Attendees included representatives from the military, laborers, students, educational institutions, youth and women, journalists, writers, doctors, and other sectors, totaling approximately 116 people.

### Dong Biwu Makes Remarks in the United States

Guangzhou, 17th, Central News Agency Electric: According to Chongqing Broadcasting, Dong Biwu, the Yan'an representative to the San Francisco Conference who is currently staying in the United States, recently met with a United Press reporter and made the following remarks on issues such as the formation of a coalition government: If China adopts a one-party dictatorship after the war, civil strife will inevitably occur. If a democratic coalition government is established, civil strife can still be avoided. Although Yan'an has not sent representatives to the National Political Council, the councilors are still retained. In the future, if a coalition government can be established, Yan'an will definitely support Chiang Kai-shek as chairman.

### Italian "Patriot" Groups Dissolved

Berne, 17th, Central News Agency Electric: According to news from Northern Italy: the Italian anti-Fascist "Patriot" groups were formally dissolved yesterday. However, in southern Italy, such as the Calabrian mountain region, a few groups are still active, and in the name of "anti-Fascism," they continue to resist dissolution. Several groups have even attacked prisons and those imprisoned within.

### British and American Leaders Hold Informal Talks - Touring Berlin for a Week Before the Meeting

Stockholm, Sweden, 17th, Central News Agency Electric: According to reports from Berlin: Prime Minister Churchill and President Truman held an informal meeting in the conference hall in Potsdam yesterday. At the same time, senior staff members from the British and American armies gathered there for their first meeting. However, there is currently no official confirmation as to whether Marshal Stalin is already in Berlin. President Truman toured Berlin the day before, under the protection of a squadron of armed soldiers. He visited the ruins of the Brandenburg Gate and Unter den Linden. Afterward, he went to Hitler's office on Wilhelmstrasse. Security was tight along the roads that Truman traveled. Prime Minister Churchill also made a thorough tour of Berlin yesterday. After arriving in Potsdam by car, Churchill, accompanied by Foreign Secretary Eden, indulged in a tour. They were warmly welcomed at the Brandenburg Gate by Colonel General Kolpakov, the county governor of the Soviet military government in Berlin.

### Witnessing the Scars of War Evokes Emotions

Churchill and others first visited the German Congressional Hall, followed by Hitler's office. They were led inside by Soviet guards, and saw the magnificent halls, all destroyed by fire. They then went to Hitler's study and banquet hall. Foreign Secretary Eden could not help but feel emotional, recalling that he had dined with Hitler in the banquet hall in 1935. They then visited Hitler's famous bunker, which Churchill found very interesting.

### Speculations on the Contents of the Big Three Conference

Lisbon, 17th, Central News Agency Electric: Various speculations are circulating about how the Big Three Conference will decide on the post-war handling of Europe and other cases. Summarizing various British and American reports, the core of the discussions is generally the following points: "Handling the German Case": According to a Washington dispatch from The Times of London, the U.S. President seems to intend to establish a tripartite agreement between Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union, followed by the addition of France, creating a four-nation agreement to establish both provisional and long-term handling methods. The first is to be implemented in the current U.S. occupied zone, with a duration of one to five years. The second is to implement a permanent peace system, the content of which is still unclear, but it seems that the key is to ensure that Germany cannot recover. "Establishing a New Order in Europe": A New York Times special correspondent reported that Truman's main objectives are threefold: first, to establish a new order in Europe based on the principles of the Atlantic Charter; second, to determine new European borders; and third, to use the Potsdam Conference to prepare for a peace conference, in order to solidify its foundation. A Reuters dispatch from Washington stated that political and economic issues in newly liberated areas and former Axis satellite states, especially the issue of democratic systems, are key to handling the post-war situation and establishing a new order. "The Mediterranean and Balkan Issues": Border disputes in the Balkan countries involve realistic issues of interest to both Britain and the Soviet Union, so it seems that agreement will be reached on how to handle these issues. "East Asian Issues": According to a Daily Mail Reuters dispatch, it is generally believed that the Pacific War situation and Stalin's meeting with Song Ziwen will be discussed at the Big Three Conference. The fact that the three countries' representatives are leading their highest military leaders to participate in the conference is the basis for this observation, and all newspapers emphasize the Soviet Union's position.

Zurich, 17th, Central News Agency Electric: In addition to discussing the joint administration of German occupied territories, the Big Three Conference will also review the issue of reparations. According to informed British sources, the amount of reparations is expected to be 20 billion yuan. This may not be paid in cash but in labor. It is said that the Soviet Union has requested 2 million laborers for post-war reconstruction. In addition, East Asian issues will also be on the agenda, as the Soviet Union is currently paying unusual attention to East Asian issues.

### Bose Broadcast

Shonan (Singapore), 17th, Central News Agency Electric: Subhas Chandra Bose, chairman of the Provisional Government of Free India, broadcast to India from Shonan on the 15th regarding the breakdown of the Simla Conference, stating that the Indian side's resistance to the cunning British proposal is a cause for great celebration for the independence movement, for all of India, and for himself personally. At the same time, the conference had fully adopted the attitude expressed by the leaders of the National Congress Party, but for the sake of the present and the future, there is a need for further review and reflection. It is regrettable that since the Wavell Proposal, a faction within the Congress Party, including Nehru, has been fawning over the British from the outset. Praising the sincerity of Britain and Wavell is especially pointless, and can be said to be an automatic abandonment of the oath we took three years ago. However, the firm attitude of Gandhi is admirable. Regarding the thorough implementation of principles, Jinnah of the Muslim League is the most correct. Jinnah has shown the most appropriate attitude to realize the ideal of dividing Hindus and Muslims. However, some leaders of the Congress Party mistakenly believe that Wavell is placing the Congress Party on an equal footing. Otherwise, Britain would never have such a close relationship with us. If they have not considered this point, then they are not qualified to be leaders of the Congress Party. As a result, Jinnah's power at the Simla Conference has increased, while the Congress Party has lost its credibility, which may lead to various disadvantages in future struggles against Britain. The Congress Party's activities, from the perspective of the Indian independence struggle, were originally very favorable. However, they failed to examine themselves and instead fell into breaking their former oaths. Their lack of a clear stance is evident, and this attitude must be changed in the future. In the future, the Congress Party does not need to sit at the same table as other factions at conferences such as the Simla Conference. The so-called peace conference is a meeting of like-minded comrades. It is the Congress Party, not the Muslim League, that is fighting against Britain, because the Muslim League is a movement engaged in by landlords and capitalists, merely preserving their authority under British control. Only the movement of the Congress Party can be said to be the true movement of the Indian people.

### Tolstoy Museum Moved to Moscow

Central News Agency Report, TASS Moscow Report: The Leo Tolstoy State Museum has been moved from Tomsk, Siberia, to Moscow, and will open soon. The museum has collected approximately one million valuable exhibits, including Tolstoy's unique manuscripts, rare editions translated into 36 European and Oriental languages and 50 languages of the Soviet Union, the great writer's personal belongings, private letters, and paintings and sculptures by great Russian artists, depicting Tolstoy's appearance in various eras of his life. Museum staff are conducting large-scale research, and they have published 22 books and many interesting articles about Tolstoy. The granddaughter of the genius writer, Sofia Tolstoy-Yesunina (45 years old), is the director of the museum, and her husband is the famous Russian poet Sergei Yesunina.

### Literary Master's Relics Publicly Exhibited

In the first exhibition about the Tolstoy family, there are portraits of the writer's father, Count Nikolai Tolstoy, and portraits of Tolstoy's grandfather, Prince Nikolai Volkonsky, and his mother. Several family heirlooms are particularly interesting, including Tolstoy's father's ring, the Tolstoy family crest, snuffboxes, etc. The correspondence between Tolstoy and his wife forms part of the family archives. Visitors can also see Tolstoy's love letters to Sofia Behrs, Tolstoy's wife's diaries, and letters to her husband in 1864, etc. Another exhibition is dedicated to Tolstoy's experiences as a soldier and poet in the Crimean War. Among the relics is a saber given to Tolstoy by his friend in the Caucasus in 1852, two dim Saint George crosses, and a short song Tolstoy wrote during the Battle of Chernaya Rechka. Tolstoy's archives contain 50,000 letters from the United States, Poland, France, Sweden, Greece, Egypt, China, and many other countries.

### Zhejiang Provincial Government Rectifies Tax Collection

Hangzhou, 17th, Central News Agency Electric: Various taxes in Zhejiang Province are a major source of revenue for the provincial treasury. In order to enrich tax sources without increasing the burden on the people, the Finance Department has decided to rectify the ordinary business tax, implement open quotas, thoroughly investigate, and abolish the commission system.

### Over Sixty Enemy Aircraft Attacked Shanghai Twice Yesterday - Indiscriminate Bombing of Residential Areas Kills and Injures Hundreds of Civilians

The Shanghai Army and Navy Garrison Headquarters announced yesterday (17th) at 2:30 PM: At approximately 1:00 PM on July 17th, about 64 enemy B-24 and B-25 aircraft intruded into the Shanghai area, dropped bombs from above the clouds, and fled without a trace. Our losses were extremely minor.

(Further report) The areas bombed by the enemy aircraft were mostly unimportant, mostly civilian areas. The deaths and injuries number in the hundreds, and some areas were hit with incendiary bombs. Details are still being investigated.

Details of the Air Raid

The enemy aircraft's attacks on our city on the 17th were as follows: The first attack occurred at 1:05 PM, when enemy aircraft entered our city from the east and retreated to the north at 1:31 PM. The number of aircraft was approximately 50 B-24s and B-25s. The second attack occurred at 1:35 PM, when enemy aircraft entered our city from the east and retreated to the north at 1:51 PM. The number of aircraft was over 10 B-24s and B-25s. Both times, they indiscriminately bombed densely populated civilian areas in the northeast of our city from above the clouds, causing fires to break out in several places. All fires were extinguished within 30 minutes. Military facilities suffered almost no damage. Over 300 civilian houses were destroyed. As of now, approximately 300 deaths have been confirmed, approximately 120 people have been seriously injured, approximately 400 people have been slightly injured, and the total number of victims is feared to exceed 1,000.

Interception Battle

Yesterday at 1:05 PM, enemy aircraft launched a large-scale indiscriminate bombing of our city, dropping bombs from the cloud cover. Because enemy aircraft had flown over several times to reconnoiter in the morning, we had already realized the enemy aircraft's intention to move. Our air defense preparations were strengthened. As expected, enemy aircraft attacked at that time, flying very high, with their bodies hidden in the clouds. Judging from the sound of the engines, they were B-24s and B-25s, numbering approximately 40-50. They intended to cross the northeast part of our city from east to west. Our air defense artillery fired fiercely. To avoid being hit, the enemy aircraft fled to the north. Our interception fighters also took off and pursued. Later, at 1:35 PM, enemy aircraft attacked again, launching a wave attack and bombing blindly. Japanese warships anchored on the river fired at them, and ground artillery also fired fiercely. The fire from the interception formation was extremely intense. The enemy aircraft merely sacrificed innocent civilians, and at 1:51 PM, they fled west in a panic.

Treatment of the Wounded

Those who were victims of the indiscriminate bombing in the eastern district of our city yesterday have been sent to relevant hospitals by the air defense authorities for treatment. The families of these injured patients must go to receive them by 3:00 PM this afternoon (18th). The locations for receiving the injured and bodies are listed below: Shanghai East Hospital, Meizhou Road, Yangshupu; Shanghai Sanitarium, Old Barracks Road (Wujin Road); Reception Center, Tangshan Road, Gongping Road, Tilanqiao.

### Scam Involving 20 Million Worth of Bad Checks Cracked - Laochang Precinct Arrests Criminals and Brings Them to Justice

Since the current shortage of cash in our city, payment orders and promissory notes have flooded the market. At the same time, the practice of paying with checks has also become prevalent, leading to repeated cases of forging and altering payment orders and promissory notes. The police authorities have repeatedly solved cases and arrested criminals for prosecution. It has been learned that the Laochang Precinct has cracked another major case involving a criminal who defrauded over 20 million with bad checks. The victims number over dozens of families. The criminals Li Afu, Qu Da, Xu Min, and others have been successively arrested and brought to justice. The details are recorded below:

Using Dance Hostesses to Pose as Wealthy Patrons

The criminals Li Afu, Qu Da, Xu Min, and others had previously been sentenced for crimes such as kidnapping. After being released from prison, they had nothing to do, so they rented Room 21 in the Xindu Apartment on Nanchang Road, intending to use bad checks to defraud property. Therefore, they opened current accounts at the Mianbu Bank and Baoyuan Qianzhuang respectively, obtaining three checkbooks. They indiscriminately wrote checks for purchases and meals outside. The dance hostesses Wang Dehua, Gao Qiuxia, and Zheng Xuefang of the Dahuhu Dance Hall also rented Room 22 next door. They became acquainted when Wang and others played the harmonica and they harmonized. They were then lured in every way into their scheme. On July 11th, Li Afu, Qu Da, and Xu Min, along with the three dance hostesses Wang, Gao, and Zheng, went from the Xindu Apartment to the Dahua Cafe for coffee. After drinking, they paid with a check. Then they went to the Kangle Restaurant for dinner, and then to the Yiwentai Nightclub for dancing. Finally, they rented a room at the Xiangsheng Hotel and paid with checks.

Riding Around in a Car to Swindle Goods

At about 7:00 AM the next morning, they hired a car from the Yunfei Car Company to drive around. First, they went to Guohua and bought peaches with a check outside the Guohua Temple. Then they ordered the driver to return to Shanghai, to the Daxin Department Store on Luoyang Road, where they bought Hong Kong shirts and women's cosmetics worth over 600,000 yuan with a check. They then got back in the car and went to the Rongkang Sihouse on Huashan Road for a meal. Then they went to the Jinhu Shoe Company on Zhengyang Road and bought five pairs of women's leather shoes. They went to the Wanchang Raincoat Company in Xieqiao Alley and bought eight raincoats, worth over 2 million yuan. They then went to the Jinmen Clothing Company and bought three coats. Then they went to the Huamei Hotel on the Bund and rented rooms but did nothing. Then they rented Room 338 at the Tianran Hotel on Zhifu Road and put all the items in the room. They then got in the car and went to Hengdeli to buy three watches, worth 1.85 million yuan. All of the above were paid for with checks. At about 4:00 PM, they went to the Xinya Restaurant for a meal. On the spot, they gave the driver a check for 530,000 yuan for the car rental and a small check for 180,000 yuan and ordered him to leave. At the Xinya, the bill was 133,720 yuan. Li Afu then wrote a check for 150,000 yuan from the Baoyuan Qianzhuang, which was rejected, leading to a conflict. Li Afu and Xu Min saw that the situation was not good and first fled with Gao Qiuxia and Zheng Xuefang. The waiter of the Sihouse reported to the accounting room, who held Qu Da and Wang Dehua and reported to the Laochang Precinct. The director of the third unit ordered police officer Zhang Guodong, police sergeant Liu Zongtong, and Shen Zhiming to investigate. They confessed the details and investigated in all directions. They arrested the remaining criminals Li Afu and Xu Min, and the exploited dance hostesses Gao Qiuxia and Zheng Xuefang, at No. 565, Dajiangnan Hotel, and confiscated all the items they had swindled that day.

Victimized Businesses Report to the Precinct

Li confessed that he had used bad checks to defraud not only the above-mentioned stores, but also the Dianzi Store, Xinxin No. 1 Building, Nanguo, Central Western Clothing Store, Jinmen Hotel, Gaoshiman Dance Hall, Laozhengdian Restaurant, bathhouse, and Yangliu, Taotao, Xinmingming, Night Club, Sanle, and No. 1 Dance Hostess Agency on Jingansi Road, totaling over 20 million yuan. The Precinct hopes that all victimized companies, businesses, and stores that have received bad checks with the account names "Li Afu" "Li Guanglie" of the Baoyuan Qianzhuang and "Xie Wenche" of the Mianbu Bank, will report to the third unit of the Precinct for closing the case.

### Early Opening of Dance Halls Will Be Punished

The Municipal Police Bureau's regulations for dance hall operating hours are from 5:00 PM to 11:30 PM daily (5:00 PM to 7:00 PM for tea dances, 8:00 PM to 11:30 PM for evening dances). However, recently some dance halls have disregarded the law and opened early, holding tea dances from 2:00 PM to 5:00 PM, which is unacceptable. Therefore, the Second Administrative Section has ordered the prohibition of tea dances. Violators will be severely punished, and branch bureaus will be responsible for enforcement. Dancing is also prohibited in cafes during the aforementioned hours.

New Police Chief Takes Office at Penglai Bureau

Ge Hanyi, the newly appointed chief of the Penglai Road Police Bureau, formally took office yesterday morning. After completing the handover, he convened a meeting with the heads of various sections and all police officers for an address.

### School Principal Punished for Fraudulently Receiving Special Rice Allotments

Yang Yaqiu, the principal of Qin Zhi Private Elementary School on Liyuan Road in the Nanshi district, used the alias Yang Zhiying to falsely report the number of teachers and fraudulently receive special rice allotments. She also embezzled and withheld the teachers' special and fair-price rice. After the school's teachers Yuan Xiuying and Li Juemin reported her to the Education Bureau, the principal retaliated by falsely accusing teacher Li Juemin in the Shanghai Local Court. Upon learning of this situation, the Education Bureau immediately sent personnel for a secret investigation and reported it to the Municipal Government. An order was issued to discipline the principal. The Education Bureau has now ordered the school's board of directors to remove Principal Yang Yaqiu to rectify the school's atmosphere. Simultaneously, the principal is strictly limited to returning the fraudulently obtained rice allotments directly to the Economic Bureau. Regarding the embezzlement of special and fair-price rice and other disciplinary issues at the school, the board of directors is ordered to handle the matter appropriately and carry out strict rectification.

### Banks and Financial Firms to Standardize Next-Day Clearing for Customer Checks

Member banks and financial firms in the city had previously proposed implementing next-day clearing for checks due to the increasing volume of checks received, making exchange and transfer procedures difficult. However, financial firms expressed disagreement, and the matter was dropped. It has now been learned that both banks and financial firms are generally using next-day clearing for all customer checks, and some firms have notified customers that the banking and financial industries will uniformly implement this practice starting on the 20th of this month. Regarding the matter of customers depositing checks on the current day but receiving next-day clearing, reporters inquired with banks and financial firms for details. It was reported that many firms have already automatically implemented next-day clearing, especially those in the downtown area, and have been doing so for quite some time. Therefore, the banking and financial industries are actively considering the uniform implementation of this practice, which is expected to be realized soon. The alleged date of the 20th has not yet been formally announced by the banking and financial industries. This next-day clearing effectively means that checks received on the current day are exchanged the next day.

Statistics on Check Clearing for Last Month

The Joint Reserve Committee of the city's banking industry recently released the total figures for interbank exchange and collection of checks for the month from June 1st to June 30th of this year: Exchange of checks: 497,663,815,100.00. Collection of checks: (A) Paid by exchange banks: 327,338,142,700.00. (B) Paid by foreign banks: 105,933,184,300.00. (C) Paid by correspondent banks: 266,266,988,872.15. Total: 699,538,315,872.15. Grand total: 1,197,202,130,972.15. Previously, the Bank Association's collection of checks included figures for payments made by member financial firms, but since June, these have been handled independently by the financial firms' treasury, so the Association's usual figures have been removed.

### Prices of Tooth Powder and Cotton Fluff Approved

The city's Price Evaluation Committee continued to approve the prices of tooth powder and cotton fluff. The price of "Invincible" brand facial tooth powder (50cc) is set at 200 yuan per package, and the price of cotton, including fluffing labor, is set at 12,000 yuan per market catty. In addition to instructing the relevant industries to strictly comply, the Committee has also sent a letter to the Fourth Division of the Police Bureau, instructing all squads to strictly enforce these prices.

### Cigarettes Distributed to City and County Police

The city's Liaison Office, to encourage the service spirit of police officers in various counties, repeatedly requested monthly cigarette allocations from the Japanese Embassy in its capacity as a liaison office. After repeated efforts, this has been approved. It has been learned that the cigarettes allocated for June are of the "Tongfu" brand, totaling 450,000 cigarettes. The head of the Liaison Office's Shimizu section recently informed the County Government Management Office, which consulted with the Municipal Government's General Affairs Section to advance the allocation price of 1,260,000 yuan and transportation costs of 30,000 yuan for retrieval. The average value of each cigarette is 2 yuan and 87 fen. After allocating 150 cigarettes per person to the county police officers according to the Liaison Office's original list (a total of 371,250 cigarettes for the seven county police bureaus), there is a surplus of 78,750 cigarettes. With the approval of the County Management Office and the Municipal Government, these will be evenly distributed to the staff of each county government, with an average allocation of 32,287 cigarettes per county. The County Management Office has issued orders to the county governments and police bureaus, instructing them to quickly prepare funds, send personnel to the Municipal Government to collect the cigarettes for distribution, and strictly prohibiting any deductions.

### Stores Fined for Not Filling Out Special Tax Invoices

Many stores in the city have failed to comply with the regulations set by the Finance Bureau regarding the use of invoices for collecting special consumption taxes. Over 640 stores have been investigated and punished by the Finance Bureau. The Bureau's Supervisory Section has again sent personnel to investigate whether stores are using invoices as required. As a result, 30 stores, including Yuan Dachang Tobacco Shop at 128 Hubei Road, were found to have purchased special tax invoices but were not issuing them to customers, suggesting intentional tax evasion. In addition, 20 stores, including Kaili Company at 755 Jing'an Temple Road, were using self-printed invoices that had not been stamped by the Bureau, which also violated regulations. The Finance Bureau has imposed penalties on all of the above stores according to the severity of the violations.

### Gold Securities Market Report

After the opening of the gold securities market yesterday, it continued to rise, following the upward trend of the previous day. The rise weakened in the middle of the day, but the closing price was still higher than the previous day. Prices are recorded as follows:

Due Bills: 5,600,000 yuan, up 730,000 yuan from the previous day. Series IV Bills: 5,650,000 yuan, up 750,000 yuan from the previous day.

Now that transportation arrangements have been made, the shipment of salt, estimated to be over 20 million dan, is expected to arrive this month.

Re-election of Directors and Supervisors of the Shanghai Banking Association: The terms of the second board of directors and supervisors of the Shanghai Banking Association expired at the end of June of this year. As a result of the general membership meeting convened on June 28th, the original directors and supervisors were re-elected.

Reader Scholarship News

### Six Thousand Children of New and Returning Applicants Desperately Await Assistance

We Hope That Enthusiastic People Will Quickly Extend a Helping Hand

Our newspaper's reader scholarship program has helped many, with over 3,700 students receiving assistance last session. These were returning students from the seventh session. At that time, new students from various schools applied for assistance, but our newspaper, due to the limited donations from all sectors of society, which were insufficient for distribution, rejected the new students' applications. This was a helpless matter! However, we always felt that not accepting new students was unreasonable and unbearable. Therefore, this session, in addition to issuing application forms to returning students as usual, we also issued application forms to new students through various levels of schools, carefully selecting impoverished and outstanding students, earnestly recommending them, and then rigorously screening them at our office to select the most academically outstanding to be admitted as recipients for this session. In recent days, returning students have been enthusiastically coming to the office to collect application forms, and new students have also been coming one after another, represented by their schools. It appears that these 6,000 children all have hopes of receiving scholarship money. Even after the qualifying examination, many, whether new or returning students, will be eliminated. This completely depends on their own academic performance for good fortune. Fortunately, the qualifying examination is extremely fair and impartial; so many with true talent and practical skills absolutely need not worry!

In fact, what is worth worrying about is the donations for this session's scholarship money. There has been no improvement in the past ten days. We do not know why the enthusiastic and powerful philanthropists are still late in coming, and the recognized donations are few. Gentlemen and ladies: These 6,000 children are like little birds on branches, desperately awaiting food. The situation is extremely urgent. We hope that enthusiastic philanthropists will quickly extend a helping hand, providing material relief, so that their thirst for knowledge will not suffer an unexpected famine!

The Ninth "Shen Bao" Reader Scholarship Special Fundraising Team

### Measures for Issuing License Plates for Private Motor Vehicles

To encourage wartime conservation, the former Municipal Public Works Bureau had already restricted the registration of motor vehicles. Since the establishment of the Municipal Construction Bureau, many citizens have been unclear about the regulations. Therefore, the Bureau has coordinated with relevant parties to formulate interim measures for issuing license plates and permits for private motor vehicles, which have been submitted to the Municipal Government for approval and implementation. The measures are recorded as follows:

Applications for private motor vehicle license plates and permits from heads and senior officials (two terms or more) of central and municipal government agencies must be accompanied by a letter of certification from the respective agency and will be issued after approval.

Permits will generally not be issued to citizens of the city. In special circumstances where the use of a motor vehicle is necessary, a certificate from a military, police, or government agency must be provided and will be issued after approval, but this does not apply to those who already hold a permit and are applying for renewal.

Applications for private motor vehicle license plates and permits from foreign nationals must be accompanied by a certificate from the embassy, consulate, or military agency of their respective country (the certificate must bear the official seal of the agency) and will be issued after approval.

The above regulations do not apply to those specifically permitted by the Mayor or the Secretary-General of the Municipal Government.

All procedures for applying for the registration of private motor vehicles, the issuance of license plates, and permits shall still be handled in accordance with existing regulations.

### A Glimpse of the Bombed Area in Northeast Shanghai

— Qi Chang

Yesterday afternoon around 1:00 PM, more than sixty enemy aircraft invaded the airspace over our city, indiscriminately bombing. This air raid can be said to be the one that has caused the most suffering to civilians. Northeast Shanghai was especially affected. Several streets were hit.

The number of casualties has not yet been tallied. In addition to those transported by the Pushan Mountain Villa, there are hundreds of seriously injured people who were transported to hospitals such as Housheng Hospital. When the reporter inspected the disaster area, there were still dozens of corpses lined up on the sidewalks, waiting for their relatives to come and claim them.

At a certain intersection, there were many food stalls, snack stalls, pancake stalls, and fruit stalls. It was lunchtime, and some laborers were having lunch or taking a short break. However, the bomb fell right there, and they all perished together. Dozens of people died in this way.

Almost all of the casualties were civilians. The areas affected were mostly shops and residences. From the broken signs, one can still vaguely make out tobacco and paper shops, shoe and hat shops, grocery stores, and so on. Just a short time ago, this was a bustling and prosperous street, but now it is filled with smoke, and the buildings are dilapidated and beyond repair.

In addition to a bloody corpse on the road, there were also large patches of thick blood stains, trampled by people, buried under rubble and wood. It is unknown how many people were buried alive. Those near the sidewalk were easier to find. The reporter saw a person being pulled from a pile of bricks four hours after the incident. The injuries were not very serious, but if he had been discovered earlier, he might not have died!

Chinese and Jewish relief workers were working hard, running on the roads filled with fire and rubble, bravely carrying out rescue work. The injured were lying on trucks, rickshaws, and stretchers, being sent to various places for emergency treatment. The empty stretchers were almost all covered with bloodstains, and in some cases, large patches of blood were still shaking on the canvas.

Many entire families probably died in this air raid. Someone heard that this area had been bombed and made a special trip to visit a relative, but when this person finally managed to identify the family's location, they only saw broken bricks and rubble. They asked the people next door and learned that two seriously injured people from the family had been sent to a hospital.

Given the severity and scope of the disaster caused by this air raid, we feel that it is necessary to strengthen the dissemination of air raid prevention knowledge, provide technical training in disaster relief and rescue, and provide extensive relief to the victims of the disaster area. What is especially important is that we hope that citizens will quickly evacuate to avoid unnecessary casualties and losses.
