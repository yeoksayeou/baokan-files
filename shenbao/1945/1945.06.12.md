### Government's Attitude Towards Implementing Compulsory Service Laws: Responses from the Prime Minister and Minister of the Army to Questions

Tokyo, 11th (Central News Agency Telegram) - At the plenary session of the House of Peers on the afternoon of the 10th, Prime Minister Suzuki and Army Minister Anami gave the following replies to questions from Mr. Godo Takuo regarding the government's attitude towards enhancing fighting spirit and implementing compulsory service laws:

Prime Minister Suzuki

I believe that the loyalty of the people is the foundation of combat strength. Therefore, the National Volunteer Corps is the most important organization at this critical juncture for the rise and fall of the nation. I hope that the loyalty and patriotism of all the people can be fully demonstrated through this organization.

Army Minister Anami

The primary duty of the volunteer fighting corps is to serve in military affairs. However, in order to ensure that they can exert their effectiveness even after being transferred to fighting corps, the government will provide appropriate guidance within the possible range to enhance their production capacity. At the same time, they will receive moral education to instill discipline and cultivate their inherent spirit in their production activities, so that their production capacity can be strongly demonstrated.

Three Japanese Units Achieve Military Success in Burma: Army Ministry Separately Announced Yesterday

Tokyo, 11th (Central News Agency Telegram) - The Japanese Army Ministry announced the following on June 11th: Sergeant First Class Mine Kuniji and eight others, while participating in operations in central Burma, used an Imperial-bestowed cannon to launch a fierce attack on the enemy's armored units, achieving glorious results. All of them perished together with the Imperial-bestowed cannon. They had previously received a commendation, and this time they were further reported to the Emperor, who specially commended them. Sergeant First Class Mine Kuniji and eight others were a platoon of anti-tank guns. They had received a special cannon bestowed by the Emperor. During the Battle of Meiktila, on March 8th, they independently fired upon more than ten enemy armored vehicles, capturing ten destroyed armored vehicles and numerous artillery pieces, throwing the enemy into confusion. On the 11th, in the northwestern area of Lake Meiktila, they engaged in a courageous fight against a superior enemy force approaching the rear of the platoon, causing two enemy tanks to catch fire, thwarting the enemy's attempt. The Imperial-bestowed cannon and all members of the platoon, including the platoon leader, perished together. The entire platoon, including the platoon leader, united around the Imperial-bestowed cannon, fought bravely with sincere faith, and established outstanding achievements, truly a model for anti-tank gun units. The Imperial-bestowed cannon was bestowed by the Emperor in the wake of the Greater East Asia War, when the government was tasked with urgently increasing the production of various weapons and began collecting metals. The Emperor specially bestowed various implements for his use for the manufacture of weapons. These weapons are all engraved with the character "Bestowed," and the Japanese military units receiving these weapons are especially grateful and name them "Imperial-Bestowed Cannon."

Tokyo, 11th (Central News Agency Telegram) - According to an announcement by the Japanese Army Ministry on the 10th, two Japanese units, after fighting in the Imphal and Arakan areas of Burma, engaged in difficult operations, achieved great achievements, and were awarded commendations, which are now reported to the Emperor. The Tanaka Unit: This unit overcame great difficulties and completed rear-area mobile operations during the retreat from the Imphal operation. Formed in January of Showa 20 (1945), it maintained the key point of Myingyan during the battle along the Irrawaddy River. Under enemy air supremacy, it fought against a superior enemy armored force for more than two months, destroying the enemy forces. Since mid-February, it fought in isolation and defended its position for more than a month, making a great contribution to the overall operation. Later, it was ordered to retreat, broke through the enemy's encirclement, and took up a strategic position suitable for guiding subsequent overall operations. The Asanaga Boat Squadron: Since the enemy's invasion of Burma, this squadron was dispatched to the forefront in the Arakan area, overcoming all difficulties and engaging in mobile and assault operations. Under a comprehensive plan and command, it completed the task of diverting a large number of boats, contributing to the overall operation. Later, as the situation in Rangoon became urgent, it repeatedly broke through enemy encirclements to transfer troops and was stationed around Rangoon for a month, fully accomplishing its mission, making subsequent operations and transportation much easier.

Editorial

### Japan's Wartime Education

In recent years, in order to adapt to the urgent needs of wartime, Japan has repeatedly reformed school education. Today, the special attack forces on the front lines and the suicide squads on the production front are mostly young Japanese students. The true value of Japan's long-standing education can be said to have already been fully demonstrated in this war. However, as the flames of war increasingly press closer to the mainland, the Japanese authorities believe that the repeatedly reformed wartime education needs to be further strengthened. Therefore, the "Wartime Education Order" has recently been promulgated. It can be a stone from another mountain for our country, so we will introduce its outline as follows.

The first article of the "Wartime Education Order" promulgated by Japan this time stipulates: "Students should be loyal and shoulder the fate of the nation, dedicate themselves to the urgent tasks of wartime, so that the effects of education cultivated in peacetime can be fully demonstrated, and must devote themselves to the refinement of intelligence and fulfill their duties." The second article stipulates: "Faculty and staff should take the lead in setting an example, dedicate themselves to the urgent tasks of wartime together with students, and complete the important tasks of moral education and enlightenment of students with the spirit of learning and progressing together." These two articles have combined wartime education and dedication to the cause of defending the country into one thing, giving the education cause a new mission.

Article 3 of the Japanese Wartime Education Order stipulates: "In addition to dedicating themselves to wartime important tasks such as food production, military production, air defense and defense, and important research, for the purpose of conducting wartime emergency education and training, each school should organize student teams with faculty and staff and students, and each region should organize a federation with various student teams. When a part or all of two or more student teams dedicate themselves to the same workplace, except as stipulated by the Minister of Education, student teams should be organized with faculty and staff and students in each workplace, and federations should be organized with student teams. The necessary matters concerning student teams and their federations, such as organization, education and training, guidance and supervision, shall be stipulated by the Minister of Education." This concretely stipulates a new method of militarizing education, making education, production, and combat a trinity.

Article 4 of the Wartime Education Order stipulates: "In order to make the operation of school education adapt to the progress of the war situation, the Minister of Education may, when necessary, set special cases for educational subjects and class hours in accordance with its regulations, and take special measures for the implementation of school education." Article 5 of the same Order stipulates: "When it is especially necessary in wartime, due to the conscription or call-up of students, etc., and for soldiers (including students of the army and navy) who dedicate themselves to the urgent tasks of wartime and die or are injured, or who study wartime urgently needed specialized subjects, they may, according to the regulations of the Minister of Education, graduate (or be qualified accordingly) even if they have not studied during the regular period or have not received formal examinations." This article further enhances the powers of the Minister of Education, assigning him major tasks similar to those of generals; at the same time, it breaks the past traditional concepts of education, making everyone realize that work and combat are learning.

From this Japanese Wartime Education Order, we are given a new understanding of education, breaking the old tradition of Jiangtan education, and opening up a new national land for the practice of the educational theory of "knowing is acting, and acting is knowing," which is exactly the same as the "unity of knowledge and action" and "genuine knowledge and diligent practice" that our educational circles idealize.

In short, the new education system in Japan now makes 20 million faculty, staff, and students dedicate themselves to the cause of defending the country day and night, either in factories or in rural areas, working and teaching at the same time, raising the will to be loyal and protect the country, and jointly accomplishing the grand ideal of the Greater East Asia War.

### Integration of Production and Defense: The Character of Japan's National Volunteer Corps

Japan, in order to cope with the urgent situation of the mainland battlefield, has established a new combat-oriented national organization - the National Volunteer Corps. Currently, in various countries and regions throughout Japan, the organizational units for the practical core of the corps are progressing steadily. On the one hand, the central government, following the conference on May 12, convened a conference of local governors on the 14th, where the Prime Minister and the Minister of the Interior clarified the basic policies. Up to this point, the historical beginning of the Volunteer Corps has completed its first preparatory stage. However, because the National Volunteer Corps is a huge organization that encompasses the entire population from all walks of life, there are many issues that need to be resolved not only in terms of the immediate organizational problems, but also in terms of the healthy operation and guidance.

△ Purpose and Mission▽

The purpose and mission of the National Volunteer Corps, as stated in the organizational guidelines, are limited to the following three points:

To take the completion of one's own duties as the central concept, to take the hometown as the core, and to aim for the integration of production and defense.

The immediate task is to increase war power, such as military production and food production.

In times of crisis, immediately transform into a combat unit to serve mainly in the logistics operations required for combat, such as production, transportation, trench construction, air raid recovery, and rescue.

In other words, it is to provide a strong and organic organization to the production and defense situation, which has traditionally lacked a national foundation and is chaotic and lacks unity. In order to adapt to the situation of the mainland battlefield, it exerts "the spirit of the team members not relaxing their duties even when they fall, and the workers resolutely devoting themselves to the machines, and faithfully performing their duties with enthusiasm and dedication." The intention of establishing the Volunteer Corps is so important, so it requires each member to have a thorough understanding of the war, and to stimulate their own mission through a clear understanding and active practice.

Strict Organization

Here, the first question is: What kind of organization should fully realize the above-mentioned purpose and character? The government authorities have clearly indicated the following points on this point:

The National Volunteer Corps is a national organization with practical action as its main focus.

It is a non-bureaucratic character and must be an extremely popular and keen gathering organization.

Eliminate the casual organizational forms of general group organizations.

From this, the authorities' policy is clarified, eliminating the disadvantages of the official-made organization that has been fully tested in the Auxiliary Association and the Auxiliary Corps, etc., and making it an extremely voluntary national movement based on popular opinion. Therefore, the Auxiliary Association, the Auxiliary Corps, and most of the organizations under its scope, which are also national movement fronts, are dissolved in a developmental manner and absorbed into the National Volunteer Corps. After this adjustment, only the Dai Nippon Political Association, the only political association, remains.

This issue mostly contains elements of political issues and remains to be handled by the government in the future, but for the time being, the members of the Volunteer Corps are all nationals within a certain age limit, regardless of their occupation, status, or identity. It is currently being organized based on this policy. The members of the Dai Nippon Political Association will take the lead as a driving force for the Volunteer Corps, acting as model members and actively participating.

Capable Leaders

Secondly, the important issue regarding the rise and fall of the Volunteer Corps movement is the issue of selecting leaders. Regarding this matter, Interior Minister Abe explained the following points at the conference of local governors:

If the selection of leaders ends in a casual form from the viewpoint of the so-called balance of power in the past, it will become an organization with only a shell and no soul, and will hinder war power.

Whether the commander or the leader is suitable or not is related to the rise and fall of the organization in any organization. Especially since the National Volunteer Corps is an action team with the mission of changing into a combat unit depending on the situation, the selection of leaders is of great importance to the Corps's success or failure.

Seek talented people who are deeply trusted and have leadership skills, regardless of their past, and boldly appoint them to be willing to die under their command.

The concept of personnel selection can be largely clarified by this, but this matter is easy to say and difficult to do, and the actual issue will be an opportunity to test the local governors. That is, even though there is a wide search for talent, the Volunteer Corps is different from the Auxiliary Corps and other existing groups, and is a huge organization that commands and encompasses all walks of life, so it is easy to think of some kind of influential elder. However, these so-called elders often lack initiative, and are especially not necessarily suitable as leaders of production and defense. For example, the leaders and cadres of the Auxiliary Association and the Auxiliary Corps were not suitable, so they merely flowed into conceptual innovations, and their groups also appeared to be special existences in the nation. However, the result can be said to be the fault of the unsuitable leaders. If you want to adjust the two and get the right person, it all depends on the government's time-sensitive organization and its political skills.

Smooth Operation

The above are the main issues facing the National Volunteer Corps organization. In addition, there are problems such as continuing the important tasks undertaken by various groups and adjusting regional and occupational volunteer corps. The most important thing to be wary of at this time is the fundamental attitude of the government and the people when dealing with the above problems.

That is, the National Volunteer Corps is a combat-oriented national organization that absorbs and integrates existing national movement groups. The handling of this issue must take into account the requirements of the war situation and the actual situation of the region and the scope, and must be resolved concretely. The feeling of merely having a structure, as seen in the national movement in the past, must absolutely be eliminated. If we fall into formal measures again, the war power enhancement of the Volunteer Corps' original mission will not have a concrete solution, ensuring that we do not repeat the mistakes of the Auxiliary Association.

If so, in regional groups, the current security system must be reviewed again; in occupational groups, the concept of a production army must be deepened. Among them, the occupational groups responsible for increasing production must also have a clear understanding of a series of production enterprise countermeasures, such as the reorganization and dispersal plan for excess workers and the solution to livelihood problems. Needless to say, this is premised on the government's implementation of strong war policies.

As such, the National Volunteer Corps is a regional war city organization based on the uplifting will of the people. The government strives to retreat behind the scenes, engage in guidance, and not participate in operations, and therefore does not establish a central organization, but contrary to this policy, the government must take active action in some areas.

In short, for the strong and smooth operation of the Volunteer Corps, it is hoped that the fundamental understanding of the above points by the government and the people must be thorough. (Translated from the Yomiuri Hochi, May 19)

### Nationalist Party Sets Double Tenth Day to Convene National Congress, Adapting to the Environment to Discuss National Affairs

Nanjing, November 11th, Central News Agency Telegram: The Chinese Nationalist Party has held its Sixth National Congress in August of the 28th year of the Republic of China [1939], amended the General Constitution, determined the political program, and implemented the return to the capital for nearly six years. The Central Executive Committee held its 103rd regular meeting the day before yesterday, and in view of the seriousness of the current situation, it was decided to convene a National Provisional Congress on Double Tenth Day [October 10th] of this year. At the same time, important proposals such as the election law for the Provisional National Congress representatives were also approved.

Acting Chairman Chen Issues Statement

Acting Chairman Chen specially issued a statement clarifying the significance of convening the Congress. The original text is as follows: Since the Sixth National Congress held by our party in August of the 28th year of the Republic of China [1939], six years have passed. Under the leadership of the late Chairman Wang, all comrades of our party, based on the established party program and national policy, have made efforts to adapt to the times and save the nation. Although we have not been able to fully complete the national policy of peace, anti-communism, and national construction, and achieve the goal of the party's highest political ideals, the long-cherished wishes of our party for the past fifty years, such as abolishing extraterritorial rights, recovering concessions, and abolishing unequal treaties, have been gradually realized with the cooperation of the Allied countries and domestic figures. Unfortunately, in November of last year, our late Chairman Wang passed away due to illness caused by overwork, depriving us of the guidance of a great leader in the midst of our arduous struggle. The world situation has become increasingly serious, and the Greater East Asia War has reached its final decisive stage. In order to review past work, adapt to the current environment, and shoulder the tasks of the times, our party has specifically decided to convene a National Provisional Congress on October 10th of this year, following the precedent of convening a Provisional National Congress in Hankou after the Fifth National Congress of our party, gathering all talents within the party to discuss future national affairs and strengthen the party's leadership, urging compatriots across the country to uphold justice and curb chaos, in order to complete the great cause of the party's indivisibility and the nation's unity.

### Montgomery Broadcasts to Germans

Tokyo, November 11th, Central News Agency Telegram: According to a Reuters report received here, General Montgomery made a broadcast to the Germans in the British occupied zone last night, stating in brief that the Allied side has decided that the German people and their children should not only know that they are the people of a defeated country, but also understand that the country has committed the crime of starting the war. If they do not understand this situation, they and their children will be easily deceived by leaders and start war again. During the war, your leaders will certainly not let the people know how the people of the world feel about you. You thought that once our Allied forces stepped into Germany, it would be as if nothing had happened and you would be treated as friends, but the reality is not that simple. Many of our comrades have died at gunpoint, families have been destroyed, and wives and children are starving. Is this not caused by you? Therefore, you should make this situation deeply understood by women and tell them "Why the British soldiers don't show a trace of smile on their faces."

General Montgomery also pointed out that "the order of no friendship with Germans" will not be relaxed, and added, "You don't have to doubt why, when you wave to British soldiers or say good morning, or when your children play with them, they don't smile, because they dare not disobey the 'no friendship with Germans' order."

### CCP Arrives in Chongqing

Central News Agency News: Chen Cheng, Minister of Military and Political Affairs of Chongqing, made a statement on June 6, stating that there had been armed conflicts between the Chongqing Communist troops and emphasized that weapons leased under the US Lend-Lease Act could not be supplied to the Communist troops, and only the Chongqing troops could enjoy them. This point has attracted attention from all sides. According to a New China News Agency dispatch from Yan'an on the 9th, the CCP criticized Chen Cheng's statement that "the supply of weapons under the US Lend-Lease Act to Chongqing has recently increased significantly. I have sworn to the Allied forces that these weapons, even one gun and one bullet, will only be used in combat against the enemy. However, if the Central Army is attacked by unfriendly troops and does not use its own weapons to defend itself, it will violate human nature," criticizing this as the Chongqing army's open preparation for civil war. The content of the New China News Agency telegram briefly stated that the unfriendly troops referred to by Chen Cheng were not the Chongqing army, but the New Fourth Army and the Eighth Route Army. The Kuomintang authorities denied that they were still preparing for civil war today and claimed to seek a solution through political means and negotiation methods, but judging from Chen Cheng's remarks, this is deceptive talk. The Chongqing army has sworn to the Allied forces not to use leased weapons in civil war, but Chongqing has now removed its mask. In the last section of Chen Cheng's remarks, it has openly stated that it can use leased weapons for civil war. The Chongqing authorities' preparation for civil war has moved from secret to open statement, so if the United Nations government increases the lease of military materials, it is tantamount to helping Chongqing create civil unrest.

### Impressions of Eastern Zhejiang (II)

— Yifei

Journey to Shaoxing (Part II) Land Tax and Land

Before the incident [war], the agricultural land in Shaoxing County was approximately 800,000 mu. At that time, the collection of land tax could reach more than 85% of the total. After the incident, due to the harsh environment and the obstruction of county administration, the number of mu collected also gradually decreased. In the 31st year [1942], about 500,000 mu could be collected, in the 32nd year [1943], it had dropped to 200,000 mu, and in the 33rd year [1944], it was only more than 100,000 mu (Note: The land tax collection for the 33rd year has not yet ended). The 34th year [1945] has not yet started.

The land tax collection amount was two yuan per mu in the 31st year (during the Township Joint Association era). In the 32nd year (during the Maintenance Committee era), it was 24 yuan per mu according to the regulations of the Finance Department of the Zhejiang Provincial Government. In the 33rd year, it was changed to 40 yuan per mu. In the 34th year, it is planned to change to in-kind collection, and the amount has not yet been determined.

The Relationship Between Farmers and Landlords

According to Shaoxing, most of the farmers are tenant farmers, and self-cultivating farmers account for only one-tenth of the total number. The farmland is divided into "large fields" and "small fields". The former, the ownership of the land belongs to the large landlords. As for the relationship between the landlords and tenant farmers, the crops obtained during the "spring flower" (i.e., spring plowing) each year are all at the disposal of the tenant farmers. In addition to paying various "allocations" for the landlords, most of the remaining money is used to purchase fertilizers and seeds. During the autumn harvest, the landlords can only obtain one-sixth of the total amount of harvested crops, and the remainder is still at the disposal of the tenant farmers. The landlords have no objection to their small income because the current "allocations" and "temporary apportionments" in the countryside are very expensive, but the land tax must still be borne by the landlords.

Small fields are sublet by "dijiao" (i.e., tenant farmers) to small farmers. Although the landlords own the land, the "dijiao" have the permanent privilege of subletting. Once the landlord (i.e., the owner) sells all the land to others, the new owner cannot change the original tenant farmers' right to sublet.

Small farmers often have to pay a considerable top fee before obtaining the right to sublet from the "dijiao", which is often equal to the value of the land being sublet (Note: Currently, the price of top-grade land in Shaoxing is about 50,000 yuan, medium-grade land is about 30,000 yuan, and low-grade land is only about 20,000 yuan). As for the land rent relationship between small farmers and landlords and "dijiao" (tenant farmers), each mu must pay 60 catties of grain to the landlord each season, and 100 catties of grain to the "dijiao", and the remainder is theirs. According to the survey, the top-grade fields in Shaoxing can yield about two dan of rice per mu per season, the second-grade fields can yield about one dan and five or six dou, and the average can yield about 360 catties of grain per mu.

Shaoxing has a small land area and a large population, which has led to the formation of the small field system. The types of land include paddy fields, which account for about 50%, sandy fields (suitable for growing miscellaneous grains), which account for about 35%, and mountain fields (mostly growing miscellaneous grains and producing bamboo and wood, which are afforestation land), which account for about 15%. The output of rice accounts for about 70% of the total crop yield, and the remainder is miscellaneous grains.

Current Situation of Crops

The severe cold in the Shaoxing area last winter, although it killed the rice borers that harm crops, which was very beneficial, at the same time, the rapeseed, broad beans, and wheat that had been planted in the fields were all frozen to death. Farmers who planted slightly later in their fields also had their seeds frozen and unable to plant, resulting in considerable losses, which accounted for about 70-80%. Moreover, due to the strange damage to the "spring flowers", the farmers had no income, which affected the summer crops this year. The lack of funds, seeds, and fertilizers has created an unprecedented panic in the countryside.

Farmers' Lives and Burdens

"The village chief buys fields and buys..., the bao chief eats fish and eats meat, the jia chief is busy, and the people cry in their arms." This is a folk song in Shaoxing. In fact, this situation is not unique to Shaoxing, but is the same everywhere else.

Currently, farmers in the Shaoxing countryside are unable to bear the heavy burdens and are stopping planting. Since February of this year, the number of abandoned fields has been 6,000 mu. It has now increased to more than 10,000 mu. Moreover, the farmers' cessation of planting is a group action. If the farmers in the group violate this, the "allocations" and all kinds of burdens that the village should pay will be borne by those who plant. Under this intimidation, there are fewer and fewer planters, and the situation is very serious. If the authorities do not quickly find a way to adjust it, the future will be unimaginable.

The lives of farmers are not easy to maintain. The strong take risks, and the weak commit suicide. For example, in Shuangdu Village, Keqiao, a tragedy occurred recently in which the Zhang family of eight people committed suicide by taking poison. It is said that Zhang owned more than 50 mu of land, but he could not bear the extra demands and was robbed by the law, which caused him to be angry and take this desperate measure.

As for the situation of the farmers' burdens, in order to report accurately, the reporter went to Yuling Township, a suburb (five miles from the city), for investigation. According to the investigation, the township covers an area of about 30 li in circumference, with 12,000 mu of farmland, which is under the jurisdiction of the Gaobu District of Shaoxing. The officially stipulated allocations for the township's farmland are about 750 yuan per mu per month (delivered in three installments, but the amount is often increased). Other extra supplies (such as detectives and secret service teams) require 48 dan of rice and 128,000 yuan in cash per month. As for the "allocated rice" of the Peace District Security Team, more than 200 dan must be supplied each month. In addition, troops passing through, temporary apportionments, arbitrary additions by township and bao chiefs, and the need to deal with the surrounding evil forces, are layers of exploitation. Such heavy burdens must be borne by farmers who work hard all year round but can hardly get enough to eat, which has led to the current phenomenon of rural bankruptcy and farmers fleeing. This environment is an inevitable trend.

### Broadcasting Air Raid Information to Stabilize People's Hearts, Citizens' Air Defense Headquarters Explains Key Points

The Shanghai Japanese Army and Navy Air Defense Headquarters has issued a notice to promote the activities of people's air defense during air raids. From the 10th of this month, air defense information will be broadcast and a preparation alarm will be issued. The content is divided into four points, which were published in the newspapers on the 10th. The Citizens' Air Defense Headquarters respectfully issued a statement explaining the notice, pointing out that the first and second items in the notice are the most important. Broadcasting the enemy's air raid situation by radio can avoid confusion during air raids, eliminate rumors and enemy strategic thinking warfare, and stabilize people's hearts. Moreover, this kind of air defense information can fully exert production functions. Therefore, citizens should listen to the radio when the report is issued, and pedestrians on the road can listen to the loudspeakers set up on the street and take appropriate measures. For the sake of perfection, the Air Defense Headquarters plans to send mobile broadcasting vehicles to report news in various parts of the city. Due to the current power supply situation, citizens should make full use of crystal radios as much as possible in order to adapt to power saving and light control.

Preparation Alarms Must Be Distinguished As for the second item, "Preparation Alarm," in the past, alarms were often divided into alert and air raid. However, a preparation alarm will be added in the future. When the military authorities judge that enemy planes are attacking the vicinity of Shanghai but do not feel dangerous, a preparation alarm will be issued to make citizens pay attention and prepare. When the order is given to sound the siren, it will be a ten-second long sound and a short sound, which is represented by "——·" in the diagram. Item three of the notice clearly states that the preparation alarm may not be issued before the alert alarm. In special circumstances, an alert alarm or air raid alarm will be issued immediately. Therefore, citizens must clearly distinguish the "——·" preparation alarm. This point should be noted.

In addition, item four stipulates that air defense information is prohibited from being published in newspapers and magazines. Therefore, the Baojia organizations must destroy the information recorded for the purpose of transmitting orders after the alarm is lifted.

### Shanghai Office of the Japanese Embassy Strengthens Internal Structure, Newly Established Police Department Governs Four Sections

### Housing Rental Disputes: First Mediation Session Held on the 19th

Following the National Government's promulgation of the "Wartime Housing Rental Dispute Resolution Act" on April 11th of this year, the Shanghai Municipal Social Welfare Bureau, acting on instructions from the Municipal Government and the Ministry of Social Welfare, established a "Housing Rental Dispute Mediation Committee" in accordance with Article 4 of the aforementioned act. Hu Shouqi, the former Chief Secretary of the Bureau, was appointed as the Chairman of the Mediation Committee. Qian Da Kui, a judge recommended by the Shanghai Local Court, and Yuan Ludeng, the Chairman of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, were appointed as committee members. The committee commenced operations on May 1st. When handling housing rental dispute cases, the committee first conducts preliminary investigations and solicits opinions, then encourages the disputing parties to reach a settlement. If repeated attempts at reconciliation fail, the Mediation Committee will convene a meeting to summon both parties for verbal debate. The Mediation Committee will then decide on a resolution, and the mediation document will be delivered to both parties for compliance. If a disputing party receives the aforementioned mediation document and disagrees with the resolution or cannot accept it, they must raise an objection within ten days; otherwise, the mediation is deemed established, and the other party may apply to the court for compulsory enforcement. If one of the disputing parties raises an objection, they may file a lawsuit with the court within one month. Article 17 of the Resolution Act stipulates that disputing parties who engage in the following acts during the mediation period shall be subject to a fine of up to 5,000 yuan: Landlords who close the housing or use other methods to obstruct the tenant's residence; Tenants who damage the housing and its attached property; Those who fail to attend the hearing without legitimate reason. The aforementioned fines shall be determined by the Mediation Committee based on the severity of the circumstances, and the party concerned shall be notified to pay within a specified period. It is also learned that the committee has scheduled its first mediation committee meeting for 2:00 PM on June 19th. It is expected that all rental disputes in the city will be fairly resolved at that time.

### Marine Art Exhibition: Awards Ceremony Held Yesterday, Nine Chinese and Japanese Artists Selected

The first Marine Art Exhibition of the Shanghai Branch of the Chinese News Association, sponsored by the Press Department of the Japanese Fleet in China and the International Cultural Promotion Association, and with the enthusiastic participation of Chinese and Japanese painters in the city, has been successfully concluded.

### Construction Bureau Plans to Dig Large Earth Wells

In response to the urgent need for water among citizens and to prevent any unforeseen circumstances, the Municipal Construction Bureau plans to first dig a number of earth wells in areas relatively far from the river. All drawings and plans have been drafted and construction will commence soon. Furthermore, as many citizens have recently been digging wells, the results are often unsatisfactory. The reasons for this are mainly that the owners are greedy for cheapness, the contractors are perfunctory, there is no guidance or supervision, and well-digging is not handled by contractors registered with the bureau. In order to rectify this situation, the bureau has specially drafted various earth well excavation drawings. In the future, citizens who have any inquiries about well-digging matters can contact the Second Section of the bureau at any time.

### An Appeal from an Impoverished Scholar

According to a letter from an impoverished scholar: "I make a living as a teacher, but I have many children, and we eat three meals of porridge a day. I rely on pawns and loans to make ends meet. Recently, the cost of living has increased dramatically, and I have exhausted all means. It is difficult to continue. I have no choice but to find humble jobs for my two eldest daughters. The eldest daughter graduated from a higher normal school, and the second daughter graduated from junior high school. If there are any teaching positions available that provide accommodation, I will not consider the salary. I also humbly request charitable organizations to foster and educate my four and five sons. I saw an advertisement in the newspaper that it only costs several thousand yuan to adopt a child. If it is less than 10,000 yuan, I will do my best to make do and fulfill my duty. I only ask for someone to take care of them. If anyone lacks children and can afford to raise and educate them, I am willing to give them away unconditionally." If there are any kind people who can provide assistance, please write to the Social Services Department of this newspaper for forwarding.
