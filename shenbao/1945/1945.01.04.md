### Prospects for the Current Stage of the War (4) - Roundtable Discussion by the Chiefs of the Shanghai Japanese Army, Navy, and Foreign Correspondents' Bureaus

The Terror of the Kamikaze Attack Squad

Matsudaira: There is also the matter of researching and manufacturing new weapons. Past orders and adjustments of old weapons are being canceled and new ones ordered, which has led to a slight decline in military supply production. However, they haven't said a word about the Kamikaze Special Attack Squad and the Commando Airborne Unit, even though they suffered considerable losses.

Matsushima: Only one foreign military attaché mentioned that the enemy suffered significant damage from the Kamikaze Special Attack Squad of the Army and Navy. Only that, nothing more.

Matsudaira: If they say it, it would be troublesome. If it is reported, it will dampen morale.

Matsushima: Regarding the recent issue of the balance of naval power between Britain and the United States, Britain recently announced that it has launched the world's number one battleship. The reason Britain wants to announce this is to counteract the United States.

Matsushima: However, the enemy has been cornered by our offensive, so they are carrying out guerrilla-style bombings of Japanese military supply production zones or air raids on Shanghai. We Japanese people are naturally aware of the indiscriminate bombing by enemy aircraft. What is the psychology of the people who have been victimized by the indiscriminate bombing in Japan and Shanghai recently? Do you know? According to reports from the press, Shanghai is quite resentful about this. Until now, the people thought that there would be no indiscriminate bombing, but recently bombs were dropped in the refugee areas, so they are very hateful.

Ideyoshi: After the bombing of Shanghai, I heard that the leading figures on the Chinese side were furious. Very angry. It is said that if there is such indiscriminate bombing, they will take counter measures.

Matsudaira: Therefore, we should be aware of the enemy's guerrilla-style air raids. The best defense against this is defensive combat, followed by complete air defense facilities.

Matsushima: In short, we must increase the number of air defense aircraft and find ways to limit the damage area to the location where the bombs fall as much as possible. The evacuation of important facilities and the dispersed storage of materials are necessary. Recently, the enemy's broadcasts regarding the air raids on the 11th and 21st were quite detailed. They were broadcast from Yan'an or Shandong. According to the broadcast, "It is best for Matsushima, the head of the Shanghai Naval Press Department, not to run to high places to watch during air raids." From this, we can see that their intelligence is quite detailed.

Matsudaira: In the past, I heard that enemy personnel infiltrated the Hankou area and launched rockets as signals during air raids. We must be very vigilant about this...

Matsushima: There are many orders. They order the guerrillas to investigate in detail where there are factories, where there are warehouses, where materials are stored, and instruct them to mark them with something.

Matsudaira: Not long ago, there was intelligence that 50 or 60 of these staff members had been sent to the area. In short, in addition to guerrilla warfare, plots and propaganda warfare are also quite active. Now, the Greater East Asia War has entered its fourth year, and the decisive battle phase will reach its final stage this year, won't it?

Matsushima: This year will probably be decisive. The war will continue, but there will be a conclusion.

Ideyoshi: Now let's take a look at the domestic situation in the United States. Yesterday I received a telegram. According to a communication dated November 25th, the US Director of Selective Service stated in his military lecture on the 22nd - I don't know if it was a military lecture or what - that the number of people exempted from military service since the beginning of the war has reached 1.44 million. Also, a July 3rd article in "Life" magazine, titled "The Problem of the Treatment of Veterans Exempted from Military Service," stated that the United States had exempted more than 1.25 million people from military service.

Matsudaira: In Britain, the number of people exempted from military service accounts for one-eighth of the number called up.

Enemy Mobilizes Maximum Military Force

Ideyoshi: The US Director of Selective Service also stated that the total number of military personnel in the United States on October 1st was 11.85 million. This mobilized military force is all able-bodied men. If the US population is calculated at 120 million, the ratio to the total population is 10 to 1, meaning that one in five men has been called up.

Matsudaira: However, the 120 million includes black people.

Ideyoshi: In short, it can be said that the mobilized military force has reached its maximum limit. If we consider the attrition rate of the mobilized military force and the problem of the atmosphere of peace generated by the view of victory in the country, we can easily imagine that the atmosphere in the United States of ending the war as soon as possible is quite strong. Therefore, in this fourth year, they will not hesitate to sacrifice on the mainland or in the Pacific. In short, in this fourth year, the Greater East Asia War will present the appearance of the greatest decisive battle. The current air raids on Japan are just one aspect of this. The bombing of various locations on the continent will certainly become more intense.

Editorial

### New Municipal Administration and New Personnel

Since the National Government announced the change of the municipal administrator, the general public has had high expectations. The Executive Yuan meeting the other day also approved the candidates for the heads of the municipal police, finance, economy, public works, and supplies distribution bureaus. This gave the people of Shanghai a refreshing impression.

Standing in the position of the citizens of Shanghai, we naturally have a cooperative attitude toward local officials. Unless the local official cannot fulfill his responsibilities, this cooperative attitude will naturally be affected and turn into a distant attitude. It is said that the bureau chiefs who have been transferred to Shanghai are all individuals with rich administrative experience and relatively disciplined integrity. Therefore, we naturally express our welcome and gratification, and at the same time, we place great expectations on them.

However, our welcome and gratification are not for the new figures, but for their ability to fulfill their responsibilities as local officials. How do they fulfill their responsibilities as local officials? We have repeatedly pointed out the current situation in Shanghai and the urgent issues to be resolved, which are sufficient to provide the various bureau chiefs with reference. After the bureau chiefs take office, they may make some adjustments to the personnel under their jurisdiction for the sake of administrative efficiency. We would like to briefly state our views as follows:

First, in any organization, while the leader is in an important position, the cadre personnel who are responsible for the actual execution of the work are equally important. For example, public officials at the section chief level inherit the leader's policy and instruct subordinates to implement it, while understanding the intentions of superiors and making every effort to promote it, and being familiar with the abilities of subordinates and properly managing them. They are cautious and responsible to superiors and lead by example to subordinates. The speed and slowness, thoroughness and omissions of the implementation of government orders depend entirely on the talents of the section chief level. Therefore, their abilities and integrity are extremely important. We hope that special care is taken in the selection of these cadres. At the same time, incompetent personnel should be eliminated and existing competent personnel should be guaranteed to reassure them so they can serve.

Second, create an excellent atmosphere for public officials to serve the municipality. We hope that public officials will, from now on, regard serving the government as running their own business and work actively. Zeng Guofan said: "What does the customs depend on? It is only in the hearts of one or two people." The creation of this atmosphere should be from top to bottom. If the various bureau chiefs can lead by example, the cadre personnel at the section chief level will have a unified belief, and thus the atmosphere will form. With such an atmosphere, we believe that it is not difficult to bring politics back on track. Secondly, there are too many redundant personnel in various agencies, which is an undeniable fact. These so-called redundant personnel either do not know how to do things or have nothing to do, and just fill the numbers. Not only do they not help the work, but they also hinder it. We hope to identify and eliminate as many of them as possible, and at the same time, save money to improve the treatment of general cadres.

Third, generally speaking, capable people will not be idle and doing nothing, while those who are always seeking advancement are usually lacking in ability. Therefore, in order to ensure that the right person is in the right job, one should always look for them and not just be swayed by emotions and casually hire people who are recommended. We have previously suggested that there are many truly capable talents in the city's well-established and successful organizations and groups. We should entrust them with the task of investigating and searching for them, and solicit them for temporary use, and thoroughly implement the principle of using people based on their talents.

### Thai Prime Minister Broadcasts

Bangkok, 3rd (Central News Agency dispatch) - Thai Prime Minister Abhaiwongse made a special New Year's exchange broadcast at 7:20 AM on the 3rd, with the gist as follows: On this New Year, the hearts of the people must be focused on the war. In order to complete the war goal, we must gather the total strength of the people. Thinking of the glorious achievements that the Japanese army has achieved since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, we are confident that the belief in victory of all the Japanese people will be renewed. We have always maintained close and friendly relations with the Japanese people. Now that we have become allies with Japan, we deeply understand Japan's noble ideal of fighting for the freedom and prosperity of all countries and ethnic groups in Greater East Asia. The Thai government and people are determined to provide the greatest cooperation in accordance with the alliance treaty. On this auspicious day, we, the Thai people, sincerely pray for the victory of Japan. In my capacity as a Thai national, I sincerely pray for the victory of the Japanese army and the increasing prosperity of the Japanese Empire.

### German Embassy Military Attaché Discusses the Recent Situation in the European War, and the Belief in Victory Remains Firm

Nanjing, 3rd (Central News Agency dispatch) - German Ambassador to China Wörmann held a tea party at his residence at No. 5 Ninghai Road at 5:00 PM on the 3rd, inviting journalists from the capital, including Fan Fuliang, Director of the European and American Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the National Government, Li Jie, Assistant to the Guidance Division of the Propaganda Department, Li Zhuosheng, Chief of the Fifth Section of the Military Affairs Department of the General Affairs Office of the Military Affairs Commission, Gui Gao, Chief of the Sixth Section, and Kiichi Kishi, Director of the Intelligence Department of the Japanese Embassy, as well as more than 40 reporters from Chinese, Japanese, and German news agencies and newspapers. Ambassador Wörmann first gave a welcome speech, followed by a speech by Military Attaché Major Laihede on the recent situation in the European War, detailing the recent German counter-offensive on the Western Front. After the speech, Ambassador Wörmann expressed his deep gratitude to the Chinese and Japanese press and news organizations and the media for their sympathy for Germany's efforts in the war and strongly stated that Germany had unshakable confidence in the final victory of the war. The meeting ended in a warm atmosphere after 6:00 PM.

The speech of Military Attaché Lai is recorded as follows: It has been almost eight weeks since the Ambassador last hosted reporters on November 10th. I mentioned last time that Germany needs a war that allows it to gain ample time so that the personnel and equipment arrangements in Germany's total mobilization of the people can be thoroughly implemented, and to enter a new situation through a war that gains time. However, the deployment of total mobilization of the people has not yet been completed, and the manufacture of new weapons especially requires a lot of time and work to unleash their power. The enemy's superior material power has reached a turning point, and Germany's military can move from defensive to offensive and engage in offensive warfare. When the German army launched a strong attack on December 16, it was in a state of panic, and the German army was extremely excited in all aspects and in the rear, and even our allied nations were extremely happy. On the Western Front, the German army fought hard, and the enemy finally gradually approached and even entered the German border in several places. Although this can be considered progress, it did not achieve a decisive effect. (To be continued)

How to lend and retrieve textbooks to students who need them for review during the holidays should also be handled carefully by each school. It is reported that the Education Bureau has drafted regulations on the use, storage, and management of textbooks by each school and submitted them to the Municipal Government for referral to the Ministry of Education for review. Once the instructions arrive at the Bureau, it will notify each school to comply.

Reader's Scholarship News

### Reader's Letter Suggests Each Industry Should Sponsor a Team - Rapidly Raise Funds to Complete the Mission

Yesterday, this newspaper received a letter from Mr. Lei, a clerk in a money exchange, which is transcribed below: "I am an employee of the money exchange industry. This semester, my children received scholarships from your organization, for which I am deeply grateful. Currently, because life is slightly more comfortable, I do not intend to apply again starting from the next semester. However, I still do not have the ability to help others! Recently, I saw your newspaper's initiative to launch a special fundraising team, which is a good idea and a good intention. In today's time of low currency value, 20,000 yuan per team is actually easy to raise. Upon investigation, there are no less than five or six hundred large and small banks and money exchanges in our industry. If each company could establish a team, the total would be over 10 million yuan. The managers of various banks and money exchanges, although not lacking in enlightened individuals, are mostly apprentices from the marketplace, with a strong sense of selfishness. Often, after being a manager for one or two years, their homes are filled with servants and their fingers are adorned with sparkling diamond rings, but they do not care about the lives of their colleagues, let alone considering the youth who are out of school in society. Therefore, I believe that if you want to solicit donations from them, you should first appeal to the seniors in the banking industry, and the association should send letters of persuasion. If various banks and money exchanges ignore this, then your newspaper should send letters of urging, explaining the great righteousness. This will be beneficial to the future of scholarships. Please consider whether this is feasible."

After reading Mr. Lei's letter, we have a few opinions: (1) Mr. Lei's children also received scholarships last semester. Recently, due to improved family finances, he voluntarily gave up the scholarships. This spirit is very admirable! We hope that the parents of some scholarship recipients can also express the same. The most hateful thing is that people who can afford it still apply for scholarships, occupying the slots of truly impoverished students. There are also those who were very poor before, but their family finances have gradually improved in recent years, and they still refuse to give up scholarships. This is unethical behavior. We hope that the schools will carefully consider this when making recommendations, and students can do their best to report such cases. (2) Mr. Lei said that each bank and money exchange can at least establish one team, which is the same as our suggestion a few days ago. Unfortunately, not many banks and money exchanges have responded. We wonder what their psychology is? (3) Mr. Lei said that the managers of many banks and money exchanges have selfish views due to their origins, which is indeed the case. Otherwise, why are they so indifferent to social welfare when their own and their families' enjoyment is so extravagant? (4) The fundraising methods mentioned in the letter are reasonable, but the purpose of this newspaper is that each person should do their best to contribute according to their wishes. We want to promote "helping joyfully as conditions allow" and do not want to force donations. We sincerely hope that people from all walks of life will donate willingly, as much as possible, for the sake of society and the country, for their own future, and for the sake of accumulating merit for future generations!

Application Forms Limited for Collection After Tomorrow

This office previously notified the authorities of large, medium, and small schools to collect and return the registration certificates received in the previous session, with which the application forms and student status certificates for the eighth session will be issued. The application forms are now fully equipped, and it is hoped that the principals of large, medium, and small schools will send personnel to collect them from the office based on the receipts issued by this office within the next two days (5th and 6th). Please complete the names and numbers according to the instructions, and then distribute them to the scholarship recipients for careful completion. The schools should then fill out the recommendation letters and return them to this office by January 15th at the latest for processing. As for the student status certificates, they should be properly preserved and sent to this office in person after approval to be stamped with a seal to show seriousness. Universities can have the receipts submitted by representatives of the scholarship student fellowship for collection. Also, applications for the eighth session are temporarily limited to old students who received scholarships in the previous session. New students should postpone the application. Students of each school are requested to pay attention.

Women's Table Tennis Finals to Benefit Scholarships

The Zhengxing Cup First Shanghai Women's Individual Table Tennis Championship, organized by Zhengxing Women's Middle School, has been scheduled for the finals at 2:00 PM on the 7th of this month at the Lu Army Dormitory sports hall on Jing'an Temple Road. The team table tennis champion Lianyi (He Ren) has also been invited to compete against the Shanghai United Team to increase the interest of the guests. According to Mr. Chen Linsheng, the chairman of the cup competition, the finals will feature a unique event in which He Ren (Lianyi) will compete against the Shanghai United Team for the first time since the incident. The program is exciting and rare, and it will surely be a sensation in the city. In response to the scholarship campaign of the Shenbao and Xinbao newspapers, and to limit the number of attendees, the organizing committee will present one downstairs admission ticket to those who donate 200 yuan to the scholarship fund of the Shenbao and Xinbao newspapers, and one upstairs admission ticket to those who donate 100 yuan. Each type of admission ticket is limited to 500. (Donations can be made at the school at 162 Luoyang Road from today, and admission tickets will be presented on the spot.) The school's colleagues are public-spirited and enthusiastic about scholarships, for which I express my admiration. The admission tickets have been stamped by both the Shenbao and Xinbao newspapers to show seriousness.

### Group A Football Match Yesterday - Donghua Defeats Huatong - 4 to 0, a One-Sided Affair

The Group A football match between Donghua and Huatong was held at Jiaozhou Park at 3:00 PM yesterday. Donghua easily defeated Huatong 4 to 0. Dai Linjing did not appear, and the newcomer Lin Dianyi took his place and performed well. The Huatong forwards were like scattered troops, each attacking on their own. The defense line still had something to be desired. A powerful shot hit the crossbar and went out. Donghua attacked again, and Han Longmei circled around and approached the enemy's formation. Chen Xiaoping turned danger into safety. Donghua launched another attack. Feng Shoupeng pushed someone in a hurry, and a penalty kick was awarded. Sun Jinshun missed. Donghua persevered, and Jia Youliang passed to Sun Jinshun. Sun pulled his leg and shot fiercely. Qin Bigao was caught off guard, and the ball went into the net. Huatong conceded a goal in the first half. After the break, the Huatong players were exhausted after a long battle, while Donghua was full of energy. Within two minutes, Han Longhai calmly scored. Not long after, Jia Youliang passed skillfully to Lin Dianyi. Lian Xiaoping could not return to defend in time, and Lin scored from the right corner. In the 30th minute, Tan Fujun intercepted the ball and shot from 20 yards away. The ball bounced off the crossbar, and Han Longhai jumped up and headed it in. As a result, Donghua defeated Huatong 4 to 0.
