### Japanese Prime Minister Issues Statement Reaffirming Belief in Victory, Expressing Deep Sympathy for the Fighting German People

Tokyo, 3rd (Central News Agency) - Due to the death of German leader Hitler and the changes in the European situation, Japanese Prime Minister General Suzuki issued the following statement at 5 pm on the 3rd: "The war situation is unfavorable to Germany, and leader Hitler has also passed away. This is known to all citizens. However, Germany and the Japanese Empire are both enemies of Britain and the United States, so the unfavorable situation of Germany is deeply regrettable. The German people have spared no sacrifice for five years and six months, fighting bravely and skillfully. We express our deep sympathy for this. In contrast, the people of the Japanese Empire, at this crucial time, should embrace a new and firm resolve. The purpose of the Empire's war has been clearly stated in the declaration of war, which is entirely for the Empire's self-preservation and self-defense. The Empire is at a critical moment of survival, and resorting to arms is a last resort. However, the threat to the Empire from Britain and the United States, and their aggression against East Asia, has been going on for a long time, and everyone knows it. Moreover, the preservation of the Empire and the liberation of East Asia are fundamentally the same principle. From this point of view, the war aims of the Empire and the countries of East Asia are initially the same and deeply related. Now, due to the situation in Germany, the Empire's position and responsibility in East Asia are felt to be even more difficult. However, the purpose of our country's war is based on the great principle of human justice, and based on morality, we want to build a new order of coexistence and co-prosperity in Greater East Asia and the whole world. Therefore, the faith of our people will not be shaken by the sudden changes in the European war situation. On the contrary, in order to complete the Greater East Asia War, the Empire's government is even more determined. Needless to say, in order to save our unblemished imperial land and the countries of Greater East Asia, and to permanently prevent them from being trampled on by foreign enemies, such an unprecedentedly heavy responsibility has been placed on our shoulders. I (Prime Minister Suzuki referring to himself) firmly believe that in this extraordinary time, all of our 100 million compatriots will share this aspiration, and will demonstrate the true Japanese spirit, awaken from now on, unite as one, and repel the arrogant enemy. Our country (i.e., Japan) has made all preparations, the three services of the army, navy, and air force are integrated, able to display the wonderful art of warfare, and we are confident that the divine opportunity to capture the enemy will surely descend. However, jade must be carved to become a vessel. No matter how difficult the national crisis may be, if we cherish loyalty, then as long as the people exist, there will be a way to restore our heavenly mission. I (Prime Minister Suzuki) what more needs to be said about the war? It is hoped that the people will be like the special attack warriors on the front line, with the spirit and hope of 'one person building the nation', strive forward, the holy virtue of the Emperor is above, the divine spirits of our ancestors are in heaven, may they all bear witness. Moreover, this European change was by no means unpredictable for us. I take this opportunity to reiterate my belief in victory to both domestic and foreign audiences."

### Minister Matsushima Writes Article in Memory of Mussolini, Extolling His Lifetime Achievements

Colonel Matsushima, Press Officer of the Allied Japanese Fleet stationed in China, has written an article in memory of Italian Prime Minister Mussolini. The content is as follows: "London Broadcasting stated that Prime Minister Mussolini passed away on the evening of the 28th. This was a transmission of news from Milan. According to the broadcast, Prime Minister Mussolini and his 18 party members were executed by firing squad in the Donggua area near Milan. Their bodies were exposed in the central parade ground of Milan. Among them were Fascist Party Secretary-General Babrini and former Secretary-General Scorza, as well as three other national members. We have great doubts about such cruel behavior. Prime Minister Mussolini spent 20 years building the country, making Italy a prosperous nation, and enhancing the honor and happiness of its people. His efforts were highly praised by both allies and enemies. Now, with his sword broken and arrows exhausted, he was captured by guerrillas and ultimately died. This is a great tragedy in history. Regarding this matter, The New York Times disregarded its position as a world news organization and commented, 'Normal behavior.' This proves that the United States, in order to dominate the world, disregards 'justice' and 'purity'. A person's unfortunate end in life is not necessarily related to his life's work. Great philosophers have died tragically, such as Christ. Also like Socrates, and in Japan, Yoshida ShÅin, there are countless such philosophers. However, as long as justice and loyalty exist in the world, such an unfortunate end will have a brilliant flower. The ending of Prime Minister Mussolini can add even more splendor to this flower. From the standpoint of loving and protecting people, we express our utmost respect for Mr. Mussolini's death."

### Q&A on Population Evacuation

Q: During wartime, it is inevitable that cities will be subjected to enemy air raids. Our city is no exception. However, to reduce casualties, it is necessary to implement population evacuation as quickly as possible. After the establishment of the evacuation committee in our city, how will the work be carried out? We would appreciate it if you could provide more detailed information.

A: Since its establishment on February 23rd, the Evacuation Committee has been officially working since March 1st. At its second meeting on March 7th, it was decided to establish specialized committees for sea and land routes to actively plan and promote evacuation work. Later, on March 19th, representatives of charitable organizations were convened to discuss the first plan for the evacuation of charitable organizations. On the 20th, representatives of hometown associations were convened to discuss ways for hometown associations to assist in evacuation. Furthermore, on March 25th, a special commissioner was sent to Suzhou to visit the Governor of Jiangsu Province to request the province's assistance in evacuation and to discuss specific measures. Various sectors have also responded one after another, recognizing the need to actively promote population evacuation.

Q: However, judging from the current actual situation, the number of people actually evacuated in Shanghai is probably not large. What are the reasons for the current poor evacuation results?

A: Insufficient awareness of evacuation among the general public is indeed one of the reasons hindering evacuation, but the main reason lies in the failure to achieve "convenient transportation." The evacuation of the population in Tokyo was able to achieve its ideal goal in a very short period of time, because of the effective transportation arrangements and the organization of the people. The success of population evacuation in Hong Kong in the past was also due to the availability of sufficient transportation. Therefore, obtaining transportation is a prerequisite for completing evacuation work.

Q: So, the current delay in evacuation work is due to the difficulty in obtaining transportation? How can this difficulty be solved?

A: The fundamental principle must be to give evacuees special conveniences that are different from those of general travelers. However, at present it is wartime, and military transportation is frequent. The difficulty of transportation cannot be ignored. Therefore, long-distance evacuation above Nanjing can only use railways. For evacuation destinations below Nanjing, land routes should use highways as much as possible, and sea routes should use chartered ships as the main means, supplemented by sailboats and civilian ships.

Q: Some people believe that the Evacuation Committee has failed to provide the general public with practical conveniences in evacuation. Why can't it purchase train and ship tickets on their behalf?

A: The Evacuation Committee is limited by its environment and capacity, so it has to adopt a focused approach, roughly prioritizing charitable organizations, schools, factories, and hometown associations. Therefore, the first step is to assist charitable organizations in evacuation. As for purchasing train and ship tickets on their behalf, this is not the entire work of the committee, and there are too many malpractices, so it is not appropriate to start.

Q: Since the evacuation work focuses on charitable organizations and other entities, is the evacuation of individuals and families the second step in the plan?

A: According to our observation, the evacuation of individuals and families may be the second step in the plan, but due to the factual difficulties in transportation, the Evacuation Committee may not be able to assist them for the time being. Therefore, individuals and families who are evacuating are advised to implement it independently without waiting for the Evacuation Committee's plan to be realized. The biggest difficulties for individuals and families to evacuate are transportation and economic problems. Now the local authorities in this city are advocating the establishment of a special "evacuation subsidy," which is a very good idea, and it is hoped that all sectors will pay attention and cooperate.

Q: Even if the evacuation work adopts a focused approach, it must have practical work performance. What is the current progress of the work?

A: Since the Evacuation Committee began working, it has focused on planning transportation work, so it has set up special committees for sea and land routes. For sea routes, the original plan was to use four money (shipping routes) to Ningbo, Jiangbei, Suzhou and Hangzhou. In addition to sailboats and civilian ships, it was originally planned to rent chartered ships from shipping companies, but in fact it is extremely difficult to do so. Now it is fully planning to rent sailboats and civilian ships; On the land route, we are contacting transportation and automobile industries to collect and rent vehicles for travel, in order to realize it as soon as possible.

### Japanese Military Supply Convenient, War Situation Shape Favorable, Minister Matsushima Talks About Battle of Okinawa

Minister Matsushima of the Allied Japanese Fleet Press Office, yesterday afternoon at the Shuijiaoshe, as usual, received reporters, including Captain Matsumoto and many reporters from various newspapers. First, Minister Matsushima elaborated on the battle situation on Okinawa, and the Japanese military special attack team established special merits, and the war situation has definitely improved. Next, he described the future of the San Francisco Conference and China and the recent situation in Europe. The following is a summary of the outline:

Enemy Supplementing Without Any Guarantee

The Japanese army continues to attack enemy naval forces near Okinawa Island, regardless of the adverse weather conditions. Since April 27th, the Japanese army has been increasing its attack force. As of April 28th, the Japanese army has sunk and damaged more than 470 enemy ships, and at least 80% of the combat ships have been lost. According to Japanese reconnaissance on May 1st, the enemy mobile unit southeast of Okinawa is composed of five regular and special aircraft carriers, five battleships, several cruisers, and about ten destroyers, assisting land operations, and the enemy's naval attack power has been greatly reduced. At present, it seems that there is no guarantee in terms of replenishment. The Japanese army is operating smoothly. The reason for this is, as the enemy has announced, due to the effective attacks by the special attack team, the Kamikaze Special Attack Team, and the Marine Corps Special Attack Team, and on the enemy side, as far as replenishment is concerned, only some progress has been made in the Makiminato area on the west coast and a part of the east coast, and it has always been in a state of confrontation. In order to reverse the difficult situation, the enemy has transferred its naval air power to the land, so some aircraft have participated in land battles, but this unit has failed to achieve its aid purpose due to the preemptive strike by the Japanese army. At present, the Pacific war situation, centered on Okinawa, is favorable because the Japanese military is convenient for replenishment, and at the same time, it can take advantage of the terrain, plus the extraordinary efforts of the front line and the rear, so we believe that there is an absolute possibility for the improvement of the war situation.

Enemy United States Carries Out Strategy Propaganda

Recently, according to enemy announcements, the enemy naval forces near Okinawa sank their hospital ship, etc. The enemy is using this to publicize it, which is a kind of strategic propaganda. If it is as the enemy said, this ship can be recognized as a hospital ship even at night, then the Japanese special attack team will never hit it. The Japanese special attack team is not as high as American aircraft, and will never blindly bomb in low-altitude flight. The United States is widely spreading this, nothing more than taking advantage of the San Francisco Conference to carry out its strategy propaganda. Another reason why the United States uses this as a propaganda is that the results of the Japanese military's special attack team have been severely criticized by American public opinion. In order to suppress this criticism, it deliberately expanded the propaganda to arouse enemy indignation. The US military has repeatedly attacked Japanese hospital ships. Recently, there was the incident of the sinking of the Awa Maru. In order to reduce scrutiny, the Americans also use this as a propaganda. The enemy uses the San Francisco Conference to focus the world's attention on this point, and takes this opportunity to conceal its unprecedented major damage at sea. The Japanese military, with planned combat steps, discerned its trickery and crushed its strategy. The enemy destroyed many hospitals and patients in Tokyo and Osaka, and it is amazing that they would use this kind of action for this kind of propaganda.

Britain and the United States Attempt to Dominate China

Next, Minister Matsushima elaborated on the future of China, saying that the most important issues at this San Francisco Conference are: â  the management of colonies, â¡ the peace mechanism of the new world. In the atmosphere of this conference, there is a subtle relationship between Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union, especially the conflict over the ideals of the United States, which has been clearly revealed among the three countries. I believe that this conference will soon fail based on the transition of the European war situation. What we should consider most about the intentions of Britain and the United States is whether Chongqing or China can be saved in the future under the intentions of Britain and the United States. This is a big question. One of the reasons why Britain and the United States are courting Chongqing this time is not based on the current strength of Chongqing, but on using Chongqing to fight against Japan. In short, it is very obvious that the United States will dominate China politically, economically, or militarily after the war. Song Ziwen has publicly stated that in the future, China's sovereignty can be partially entrusted to the world. Therefore, the Chinese people should know the true intentions of Britain and the United States. In order to achieve their own goals, Britain and the United States will not hesitate to use Chinese land and Chinese people. Chinese people should especially recognize this clearly.

Europe Experiences Food Panic

Finally, regarding Europe, Minister Matsushima said that due to Germany's relationship, a new phenomenon has occurred, that is, 700,000 British and American troops and 4 million Soviet troops are surrounding the Elbe Lake area, creating a subtle relationship. At the same time, the relationship between France and the so-called liberated countries has become a problem. On March 30, 5,000 prisoners in Paris demanded food through diplomatic means, and Lyon was in the same situation. The Dutch government in exile can only maintain food for three months. British Deputy Prime Minister Attlee said that the difficulty of the food problem is even greater than that of the East and West fronts. Therefore, the food problem in Europe is very noteworthy. As for the European crisis, due to the subtle relationship changes between Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union, there is a great possibility that an unprecedented world problem will occur again. The most serious food problem will inevitably create a second flood panic in the Noah era, which is a cause for concern for the future of mankind.

### Japanese Submarine Force Sinks Enemy Warships; Enemy Offensive on Okinawa Island Frustrated

A Certain Base in the Southwestern Islands, 3rd Dispatch of the Central News Agency â On the morning of the 2nd, the Japanese submarine force encountered a group of enemy warships in the sea east of the Ryukyu Islands, launching a fierce attack and sinking a large transport ship and two destroyers. Furthermore, on the 2nd, the Japanese military base on the front lines of the Ryukyu Islands was only attacked by about forty or fifty enemy aircraft, lacking the intensity of previous assaults.

A Certain Base in the Southwestern Islands, 2nd Dispatch of the Central News Agency â Enemy forces in the southern part of Okinawa Island have been fiercely attacking the Japanese army since the 25th, but due to the brave counterattacks by the Japanese army, they have suffered considerable casualties. The enemy's offensive has been thwarted again, and they appear to be preparing for the next phase of their attack. Therefore, considering the entire battle line, there are no major changes apart from localized battles. In the central sector, the enemy forces mobilized part of their troops, supported by tanks, and advanced into Japanese positions on the 2nd, but were ultimately repelled by the Japanese army, suffering heavy losses. In addition, on the west coast, the enemy's actions have not been very aggressive, and they are currently transporting ammunition and supplies in preparation for an attack. On the 2nd, a portion of the enemy forces advanced into a small bay about one kilometer west of the city, and are currently being surrounded by the Japanese army.

Enemy Warships Around Okinawa Decrease

Southern Frontline Base, 2nd Dispatch of the Central News Agency â The Japanese army's frontline units on Okinawa Island are bravely counterattacking across the entire line, killing an average of over 1,000 enemy soldiers daily. At the same time, the Japanese Navy and Air Force Special Attack Units are continuously launching fierce attacks, inflicting increasingly heavy blows on the main force of the enemy fleet. As of mid-April, the enemy's mobile units, including the British fleet, totaled about seven teams. However, according to reconnaissance on the 27th of last month, the number had decreased to four teams in the sea southeast of Okinawa Island and south of Miyako Island. The aircraft carriers operating in the surrounding seas, including converted aircraft carriers, totaled about a dozen or so. However, in addition to these mobile units, there are still a considerable number of warships for direct landing. On the 1st of this month, there were two battleships, four cruisers, nine destroyers, twenty transport ships, fifty landing craft, and over thirty other boats in the waters off Kadena. Furthermore, according to intelligence, the enemy has deployed old and outdated warships from France, Italy, and the Netherlands to replenish their losses.

### Count Schwerin von Krosigk Delivers Speech to German People on Eve of Appointment as German Foreign Minister

Stockholm, Sweden, 3rd Dispatch of the Central News Agency â According to a broadcast from Hamburg Radio, Count Schwerin von Krosigk will be appointed Foreign Minister to succeed Joachim von Ribbentrop. Krosigk is the former Finance Minister. As of now, Ribbentrop has not been given a new appointment. Krosigk's speech to the German people last night expressed open hatred for Bolshevism. He stated, "Although Germans believe that a new world order should be established to prevent future wars, if wolves are allowed into the flock, that order cannot be established. Humanity yearns for solutions to the pressing social problems that exist in various countries, but these solutions cannot be achieved through cooperation with communists. Admiral DÃ¶nitz has entrusted me with the responsibility of foreign affairs. In this time of crisis for Germany, I step forward to serve the public. The flames of world war have not yet been extinguished. Germans continue to fight to defend their homeland. In the streets of the unoccupied areas, countless Germans, with nowhere to turn, are fleeing westward, escaping this indiscriminate terror under the pursuit of bombing fighters. The work of destruction continues behind the iron curtain in the East, unseen by the world. This iron curtain is constantly moving forward. In San Francisco, they are planning the organization of a new world order to provide security for the world. Everyone knows that the Third World War will not be a war to subjugate a particular nation, but a war that will lead to the end of humanity. The terrible weapons that were not used in this war will be unleashed to their fullest extent in the Third World War, sowing the seeds of destruction and death among humanity. Germans feel the full force of war and its destructiveness more than any other nation. German cities are destroyed, cultural monuments are reduced to rubble, and countless women and children are killed. Millions of young men die on the battlefield. Therefore, from the lips of mothers filled with sorrow, prayers will rise to Heaven to spare this world from the terror of a new war. This is what Germans wholeheartedly desire. We, the people of all Europe, threatened by famine and Bolshevik terror, hope to bring to this war-torn Europe a new world order of true and lasting peace, and a life of freedom and security. Eastern Germany, which was once the food supply for the starving people of Europe, has now fallen into the hands of the Bolsheviks. Europe will face famine, and Bolshevism will flourish in this land. The first step in the world revolution that the Soviet Union has desired for twenty-five years is the Bolshevization of Europe. From this, it can be inferred that either the Third World War or the successful achievement of the Soviet Union's world revolution is inevitable. Therefore, I view the San Francisco Conference as failing to achieve the goals that humanity desires. Germans believe that a world order should be established to prevent wars and reduce the factors that cause wars, but that order cannot be achieved by associating with wolves."

Recent Battle Situation in Various Parts of Germany

Stockholm, Sweden, 3rd Dispatch of the Central News Agency â According to the latest news obtained here, the battle for Berlin is nearing its end. In the past twenty-four hours, the Allied forces accelerated their advance on both the northern and southern flanks. In the northern region, the meeting of British and Soviet forces is imminent. Marshal Rokossovsky's troops are rapidly advancing westward from the lake district. General Montgomery's troops have also reached the Baltic region. The British army has not only announced the occupation of LÃ¼beck, but also claimed to have occupied Wismar in Mecklenburg, 35 kilometers north of Schwerin. If this British advance is indeed a fact, then the connection between Denmark and Schleswig-Holstein and Germany has been severed. In southern Germany, it is reported that U.S. forces have reached the Enns River and are maintaining radio contact with Soviet forces advancing westward from Vienna near Braunau am Inn, Hitler's birthplace. The two armies are within 65 li of each other. The U.S. Seventh Army is advancing from Munich and has reached a point 16 kilometers from Innsbruck, which is in Austria, 24 kilometers north of the Brenner Pass. In the Czech Republic, Soviet forces, with a large force, are advancing towards Bukhara, attempting to sweep the Moravian Ostrava line, and are advancing towards Alimitz, the center of the road leading to Bukhara, 37 kilometers from the flank of Soviet forces near BrÃ¼nn. At the same time, U.S. forces have entered the Czech Republic from two points, namely, northeast of Grafenau. In Berlin, Soviet troops have broken into Wilhelmstrasse, the center of the German capital's administrative district. The latest German announcement claims that the German defense forces have been divided into several groups and are still fighting.

### Colonial Issues and Japan's Position â Director of Information Matsudaira, Japanese Embassy in Shanghai

In recent months, the enemy has placed great emphasis on the colonial issue. According to their ideal, colonies should be completely opened up and allowed to become independent countries, so that each can find its place. This is the happiness of mankind and the path that mankind should follow. The current situation in Greater East Asia has already realized this ideal, but the enemy's intentions or claims are either to maintain the status quo or to attempt to seize colonies by force, leading to much debate and a chaotic situation.

Content of Colonial Issues Agreement

We have peered into the enemy's internal affairs. England currently possesses vast colonies and therefore hopes to maintain the status quo. The United States is also trying its best to seize islands in the Pacific. It is believed that at the Yalta Conference held in February of this year, England, the United States, and the Soviet Union reached some kind of agreement regarding the colonial issue. According to a Washington dispatch from the Associated Press on April 30, the main points of the agreement are: 1. Territories under mandate in the world; 2. Territories seized from the Axis powers in this war; 3. Territories that automatically apply for international administration. The above three types of territories will be subject to international administration and ruled by the world security organization. Judging by common sense, the above proposal was certainly not put forward by England, a major colonial power. Roosevelt expressed informal approval of this proposal, but upon returning to the United States, he faced opposition from the U.S. Army, Navy, and Congress, especially the Navy. From this, it can be seen that it was not put forward by Roosevelt either. In that case, it was undoubtedly put forward by Molotov. Furthermore, starting from this point, the mystery of why Molotov personally attended the San Francisco Conference immediately after receiving Truman's invitation is also solved.

England Strives to Maintain the Status Quo

Before Roosevelt died, King was the first to express strong opposition to the proposal to hand over the islands seized by the United States to international administration. Nimitz also opposed it. Truman, after succeeding as President, also expressed his opposition when he met with Secretary of War Stimson and Secretary of the Navy Forrestal. When Molotov arrived in Washington, it coincided with the U.S. Congress opposing the international administration proposal, which was like a demonstration against Molotov. At the same time, Molotov made a shocking proposal before the San Francisco Conference. England has not expressed its opinion on this issue, but British Deputy Prime Minister Attlee met with reporters on April 24 and stated that the purpose of international administration is to raise the living standards of the local residents, not to maintain strategic security, an intention in agreement with the U.S. Navy's claim. Because England already has vast colonies in the Pacific, it strives to maintain the colonial status quo, while the United States expresses opposition.

What are Chongqing's views? They often advocated supporting the international administration proposal and opposing British colonial policy at the Dumbarton Oaks Conference in September of last year. Their fundamental ideology is similar to Japan's Greater East Asia policy.

Development Process of the Colonial Movement

The modern colonial system gradually developed after the rise of European commercial capitalism and the advancement of navigation technology. European countries actively promoted the colonial movement using weapons and steam engines, causing various frictions. So-called colonial wars occurred everywhere, one after another. The first countries to go overseas to engage in colonization using ships were Spain and Portugal, followed by England and France. As a result, the British, with their piratical spirit, used their military force everywhere and displayed cunning diplomatic skills, always to their advantage. Regarding Spain, which held the initial advantage, Nelson sank the Spanish Armada in the Battle of Trafalgar. Next, regarding France, taking advantage of Napoleon's conquest of Europe and his lack of time to look back, England gained influence in Canada, India, and Africa, defeated the French army, and seized vast territories. By the time the Napoleonic Wars ended and the Congress of Vienna was convened, England's colonial territory had already been firmly established. (To be continued)

### Neighborhood Association Propaganda Committee Holds Establishment Ceremony; Director Gu Reports on Neighborhood Association Work Achievements

The Neighborhood Association Office of the Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau, in order to strengthen the Neighborhood Association organization and promote Neighborhood Association effectiveness, after consulting with the Municipal District Neighborhood Association Committee, hired individuals from the city's publicity and reporting fields as propaganda committee members, and separately hired staff members from various newspaper offices as propaganda officers for each district. The Neighborhood Association Propaganda Committee was established and held its establishment ceremony yesterday (3rd) at 6:30 PM at the Great Eastern Restaurant. The Neighborhood Association Office was responsible for the martial arts. Chen Binhe, Chairman of the Neighborhood Association Propaganda Committee, presided over the ceremony in person.

Attendees

Deputy Director of the Neighborhood Association Office Okawa, Koga Futao, Xu Banghao, Ding Zhuo, Xiao Gang, etc., representatives from various district Neighborhood Association offices Xue Hongkun and Chen Jiufeng, and Neighborhood Association committee members from various districts Wu Yunzhai, Xu Xiaochu, Chen Bingyin, Xie Baosheng, Wang Boyuan, Luo You, Zhu Qizhen, Wu Shihuai, Zhou Qiankang, Yang Mianbing, Chen Fukang, Yang Jiming, Wu Zhesheng, Yi Yi, Zhang Dongming, Lu Lu, Le Fenglin, Shen Siliang, Zhou Mengbai, Wang Binyan, Fan Yifeng, Xu Shengyang, Guo Liangchao, Yao Wenjun, Cheng Han, Zhao Gensheng, etc., and Neighborhood Association propaganda committee members Xu Liqiu, Hongyan, Lu Guangjie, Zhu Yongkang, Lu Feng, Hidaka Kiyomaro, Gu Shichang, Zhang Shankun, Chen Zhengzhang, and propaganda officers from various districts, totaling no fewer than two hundred people, gathered together.

Ceremony Proceedings

The meeting opened on time. First, Director Gu Jiwu delivered a speech, followed by a speech by Chen Binhe, Chairman of the Propaganda Committee. Then, Liu Yusheng, representing the staff members of various newspaper offices, gave a thank-you speech. Finally, a banquet was held for the propaganda officers of various district Neighborhood Associations, with enthusiastic spirits. The meeting adjourned at 9:30 PM.

Director Gu's Speech

In his speech, Director Gu stated: "Today, the Neighborhood Association Propaganda Committee is established, and I am very honored that you have all attended enthusiastically. I will now briefly report on the situation of the Neighborhood Association.

Shanghai's Neighborhood Association work can be said to be unique and closely related to the police. This kind of work must start from scratch, so progress is quite difficult. Each party often has areas that they do not understand. I rely on your guidance and assistance to ensure that the public can understand. I have several principles for handling Neighborhood Association affairs: First, to make Neighborhood Association work represent local interests, to organize the people, train the people, and bear the responsibility of protecting the people, and to do my best to reduce the concept of being used by the authorities. Second, the Neighborhood Association structure should not become bureaucratized, because Neighborhood Association personnel are uneven. If the Neighborhood Association becomes bureaucratized, it will definitely not be able to represent the interests of the people. As of today, various parties have gradually come to believe in and support the Neighborhood Association. I and the staff of this office are constantly reviewing the past, taking pride in it, and its strength has been formed due to the guidance of the press, which is why we have achieved this success.

Although the Neighborhood Association work has achieved some success, it has only achieved one or two out of ten. Future work requires continued efforts. I will briefly describe one or two of the past achievements:

First: The thorough registration of households. In the past, during the old concession era, the Municipal Council's purpose was to collect donations. The household surveys were fundamentally mixed. Whether bandits, thieves, or adulterers were hiding, they were not thoroughly investigated. In the past city area, a unit of "one room" was used, but it was difficult to apply to the city. Dozens of households often lived together, with at least six families or more. This office made great adjustments, taking "one house number" as a unit, establishing it as a main household, and dividing the rest into subordinate households. At the same time, secondary landlords were prevented from oppressing tenants.

Second, Neighborhood Association funds were very complicated in the past. Now, fees are collected uniformly, and a custodial committee is established in each district to be responsible for the safekeeping of the funds. All expenditures are considered carefully and used for the overall Neighborhood Association work, never wasting a penny. Currently, Neighborhood Association donations, except for those ordered by the authorities, have no extra collection.

In short, the Neighborhood Association's ability is gradually increasing. Neighborhood Association personnel should stand on a fair and honest footing, do things for the people, seek to avoid abuses, and achieve the goal of police and Neighborhood Association unity. I also hope that influential people in the local area will jointly participate in Neighborhood Association work, care for the Neighborhood Association, and continuously strengthen the Neighborhood Association."

Chairman Chen's Speech

Chen Binhe, Chairman of the Neighborhood Association Propaganda Committee, said in his speech: "I am very grateful for Director Gu's encouragement of the press for their efforts towards the Neighborhood Association. I am ashamed to say I am worthy. In fact, everyone here is a citizen, and citizens have a responsibility towards the Neighborhood Association. Moreover, we all serve in the press and should fulfill our reporting responsibilities towards the Neighborhood Association. The success of the Shanghai Neighborhood Association today is a miracle. In recent years, under the efforts of Director Gu and everyone, we have made great progress. As for us propaganda workers, we have several missions regarding the Neighborhood Association in the future: First, to do our best to explain all relevant Neighborhood Association laws and policies to the people, so that the people can understand. Second, to represent the people in expressing any opinions they may have on Neighborhood Association administration or even various municipal issues.

Shanghai's position is becoming increasingly important in the future, especially during this decisive stage. I proposed the point of police integration of Neighborhood Associations in the past, hoping that police and Neighborhood Associations would be united. Citizens must also assist the police to protect Shanghai. At the same time, I hope that the Neighborhood Association authorities will thoroughly investigate the household population once in the near future to ensure that traitors are completely eradicated.

Secondly, I also hope that the Neighborhood Association will pay close attention to Shanghai's livelihood issues. For example, the Municipal Advisory Committee recently launched a loan of 50 million yuan to farmers in Jiangsu. This action is imperative and is being carried out by a subcommittee organized by the Municipal Advisory Committee under the leadership of Secretary-General Luo. If such meaningful work is led by the Neighborhood Association, it will surely succeed.

Finally, I hope that the Neighborhood Association will make special efforts in the city's evacuation work. There is much work to be done in the future. We in the propaganda industry should fulfill our reporting tasks and give full play to the spirit of cooperation."

### Police Bureau Strictly Enforcing Light Control; Hoping Citizens Pay Close Attention to Prepare for Emergencies

Since the Hua Aircraft have repeatedly invaded Shanghai, the city's air defense authorities are making thorough preparations for various air defense measures to ensure safety and repeatedly instructing citizens to assist the authorities and strengthen air defense. In addition to setting up air raid shelters, air defense wells, and strengthening air defense work teams, special attention must be paid to light control. The Civil Air Defense Headquarters and the police authorities have repeatedly explained the meaning of air defense, instructing citizens to ensure that no light leaks out after nightfall, regardless of whether there is an air raid alarm. This is because Shanghai is facing the possibility of being invaded by aircraft at any time, so as to avoid the danger of being caught off guard. It is understood that the police authorities have ordered each branch bureau to strictly enforce light control. After nightfall, they will send personnel to patrol each jurisdiction. If there is light leaking out, whether from shops or residents, the power supply will be immediately shut off, and the current supply will be stopped. If oil lamps are still used and the light leaks, severe penalties will also be imposed. Therefore, it is hoped that citizens will pay close attention, cooperate, and strive to make air defense more perfect in order to prepare for emergencies.

### Municipal Government Bids Farewell to Chu Minyi

The newly appointed Governor of Guangdong Province, Chu Minyi, came to Shanghai from Beijing on official business a few days ago before taking office. The Municipal Government held a grand tea party at the International Hotel yesterday (3rd) at 4:00 PM to bid farewell. In addition to the Municipal Mayor's representative, Secretary-General Luo, and Security Commander's Office Chief of Staff Xiong Jiandong, Municipal Government Counselors, the Secretary Section Chief, and the heads of various bureaus and departments receiving guests, there were also central government officials stationed in Shanghai, Municipal Advisory Committee members, celebrities from all walks of life, and diplomatic officials stationed in Shanghai from Japan and Manchukuo, totaling over a hundred people. Chu arrived on time, and the atmosphere during the gathering was extremely cordial. The gathering lasted for one hour.

Cantonese Association Welcome Tea Party

The Guangdong Association in Shanghai also held a tea party yesterday (3rd) at 5:00 PM to welcome the new Governor, Chu Minyi. The attendees included Association Directors He Zhuoxian, Liang Haichou, Chen Qifen, Supervisors Chen Riping and Liu Ruxiang, and representatives from various county associations, totaling over a hundred people. Governor Chu arrived on time. After a brief rest, the tea party began. First, He Weixian delivered a welcome speech on behalf of the association, followed by a speech by Governor Chu, stating his ambitions for governing Guangdong Province. The gathering lasted for thirty minutes, ending in joy and harmony.

It is also learned that all directors and supervisors of the Guangdong Association hosted a banquet for Governor Chu at the Jinmen Hotel at 8:00 PM that evening (3rd).

### This City's Youth Celebrate Youth Day

The New Movement Branch and the Municipal Youth Corps of this city, in order to celebrate the May 5th Youth Day and to invigorate the fighting spirit of the city's youth, have decided to hold a joint celebration of the May 5th Youth Day at the Great Light Cinema on Jing'an Temple Road at 9:00 AM this morning. The implementation measures have been drafted and submitted to the Mayor for approval. The association has notified youth corps at all levels in the city to send members to participate in the grand event. It is also learned that after the meeting, the First District Corps of this city's youth troupe will perform the play "Soul of a Party Member" to add to the excitement.

### Registered Vehicles Must Comply with Scheduled Dates

The Municipal Bureau of Construction, for the registration of various vehicles, in order to facilitate the majority of citizens who did not follow the prescribed dates, extending the deadline to the approaching expiration, with late fees generally required, all rushed to the various vehicle registration offices, causing extreme crowding, and because the payment for lost licenses must be handled simultaneously with the Bureau of Finance, the procedures are rather tight, leading to complaints from the outside. According to the bureau's statement, personnel involved in vehicle registration have long been strictly prohibited from demanding bribes. At the same time, vehicle registration is being gradually improved to ensure convenience for citizens. However, because citizens do not pay attention to the scheduled dates, they crowd together once the deadline approaches, resulting in wasted time. Therefore, it is sincerely hoped that citizens will, in the future, comply with the prescribed dates for vehicle registration to avoid crowding.

### Tobacco Monopoly Bureau Reissues Smoker Licenses

Since the relocation of the Tobacco Monopoly Bureau to 13 Avenue Haig (i.e., the intersection of Route Ghisi and Avenue Haig), transportation has become more convenient. Starting from April 16th, the third phase of smoker licenses will be reissued, in accordance with the original license numbers and scheduled dates. Originally limited to May 5th, out of consideration for leniency, requests for supplementary issuance will still be allowed within ten days after the deadline.

### Zhan Zhou Shi Sentenced to Death

The main culprit in the murder of her husband, Zhan Zhou Shi, was publicly tried by the Shanghai District Court yesterday. The court, out of prudence, specially formed a collegial panel for the trial. Zhan Zhou confessed that she killed her husband with a kitchen knife due to abuse. She was sentenced to death for murder and deprived of her civil rights for life. If she does not agree with the judgment, she may file an appeal.

### Frequent Disputes over Excessive Water Usage

Recently, the tap water used by residents in various districts of the city has often exceeded the limit, resulting in excessively high fines. Landlords, whose monthly rental income is limited, often refuse to pay these unexpected losses, leading to frequent disputes. Some lanes are even threatened with water cutoffs, which is a very serious problem at present. It is also heard that the owner of Jing'an Building on Jing'an Temple Road has recently announced that all monthly water bills and penalty deposits, etc., will be borne by the tenants, which is essentially a disguised rent increase. The two parties are currently in negotiation.

### The Sanitation Bureau Actively Carries Out Garbage Removal Work and Strictly Prohibits Cleaners from Extorting Tips

Recently, garbage has been accumulating in the city's streets and alleys, especially at the garbage docks along the Huangpu River, where accumulation is even greater. The reason for this is that the contractors transporting garbage lack sufficient ships. The garbage from each street and alley is usually swept up and transported by sanitation workers of the Sanitation Bureau daily, and stored at designated garbage docks along the Huangpu River and Suzhou Creek, from where contractors transport it by ship to be disposed of outside the city. The bureau's management of the sanitation workers has always been strict, and theirå¾é has also been improved. Each person receives a monthly salary of at least 17,000 yuan, and is provided with threeæ of rice free of charge. Those who are not diligent are lightly punished, and severely dismissed. Therefore, all the workers dare not slack off in the slightest. However, many households in the city do not have garbage cans, leading to the long-standing habit of discarding garbage in the streets and alleys at any time. Often, as soon as the sanitation workers clear the garbage, it accumulates again shortly after. Therefore, the Sanitation Bureau has now sent a letter to the police and Baojia authorities to strictly ban this bad habit. As for garbage contractors, most of them complain that it is difficult to hire ships, leading to the increasing accumulation of garbage at the docks. The photograph printed in a certain newspaper the other day was of the garbage on this dock. The Sanitation Bureau is now urging contractors to add ships for transport, so as to clear it as soon as possible. As for sanitation work, it is contracted out to various cleaning companies, and the Sanitation Bureau only plays a supervisory role. Recently, many cleaners hired by these companies have been extorting tips, which is a violation of the contract. After receiving complaints from various circles, the Sanitation Bureau has been strictly fining the companies upon verification, hoping that the public will report any instances of cleaners extorting tips directly to the bureau, so that the companies can be ordered to eliminate the bad practice to eradicate the problem.

### Diphtheria Vaccination Begins

The Municipal Health Bureau considers that diphtheria has been prevalent in the city recently, especially among school-age children under the age of twelve, who are easily infected. Cases have been found in the city's municipal schools. After receiving the report, Director Yuan Rongchang ordered the department in charge to plan preventive vaccinations to eradicate the disease as soon as possible. Preparations have now been completed, and starting from April 30th, the bureau will send additional doctors and nurses to the city's municipal schools to administer diphtheria toxoid injections. According to the Director of the Health Bureau, this type of toxin injection provides a long period of immunity. It is hoped that students of each school will receive the injection as much as possible to avoid infection.

### Unqualified Pharmaceutical Businesses Ordered to Close

In recent years, many Western pharmacies have been established in the city, many of which do not comply with the regulations for the management of pharmaceutical businesses promulgated by the National Health Administration. The National Health Administration has always taken a strict review attitude towards this. Recently, the Administration received 119 Western pharmacies submitted by the Shanghai New Pharmaceutical Industry Association, applying for pharmaceutical business registration. After reviewing them separately, only seven, including Renhe Chemical Factory, were approved. 52 pharmacies, including Meilun Pharmacy, were either unclear about the events or did not meet the organizational requirements, and needed to be investigated separately for further consideration. The other 60, including Guochanghang Western Medicine Department, were found to be inconsistent with the current regulations for managing pharmaceutical businesses. The government has consulted the Municipal Government to instruct the Health Bureau to revoke their licenses and order them to close down. The Bureau will send personnel to carry out the orders at the addresses.

### Municipal Bureau of Economic Affairs Strictly Prohibits Unauthorized Price Increases and Secret Investigations by Large Numbers of Investigators

In order to stabilize people's livelihood, the Municipal Bureau of Economic Affairs attaches great importance to suppressing commodity prices. Therefore, it is stipulated that retail stores in the city should attach labels to the various commodities they sell, according to the approved new price limits, and clearly indicate the selling price. Recently, due to financial fluctuations, various businesses have been secretly changing the labeled prices of commodities, increasing them by 20% to 40%. This situation is a violation of government orders. If it is not strictly prohibited, it will have a significant impact on people's livelihood. It is heard that the Bureau has specially dispatched a large number of investigators to conduct secret investigations in different directions. If it is found that retail stores have raised the selling price of commodities without authorization, they will be severely punished and will not be tolerated.

### Convenient Transactions in Securities Market Will Not Be Restored

In order to stabilize finance and crack down on illegal transactions in the market, the financial authorities have ordered their departments to strictly check and monitor. Those who deliberately spread unsubstantiated rumors and disrupt the market will be investigated and dealt with according to law. It is now known that the Financial Affairs Inspection Office of the Central Reserve Bank is determined to strictly comply with government orders, dispatching personnel to inspect at any time, especially to crack down on the dramatic rise and fall of market prices. Recently, there have been proposals to restore convenient transactions in the securities market, but they have been rejected by the Supervisory Board. Regardless of whether the future financial situation stabilizes or not, convenient transactions will not be allowed in the market. Illegal black market transactions outside the market will be severely punished.

### Shanghai Radio Station Installs Loudspeakers for Broadcasting

In order to strengthen the city's air defense capabilities and promote citizens' knowledge of current affairs, the Shanghai Radio Station has specially installed loudspeakers in various parts of the city, so that citizens can hear all the station's air raid alarms and daily news reports and commentaries at any time. Recently, many loudspeakers have been installed in the Jing'an Temple Road and Nanjing Road area. It is understood that they will soon be installed in various major roads throughout the city, so as to be widespread. The program schedule for the radio station's loudspeaker broadcast is copied below: it will be officially broadcast on time starting from the 5th of this month.

### Municipal Propaganda Office Announces Box Office Registration Rules

Because there are many box offices in the city, but their internal organization and the meaning of the performances have not been reported in detail, and there are many conflicts with the theater rules, in order to unify the review and management, the "Shanghai Special City Box Office Registration Rules" were specially drafted and submitted to the Municipal Government for approval. It was announced and implemented from today and ordered the Finance Bureau and Police Bureau to comply. The registration rules are recorded below:

These rules are formulated in accordance with Article 1 of the revised "Shanghai Special City Theater Inspection Rules".

### Edible Oil Association Undergoes Reorganization

The Shanghai District Edible Oil Industry Association recently received an order from the Ministry of Industry to reorganize into the Shanghai Municipal Edible Oil Industry Association. The association's entire board of directors and supervisors resolved to begin preparing for the reorganization and established the Shanghai Municipal Edible Oil Industry Association Preparatory Committee, recommending Shen Weiya, Chen Ziyi, Ling Xingwu, He Quansheng, Zhang Dasu, Xie Yuxiang, Zhou Weibo, Yang Heqing, Chen Xianting, Chen Xiatang, Chen Yunxiang, Zhang Fengxiang, Wang Guojun, Chen Zhenzhan, Sun Wu, Huang Xingæ£®, He Yuç, Tang Wenxiong, Xu Zhixiang, Chen Yiåº·, He Zhenhan, and Shen Jiaxun as preparatory committee members to proceed with preparatory matters.

The Shanghai Children's Hospital and the True Heart Hospital are donating a large amount of Anjian'er milk powder to promote children's health. Families residing in the old Districts 18 and 2, and hidden impoverished families in Zhabei in the Nanshi area, who have (1) infants under three years of age who need milk powder supplements due to insufficient breast milk, (2) children under ten years of age who suffer from malnutrition due to illness, can apply from May 5th until the quota is filled. Except for Sundays, from 2 p.m. to 3 p.m. every day, parents should personally bring their resident certificate, their children, and a clean container or wrapping paper capable of holding two pounds of milk powder, and go to Shanghai Children's Hospital, 51 Xiangshan Road (Moliere Road), or Shanghai True Heart Hospital, 252 Tianjin Road (between Shilu and Shanxi Roads), for free registration. After passing the hospital's examination, the first batch of milk powder will be issued immediately, sufficient for two weeks of consumption. After the expiration date, subject to hospital re-examination and approval, distribution will continue until no longer needed or the milk powder is completely distributed. If indigestion occurs during the period of consumption, you can go to the powder distribution hospital for free diagnosis and treatment at any time. In addition, True Heart Hospital provides free medical care for internal medicine ailments other than lung disease and venereal disease, regardless of outpatient or inpatient treatment, medicine, and meals. No introduction is required.

### Ink Reward Donated to Charity School Fund

Mr. Zhang Yuelin wrote in a letter: "A few days ago, I wrote two rooftop contracts for people, a trivial labor that is not worth mentioning. However, I received a reward of 9,000 yuan, which I could not refuse, but I felt uneasy accepting it. Therefore, I will donate this amount to your newspaper's charity school fund to express my humble intention."

### Jingguang Free Clinic Opens

After five months of preparation, the Jingguang Free Clinic officially opened on the 1st of this month. The clinic is located in the Guon Temple, Puan Road (i.e. Velmont Road). The daily free consultation and medicine distribution time is from 1 p.m. to 4 p.m., benefiting the poor and sick.
