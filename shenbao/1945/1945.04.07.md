### General Suzuki Receives Imperial Mandate; Begins Organizing New Cabinet; Selections for Army and Navy Ministers Largely Determined

Tokyo, 6th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - General Kantaro Suzuki (pictured), tasked with forming a cabinet, is using his residence in Maruyama-cho, Koishikawa Ward, as his cabinet-building headquarters and began organizing the cabinet on the morning of the 6th. General Keisuke Okada also visited General Suzuki's cabinet-building headquarters at 8:00 AM on the 6th.

Tokyo, 6th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - General Kantaro Suzuki, who received the imperial mandate to form a cabinet, visited former Prime Minister Koiso, Reijiro Wakatsuki, Fumimaro Konoe, Kiichiro Hiranuma, and other senior statesmen around 3:00 PM on the 6th to report on receiving the imperial mandate. Afterwards, he returned to his cabinet-building headquarters and summoned Kazue Shida to discuss matters. It is reported that the selections for Army and Navy Ministers are largely determined. Suzuki plans to finalize the entire cabinet on the morning of the 7th, have an audience with the Emperor, and hold the investiture ceremony in the afternoon.

Tokyo, 6th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - After the Koiso cabinet resigned en masse, Baron Kantaro Suzuki, the incumbent President of the Privy Council and Admiral of the Navy, was ordered to organize a successor cabinet. On the morning of the 5th at 10:30 AM, Prime Minister Koiso convened an extraordinary cabinet meeting and respectfully presented the letters of resignation of the cabinet members to the Emperor. His Majesty the Emperor then summoned Kido Koichi, the Lord Keeper of the Privy Seal, to inquire about the leader of the succeeding cabinet. The Lord Keeper summoned senior statesmen to the Imperial Palace at 6:00 PM to carefully solicit their opinions. It was then decided that Privy Councillor Baron Kantaro Suzuki was the most suitable candidate for the leadership of the succeeding cabinet. After the senior statesmen's meeting concluded at 8:40 PM, they immediately went to the Palace to pay their respects to His Majesty the Emperor and present the proposed plan. Privy Councillor Suzuki then went to the Palace at 10:00 PM, had an audience with the Emperor, received the imperial mandate to form a cabinet, and requested time for consideration before leaving the Emperor's presence.

Brief Biography of General Suzuki

Tokyo, 6th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - Admiral Kantaro Suzuki, who was ordered to form a cabinet, was born in Sekiyado, Chiba Prefecture, in the third year of the Keio era. He is 79 years old this year and is the elder brother of Lieutenant General Takao Suzuki, the chief priest of Yasukuni Shrine. In Japan, it is extremely rare for two brothers to both be generals. He graduated from the Naval Academy in the 21st year of the Meiji era and was commissioned as a Navy Ensign the following year. In the fourth year of the Showa era, he was personally appointed as Chamberlain by the Chief of the Naval General Staff and served until his retirement. During these 44 years, he served in the Navy Department, holding positions as Director of both the Personnel and Military Affairs Bureaus of the Navy Ministry, Vice Minister of the Navy, Commander-in-Chief of the Second and Third Fleets, Commander-in-Chief of the Kure Naval District, Commander-in-Chief of the Combined Fleet, and Military Councilor. In the 14th year of the Taisho era, he assumed the important position of Chief of the Naval General Staff. He retired in January of the 4th year of Showa and succeeded Count Sutemi Chinda as Chamberlain and concurrently Privy Councilor. The Emperor held him in high esteem. He was wounded during the February 26th Incident in the 11th year of Showa. In November of that year, he resigned from the position of Chamberlain and was granted the title of Baron. In June of the 15th year of Showa, after Vice President Yoshimichi Hara was promoted to President, he succeeded him as Vice President. In August of the 19th year of Showa, President Hara passed away, and he was promoted to President of the Privy Council, a position he holds to this day, having served in the Privy Council for 16 years. While serving in the Navy Ministry, he was considered an authority on Japanese naval tactics. As Vice Minister of the Navy, he assisted Navy Minister Yatsushiro, preventing the Navy Minister, who was not well-versed in military administration, from deviating from the norm, and demonstrated extraordinary skill in personnel administration within the ministry. He was regarded as a candidate for Navy Minister, but General Suzuki often said, "I am not a tool for military administration; I am a naval officer. I hope to go to sea," and consistently maintained the original character of a military man, eventually becoming Commander-in-Chief of the Combined Fleet, the highest honor, and finally Chief of the Naval General Staff. It is a miracle that the serious injuries General Suzuki sustained in the February 26th Incident were healed. To this day, a bullet remains in his body, and at the age of 79, his spirit is still like that of a young man, maintaining his straightforward military style.

### Lieutenant General Kuribayashi Promoted to General

Tokyo, 6th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - Lieutenant General Tadamichi Kuribayashi of the Japanese Army, since assuming the position of supreme commander of the Iwo Jima area, has staunchly defended the key point in the south, repeatedly inflicting heavy damage on the enemy forces. In the past month, he has fought bravely and desperately defended Iwo Jima to the best of his ability, achieving the great victory of annihilating 33,000 enemy soldiers. His efforts have reached the ears of the Emperor, and by imperial order, he has been posthumously promoted to the rank of General.

### Soviet Union Notifies Japan of Termination of Neutrality Pact

Moscow, 6th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - Soviet Foreign Minister Vyacheslav Molotov met with Japanese Ambassador Sato on the afternoon of the 5th and stated that the Neutrality Pact concluded between Japan and the Soviet Union on April 13, 1941, has lost its meaning due to the fundamental changes in the situation that have occurred since then. Therefore, based on Article 3 of the treaty, the Soviet government is notifying the Japanese government of its intention to terminate the treaty. Ambassador Sato promised to convey the above notification to his home government before leaving.

Tokyo, 6th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - The Japanese government and public did not find the Soviet Union's notification of the termination of the Japan-Soviet Neutrality Pact surprising. It could be discerned from Chairman Stalin's speech at the Soviet Revolution anniversary last November and the trend of the world war situation. The termination of the Japan-Soviet Neutrality Pact is inevitable and is also what the Japanese authorities expected. The Japan-Soviet Neutrality Pact was established in April 1941 and stipulated a validity period of five years. If neither of the treaty parties expressed an intention to terminate the treaty one year before the expiration date, it could be extended for another five years.

Japanese Foreign Ministry Issues Statement

Tokyo, 6th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - After receiving an official telegram regarding the Soviet Union's notification of the termination of the Japan-Soviet Treaty on the 6th, the Japanese Foreign Ministry issued the following statement at 2:00 PM: Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov notified Japanese Ambassador Sato on April 5th that the Japan-Soviet Neutrality Treaty was signed on April 13, 1941, before the outbreak of the German-Soviet War and the Japanese war against Britain and the United States. However, fundamental changes have occurred in the world situation since then. Japan has aided Germany in its war against the Soviet Union and is at war with the Allied powers of Britain and the United States, which are allied with the Soviet Union. Under these circumstances, the Japan-Soviet Neutrality Treaty has lost its meaning. Therefore, based on Article 3 of the treaty, the Soviet government declares that the term of the Japan-Soviet Neutrality Treaty will not be extended after its expiration next April.

Lisbon, 6th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - German News Agency report, Washington: Well-informed sources in the US Senate say that the Soviet Union's announcement of the cancellation of the Soviet-Japanese Neutrality Treaty is one of the secret agreements of the Yalta Conference. Furthermore, according to the US State Department's recent evaluation of the current situation: "The US government naturally welcomes the Soviet government's cancellation of the Soviet-Japanese Neutrality Treaty."

### MacArthur Appointed Commander-in-Chief of Army in Pacific Operations

Japanese Army on Cebu Island Reports War Results

Philippines, 6th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - The morale of the Japanese garrison troops on Cebu Island is extremely high.

### Battle on Okinawa Island Intensifying

Tokyo, 6th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - After crossing Okinawa Island, the American enemy is rushing south, continuing their southward advance on three fronts with units from the east coast, the central area, and the west coast. On the east coast, the enemy advanced to Kuba on the afternoon of the 3rd, rapidly increasing reinforcements. By the afternoon of the 5th, approximately 5,000 enemy infantry with 200 tanks had invaded the area of Wauge (6 kilometers southwest of Kuba). At noon on the 5th, over 30 enemy vessels, centered around battleships and cruisers, invaded Nakagusuku Bay and began mine-sweeping operations. At the same time, they subjected the Japanese army's positions to intense naval bombardment, covering the enemy ground forces moving south. In the central area, a considerable number of enemy troops, utilizing several tanks, attacked our position at Guku on the morning of the 5th. The Japanese army immediately launched a brave counterattack, stopping the enemy's advance. In the west coast area, the enemy attempted to break through the 385-meter-high hill southeast of Oyama, but were repelled by the Japanese army. The enemy is currently urgently attempting to reinforce their forces and is continuing to transport personnel and supplies ashore with over 300 landing craft in front of Chatan.

Editorial

### The Necessary Conditions for Social Leaders

"Politics" is the management of public affairs. Therefore, all matters concerning the welfare of the people must be led and managed by the government. When there is a good government and wise officials, the people should, on the one hand, support it and, on the other hand, supervise it. However, the government cannot, in fact, handle all social affairs single-handedly. Instead, they should be jointly managed by members of society. Therefore, social leaders should take on the task of assisting in completing these tasks. Only when the government's work and the work of society are coordinated can the mission of providing welfare to the people be accomplished. If there is only a good government and wise officials but no good society or wise social leaders, it cannot be coordinated. Similarly, if there is only a good society but no good government, the two cannot complement each other. Therefore, both are indispensable.

Secondly, the formation and transformation of social customs and mores, and the actions of social leaders are enough to have an impact. Therefore, the transformation of social customs depends entirely on whether the leadership of social leaders is appropriate. We believe that a person who is a social leader should have several necessary conditions: old age and experience, integrity and impartiality, and willingness to work hard and endure hardship.

First, among the current social leaders in Shanghai, there are not many who can be called old and experienced, but it cannot be said that there are none. For example, several senior predecessors are models of old age and experience.

Second, it is not easy to achieve integrity and impartiality. However, it is not enough to have only integrity and impartiality; one must also have enthusiasm. The so-called enthusiasm should include: not being afraid of offending people, identifying right and wrong, and creating the power of public opinion in society; and attacking bad people so that they dare not raise their heads.

Third, as long as it is for the benefit of the public, they must do their best, and even if there are criticisms, they must endure everything with the spirit of working hard and enduring hardship. At the same time, there are often those who are selfish and self-serving, secretly setting up obstacles, and this deeply ingrained habit should be broken with the courage to break it, and the spirit to fight against evil forces.

Fourth, it is not enough to have old predecessors leading; middle-level members should be cultivated at any time in preparation for replacement and inheritance, and old predecessors must encourage and protect them in their positions as predecessors.

Only with social leaders who possess the above-mentioned conditions can this society be healthy and gradually transform its customs and mores.

In the case of this city, in the past, the Municipal Advisory Committee, the Citizens' Welfare Association, etc., led the organization of several public affairs, such as donations to the military and police, winter relief, low-priced rice, and relief bonds, etc. These few things were all for the benefit of the citizens and were all assisting the government in seeking the welfare of the citizens. Therefore, from a normal perspective, none of them are letting the citizens down. Only those who are selfish and self-serving, those who only know themselves and not others, and those who only know rights and not obligations, think it is meddling. However, there are many social public undertakings that Shanghai needs to carry out, and now it is only the beginning. Those who shoulder the leadership responsibility for these social undertakings, the old predecessors cannot retreat, and the middle-level members are really not enough, and should be cultivated at any time, and good ones should be sought out and promoted at any time.

However, on the one hand, it is inevitable that there are selfish people who only know their rights, crowding into the ranks of social leaders, saying one thing and meaning another, pretending to mediate. If these people do not change their selfish mentality immediately, we believe that in order to prevent social undertakings from being obstructed, they should be eliminated, so as not to hang a sheep's head and sell dog meat, and harm the herd. Because these people are mixed in, they secretly conspire to sabotage every work related to public welfare, or at least take a passive attitude. May I ask, what qualifications do these people have to stand in the ranks of social leaders, who have the name of directors of charitable organizations, but do not contribute money or effort to charity and public welfare? Unless they recognize their mistakes and change them, or they know better and retreat and escape, otherwise, it is deeply believed that public opinion will not be lenient, and they will be despised by society one day. We are willing to give a warning first.

### A Glimpse of Zhenze, Wujiang

— Jianping

Taking the Beijing-Shanghai line on the express train west, it is already the next morning when you arrive in Suzhou. After resting for a while in a hotel outside the city, hire a small car to leave Suzhou. In the past, the Sujia Railway could be used to reach Pingwang, but since it was dismantled the year before last, the only public-operated transportation is one China Central long-distance bus per day. The rest are commercially operated trucks, small cars, and one or two small transport ships. The small car I hired broke down halfway due to burning charcoal and its old machinery. It was not until late at night that I arrived in Zhenze.

Zhenze is located south of Taihu Lake, north of Wuzhen, west of Pingwang, and east of Nanxun. It is only twelve li from Nanxun, but in that short distance, the different boundaries of Jiangsu and Zhejiang have already been demarcated. The waterway has a canal, and the road connects Suzhou to the east and Huzhou to the west, so transportation is quite convenient and under the jurisdiction of Wujiang County. The town has a district head, currently Wang Chengji, who is in charge of taxation and local political work, and the town head is Gong Tong, who also serves as the head of the Farmers' Education Center.

Products

The entire town is divided into East, South, West, and North sections. The streets are narrow, and the shops are lined up. In recent years, due to the decline of the surrounding towns, it has formed a distorted prosperity. The main products are silk, wool, rice, vegetables, firewood, etc. The nationally famous "Qili Silk" is produced in the Nanxun and Zhenze area. Due to the economic downturn in Nanxun in recent years, Zhenze has become a major base for the silk trade. During the summer and autumn seasons, the silk trade is so congested that the roads are impassable. These two seasons are also the most prosperous time of the year. In recent years, due to the obstruction of foreign transportation and the cessation of exports, as well as heavy taxes, the silk industry is not as good as before.

In the past, Zhenze had a large-scale silk factory, but it was closed long ago due to the war. Therefore, apart from a few rural farmers weaving silk by hand with wooden looms (which is not as good as Shengze silk), there is almost no manufacturing in this area.

Regarding wool, it is currently the prosperous season for spring wool, and prices fluctuate greatly. Because it is sheep's wool, the quality is better than the goat wool in North China. Many Japanese merchants are engaged in this industry, and most of the wool weaving factories in Shanghai now use their products.

People's Livelihood

The current rice price is around 20,000, but the rice shops do not have rice, similar to the situation in Shanghai, where villagers secretly peddle it. Vegetables include the large green vegetables from nearby Taihu Lake, which are fresh and tender and have always been transported to Shanghai for sale. Firewood is divided into rice straw and mulberry branches, and each load costs more than a thousand yuan. Rents range from several hundred yuan to several thousand yuan, but it is full everywhere. Chicken eggs cost sixty or seventy yuan each. Pork is more expensive than in Shanghai. Vegetable oil costs 1,400 yuan per jin, and due to the freezing of cabbage in the winter, the production of vegetable oil this year is likely to be insufficient. The oil extraction industry in this town is not very developed. Only one oil mill in the East section uses both manual and electric power. Except for fish and shrimp, which are especially cheap, other daily necessities are more expensive than in Shanghai. Usually, a small family of three or four people needs tens of thousands of yuan in expenses.

Education

Education is extremely declining. There are three elementary schools: Xieqiaohe Elementary School, Meishichang Elementary School, and Chitangqiao Elementary School, all of which are county-run. There are only two middle schools: Jicheng Middle School (private) and Silk Industry Middle School (county-run). Zhenze used to have the famous Zhenshu Middle School and Yuying Middle School. The latter was run by diplomat Shi Zhaoji, and the building was magnificent, but now it is a ruined wall and a tragic scene. Although there is no well-equipped hospital in the local area, there are many talented people in Chinese and Western medicine.

Local Security: There are police stations, security teams, Jixiang teams, and detective teams, so the town is quite safe. In the countryside, there are roaming bandits, and kidnappings are sometimes heard.

Gambling is rampant in Zhenze. Even children gamble, and the winnings and losses amount to tens of thousands. Hundreds of thousands or even millions are not uncommon. Some use stones of rice and ornaments as winnings and losses. Because the rich area lacks entertainment, they learn to use gambling as a play. It is said that a certain captain at a banquet mortgaged so many ornaments overnight that there were two drawers full. Whether this story is true or false, it is enough to describe the rampant gambling in Zhenze, which is probably even worse than Shanghai, which is known for its luxury.

Finance

In terms of finance, there is only one Dachang Bank, which usually transfers money in Suzhou. All business firms take a steady attitude, so they do not feel that there is a shortage of regulation.

During my several days in Zhenze, I felt that although it is a small town that few people have heard of, its rich production, commercial prosperity, and the people's peaceful life are rare in Jiangsu Province today. At this time of dispersing the population, Zhenze's industry and commerce are waiting to be developed by Shanghai people who have been dispersed.

### Germany's Determination to Resist Remains Unshaken

— Goebbels Publishes Article —

Berlin, 6th (Central News Agency dispatch) - German News Agency reports: German Propaganda Minister Goebbels wrote in the national magazine: "The enemies have divergent opinions on world issues, and the only thing they can unanimously agree on is to destroy Germany and eliminate the German people. However, they use very different means to achieve this goal, and each wants to seize the largest amount of loot from the hands of others. If this madness of the enemy were to be realized, the whole world would fall into a terrible tragedy, not just our country. The current stage of the war cannot be judged solely from the military situation, because although the military situation has an important impact on the final decision, other national, political, social, and economic situations are also gradually becoming apparent and will be as important as the military situation. We should pay attention to these situations. Perseverance is still the highest principle for Germans to fight. After we remove the burden of this war, we will immediately devote ourselves to the task of peace, but while we still have to bear the burden of war, we only have one slogan, that is, to resist the enemy's attack with unshakable perseverance, to fight at any cost, to move forward bravely, and neither good fortune nor misfortune can make us change in any way."

### U.S. Central Army on Western Front Penetrates Thuringia; Northern Army Crosses the Weser River

Berlin, 6th (Central News Agency dispatch) - The northern and central wings of the anti-Axis forces on the Western Front have penetrated deep into German territory and are engaged in street fighting in Osnabruck and Karlsruhe.

Berlin, 6th (Central News Agency dispatch) - Havas Agency reports: The anti-Axis forces are increasing pressure on four lines, with the focus of the attack in the area between the Ems and Weser rivers and in Thuringia. After crossing the Ems-Weser Canal, part of the anti-Axis forces advanced along the Ems, while another part attacked towards the Weser. The left wing of the U.S. Third Army is fighting in the Werra River area, and its right-wing tank column has reached Arnstadt, apparently seeking to link up with the central force advancing east from Erfurt. However, it is still uncertain whether General Patton intends to advance towards the Halle-Leipzig area or turn north to sweep away the German defenses on the Weser River. The advance of the U.S. tank column along the Wurzburg-Ansbach highway has not been completely stopped. The intention of General Patton's forces to advance south from Heilbronn to Stuttgart is becoming increasingly clear.

### Chinese and Manchukuo Youth Representatives Held Symposium Yesterday; Manchukuo Consul General Hosts Banquet for Representatives

Li Shudong (Deputy Chief of the Shuangcheng County Headquarters of the Manchukuo Concordia Association), Cao Jiyuan (Director of the Training and Guidance Department of the National Labor Service Corps Headquarters), Liu Zhongxiu (Official in the General Affairs Office of the National Labor Service Corps), Zhang Wen (Leader of the Youth Class of the Haicheng County Headquarters of the Concordia Association), and Wang Guichun (Official of the Manchukuo Ministry of Foreign Affairs), a group of five representatives from the Youth League and National Labor Service Corps of the Manchukuo Concordia Association, came to China recently to study the situation of youth leagues in our country. The Manchukuo delegation arrived in Shanghai from Beijing a few days ago. Yesterday (6th) afternoon at 4 o'clock, under the auspices of the Manchukuo Consul General, they hosted Shanghai youth representatives and local news reporters at the Bimao Hotel for a symposium to exchange ideas.

Chinese and Manchukuo Representatives Gather Together

The Manchukuo delegation arrived on time under the leadership of Consul General Ye De and Wang Wenjingyi, an official from the consulate. On the Chinese youth side, Gu Senchen, Secretary-General of the Shanghai New Movement Branch, along with secretaries and organization section chief Shen Taiyi, training section chief Wu Tiaofei, Li Liguo of the China Youth Model 4th Regiment, Ding Sheng and Wang Gang of the Youth League Municipal Headquarters 1st District, and over fifty reporters from various newspapers in the city attended. During the meeting, Consul General Ye De first introduced the representatives visiting Shanghai and described the rapid progress of Manchukuo's construction since its founding thirteen years ago. Then, representative Han Shudong reported on the Manchukuo youth movement and its current tasks. Next, representative Cao Jiyuan reported on the National Labor Service Corps system. Afterwards, Shen Jifeng, organization section chief of the Shanghai New Movement Branch, and Wu Duanfeng, training section chief, successively presented the organization and training process of the Chinese New Youth League. Then, Li Liguo of the China Youth Model 4th Regiment and Shao Yugang of the China Youth 1st District successively presented detailed information on the organization of the model team and the general situation of the Youth League in Tai City. During the meeting, Chinese and Manchukuo representatives had in-depth discussions on the situation of youth in their respective countries, and the atmosphere was extremely warm. At 6 p.m., Consul General Ye De hosted a banquet to welcome the representatives of the Chinese and Manchukuo youth leagues and local news reporters. There was lively conversation and toasts, and the guests and hosts parted happily at 8 p.m.

Consul General Ye De Delivered a Speech of Introduction

Consul General Ye De first delivered an introductory speech, stating in brief: "Today, I introduce the youth league and labor service corps representatives dispatched by the Concordia Association of our country to meet with you. I sincerely hope that you will conduct a thorough study and review of the youth and labor service systems of our country. I am particularly pleased that you have taken the time from your busy schedules to attend. Although the founding period of Manchukuo is short, in these thirteen years, all domestic construction has achieved an era-transcending speed. At a time when the world is at war, on the one hand, we are working hard to increase national production, and on the other hand, we are contributing to the world, especially to East Asia. Manchukuo has realized the strengthening of national power under difficult and arduous circumstances and doubled labor. Therefore, Manchukuo is vigorously carrying out the youth movement. It is believed that the spirit of our country's founding, under the auspices of the Concordia Association, enables every youth to obtain effective results. Looking back since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, our country has made the greatest efforts in increasing industry in the rear. In order to strengthen production, it is necessary to gather the strength of the whole country and national mobilization. In order to further enhance it, there is a labor service system that is widely implemented in the country. It is believed that the implementation of labor service increases production and has been very effective since it began two years ago. At this time when the Greater East Asia War is fierce, we must unite and work together to strengthen production and complete the revival of East Asia as soon as possible, and prevent the Anglo-American enemy from invading. Today, we gather together with enthusiasm, and I sincerely hope that we will have a sincere discussion."

### Air Defense Headquarters Hopes Citizens Will Pay Attention to Air Defense Facilities; Five Points Require Close Attention

Although the city's air defense work has achieved good results through the guidance, training, and exercises of the Air Defense Headquarters, it has not yet reached the ideal state.

### Recent Developments in Pork Sales and Transportation in the City

— Jiaxi

"Better to eat without meat than to live without bamboo," these were the words of ancient literati. Due to nutritional concerns, modern people have long since adopted "Better to live without bamboo than to eat without meat." As a metropolis with five million people, the consumption of pork is naturally very large. In order to understand the situation, I specifically visited Huang Qidong, chairman of the Pork Retailers' Guild, who kindly provided detailed information on the industry as follows:

Sources of Pigs

The main sources of pork consumed in Shanghai are as follows: one is the Jiangbei area, such as Taizhou, Taiyu, Dongtai, Rubao, Mengcheng, as well as Huaian, Huaiyin, Suqian, and Siyang. The second is the Jinpu Railway line, such as Mingguang, Huaizhou, Xuzhou, Dangtu, and Wuhu. Before the war, the number of pigs transported to Shanghai from these two lines each month was more than 100,000. After the war, due to reduced production, transportation difficulties, and purchasing power, the total number of pigs transported to Shanghai each month is only more than 30,000. Among them, 70% are shipped from Jiangbei and 30% from the Jinpu Railway line. In addition, about 1,000 to 2,000 heads are transported from the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou lines, such as Suzhou, Jiaxing, and Hangzhou, each month, which people in the industry call "traveling pigs." However, the above-mentioned areas on the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou lines sometimes come to Shanghai to purchase. As for the so-called "country pigs," they refer to those raised in the suburbs of Shanghai. The number is very small, and it has little impact on market prices.

Market Price Formation

The prices of pigs in various places of origin are still very low. For example, a Jiangbei pig (average 70 kilograms) is worth about 40,000 to 60,000 yuan per head. The Jinpu Railway line is even cheaper due to transportation difficulties, with each head ranging from 10,000 to 30,000 yuan.

The selling price at the Shanghai Livestock Market and Fresh Pork Sales Office once soared to 105,000 yuan per dan. It is said that the black market is even more expensive. In theory, the resellers should have made a considerable profit, but this is not the case. Although the purchase price is low, the expenses along the way are very large. In addition, there are unexpected losses such as sick pigs, dead pigs, and robberies. Therefore, the profit or loss of selling pigs to Shanghai is also uncertain.

There are more than 40 types of fees added along the way from the origin of the pigs to Shanghai, ranging from dozens to thousands of yuan each time, including remittance fees, totaling more than 30,000 yuan per pig. After the pigs arrive in Shanghai, they must pass through the market and the hands of brokers, and then be sold wholesale to various retailers, and the price will increase by another 10-20%. Therefore, the retail price of pork is becoming more and more expensive.

Regarding Price Limits

Since the authorities restricted pork prices, many meat shops have been punished, but the black market has not been eliminated. Regarding this issue, Huang expressed his determination to assist the government in suppressing prices as the chairman of the guild, and also hoped that the authorities would understand the difficulties of the industry. Because the authorities' price limit this time only applies to retailers, and there is no limit on sellers and wholesalers, sellers and wholesalers still sell at high prices, and the wholesale price once increased to 1,200 to 1,300 yuan per catty. Compared with the retailers' income and expenses, the difference is very large. Therefore, those with strong capital stop and wait and see; shops with weak capital, squatters, and non-members, because they cannot sustain their expenses, risk operating on the black market and are often punished, which is truly sympathetic.

It is essential to set a fair pork price; but if the price of live pigs arriving at the port can be regulated first, and then the wholesale price and retail price can be set, the execution can be reduced a lot. The pork on the market today is the live pig of yesterday, and the price fluctuates completely according to the supply and demand. To prevent the pork from exceeding the limit, it is necessary to start by restricting the price of live pigs.

Huang once suggested to the economic authorities to establish a review committee, and drafted detailed measures, which were approved, but have not been realized due to divergent opinions from all parties.

### Today is Horse Loving Day; Celebration Ceremony Held

The Shanghai Sports Association has designated today (7th) as Horse Loving Day and will hold a celebration ceremony at its racecourse at 1 p.m. There will also be special race programs. The association invited the heads of various agencies in the city yesterday to attend the grand ceremony. It will surely be a grand occasion at that time. In the Meiji era of Japan, in order to promote horse administration, April 7th was specifically designated as "Horse Loving Day." Every year on this day, memorial services for fallen military horses and equestrian competitions between the military and civilians must be held in various places in order to cultivate a national atmosphere of horse loving.

### Changning Police Bureau Strictly Prohibits the Sale of Black Market Tickets; Criminals Arrested and Sent to the District Prosecutor's Office for Punishment

The Changning Road Police Sub-bureau of this city has paid close attention to "black market tickets" and black hats harassing passengers at the West Railway Station and has successively captured more than ten cases of illegal black hats. However, recently, a group of small vendors and women have mixed into the crowd, purchased tickets, and resold them at high prices for profit. When the bureau learned about this, it believed that the evacuation work was in progress and this kind of hindrance could not be allowed. Therefore, it secretly ordered an investigation and cracked down on several cases of Yang Xia, Weng Yingsheng, etc. After interrogation, they confessed to selling black market tickets for profit and were transferred to the District Prosecutor's Office for strict handling.

### International Postal Remittances Limited

The Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau of this city recently approved a notice from relevant standing bureaus regarding international postal remittances (from various parts of Central China to various parts of Japan). Effective immediately, a quota will be implemented, stipulating that each person may remit no more than 300 Japanese yen per month, and the remitter's rationing certificate must be respected before the remittance can be made, in order to prevent the occurrence of remittances in false names. It is also learned that the bureau will re-investigate the exchange rate for domestic remittances from today.

The agency has reported this to the police for investigation. If anyone finds that the agency's employees are extorting tips, it is hoped that reports will be made so that a thorough investigation and severe punishment can be carried out to reassure passengers. The agency's service scope is limited to docks Nos. 1 to 14 in the old District 1 and the Wansheng Wheel, which is docked at the northern part of the former Taikoo Dock, while the luggage handling for the Xinning-Shaoshao transport, which is docked at the southern part, is not served by the agency.

### The Youth Movement in Manchukuo

—Report by the Manchukuo Representative at Yesterday's懇談会 Meeting—

Manchukuo Youth Training Goals: Manchukuo representative Han Shutong yesterday delivered a report on the youth movement at the恳谈会 meeting, stating: "Regarding the youth movement in Manchukuo, the entire nation has paid considerable attention since the establishment of the country. In order to build the nation of the future, we must value the second generation of youth, therefore, special efforts have been made in youth activities since the founding of the country. In the twenty-sixth year of the Republic of China, which is the fourth year of Kangde, the government and the people jointly formulated the rules for youth training and began to implement them. Later, it was presided over by the unified organization of the Central Cooperative Society, and since then, youth activities have flourished. In the twenty-ninth year of the Republic of China, the labor force of the youth league was enormous, such as the construction of the Jinghe Line (Xinjing to Harbin), the Hada Road (Harbin to Dalian) and other road constructions, all of which were undertaken by the youth. Therefore, the other party attached great importance to the development of youth, and the National Labor Service Corps was established.

In terms of training, youth training can be carried out on a county-level basis, divided into training youth league members, re-training of members, cadre training, and even total discontinuity. As for the organization of the league, those from eleven to sixteen years old are the Young Pioneers, and those from sixteen to twenty-three years old are the Youth League, for both men and women. There is also the organization of the Youth Action Team, composed of outstanding members, whose task is to assist in maintaining public order, communicating intelligence, firefighting, air defense, etc. In addition, there are youth mechanical teams, chemical teams, marine teams, etc.

Overview of activities, production increase activities include reclaiming wasteland.

The Manchukuo youth movement was reported by the Manchukuo representative at yesterday's恳谈会 meeting. Afforestation, seed disinfection, soil manure transformation, etc., are all the work of the Junior League. There are also transportation of grain, anti-smoking campaigns and prevention activities, emergency rescue air defense, etc. There are also many cultural activities, as well as physical examinations, and the initiation of mountain climbing, etc. Therefore, the future training policy and educational goals are, first, to strengthen combat power, increase production, and develop industry. The second is to promote the national concept. In the future, every Manchurian citizen should cultivate the concept of the nation as the greater self of East Asia."

National Labor Service System: Yuan, the Director of the Manchukuo National Labor Service Corps Training Office, released the Labor Service System, stating: "Regarding the Manchukuo National Labor Service Corps, it is based on the youth as the main body, that is, starting from the youth. Its organization is from twenty-one to twenty-three years old, regardless of the people of the country, within this age range, those who have not yet become citizens, must participate in the Labor Service System. Therefore, labor service in Manchukuo is a national administration, promulgating the Labor Service Law, its system is implemented according to the needs of the current situation, to increase important industries for the group family, each person must do their best to implement it, which is also the duty that the citizens should fulfill. Although it is stipulated that several civil servants and those who serve important production can be exempted, it is necessary to observe that their service in this industry must be at least ten years above the appropriate age, before they can be allowed, otherwise, if they drop out halfway, they must still perform labor service, in order to prevent loopholes. Therefore, this system is implemented with the spirit of legislation, to make it the duty that citizens should advance. The service time is stipulated as eight hours of work per day, and all aspects of life, people are all willing to participate. Its organization is divided into platoons, squads, companies, and even large groups,展开ing in every township, cultivating from the township concept to the national concept.

As for the training of cadres, strict training is given every year, with the emphasis on regulating action discipline, with the aim of enabling them to exert guidance to the masses. At the same time, the consolidation of the cadres' thinking is emphasized, otherwise they must be re-trained, two or three times. Therefore, the current burden of Manchukuo on the Labor Service Corps is huge.

Regarding the organization of the Labor Service Corps, first, security must be consolidated, second, politics must be clean, third, household registration must be cleared, fourth, youth cadre training must have strict steps in advance, so the loyal and dutiful citizens of Manchukuo believe that this is the first success."
