### Japanese Forces in Burma Complete Mission, Cross River to Join Main Force

Tokyo, 14th (Central News Agency Telegram) – A strong Japanese force merged with the main Japanese force east of the Chindwin River on the 14th. From April to the present, this unit has repeatedly operated behind enemy lines, braving the mud of Burma's unique rainy season, and continuously fought to contain the enemy's large force, making a significant contribution to preventing the enemy from preparing for the next operation. Having fully accomplished this mission, they undertook a new mission from July 20th, jointly launching an attack on Mandalay, which was filled with enemy troops, and broke through it. Yesterday, the main Japanese force crossed the Chindwin River to the east bank with all its might, achieving great success in the large-scale withdrawal operation.

### Reactions to Soviet Entry into the War

Zurich, 14th (Central News Agency Telegram) – Britain and the United States believed that the Soviet Union's participation in the war against Japan would not occur for at least several weeks. Therefore, they found the Soviet Union's sudden declaration of war against Japan to be quite strange, and there are various speculations. It is said that during the Potsdam Conference, Truman requested the Soviet Union's participation in the war. This can be clearly understood from Truman's announcement on the 9th. However, Stalin only generally agreed in principle and avoided making any statements regarding the timing of participation. According to a British Daily News report, the Soviet Union only notified Britain and the United States one or two hours before issuing the declaration of war. Therefore, the Soviet Union's participation seems to have been a sudden decision. Regarding the reasons for this, Britain and the United States both believe that it is due to the emergence of the atomic bomb. The power of the atomic bomb has the potential to rapidly change the situation. Therefore, in order to secure its position in East Asia, the Soviet Union took action early. Furthermore, it is said that Stalin had proposed that the post-war handling of the East Asian continent be resolved through negotiations between the Soviet Union and Chongqing, and that a second Moscow meeting should be held with Soong Tzu-wen to make a decision. Therefore, before Soong Tzu-wen arrived in Moscow and negotiations began, Soviet troops had already invaded Manchuria. This is because the Soviet Union wanted to create a *fait accompli* by force, creating the impression that the post-war relationship between Chongqing and the Soviet Union would endanger the relationship between Chongqing and the United States, which is causing great unease.

### Japanese Invention of Special Medicine for Treating Burns

Tokyo, 14th (Central News Agency Telegram) – A newly invented Japanese internal medicine has been highly effective in treating burns since the March 10th Tokyo air raid. In particular, it has demonstrated miraculous effects when air-dropped to those injured by the atomic bomb in Hiroshima City. The medicine currently comes in two types: "Rainbow Wave" and "Purple Light." The raw materials for the newly invented medical agent "Rainbow Wave" are chemically synthesized substances from Japanese [unclear] lines and photosensitive pigments, directly collecting the natural power of the sun, pioneering a new field in modern chemistry and realizing the dream of chemists. The harmonizing agents for "Rainbow Wave" number about one hundred, each with its own special efficacy. Currently, "Rainbow Wave No. 1" and "Purple Light" are being used.

### Criticism Arises from All Sides Regarding the Use of the Atomic Bomb

Tokyo, 14th (Central News Agency Telegram) – Currently, various opinions around the world regarding the inhuman act of using the atomic bomb, in addition to newspapers in Switzerland, Sweden, and other neutral countries issuing condemnations, the most influential economic magazine in Britain has also published an article titled "Exposing Anarchy in Civilization" to criticize it. Dr. Ichiro Kiyose, a legal scholar and the Director of the Japan Political Society, has also stated that the use of atomic bombs is a problem that cannot be taken lightly from a humanitarian standpoint, and its use should be completely prohibited to establish morality. According to the British Daily Mail, the British Labour Party has unanimously stated its absolute opposition to the use of atomic bombs. The attitude of British Prime Minister Attlee towards this matter is particularly noteworthy. According to enemy claims, the atomic bomb was only successfully researched on July 15th, but this is mere falsehood. In reality, this bomb was completed long ago. The fact that it was not used on Germany but on Japan is also quite puzzling. It is likely that if it were used on fellow white people, the reaction would be exceptionally strong. Some say that it should be transferred to international administrators, but if that were the case, its free use would not be a problem. Therefore, we must strive to completely eliminate it.

Editorial

### The Lesson of Instability

The fluctuations of the situation and even the spread of rumors often stir up temporary instability in people's hearts, which is a common occurrence. However, this instability can often lead to results that are extremely detrimental to society and the country. Therefore, when dealing with major policies, statesmen must first strive for "composure." Zhuge Liang had the maxim "Tranquility leads to far-reaching vision." When facing powerful enemies, military strategists must first strive for "calmness." Sun Tzu's Art of War has the principle of "Using stillness to control movement." In this era, even if the changes in the situation have varying degrees of urgency, those with common sense and foresight should have already grasped the situation and would not feel surprised. Only those without knowledge or independent judgment would act rashly. However, the instability of a few affects the entire society. The phenomenon of the past few days is a lesson in instability. Because the instability resulted in a disguised state of business suspension, the majority of ordinary people who have no savings to last overnight were plunged into the misery of being cut off from supplies. "Do not forget the past, it is a teacher for the future." We hope that all genuinely patriotic compatriots in the city will, in the future, calmly await the authorities' measures and obey their instructions regarding the changes in the situation, and handle the situation calmly, avoiding further instability and complications.

Chinese merchants, although despised by some politicians and scholars in ancient times, are actually outstanding representatives of the Chinese nation. Although they use profit as a means, their ultimate goal is to trade goods and adjust surpluses and deficits, with established principles of "earning wealth with integrity" and "taking righteousness as profit." Since the opening of maritime trade, they have inevitably been influenced by Western trends and leaned towards individualism and utilitarianism. However, in the eyes of Westerners, Chinese merchants value faith and righteousness above gold, unlike foreigners who must rely on the protection of contracts, which has long been a source of surprise and admiration. Sun Yat-sen even repeatedly cited the morality of Chinese merchants in his famous book "The Three Principles of the People" as evidence of the morality of the Chinese nation. This is something that every Chinese merchant compatriot should respect and value.

However, considering the situation in Shanghai in recent years, we have begun to have great doubts about the so-called morality of Chinese merchants. Because whenever there is a fluctuation in the situation, or purely because of some rumor, before the general public has even reacted, the merchant class is often the first to cause a stir, and then they stir up trouble in the market, raising the prices of all goods and threatening the lives of the general public, resulting in unrest throughout society. Can this kind of opportunistic evil, seeking exorbitant profits, and disregarding the harm to the general public be considered a moral act?

The main reason why merchants are unstable and dare to harm society may be due to unease about the value of the currency in circulation. Based on reliable information we have obtained, the Chinese and Japanese authorities have already discussed stable measures for the future value of the Central Reserve Bank Notes. Regardless of how the situation changes in the future, the current value of the Central Reserve Bank Notes will not be affected. Therefore, we hope that the general merchants will share the difficulties together, demonstrate their inherent moral concepts, resume business as usual, and not repeat the mistakes of the past. At the same time, we further hope that all citizens will not be alarmed by the changes in the situation and rush to purchase goods, which would only lead to a surge in general prices, and ultimately they themselves will inevitably suffer the consequences.

Finally, we believe that in this time of fluctuating circumstances, the Chinese and Japanese authorities in this city must mutually exert their full strength to jointly maintain public order and people's livelihood, in order to reduce the suffering of the people. We must especially prevent those who, through the instigation of a few, are able to cause the misfortune of the suffering of many.

### A Trip to Changzhou: Observations Along the Way

— Xiang Su

Observations Along the Way

Around 7 AM on the third of the month, amidst the misty drizzle, this reporter felt the car arrive at the North Station. It was still early before the train's departure time. I saw a queue of passengers at the gate, not many in number. I easily joined the line and waited to enter the station. Around 8 AM, we slowly moved into the station, where tickets had to be punched. After a while, the ticket inspector arrived, and the line began to stir, with people pushing from the front and squeezing from the back. I spent a great deal of effort pushing through the ticket punch area and quickly headed to the train. After boarding, I saw only a few people, easily counted. I found this odd, as there was no overcrowding, nor the squeezing through windows. After nine o'clock, the train still hadn't departed. I heard an announcement stating that the engine had derailed and would take time to repair. It wasn't until 11:30 AM that we slowly left Shanghai.

Along the way, I saw fields, some yellow, some green, lush and lovely. Three or five farmers, under the blazing sun, toiled in the vast green fields. Next to me sat an old man from the countryside. I asked him about the harvest. He said that the rain had been timely this year, and a good harvest of early rice was expected, adding that the wheat had also been bountiful. Hearing this, I was overjoyed.

The train passed through Henglin, and it was already 3:15 PM. After tidying up my luggage, the train soon arrived in Changzhou. After getting off, I smoothly passed through several checkpoints and hired a rickshaw to head into the city.

Cityscape and Commerce

The city's perimeter is over ten li, bordering the Grand Canal. Since ancient times, it has been known for its culture. During the Qing Dynasty, the Yanghu School, a rival to the Tongcheng School of classical prose, originated here. Now, due to convenient transportation and its advantageous location, it is an important city on the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway and one of the rice-producing areas of Jiangnan. Therefore, its commerce and industry are only slightly behind Suzhou and Wuxi.

After the war, in recent years, efforts have been made to recover, somewhat restoring the past. Especially in the past year, peddlers and returning residents have frequented the streets, bringing much urban style and changing the ancient customs of Lanling (Changzhou's alias). Within Changzhou city, only the north-south main street and Xianzhi Street are the busiest commercial areas. The shops on both sides mostly sell local products, such as combs, silk, leather trunks, woodenware, and painted eggs, which were once famous far and wide, but now sales are far from what they used to be. Apart from the main street, other streets and alleys are narrow and dirty. Especially in the summer, melon rinds litter the roadsides, attracting swarms of flies, which fill the air as pedestrians pass by, with buzzing sounds constantly in the ears. As for street construction, the main streets are paved with gravel, while the alleys are not worth mentioning.

The market is similar to Shanghai, with prices "changing daily" and continuing to rise. Shopkeepers are reluctant to sell their goods because it is difficult to restock after selling their inventory. Therefore, business is generally slow, which is a common phenomenon in all industries. In addition, there are two differences from Shanghai shops: the consumption tax on goods purchased by customers is not collected temporarily but is contracted by the shop from the collection office. The other is that goods are not priced, and although there is a set price list, there is still the problem of overcharging.

There is also a speculative market in Changzhou. Every day from nine o'clock in the morning, many well-dressed figures fill some tea houses and parks, forming an informal speculative market, with gold, cotton yarn, flour, and wheat as targets. They stir up trouble all day long, using long-distance telephones to communicate with Shanghai to set the standard for speculation. Those who engage in this business can become rich overnight or go bankrupt in an instant, depending on their luck.

There are four entertainment venues: Zhonghua, Changzhou, Dahua, and Heping Theatres, etc., which usually show movies and dramas. The films are old ones from Shanghai, and the dramas are amateur performances by the banking industry, with childish acting skills. Tickets are distributed by various guilds. In addition, civil servants and special classes can bring people in and out for free at any time. It is said that those who buy tickets are "fools."

The Prevalence of Lung Disease

It is said that Changzhou is the birthplace of traditional Chinese medicine. Doctors from Menghe (a town ninety li from the city), such as Ma Wenzhi and Fei Boxiong in the Qing Dynasty, were famous for a time. Currently, Changzhou has a health office, headed by Dr. Wang Zeru. In terms of hospitals, there are Wujin Hospital, County Hospital, and Jiangnan Hospital. As for doctors, there are twenty to thirty Western doctors, while traditional Chinese medicine is most prevalent, with two to three hundred registered in the urban area alone (not including rural areas). However, folk medicine such as seeking immortal prescriptions and worshiping gods is still very common. Most of the medicines sold in pharmacies are ready-made, and the prices are twice as high as in Shanghai. The prescription techniques are too immature, so doctors mostly dispense their own medicines.

It is said that the prevalence of lung disease in Changzhou is as common as in Shanghai. However, in today's poor material environment, equipment is not yet widespread, so few are discovered. Even if they are discovered, there are no good sanatoriums for treatment.

Today, the only hospital in Changzhou with X-ray equipment is Wujin Hospital, which holds examinations and artificial pneumothorax injections every Wednesday. There are two people for examinations and injections, which is inevitable. In terms of doctors, Dr. Shen Qanyi, a lung specialist, is the most skilled. He carefully diagnoses and treats the symptoms of patients, which is highly praised by all sectors. Recently, people in Changzhou have become more aware of tuberculosis prevention and need all sectors to promote the establishment of perfect sanatoriums.

A Glimpse of People's Livelihood

Changzhou is also a wealthy area on the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway. Therefore, general prices are always two-thirds cheaper than Shanghai. Recently, due to the influence of peddlers, prices have gradually increased, but they are still half cheaper than Shanghai (except for rice). For example, the prices on August 3rd: japonica rice was 650,000 per stone (150 catties), indica rice was 630,000, soybeans were 260,000, buckwheat was 150,000, wheat was 285,000, and barley was 30,000. In terms of fuel, hard firewood was over 40,000 per dan (balance scale), and bean stalk firewood was over 50,000. Meat was 6,400 yuan per catty, small green vegetables were 1,500 yuan per catty, and water spinach was 1,000 yuan, etc.

On the other hand, the small people spend almost all their daily earnings on exorbitant taxes and forced buying and selling.

Looking at the countryside, it can almost be said that it is bankrupt. The burden of debt per mu of land exceeds the income from the harvest. As for the food eaten by farmers, most of it is wheat dregs and green vegetables. Eating rice is rare.

Locust Plague

In the fourth and fifth districts of the county, in Renxiang Township, large numbers of locusts were found flying from the southwest at the end of last month, harming farmland and greatly affecting people's livelihood. The agencies and the public jointly captured them, and the locusts were removed at the beginning of this month. However, the towns and villages where the locusts stayed are now covered with eggs. Recently, these eggs have hatched into nymphs, which are eating green vegetables. After two molts, they jump nimbly and eat beans, rice, peanuts, and other crops, damaging seedlings even more severely than locusts. Locusts can be driven away to other places, but the wingless nymphs cannot fly away when driven. If you try to kill them, the roads are blocked, and the fields are covered. They are all over the mountains and fields, and it is impossible to kill them all. The farmers there, seeing this situation, all say that the insect plague has become a disaster and the autumn harvest is hopeless, and they are worried day and night. In view of such a disaster, the authorities announced a method of buying nymphs. The nymphs captured by farmers are sold to the authorities for 1,000 yuan per market catty. To date, more than ten thousand catties have been captured, and efforts are being made to eradicate them.

### Defense Lawyer Byrne Vigorously Defends Pétain

Central News Agency, Berne, 14th – According to a Paris report: Pétain's defense lawyer, Byrne, stated during his defense yesterday: "He can gather the testimonies of forty-three defense witnesses." He continued, "When I heard that Prosecutor Monnard wanted to sentence Pétain to death, I could not restrain my grief. I am not defending Pétain's life, but Pétain's reputation. Now, I only hope to do my best today to prove that Pétain is in no way responsible for France's defeat. Those responsible for France's defeat are politicians who slander Pétain." Afterwards, he defended Pétain regarding the signing of the armistice agreement, saying: "Pétain did not abandon the entire France. The signing of this armistice agreement was Pétain's helpless means to protect the common people. No one in Britain condemns me for the armistice agreement. Churchill himself first suggested considering that Britain should agree to France not continuing its anti-war work on March 28, 1940 when necessary. Therefore, Britain cannot be indignant now, and my France has not violated the agreement, nor has it damaged France's prestige." The trial was interrupted at 3:30.

Taiyuan Correspondence

### Talking about Taiyuan in the Hot Summer

— Darlin

Shanxi has been the place of origin of culture since ancient times, especially Taiyuan, the provincial capital, which has been the old capital built by Yao and Shun since ancient times, and is still often compared to the ancient Tang style. Since the Republic of China, especially now, the general culture has gradually shown a downward trend. Jin Yuan, this ancient capital, has always been ignored, especially in the current extraordinary period of war, where the smoke of gunpowder spreads everywhere, people seem to forget it even more, precisely because its environment is close to the deep mountains, and the Li Festival wind blows through every corner, and also blows on the wrinkled face of the ancient Bingzhou; that's right, Taiyuan is lonely and dull, such as the so-called Xinmin Park (Haizi Bian), it is better to say that it is a Haizi Bian than a park, because it is just this mere pool of green water - a pool of dead and smelly green water, but in Taiyuan, it is deeply loved by the general public, especially because of the hot summer bordering the frontiers.

The summer season has become the darling of ancient Taiyuan. It has not only become a popular place for cooling off, but also the only precious place for the general lower-class Jianghu people, trading, and household registration, where all kinds of people from all classes and corners gather, from high-ranking officials and dignitaries to peddlers, all day long. Mixed together, coming and going.

Taiyuan's Crows

Crows are everywhere in Taiyuan, especially in Xinmin Park, which can be said to be its only feature, and because of the lush trees, yes, the garden trees in the park can resist all the streets in the city, perhaps because the streets of Taiyuan are narrow, I really haven't seen a street planted with several tree trunks, even if there are, it's just a few.

Crows are indeed annoying, the croaking and incessant calling always gives people an unpleasant feeling, but here it adds an infinite lively atmosphere to Haizi Bian, but you have to be careful, if you walk under the trees in the evening, you may get hit by crow droppings.

Haizi Bian is like Shichahai

Speaking of the character of Haizi Bian, it is indeed a bit like Beijing's Shichahai in summer, but without its Qing beauty and quietness, it is a bit like Tianqiao, but it has a bit of a park flavor, but it cannot be compared with Tianqiao at the same time. In short, it can be said that it is a place for ten people to take a walk, but it is a bit far-fetched to say that it is a park. It is also forgotten that there is a monument to Governor Su in the inner garden pavilion, which was specially erected by the citizens when Duke Su left the province to commemorate his achievements, which also added a lot of beauty to the circle.

Taiyuan is perhaps too remote and too decadent, and almost all daily necessities, especially those that are slightly more advanced, rely on other places, although the so-called Shanxi industry is very famous, but now it is so poor and pitiful.

Vegetable Prices are Surprisingly High

Even the vegetables that people need most every day come from other provinces, which is a true fact, so it is impossible to eat seasonal fresh vegetables. At the same time, because it comes from other places plus shipping costs, its value is indeed considerable. At this time, almost everyone is still circling around potatoes and spinach every day, and even the usual broad beans are very rare here. I remember in Beijing, at this time, there were already fennel, eggplant, and what kind of cabbage and zucchini filling the vegetable markets. But here, even tomatoes, which are the most popular in summer, are sold for 250 yuan a catty, which Shanghai people would suspect when they hear it. As for watermelons and cantaloupes, which should be available in summer, they are bought by the catty here.

Although there are only a few cold food stores in Taiyuan, the business is unprecedentedly prosperous. Although it is called a cold food store, it is better to say that it is an ice cream store, because it does not sell other cold foods except for this, at most it only comes with two popsicles.

Unexpectedly, the barefoot movement of women is very popular in Taiyuan. Walking on the street, you can see women of all classes exposing their feet and wearing double braids, especially female students wearing green uniforms. There are also many women on the street wearing large floral and green clothes, most of which are remade from old kimonos, which is indeed very novel. The movie theater business is also very prosperous, a movie often runs for half a month or twenty days, and it is always full every day. Now Zhou Xuan's "Fisher Girl" is being shown, and it has been playing for twenty days, and the attendance rate is still not declining. A propaganda agency specially printed a "Fisher Girl Song Page" for this reason, which collected all the songs in the film, a small lithograph, actually selling for ten oceans, and the business is still particularly "prosperous," which is indeed a great strategy for making money.

### Bicycle Industry Guild Enthusiastically Rescuing Students Who Have Dropped Out of School

Hoping that all industry guilds will follow suit. All industries in Shanghai have guilds, but there are not many who can be public-spirited, automatically raise funds to help students. Yesterday, the bicycle industry guild donated 2 million yuan each to the Shen and Xin newspapers' student loan funds. This fund was raised from all members. The person in charge of the guild is enthusiastic about education and has been working hard to appeal, which is truly commendable. After receiving the funds, the colleagues are deeply grateful and express their gratitude on behalf of thousands of children. It is hoped that other industry guilds can also follow suit and be willing to help others. Here is the original letter: "We have long admired your newspaper for running the student loan fund to benefit poor students and cultivate talents. We are very impressed by your enthusiasm and perseverance. Our guild has raised a total of 4 million yuan in Central Reserve Certificates from all members, which will be distributed to your newspaper and the Xinwen Newspaper to rescue students who have dropped out of school, named as the "Bicycle Industry Guild Members Team," to contribute our meager strength. We specially send 2 million yuan in Central Reserve Certificates with this letter, hoping you will accept it."

The International Lecture Hall is Enthusiastic about Helping Students: "We sincerely admire your esteemed hall for holding student loans to benefit poor students and your enthusiasm for public welfare. Here is a check for 100,000 Central Reserve Certificates, hoping you will accept it and name it the Pharmacy Team, and we pray for your good governance. A small amount, just to contribute our meager strength."

### Municipal Authorities Advise All Industries to Open as Usual; Commodity Prices Already Falling Yesterday

Due to the recent rumors, ignorant merchants and civilians in this city were frightened, causing a chaotic situation. Market speculators took the opportunity to incite price hikes, and even many industrial, commercial factories and companies closed down for no reason and refused to sell goods. In order to maintain social and economic order and stabilize people's livelihoods, the municipal authorities ordered the Municipal Economic Bureau and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to convene responsible persons from various industry guilds, urging all member firms to abide by laws and regulations, not to believe rumors lightly, and to operate normal businesses. It is learned that yesterday (the 14th), all companies and firms in this city complied with the order and opened for business as usual, and retail prices were stable, sweeping away the chaotic phenomenon. Banks and money houses opened as usual, handling payment and receipt business, and the prices of grain and various food items fell significantly, and people's hearts were becoming stable.

### Provisional Measures for Manufacturers to Adjust Sales Prices; Intentional Overcharging Will Be Punished

The Municipal Economic Bureau recently drafted the following provisional measures for manufacturers in Shanghai Special Municipality to apply for sales price adjustments:

(1) The fixed price shall be assessed by the Commodity Price Assessment Committee (hereinafter referred to as the "Price Assessment Committee"), and the agreed price shall be approved by the Economic Bureau.

(2) The scope of fixed and agreed-price materials shall be divided in accordance with the Provisional Regulations on Wartime Price Management of the Ministry of Industry.

(3) If a manufacturer applies for a sales price adjustment due to changes in the cost of its products, it shall prepare an accurate cost calculation statement, attach relevant documents, and submit them to the relevant industry guild for review.

(4) The guild shall immediately conduct a detailed investigation based on the member's cost calculation statement, convene a meeting for careful discussion, and then submit the meeting minutes and relevant documents to the Price Assessment Committee or the Economic Bureau for review and approval.

(5) If the Price Assessment Committee or the Economic Bureau deems the cost calculation statement in the preceding paragraph to be reasonable after review, it shall approve it for record. However, if it deems it to be insufficient, it may revise and amend the sales price accordingly.

(6) When applying for a sales price adjustment, manufacturers or guilds shall submit the cost calculation statement and documents to the Price Assessment Committee or the Economic Bureau seven days in advance for review. All fixed and agreed-price new price lists shall not be implemented without formal approval and record. Violators shall be dealt with as exceeding the limit price.

(7) Regarding sales price adjustments, if a guild abuses its authority to intentionally manipulate or raise prices in order to deceive and profit, once verified, all responsible persons of the guild shall bear joint and several liability and be subject to severe punishment in accordance with the law.

(8) Once the new price list is approved and announced, it shall be strictly enforced and shall not be exceeded, and an application for adjustment shall not be made again for at least one month. However, in special circumstances, a statement of reasons may be made, and it may be handled in a flexible manner after special approval.

### A Citizen Donates Two Hundred Million Yuan for Disaster Relief

It has been found that donations to the Air Raid Relief Fund from all sectors of this city are quite enthusiastic. In addition to being collected and forwarded by major newspapers and relevant agencies, it is learned that a certain citizen from the Municipal Finance Bureau has separately donated two hundred million yuan to the relief fund, which has been forwarded by the bureau to the Municipal Air Defense Headquarters.

### Increased Exchange of Bank and Money Shop Instruments

Due to the increasing volume of negotiable instruments, the banking and money shop industries in this city have implemented a next-day exchange system for instruments, hoping to resolve all difficulties arising from them. However, these difficulties have not only failed to decrease but have, in fact, become more pronounced than before. It is understood that banks are experiencing multiplied difficulties in collection, transfer, and exchange due to the increased volume of instruments from fellow institutions. In addition to significantly increasing staff at the Clearing House and strengthening exchange operations, they have also recently implemented a preliminary exchange among correspondent institutions to ensure complete procedures before the formal exchange takes place. Unofficial estimates suggest that the interbank instrument exchange rate for the past month increased by approximately 250% to 300% compared to the previous month. This is because the money shops' instrument exchange figures for the past month have already increased by over 250%, and the banks' increase is undoubtedly higher than that of the money shops. Investigations reveal that the main reason for the sharp increase in instruments for both industries is the rising prices, which have caused the value of instruments to increase in proportion to the rise in prices. The so-called shortage of cash is only a secondary factor.

### Stock Exchange Suspends Afternoon Trading

The authorities of the Chinese Stock Exchange have temporarily suspended afternoon trading starting yesterday (the 14th) due to extremely chaotic market trading.

The securities authorities issued a notice, the original text of which is as follows: "Upon investigation, 22 brokers have had their submitted settlement payments returned due to insufficient funds, requiring immediate clearing. Afternoon sessions are hereby temporarily suspended. This is a public notice."

### Gold and Securities Market Conditions

The gold and securities market opened slightly lower yesterday compared to the previous day. Although there was a slight rebound in the middle, the closing price still showed a small squeeze. Expiring securities were not traded. Prices are recorded as follows:

Expiring—Not Opened.

Fifth Issue opened at 8.4 million yuan, highest at 8.5 million yuan, lowest at 8 million yuan, closed at 8.5 million yuan, down 3 million yuan from the previous day, with a trading volume of 120 taels.

### Self-Healing Through Illness

— Chen Bennian

I live at 103 Chongqing Road, near the Yinshi Jingxue Society. I had long wanted to learn there, but was delayed by mundane affairs until I joined the sixth class in the autumn of the 33rd year. At first, when I sat, I felt all kinds of thoughts gathering, and my mind was unsettled. Moreover, my legs were not used to sitting cross-legged, and the soreness and numbness were unbearable. I asked Teacher Jiang, who said that I would get used to it over time, and not to be afraid or discouraged. After two months, among the dozens of people sitting together, one person sitting in front of me had a slight swaying of his shoulders and back.

I returned to Ningbo to care for my sick mother, serving her with medicine and soup. After my mother passed away, filled with sorrow, I returned to Shanghai and diligently practiced. On the morning of the third day after the Mid-Autumn Festival, at 6:00 AM, while meditating, I suddenly felt my legs shaking uncontrollably. At first, I thought it was caused by numbness, but gradually the vibration spread to my chest and abdomen. My hands slipped out of their grip and began to rotate like a windmill, embracing the air. The rotation was both clockwise and counterclockwise, each for thirty-six turns. My head also swayed from side to side and back and forth, also thirty-six times. That morning, I rushed to Teacher Jiang to report what had happened. He said: "This is the initial vibration." The next day, when the class met, my vibrations were so strong that the furnishings in the room shook. My classmates, seeing my rapid progress, secretly asked if I had any secret methods. I replied that I only worked hard and had no other secrets.

On the night of the winter solstice, alone in bed, I lay on my back without crossing my legs and tried to perform the practice. I was also able to vibrate, and gradually felt soreness in the tailbone area, with heat rising directly up my back, causing my shoulders and back to sway continuously, straight up to the neck bones, from the head to the eyebrows. Then my eyes opened and closed uncontrollably, sometimes wide open, and my eyeballs rotated left and right. The vibration branched down from the nose, and the nose also vibrated, down to the upper and lower jaws, and the cheeks and jawbones all vibrated. I remained calm and composed. At that time, the tip of my tongue, which was originally pressed tightly against the inner roof of my mouth, suddenly vibrated, stirring and stretching uncontrollably, and gradually I became calm, returning from the chest and abdomen to the dantian below the navel. Fearing that this phenomenon was only occasional, I did not dare to immediately report to the teacher. But it happened every time I sat, so I told the teacher in the society. The teacher was amazed, saying that no one had had such a rapid effect except for Shen Yinmei. "Your three gates are open, take good care of yourself."

In the society, I met Brother Sun Daosheng, who had already studied the Great Zhou Tian Bao. He told the teacher: "On the night of the winter solstice, there was a strange phenomenon, with heat condensing and moving up and down between the dantians." The teacher said: "This is the sign of the initial formation of the small elixir, and you are one level ahead of us." Meditation is a method of preventing illness and prolonging life. Prolonging life depends on each person's foundation, but preventing illness is something everyone can achieve. The sickness of a sick person is precisely the right medicine.

National Forum

### Some Opinions on Evacuation Issues

— Chen Tianzhuo

Evacuating the population is currently the most important and necessary issue. The authorities have repeatedly warned citizens to evacuate as soon as possible, and various people have also advised and proposed evacuation methods in newspapers.

Originally, evacuating the population is not a difficult task. What people leaving Shanghai and what happens after leaving Shanghai, therefore the people who want to evacuate are just unable to evacuate. I humbly offer my views below:

1.  Ensure the Safety of Evacuation: Many people who want to evacuate are afraid to leave Shanghai, either because they are afraid of the danger along the way, or because they are afraid of kidnapping and robbery in the places they arrive. To achieve the purpose of evacuation, the authorities must provide armed escorts to ensure evacuation and unite with the military police in various places to eliminate all obstacles in the evacuation areas.

2.  Reward Companies to Invest and Assist in Evacuation: When the government determines that a certain place is geographically suitable, a suitable evacuation area should be established. Companies should be rewarded for investing in construction and developing housing and other productive enterprises. The companies themselves can profit, and at the same time, the cost and actual production of evacuating people can be reduced.

3.  Unite Various Hometown Associations to Assist in Evacuation: Hometown associations are more likely to contact their fellow townsmen in Shanghai. At the same time, group evacuation is generally cheaper than individual evacuation. Many Shanghai residents who are relatively close to their hometowns are unemployed but have the strength to return home. Efforts should be made to provide free transportation back. I believe the number will be considerable. As for people whose hometowns are far away, such as those from Fujian, Guangdong, Hunan, and Sichuan, if they are to be evacuated to their respective hometowns, the journey of life is not easy. Moreover, rural people often show strangeness and suspicion towards outsiders, especially we Cantonese, who are very distinct in our language, attitude, and appearance. Unless nothing happens in the future, otherwise they are likely to be the first to be targeted. If there is a group evacuation with fellow townsmen, it is much cheaper in terms of travel expenses, communication, and solidarity and safety.

4.  Prioritize the Evacuation of Women and Children: The biggest difficulty in evacuation is the life after evacuation, which is why many people hesitate. Therefore, I propose to start with the evacuation of women and children, while those who support their families can still work in Shanghai, so that they can continue to maintain their own and their families' lives. Therefore, the authorities should first find ways to evacuate women and children, which is the first step in solving the evacuation problem.

5.  Ensure Remittances: After evacuation, it is natural to need financial support for living, so first stabilize remittances. The authorities should instruct the Central Bank and other banks to set up special remittance departments in various evacuation areas. The remittance procedures should be quick and reliable. If necessary, the bank should advance money in case the remittance does not arrive or other events prevent the remittance.

6.  Protect Convenient Transportation: Evacuation requires transportation. The convenience of transportation does not need to be the same as usual, but there must be no obstacles, such as black market tickets, difficult and extortionate transportation workers, and revitalization of water transport, all of which must be improved. At the same time, daily necessities must also be facilitated. If one can only evacuate to a certain place alone, and then needs to purchase new furniture and supplies, and the inland is expensive and lacking, it is not something that the average person can afford.

7.  Organize Evacuated People's Self-Defense Groups: After evacuation, the strength of the group is greater and communication is easier. For the sake of safety after evacuation, the government should guide the evacuated people to organize self-defense groups in the evacuation areas, using the power of the masses to defend themselves.

8.  Relocation of Industrial and Commercial Institutions: After the evacuation of the people, the evacuation areas will naturally prosper with the population. Then, industrial and commercial institutions can also be relocated accordingly. At the same time, the employees serving in these institutions can also be evacuated accordingly. In this way, some special cities will be formed in various rural areas.

9.  Evacuation Costs: The evacuation costs should be as economical and common as possible. If the people are required to bear too large a number, the plan is equal to empty talk on paper. Someone once proposed to use Taihu Lake as an evacuation area, with an evacuation fee of 500,000 yuan per person (at that time, rice was only 40,000 yuan per dan). That is really not too universal in the current social environment. For example, a family of ten would cost 5 million, and a family of five would cost 2.5 million. Apart from a few people who can afford it, I believe that 95% of Shanghai people cannot afford it. The retirement pay of ordinary shops in Shanghai is mostly two to six months' salary, and the most is only 300,000 to 400,000 yuan. At the same time, it can also be seen that Shanghai people are physically weak due to insufficient economic strength. Everyone may not notice it, but whether in the theater or in the church, the sound of coughing is always incessant, either in front or behind, and the ears are noisy. This is a disease caused by insufficient nutrition. Even eating is not enough, so where is there extra money to evacuate? This is a big problem in evacuating the population of Shanghai. So how to evacuate? Now I propose several easy and practical methods below for future reference and implementation by the relevant authorities:

    1.  Determine the evacuation locations.
    2.  Unite the hometown associations and Baojia to register evacuated women, children, the old, and the weak.
    3.  Establish stable remittance agencies.
    4.  The authorities should select excellent police officers (or use those who have been laid off) to organize evacuation guard teams to protect the evacuation.
    5.  Eliminate all illegal difficulties and extortions.
    6.  Goods from Shanghai to the evacuation areas should be tax-free and freely transported.
    7.  The authorities should negotiate with China Railway to allocate some passenger tickets, which will be distributed to the evacuees by the evacuation committee.
    8.  Investigate, reward, or order enterprises and industrial companies that have surplus funds but do not engage in production and tend to speculation and hoarding to invest in evacuation undertakings.
    9.  Organize wooden boat transportation companies and wooden boat manufacturing plants to facilitate water transportation.
    10. Unite reclamation, agricultural, and construction companies to engage in land reclamation, planting, and housing construction in the evacuation areas.
    11. Recruit unemployed laborers in Shanghai to engage in land reclamation and evacuation undertakings.
    12. The government authorities should unite with the hometown associations to provide financial assistance to those who cannot afford to return home.

The above twelve methods are the most basic and easy to implement methods for evacuation. If the authorities are determined to implement them, then the evacuation problem will be easily solved.

### The Importance and Methods of Evacuating Schools

— Lu Shinting

Newspapers have been publishing exhortations to evacuate the population for months now. However, citizens have been slow to move, with very few complying. The reasons are no more than the following three: 1. Rural life is not as comfortable as in Shanghai. 2. Lack of money, difficult travel, or no means of making a living after evacuation. 3. Children are studying in Shanghai, and evacuation would interrupt their studies, hence the hesitation. Furthermore, the population of Shanghai is very large, so why worry? They console themselves. However, this is no longer the case. The environment makes it impossible for us to stay any longer, so the first reason or excuse no longer exists, and the second reason is being overcome; as for what is not easy to overcome, it is really the third reason.

If schools are not evacuated, most students will not dare to leave without permission, and if students do not dare to leave without permission, their families will certainly not leave Shanghai, so it is difficult to achieve the goal of evacuating the population. If schools can be evacuated, then students will certainly have no intention of being unruly, and students' families will certainly make plans to return to their hometowns, and the goal of evacuating the population will be easily achieved. Therefore, evacuating schools is the most urgent and important issue today, and should be evacuated before other groups.

The general public's view is that evacuating schools is impossible in reality: how to move school buildings, school equipment, teachers, students, and the families of teachers and students? The enormous cost is more than ten million? It is practically impossible to move, so it has not been evacuated to this day.

But this is wrong! The method of evacuating schools is not like this. In other words, evacuating schools is simply "dissolving Shanghai schools and establishing rural schools." The schools in Shanghai should be declared dissolved as soon as possible to strengthen the determination of students and their families to return to their hometowns, and to issue appropriate funds so that teachers can take their families back to their hometowns or choose a place to evacuate. When they arrive in the countryside, they can rent temples, churches, and the remaining houses of large families to open small-scale schools, following the old-fashioned style while implementing the new education system. The education authorities can send inspectors to travel between villages and towns to be responsible for guidance; when the time is right, implement examinations, and issue certificates to those who pass, so as not to waste the time of evacuation.

School work should start with the municipal education bureau, with municipal schools setting an example and taking the lead, and private schools will certainly follow suit. If this can be done, not only will students and their families be able to evacuate with peace of mind, but the backward rural areas can also be rid of the stale air of the new education. In other words, the level of Chinese culture will be "revived" as a result.

### Provisional Regulations for the Management of Piers

It is noted that the existing Regulations for the Management of Piers in this city were drafted by the former Bureau of Public Works in July of the 31st year [of the Republic of China, i.e., 1942] and submitted to the Municipal Government for approval and promulgation. It has come to our attention that the Municipal Government believes these regulations, having been in use for three years, are largely inconsistent with the current situation. Since the former Bureau of Public Works was dissolved and its duties transferred to the Bureau of Construction, the management of piers has been handled by the Bureau of Construction. Therefore, the functions and powers stipulated in the original regulations need to be revised to adapt to current needs. The revised Provisional Regulations for the Management of Piers of the Shanghai Special Municipality are hereby promulgated and appended below:

Chapter 1: General Provisions

Article 1: The Shanghai Special Municipal Government enacts these provisional regulations to manage the piers within the city limits.

Article 2: All piers within this Special Municipality, whether publicly owned, municipally owned, self-built, or leased, shall have their ownership and future disposition rights wholly vested in the municipality. Their management shall be conducted entirely in accordance with these regulations.

Article 3: Piers that have already been self-built or leased before the promulgation of these regulations must uniformly complete the procedures in accordance with these regulations and apply to the Bureau of Construction for registration.

Chapter 2: Self-Built Piers

Article 4: Anyone intending to self-build a pier along a river or the Jiang [Yangtze River] within this Special Municipality must proceed according to the Regulations for Citizens of this City Requesting the Construction of Roads, Bridges, Piers, and Embankments, and comply with the provisions of these regulations. They must also submit a detailed list of the following items to the Bureau of Construction for dispatching personnel to inspect and approve before construction can begin:

(1) Name of the owner or company; (2) License for using the shoreline; (3) Stone construction drawings; (4) Purpose of the pier.

Article 5: Once the Bureau of Construction approves the reported self-built pier, it will issue a pier license, the form of which will be determined separately.

Article 6: Upon completion of the pier construction, the Bureau of Construction should be notified to dispatch personnel for inspection. If the construction does not conform to the approved drawings, the Bureau of Construction may order its reconstruction.

Article 7: The materials used for the pier construction must be durable. If a fixed pier is built for the purpose of allowing ships to dock for passenger and cargo embarkation and disembarkation, its pilings, steps, and supports should be made of reinforced concrete. The pier surface must not exceed the road surface.

Article 8: If there are any changes in the pier operation, or if damage occurs or circumstances arise that could easily lead to danger, it should be reported to the authorities for handling immediately. Otherwise, in addition to forfeiting the deposit, the license will be revoked.

Chapter 3: Leased Piers

Article 9: Municipal piers, except those used by the competent authority, may be leased periodically by various shipping companies according to the following procedures.

Article 10: To lease a municipal pier periodically, a written application should be submitted requesting the Bureau of Construction to approve the location and lease term, and a contract should be signed. However, the lease term shall not exceed five years. Upon expiration, if the Municipal Government does not reclaim it for its own use, an application may be made for continued lease.

Article 11: Lessees of municipal piers shall pay rent according to the following schedule:

Pier Use: (Category A) Loading and unloading passengers and cargo; (Category B) Loading and unloading cargo

Annual Rent: (A) 28,800; (B) 19,200; Four-Year Rent: (A) 92,160; (B) 61,440

Two-Year Rent: 55,440; 33,440; Five-Year Rent: 100,800; 867,200

Three-Year Rent: 77,760; 51,840

The rent amounts listed above are calculated per meter. Any fraction less than one meter should be counted as one meter.

Article 12: After the lease contract for a municipal pier is signed, the lessee shall prepay one year's rent and a deposit to the Bureau of Construction. The deposit shall be equal to one year's rent.

Article 13: Upon expiration of the approved lease term, if the lessee does not apply for continued lease, the deposit paid should be refunded in full.

Chapter 4: Pier Berthing

Article 14: Ships berthing at piers, except for shipping companies that have entered into a lease contract, shall pay berthing fees.

Article 15: If a ship intends to berth at a municipal pier, it shall complete a berthing request form three hours in advance and submit it to the Pier Management Office of the Bureau of Construction for approval. Only after a berthing assignment slip is issued may the ship berth at the assigned pier. The berthing fee shall be paid to the Pier Management Office of the Bureau of Construction in accordance with the regulations. The regulations on berthing fees shall be determined separately.

Article 16: Public vessels of various government agencies berthing at municipal piers for official business may be exempt from berthing fees upon verification and permission by the Pier Management Office of the Bureau of Construction, but the berthing time shall not exceed two hours.

Article 17: Ships berthing at piers shall not, except under special circumstances, exceed the position of their assigned pier, thereby obstructing the berthing of other companies' ships.

Article 18: If a ship berthing at a municipal pier damages the pier or its auxiliary facilities, the shipping company shall be responsible for compensation and repair.

Article 19: Matters concerning mooring and unmooring of ships berthing at piers shall be handled by personnel dispatched by the Pier Management Office of the Bureau of Construction. Crew members shall not berth or move lines without authorization.

Chapter 5: General Management Rules

Article 20: Companies operating shipping businesses shall report the following circumstances to the competent authority for handling, regardless of whether the pier is self-built, leased, or used for berthing:

(1) When public security and order on the pier are disrupted. (2) When illegal smuggling of contraband is discovered. (3) When reactionary elements endangering the country and society infiltrate or escape.

Article 21: All shipping company personnel, outdoor staff, and stevedores on the piers shall wear uniforms prescribed by the Bureau of Construction and shall be subject to the direction of the personnel of the Pier Management Office of the Bureau of Construction.

Article 22: Passengers embarking and disembarking, and cargo being loaded and unloaded, on the pier shall enter and exit according to the entrance and exit signs of the Bureau of Construction.

Article 23: Shipping companies shall not arbitrarily pile up goods near the pier, nor shall they dump garbage, coal slag, bricks, mud, or waste into the water.

Article 24: Goods are not allowed to be piled up on floating piers and floating bridges.

Article 25: Commercial vehicles, unless hired, are not allowed to remain within the pier area.

Article 26: Mobile vendors who have not been specially registered and permitted by the Bureau of Construction are not allowed to sell goods in the pier area.
