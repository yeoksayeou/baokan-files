### The Authorities are Considering Food Policy Measures as the New Harvest Season Approaches: Procurement Agencies Still Divided Between Military and Civilian Needs

Nanjing, 25th (Central News Agency) – In early June, the National Government resolutely abolished the original restrictions on the movement of rice in order to stabilize the rice supply and people's food security, and allowed free transportation and sales. At the same time, Allied military and political authorities also sincerely assisted by ceasing to purchase military rice. Since then, rice prices in Nanjing, Shanghai, and other places have stabilized somewhat, which was essential during this lean period. However, these measures were temporary in nature. As the new harvest season approaches, the authorities are considering future food policy measures. It is rumored that the principle of regional procurement will remain, and the procurement agencies will still be divided between military and civilian needs. The people of the country are deeply concerned about this. The main reasons why previous food policy measures failed to achieve the expected results were the unsound personnel system, the lack of unified laws and regulations, and, most importantly, the fundamental disorder and disarray in the procurement system and distribution agencies, which prevented unified procurement, distribution, and operation. Therefore, the people sincerely hope that the authorities will carefully examine past advantages and disadvantages and carefully consider future policies to avoid repeating past mistakes.

### Posthumous Awards for Brave Warriors Killed in Action in the East Asian War: Colonel Mori Katsura and Others Honored; Announced by the Decoration Bureau and the Ministry of the Army

Tokyo, 25th (Central News Agency) – On the 26th, His Imperial Majesty the Emperor posthumously awarded honors to those who died in action in the 31st Great East Asian War related to the Army. This undertaking was conducted by the Decoration Bureau and concerned individuals who fought bravely on the Chinese mainland and in the Southwest Pacific after the outbreak of the Great East Asian War and ultimately sacrificed their lives for the country, including military personnel and civilians attached to units in Manchuria and the mainland. Among them, one hundred and fifty individuals, including bomber unit commander Colonel Mori Katsura, who was awarded the Special Service Merit Class A for his exceptional military achievements, participated in aerial operations multiple times and established distinguished military exploits. He unfortunately died in action on August 3 last year during an attack on the Ankang airfield in Shaanxi Province. This group of distinguished individuals also includes eighty-seven individuals, including Major Takahashi Suemasu, who rammed an enemy warship off the coast of Taiwan.

### General Okamura's Statement Acknowledged by American Commentator

Central News Agency Dispatch – General Okamura, Commander-in-Chief of the Japanese Expeditionary Army in China, made a statement to a group of Chinese reporters on the 9th of this month stating that "it will take approximately two years for the Japanese army to completely withdraw with its weapons." This statement has attracted considerable attention both domestically and internationally. According to a broadcast from San Francisco, the well-known American military commentator Lawrence wrote in the New York Daily News that General Okamura's statement that it would take two years for the Japanese army to withdraw from China is indeed not a lie. This is because there are very few ships available now. Even if the million or more Japanese troops were not attacked by American forces, it would be impossible to assist in the defense of Japan and return home, even with the use of ships. General Okamura's conclusion is that "it is better for the Japanese army not to withdraw." Regardless of whether this commentary is related to some kind of peace movement, various parties here almost unanimously believe that it is a militarily correct measure.

### Guangdong and Macau Establish Trade Measures

### Armed Conflict Between Chongqing and Communist Forces in the Wei River Delta; Both Sides Massing Troops, Serious Situation

Central News Agency Dispatch from Shanghai – According to information arriving here, the 59th Division of Hu Zongnan's army, which crossed the Jing River in central Shaanxi Province and continued to gather on the north bank, suddenly guarded the Yaoxian and Chunhua areas and launched an attack on the Yan'an army. At the same time, it challenged the Yan'an army defending Jingyang and Xingping. The Wei River delta and the Jing and Luo River areas have become fierce battlefields. Because the Chongqing army has American equipment, it is reported that the Yan'an army suffered considerable casualties as of the 23rd. A formal civil war has begun. Furthermore, the Chongqing army has stopped passenger train service on the entire Longhai Railway line and continues to transport troops from that direction, increasing its forces to nine divisions. On the other hand, Yan'an has also begun to mobilize the 18th Group Army from the Jicha Border Region, and the situation is gradually deteriorating.

Central News Agency Dispatch from Shanghai – According to a New China News Agency dispatch from Yan'an on the 23rd, on the 21st, the 59th Division of the Chongqing army suddenly launched a fierce artillery attack on Yetaishan in Chunyao County, the garrison area of the Communist army in the Guanzhong District of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region. The Communist army, adhering to the principle of defending its positions, has not yet launched a counterattack. The fighting had not stopped as of the 23rd. In response, the Yan'an side believes that the Chongqing authorities have launched a large-scale attack on the border region and is extremely angry. On the 23rd, in the name of Zhu De and Peng Dehuai, the Commander-in-Chief and Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the 18th Group Army, a telegram was sent to Chiang Kai-shek, Chairman of the Military Affairs Commission, and Hu Zongnan, Commander of the First War Zone in Xi'an, demanding a halt to this attack. According to the New China News Agency, the full text of the telegram is as follows: "According to reports from the Guanzhong Sub-district of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region, a sudden change has occurred in Xi'an in the past week. Anti-communist voices are rampant, and the majority of troops are gradually moving from the anti-Japanese front line in the area of Shaan County and Lingbao. Commercial transportation on the Longhai Railway has been suspended, and troops are being transported day and night. Nine divisions—the 1st Division of the 1st Army, the 7th Division of the 3rd Army, the Provisional 26th Division of the 7th Army, the 1st Reserve Division and 3rd Reserve Division of the 16th Army, the 52nd Division of the 36th Army, the 59th Division, the 37th Provisional Division and the 165th Division of the 80th Army—have been deployed in the areas of Tongguan, Yaoxian, Jingyang, Qianxian, and Xingping, with the slogans of 'Anti-communism First, Anti-Japanese Second,' to attack the border region, attempting to slaughter Communists. On July 21, the 59th Division suddenly attacked the Yetaishan area in Yaoxian, in our border region. Fierce fighting has been ongoing for three days, with no sign of stopping. Considering that a major enemy is currently present, the fate of the nation is related to the solidarity of the Kuomintang and the Communist Party. At a time when the Allied forces are moving from east to west, and our country is adjusting internally to cooperate with the Allied forces in a counterattack against the enemy, we are suddenly shocked by the alarm of civil war. These troops have no intention other than defending their territory. We hereby send this telegram in the hope of stopping this and await a reply."

According to the Communist side's statement, there have been 106 attacks by the Chongqing army involving more than 1,000 troops each against the Communist army from June of last year to May of this year. Entering this year, frequent attacks occurred in Wangjiang County in Anhui Province, the western part of Zhejiang Province, and other locations. This time, the Chongqing army's attack on the Communist army, at a location 200 kilometers from Yan'an, constitutes a direct attack on the Communist Party's base in the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region, and the Communist side attaches great importance to the situation.

### Various Aspects of Wujiang

— Straightforward

Anyone familiar with the situation in Jiangsu generally knows that there is a peculiar phenomenon in the towns of Wujiang. That is, the towns are better than the county seat, and the towns surpass the urban area in terms of market conditions and wealth.

### Rich Towns, Poor County

Wujiang is a first-class county in Jiangsu Province, with jurisdiction over nine districts and more than one hundred townships. Logically, the market conditions in the county seat should be quite prosperous, but this is not the case. Apart from North Tang Street, which has a few small shops, only the markets outside the East Gate and North Gate are relatively lively, but they are nothing more than general merchandise stores and traditional Chinese medicine shops. The reasons for this can be divided into two categories: First, most of the towns under its jurisdiction are too rich. For example, the four major towns of Shengze, Zhenze, Tongli, and Pingwang are each richer than the county seat, and the villagers do not need to come to the city to purchase goods. Second, it is too close to Suzhou, only thirty-six miles away. When the Sujia Road was open, it only took half an hour to reach. If residents need anything, they can go to Suzhou to buy it. Even now that the Sujia Road is closed, there are still wooden engine boats on the waterways, and rickshaws and cars on the land routes, so the county seat's urban landscape has never prospered.

### Decline of the Silk Industry

Wujiang and its affiliated towns have always been famous for producing silk, especially Shengze and Zhenze, which are the best in the county. Anyone who pays a little attention to domestic products will have heard of "Shengze cloth" and "Qili silk," which are special products of this county. In addition to Shengze and Zhenze, Yanmu, Pingwang, and other towns also produce a large amount of silk, so there are many mulberry fields in the area, and there are quite a few silkworm farmers who depend on it for a living. Speaking of this year's spring silkworms, it is very miserable. Because of the scarcity of silkworm eggs this year (the reason for the scarcity is that the silkworm eggs coming from the east this year were particularly few, and the domestic silkworm egg production farms, based on the lessons learned from the dumping of silkworm eggs from the east last year, produced even fewer eggs this year, so a shortage of silkworm eggs was formed), the price of silkworm eggs also skyrocketed. For example, Shouxing brand eggs were even raised to over 10,000 in some places. In the last few days, as long as silkworm farmers had eggs, even the miscellaneous brands that were ignored last year were treated as rare commodities this year. Even so, the shortage of silkworm eggs is an undeniable fact, and the mulberry fields are also overabundant. When silkworms first started hatching, mulberry leaves were 2,000 yuan per dan (unit of weight), but when the silkworm season was coming to an end, the price even dropped to 1,000 yuan per dan, and no one cared about them. This phenomenon is probably unprecedented in recent years!

Wujiang has fertile land, and a considerable amount of rice is also produced, so the results of this autumn rice procurement are quite good. Before the National Government issued the order to stop purchasing rice, the farmers were extremely distressed because the rice procurement was not limited to a certain number of times. With procurement going on three or four times… the farmers naturally became poorer day by day.

### Public Security Situation

The area of Wujiang County is quite large, formed by the merger of the former Zhenze and Wujiang counties, divided into nine districts and more than one hundred townships. The district and township chiefs of each district and township are mostly very capable because they are directly related to the farmers. Of course, they can directly extract revenue from the farmers, without having to go around the bend. The three dou of rice can be obtained on time, without defaulting for several months like this. However, the affairs of the district office are also quite busy, such as building roads, dispatching laborers, and supplying firewood to various institutions, all of which are the responsibility of the district office. Some clerks in the district office act arrogantly and even beat up farmers after drinking and indulging in drugs. It is hoped that the county government will pay special attention when selecting local grass-roots administrative personnel.

The public security situation is also different from the past. Due to the difficulties of life and various exploitations, more and more people are gradually taking risks. Armed robberies can often be heard. For example, after Shengze Town was robbed last month, Tongli Town soon after had a daylight robbery and the murder of the manager of Houzhuang. And in the prosperous Chengtuanzhou outside the East Gate of Wujiang City, fifteen families were robbed in one night. However, this is just the beginning. If life cannot be improved and the people's minimum living needs cannot be met, no one dares to say what will happen in the future.

### Rampant Gambling

Gambling is very prevalent in the urban and rural areas of Wujiang now, which is also a symbol that farmers' lives are depressed and cannot be vented. They know how dangerous gambling is, but they are holding onto the "drinking poison to quench thirst" to give a deep stimulation to nerves that have been oppressed for a long time. In addition, the promotion of the local special class is also one of the reasons. For example, when a small event such as a wedding or funeral occurs in the locality, they always set up a few so-called large tables, attracting a group of weak-willed people to flock to them. There are many who are ruined by this.

Rice straw ash is flying all over the streets of Wujiang. Such a large park is unattended, so that a bird-catching magpie that should be caught by children has lost all its tiles. But what is most inappropriate is that the firefighting equipment is imperfect. There is not a single repaired fire hydrant in the city. If there is a fire, is it not just watching it burn? It is hoped that the Wujiang County Government can do its best to improve this!

Wujiang's cultural aspect is terribly poor. Although there is a complete middle school, a rural normal school attached to the Jiangsu Provincial College of Education, and several elementary schools in the urban area, there are not many students, and there is not even one bookstore that sells magazines and books. From this, it can be seen what the cultural level of this county seat is. In terms of newspapers, there is only one Wujiang Public Newspaper (octavo), a ten-day publication, and what is published is also the resolutions of the county government. There is very little news.

The price of food is relatively low now. The price of rice is about 390,000, and wheat is about 170,000. Now the Jiangsu Provincial Government plans to use the abandoned Sujia Road to cultivate land to increase production. This is, of course, an excellent business, and it can be written when the date is coming.

### Gold Prices and Commodity Prices

In recent days, the skyrocketing of gold prices has become the focus of speculative capital. Because of the skyrocketing of gold prices, various commodity prices have also followed suit, posing a serious threat to the lives of ordinary citizens.

To curb the rise in commodity prices, we must first curb the skyrocketing of gold prices. The reasons for the skyrocketing of gold prices: First, it must be admitted that the rise in the issue price of gold securities in each period is a stimulus. Second, the rampant speculation and artificial manipulation. When we study the actual reasons for the skyrocketing of gold prices, the former seems to be the superficial reason, only triggering the motive, and the latter is the real cause, riding the tide and triggering such a climax. However, the relationship between the two is actually very close because the rise in the issue price of gold securities creates an opportunity for speculators. We must review this to curb the skyrocketing of gold prices.

There are various discussions about curbing the skyrocketing of gold prices. Some people believe that the future issuance of gold securities should also be considered. However, the original intention of issuing gold securities is to recover part of the reserve coupons, on the one hand, to reduce the development of currency inflation, and on the other hand, to be used as funds for purchasing materials, which is not controversial in principle. However, if it is done too hastily, it becomes a reason to promote the skyrocketing of gold prices, and the rise in commodity prices caused by the skyrocketing of gold prices actually exceeds the impact of currency inflation that can be reduced by the reserve coupons recovered by the gold securities. We believe that the gold securities system is an important creation of the monetary authorities, and the decision on the price of gold securities should be deeply researched. Future conversion must be premised on curbing the skyrocketing of gold prices.

Some people think that gold bullion can be suppressed with strong force. However, we now hope that the authorities can reasonably regulate gold prices rather than hope that the authorities will use administrative power. As the Continental New Daily argues, if normal gold bullion trading turns into black market trading due to suppression, then control will be even more difficult, and we firmly believe that this is the case. Moreover, the three principles proposed by the Continental New Daily can indeed be used as a reference for this decision-making, especially the provision on the difference in gold price fluctuations, which is more to the point.

As for the rise in commodity prices, of course, slowing down the trend of skyrocketing gold prices can slow down the rate of rise. However, it will never fall back just because the gold price stops skyrocketing. Moreover, the rise and fall of gold prices is the object of profit for a few speculators, while the rise and fall of commodity prices affects ordinary citizens widely. Therefore, although the main reason for this rise in commodity prices is the rise in gold prices, curbing the skyrocketing of gold prices is only one way to curb commodity prices, not a fundamental solution to flatten commodity prices.

If the skyrocketing of gold prices and the prices of daily necessities can be isolated by adopting economic policies, we naturally agree. However, if there is only the power to stimulate the rise in gold prices and no guarantee to prevent general commodity prices from being affected by gold prices, and there is no guarantee to isolate the link between gold prices and commodity prices, then the so-called "trying to draw a tiger but ending up with something resembling a dog," this kind of measure related to people's livelihood must not be experimental in nature.

In short, economic policy is not one-sided, it must be comprehensive. The policies on gold prices and general commodity prices should not only implement comprehensive control on price policies, but also coordinate with this in monetary policy to be effective for the entire people's livelihood issue. We hope that the Chinese and Japanese authorities will jointly pay attention to the implementation of wartime economic policies and must take into account the coordination of the national economy and cannot ignore the importance of the national economy.

### Principles for Dealing with the Gold Problem

The price of gold is becoming increasingly expensive, almost without end. At the same time, the soaring gold price is inducing a general rise in commodity prices. From the standpoint of a wartime economy, this phenomenon cannot be ignored. Observing the commodity prices of the past ten days or so, when the gold price rose the most, it can be seen that in addition to rice, the gold price has dragged up other commodity prices, and at the same time, other commodity prices have also followed the gold price. Therefore, if this is left unattended in the future, solving the problem of commodity prices will become even more difficult. The reason for the soaring gold price is speculative activity. This is a fact that everyone has witnessed. Who is engaging in what kind of speculation? This question can be clearly understood from the facts disclosed in the gold market. Therefore, if the authorities are determined to suppress speculation in order to curb the gold price, it is very simple. However, we do not have high expectations for a policy that only uses suppression. The suppression of speculation may cause illicit transactions to shift to the black market. If the cause of speculation is not eliminated and a black market is forced into existence, it will be more difficult to control gold price fluctuations, and the adverse economic effects will be even greater. Although improper speculation should certainly be suppressed, it seems necessary to consider suppressing general transactions. Of course, the target of suppression should be speculative phenomena, but it is not easy to distinguish between speculation and legitimate transactions. If normal transactions are also suppressed, then the fundamental concept of selling gold vouchers is completely denied.

So, if we do not adopt a policy of strongly suppressing speculation, what kind of strategies can be used to curb speculative phenomena? Although there is more than one or two such methods, we strongly advocate the following three fundamental countermeasures: Strictly supervise the issuance of promissory notes, and if factually possible, realize the standardization of special promissory notes. Strictly inspect financial institutions and severely punish the release of speculative funds. Restrict gold bar transactions and stipulate the daily fluctuation margin. When this margin is exceeded, issue an order to suspend transactions. If the above conditions can be correctly implemented, speculative phenomena will naturally be curbed. The reason why speculation is rampant is due to the release of speculative funds. At the current stage, these funds cannot be obtained from anywhere other than financial institutions. Furthermore, even financial institutions cannot unlimitedly possess a large amount of funds. The problem lies in giving financial institutions an easy means of creating credit. Therefore, the issuance of promissory notes is self-evident. As for setting a margin limit for transactions and suspending transactions when this margin is exceeded, this is a method used by the stock exchange and can also be applied to gold bar transactions. If the various measures mentioned above can be implemented comprehensively, then gold bar speculation can be suppressed to a considerable extent.

Finally, we hope to crack down on speculation, and we do not want to lag behind others, but we must guard against the possibility that forced crackdowns will cause gold bar transactions to turn into a black market. At the same time, during crackdowns, there is often a regrettable phenomenon of only catching small fish while letting the big fish get away. Although it is also important to pay attention to the fact that most of those who appear on the surface of speculation are small fish, catching the big fish can be done by simply investigating the truth of the few financial capitalists who currently own the most gold bars. However, in view of various circumstances, it is hoped that this action will be carried out with great caution. Therefore, the possible implementation and efficient methods are the above three principles. We sincerely hope that the Chinese and Japanese authorities can start from the above perspectives and actively deal with the entire problem (Translated from the "Continental News," July 25).

### All Sectors in Suzhou Raise Donations to Relieve Disaster-Stricken Citizens in Shanghai

Suzhou, July 25 (Central News Agency) - Enemy planes blindly bombed the Shanghai area, killing and injuring innocent civilians. This inhumane act is deeply dissatisfying here. Ren Xiping, General Manager of the Jiangsu Provincial Bank, and several leaders of the local financial and industrial sectors, have now launched a campaign to raise donations from the citizens of this city. They have already raised more than 50 million yuan and will send it to the Shanghai Citizens' Welfare Association within the next few days to express their relief for the citizens who have suffered from the air raids.

### Air Defense Drills Held in Suzhou Provincial Capital

Suzhou, July 25 (Central News Agency) - The Suzhou Provincial Air Defense Command, considering that the war is becoming increasingly fierce and that rear cities are at risk of air raids at any time, has specifically scheduled air defense exercises for the evenings of the 24th and 26th of this month to arouse public awareness of air defense and strictly implement lighting control.

### Location for the Trial of German and Italian War Criminals

Decided to be in Nuremberg

July 15 (Central News Agency) - According to news from London: Since the Three-Power Conference, Germany is now doing a second job of maintaining security, as war criminals from Germany and Italy may be tried in a certain area of Germany. According to the New York Times published in London, the United States, Britain, the Soviet Union, and France have drafted regulations on the trial procedures for war criminals a few days ago. All representatives unanimously agreed that the trial should be held in Germany, and Nuremberg has actually been designated as the location for the trial. If the trial is indeed held in Nuremberg, then in other words, it will be held within the jurisdiction of the U.S. Third Military District. Therefore, senior U.S. military commanders have asked Yorkson and others to provide proper methods for maintaining security to prevent Nazi elements and anti-Nazi elements from taking the opportunity to cause trouble.

### Mussolini's Eldest Son Detained in Concentration Camp

Hundred Lun, July 25 (Central News Agency) - According to a Swiss telegram citing news from the Swiss-Italian border: Vittorio Mussolini, the eldest son of former Italian Prime Minister Mussolini, surrendered to the Allied forces a few days ago and is currently being held in a certain concentration camp.

### The Three-Power Conference and the East Asian Situation - The United States Eagerly Seeks a Solution to the War Against Japan

Tokyo, July 25 (Central News Agency) - Since President Truman took office, the United States has changed Roosevelt's dictatorial tendencies, maintained close ties with Congress, and replaced key government officials, demonstrating unexpected political skill. Therefore, domestically, his steady hand is even better than that of the late President Roosevelt. What is even more noteworthy is that although the United States has been at war for four years, the domestic situation is generally stable, and the people are proudly confident of victory in the future. However, regarding the war against Japan, all parties have recently hoped for an early end. Truman and other government officials also hold this urgent hope, which has gradually formed a kind of anxiety. The clouds of war in the world have come to an end with the surrender of Germany, and Europe has entered the stage of post-war cleaning. However, in East Asia, a deadly battle is still being fought with Japan, forcing the United States to continue bleeding, which is a major obstacle to the post-war world policy that the United States is concerned about day and night. Therefore, from the perspective of the United States, in order to catch up with the post-war policies of the Soviet Union and other European countries and not fall behind, and to seize the reins of world politics with the current favorable position, it is an urgent task to quickly end the war against Japan. Looking at the recent foreign telegrams, it is not difficult for us to discover the United States' peace offensive against Japan. However, this is a vicious American-style means with strategic intentions. The United States insists on unconditional surrender, and it is very obvious that it will launch a large-scale aggression in East Asia in both political and military operations. It is reported that the Three-Power Conference held in Potsdam, a suburb of Berlin, raised the discussion of the East Asian issue in the first meeting. Another trend related to East Asian political issues is the six Stalin-Song Ziwen talks, which were temporarily suspended due to the holding of the Three-Power Conference. What is noteworthy is that on the eve of Song Ziwen's visit to the Soviet Union, he extensively sought the United States' views on the East Asian issue. Although the Stalin-Song Ziwen talks were formally a meeting between the Soviet Union and Chongqing, they were actually a preparatory meeting between the United States and the Soviet Union on the East Asian issue. Song Ziwen can be called the spokesperson for the United States. Therefore, although the talks were held six times, the official announcement still stated that no resolution had been reached. From this judgment, it can be known that negotiations on the East Asian issue between Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union are difficult to resolve simply. However, regardless of whether the Three-Power Conference has reached any kind of understanding, from Japan's perspective, it cannot but be concerned about the discussion of the East Asian issue by the three countries. In short, the United States' recent political and military offensives against Japan are extremely active. However, this may also be a strategy of the United States, and it is an expression of the enemy's negligence. According to people here, Japan's only way out in the future is to destroy the United States' offensive and advance the belief in completing the war.

### Japanese Diplomacy Deserves Special Attention

Tokyo, July 25 (Central News Agency) - The "Tokyo Shimbun" published an article on the 25th entitled "One Factor of Japanese Diplomacy That Deserves Special Attention," stating that the main figure in the Three-Power Conference is Stalin, and this point should be noted. The Soviet Union's prominent international position has now been noted by the world. After the end of the European war, those who went to visit the Kremlin came one after another. Stalin's position in today's world politics is no less than that of Wilson in the middle of the last European war. After the end of the European war, the common goal of the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union to defeat Germany was achieved. The Soviet Union is no longer an ally moving towards a common goal, but is regarded as an ally that adjusts and resolves interests. The Soviet Union has now been freed from the burden of war and can freely exert its skills. On the contrary, the United States and Britain still have the difficult task of the war against Japan, so they have to make concessions to the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union's position in the Three-Power Conference is as described above. Therefore, the world in the future will be determined by Stalin's heart. This matter should be the most important factor for Japanese diplomacy today.

### The Inside Story of the China Problem is Complicated

Lisbon, July 25 (Central News Agency) - With regard to the Three-Power Conference, the fact that the East Asian issue is also on the agenda is frequently transmitted by telegrams from the United States and Britain, but the content of this news seems to be conjecture. The theme of each report is related to the Soviet Union's policy toward China prepared by the Stalin-Song Ziwen talks, as well as the East Asian policies of Britain and the United States that are related to the Pacific war situation. However, how the complex political disputes within China and the mutual interests of the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union will be adjusted does not seem to have been resolved. The main points of view are cited as follows: Lippmann of the United States, in the Herald Tribune, criticized the Yan'an forces that exist outside the Chongqing control circle, stating that to solve the China problem, it is extremely difficult to proceed without a clear understanding between the Soviet Union and China, or without recognition from the United States. Even in the form of a federal country, whether China can be unified is at risk of expanding from Outer Mongolia to the Yellow River. The United States and Britain hope to achieve the effect of preventing the southward movement of red forces in Song Ziwen's work in Moscow and have reported that the Song-Shi talks have established a certain foundation for an agreement. Lippmann also discussed this issue, assuming that an agreement has indeed been reached between Song and Shi, but questioned what kind of power Song Ziwen and the Chongqing regime have over the vast territory of China, and whether the United States has the ability to implement a general agreement. The diplomatic reporter of the "Daily Telegraph" remained silent on the East Asian issue of the Three-Power Conference. The newspaper only stated that the Three-Power Conference will discuss the issue of the Soviet Union's active participation in the current war situation.

### Churchill Returns Home - Potsdam Conference Adjourns - Results of British General Election to be Announced Today

Stockholm, Sweden, July 25 (Central News Agency) - According to a Reuters telegram from Potsdam: After the meeting on the 24th, the Three-Power Conference immediately entered a state of adjournment, because British Prime Minister Churchill, accompanied by Foreign Secretary Eden and Attlee, returned to London on the 25th. After inspecting the results of the British general election on the 26th, they will return to Potsdam on the 27th. During this recess, the secretariat of the Three-Power Conference will prepare the agenda or prepare the report for the conclusion of the talks in order to cope with the resumption of the meeting.

Stockholm, Sweden, July 25 (Central News Agency) - According to a Reuters reporter: The news of who will be the next Prime Minister of Britain, Churchill or Attlee, will not be revealed until 4 pm on Thursday. Yesterday, the three heads of state in Potsdam held the last meeting, as the leaders of Britain will all return to London today. Political circles in London firmly believe that regardless of whether the Conservative Party or the Labour Party wins the election, Churchill and Attlee will still go to Berlin to continue the talks.

### American Aircraft Production

Tokyo, July 25 (Central News Agency) - The enemy's aircraft production plan, formulated by the United States to deal with the Greater East Asia War, focuses on manufacturing B29 aircraft, which goes without saying. However, recently this policy has been changed to adopt a policy that emphasizes medium-sized bombers and fighter planes, which is noteworthy.

### Continued Report on Petain's Trial - Testimony of Former French Prime Minister Reynaud

Hundred Lun, July 25 (Central News Agency) - According to news received here: Marshal Petain was retried yesterday under the charge of "harming the country and colluding with the enemy." The Paris District Court was filled with an atmosphere like a parliamentary debate. Reynaud, the former Prime Minister of France when Germany invaded Paris, stated in his confession of how France was defeated that he fundamentally believed in General Petain's patriotism in 1940, which was a fundamental mistake. The interest of the spectators in the court waned because Petain refused to answer various questions on Monday. However, there were still 1,000 armed military police stationed in front of the District Court.

At the beginning of the trial, Reynaud continued his testimony, which was interrupted the previous day, stating, "When General Petain was promoted to be the head of France, he issued a commission appointing the key members of the various departments. The name of Laval was not yet seen among them, although Laval was very close to Petain at the time. As for the armistice agreement, I did not learn about it until June 23. I recall that Admiral Darlan once stated that he would do his best to keep French ships in all ports out of enemy hands. However, British Prime Minister Churchill did not trust Admiral Darlan's words and eventually sank all the French ships in Alan Port. This was the beginning of the suffering of me and Mantell (Mantell was the Interior Minister when Reynaud formed the cabinet and was later assassinated in Paris in June 1944). We were all accused of 'misappropriating public funds,' but they failed to prove our guilt and were imprisoned until June 23. Admiral Darlan (Darlan was the commander-in-chief of the French Navy when France was at war with Germany. Later, when Bei Chang signed an armistice agreement with Germany, he served as the Minister of the Navy) enthusiastically declared, 'If France surrenders, I will personally go to the sea and issue an order that French ships will never fall into enemy hands.' I believe Lei Yi will certainly not break his promise." At that time, Petain strongly opposed increasing the construction of defense projects on the northern border of Tai Country. This violated the war strategy of Generals Foch and Weigang in the past. Petain, as the Minister of War, only did some insignificant trivial matters in northern France and strongly opposed the "two-year military service system." In mid-February 1940, he claimed, "In less than five months, you will all be defeated, and France will establish a dictatorship." On May 30, 1940, he claimed again, "In the second week of May, the entire French people will need me very much." During Reynaud's testimony, Marshal Petain sat quietly in his chair, standing up, lightly patting the armrests of the chair, for about three hours. The atmosphere in the court was extremely quiet, in stark contrast to the interrogation on Tuesday. Reynaud's every word was very clear. The interrogation was resumed after a 40-minute break. Reynaud also testified, "Petain's first crime was to subvert the French Republic. France's defeat was entirely because the congressional authorities were deceived by Petain, so no one was more harmful to the French people than Petain." After a slight pause, Reynaud continued to testify how the government moved to Tours when Germany invaded France, and how Baodoux and Bei Chang secretly hid the telegram from Britain to France requesting that French ships be transferred to British military ports without announcing it to Congress. Finally, Reynaud concluded, "Amid the German praise, Petain embarked on the road of ruining his reputation." The interrogation was suspended again at 6:45 pm.

### Issuance of Residence Permits in Zhabei and Other Districts to Begin Next Month - Baojia Office Convened Representatives from Various Districts Yesterday for Talks

Since the issuance of residence permits began for residents in the urban area, the time has been nearly one month. Under the jurisdiction of the city police bureau, most of it has been completed. The authorities of the Baojia offices of Zhabei, Penglai, Yi, Xu Jia, and Dongchang six districts, which have newly entered the urban area, have also made secret plans and decided to start issuing residence permits from August 1. Yesterday (25th) at 4 pm, the general liaisons and the directors of the fourth sections of the police sub-bureaus of the six districts were summoned to a talk meeting at the seventh police bureau. Director Gu of the Baojia Office presided over the meeting in person, and Deputy Director Da Chuan, Deputy Directors Gang and Chen Jiufeng of the North and South District Offices, Section Chief Manjima of the Fourth Department, and the chief representative of the General Affairs Office attended the meeting. First, the director explained in detail all the procedures for issuing residence permits, and earnestly instructed that the principle of convenience for the people should be followed, strictly prohibiting deliberate obstruction, and providing detailed guidance to citizens. Then, Section Chief Manjima delivered a speech, expressing deep expectations. After that, a simple procedure was discussed to improve the method, and several points of attention for issuing residence permits were revised until the end at 6 pm.

### Silver and Money Industries Advance the Time for Check Clearing

The check clearing time for the silver and money industries in this city was changed to 12 noon for the first clearing, starting from June 18, when the business hours were revised. The second clearing is at 4 pm. Now that the inter-industry check next-day clearing system is implemented on the 30th of this month, the check clearing time is wider, so it has been changed to 9 am every day. For those who are designated by each bank to go to the check clearing house and the industry market every day, penalties will be imposed for each error in the credit of the clearing difference calculation form or the first announcement, or for being late or absent for less than 10 minutes and already over 10 minutes, each error in the second report of the clearing difference calculation form, and errors in the turnaround application. This is because the business of the silver and money industries is very large, and we are trying to urge the industry to strictly abide by the regulations. As for the check clearing time for foreign banks' check clearing houses, it has not been revised at present. The checks cleared by the silver and money industries will still follow the time of 11 am every day, which has been in effect since July 3. Each bank will follow the Silver Union regulations at 10:30 am every day, and the treasury regulations will follow the treasury time before 2 pm every afternoon.

### Half-Year Settlement Surplus

The half-year settlements of the various banks and money shops in this city have all yielded surpluses this year, and their business is more prosperous than in the second half of last year. However, most of the stable banks and money shops are mediocre. According to talks in the industry: This situation is not a bright path for the financial industry. During the period of unsmooth material exchange, the industry and commerce are quite affected. In addition, commodity prices are irrationally soaring and rising sharply, and people's purchasing power is shrinking day by day. Industry and commerce are affected by these two factors, resulting in a decline in business dealings with the silver and money industries. Therefore, in addition to the legitimate business dealings with industry and commerce, in order to maintain business, the silver and money industries have to abandon the fundamental and pursue the superficial, and engage in speculative lending and other pawn lending, discounting, or hoarding.

### Application Form for Transfer Lease License

The transfer lease licenses for houses in the old one and eight districts of this city have expired for the first half of the year. The Finance Bureau of this city has stipulated that the application forms for the licenses for the second half of the year will be issued from yesterday (25th), notifying the second landlords in the two districts to go to the bureau to collect them. The form of the application form is the same as before, including the applicant's name, nationality, address, date of commencement of subletting, number of subletters, amount of quarterly housing donation, application date, etc., and must be submitted together with the summer housing donation ticket and the license fee to be paid to the License Office of the Bureau at 200 Fuzhou Road before September 7 of this year to verify and issue new licenses.

### Transportation Agency Plans to Establish a Branch in the Post Office

The East Asia Transportation Corporation's Baxianqiao Branch, in order to facilitate the purchase of China Railway tickets by citizens in the southern district, in addition to selling passenger tickets in the Hua Zhong area at the original branch, will also sell passenger tickets and luggage tickets in the Hua Bei area at the Baxianqiao Post Office next door from today. In addition, the East Asia Transportation Corporation's head office plans to establish branches in the post offices in various districts of this city in order to facilitate citizens' evacuation and return to their hometowns, and is currently preparing for it.

### Regulations for the Appointment and Dismissal of Principals and Teachers of Primary and Secondary Schools

The regulations for the appointment and dismissal of principals and teachers of primary and secondary schools in this city have not been revised since the incident, making it difficult to standardize the procedures for such appointments and dismissals. In particular, regarding the foreign schools and public primary and secondary schools in the former First and Eighth Districts, after the Education Bureau took over and converted them into municipal schools, these schools either followed past practices or were unclear about current laws and regulations, inevitably leading to many differences in the appointment and dismissal of principals and teachers. Recently, the Education Bureau, in order to enhance administrative efficiency and unify official decrees, has drafted four temporary regulations for the appointment and dismissal of "Municipal Primary School Teachers," "Municipal Secondary School Teachers," "Primary School Principals," and "Secondary School Principals," which have been submitted to the Municipal Government for approval and will be implemented from the date of the order. These four regulations must be followed not only by municipal and county schools but also by private primary and secondary schools.

### Barber Prices Double, Authorities Should Suppress Them

Recently, barbers in this city have increased their prices without the approval of the authorities, with increases reaching more than double. It is hoped that the authorities responsible for price management will investigate and take measures to reduce prices, thereby alleviating the burden on citizens.

### Gold Certificate Market Quiet

The gold certificate market remained quiet after opening yesterday, with investors also hesitant. As a result, prices fell by 1.08 million yuan compared to the previous day, with very few transactions. Matured bonds opened at 10.7 million yuan and closed at 10.7 million yuan, a decrease of 1.08 million yuan compared to the previous day, with a transaction volume of 5.

The first was a match between the women's all-star team and the women's champion team, the Three Provinces Team.

Immediately afterward, a wonderful match between Zhongbei and the men's all-star team began. The men's all-star team took the first two games, but Zhongbei counterattacked and won back one game. Due to the lateness of the hour in the fourth game, it was not completed and dispersed.

### Accumulating Virtue is Better Than Accumulating Wealth; Serving the Public is Better Than Serving Oneself

The Nouveau Riche and the Idea of Helping Students

Recently, Shanghai has been subjected to repeated bombings, resulting in numerous deaths and injuries. As a result, the psychology of the general public has changed, and their view of life has also been transformed. For example, those who were usually violent have become gentle; those who behaved poorly have turned from evil to good; and those who were always stingy have become generous and magnanimous. Yesterday, I met a victor in the pursuit of wartime profiteering—a nouveau riche. In the past five or six years, he speculated and hoarded goods, earning exorbitant profits of hundreds of thousands, or even millions. He usually valued private interests and forgot about public welfare, knowing only himself and not others, and was indifferent to social causes, just like the ways of the Jews. Recently, with the frequent bombings, he experienced them firsthand, suffering greatly from shock and fear. He said to me personally, "Shanghai was originally a comfortable home, but suddenly the wind and clouds have changed color, and clear skies have brought disasters, scaring the citizens out of their wits. If this continues, human lives will not even be worth as much as grass. What use are fame and wealth? What guarantee is there for life and property? Let's just say that accumulating virtue is better than accumulating wealth, and serving the public is better than serving oneself. The newspapers are appealing for donations to rescue victims and help students. I plan to donate a lot, not for the sake of my descendants, but just to eliminate disasters for myself." His words were filled with emotion!

The reason I have written down his words is to persuade everyone to see through the view of life, to thoroughly correct the past style of being selfish and forgetting the public, and of not pulling out a single hair to benefit others, and to use this as a "one-to-three" analogy to advise the general rich people to think the same way. If so, the fund for helping students in need will not be difficult to reach the expected goal, and there will be hope for a steady increase in donation records.

### Land Sold at Low Price to Donate to Student Aid Fund

Dr. Tang Jiefu, the manufacturer of Kanghuo Stomach Powder, in order to help students who have dropped out of school, is willing to sell a plot of land, located at No. 3730 Huangzi, Luofahua District, measuring 1.96 mu, with two land certificates, at a reduced price, with half of the proceeds going to the Shenxin Two Newspapers Student Aid Fund. There is no shortage of wealthy individuals in Shanghai. Those who wish to purchase it should contact the Social Service Department of this newspaper.

### Ninth Session of the Readers' Student Aid Fund Special Fundraising Team

The Ordinary Team, Team 73, led by Tang Cheng Wude, raised 200,000 yuan; Team 74, led by Qin Benru, raised 100,000 yuan; Team 75, led by Wu Yu Ji, raised 100,000 yuan; Team 76, led by Wang Mingsan, raised 100,000 yuan; Team 77, the Xinda Qianzhuang Team, raised 100,000 yuan. The total raised by the teams above was 600,000 yuan, bringing the total collected to 15,435,500 yuan.

(Note) We are grateful to Mr. Han Zhicheng for organizing the Honorary Team and generously donating 1 million yuan. We extend our gratitude to Tang Chengde, Qin Benru, Wu Xingji, Wang Mingzhi, and the Xinda Qianzhuang for their donations. The Xinda Qianzhuang's response to the student aid movement, following the lead of the Juyu Qianzhuang, is deeply gratifying to us! We hope that the hundreds of bank branches in Shanghai will respond in kind, each organizing a team and donating generously, so that the student aid fund will have a bright future and thousands of poor students will have hope and be eternally grateful.

Yesterday, we received student aid donations from Ying Baige, Mr. Li, and Zong Zongyu, each donating 50,000 yuan. An anonymous donor (receipt number 9031) donated 20,000 yuan. Lu Yiyi, Lu Yiqing, and Lu Zhongliang jointly donated 20,000 yuan. Li Zhongyong donated 15,000 yuan. Shen Zhenglong, Ms. Yuan Chenruxiang, and Xu Pingyang each donated 10,000 yuan. Zi Zisheng donated 5,000 yuan. Mrs. Pu Qiting donated 1,000 yuan. The total received yesterday was 241,000 yuan.

### Uphold the Spirit of Human Mutual Aid, Rescue Compatriots from Unforeseen Disaster

Mr. Wu Peizhi wrote in a letter: "I am an apprentice in a store. Although I am young and have little strength, I am very concerned about social welfare. Therefore, I donate to any public welfare cause with all my efforts, believing that what I get from society should be repaid to the people, which is a joy in life. This time, Shanghai has suffered a tragic bombing, and compatriots have died unjustly and become displaced and homeless. It is unbearable to witness. Therefore, rescuing compatriots from unforeseen disasters is our bounden duty. Upholding the spirit of human mutual aid, we cannot sit idly by. My heart has been stirred. I have gathered 60,000 yuan from my savings and have done my best to raise funds from colleagues and friends, raising a total of 3.5 million yuan (the list is attached in a separate report), which will be used as a bombing relief fund. I believe that if we work together to rescue our compatriots, it will be easy to do. However, because my personal strength is limited, I cannot solicit donations from door to door. I hope that enthusiastic people in Shanghai will rise up in response, and that colleagues in major businesses will respond enthusiastically and do their best, so that the displaced can return to their homes, the dead can rest in peace, and those with broken arms and legs can be treated. This merit and virtue are immeasurable."

### Anonymous Donor Donates Free Hospital Beds

Shanghai has been subjected to air raids for several consecutive days, and dozens of injured people have been sent to the Siming Hospital for treatment. The hospital is doing its best to treat them, but it is suffering from a lack of funds. Even gauze bandages for treating injuries are in short supply, relying on donations from all sectors of society. Yesterday, an anonymous donor generously donated ten free hospital beds for treating injuries, and all expenses will be covered by the donor. Their enthusiasm for public welfare is commendable. Anyone in need of these free beds can contact the hospital directly.

### Xiangsheng Tricycles Voluntarily Transport Injured Civilians

Recently, this city was attacked by enemy aircraft, and many innocent civilians were killed and injured. Zhou Xiangsheng, Deputy Chief of the Joint Defense of the Lu Jiazui District, witnessed the injured civilians after the air raids. Because of the lack of vehicles at the rescue stations and hospitals, there were delays, resulting in loss of life. Therefore, he voluntarily provided the Xiangsheng tricycle passenger cars he operates for free transportation, without charging a penny. In the future, if the self-defense personnel of the Baojia in each district discover citizens injured by bombing or shrapnel during air raids, they can immediately call the tricycle company for free transportation. If there are dispatch vehicles of the company along the road, they can also provide transportation. The Baojia Office and the Police Department will commend Zhou, Deputy Chief of the Joint Defense, for his courage and willingness to act, and hope that tricycle companies in all districts will follow suit.

### Self-Reliance

— Xia E

Picking up his younger brother's report card, he couldn't help but frown at the row of scores in the eighties and nineties.

"Brother, do you think my grades are good enough to get the Shuping Scholarship?" Joy shone on his brother's thin, small face.

His brother's question reminded him of the promise he made half a year ago: "As long as you study hard and get the Shuping Scholarship, I will definitely find a way to continue your schooling."

He didn't answer his brother. His eyes were a little blurred, and he seemed to feel that this report card was intertwined with his own experiences in high school.

He also had such good grades back then, and was also publicly praised as a good student at school. His father also promised that as long as his grades were excellent, he would definitely be able to go to university. But what was the result? After his father's departure and loss of support, he had no choice but to jump out and shoulder the burdens of life without graduating from high school.

"What's the use of studying so well!" he suddenly said angrily, throwing his brother's report card on the ground.

His brother's joyful face turned pale. He hurriedly picked up the report card that he had received from the principal in front of over a thousand classmates, as if feeling a kind of humiliated anger: "Why did you throw it on the ground? Are you angry that my grades are better than yours?"

Sitting next to him, his mother looked at him in surprise and coaxed his younger brother, "Don't argue with your brother. His grades weren't any worse than yours when he was studying."

After a while, she complained to him, "You shouldn't treat your brother like that. As an older brother, you should praise him for doing well in school."

A wave of awkward self-reproach swept through his heart. He knew that destroying a child's self-esteem and suppressing their ambition was a mistake. He knew that the words "studying is useless" had never been imprinted on his brother's pure heart, and that he must think that studying was the most important thing. He buries himself in his studies every day and doesn't play. Coupled with malnutrition, he looks much more haggard and weaker than other children. Why is that? Isn't it because a naive child's heart has been stained with the sorrows of life, understanding that if he doesn't study hard, he won't have the hope of going back to school and won't be able to satisfy his desire for knowledge?

-- My brother is innocent. I shouldn't transfer the pain I experienced to him. -- He said to himself deeply. He looked at his brother with loving eyes. His brother stood there in a daze, tears in his eyes.

"Mom, did you see what happened at another family's house? Someone got second place in the exam, and his dad was so happy that he bought him a lot of fish and meat to eat! But me... "his younger brother muttered with a pout. Realizing the injustice of the world, he was a little sad and angry.

At this moment, his father, who was sleeping in bed, turned over and groaned softly, as if he had heard their conversation.

He looked at his father's sallow face and said to his brother with a frown, "You need to understand that it's not just the tuition fee that's the problem now, it's the problem of eating! Even if you don't have to pay tuition to go to school, you still have to eat at home, and that won't work! Now is the time for you to find food for yourself!" He spoke each word tightly, and each sound hit his heart harder than it hit his brother's.

"Ask me to find food for myself?" A shadow fell over his brother's eyes. "Where can I go to find food? Even people as old as Dad can't do it, so how can it be my turn?"

"Yes, your dad... your dad has suffered from reading too many books!... "His father's voice was almost a powerless scream: "Reading made me an upright person. I have no property, but I won't cheat people out of their money, I won't make a fortune off the country's misfortune, and I won't flatter and toady... I only know how to use my strength and blood to earn money, to earn pitiful money!... Those black-hearted employers hired me at a very low price, squeezed out all my blood, and then abandoned me!... Child, I have been abandoned. Under such high life pressure, I can no longer afford to let you study or even eat!... Child, my blood is dry, but in order to survive, I still have to ask you to send your young bodies to another group of black-hearted employers to squeeze your blood!"

His father took a long breath. His weak heart was beating very fast from talking so much.

"What's wrong with you? Just rest and get some sleep. Why are you thinking so much?" His mother patted his father's back, her voice bewildered, "The children are grown up, and we won't suffer too much. Good days are coming."

The older brother put his hand on his younger brother's shoulder and said in a low voice, "Brother, listen to me. I went to see Uncle Huang yesterday, and he said that a friend of his owns a copper and tin shop and is looking for an apprentice. I immediately recommended you to him. He told me to call back in two days for an answer. We should be able to get it."

"You want me to be an apprentice?" His brother raised his head in panic, then lowered it again in despair. "I remember that you used to scold the bosses of those old-fashioned shops for oppressing their apprentices, making them suffer beatings and scoldings for five years. If they did something wrong, they would be told to get lost. You said that those bosses were demons who turned children into slaves and would be overthrown one day... But now you want me to go! I'm scared..."

"I said those things, and I have never forgotten them! But, brother, those were just powerless words! In fact, not only the bosses of old-fashioned shops, but also the bosses in the so-called modern companies where I work, also use very cruel means to make us their slaves who dare not resist! Brother, think about it, aren't those words all the same?"

His mother listened to her son's words, and a glimmer of hope flowed through her cold heart that had been deprived of warmth for so long, as if a position had been secured. She no longer thought about the boss's fierce eyes and crooked face. She only hallucinated that her clever little son had entered the door of business and prosperity. Before he was poisoned by the empty talk in books, he had grasped the method of making money and seeking profit, and would soon become a capable businessman, like many people nowadays, cleverly taking a lot of wealth by crooked means.

-- Yes, a money-grubber is not a good name, but at least it's better than the two words "pure and aloof," which are enough to make people starve to death! -- She had no choice but to think like this.

The brother listened quietly, thought quietly, and suddenly picked up the report card and tore it to shreds.

"Hey, what's that?" His mother picked up the shredded report card with regret. "Even though you're going to be an apprentice now, it's only temporary. You can still go to school later, right? This report card is proof that you can go to school later. Why did you tear it up?"

"Mom, I don't want to study anymore. Poor people can't turn their lives around even if they study..."

The older brother stood there in a daze. He wanted to tell his younger brother that poor people should also study, but what they study is not just textbooks, but also a living life and a living book. Only by reading a living book can you know how to live and transform - for yourself and for the masses! But he didn't tell his brother this. He knew that in the future, his brother would understand more clearly than him, and perhaps his belief in transformation would be even stronger!

"Brother, you can be self-reliant. You are more useful than your classmates!" It took him a long time to utter these words.

"I can be self-reliant. I know." His brother flashed a firm gaze. "The teacher said that suffering can forge useful people. Brother, isn't that right? What does suffering matter to us?"

### Birthday

— Lu Wen

I went to a relative's house to celebrate a birthday.

As soon as I entered the door, I smelled something strange in the air. Not to mention anything else, it didn't look like someone was having a birthday at all. There were no candles, longevity incense, or anything like that. Apart from me, there were no other guests.

"Congratulations, congratulations." I said to the host, cupping my hands and bowing.

"Please sit down," the host said indifferently.

The birthday celebrant was just like he usually was, and hadn't changed in the slightest because it was his birthday. He was angry, talking to his two daughters.

"Tuition!... All day long, it's just these fees, tuition fees, gymnastics fees..."

"Physical education fee," the younger daughter corrected him quietly.

"I know..." the birthday celebrant shouted loudly, turning his face to me and saying, "These schools nowadays, what are they? They haven't taught much, but they're asking for money all day long, one fee after another, one donation after another..."

"Yes, yes." I said, accompanying him.

I knew this elder's temperament. He would say whatever he thought, without worrying about offending others. Just like this time, he clearly knew that I was also a teacher and should also be in the category of "what are they." But I knew that he didn't mean to accuse all the monks of being bald.

"Now," he continued to testify, "now there's another retention fee, saying that if you don't pay it by the deadline, you'll be fined a thousand yuan for every day that it's late... Is this a school?!"

"Learning to paint is really expensive nowadays," I said, answering a question with another question, intending to ease the atmosphere.

"That's right, they say it's four dou of rice. According to today's market price, it's almost 400,000 yuan. Two of them would be 800,000 yuan. It's no joke!"

"Actually, the number is scary, but it's just eight dou of rice," his wife, a distant aunt of mine, said, seemingly seasoned in worldly affairs.

"But, hey! Her eyes aren't small." The gentleman's fire turned to his wife: "But I earned them one by one, not grabbed them in handfuls. You don't care about anything at home, just enjoy what's already there..."

"What do you mean, just enjoy what's already there! Who's busy with the firewood and rice?" The wife seemed to be getting angry too.

"Tuition fees are outrageous!" I said, trying to ease the atmosphere.

"That's why!" Finally, the gentleman's anger calmed down: "In this day and age, I really don't know what the use of studying is. To be honest with you, if I weren't in this position, if I weren't working at a bank, I would really want to send these two children to work in a factory..."

I smiled at him. "You're joking!"

The host continued very seriously:

"It's true. I'm not joking. Nowadays, you can get three or four dou of rice for working in some places. Three or four dou of rice is now 300,000 to 400,000 yuan! I only get 160,000 to 170,000 yuan now. And I have to support such a big family. That's why I said, I really want to do that!"

He faced his wife: "Speaking of which, someone's daughter is working in a factory." His wife didn't know if she disagreed at all, or if she was just joking for her husband's birthday, to add a little joy to the atmosphere. Otherwise, she just unintentionally said this.

But the birthday celebrant got angry.

"Face? In this day and age, who cares about face? Not starving to death is a good thing!"

Saying this, he threw a folding fan he was shaking heavily on the table. "Clang!"

"Can't you say something auspicious for your birthday?" his wife said in a low voice. "And there are guests here."

"You're being too polite," I said with a dry laugh. "What kind of guest am I?"

"What does it matter if there are guests?" the birthday celebrant still had that attitude. "We're family. Why be so polite? To be honest, old nephew, you know my temper. I really don't like pretending to be rich, but your aunt really likes that. She's always talking about face. It makes us look strong on the outside but weak on the inside."

"This is human interaction. It's not about showing off or not," his wife protested.

I felt a heat on my face, and sweat broke out. I was at a loss, not knowing how to break the deadlock. I really didn't expect to encounter such a birthday scene when I came to celebrate.

At this moment, my uncle didn't get angry or complain. He just sighed.

"Human interaction. If I had gotten used to it earlier, I wouldn't still be in this position today. In the past ten years, how many people have soared to success..."

"Don't say such depressing things, okay? Weishan is young. Why are you saying these things to him?" The hostess interrupted him. "Let's eat."

"Alright. But there's nothing depressing about it. It's the truth." He finally stopped talking. "Is there any wine? Weishan, have a drink with me. I haven't had a drink in a long time."

While eating, the birthday celebrant kept nagging. Actually, it was wrong to say nagging. Who could hate the groans of a person squeezed by the heavy burdens of life?

My aunt had prepared a few dishes. Maybe it was because I was there, so she couldn't explode. I only saw my uncle frown when he glanced at the table and found a few meat dishes.

I didn't know what to say. My uncle kept flipping a bowl of vegetarian dishes with his chopsticks, as if looking for something, and occasionally impatiently chased away the flies that landed on the table. The two cousins were probably depressed about the retention fee, and only focused on eating with their heads down.

The lights weren't on yet, and the house was dark.

My aunt wanted to break the awkward atmosphere, and tried her best to smile naturally:

"I'm really being neglectful. It's rare for Weishan to come to our house for dinner, and he even came to celebrate your birthday. We didn't even prepare any good dishes."

"Don't say that, Aunt," I said, hearing my own forced laughter. "I should have come to celebrate your birthday."

"Actually, what's the point of a birthday?" my uncle said. "There's no need to rush around so much. As for some people who throw big banquets for their birthdays, that's even more unnecessary."

My uncle didn't smile once from beginning to end. To be honest, who would want to laugh? In this day and age, are there really so many funny things?

"Drink less wine," my aunt looked at my uncle and pointed at the dishes on the table. I knew she meant that if he drank any more, there wouldn't be any dishes left to eat later.

"I might as well not drink," my uncle put down his cup and said to me. "I originally wanted to use wine to relieve my worries, but I didn't expect that the more I drank, the more worried I became, ha."

He gave a bitter laugh. That was the first smile I saw on his birthday.

The lights weren't on yet.

### Don't Linger Any Longer

— Zhang Mengzhao

Shanghai is no longer a paradise for adventurers!

The terror of night and day is shaking your brain - life has no guarantee!

But perhaps you are briefly awake. After the roar, you are again dreaming of picking up gold! Stocks, real estate, hoarding, Western-style houses, cars, rickshaws, singing, dancing... How comfortable! How can you bear to give it up?

But, flesh and blood flying! The scene of a sandstorm catastrophe, doesn't it move you? Doesn't it frighten you?

Friends! Don't linger any longer! Shoulder your courage, and stride back to your hometown!

Shanghai is no longer a haven for adventurers!

### Goodbye, Shanghai

— Guang Bo

Tomorrow morning, we will be leaving Shanghai, where we have lived for over a decade and established some roots. The sole reason and purpose for our entire family's departure from Shanghai is, of course, to "evacuate." In fact, aside from a very small number of people who must stay in the city, every citizen needs to evacuate. However, most people have not yet made this decision. Are they unwilling to evacuate? In fact, everyone knows that their bodies are made of flesh and cannot withstand shrapnel; moreover, even if they sacrifice themselves, they won't get a title like "martyr" or anything. They are all a group of people who believe that "life is what I desire, but wealth is also what I desire."

For example, my older brother keeps yelling, "Evacuate, evacuate! What will happen to my business?" I said, "Business, business, a stone tower in the desert. I think no one dares to guarantee that all their wealth during this period can be safely transferred to the next period (the new era). You insist on building a business during the war, while I want to protect and develop my future."

My sister-in-law is just like the average young mistress nowadays, without ever having suffered, and without a correct new mindset. She said, "All my things (of course, referring to clothes...) can't be moved, and there are so many bad people in the countryside!" I said, "Being taken by bad people is more humane than being bombed." She said:

"How do you know for sure that we will be bombed?" I said, "Like winning the lottery with odds of tens of thousands, didn't you, sister-in-law, have great hopes of winning? But now there are dozens of bombs coming down. How do you know that none of them will hit us?" My second brother immediately said, "Isn't it too early to leave Shanghai right now?" I said, "Judging by the compatriots who sacrificed on the 17th, 18th, and 24th of this month, it's already too late. If we are bombed tonight and leave Shanghai tomorrow morning, it will still be too late."

My third brother, who recently got a girlfriend, is even more reluctant to leave Shanghai. He said, "If I die, I die. People are going to die once anyway." I said, "Like you and me, I haven't done anything for society or the country, so sacrificing ourselves like this would be letting down society and humanity!"

After a round of persuasion from me, our family finally unified our will. What I saw this time, although not universally applicable, can be summarized as follows: 1. People are weak and only want to maintain the status quo, and 2. The family bond is already like a pile of loose sand. At the same time, what I experienced regarding evacuation is that if one person in a family is enlightened and does something, he should strongly advocate it and will definitely be able to motivate the entire family to act. Because everyone wants their life, and is afraid of bombs.

Therefore, I hope that the enlightened people can firmly advocate it. If ten people are determined, perhaps ten families will evacuate. And I hope that starting tomorrow, you will also leave this Shanghai, where there is a possibility of being bombed, one family at a time.

Goodbye, Shanghai!
