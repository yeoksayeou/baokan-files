### National Army Encircles Jinzhou from Three Sides, Cutting Off Transportation to Huludao; Communist Troops in Changchun Disarmed by Soviet Army

[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper in Beiping, 24th] After crossing the Yuelian Mountains, the National Army continued to advance, launching a lightning attack on Jinzhou. Its vanguard troops have already surrounded Jinzhou. The speed of the 13th Army's armored forces' advance greatly exceeded the expectations of the Communists. The city is located between Shanhaiguan and Shenyang and serves as the second gateway for the National Army to enter the Northeast. The Communist Party has stationed heavy troops around it. Currently, the National Army is attacking the south, west, and north gates, and the transportation between Jinzhou and Huludao has been cut off. It is said that the Allied forces have cut off a small village five miles northeast of Jinzhou, thus isolating Huludao and diminishing its military importance.

[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper in Beiping, 24th] According to reliable sources, the Communist troops who entered Changchun were disarmed by the Soviet army on the 18th. Changchun is now under the guard of the Soviet army, and the city is more stable than before. This news was brought back by personnel who flew from Changchun to Beiping today and has been confirmed. According to them, on the third day after the personnel of the Northeast Headquarters successively returned to Beiping, the Soviet army surrounded and disarmed the police station taken over by the Communist troops. The director of the station, Zhang Qinghe, was also detained twice. Communist members were expelled from Changchun, while the rest were re-equipped with wooden sticks to assist the Soviet army in maintaining order. In recent days, the area in front of the Northeast Headquarters in Changchun and the Shanggao market have been guarded by increased Soviet troops, and Shanggao is more prosperous than before. Currently, the National Army is actively preparing to fly to Changchun at any time.

[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper in Tianjin, 24th] Qingdao, where the U.S. Marine Corps once landed, was suddenly attacked by Communist troops on Wednesday night in the northern suburbs. The Central 8th Army responded to the alarm and fought back. Seeing that the Central Army was prepared, the Communists retreated and fled.

[United Press Tianjin, 24th] In the first week of the National Army's entry into the Northeast, it has advanced 300 li beyond the Guanshan. The Communist troops are retreating steadily. Although small conflicts have occurred between the two sides, no fierce battles have yet taken place. Although the Communist troops have claimed that they will make their first resistance in Jinzhou, the National Army is advancing towards the area at a speed of 90 li per day and should arrive within five or six days. If Jinzhou can be captured in one fell swoop at that time, it will be possible to reach Shenyang in no more than three weeks. According to Chinese official sources, after the Soviet army disarmed and withdrew the Japanese army in various parts of the Northeast, the Japanese army's equipment was left piled up like mountains, which was taken by the local Communist troops at the opportunity to attack the National Army. Judging from the situation this week, the Communist troops are clearly abandoning Shandong and areas south of the Great Wall. The Communist troops may continue to prevent food from being transported to Beiping and Tianjin, and try to destroy railways as much as possible to delay the National Army's supply transportation, while also preventing factories in Shanghai, Qingdao, and Beiping from obtaining coal. It is learned that the Communist troops plan to temporarily adopt this destructive means in Guan Nei (areas south of the Great Wall) and move their main forces to the Northeast to resist the National Army. It would be possible to resolve the civil war with the KMT and the Communist Party forming a coalition government, but it seems impossible at present. It is rumored in some quarters that the Soviet Union will disregard the Sino-Soviet Treaty and propose to divide the Northeast into a buffer zone between Siberia and China. Although U.S. Army Commander in the China Theater, General Wedemeyer, and U.S. Secretary of State Byrnes have declared that the U.S. military will withdraw soon, the U.S. military in Beiping, Tianjin, Qingdao, and Qinhuangdao has not made any preparations to withdraw from North China. Of the 5,000 people who have been sent back to the country, there are still more than 50,000 stationed here, which is only about one-tenth in comparison.

[Central News Agency Tianjin, 24th] Communist troops continue to cause disturbances in the suburbs of Tianjin. Recently, they sent the pseudo-Jin Gu County Magistrate Ren Zhiyuan to lead more than 400 people into the Xiaozhan area in the southern suburbs of Tianjin to collect grain and money from the farmers. They also clashed with more than 200 members of the Tianjin County Security Team in Lubeikou, 40 li away from Tianjin. Both sides suffered casualties.

### Focus of Negotiations Between Us and the Soviet Side: Central Army Enters the Northeast, Eliminating All Possible Armed Resistance

[United Press International Chongqing, 24th] United Press International learned today from reliable sources that one of the focuses of discussion in the current Sino-Soviet negotiations is the disarmament by the Soviet Union of all Chinese miscellaneous troops in the nine eastern provinces, including the Communist troops rumored to be armed by the Soviet Union. The Chinese government insists that when the Central Army enters the nine eastern provinces, the Soviet side should reduce all possible armed resistance to a minimum. Other points of negotiation include: (1) The Soviet side should guarantee that important airfields such as Changchun, Shenyang, Harbin, and Qiqihar are available for the use of the Central Air Force. This shows that the Chinese government is still planning to airlift troops to the nine eastern provinces by American aircraft flown by Chinese pilots. (2) The Soviet side should take appropriate measures to ensure the safety of the current Chinese government officials in the nine eastern provinces. Judging from the current situation, the Soviet side has apparently agreed to protect them, as some Chinese government officials who remained in Changchun canceled their withdrawal at the last minute. The same source also told United Press International that the Chinese government has notified the Soviet government that if the completion of the Soviet troop withdrawal is delayed beyond the timeframe stipulated in the Sino-Soviet Treaty, the Chinese government fully understands this necessity. The Soviet side's attitude toward the Chinese government's suggestions is currently unknown, and no reply has been received from Moscow.

### Personnel Withdrawing from Changchun Awaiting Opportunity to Return to Their Posts in Beiping

[United Press International Beiping, 24th] A total of more than 300 officials from the National Government who were to take over the nine northeastern provinces have been withdrawing since the 17th of this month. United Press International reporters have learned the following information from other reliable sources:

Changchun is not openly occupied by the Communist army, but the mayor and the chief of public security are both inclined to the Eighth Route Army. Neither of the two are Communists, nor are they military officers. The Communist army has appointed a new mayor, but he has not yet taken office. In recent days, public sentiment has greatly stabilized because Chongqing has announced that it has reached an agreement with the Soviet Union on takeover arrangements.

The first group of Central personnel to arrive in Changchun were warmly welcomed by the people, who eagerly inquired when the National Army would arrive. Chongqing has already screened films about the situation in Changchun. November 7 was the anniversary of the Soviet Revolution, and Soviet Commander Malinovsky hosted a banquet to entertain the Chinese delegation, with many speeches focusing on Sino-Soviet friendship. Two days later, the Chinese delegation reciprocated, and on November 12, the Ministry of Communications and the Post Office were taken over and transferred to the Central Government's management. At this time, relations between the two sides were quite tense due to the Yingkou incident. The Communist army entered Yingkou after the Soviet army withdrew and fired at U.S. transport ships carrying landing National Army soldiers.

It is rumored that Xiong Shihui returned to Chongqing with some of the Soviet side's demands or handover conditions, but this has not been confirmed. According to the Beiping Yishi Bao, the Soviet army had already begun to withdraw from Changchun in accordance with the Sino-Soviet Treaty, but at this time ordered 20,000 troops to return to Changchun to maintain order. Most of the nine eastern provinces are now under the control of the Communist army. Of the seven newspapers in Changchun, six have been taken over by the Eighth Route Army, and the radio station is also under the jurisdiction of the Communist army. It is said that 40,000 to 60,000 Japanese soldiers were not disarmed and fled to northern Jilin Province to confront the Communist army, but this has not been confirmed. Japanese residents in the Northeast and most of the disarmed Japanese soldiers are waiting quietly to be sent back to their country. It is said that both Britain and the Soviet Union are paying close attention to the diplomatic situation, and this concern is very helpful to the National Government. The takeover personnel who withdrew from Changchun are still staying here, waiting for the opportunity to return to their posts.

### Shi Zhiren Reports: Traffic Conditions

[Central News Agency Beiping, 24th] Shi Zhiren, a special commissioner of the Ministry of Communications, went to Tianjin from Beiping today. According to him, the Beining Railway's eastbound traffic has passed Yuguan and reached Suizhong, and the Pingcheng Railway is open to Miyun. It is reported that a large number of bandits are entrenched north of Miyun, causing disturbances and harassing the area along the way. As of the 16th, more than 100 of our personnel had died. The Pingsui Railway is open to Nankou in the east, and the Pinghan Railway is open to Shijiazhuang. However, two piers of the Hutuo River bridge have been destroyed by bandits, and the Xinle River bridge has been repaired and opened to traffic. Where it has been destroyed by bandits, it is still necessary to walk for communication. Two places between Tianjin and Tangshan have been destroyed by bandits. The Jinpu Railway is open to Cangxian, and the section between Dexian and Jinan is being repaired urgently. The section between Xuzhou and Bengbu is open to traffic, and the section between Xuzhou and Jinan is not open because of bandits entrenched in Zouxian, Tengxian, and Lincheng. The Jiaoji Railway is open between Qingdao and Jinan. The Pinghan Railway is open between Zhengzhou and Hankou, and between Xinxiang and Zhangde. The Longhai Railway is open between Luoyang and Zhengzhou. The section between Zhengzhou and Zhongmou has been destroyed by bandits and is not open. The Weishan Bridge and Yangquan in the section between Shijiazhuang and Taiping on the Zhengtai Railway have been destroyed by bandits and cannot be opened to traffic. The engineering teams of the railway authorities are cooperating with the military's progress to repair the sections destroyed by bandits.

### Communist Troops Move from Hebei to Rehe; Another Route Fleeing West from Baotou Attempts to Disturb Western Sui

[United Press Beiping, 24th] The Foreign Affairs Office of the 11th War Zone reported today that the Communist army is moving on a large scale from Hebei Province to Rehe, thus advancing parallel to the Central Army towards the Northeast. At the same time, some Communist troops are advancing along the Pingsui Railway towards Datong. It is said that since November 11, bandits from the Eighth Route Army have been moving north one after another towards Rehe. Whenever they pass through villages in Hebei, they forcibly collect grain from the farmers. Their route follows the highway through Sanhe, Xianghe, Yutian, and Fengzhen, all between Beiping and Shanhaiguan.

[Central News Agency Guisui, 24th] Two groups of Communist troops, about 1,000 to 2,000 people, are fleeing west from the vicinity of Baotou. One group has fled to the Yingpan of the Western Gongqi of the Urat Front Banner, and the other has fled into the Taichong area in Anbei, with the intention of disturbing Western Sui.

[Central News Agency Qingdao, 23rd] The Communist army in Shandong had a plan to try to obstruct the National Army's westward advance along the Jiaoji Railway. At 10:30 p.m. on the 23rd, the two strongest regiments, the 13th and 14th, of the Communist 5th Division, attacked a unit of the National Army Du Jian Dao's force, Wang Jiazhen's camp, stationed in Lancun. The National Army immediately deployed and dealt them a severe blow. After fierce fighting until 7:00 a.m. on the 22nd, the bandits were defeated and fled in disarray towards Mashan. In this battle, more than 400 bandits were killed or wounded, more than 170 bodies were abandoned, including many mid-level bandit leaders, and 13 bandits were captured. A number of Type 38 rifles were seized. The National Army suffered only two wounded. This was the first attack suffered by the National Army after arriving in Qingdao.

### Communist Troops in Southern Henan Increase Support and Cause Disturbances

[Central News Agency Kaifeng, 23rd] More than 8,000 troops of Li Xiannian's Communist army in southern Henan, with several artillery pieces attached, fled to the Sujiahe Qianjiapeng area on the 19th to cause disturbances and attack our local teams. At the same time, the Communist 117th Regiment greatly increased its support. After a day and night of fierce fighting, they are now occupying Doushahe.

### Lock Mow Kes and Others Visit Chairman Chiang in Chongqing to Discuss the Situation in the Northeast

[United Press International Chongqing, 24th] Major General Lock, commander of the U.S. Marine Corps 3rd Amphibious Force, and Major General Wootton came to Chongqing from Shanghai today to pay their respects to Chairman Chiang. According to reliable sources, Chairman Chiang has, in the past few days, discussed the situation in North China and the Northeast, and related international issues, with U.S. 7th Fleet Commander Barbey, U.S. Assistant Secretary of the Navy Gates, and Truman's representative on the Japanese Reparations Committee, Pauley. Well-informed sources said that Chairman Chiang and Major General Lock will continue to discuss the above issues. It is also learned that Gates, Pauley, Barbey and others left Chongqing yesterday.

[United Press International Chongqing, 24th] Truman's envoy on Japanese reparations, Pauley, U.S. Assistant Secretary of the Navy Gates, and Rear Admiral Lysons have completed their inspection here and flew to Okinawa today. Gates will go to Manila, and Pauley will return to Tokyo.

### We Organize Committee to Take Over US Supplies Left in China-India-Burma

[Central News Agency Chongqing, 24th] In order to take over the supplies left by the U.S. military in China, India, and Burma, the Executive Yuan specially ordered the four ministries of military affairs, finance, economy, and communications, the Production Bureau, the Transportation Management Bureau, the Aviation Commission, the Health Department, and the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, to each send representatives to jointly organize a committee to be responsible for handling the matter. It is learned that the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration has appointed Chief Technician Hua Fengxiang as its representative.

[Central News Agency Chongqing, 24th] It is learned that some of the U.S. military's surplus materials have been sold to the China Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, part of which will be shipped to Shanghai to be used for relief in our country. The materials shipped include barley, flour, medical supplies, food, clothing, vehicles, building materials, and raw materials, totaling approximately 50,000 tons.

### U.S. Military Appoints Special Committee to Assist in Suppressing Prices in This City; General Wedemeyer Expresses Determination Yesterday

[Report from Our Newspaper] General Wedemeyer, Commander of the U.S. Forces in China (pictured), hosted reporters at the Shanghai base headquarters of the Construction Building yesterday, accompanied by General Stratemeyer. General Wedemeyer gave detailed answers to the questions raised by the reporters, especially regarding the prices in Shanghai, firmly expressing the need to suppress them. General Wedemeyer declared that there are unscrupulous merchants in this city who are taking advantage of the opportunity to raise prices and defraud U.S. military personnel. I have already taken effective measures for this matter and have appointed a special committee to discuss reasonable principles for handling it. If the general merchants still cannot take care of commercial ethics and continue to raise prices in an illegal manner, the headquarters will take decisive measures, strictly prohibiting the U.S. military from trading with them, and adding a statement that these measures do not contain any intention of intimidation, but rather express the U.S. military's determination to suppress prices. The following are the answers to the reporters' questions:

Considering Allocating Ships to Help Us Transport Troops to the Northeast

(1) The Chinese authorities have allocated many ships to the government in order to transport troops to the Northeast, and the U.S. government is considering this. The Chinese side has not yet announced whether to land in Huludao and Yingkou. (2) In the Northeast—including the area north of Shanhaiguan—the United States currently has not a single soldier stationed. Since the Soviet Union joined the war against Japan on August 8, the U.S. military has withdrawn all its intelligence personnel, and the Northeast has also been incorporated into the Soviet war zone and is not under the jurisdiction of the Chinese Theater Command. Therefore, all issues in the Northeast are now directly negotiated by China and the Soviet Union. (3) The entire U.S. military policy in China must be decided by the U.S. government. My job is to implement the policy, not to establish it. General Wedemeyer continued: As of now, the U.S. government has not instructed to withdraw the U.S. military from North China.

Lend-Lease Materials Continue to be Delivered to Our Government

(4) The contract for the supply of materials and the fitting out of the Chinese army under the Lend-Lease Act still exists. The current instructions of the U.S. government are to continue to deliver the materials that have already been shipped and are en route to the Chinese Central Government. According to the provisions of the contract, the U.S. should equip 39 divisions of the Central Army. Twenty divisions have been equipped and trained, and the remaining 19 divisions are currently being equipped. General Wedemeyer continued: Zhou Enlai mentioned in Chongqing that the U.S. would equip 70 divisions of the Central Army, but this is a misunderstanding. (5) The U.S. authorities originally had a plan to assist China in establishing a new army, navy, and air force, but they have not yet received formal instructions on organizing a military advisory group.

Sending Japanese Prisoners of War Back to Their Country, Only 3,000 Can Be Shipped Back Each Day

(6) Regarding the repatriation of Japanese prisoners of war, under the current circumstances, the transportation tools available to the U.S. authorities can only ship back 3,000 people per day. By the end of this month, the U.S. military should be able to repatriate 35,000 Japanese prisoners of war. According to U.S. military statistics, there are 500,000 Japanese prisoners of war in the area north of Shanhaiguan and south of the Yellow River. If all of them are to be repatriated, it will take at least six to eight months. Also, General MacArthur said that if his duties in Japan are slightly less busy in the short term, he plans to visit China.

### Unifying the Allocation of Ships; Establishing a New Organization

Liu Hongsheng and Lu Zuofu to Preside

[Report from Our Newspaper Chongqing, 24th] The Ship Allocation Committee will be established on the 1st of next month to unify the command of Changjiang (Yangtze River) vessels for military and civilian use, with Liu Hongsheng and Lu Zuofu serving as chairman and vice-chairman respectively. They will work within the Ministry of Communications. A chairman's office will be established separately in Shanghai, to be headed by Xu Xueyu, with offices set up in Yichang, Hankou, Nanjing, Tianjin, and Qingdao. The original Ship Management Office of the Logistics Department, the Water Transport Administration of the Wartime Transportation Bureau, and the Changjiang Reinstatement Committee will all be abolished. It is also reported that the Minlian ship left Chongqing at 6:30 a.m. on the 22nd.

### Our Scientists Invent a New Treatment for Stomach Ulcers

[United Press International New York, 23rd] New York University Medical School has, after many years of research, invented a new treatment for stomach ulcers. It is said that it can relieve the patient's pain within four hours. The inventor is Dr. Guo Tai (transliteration), a Chinese scientist. His method is to feed the patient a pre-digested protein "Amikeen." After two or three weeks, when checked with X-rays, the symptoms disappear.

### Chairman Chiang to Announce Economic Measures to be Adopted by the Government Tomorrow

We Notify the United States of Approval of International Monetary Agreement

[Central News Agency Chongqing, 24th] It is learned that Chairman Chiang will make an important announcement on the afternoon of the 26th of this month (Monday) regarding the current economic situation in the country and the measures the government plans to take.

[United Press International Washington, 23rd] Treasury Secretary Vinson announced today that the Chinese Embassy has notified the State Department that the country has approved the Bretton Woods Monetary Agreement. The approver is China, second only to the United States. The agreement provides for the stabilization of international currencies and the establishment of an international bank to assist in reconstruction. The agreement must be signed by 65 percent of the participating countries to take effect.

3.  Writing about Kazakhs in a Blessed Land

Today, the so-called Kazakh issue, whether considered from the perspective of race, history, or geographical environment, can all prove that this is merely a domestic matter among the northwestern branches of the Chinese nation, and is absolutely not a minority ethnic issue. Looking back at ancient history, the Kazakh people are actually the descendants of the Kangju people of the Han Dynasty. One group of mixed-race people have been nomadic in Central Asia for a long time, and their descendants have forgotten their ancestors, claiming that the Kazakhs are the same as the Kyrgyz people of Central Asia. According to my personal investigations in Gansu and Xinjiang provinces recently, the distribution area of ​​pure Kazakhs is in Yili, Tacheng, Qitai, Usu, Zhenxi, Yanqi, and Dihua, with a population of 500,000. There are more than 100,000 in the area bordering Xinjiang and Mongolia and the undetermined borders between China and the Soviet Union. Since 1938 (Republic of China year 27), less than 20,000 Kazakhs have migrated from Zhenxi to the Hexi region of Gansu and within Qinghai Province. According to Jin Zaiye, the commissioner of the Qinghai-Kangding border region of the Military Commission, there are now also a small number of Kazakhs in Tibet, numbering less than 500. The skin color of the Kazakhs is light black with a slightly reddish tinge, they are hairy and plump, and their physique is great, different from the Tibetans. Their language and writing are slightly similar to the Hui people. Very few are literate, and illiteracy accounts for 90%. The Kazakhs began to believe in Islam from the 16th century. They gradually like to use Chinese surnames. They are skilled in riding and shooting and love to eat smoked meat. They live in wind and sand all year round, are naturally wild and unrestrained, do not understand what laws are, and looting has become a common practice. They need education and do not understand what is called "autonomy". Saying that they also want "autonomy" is really like the sign opposite the Grand Theater, "Heaven Knows".

When I visited the leaders of the Kazakhs who had surrendered in Hexi, Hu Shekusman and his partner, I told them in detail about the government's concern for the lives of the Kazakh people in Zhangye, Jiuquan, and Dunhuang, and the news of providing them with food and cash, as well as many Kazakh women waiting for news inside and outside. They were moved to tears. They have been able to understand that giving them weapons is not necessarily an act of "benevolence." They reverently looked at a portrait of Chairman Jiang hanging on the wall and said to me in the Hui language: "This big official is bigger than Chief Zhu, and even more benevolent."

4.  Hexi Today

Hexi is the corridor of the Gansu-Xinjiang passage, shaped like a wasp waist on the map. Qinghai and Ningxia are on its two sides. The four prefectures of Hexi established during the Han Dynasty under Emperor Wu, the four great cities of Wuwei, Zhangye, Jiuquan, and Dunhuang, have all become important hubs of the Gansu-Xinjiang road today. It is now under the jurisdiction of the sixth and seventh administrative inspectorates of Gansu, governing a total of sixteen counties and one establishment bureau. Jiuquan County has a population of only 140,000, the land is barren, the people are poor, and water conservancy needs to be developed. The food that the common people earn from hard work throughout the year is difficult to make ends meet after deducting various burdens. When the army passes through and there is not enough vegetables, in the extremely difficult areas of Anxi, Jinta, and Dingxin, the common people almost take out the only dish of vegetables they have left to help the army without any complaints. Most of them have not received education. In these three counties, I only met two high school graduates, but their patriotic enthusiasm is no less than that of the southeast. Their markets are still based on the barter system of ancient times. In the countryside of Jinta, it is rare to see banknotes. There is neither hoarding nor speculation there. The suffering that the people of Hexi have endured over the years, and the importance of the Hexi region, are well known to people with a little geographical knowledge. I observed Hexi for two months. I saw that this year's wheat harvest in Hexi was not bad, averaging more than 70%. The quality of wheat is particularly good. In Gaotai and Zhangye, every hundred catties of wheat can be ground into ten more catties of flour. Water conservancy projects in Hexi, such as the Yuanyang Pond west of Jiuquan and the Sanqing Canal in Gaotai County, have been successfully built. The Sanqing Canal has recently been completed and has started releasing water. However, apart from this, the construction of water conservancy has not yet reached the ideal stage. The reservoir in the Qilian Mountains must be built, but it has not been built yet because of lack of funds and difficulty in obtaining materials.

Speaking of water conservancy in Hexi, one cannot help but think of transportation in the northwest. The focus of Gansu's construction is "water conservancy first" and "transportation first." Water conservancy work is already underway, and we are temporarily looking forward to it, but when it comes to the current state of transportation, it is much worse. During the tenure of Director He Jingwu of the Northwest Highway Bureau, it is said that he devoted all his efforts to "military affairs first," so now there are roads but no cars, and cars, though available, stop from time to time. Before August, there were no scheduled buses in Hexi, and it is hard to say now. Postal transport also has to rely on animal power. The distance from Lanzhou to Liangzhou (Wuwei) is 200 kilometers, and a car can reach it in one day, but the delivery of newspapers and letters often takes a week. Letters sent to the west of Jiayuguan will of course take dozens of days.

On the way back east from Hexi, I was very fortunate to meet Mr. Ju Juesheng and Mr. Fan Songfu in Zhangye. Mr. Ju came to see the current state of justice in the northwest and took the opportunity to travel to Hexi. Mr. Fan came to inspect military discipline. My welcoming words to the two gentlemen were only four words: "You've come at the right time." Later, thanks to Mr. Ju's consideration, he asked me several times about my impressions of Hexi. My frank report was as follows: "The most urgent task in Hexi is to increase production, but poor farmers pawn their farm tools, and the monthly interest they bear reaches 200 per thousand. To increase production, water conservancy must be planned first, but unfortunately, most of the water conservancy workers are idle. Politics is improving, transportation still needs effort, and the power of the gentry is greater than everything. The entire budget of the county health center is so small that it is not even as much as the personal expenses of a doctor, so the people are still sick."

### Nanjing Massacre – Investigation to be Announced Soon – [Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 24th Dispatch]

The Capital's Committee Investigating the Crimes of Japanese Invaders has been working diligently for the past month. A preliminary investigation has been completed and will be announced soon. This shocking crime of the Nanjing Massacre will be illustrated with the most reliable evidence, revealing its cruelty and madness. According to reports from the Red Swastika Society and the Chongshan Hall, they jointly organized five burial teams which worked continuously for over four months and buried 155,338 corpses of men, women, and children. This figure does not include burials by private teams. It is estimated that at least 200,000 of our compatriots were brutally murdered. Currently, the citizens of Nanjing are lodging dozens of accusations daily with the Crimes Investigation Committee against the Japanese invaders for rape, drowning, and torture.

Saturday Forum: Political Consultation Conference by Zhang Shizhao.

The Political Consultation Conference is established for the government and various factions to jointly determine national policies. However, the name of this conference, its regulations, the number of representatives, and the selection of personnel have remained unannounced for several months since its inception. Although there is news of a convening on the first of next month, it is uncertain when Zhou Enlai, the representative of the Chinese Communist Party, will fly to Yan'an and when he will return to the accompanying capital. Who can be certain? Alas, this conference is as difficult as assembling a Tangram puzzle! Nevertheless, the day of announcement is not the day of success. It is expected that the difficulties will be a hundredfold greater after the announcement. Some say, "Again and again, the government and the Chinese Communist Party consult and deliberate on all major military and political plans, and the framework has long been established outside the conference. At the conference table, they only supplement and repair it formally. What difficulty is there?" As for the various parties and non-party factions, they are like stage props, merely for decoration and of little importance. Therefore, this conference should either not be held at all, or if it is held, it will inevitably succeed. To assess the difficulty and then plan accordingly is no different from the worries of the man of Qi who feared the sky would fall. This is what I doubt.

The origin of this conference lies in the Communist Party's lack of restraint. However, the Communist Party's lack of restraint is in military matters, not political matters. Seeking military power, there is military strength, and in politics, there is political power. If military strength can determine the world, then the government, like Yu the Great taming dragons, could drive out the Communist Party and be done with it. Why rely on this conference? This conference is to address the imbalance of political power, which military strength cannot. Speaking of political power, the Communist Party can only represent a small part of the public opinion of the whole people, while the various parties and non-party factions represent a larger number, yet the larger number seems powerless. Even if the government does not harbor any intention of entrusting power, it seems to be yielding before yielding. From now on, the Communist Party will use the various parties to assert itself, and the latter will attach themselves to the former to make themselves seen. Their intention seems to be, "Only when the Communist Party is in chaos does the government realize the presence of the various parties. Otherwise, in the past twenty years, where has there been any spark of public opinion to be expressed?" This is merely a case of Zhao and Meng vying for importance. I have long lamented this.

I have long advocated national harmony through reconciliation, but reconciliation, as a concept, will inevitably fail if not implemented with genuine spirit. Conferences of this kind, which have been convened and failed throughout history, both in China and abroad, are too numerous to count. The Estates-General in France are a prominent example. The Estates comprised three orders: the nobility, the clergy, and the commoners. In the time of Louis XVI, these three estates represented the entirety of France. After the French Revolution, the nation's politics became unstable, resembling the chaotic situation in China since the Xinhai Revolution. Therefore, in 1787, the Declaration of the Parliament of Paris proposed the Estates-General for consultation to consolidate the foundation of the nation, which is somewhat similar to our current conference using the Political Participation Council as its basis. However, Louis XVI initially favored the first two estates to suppress the commoners, then gradually used the commoners to curtail the first two estates. The three estates were mutually hostile, manipulated without restraint, ultimately leading to a great disaster. Following the ill fate of Louis' dynasty, it ended as an empty historical relic. This is because the true meaning of reconciliation was lost.

Based on public concerns and clear historical examples, I propose three points for consideration: First, the government must recognize the true strength of the entire nation and use sincerity and openness as the cornerstone of the conference. Do not treat it lightly, allowing it to succeed or fail, merely viewing this conference as a hyphen and seeking its meaning elsewhere. Second, the Communist Party must lay down its arms and show genuine patriotism to the world. The strength of its military should not determine the value of this conference. Third, the various parties and non-party figures should act with utmost sincerity, uphold independent views, not be cat's paws for others, nor be at the back of the ox, belittling themselves and burdening the nation. With these three principles clarified, the conference can be successfully held. If any one of them is not fulfilled, it is better not to hold it. Not only should the French Estates-General serve as a warning, but also the failed National Crisis Conference in Luoyang in the past is not far behind.

UN Agency Preparatory Committee General Assembly Opens Yesterday – British Representative Speaks Strongly Advocating Control of Atomic Energy – [Reuters, London, 24th Dispatch]

The United Nations Preparatory Committee held its first meeting today. The British representative, Baker, criticized the pessimists who have recently become active again. Baker said, "I feel comforted that our work will not be achieved in a moment." The work of the Preparatory Committee is to review and adopt the recommendations decided upon by the Executive Committee, composed of fourteen countries, after ten weeks of intensive work. All fifty-one member states attended today, and the meeting was virtually a general assembly of a United Nations agency. Baker said, "I deeply believe that the United Nations can meet the test of the times, and other countries also believe that the British people are determined not to let this effort fail again." Today, more than one country fears the recurrence of war. It is highly inappropriate for anyone to say that some governments are still willing to start wars or are even preparing for war. Governments have already switched from wartime production to peacetime production. No nation in the world, especially its government, can start a war again." Baker then described the urgent tasks of the first United Nations General Assembly, saying, "Governments must do some work for their people regarding science. Aviation, which was invented 44 years ago, has been cursed by humanity. If atomic energy is not controlled, it will exterminate mankind. This is a human invention and must be controlled by humans." "Our government should establish an organization through the United Nations agency, gather the efforts of great individuals, and make atomic energy serve humanity instead of destroying it. May the institutions we plan to establish forever eliminate the crimes of war." The Soviet representative, Gromyko, suggested, and the Bolivian representative, Salamanca, seconded, to postpone the meeting until next Monday to give the representatives sufficient time to consider the agenda. Later, during the Executive Committee's discussion of the draft agenda, the Brazilian Ambassador to Britain, Valler, was elected Chairman.

Second Day of Foreign Policy Debate – Highlights of British Foreign Secretary's Speech – Determined to Establish Peace by Engaging with All Countries on a Foundation of Justice and Strengthening the United Nations – [Central News Agency Reporter Ren Lingsun, 23rd, London Dispatch]

The British House of Commons continued its debate on foreign policy this afternoon. British Foreign Secretary Bevin attended and delivered a speech outlining international relations, listing three main points: (1) The British government will adhere to the principle of engaging with all countries, large and small, on a just basis. (2) Only frankness can eliminate international suspicion. (3) The British government firmly believes that the United Nations is the instrument for laying the foundation for international security. Britain is prepared to strengthen the power of the United Nations and hopes to see this new organization continue to develop into a true world assembly with international law as its pillar and a world police force to enforce this international law. In addition, Bevin also touched on other issues. Regarding the atomic bomb issue, he believed that since the first General Assembly of the United Nations is scheduled to convene in January next year, there is no need to hold a special meeting to consider the atomic bomb proposals jointly drafted by Attlee, Truman, and King. He believed that the Security Council, once established, will consider the proposals for establishing an atomic energy commission.

Therefore, the Committee decided to send personnel to visit Japan. The Committee meeting today lasted for two hours, reviewing economic documents prepared by the China-America-Australia subcommittee. After careful consultation, the meeting made revisions and passed it. The next meeting of the Committee will discuss a report on general policy and orders issued by the Allied occupation forces regarding the economy.

Investigation of the Attack on Pearl Harbor – Former Secretary of State Hull Testifies the Day Before Yesterday – [Reuters, Washington, 24th Dispatch]

Former Secretary of State Hull told the Congressional Committee investigating Pearl Harbor that in the final, tense days of diplomatic negotiations in 1941, he did not consider the possibility of a Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. He also said that during the Atlantic Conference held by Churchill and President Roosevelt that summer, when the Atlantic Charter was drafted, Churchill stated that Britain would need a long time to prepare before engaging in military action in the Pacific. However, after the President returned to Washington, he told the Japanese ambassador that if Japan did not stop its aggression, the United States would take self-defense measures. Hull also defended himself and President Roosevelt, saying that the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor was not caused by American provocation. Although he had warned Roosevelt and others that the Japanese military might attack at any time and in any place, the initial focus of the American military remained in the Western Pacific. Hull has detailed records of the US-Japan negotiations, which can prove that he and President Roosevelt worked hard to prevent the Japanese militarists from engaging in aggressive behavior in Asia.

Japanese Atomic Experiment Facility – Thoroughly Destroyed by Allied Forces – Ten Years of Effort Come to Nothing – Dr. Nishina Witnessed with Grief – [United Press, 24th Dispatch]

The Nishina Laboratory, affiliated with the Tokyo Institute of Physical and Chemical Research, which has a 300-ton American-made cyclotron, has now learned that MacArthur has ordered the device to be destroyed today. After this, Japan will be unable to research atomic energy or manufacture atomic bombs. Four other small cyclotrons have also been ordered to be destroyed by MacArthur. It is unknown whether this action was authorized by Washington. In addition, the two Nishina cyclotrons at Kyoto and Osaka Imperial Universities were also destroyed and dumped into the sea. Nishina is Japan's most renowned atomic physicist. It is said that the destruction of this enormous cyclotron is extremely unfortunate. He told his secretary, Yokoyama, "The destruction of this device means that my ten years of effort have come to nothing. I don't know what to do now, but I will continue to study cosmic rays."

Research History

Japan's research on atomic energy was six years behind the United States. If sufficient resources had been available, the now-destroyed cyclotron could have produced enough atomic energy to manufacture an atomic bomb within a year. Compared to those in the United States, the cyclotrons in Nishina's laboratory were insignificant. However, if they had not been destroyed, they could have been donated to other countries for research purposes. Nishina began researching atomic energy in 1935, initially using a 23-ton electromagnet as the base for the cyclotron, but it was unsuitable. Between 1937 and 1938, Nishina obtained a 220-ton electromagnet from the atomic energy equipment of the radiation laboratory at the University of California, and then actively began to research atomic energy.

Original Slant Lack

Professor Lawrence, the inventor of the cyclotron and one of the manufacturers of the atomic bomb, provided various forms of assistance to Nishina's research. In 1941, Nishina and his colleagues considered mass-producing atomic energy, known as "U-235," but the Japanese military knew nothing of the importance of atomic energy, and there was also a lack of sufficient potassium for application, so it was abandoned. After Hiroshima and Nagasaki were bombed with atomic bombs, Japanese scientists resumed their enthusiastic research on atomic energy. Nishina also said that he had 22 pounds of uranium and originally thought of separating it by diffusion, but unfortunately, the laboratory with this type of equipment was destroyed by American aircraft during an air raid. Although all the buildings in Nishina's laboratory were destroyed, the one housing the cyclotron remained intact, which was also a coincidence.

One Basket

Because the device was too large, it was placed on the lowest floor of the building. Although the United States knew that Japan had a cyclotron, it did not know the extent to which it had been researched. Before issuing the order, MacArthur sent people to Nishina's laboratory on the 20th of this month to search for all records relating to the cyclotron to prevent them from being lost. According to the head of the physics department at Kyoto Imperial University, Japan only became interested in atomic energy at the end of 1944. At the beginning of 1945, the Naval Ordinance Bureau asked him if he could manufacture an atomic bomb. He replied that he could not. In June of this year, the Navy gave him 16 boxes of uranium and instructed him to continue his research, but Japan soon surrendered, and the sixteen boxes of sleeves have not yet been used.

Academization of Educational Administration by Chen Xuanshan

Academization of educational administration is not a high-sounding term, nor is it the talk of bookworms, but it is something that can and should be done practically. The so-called academization of educational administration at least includes two meanings: The first meaning is that the handling of all administrative work should be based on a research attitude. The most fearful thing in administrative work is mechanization and routine. If everything is done according to precedents and one is spinning around in "etc., etc.," there will never be progress. Educational work should be "new every day." When dealing with something, one should always ask "Why do we do it?" "Why do we do it this way?"

To give a few simple examples: Now all agencies hold memorial weeks. We should ask "Why do we hold memorial weeks?" "How can we fulfill the original mission of memorial weeks?" "How can memorial weeks have a positive impact on the work of the participants?" Similarly, when holding entrance examinations, we should ask "Why do we hold entrance examinations?" "What impact will the entrance examination have on students?" "What possible malpractices are there in the entrance examination, and how can these malpractices be avoided?" If we can use this research capacity to handle administrative work, then all undertakings will have hope of improvement, and people who handle administration can also increase their interest in work.

I think the first thing people who handle administrative work should not do is be "messy," and the second thing they should not do is be "too busy." If they are too busy, they will easily be "messy." It is said that "busyness" has a relationship. Everyone should have plenty of special questions, a research attitude, and a clear mind to think about everything.

The second point is that educational administrative work must not be a one-way command from top to bottom. In many things, we should solicit and accommodate the opinions of colleagues, discuss and study together before making a decision. In this way, people who participate in the opinion, no matter their position, feel that they have a share in the decision, and their interest in work is invisibly increased. If the people above act arbitrarily, the people below can only mechanically execute orders, gradually developing a habit of reliance and perfunctoriness, the so-called "not seeking merit but seeking no demerit," then all undertakings will be lifeless and there will be no progress.
