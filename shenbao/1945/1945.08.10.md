### The First Town on the Shanghai-Hangzhou Line—Xiashi

—Dong Changqing

Xiashi, located fifty li southwest of Jiaxing, is the leading of the four major towns under the jurisdiction of Haiyan County. Among the towns along the Shanghai-Hangzhou Line, it can be called the foremost town. It originally belonged to the Second District of Haiyan County, but after the war, due to the remoteness and inconvenient transportation of the Haiyan County seat, the county government temporarily moved its administration here. The county government, party headquarters, local court, security team headquarters, county chamber of commerce, and other organizations are all stationed in this town. The current population is approximately 130,000, the same as before the war. For security, there is a company of security team soldiers permanently stationed, along with nearly a hundred police officers and detectives from the police station. In addition, friendly forces are stationed nearby, so the local area is considered relatively peaceful.

Overview of Industry and Commerce

Xiashi is a crucial transportation hub on the Shanghai-Hangzhou line, with inland country roads extending in all directions. The main exports are rice, tobacco, and silk, followed by homespun cloth and wool. These products are gathered in Xiashi and sold to Shanghai and Hangzhou, making commerce extremely prosperous, far exceeding that of other towns such as Chang'an, Yuanhua, and Luzhong.

Before the war, the most prosperous industries were knitting and homespun cloth weaving, which were sold in major cities such as Shanghai, Hangzhou, and Tianjin. The silk industry and cotton weaving were secondary. After the war, due to material and transportation constraints, these industries declined sharply, almost to a standstill.

Recently, the cigarette industry has been more active, with cigarette shops springing up like mushrooms after rain, numbering thirty to forty large and small. They rely on peddlers who transport cigarettes, soap, candles, matches, and other daily necessities from Shanghai and Hangzhou, and then sell them to villages and towns in neighboring counties, such as those belonging to Tongxiang, Haiyan, and Haining. There are over ten department stores, with Da Xing Heng being the largest in scale, having branches in various towns along the Shanghai-Hangzhou Line. There are thirty to forty rice shops, which are also thriving due to the help of peddlers and are concentrated on Rice Market Street. There are eight or nine transportation companies, but due to the recent reduction in railway freight transport and the tendency to break down goods into smaller units carried by peddlers, business has been declining. The First Soap Factory produces first-class "Ship Brand" and other domestically-made soaps, which are sold in villages and towns. Most businesses in the town are operated as partnerships, with few sole proprietorships, and they rely on financing from the financial sector, so their economic management is relatively smooth. The financial sector includes the Central Reserve Bank office, a branch of the Zhejiang Provincial Bank, and a branch of a certain bank from Hangzhou, as well as over ten private banks. Recently, prices have risen sharply, and most people lack purchasing power, causing the market to be depressed. The expenses of various industries are high, taxes are heavy, and many businesses have voluntarily closed down.

In the past, it was famous for its lanterns and decorations, but due to the post-war environment and financial constraints, there is no longer the leisure for such things.

Public Utilities

Public welfare undertakings have been restored to their pre-war state because this town is the seat of the county government. In terms of education, there is the Provincial Haiyan High School and the Provincial Haiyan Normal School, along with six county-run primary schools and many private academies. However, due to insufficient funding and a lack of leadership, management is poor, and results are mediocre. Xiashi was once known for its strong literary culture, but after the war, due to environmental and financial constraints, it is difficult to develop, leading to its decline, which is truly regrettable. There are the county-run Haiyan Hospital and several private hospitals. Since it is not far from Shanghai and Hangzhou, the purchase of medicines is relatively convenient, so the facilities are reasonably satisfactory.

There was originally a Xiashi Daily newspaper, located on Qianhe Street, but due to insufficient funding and a lack of materials, it ceased publication at the end of last year. However, there are several shops that sell newspapers and books, so various Shanghai newspapers and books can be delivered on the same day.

For fire protection, there is a public fire department with six or seven diesel pumps, as well as volunteer fire brigades from various neighborhoods, equipped with over ten water pump hoses.

The commercially-run Xiashi Electric Light Company was established in 1913 and has two generators. Recently, due to a shortage of diesel, one has been converted to burn vegetable oil and the other to burn firewood. As a result, fees are calculated based on monthly prices, recently at 18,000 yuan per kilowatt-hour. Due to the high electricity costs, many ordinary households have switched to using vegetable oil lamps. The company also has a telephone service, with 200 households in the town having installed phones, charged on a monthly basis. Long-distance calls require transfer through Jiaxing.

Transportation is relatively convenient. There are two daily bus services to Shanghai and Hangzhou. Waterways extend in all directions, relying on boats and fast boats. There are daily services to towns such as Tongxiang, Haining, Yuanhua, Shendang, Luzhong, Jiaxing, and Tudian.

A Glimpse of the Cityscape

The town of Xiashi is about six li long, with a river running through the middle, navigable by boats. The streets on both sides are the main streets. The streets on the east bank are known as Hedong Street, Dajie, and Dongnanhe, while the streets on the west bank are known as Hexi Street, Xiaojie, and Xinanhe. The cross streets include Qianhe Street, Cangji, Hengdai, Shangdong Street, and Xiadong Street. The southeastern edge of the town is attached to a small town called Hengtou.

The streets of Xiashi have shops lining the main streets, with vendors scattered about, and the houses are orderly. The street centers are paved with large stone slabs, clean and flat, facilitating the passage of rickshaws. Especially in the early morning, villagers from the surrounding countryside come to the town to buy and sell goods, crowding together in an extraordinary manner. The remaining streets are residential areas or factories, which are quiet and clean. Boats are constantly coming and going along the waterways, busy loading and unloading passengers and goods.

For entertainment, there is a Xiashi Theater located on Ganhe Street, which sometimes puts on Beijing, Hangzhou, Yue, and spoken dramas, and occasionally shows movies or variety shows, with two shows a day and night. The building is dilapidated, the facilities are simple, and the actors are mostly amateur troupes from the countryside, with mediocre skills, but many people watch the shows for free. There are also several storytelling teahouses, with many listeners.

There are three restaurants: Hongyunlou, Xiaoyoutian, and Dajiali. Due to the hot weather, with no air conditioning, they are temporarily closed. The remaining dozen or so local-style restaurants specialize in home-style meals, so business is still good. There is one bathhouse, which is dilapidated, and over ten hotels, with the First and Rongfa hotels being the better ones. There are prostitutes, female escorts, platform girls, and private prostitutes. Most are from Hangzhou, with some from Shanghai and local. They are all driven by the necessities of life, and few are beautiful.

Famous Scenic Spots and Historical Sites

Xiashi is located between Shen Mountain (commonly known as East Mountain) and Ziwei Mountain (West Mountain). The two mountains face each other, their appearance majestic. Old records refer to it as Jiagu, originally two mountains connected. When Emperor Qin Shi Huang toured the east, he believed that the mountain possessed royal energy, so he sent 100,000 prisoners to split it into two, one being East Mountain and the other West Mountain. The mountain roots on both sides of the Great Rainbow Bridge (commonly known as Pingqiao) under the city river are still exposed, said to be the place where Qin Shi Huang excavated, but this claim is not credible. The gap between the two mountains with water flowing through is called a gorge, originally written as "峽石" (gorge stone), but it was mistakenly written as "硤石" (narrow stone) after the Tang Dynasty. Historical records state that King Goujian of Yue stationed troops at Shuikou, which is now Xiashi Lake.

The town has Huili Temple, commonly known as the West Temple, which contains a palindrome wall with writing arranged like weaving, said to be a miraculous work of Lu Ban. Outside the mountain gate are stone pillars with inscriptions by Bai Juyi, and inside the precept hall is a statue of Bai Juyi. Unfortunately, the temple was recently burned down, leaving broken bricks and tiles in a desolate state.

The Zhibiao Pagoda stands tall on the peak of East Mountain, built by the eminent monk Zhibiao of the Eastern Jin Dynasty. Unfortunately, East Mountain has recently been designated as a military zone, making it impossible to climb and enjoy the view.

There is the Er Mao Pavilion on West Mountain, with inscriptions by former Chairman Wang in one, and calligraphy by Fu Shi in the other. From here, one can get a close view of the entire town, with its roofs closely packed together and dense population. In the distance, one can see the rural scenery, with houses and fields interspersed. Especially on moonlit nights, with the bright moon shining in the sky, the mountain scenery is even more clear. All sounds are silent, creating an extremely serene atmosphere that makes people feel refreshed and reluctant to leave. (Transferred to help education)

### Two Japanese Political Groups Merge into the Political Association

Tokyo, 9th (Central News Agency Dispatch) The Greater Japan Political Association is the only civilian political organization in Japan during wartime. The two other groups belonging to the House of Representatives, the Patriotic Comrades Association and the Yokusangikai Comrades Association, have reached a point where the urgent shift in the war situation and the demands of establishing a strong national power for decisive battles require the pooling of civilian political power. Recently, senior officials of the Political Association and the Patriotic Comrades Association engaged in negotiations. The President of the Political Association, Nan, and the President of the Patriotic Comrades Association, Ino, met on the 7th and, as a result of their sincere discussion, reached a consensus on merging the two groups. Therefore, President Nan issued a statement in the form of a conversation on the 8th. Simultaneously, the Patriotic Comrades Association held a special delegates meeting on the 9th to decide on dissolution and resolved that all members join the Political Association. In addition, the Yokusangikai Comrades Association, led by President Miura Kazuo, will also merge with the Political Association.

### Editorial: A Third Discussion on the Kuomintang and Constitutionalism
Regarding the issue of the Kuomintang (KMT) and democratic constitutionalism, we have repeatedly expressed our views based on Mr. Chen Gongbo's article, "A Re-examination of the Kuomintang," extending Mr. Gongbo's valuable opinions and, out of loyalty to the KMT and especially to the Republic of China, engaging in discussions with the nation. However, feeling that we have not fully expressed our thoughts, we present a further discussion.

In the chapter "An Analysis of the Kuomintang's Organization," Mr. Gongbo offers sincere and candid criticisms of the KMT's organization, training, and strategies. As Mr. Gongbo himself stated, "I am not intentionally criticizing the Party today, on the eve of the implementation of constitutionalism, to please those outside the Party. As a responsible member of the Kuomintang, I speak so earnestly precisely because I love it so deeply." Although we speak on behalf of the general public outside the KMT, we believe that our deep concern for the KMT is no less than that of Mr. Gongbo, and we share the same sincere expectation for the KMT's healthy progress. Therefore, regarding the KMT's organizational issues moving forward, we humbly wish to offer our humble suggestions on behalf of the majority of the people.

Regarding the KMT's organization, Mr. Gongbo details the necessity of keeping certain matters confidential. However, in principle, we still believe that political struggles are better conducted openly to facilitate closer interaction and understanding with the public. Nevertheless, we largely agree with Mr. Gongbo's guidance on the drawbacks of the Party being too open. We believe that the Party's openness must not become a disguised government office, turning into a ruler of the people rather than a protector of the people's rights. Such a result would not only alienate the Party from the people but also, as Mr. Gongbo said, easily lead Party members to become complacent, lose their fighting spirit and ambition, and indirectly lead to the Party's corruption and decline. This requires careful consideration as constitutionalism is implemented in the future.

Mr. Gongbo provides very valuable instructions regarding the KMT's training and strategies. Implementing these instructions is a fundamental condition for the KMT's future revival. In terms of training, the situation in China today is truly pathetic. It is a major question how many talented individuals the KMT has trained in the past twenty years. Whether in politics, military affairs, economics, or even culture, education, and propaganda, there is a lamentable shortage of talent among the top leaders in every sector in terms of the practical needs of revolution and national construction. However, on the other hand, there are indeed some rare talents, but due to the lack of talent-based politics and the struggles between party factions, they are either buried in obscurity or driven to take risks and be exploited by rival parties. Therefore, we hope that the KMT will not only thoroughly train its members within the Party, making them leaders of the people, but also assist in training and re-employing civilian talents to prepare for the emergence of talent-based politics when constitutionalism is implemented in the future.

Regarding strategies, from the perspective of ancient Chinese political philosophy, their value is denied. The political activities of Confucius, Mencius and those after them did not advocate the use of any strategies. However, in today's complex international situation and complex domestic political situation, dealing with political work does sometimes require strategies. However, strategies cannot be abused. Abusing strategies can, on a small scale, lead to the corruption and decline of the few party members who implement the strategies, as Mr. Gongbo pointed out, and on a large scale, can "provide resources to the enemy, harming oneself and endangering the country." Therefore, we believe that the Party's strategies must be based on the interests of the entire nation and the entire people, and not on the interests of a single party or faction. The implementation of the Party's strategies must be strictly supervised by the Party and cannot be left to the arbitrary decisions of a few individuals. While the strategies themselves must be flexible, their goals must be open, just, and can be made public afterwards. Otherwise, regardless of the temporary success or failure of the strategies, they will not benefit the Party or the country.

### Four Allied Nations Announce Rule Over Austria; Country Divided into Four Zones
Stockholm, 9th (Central News Agency) - The British Foreign Office last night issued a joint proclamation by the United Kingdom, the United States, the Soviet Union, and France on the political organization for the joint administration of Austria, stating in brief: The political organization for the Allied administration of Austria will include the Allied Council, the Executive Committee, and other general staff appointed by the four major Allied powers. The entire organization will be named the "Allied Council for Austria." The basic tasks of the Allied Council are: 1. To separate Austria from Germany. 2. To immediately establish a central Austrian governing body. 3. To prepare for the establishment of a free and democratically elected Austrian government. 4. To assist in the smooth conduct of Austrian administration. The Allied Council will include the military committees of the four countries, each of which will jointly exercise supreme power over the administration of Austria, striving to guide all administrative work under the management of the Allied Council. Regarding the future governance of Austria, once the central Austrian governing body is established, all administrative work will be immediately implemented under the Allied Council, and the Allied authorities will implement comprehensive management of the Vienna district under the direction of the Allied Council. The four major Allied powers have now decided to divide the entire Austria into four administrative zones, and the Vienna city area will also be divided.

### U.S. Strike Wave Spreads; Labor Unrest; Post-War Unemployment Expected to Surge
Tokyo, 9th (Central News Agency) - The recent abnormal instability in the U.S. labor front has gradually affected the entire U.S. economy. Due to the stagnation of its war spirit, strike waves have spread throughout the country. At the beginning of July this year, about 100,000 workers began strikes, most of which were in rubber factories in Ohio, directly affecting war-related military industries. Although the U.S. military has suppressed them, there is still a possibility of continued outbreaks. Even more seriously, many workers in military industries have begun to switch to other fields, especially workers in the most essential dockyard repair shops. This tendency is causing great distress to the U.S. military authorities. Although the number of strikers is not large now, there is a clear trend of increasing in the future. This labor unrest and the disorder of U.S. industrial discipline have already hinted at the U.S. situation. This strike wave, on the one hand, hinders the orderly conversion of wartime industries to peaceful industries, and on the other hand, it induces the government to forcibly enact labor laws, which further fuels labor unrest, which is something we should pay attention to. Currently, the U.S. Congress is considering the Hatch-Burton-Ball Act, which would deprive laborers of the special privileges they gained during the Roosevelt era and suppress labor activities, indicating the greatest anxiety in the U.S. labor sector because of the problem of 10 million to 18 million unemployed people after the war. Columbia University Professor Naville predicted that the U.S. will have 10 million unemployed after the war, while Ellis determined that in 1946, the U.S. will have about 11 million unemployed non-skilled workers, plus 8 million unemployed skilled workers, for a total of 19 million. The phenomenon of this quantity of unemployed people is inevitable. The U.S.'s union system is extremely chaotic, and the slightest impropriety can lead to a full strike. The number of union members who do not follow union guidance and government orders is increasing. One factory, in order to re-employ laborers returning from the battlefield, dismissed laborers who participated in World War I, causing the entire union to protest and ultimately strike. If the union agrees to the demands of the current striking workers and does not re-employ returning soldiers, then the majority of these newly discharged veterans will also become unemployed. This truly puts the U.S. labor sector in a dilemma. From this, we can deeply understand the distress of the U.S. labor front and the fact that the U.S. economy is about to enter a state of bankruptcy after the war.

### Proclamation by the Japanese Military Authorities
Since the Soviet Union has declared war on Japan, the Japanese and Soviet armies have entered a state of combat. The Supreme Commander of the Japanese Army and Navy in Shanghai issued a proclamation yesterday, expressing the belief that the Japanese army in Shanghai is determined to ensure the security of the area in light of the changing situation. Anyone who disturbs the peace will be punished by military law without exception. The proclamation is recorded as follows:

The Japanese General Headquarters announced on August 9th that the Soviet Union has entered a state of war with Japan and issued a battle report stating that a portion of the Soviet army has crossed the Soviet-Manchurian border and begun attacks. The Japanese and Manchurian armies in various locations have begun to counterattack for self-defense. Due to this fact, the Greater East Asia War has become increasingly complex and severe. However, the Japanese army in the area, considering the changing situation and preparing countermeasures without regret, will not be shaken by this situation and is determined to complete the Greater East Asia War. With the view of seeking China's unity and revitalization, the Japanese army will cooperate with the Chinese government, army, and people to complete the important task of ensuring local security. It is hoped that the Chinese officials and people in the area, as well as the overseas residents in Shanghai, will trust the Japanese army, closely cooperate, and cope with this changing situation. Please do not easily believe rumors and cause unrest and instability, and cooperate in the completion of the Greater East Asia War. Furthermore, if the following actions are taken to hinder the Japanese army's security and defense, the Japanese army will severely punish them according to military law:

According to reports from Moscow and other overseas sources, the Soviet government announced that it had entered a state of war with Japan on August 9th.

### Yesterday Was the 20th Air Defense Day; Various Drills Implemented; Police and Security Personnel Fully Mobilized
Yesterday (the 9th) was the 20th Air Defense Day. The Municipal Civil Air Defense Headquarters, following precedent, expanded its publicity of the meaning of air defense and implemented various air defense drills. The entire city entered a state of air defense, and the atmosphere was very tense. The details of each item are recorded as follows:

### Police and Security Mobilization
This air defense drill focused on comprehensive training at each air defense district as a unit. All police and security personnel were fully mobilized, and various comprehensive trainings were implemented under the command of the branch chiefs at designated locations and times. In the evening, strict lighting control was implemented. Inspection teams and guidance teams composed of military police and Baojia personnel inspected all districts, streets, lanes, and alleys in the city and provided guidance and correction for those with poor lighting control. Violators were punished according to the rules, and a joint liability system was adopted, with even one Bao or even one Lianbao being subject to power outages. Vehicles with poor lighting were also subject to penalties, and both the person and the bureau were punished. In addition, the special protection corps of various factories and buildings also implemented various comprehensive air defense trainings under the guidance of personnel dispatched by the Air Defense Headquarters and the respective branch offices.

### District Exercises
Under the guidance of the Air Defense Headquarters, comprehensive training was conducted in northern Sichuan, mobilizing all personnel from the fire department, rescue team, police headquarters' fourth team, White Russian air defense squad, etc. The policemen of the Hongkou branch office, members of the Chinese and Japanese self-defense corps of the naval garrison area, and work crews from the electric company, water company, telephone company, and gas company also participated in the training. First, a simulated enemy air raid was carried out to implement shelter training. At the same time, it was simulated that water, electricity, telephone, and gas were damaged, and work crews from each company were dispatched to repair them. Police and security personnel arrived at the scene to rescue, the White Russian air defense squad sought the remains from the bricks, and police officers prepared to collect corpses and set up a shelter to accommodate the families of the dead and wounded.

The old district held a large-scale comprehensive training at the intersection of Nanjing Road and Liuhe Road at 4:00 p.m. yesterday. The Huashan district implemented a large-scale training at the intersection of Singapore Road and Kangding Road at 2:30 p.m. yesterday, with all police and security personnel participating.

Each branch office organized a police bicycle relay team to maintain close contact with the General Bureau (Air Defense Section) to relay alarms and police orders. Each air defense district organized a Baojia self-defense corps bicycle relay team to maintain close contact with each branch office to relay alarms and police orders, so that alarms or police orders could be transmitted to all districts in the city in the fastest time possible, and the results were good.

### Money Shops Raise Interest Rates
In order to maintain business operations, the banks and money shops in the city have successively raised the interest rates for various legal mortgage loans to 2.4 to 3%. Interest rates on loans related to industrial and commercial production have been reduced to 1.8%, and the highest rate must not exceed 2%. As for secret interest rates of 4 to 5% or more, this is sufficient to disrupt the financial system and encourage speculative activities. The relevant financial authorities have already paid close attention to this and are determined to crack down on it.

### Free Admission for Children of Postal Workers
The Municipal Postal Administration believes that postal workers serve the country and live a hard life. It sent a letter to the Education Bureau requesting that the children of postal workers be given free preferential treatment for admission to schools, in accordance with the measures for the children of civil servants. The Education Bureau immediately forwarded the request to the Municipal Government, and it is reported that it has been approved.

### Police Crackdown on Unauthorized Private Transportation of Cash; Amounts Under 1 Million Yuan Can Be Freely Carried
The Municipal Government authorities, after checking the provisions of Article 2 of the Regulations on the Transportation of Cash, determined that it had been revised by the Ministry of Finance: "Anyone transporting legal tender from the interior to Shanghai or transporting legal tender to and from domestic ports in amounts exceeding 1 million yuan should submit the type, amount, purpose, number of boxes loaded, and place of departure to the Ministry of Finance for approval and issuance of a passport before transportation can begin. If transportation begins without a permit and is seized by the customs, it should be confiscated in its entirety." The Ministry of Finance requested cooperation in cracking down on unauthorized and illegal transportation and ordered the police department to instruct the duty police at the North and South stations and wharves to strictly crack down on passengers carrying more than 1 million yuan in cash without a passport from the Ministry of Finance (amounts under 1 million yuan can be freely carried) or carrying cash in excess of the amount stated on the passport. However, it was found that many passengers on public buses traveling on highways also had private cash with them, and they should also be inspected and cracked down on. Therefore, Mayor Zhou, concurrently the head of the police department, reiterated the previous order and instructed each branch office to send additional police officers to strictly inspect and crack down on public buses traveling on highways to enforce the law.

### Central China Revitalization Company Donates to Disaster Relief
Japanese people in Shanghai are extremely concerned about the victims of air raids. Under the leadership of President Takashima and Vice President Tomono of the Central China Revitalization Company, the company, together with its affiliated companies, decided to jointly donate 20 million yuan, of which 10 million yuan will be used by the company to purchase affordable medical supplies, which will be delivered to the Municipal Welfare Association together with the cash of 10 million yuan within a few days for disaster relief. The president said that in the future, the company can provide a special and full supply of water, electricity, and gas to all hospitals and emergency organizations as needed for disaster relief, without being subject to general restrictions. At the same time, the company plans to provide all transportation vehicles owned by its affiliated companies for air raid relief as possible when necessary. In addition, important Japanese business leaders, such as Mr. Kawamura, the branch manager of the Yokohama Specie Bank, are also scheduled to gather today to discuss fundraising methods for air raid relief, and a large sum of money will be donated within a few days for relief purposes. In addition, the Japanese Dobun Shoin donated 10 million yuan, and all teachers and students of the college also jointly donated 141,000 yuan.

### Jinggu Hotel Fined for Underreporting Special Taxes
