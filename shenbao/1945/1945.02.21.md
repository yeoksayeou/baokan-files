### Intense Battles on Iwo Jima: Japanese Garrison Inflicts Heavy Artillery Fire, Causing 3,500 Enemy Casualties

Tokyo, 20th (Central News Agency) – Imperial Headquarters announced at 3:00 PM on the 20th: Enemy forces began landing on Iwo Jima on the morning of the 19th. The Japanese garrison on the island is currently engaging in fierce counterattacks.

Tokyo, 20th (Central News Agency) – Enemy forces around Iwo Jima, at 6:20 AM on the 19th, approached the southern waters of the island with over 50 large transport ships. By 6:50 AM, approximately 300 landing craft had formed a landing posture in the waters near the coast. Around 8:00 AM, the landing craft were divided into three waves, commencing a forceful landing on the beaches of Nigenhama. The Japanese garrison immediately launched a fierce attack. Heavy artillery and heavy and light machine guns from Mount Suribachi and the southern landing areas bombarded the landing forces from both east and west, inflicting heavy damage on the enemy. However, the enemy forces continued their forceful landing, and by noon that day, they had landed with 150 tanks and 4,000 troops. A vanguard unit had already reached the southwestern end of Chidori Airfield. As of noon on the 19th, Japanese forces had destroyed or burned 10 enemy landing craft, stranded over 30 tanks, and killed over 2,000 enemy soldiers, inflicting significant damage on the enemy's first line of defense. Fierce fighting is ongoing.

Tokyo, 20th (Central News Agency) – As of the afternoon of the 19th, the enemy American landing forces on Iwo Jima, with a powerful unit carrying tanks, launched an offensive against the Japanese positions on Mount Suribachi in the southwestern part of the island. Simultaneously, their main force applied pressure to the southeastern side of the central part of the island towards the Ogasawara area. Subsequently, the enemy further increased their forces, deploying approximately 150 additional landing tanks. By 9:00 PM, the enemy's bridgehead extended from north of Minamibitou to the southern part of the airfield, covering a frontage of three kilometers and a depth of 300-400 meters. Furthermore, the enemy attempted to land troops on the southeastern corner and eastern coast during the night, against which the Japanese forces are launching fierce counterattacks.

The Great Battle on the Volcanic Island is More Intense Than Any Previous Engagement

Tokyo, 20th (Central News Agency) – The enemy American naval task force landing on Iwo Jima ordered its main force to advance towards the front of Chidori Airfield on the western corner of the island's southern shore. By 8:00 PM on the 19th, the enemy had deployed 10,000 troops and approximately 200 amphibious tanks in their attack on this area. At that time, the Japanese units positioned on Mount Suribachi on the western end of the island and the high ground in front of the southern landing area immediately engaged the enemy. By this evening, they had inflicted 3,500 casualties on the enemy, and the expansion of their gains continues. Iwo Jima is a typical volcanic island. Because the island's coastline consists of increasingly steep terraced cliffs, the enemy landing forces, despite spending twelve hours, have only managed to establish a bridgehead 300 to 700 meters deep. The enemy forces, crowded into a three-kilometer front, are now concentrating a large force and engaging in fierce combat to expand their bridgehead. However, in such dense fighting with limited space and numerous troops, they can only suffer damage. Before the landing, the enemy conducted approximately sixty consecutive bombing runs, along with intense naval bombardment, but the Japanese positions suffered little damage. The enemy exerted one hundred percent of their strength during the landing. In conclusion, the enemy's bloodshed in this operation is extensive, making it more intense than any previous engagement.

Enemy Warships Retreat to Forty Kilometers

Tokyo, 20th (Central News Agency) – The enemy fleet off Iwo Jima, which includes numerous aircraft carriers and battleships, possesses a considerable naval force. These ships not only conduct landing operations under the cover of carrier-based aircraft throughout the day, but some of them also bombard the coast from about ten kilometers away throughout the night. The warships retreat to a distance of forty kilometers and constantly change position to guard against Japanese surprise attacks. Furthermore, enemy reconnaissance planes have been using clear code for communication with ships or ground forces for several weeks, which indicates that the enemy feels a sense of urgency due to the fierce Japanese counterattacks.

### Expanded Gains by Japanese Forces on Ramree Island

Burma Front, 20th (Central News Agency) – Since the enemy landed in Kyaukpyu on January 21st, Japanese forces on Ramree Island have launched separate surprise attacks, inflicting significant losses on the enemy. On the 8th of this month, under the cover of ten tanks, the enemy attempted to break through the Japanese land defenses on the high ground outside of Ramree city. They engaged in fierce fighting with Japanese forces. On the 9th, Japanese forces launched a counteroffensive, inflicting over 400 casualties on the enemy, and the gains are still expanding.

Burma, 19th (Central News Agency) – On the 17th, the Japanese air combat units in Burma searched for and attacked enemy units near Pakhoku. Four enemy armored vehicles were hit and caught fire. In addition, sixty vehicles were destroyed. They also engaged enemy light transport planes that attempted to intercept them, shooting down one P-38 each. They further attacked enemy fortresses and destroyed them. All Japanese aircraft returned to base.

### Change of Commander at Ominato Naval Base

Tokyo, 20th (Central News Agency) – The Japanese Navy Ministry announced on February 19th: Rear Admiral Eiji Goto has been appointed as Commander of the Ominato Naval Base. The previous commander, Vice Admiral Yasuo Inoue, has been transferred to the Naval General Staff.

### Fierce Air Battle Near Tokyo Yesterday: Twenty-One B-29s Shot Down

Tokyo, 20th (Central News Agency) – The Imperial Headquarters announced at 3:00 PM on the 20th that the results of the counterattack against the enemy B-29 raid near Tokyo on the 19th have been confirmed as follows (including those already announced): Twenty-one aircraft shot down (including two that collided and crashed), four self-destructed or did not return.

Tokyo, 20th (Central News Agency) – Regarding the raid of approximately one hundred enemy B-29s near Tokyo on the afternoon of the 19th, the results of the Japanese aircraft's counterattack were confirmed as ten aircraft shot down as of 4:00 PM this afternoon. However, after further investigation, an additional eleven aircraft were confirmed, bringing the total to twenty-one enemy aircraft shot down. In addition, several were damaged. To avoid double counting, the announced figures are always based on the minimum. In summary, the number of aircraft shot down and destroyed amounts to half of the attacking enemy aircraft. The air battle that day was exceptionally fierce, and the enemy's bombing targets were not reached. They only damaged transportation routes in various parts of the city and engaged in indiscriminate bombing before fleeing.

Tokyo, 19th (Central News Agency) – After the enemy mobile force's carrier-based aircraft first attacked the Kanto and Shizuoka areas on the 16th and 17th, approximately one hundred B-29 enemy aircraft from the Mariana Islands invaded the Japanese mainland in large formations on the afternoon of the 19th. The main force of ninety aircraft, divided into nine formations, attacked Tokyo and the surrounding areas from around 2:50 PM to 3:41 PM. The Japanese air defense forces had already achieved brilliant results in intercepting the enemy carrier-based aircraft, so their morale was even higher. At that time, the air and ground forces united and launched a fierce counterattack. By 4:00 PM, the confirmed results of the shooting down had exceeded ten aircraft. Including the reports that have not yet been received, the actual results were considerable. Therefore, the enemy formations became disorganized before they even penetrated the Tokyo area. Their dropped bombs also lacked accurate targets and were dropped indiscriminately in various locations inside and outside Tokyo. Therefore, the Japanese ground losses were minimal. Also, a part of the enemy aircraft attempted to [unclear] the iron bridges and bridges of [unclear] Prefecture, but also [unclear] succeeded.

### Statement by Southern Japanese Naval Authorities

Makassar, 20th (Central News Agency) – The Japanese naval authorities, which govern the regions of Celebes, South Borneo, and the Lesser Sunda Islands, are actively promoting the realization of the East Indies independence treaty. They have recently announced the revision of the Provisional State Assembly Ordinance, the Provisional City Assembly Ordinance, and the Provisional Special Employment Ordinance for Indigenous People, which will be implemented immediately. The local Japanese naval authorities also issued a statement as follows: The authorities have decided to expand the political participation of the nation's training policy, increasing the number of assembly members in substance, relaxing qualification restrictions, and employing indigenous personnel. In the past, those who had not obtained qualifications under the Provisional Employment Ordinance for Indigenous Personnel could now be specially employed.

### Xinchang Town in Nanhui County

— Yifei

On January 27th, the reporter took a steamboat from Zhoupu to Xinchang for investigation. The boat was very small, accommodating only thirty or forty passengers. The crowded conditions were indescribable. It departed at 8:00 AM and arrived at Xinchang Town in about two hours.

Population and Farmland: Xinchang is the third largest town in Nanhui County, serving as the seventh administrative district. The entire district administratively comprises three towns and eight villages, with a total population of 45,019 people. The population density of each town and village is as follows: (1) Xinchang Town: 8,831 people; (2) Tanzhi Town: 4,603 people; (3) Sanzao Town: 3,894 people; (4) Zhangqiao Village: 5,069 people; (5) Yongqing Village: 4,740 people; (6) Zhongxin Village: 3,925 people; (7) Liansan Village: 3,198 people; (8) Tandong Village: 2,602 people; (9) Qizao Village: 2,754 people; (10) Xinnan Village: 2,984 people; (11) Tanbei Village: 2,436 people. The classification of people's occupations is as follows: (1) Farmers account for 35.2%; (2) Merchants account for 21.5%; (3) Civil servants account for 1.4%; (4) The academic community accounts for 3.21%; (5) The medical community accounts for 1.4%; (6) Workers account for 18.1%; (7) Other occupations account for 19.2%.

The entire district has 123,588 mu of farmland (according to a recent survey of actual land tax revenue). This area belongs to the western part of Nanhui County, so its farmland system is based on "tu fen" (map division), which differs from the "tuan fen" (group division) system of the eastern part of the county. The relationship between landowners and tenant farmers also differs from that in the eastern part. In the eastern part, most land is "tian tian" (rented land), and tenants must first pay a rental price before they can cultivate the land. However, here, the "zhao zu" (summon rent) method is used, where tenants cultivate the land first and then pay the rent. However, there is a traditional custom for tenants to pay a "ding shou" (top hand), or deposit rent, of 10,000 yuan per mu to the landowner. This is an old regulation from earlier years. Based on the current cost of living index, it seems likely that this has increased. However, since most large landowners reside in cities, they have difficulty managing their farmland in the countryside. Therefore, in recent years, landowners are fortunate to receive this amount, let alone increase the "top hand." Currently, a tenant family of five in this area needs to cultivate at least ten mu of land to maintain their livelihood. Otherwise, those with three to five mu will inevitably face economic difficulties and struggle to make ends meet. Therefore, in the Xinchang area, with limited farmland and the increasing living expenses of tenant farmers, there is a need for more rented land, resulting in a situation where there is not enough to go around, and the distribution of farmland is insufficient. As for the rent price, due to environmental factors, the ownership of farmland tends towards the tenants, with a tendency for the guest to usurp the host, and it is often not easy for landowners to change this situation. Currently, there are two types of rent prices in this area: in towns and villages such as Tanzhi, Tandong, Tanbei, Sanzao, and Liansan, it is around 7,000-8,000 yuan per mu; while in Yongqing Zhongxin, Xinnan Zhang, Qizao, and Xinchang, it is around 6,000 yuan per mu. The main agricultural product is cotton, accounting for 60% of the total agricultural output, followed by rice, accounting for about 30%, and then beans, accounting for 5%. (Note: Xinchang produces a type of black soybean, commonly known as "cow tread flat beans," which is very nutritious. However, the production is too small, and most villagers keep it for their own use, so it is not easy to buy in the market.)

City Appearance and Transportation: Although Xinchang's city appearance is slightly inferior to Zhoupu and Datuan, it is much more lively than the county seat of Nanhui, and the cleanliness of the streets is incomparable. The essence of Xinchang Town is concentrated in South Street and the Baogiao Bridge area, where flower shops and grain stores line both banks of the Baogiao River, serving as the distribution center for the town's major trade in flowers and rice. Tea houses and restaurants are mostly concentrated in the Hongfu Bridge area.

Transportation in Xinchang is quite developed. In addition to civilian ships, there are also highway buses and inland river steamboats, with frequent daily trips. Its trade and transportation network extends east to Datuan, west to Zhangang, south to Fengxian, and north to Zhoupu. The distance between these four places and Xinchang is all 24 li, which is also a coincidence.

Educational Situation: Most of Xinchang's educational institutions were destroyed in the incident. Currently, the Xincheng Elementary School is the most well-established primary school. It has 737 students, 18 teachers, and 13 classrooms. The facilities are quite simple, and the doors, windows, and floors of several rooms are incomplete. According to Principal Yan, this was due to local ruffians taking advantage of the fire to loot after the war. Although repairs are being made gradually, the limited funding has necessitated a secondary solution, which is to gradually move mud and soil to raise the ground of the classrooms and then try to flatten it for use during student work time.

There is only one middle school, Leyu Middle School. This school is very small, with only 78 students divided into three classrooms. The principal is Wu Luping. Before the incident, the school was originally the site of the Daming Girls' School, but after the incident, it was temporarily converted into the Xinchang Elementary School. The school is located in the southwest corner of Xinchang Town, surrounded by farmland, and the courtyard is quite spacious. Therefore, it was once coveted by profit-seeking merchants who planned to invest in purchasing it and converting it into a small textile factory. However, this was opposed by gentlemen with a passion for education, and the matter was dropped.

### Broadcast by Mr. Iguchi, Chief of the Japanese Information Bureau

Tokyo, 20th (Central News Agency) – Mr. Iguchi, the third chief of the Japanese Information Bureau, broadcasted a message to various regions on the afternoon of the 19th at 3:20 PM, titled "Regarding the American Situation in Invading the Philippines." Comparing Japan's war aims of establishing international justice and liberating East Asia with the United States' ambition of dominating the world based on imperialism, he pointed out that the United States' war power should not be underestimated. He then listed the United States' vulnerabilities: (1) lack of human resources, forcing them to violate public sentiment and propose a National Conscription Act; (2) increasing difficulty in supply; (3) difficult national life. He urged the people to approach the path to final victory with a calm and knowledgeable attitude.

### People in the Chongqing Area Yearn for Peace

Hankou, 20th (Central News Agency) – The Chongqing regime has betrayed East Asia and willingly become a slave of the enemy, Britain and the United States. Recently, they have strengthened cooperation with Britain and the United States and are preparing for a general offensive on the mainland. However, the general public is gradually recognizing the new situation in East Asia. Especially recently, with the increasing oppression from Britain and the United States, they are becoming more skeptical of Chongqing's resistance. Among young students and the intellectual class, the desire for peace is extremely strong. According to a survey of the sentiments of the people in the resistance areas in November of last year, the first thing they did was complain about their hardships. Those in poverty accounted for more than half of the total. The second most common sentiment was the yearning for peace, which was expressed by a strong two-thirds of those who advocated resistance. The number of those who were pessimistic about the future of the resistance was equal to the number of those who were optimistic. The most common desire was to relocate to peaceful areas. Among those who yearned for peace, the first occupational category was students, followed by workers and peasants, third was military personnel, scholars, fourth was merchants, and fifth was civil servants and others. The fact that students seem to be the most desirous of peace is a phenomenon that has occurred for the first time since the incident. The student class, which stood at the forefront of the people and incited resistance at the beginning of the incident, has undergone such a major transformation, which is quite noteworthy. Furthermore, the fact that peasants who have suffered the baptism of war desire peace and rank military personnel and scholars after them reveals their fatigue with the war. The fact that civil servants and merchants are ranked last reveals the true situation of corrupt officials and treacherous merchants. The scoundrels of Chongqing can be said to belong to this class of officials and merchants. In summary, the people in the resistance areas yearn for peace more than expected, especially the student class among the intellectual class. The rise of the peace movement is extremely important for the future trends in the resistance areas.

The Japanese commander, while bravely killing the enemy, telegraphed the country, stating that they are confident of victory and vow to fight to the death to destroy the enemy Americans. Their fighting spirit is extremely high.

Editorial

### Manpower, Financial Resources, and Time

Since the reorganization of the Shanghai Municipal Government on the 15th of last month, only a month has passed, yet various superficial reforms have already yielded significant results. Recently, this newspaper has specially opened a "Shanghai Municipal Affairs" column, collecting and publishing opinions from all sectors of society in a comprehensive manner. The first issue was released on the 10th of this month and included an article by Secretary-General Luo titled "The Future of Shanghai Municipal Affairs," which contained comprehensive wording and profound meaning, looking both forward and backward in a truly pertinent manner. At the end of the article, there was a strong concluding emphasis on "hoping that the citizens of Shanghai, regardless of nationality or class, will cooperate sincerely with the Municipal Government authorities to jointly seek reasonable and legal improvement and development of Shanghai's municipal affairs." This demonstrates the grand ambitions of the new municipal authorities, who are not satisfied with piecemeal, superficial progress but seek further systematic and thorough transformation, with "reasonableness and legality" as the ultimate goal. This aligns with the expectations of all the city's citizens and the appeals of general public opinion (see this newspaper's editorial on the 31st of last month). It is sincerely hoped that all parties will express their views as much as possible, and at the same time, it is hoped that the Municipal Affairs Standing Committee will widely collect contributions, leaving no good ideas unconsidered, and compile fragmentary contributions into an organized plan. In addition, it is hoped that the municipal authorities will pay attention to the three major elements for promoting the success of undertakings - manpower, financial resources, and time - so that all plans will not remain mere empty talk on paper, and the great cause of transforming Shanghai can be completed as soon as possible. I would like to discuss these three points:

(1) The parallel nature of manpower, financial resources, and time: There are laws but no one to obey them, there is work but no one to promote it. Any organization, no matter how large, has very little efficiency in any of its departments. They cannot show their due achievements or reach their due progress. All kinds of phenomena are enough to prove that there are people but no power, many people but weak abilities, emphasizing quantity over quality, which is the biggest flaw in manpower in terms of undertaking. Either the houses are narrow and cramped, or the equipment is simple and crude. Any agency has huge expenses, but any agency still makes do with simplicity. The budget and final accounting system is often unsound, and even if there is a prototype, it is not strictly followed. Expenses for business, technology, and other aspects are often not allocated in a reasonable manner. Those who are cautious know how to measure income and expenditure but do not know how to increase revenue and reduce expenditure, and do not seek merit but only seek no mistakes. Those who are arrogant do not distinguish between public and private matters and squander at will. Household servants and maids are all listed in the organization's roster, and firewood, charcoal, and tea are also listed as public expenses, or even use public funds to make profits or use public funds to purchase property, and then forge accounts to cover up. All kinds of phenomena are enough to express poverty and embarrassment, because the funds are not only small but also used improperly, so that all the wealth cannot exert its due power, which is a defect in financial resources in terms of undertaking. Reading newspapers, drinking tea, and chatting are common habits of middle and lower-level personnel. Drafting documents, signing approvals, attending meetings, and socializing are the daily work of management personnel. Coupled with the slowness of official correspondence and the cumbersome procedures, even if it is not shelved, it is enough to waste time and energy. Furthermore, they like to talk about strategy on paper but do not focus on practice, so year after year there is nothing worth mentioning. In addition, frequent transfers and complete changes of personnel make it impossible to warm the seats, let alone talk about political achievements. This is a defect in the efficiency of time in terms of undertaking.

(2) The Chain-like Nature of Manpower, Financial Resources, and Time: If the manpower is excellent, then it will surely generate wealth, and every drop will be given to the public. The urgency and importance of expenditures will be rationally coordinated, so that financial resources can be fully utilized. It will also cherish every inch of time and make full use of it, with energetic spirit and intensive work, so that the efficiency of time can be fully utilized. If the financial resources are abundant, then the treatment will be generous, the life will be stable, and they will be urged to be diligent and encouraged by honor and disgrace, so that manpower can be fully utilized. It is also necessary to have sophisticated equipment and complete tools, so that what can be done by others in a hundred days, I can do in ten days, and what can be done by others in ten days, I can do in one day, so that the efficiency of time can be fully utilized. If time can be fully utilized, then the work of a hundred people can be done by ten people, and the work of ten people can be done by one person, so that manpower can be fully utilized. What can be done in a hundred years can be done in ten years, and what can be done in ten years can be done in one year. This can not only reduce passive expenses but also increase active production, reduce leaks and open up sources, so that financial resources can be fully utilized.

Expressing opinions and contributing ideas is the duty of every citizen to assist and support, while how to use manpower, financial resources, and time, how to economize, and how to make them generate great power independently or interdependently to shoulder the mission of transforming Shanghai is the responsibility of the municipal authorities. If citizens and municipal authorities each work hard in their respective positions and cooperate sincerely, then the reasonable and legal progress of Shanghai's municipal affairs can be expected soon!

### The Economic Bureau Announces the Implementation of Price Limits for Major Commodities, Hoping that All Industries, Businesses, and Citizens Will Strictly Abide By Them

The city's Economic Bureau, due to the sudden and sharp rise in general commodity prices in the city, repeatedly requested instructions from the Central Government on emergency suppression measures. As a result of consultations between the Central Government and the Yuekai authorities, it was decided to gradually implement price suppression for general commodities and take strict measures to first assess the latest price limits for sixteen major commodities on the sixteenth to stabilize people's livelihood. After receiving the order, the bureau immediately summoned representatives of all industry associations in the city at the Municipal Chamber of Commerce on the thirtieth day of the Lunar New Year to hold an emergency discussion meeting, declaring the Central Government's determination to suppress commodity prices and first issuing the sixteen major commodities. The bureau ordered each association to submit the selling price and cost of each item on February 5 to the bureau. At the same time, in order to strengthen the internal organization of the Commodity Price Appraisal Council, in addition to re-adjusting the original council members, they also hired economic authorities such as Li Quanshi as specialized members. At the same time, the city government hired former business leaders Wen Lanting, Yuan Ludeng, and Lin Kanghou as appraisal members to participate in commodity price appraisal to show prudence. After the internal lineup was strengthened, a joint meeting of council members and specialized members was convened on the sixteenth to review the selling price and cost figures submitted by each association in detail. On the eighteenth, a meeting of the Appraisal Committee was convened to make a final decision on the prices determined by the joint meeting, summoning representatives of each industry to order them to abide by them, and announced their implementation yesterday (20th). At the same time, the bureau will convene a meeting of relevant parties and representatives of each industry association of major commodities at the bureau at 2:00 p.m. today (21st) to report on the process of assessing the price limits for the sixteen commodities this time, and deeply hopes that all industries, businesses, and citizens will strictly abide by the verified prices and not raise them arbitrarily. It also requests economic police and other authorities to assist in supervising the implementation.

Special Thanks to All Sectors of Society for Their Enthusiastic Support

The "Special Fundraising Team" organized by this newspaper to raise funds for the 8th Readers' Scholarship Fund was announced to be concluded at 5:00 p.m. yesterday. In advance, we hoped that the donations would be particularly enthusiastic on this last day to show the meaning of "successful completion". Sure enough, as expected, the good news came that the receipts exceeded 5.6 million yuan, setting a new record never seen before, which made us feel exceptionally excited. On the one hand, we are grateful to the teachers and students of 35 universities and middle schools in Shanghai for their joint efforts to organize the charity bazaar jointly organized by Shenbao and Xinbao and the two male and female youth associations, and for their tireless efforts to solicit donations and sell consignment coupons, with extraordinary results. Although the accounts have not been settled, 5 million yuan has been allocated in advance for application. On the other hand, we are grateful to the Kugian Drama Troupe for the charity performance of "Begonia" for Shenbao and Xinbao. We often accept people from all walks of life to purchase honor seat coupons. After deducting expenses, each newspaper received more than 530,000 yuan, which is even more considerable when combined with the figures from other teams. Looking back on the "Special Fundraising" from beginning to end, which lasted for 80 days, the original target was 1,000 teams and 20 million yuan. Now the number of teams is only more than 500, but the donations have exceeded the budget, with more than 8 million yuan in additional receipts, which can be said to be a successful completion and a pleasant surprise. The colleagues of this newspaper, on behalf of 5,000 poor students, extend their heartfelt gratitude to all the enthusiastic gentlemen from all walks of life!

Congratulations on the New Year, Frugality and Scholarship Assistance. Mr. Hu Zuyin and Mao Xinyi wrote: "Dear Sir, I read in your newspaper that Mr. Ying Yongyu initiated the establishment of the "Congratulations on the New Year, Frugality and Scholarship Assistance Team", saving expenses, helping out-of-school children, and benefiting relatives and friends. The method is good and the intention is kind. Mr. Ying also donated first to promote it, which is admirable. In response, we specially send the New Year's funds to be included in the "Congratulations on the New Year, Frugality and Scholarship Assistance Team", and wish our relatives and friends a happy New Year. We hope that everyone will respond together and achieve the cause of righteousness."

Collecting One-Yuan Tickets Was a Pleasant Surprise. Colleagues from Dao Heng Fulong wrote: "Dear Sir, I previously read in your newspaper about the scholarship movement that there was a move to collect one-yuan tickets. Colleagues and others responded by setting up boxes according to the method to collect them. Unexpectedly, when the boxes were opened for inspection, the tickets that were thrown in were mostly not one-yuan tickets, and some assisted with thousands and hundreds of yuan. Now, the collected funds are put together to make 10,000 yuan and sent over. I hope you will check and accept it.

Chengye Middle School Enthusiastically Solicits Donations Chengye Middle School wrote: "Dear Sir, The teachers and students of our school believe that the large number of out-of-school people in recent years is by no means the fortune of the country. In the first semester, we mobilized all the students in the school to form a savings scholarship team, encouraging students to cultivate the style of thrift and righteousness. After half a year of saving every penny, we have accumulated a total of 40,683.8 yuan. In addition to donating 30,000 yuan to Shenbao for the first time to form a team, the remaining 10,683.8 yuan was donated to Xinwenbao to form a team. Also, at the end of last year, we launched a special fundraising team. Through the efforts of all the teachers and students, we raised a total of 65,605 yuan. In addition to donating 5,605 yuan to the Jinshan Shanghai Fellow Association Scholarship Fund, the remaining 60,000 yuan was divided into 40,000 yuan for Shenbao to form a team, and 20,000 yuan for Xinwenbao to form a team. Although the two scholarship movements in our school in the first semester are only a small amount, they are used to promote the spirit of Shangyi. For the savings scholarship movement, we will continue to promote it this semester. Please publish it to commend it and promote it, and hope that each school will follow suit to cultivate students' virtues of thrift and righteousness."

### Impersonating Military Police Secret Agents, Hoping Citizens Will Report Them, Japanese Military Police Authorities Issue Statement

The Shanghai Japanese Military Police authorities issued the following statement yesterday regarding the investigation of impersonating secret agents:

Sino-Japanese cooperation is the fundamental policy of Japan towards China. The Japanese military police are afraid that they are not taking care of the Chinese people adequately. They sincerely protect the general good people. However, recently, there have been people who have no relationship with the military police, impersonating the name of the military police, coercing good people, or extorting money, causing the general people to misunderstand the military police. It is extremely regrettable. Previously, a Chinese man named Zhao colluded with several friends and falsely claimed to be a military police secret agent. He set up an office in a certain hotel and illegally imprisoned good people to extort money. Fortunately, there was a secret report and investigation revealed that those people had no relationship with the military police and were immediately severely punished. However, many people have been harmed by them. It has been published several times in the past that the military police will never send Chinese people to detain Chinese people, or take them to the military police for investigation. If necessary, when taking people to the team, the military police must go in person, and after showing their identification, they will deal with it. Therefore, in the future, if any suspicious people are found, it is hoped that citizens will immediately report them secretly. The names of the informants will be kept absolutely confidential. Even if there is any disadvantage to the informants in the future, the military police will protect them. In addition, in order to protect the law-abiding citizens, the military police will adopt a policy of severe punishment for such illegal acts, regardless of their nationality. It is hoped that the citizens will understand the true intentions of the military police and report as much as possible to eliminate such people who impersonate secret agents. It is also deeply related to the welfare of the citizens.
