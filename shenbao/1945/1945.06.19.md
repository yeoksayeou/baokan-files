### Japanese Forces in Southern Okinawa Dig Deep Defensive Positions in Shiri Area; Air Force Launches Another Surprise Attack on Enemy Airfield

Tokyo, 18th (Central News Agency) – Japanese forces in the Shiri area of southern Okinawa Island are constructing deep defensive positions in the hilly areas of Gushichan, Tomigusuku, Yonagusuku, and Itoman. Morale is high, and they continue to fight valiantly. The enemy forces, having received reinforcements and reorganized, with the 7th, 9th, 16th, and Naval 1st Divisions, repeatedly launch fierce attacks on the front lines, attempting to break through the Japanese defensive positions head-on from Gushichan and Tomigusuku, hoping to decisively determine the outcome of the battle. The fighting in this area is extremely fierce. Since the Japanese forces' core defensive area on Okinawa Island, the area around Shuri and Naha, began to experience fierce battles at the end of May, two weeks have passed. The Japanese garrison, in an orderly state, fights bravely, causing the enemy's casualties to increase daily. From the beginning of June to the 10th, they have inflicted over 20,000 casualties on the enemy. Counting from the enemy's landing, the total number of casualties has reached over 73,500. The Japanese forces' indomitable counter-attacks have truly exceeded the enemy's expectations. As a result, enemy naval vessels have begun to provide covering fire and bombing again. Under these extremely fierce combat conditions, the Japanese garrison is further demonstrating its inherent spirit, preventing the enemy from shifting to the next phase of their operation. At the same time, the Japanese forces in the Oroku area, though surrounded by the enemy's 6th Marine Division, are still engaging in hand-to-hand combat, charging into enemy lines and causing the enemy soldiers to tremble with fear.

Ryukyu Islands Base, 18th (Central News Agency) – The Japanese air force launched a surprise attack on the enemy airfield on Okinawa Island on the morning of the 17th, dropping bombs with precision, causing explosions and fires in several locations. Over the past few days, in support of the land operations, the enemy has been using cruisers and other small vessels to bombard the Japanese positions on the southern tip of Okinawa Island. Also, on the 17th, about 200 enemy aircraft attacked the Ryukyu Islands.

### Japanese Army Authorities Print and Distribute Combat Guidelines for Anti-Airborne Units

Tokyo, 18th (Central News Agency) – The Japanese Army Ministry's Directorate General of Education, anticipating that if the homeland becomes a decisive battleground, the enemy forces will inevitably use transport planes to forcibly land airborne troops carrying personnel and weapons, has printed and distributed concise pamphlets outlining combat guidelines for anti-airborne units to the Japanese military and national volunteer corps throughout the country.

Tokyo, 18th (Central News Agency) – Since the enemy forces began their invasion operations in the Pacific, starting with the landing operations on Guadalcanal and ultimately progressing to the Okinawa operation, they have suffered heavy losses, setting an unprecedented record in military history. Currently, having temporarily achieved their operational objectives, the enemy seems to be optimistic about landing operations on the Japanese mainland. However, the current Okinawa operation has completely shattered the enemy's optimistic views. The enemy's disadvantages are as follows: Their fleet of warships has suffered heavy losses, with over one-third of their naval strength destroyed by Japanese forces, and about one-half of their basic naval strength is in an unusable state. Therefore, when the enemy launches their usual landing operations, it will be difficult for them to quickly gain absolute superiority of local air power in the current Okinawa operation. Furthermore, in the next phase of operations, they will have to rely heavily on base air forces to replace aircraft carriers for air power operations, which will also face considerable threats. As a result, the American military is implementing an unprecedented air attack strategy based on base air forces, adopting strong aerial combat tactics. At the same time, the Okinawa operation has also given Japan the confidence to annihilate the enemy's landing attempts on the mainland. Moreover, the enemy forces in the Okinawa operation have experienced the power of the Japanese special attack units and suffered considerable blows. Unless they can devise effective countermeasures to stop such Japanese special attack tactics, their mobile units will have no possibility of advancing. The power of the Japanese forces in the Okinawa operation has not only made the enemy extremely cautious about landing operations on the Japanese mainland, but also strengthened our belief that Japan can achieve final victory.

### Residents of Sumatra Join Special Attack Units

Sumatra Base, 18th (Central News Agency) – The magnificent and heroic spirit of the Japanese special attack units has deeply impressed the minds of the residents of Sumatra. Whenever the word "special attack" appears during film screenings, the entire audience spontaneously stands up to express their gratitude and their desire to build Sumatra. The local youth are greatly inspired, and recently, many have volunteered to join the Sumatra special attack units. The number of volunteers submitting applications to the volunteer army and the volunteer army support units continues to increase, now reaching over one thousand.

### Central and Military Affairs Commission Hold Commemorative Week

Nanjing, 18th (Central News Agency) – The Central Party Headquarters held the 254th Dr. Sun Yat-sen Memorial Week at 10:00 AM in the headquarters' auditorium. Members of the Central Executive and Supervisory Committees, along with working comrades from various departments and bureaus, and Kuomintang members from government agencies, totaling over 600 people, attended. Vice Secretary-General Dai Ze presided over the ceremony. Committee member Zhou Huarin reported on "Understanding Communism," which lasted one hour and was very detailed. The ceremony concluded at approximately 11:00 AM.

Nanjing, 18th (Central News Agency) – The Military Affairs Commission and the General Staff held a commemorative ceremony at 9:00 AM. General Yang Zhen served as chairman, leading all staff members in the ceremony, which lasted half an hour before adjourning.

### Funeral of Japanese Prince Nashimoto-no-miya Yesterday

Tokyo, 18th (Central News Agency) – The state funeral of the late Field Marshal of the Army, Prince Nashimoto-no-miya, was solemnly held at the Toyoshimaoka Cemetery on the morning of the 18th. Imperial envoys were dispatched, and representatives from the Empress Dowager's and Empress's households attended the funeral, adding to the solemnity of the occasion.

### People's Training Department Promotes Work

Nanjing, 18th (Central News Agency) – The People's Training Department of the Central Executive Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang was formally established some time ago. Specific plans for promoting the New Life Movement are now being actively carried out and will soon be launched. Deputy Minister Wang convened a meeting of the directors of various sections on the 18th to discuss the direction of the promotion efforts.

### Yomiuri Shimbun Discusses Chongqing-Communist Friction

Tokyo, 18th (Central News Agency) – The local Yomiuri Shimbun, under the title "Intensifying Chongqing-Communist Armed Conflict," published the following commentary: Recent noteworthy developments in the Chongqing area include the activity of the American-equipped Chongqing troops in Yunnan and South China, and the active armed struggle of the National Communist Army against the Chongqing troops. The equipment and command of the former are all American-style; therefore, rather than considering it an independent action of the Chongqing troops, it is more accurate to say that they are acting under American control. When the United States discovered that Yan'an was taking an aggressive stance against Chongqing, it responded to Chongqing's appeals by declaring non-recognition of the Yan'an regime and suspending arms aid, thereby making clear its attitude of solely supporting the Chongqing troops. This change in American policy towards China greatly irritated Yan'an and the Soviet Union, and they have been unsparing in their criticism of Chongqing. The recent rhetoric of the Soviet Union and its strategic actions regarding Xinjiang and Outer Mongolia are clear manifestations of this. At this point, the fact that Chongqing has the United States as its backing and Yan'an has the Soviet Union as its backing has been undeniably exposed. Therefore, we must recognize that both Chongqing and Yan'an, although situated within the East Asian region, both tend to rely on external support.

### B-29s Bomb Hamamatsu Yesterday; Incendiary Bombs Dropped Near Yokkaichi

Tokyo, 18th (Central News Agency) – The Tokai Military District Headquarters announced at 1:00 PM on the 18th: Approximately 80 B-29s from the Mariana Islands base entered the area around the southern coast of the Shima Peninsula at around 0:45 on the 18th, gradually gathering near the mouth of Ise Bay. The first batch of approximately 50 aircraft advanced east over the Atsumi Peninsula, attacking the vicinity of Hamamatsu City with incendiary bombs for about an hour, and retreated southward over the sea from the vicinity of Tatekawa and Suruga Bay around 2:00 AM. The second batch of approximately 30 aircraft passed through the central part of the Chita Peninsula from Ise Bay towards the northwest, attacking the vicinity of Yokkaichi with incendiary bombs. A portion passed through the areas of Tsu and Matsusaka. During that time, the enemy aircraft acted intermittently in both areas with one or a small number of planes at a time, causing fires in various places within Hamamatsu City and Yokkaichi City, which were extinguished by around 5:00 AM. The extent of the damage caused by the air raid on both cities is currently under investigation.

Kyushu and Shikoku Were Attacked Earlier

Tokyo, 18th (Central News Agency) – The Western Military District Headquarters announced at 10:00 AM on the 18th: 100 enemy B-29s from the Mariana Islands base, from 11:00 PM on June 17th to around 4:20 AM on the 18th, entered the Kanmon area and the vicinity of Kagoshima City with a portion of their force, while the main force entered the vicinity of Omuta City. Naval mines were dropped in the Kanmon area, and fires broke out in the vicinity of Kagoshima and Omuta Cities, which were extinguished around 6:00 AM on the 18th due to the efforts of Japanese military and civilian personnel. Damage to important facilities from this enemy air raid was minimal.

Osaka, 18th (Central News Agency) – Eight enemy B-29s, which entered through the Kii Channel at 10:00 PM on the 17th, dropped naval mines in the Akashi and Naruto Straits before retreating. Simultaneously, approximately seven other enemy aircraft, heading north along the Bungo Channel from the southwestern tip of Shikoku, dropped naval mines in the Suo Nada and Kanmon Straits before escaping.

Editorial

### Current Situation in Europe and America and the Three-Power Conference

More than a month has passed since the end of the European War, and the development of the international situation is not as predicted by most observers, not only failing to take a rapid turn for the better, but also exhibiting detours, twists, and even dangerous signs. In the past month or so, the San Francisco United Nations Conference has been fraught with conflicts, evolving into a confrontation between small and medium-sized countries and the so-called powerful nations. The fact that small and medium-sized countries dare to express a stubborn attitude at the conference is actually supported by Britain or the United States. Therefore, this opposition between large and small countries is actually an opposition between the major powers, namely Britain, the United States, the Soviet Union, and France. If this opposition is not resolved, the so-called United Nations World Peace and Security Conference will not produce any results.

During the San Francisco Conference, the biggest incidents of conflict between major powers, in addition to the long-standing issues of Poland, Argentina, and the issue of colonial trusteeships at the United Nations Conference, the voting rights of the Security Council, regional security organizations, the issue of launching military sanctions against "aggressor states," and the procedures for passing the new League of Nations organizational charter, etc., recently, there have also been military and political issues between Britain, the United States, and Yugoslavia over the ports of Trieste and Graz, territorial claims between Britain, the United States, France, and Italy, armed conflicts between Britain and France in Syria and Lebanon, various disputes between Britain, the United States, the Soviet Union, and France over the occupied areas of Germany, the issue of the transfer and treatment of prisoners of war between Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union, and even recently, the dispute between Britain and France over Tangier in northwestern Africa. All of these issues involve the post-war struggle for spheres of influence between imperialism and socialism, the struggle for rights between imperialist countries, and the struggle for liberation between imperialist hegemony and small and weak colonial nations. The content is very complex, but the basic factor lies in the mutual suspicion and hatred between Britain, the United States, and France.

Recently, the most obvious suspicion between Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union is the rise of anti-Soviet activities in British and American political circles. Particularly in British political circles, they want to restore the new European balance of power system centered on Britain after World War I, but this has provoked open attacks from the opposition party on the Churchill regime, resulting in the recent British political upheaval, the dissolution of the coalition cabinet, and the dissolution of Parliament on the 15th of this month, with political turmoil surging along with the election campaign. In the United States, the political struggle between anti-Soviet factions and Roosevelt factions has also begun, causing President Truman to feel deeply uneasy and forcing him to partially reorganize the government.

However, the severity of the international situation is constantly increasing. As a result, the call for a three-power conference of Truman, Churchill, and Stalin is growing louder and louder, attempting to use the three-power conference to resolve all of the above international disputes in a comprehensive manner. Because Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union have all agreed in principle to the three-power conference, Truman has made a painful decision to send Roosevelt's most trusted confidants, Davis and Hopkins, leaders of the American progressive politicians, to London and Moscow to lobby. Due to the active efforts of these two personal representatives of Truman, Churchill and Stalin have gradually expressed their willingness to cooperate in international policies. As a result, recently, starting with the Polish issue, issues such as the administration of the occupied areas of Germany and the disputes in the San Francisco Conference have gradually turned around, paving the way for the three-power conference. However, the fundamental contradictions between the three countries have not been resolved, and it remains to be seen whether continuous meetings will be of any help.

### Mr. Chen Binhe Returns to Shanghai and Discusses the Food Situation After Participating in the Deliberations

Mr. Chen Binsu, a municipal advisory committee member of this city, returned to Shanghai yesterday after being summoned to Beijing by acting Chairman Chen of the National Government to participate in deliberations on the food problem. The reporter specially approached Mr. Chen, who was kind enough to make the following statement:

The Authorities Are Concerned About the Food Problem

Q: Was your trip to Beijing specifically to discuss the food problem? A: I have not been to Nanjing for fifteen years. On the 14th, I was summoned by acting Chairman Chen. Recognizing that the seriousness of the food problem has increased, I was very willing to contribute my humble opinion for the authorities to consider. Also summoned to Beijing at that time were Governor Ren of Jiangsu Province and former Ambassador to Japan Cai. According to my observation, in the past two weeks, all relevant authorities of the National Government have focused all their efforts on the food problem, and the Allied authorities are also very concerned. Therefore, with the common determination of the Chinese and Japanese authorities, they resolutely took emergency measures regarding rice and grain. We, standing from the people's perspective, express our admiration and gratitude. On the day the emergency measures were announced, it happened to rain, and the farmland was eagerly hoping for timely rain after a long drought. It can truly be said that "heaven helps those who help themselves."

Strive for Rational Control Techniques

Q: Now that the emergency measures for rice and grain have been announced, will the control of rice and grain be lifted in the future?

A: The current measures for rice and grain are temporary emergency measures. During this time of war, implementing economic control policies is inevitable in principle, especially in China, where political power is weak and the morality of some merchants has declined, requiring more rational economic control. In addition to participating in the deliberations in Beijing, I also exchanged opinions individually with various central authorities, the Allied embassies, and key personnel twice. All parties were extremely concerned about the food problem and unanimously agreed that, in the future, the control techniques must be suitable for China's national conditions and people's sentiments, and strive to be rational and reduce unnecessary suffering for the people. As for the specific measures, they are still under final consideration and have not yet reached the stage of being announced. Currently, after the emergency measures, the second major task is to suppress rice prices, starting with measures such as smoothing the rice supply, cracking down on hoarding, preventing speculation, and adjusting coarse grains, jointly carried out by the Chinese and Japanese authorities and civil forces.

There Is Absolutely No Speculation in the Beijing Market

Q: What are the recent rice prices in Nanjing?

A: When I arrived, the rice price was 480,000 yuan per shi (unit of dry measure). When I left Beijing by night train on the 17th, it was 240,000 yuan per shi. Once the supply source is smooth, it will definitely be lower again. Mayor Zhou of Nanjing has made great efforts to smooth the supply of rice and grain. The general livelihood of the people is also more stable, and the market is quite calm. Speculative activities such as gold prices and stocks in the Shanghai market do not exist in Nanjing.

Releasing Coarse Grains to Adjust the People's Food

Q: According to reports, the Allied military authorities have agreed to release as much of the wheat and coarse grains purchased previously in Shanghai as possible and distribute them to the people. When will this be realized?

A: On the afternoon of the 17th, when I was about to leave, I visited the Allied General Headquarters to inquire about this matter. They expressed their responsibility to handle it, and they will be able to provide a steady supply soon. I immediately expressed my gratitude on behalf of the citizens of Shanghai. At a time when military demand is urgent, the Allied military authorities are emphasizing the people's food. Not only have they stopped military procurement, but they are also releasing the purchased coarse grains for adjustment, which is especially commendable. I hope that the citizens of this city will not panic excessively about food, and rice prices may return to the previous levels. The Nanjing Chinese and Japanese authorities also believe that the surge in coarse grain prices in Shanghai along with rice is extremely unreasonable and advocate for strict crackdowns. This time, the Shanghai Coarse Grain Industry Association voluntarily issued a notice to its members to sell coarse grains at fair prices, which is commendable. However, there are still a few coarse grain merchants and outsiders hoarding and speculating. I hope that citizens will report them so that the authorities can crack down on them.

### Japanese Elite Troops Operate in Henan, Occupying Guanzhuang, Chadaokou, and Other Places

Henan Front, 18th (Central News Agency) – Japanese elite troops in the Henan area launched a fierce attack on the troops of the First War Area of Chongqing at dawn on May 13th. On the 18th, after capturing Piankou, Wuhou, Xindian, and Wuhouyao, they captured Guanzhuang, a key point between Lingbao and Lushi, and Chadaokou on the 19th, leaving them with no time to reorganize their formations. In one fell swoop, they marched south along Lushi Street. On the 23rd, they occupied Shitai Mountain, Majia Mountain, and the western highlands of Baijiacun, north of Guandaokou, seizing strategic key points near Guandaokou. The Chongqing 40th and 38th Armies, at the key point of contact in Guandaokou, were in a miserable state due to the fierce Japanese attacks. The 90th Army was also rushing north from Lushi. At the same time, they gathered about five divisions of troops in the vicinity, preparing for a counter-attack. The Japanese army fought back at the Lushi Street position and inflicted heavy damage on a part of the 206th Division of the 40th Army that attacked Luotuo Slope, defeating them. At this point, the central axis of the Chongqing First War Area Army, which was calling for a general counter-attack, was completely thrown into chaos. From the beginning of the operation to the end of May, the verified total battle results were as follows: 1,074 bodies buried, 62 prisoners captured, and a large number of supplies seized.

Henan Front, 18th (Central News Agency) – Chadaokou, which the Chongqing side claimed to be unassailable despite repeated attacks, is a modern fortress throughout the mountain. However, after a single fierce attack by the Japanese army, it was breached. The terrain in that area is constructed with circular communication trenches and foxholes. The newly formed 40th Army was guarding the area, firing outward from the gun emplacements. From the night of the 17th to the morning of the 18th, the Japanese army suddenly launched a night attack and a dawn attack, daring to set up five-meter to ten-meter shelter trenches and forcibly broke through several points, with all members engaging in hand-to-hand combat and storming into the enemy's positions. At 9:00 PM on the 19th, the Japanese flag was finally raised high on the city walls.

Henan Front, 18th (Central News Agency) – Lushi Street, which is under Japanese control, is the main thoroughfare connecting Lingbao, Lushi, Xi'an, and other places along the Yellow River. It is the most important route for the Chongqing First War Area. The Chongqing army in that area, fearing its loss, successively gathered the reserve army from the eastern front of Henan and the second base in the rear. In this operation alone, the Chongqing side has deployed a total of three armies and nine divisions, attempting to prevent the Japanese army from advancing south. It also transferred approximately 300 wartime cadre trainees from the 40th Army to Chadaokou. In addition, it ordered the 53rd Division to gather in the Shugou Dong area, and the 90th Army is also gradually advancing to the front lines, hoping to reverse the decline.

### Movements of Chongqing Troops in Northwest Guangxi

Guangzhou, 18th (Central News Agency) – Chongqing troops in the northwest of Guangxi Province have shown signs of intensification in recent days. On the 8th, Commander-in-Chief of the Army He Yingqin and the combat commander of the U.S. Army stationed in Chongqing, Xin Keer A, inspected the area. At the same time, Minister of Transportation Yu Feipeng also flew to the area to inspect the conditions along the road, returning to Chongqing on the 11th. According to Chongqing Broadcasting on the 14th, Chen Tinghong, Director of the Southwest Highway Administration, went to Nandan, northwest of Hechi in Guangxi Province, on the afternoon of the 13th to inspect the transportation of military supplies to the front lines of Guangxi Province and the construction of various highways. Furthermore, Deputy Director Qiu Bingmin was sent to Baise for inspection. On the one hand, the 2nd General Team of the Wartime Transportation Administration Bureau Highway, stationed in Zhijiang, Hunan Province, was urgently transferred to northwest Guangxi Province. The 1st General Team was also ordered to be subordinate to the Southwest Highway and is currently moving from Kunming to Guiyang, indicating that the Chongqing army has strengthened its forces in that area and is preparing to launch a counter-attack on the Guilin-Liuzhou area.

### Strict Restrictions on Japanese Postal Items

Tokyo, 18th (Central News Agency) – The Japanese government has suspended all postal services to Korea, the Kwantung Leased Territory, and Manchuria, except for postcards and official correspondence. Starting on the 19th, postal services to China, with the exception of letters, will also be suspended. The Japanese Ministry of Communications officially announced this on the 17th.

### San Francisco Conference Passes the Five-Power Compromise: Veto Issue Resolved

Tokyo, 18th (Central News Agency) – The veto issue, the last major problem at the San Francisco Conference, has been resolved through a compromise among the five major powers: Britain, the United States, France, and China. Despite strong opposition from small and medium-sized countries such as Australia, the veto power was adopted in accordance with the five-power compromise in the vote on the 12th. The term "veto power" is not used in the International Charter. According to the Yalta voting method, any decision of the Security Council must be agreed upon by all permanent members, but the scope of this unanimity is not specified. In practical terms, if one of the five major powers opposes a decision of the Security Council, the decision cannot be made. To fully realize the function of the new international organization, the Allied nations, especially the five major powers, must cooperate. If one of them vetoes, and the other nations cannot accept it, the international organization will lose its meaning. Therefore, the Soviet Union's demand for the permanent members to have veto power can be said to be correct, but it clearly shows that the international organization relies on international trust. Therefore, the opposition of small and medium-sized countries to this plan is also natural, because if they do not express their opposition, it is tantamount to admitting that the International Charter fundamentally tolerates the absolute dominance of the great powers. Therefore, Australian Foreign Minister Rommel proposed an amendment that the veto power should not be invoked when deciding to use force, which was enthusiastically supported by New Zealand and other small and medium-sized countries, but ultimately failed. No matter what kind of international organization emerges after the war, it will only be a liaison mechanism for various governments to deal with post-war issues and international affairs. Unless it is an organization to oppress the weak within its scope, if the great powers act as they please, it will be the same as the old League of Nations, a mirage that disappears in an instant.

Differing Views Among Nations on the Functions of the General Assembly

Lisbon, 18th (Central News Agency) – According to a dispatch from San Francisco: The Executive Committee of the San Francisco Conference held a meeting on the morning of the 17th to discuss how to handle the Soviet Union's opposition to granting the General Assembly of the future security organization broad powers of discussion. U.S. Senator Vandenberg, speaking on behalf of the four inviting nations at the Committee on Political and Security Functions of the General Assembly on the afternoon of the 16th, argued that the functions of the General Assembly should be limited to recommendations rather than discussions. Representatives from Britain, Ukraine, and the Soviet Union all spoke in support of Vandenberg's views. However, the committee meeting remained deadlocked, and the next session has not yet been decided. At the five-power conference on the morning of the 16th, Soviet representative Gromyko indicated that he would raise this issue again at the aforementioned committee meeting. Subsequently, the four major powers still approved the compromise proposed by Vandenberg. However, the small countries opposed this issue and will be discussed by the Executive Committee at its next meeting.

### Criminals Executed in Chongqing for Encroaching on Military Supplies

Guangzhou, 18th (Central News Agency) – According to a Chongqing broadcast: On the 14th, Chongqing, under the order of Chiang Kai-shek, executed Liang Lin, the former director of the Investigation Department serving in the Kunming Rear Service Headquarters, as well as one major general and one colonel, by shooting for the crime of encroaching on military supplies.

### Representatives of the Polish Government in London Arrive in Soviet Capital

Stockholm, Sweden, 18th (Central News Agency) – According to a London correspondent in Moscow: The Polish issue, which has been a major obstacle to the unity of the United Nations, may soon be resolved.

### British Member of the War Crimes Executive Committee Goes to Soviet Union

### All Members of the Indian Congress Party Executive Committee Regain Freedom: Simla Conference to Be Held Next Monday

Lisbon, 18th (Central News Agency) – According to a dispatch from London: British Secretary of State for India Amery announced to reporters on the 15th that the British government had released eight members of the Executive Committee of the Indian National Congress Party on the night of the 14th, seven of whom were Hindus and one was a Muslim, namely Acharya, the current chairman of the Congress Party. Of the fifteen executive members, seven have been released, and all members of the Executive Committee of the Congress Party have now regained their freedom.

Lisbon, 18th (Central News Agency) – Indian Governor-General Wavell, due to new proposals put forward by the British government, announced that a conference of Indian leaders from all factions will be held in Simla on the 25th. According to a dispatch from New Delhi, Jinnah, the president of the Muslim League, requested that the conference be postponed for two weeks in order to make contact beforehand, but Wavell sternly rejected this, stating that the conference must be held on the 25th, and that detailed discussions before the conference are not desired.

Lisbon, 18th (Central News Agency) – According to news from Bombay: It is heard that Acharya, the chairman of the Indian Parliament, has been invited to participate in the conference of Indian leaders to be held in Simla on the 25th.

Nehru's Speech Vigorously Criticizes British Policy

Lisbon, 18th (Central News Agency) – According to a dispatch from Bombay: Nehru, who was released on the evening of the 14th, gave a speech on the 16th, vigorously criticizing Britain's hypocrisy policy as follows: "If India is not liberated, there will be no proper new world order. The basic goal of the Congress Party remains 'India's independence and freedom.' In a world where the strong consistently dominate the weak, India's independence is unattainable, but until four hundred million people gain freedom, there will never be a stable order in the world."

In addition to the famous Congress Party and the Muslim League, there is also a powerful party "All India Party" with a strong reputation. The representatives of this party have not been invited to participate in the Simla Conference. It is no wonder that the leader of this party protested. As the Simla Conference approaches, it can be seen that the political situation in India remains perilous.

### Dr. Haw-Haw Accused of Treason and Tried in London

Stockholm, Sweden, 18th (Central News Agency) – According to news from London: William Joyce (also known as Lord Haw-Haw), who is accused of broadcasting speeches for the Germans, was brought to Bow Street Magistrates' Court in London today to be tried for high treason. When Chief Magistrate Bridge asked him if he had any defense against the charge of high treason, he replied "No". When the charges were read, the magistrate asked him if he had any arguments, and he replied, "I have heard the charges read and will await the verdict. I do not want to add to or subtract from the confession I made in the military department." When the magistrate asked if he had any questions, he replied, "No." Joyce did not protest against being remanded for further hearing next Monday, so he stood in the dock for only a few minutes.

### Serious Political Situation in Belgium

Stockholm, Sweden, 18th (Central News Agency) – According to news from Brussels: Belgian Prime Minister Achille Van Acker has effectively resigned because he saw that King Leopold was about to return to the country. However, he announced yesterday that "I am not leaving the government and hope to continue as Prime Minister." This statement by Achille Van Acker is a clear indication that he is temporarily abandoning his authority in the hope that King Leopold will abdicate and not interfere in politics. The situation in Belgium has become serious.

Lisbon, 18th (Central News Agency) – According to a dispatch from Brussels: The political circles in Belgium are very tense over the issue of King Leopold. It is rumored that if the King returns to the country, the anti-King faction will launch large-scale strikes and demonstrations.

### Western Foreign Ministry Protests the Attack on the Train

Stockholm, Sweden, 18th (Central News Agency) – According to a Paris report received in London last night: Regarding the incident in Hendaye, the Spanish diplomatic authorities yesterday summoned a member of the French diplomatic delegation in Spain to lodge a serious protest. The report also stated that the French Consul General in Geneva, Gore, visited a hospital in Geneva to express his condolences to the Spanish soldiers injured in the incident and apologized for the unfortunate event that occurred. According to semi-official sources, a French newspaper published yesterday stated that it is hard to believe that the train attacked by French people at Hendaye station only carried soldiers of the Spanish "Blue Division" or members of the French Milice of the former Vichy government. The Spanish "Blue Division" in German uniforms has always been regarded by the French authorities as war criminals. The train actually carried Spanish diplomatic and consular personnel, workers serving in Germany, and Spanish residents living in Germany, who were eager to return to Spain via France. According to news received in Paris on the 16th, the demonstrators in Hendaye had issued a warning to the train departing from Switzerland, stating that the returning Spaniards included soldiers of the "Blue Division" and members of the French Milice. According to official news from Madrid, the train carried 448 people, of whom 61 were seriously injured and sent to hospitals, and 100 were slightly injured. A report issued by Spain stated that the train also carried Spanish people and their families who were engaged in commerce in Germany.

### British Aircraft Losses in the European War Exceed 16,000

Stockholm, Sweden, 18th (Central News Agency) – According to a dispatch from London, the British Air Ministry announced on the 16th that British Air Force losses since the beginning of the war are as follows: 9,163 bombers, 3,558 fighters, 780 other types of aircraft, 2,111 tactical air force aircraft, and 1,479 coastal defense aircraft.

### Spain Prepares to Hold General Elections

Lisbon, 18th (Central News Agency) – Spanish Head of State Franco recently announced that the Spanish government is actively preparing for general elections. According to a Reuters dispatch from London, the British press is paying close attention to the Spanish government's impending restoration of a republican system. However, Spain has no concrete preparations for a democratic system, so general elections to achieve this goal will not be easy. If the dictatorship of the Falange Party is not abolished and about 300,000 exiled politicians are not allowed to return, the general elections will inevitably be a mere formality.

### Goering Reveals German War Plans

Stockholm, Sweden, 18th (Central News Agency) – According to news from New York radio quoting sources from the U.S. military in Germany: Former German Air Force Minister Goering, who was captured by the U.S. Seventh Army in mid-May, said in a statement a few days ago, "Our German authorities originally planned to seize Iceland and the Azores, and also planned to attack Gibraltar from the rear via Spain."

### An Overview of Dongting Xishan

— Lan Yu

Glimpses of Local Customs

Xishan is one of the areas for dispersing the population of Shanghai. Looking at Xishan, standing alone in Taihu Lake and surrounded by water on all sides, it is indeed a reasonably ideal wartime haven.

Xishan resembles the shape of a dustpan (簸箕). Its circumference is approximately ninety li, comprising eight villages and two towns: Donghe Town and Xiaoxia Town; Huili, Zhenxia, Qixian, Lucun, Qianwan, Dongyuan, Hanzhi, and Litang. Donghe Town is relatively the most bustling and also serves as an intermediary and transportation hub.

Currently, the entire mountain has a population of approximately 34,000 people, with farmers accounting for 70%, merchants accounting for 10%, and others such as fishermen, herders, and miners accounting for 20%. Due to its remote location, modern civilization has not been widely popularized, and feudalistic characteristics are very strong. At the same time, it has historically been spared from war and natural disasters, and its produce is abundant, enabling the people to be self-sufficient. This has led to a traditional habit of leisure and idleness. Outside of work, they pay little attention to worldly affairs, and most of their free time is spent in teahouses. However, the local customs are honest and simple, and the people are sincere and trustworthy. When faced with setbacks, they tend to attribute them to fate. Pedestrians give way to each other, and they value humility and avoid disputes, with very few urban habits.

Scenic Spots and Historical Sites

There are many scenic spots and historical sites, and historically, there have been many well-known figures from this area. For example, Xu Jin, the Minister of Personnel during the Jiajing reign of the Ming Dynasty, was from a prominent family in this area. To this day, his descendants are numerous, accounting for almost all of Donghe Town. The scenery is picturesque, with undulating mountains. Piaomiao Peak is the highest. When the weather is gloomy or on rainy evenings, floating clouds linger around the mountain peaks, creating a misty and distant mountain vista. At the foot of Piaomiao Peak is the Xuan Emperor Temple, which is very popular with pilgrims during the spring and autumn seasons.

The best scenery is said to be at Shigong Mountain, located on the lakeshore, with an ancient temple on top and lush trees. However, at present, bandits frequent the area, and tourists avoid it. In Zhenxia Village is "The Ninth Cave Under Heaven," which is very deep and extremely dark. Legend has it that it connects to Lingyin Temple in Hangzhou, and there are many bizarre myths. However, no one has ever reached the bottom of it. Although there are occasionally curious individuals who venture deep into the cave with torches, they are always deterred by the harmful gas inside and return halfway. In front of the cave is the Yue Temple, and behind the cave is the Cao'an Temple. From this location, one can see Dongshan, separated only by a body of water.

In Zhenxia Baoshan, there is still the Dayun Temple. Near Donghe Town Nan除, this is also the place of origin for the famous "Biluochun" tea. The monks here all serve guests with homemade fragrant tea. Nearby is the ancient Biluo Temple. According to legend, the reason why Biluochun tea is famous is because Emperor Qianlong visited this place during his travels in Jiangnan. The nuns had nothing to offer him, so they hastily picked mountain tea leaves,贴于胸口(directly translated to:贴于胸口), dried them, and made tea for Emperor Qianlong. After drinking it, the emperor praised it as good tea, with a milky fragrance, hence the name. The story is somewhat naive, but it is also quite humorous. In addition, there is also Tianfu Temple, which was renovated during the Wanli reign of the Ming Dynasty but is now in ruins. In Qixian Village's Fuyuan Temple, there are many ancient objects, such as a bronze bell, stone railing, and stone whisk.

Agricultural Production and Harvests

In addition to crops such as rice and wheat, Xishan's main products are silk and fruit. In addition, aquatic products are also abundant. In terms of agriculture, due to the limited amount of flat land, rice production is very low, only enough to meet the needs of the entire mountain population for two months. Cultivation and tools have not been improved much, and old methods are still used. The situation of silk production is far from what it used to be. According to the farmers on the mountain, before the incident, one dan of silk could be worth two and a half dans of 主. Now, it is only 时之零数. Farmers, seeing that there is no profit to be made, are cutting down mulberry trees for firewood. As for fruits, they are Xishan's special products, available year-round. For example, the recently marketed "White Shaobi Pear". Ginkgo and waxberries are famous products of the mountain. Loquats are everywhere in Suzhou and Shanghai around the Dragon Boat Festival, but they are not commonly seen on this mountain. This is because in recent years, the rural areas have been declining, and livelihoods are difficult. People compete to sell any small amount of produce to exchange for daily necessities and to fund agricultural capital.

Loquat Market Conditions

I once inquired with the local farmers about this year's loquat market, and they all shook their heads. Transporting loquats to Suzhou requires passing through about twenty checkpoints along the way, and the amount of expense is uncertain. Therefore, if the selling price locally is 300 yuan per catty, it must reach 700 yuan in Suzhou. When they transport them to the merchants in Suzhou, the merchants are aware of the farmers' situation and exploit their weaknesses, so they undervalue them. Although the farmers want to wait for a better price, they are limited by the need for food, travel expenses, and storage, as well as the fact that it is the busy farming season, so they have no choice but to sell at a loss. Therefore, although the price of loquats is high this year, it is fortunate if the growers do not lose money.

The new price for waxberries is 25,000 yuan. This year, there has not been much rain, and the yield is not abundant, nor are they as sweet and round as in previous years. Chestnuts are about to enter the market. Those produced in this volume are particularly fragrant, sweet, and large. Peaches are still rarely available. In addition, chestnuts, pomegranates, oranges, and cherries are produced in abundance. The above-mentioned fruit trees are planted all over the mountains. Every year in March and April when they bloom, looking out over the fields, the red and green colors are interspersed, and the fragrance is beautiful. Being in such an environment gives one the feeling of being in a paradise.

Coal Mine Conditions

The mineral resources are abundant. There are currently two coal mining companies, Shicheng and Shishan, each with just over two thousand employees. The workers are divided into male workers, female workers, and child workers, with three shifts a day, each working eight hours. The mining method is primitive. Shicheng has four shafts, and Shishan has one shaft, with a depth of more than ten zhang. Each cave has tunnels that connect them. There is a winch at the mouth of the shaft, with a long rope wound around it. When miners go down the shaft, several female workers rotate the winch. One end of the rope is tied to a hanging basket, which slowly rotates and descends. Each shaft is equipped with two winches, which take turns raising and lowering. When miners mine coal at the bottom of the mine, they first drill a hole at the bottom, then fill it with explosives, ignite the fuse, and detonate it. Therefore, the coal blocks that are mined are not large. The coal mined at the bottom of the mine is collected by child workers in carts and pushed along the tunnel to the nearest bottom of the shaft. Then, the coal blocks are transferred to the hanging basket and raised by the female workers above. The two mines produce more than one hundred tons of coal per day. Most of the coal produced is supplied to the Huazhong Electric Power Company. The wages of the workers in the two mines, calculated in terms of commodity prices, are currently around 5,000 yuan per day for each worker. The wages of female and child workers are 75% of that. In normal times, there are also low-priced sales, and their wages are higher than those of the staff.

Other mineral products include white clay (for making fire bricks and porcelain), alum stone (for enamel raw materials), yellow sand, stone materials (for making cement and lime), and manganese mines have also been discovered in Litang. It is said that the reserves are quite abundant, and once developed, the output will definitely be considerable.

Education and Public Security

Education in Xishan is extremely backward. Most farmers believe that farming can provide self-sufficiency, so they do not pay much attention to the education of their children. There are currently two complete district-run primary schools, eight village-run primary schools, and one or two private schools. The facilities are very simple. The total number of children enrolled in the district is approximately over one thousand. Public security is maintained by the police and the security team. The sanitary conditions are extremely poor. In the past, there were medical facilities, but they closed due to lack of funding. One was surgeon Jin Zhongkang, and the other was physician Juehua Temple 和尚. As for transportation, there are only rickshaws in the towns, and the number is small. In the villages, bamboo sedan chairs and flatbed carts are still used. There are no roads, and the widest streets are about five feet wide. Most of the public property consists of temples, followed by ancestral halls. The local houses are tall, spacious, and extremely sturdy, and some were built during the Ming and Qing dynasties.

District Administration Promotion

Since the new District Head Jin Baidi took office, recognizing that Xishan urgently needs development and is one of the areas for dispersing the population of Shanghai, he felt a great responsibility and spared no effort to promote government affairs. His work includes:

1.  Contacting relevant authorities to facilitate the supply of rice.
2.  Encouraging farmers to step up production and plant miscellaneous grains in unused mountainous areas.
3.  Training young farmers to strengthen self-defense capabilities and maintain local public security.
4.  Organizing literacy schools for farmers to instill practical knowledge.

In terms of dispersal, assisting the Shanghai Dispersal Committee branch in the local area, investigating the number of public properties and houses for use by Shanghai charities, schools, and population resettlement.

Dispersal Work

From the reporter's observation, dispersing the population of Shanghai to Xishan is quite appropriate. People from Shanghai have repeatedly visited the area for inspection. The mountain not only can accommodate a considerable number of people, but also has abundant resources. It is very appropriate to transfer Shanghai's capital to the area for development and construction. The following points should be paid attention to when preparing for dispersal here: public security, transportation, food, daily necessities, and the collection of furniture.

The local public security forces are weak. Although they are strengthening the training of strong young men, it is difficult to achieve results in the short term, and they also lack firearms. Taihu Lake has long been a den of bandits, especially since the war, with many firearms scattered around. There are many who take risks. Some are forced by livelihood, some are discharged soldiers and police, and some are bad elements. Taihu Lake is vast and easy to escape into, and their appearances are erratic, making it difficult to control them. If these lake bandits are not eliminated, the dispersal work will be affected.

Secondly, regarding transportation, there are several places in Taihu Lake and the inner rivers of Xishan where the water is very shallow, and flat-bottomed boats should be used. Furthermore, regarding food, the mountain's production originally only meets the needs of the mountain's population for two months, and the rest relies on external supplies. If the population of Shanghai is dispersed to this place, a large amount of procurement must be carried out in advance from various places, with at least three or four months' worth of inventory. In addition to rice, oil, salt, vegetables, etc., there must also be a considerable amount of storage. Again, daily necessities and furniture, etc., should be adequately prepared and transported in advance.

If the above four points can be resolved, then the dispersal work can proceed smoothly. (The End)

### Banks Supply Funds to Grain Merchants - Usage Must Be Proper - Financial Inspection Office Strictly Inspects to Prevent Hoarding

Recently, rice prices in various places have been rising wildly day by day without any end in sight, especially in Shanghai. The government has decisively implemented emergency food countermeasures. Zhou Fohai, the General Manager of the Central Reserve Bank and Mayor of Shanghai, made the following statement on the matter yesterday:

President Zhou's Statement

"In view of the recent extraordinarily high rice prices, the National Government has decided to take emergency measures, temporarily halting the rice unification committee's purchasing activities, abolishing movement restrictions, and obtaining full cooperation from allied nations to suspend military rice purchases. After the implementation of these emergency measures, the source of rice supply will naturally be fully and smoothly provided, prices will gradually decrease, and people's livelihoods can be maintained. However, after the abolition of movement restrictions, it is difficult to guarantee that unscrupulous merchants will not engage in purchasing and hoarding, which will lead to a rice shortage, which will still be difficult to resolve. In order to strictly prevent these malpractices, I have ordered the Financial Inspection Office of the Central Reserve Bank to inspect the funds supplied by various banks to grain merchants to determine whether they are used for proper purchasing and transportation, and I have also ordered the economic police to secretly investigate whether there are any grain merchants hoarding and monopolizing. Once verified, they will be severely punished according to the law, without leniency."

### Miscellaneous Grains Sold Universally at Fair Prices - Police Bureau Strictly Enforces - Economic Police Team Dispatches Investigators

The Economic Security Section of the Fourth Department of the Shanghai Police Bureau and the Economic Police Brigade are actively promoting economic security matters, especially the strict management of prices. In accordance with the plans stipulated by economic administrative agencies such as the Economic Bureau and the Price Review Committee, and the strict enforcement of fixed prices, all illegal merchants who violate economic regulations or exceed the price limit are investigated and dealt with. Regarding miscellaneous grains, the Miscellaneous Grains Industry Association has formulated prices for red beans, etc., for and the people's livelihood, and has submitted them to the Economic Bureau for approval and implementation. Starting from the 17th, the association was instructed to order all member firms to comply with universal sales, with a temporary limit of five catties per person. The Economic Security Section and the Economic Police Brigade have dispatched personnel to investigate miscellaneous grain firms in all districts of the city. If there are any cases of exceeding the above-mentioned fair price or refusing to sell goods, they will be investigated and dealt with. The public can also openly report them.

Standard Pricing for Miscellaneous Grains

The Shanghai District Miscellaneous Grains Industry Association has, in accordance with the order of the Municipal Economic Bureau, stipulated standard pricing for the sale of miscellaneous grains for the needs of relieving the people's food supply. The standard pricing will be for fifteen days at a time, and no unauthorized increase is allowed, so as to make rice stable and suppress rising prices. The association notified its member firms yesterday to strictly comply with this. All retailers must absolutely not refuse to sell or increase prices, in order to maintain the people's food supply and emphasize public orders. The industry has been fully implemented yesterday.

Black Market Rice Prices Are Declining

In addition, in order to be concerned about the people's livelihood and with the understanding of the allied nations, the government has taken emergency measures to suppress rice prices and facilitate supplies, stopping the purchase of military rice, and the Rice Unification Committee has also stopped purchasing activities. Moreover, the allied forces' garrison authorities will sell wheat and miscellaneous grains purchased in Shanghai, so the people's minds have been calmed. The Economic Police Bureau has also received a clear order from the government to no longer restrict or crack down on the transportation of rice, allowing merchants and the people to transport it freely. Economic checkpoints in the suburbs have stopped restricting the transport of rice, so black market prices of rice are declining day by day. Especially due to the reasonable pricing and universal sale of miscellaneous grains, rice prices can be expected to decline day by day, and citizens need not worry.

### Improving Urban Transportation - Planning to Establish Public Horse-Drawn Carriages - Interview with Construction Bureau Director Xu

Shanghai's urban area is vast and has a large population, but public transportation tools are becoming increasingly scarce. For example, when streetcars are restricted to certain hours and the French Concession public buses (i.e., red buses) are completely suspended, it is extremely inconvenient for citizens to travel. A Central News Agency reporter specially visited Xu Jidun, Director of the Municipal Construction Bureau, who said the following:

Establishing Public Horse-Drawn Carriages

The reduction in streetcars and the suspension of French Concession buses are all due to electricity and fuel shortages, which are unavoidable phenomena during wartime. The bureau is extremely concerned about the recent difficulties in urban public transportation and is currently encouraging car dealers to establish public horse-drawn carriages, following the example of Nanjing, to operate along routes and charge low fares for the convenience of citizens. The Shanghai Public Horse-Drawn Carriage Preparatory Office has drafted an establishment plan, including planned routes and fare tables, which has been submitted to the bureau and forwarded to the municipal government for approval. Once approval is granted, it can be implemented.

Managing Tricycle Industry

Tricycles are a newly emerging transportation business since the Incident and are also the most important transportation tool at present. In the past, it was stipulated that licensed tricycles must first have a fixed route before obtaining a license, which led to many abuses in the operation of tricycles without licenses. Now, in order to crack down on unlicensed monopolies, the bureau has formulated provisional regulations for the management of licensed tricycles, which have been submitted to the municipal government for approval and promulgation. In the future, whether tricycles are owned by companies or individuals, they can apply for licenses in accordance with the regulations. In addition, the bureau will strictly crack down on tricycle drivers who demand extra fees beyond the prescribed fares, and hopes that citizens will cooperate and report them at any time.

Attaching Importance to Rickshaw Industry
There are many rickshaws operating in the urban area. In the past, disputes often arose between labor and management due to rent and other issues. However, during this extraordinary wartime period, management should sympathize with the hardships of labor, and labor should also take into account the capital of management. Mutual understanding and cooperation are the only way to avoid disputes. The bureau attaches great importance to this issue and is constantly tightening and improving it with all relevant parties.

### Extra Distribution of Household Flour - Actively Preparing

Rice prices in the city have been soaring incessantly, and ordinary people cannot afford to buy white rice, so most have switched to eating miscellaneous grains. Although the distribution of household flour can be carried out on schedule, it is still a drop in the bucket. The Shanghai District Flour Unified Distribution Office is extremely concerned about the pain of citizens due to the increased burden of food. It is now planning to organize an extra distribution of household flour to slightly alleviate the panic about the people's food supply and is currently actively preparing. In addition to requesting the Flour and Wheat Association to allocate a portion of flour, once the liaison with the relevant distribution agencies is completed and there are no other obstacles, it can often be realized within days.

### Sugar Allocation in Three Provinces and Cities - Continuing as Usual

Since the China-Japan Sugar Industry Association has been in charge of the unified distribution of sugar, four phases of sugar have been distributed in the city. It is learned that all the sugar allocated to the three provinces and cities of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui is still being allocated as usual after consultation with the relevant authorities. As for the areas that cannot be reached due to transportation problems, efforts are being made to transport them.

### Police Bureau's Regulations for Hiring Staff

Director Zhou of the Shanghai Police Bureau, because he inspected various branches, teams, stations, and institutes, found that when requesting to appoint staff members or fill the vacant positions, they directly submitted reports without considering the quality, which was a disregard for the essence of the police force. Although extremely good quality cannot be demanded, they should still seek reasonable quality, otherwise it is not bearable to make up the numbers with incompetent people. It is now stipulated that those who intend to join the police force must first be examined and approved by their respective units. If they are academically excellent and physically fit, they will be submitted to the General Bureau for examination in order to emphasize official duties. In addition, it was found that police officers who were to be examined only came for the examination after repeated notifications, and even when they came for the examination, most of them still did not bring photos, which delayed the process. In the future, when various branches, teams, stations, and institutes request to appoint staff members or fill vacant positions, they must instruct the persons concerned to bring their photos to the bureau for examination with the documents in order to expedite the process and avoid delays.

Two Chief Inspectors Transferred

It is also reported that Man Xijiu, the Chief Inspector of the Third Inspection District of the bureau's Inspection Department, and Xu 　　, the Chief Inspector of the Fourth Inspection District, have been transferred to each other. The two chief inspectors took office in their respective districts the day before yesterday.

### Hope to Report Malfeasance by China Railway Staff

Recently, the China Central Railway Company has made significant improvements in maintaining order at stations and improving the ticket purchase procedures for passengers. The crackdown on improper behavior and discourteous actions by general company staff has also been particularly strict. According to the person in charge of the Shanghai Administration Bureau's Inspection Office, if China Railway staff members are found to be involved in malfeasance, if members of the public can cooperate with the company, report them as much as possible, or provide relevant information, then in terms of sanctions and inspection, it can be twice the result with half the effort.

### Improving Popular Reading Material - The Serial Survey

— Sima Xiong

I believe that the serial comics on the streets are the publications with the most sequel readers. The readers of comic books have a really wide range, from middle school students, elementary school students, apprentices, small clerks, female workers, rickshaw pullers, to even garbage pickers wandering the streets, all are loyal readers of serial comics. Among them, most are children. The influence of the serial comics on them is tens of thousands of times higher than the textbooks in school.

However, what do serial comics give to children? Not long ago, a few children in Xujiahui left home to visit Taoist sites in Mount Emei. I think the force that motivated them was mostly serial comics.

It is undeniable that serial comics are popular reading material, especially the form of one side being a picture and the other side being concise text. In our country where illiteracy is widespread, it can indeed increase interest in reading and help in understanding the text. If used well, its effect is no less than that of popular education.

To improve serial comics and turn them into truly good popular things, the most important thing is to change the content. Some people think that changing the content will lose readers. This is wrong. If the change is good, it will not only attract the original readers, but also increase the number of subscribers, thereby achieving the purpose of popular education. First of all, I propose the following points:

1.  The authorities should take a stand on rectifying awareness, severely crack down on serial comics with absurd and strange content that can hinder physical and mental development, prohibit publication and circulation, and retain those with pure content.
2.  Various cultural associations, such as bookstores, newspapers, magazine publishers, and publishing companies, should use new forms and new content to publish new serial comics and sell them to small bookstores on the streets for the purpose of popularization.
3.  Publishers of serial comics should reform the content as much as possible, abolish gods, flying swords, and monsters, and use new characters as the protagonists of the stories.

In terms of content, what should replace those strange stories should be what the public really needs to read. Of course, the purpose of improving serial comics is not only to cater to the needs of the public, but also to improve the public's long-term standards. We cannot let that large group of readers always stay in the era of Huang Tiangang and Bai Yutang and must keep up with the times. For this reason, I believe that the content of new serial comics should include the following:

Narration of current events: such as the beginning and end of World War II, the San Francisco Conference, etc.

Evolution of society: on a small scale, such as the opening and recovery of the Shanghai Concession...

Life stories: countless tragedies in real life...

Historical stories: some of the most moving stories...

World knowledge: such as Arctic exploration, the invention of radio, African scholars...

I can't think of many at the moment, but I think that the knowledge that should be given to the public is correct, not just flying dramas and the like. As for students, if the textbooks can be visualized and illustrated, or even used for connecting (naturally improved) to replace the reference textbooks, I guarantee that the mood and interest in learning will increase thousands of times.

It seems that someone had already proposed improving serial comics, but until now, the same old stuff is still flooding the street stalls, unconsciously spreading toxins to the largest number of readers (and those readers usually only have this one reading material). I hope this time it's not just empty talk, because if even this cannot be done, then all education, especially popular education, is in vain.

### Fourth Issue of Gold Certificates to Be Released Tomorrow; Listing Price to Be Discussed and Determined Today

The fourth issue of gold certificates issued by the Central Reserve Bank is scheduled to be released tomorrow, the 20th. The sale period will remain three days, ending on the 22nd. The listing price for this issue of gold certificates will be discussed and determined at a meeting to be convened today, the 19th, taking market conditions into consideration. Regarding the gold certificate market, it is currently under renovation. It will open as soon as the equipment is complete.

Central Reserve Bank Business Hours Remain the Same

To save manpower and resources, banks and large firms in this city, through a joint meeting of the banking and money industries, decided to shorten business hours by two hours. Starting yesterday, the 18th, the original business hours of 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM and 1:00 PM to 3:00 PM were changed to 9:00 AM to 1:00 PM only. It is now known that, considering the busy workload of the Central Reserve Bank and for the convenience of citizens, their business hours will remain unchanged, from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM and 1:00 PM to 3:00 PM, without alteration.

### School Water Usage; Relaxed Quotas

Since the implementation of wartime water restrictions in this city, water usage by various schools has exceeded quotas, resulting in alarming monthly bills. After several negotiations between the Municipal Education Association and relevant authorities, requesting relaxed quotas and exemption from fines, the China Water and Electric Company has, after considering the actual situation of each school, approved the relaxation and, taking into account the financial difficulties of the education sector, agreed to postpone the payment of fines. It is reported that some schools have already received notifications from the company. Schools that have not yet applied can still apply to the Municipal Education Association.

### Hua Long Company Penalized for Falsely Reporting Business Tax Amount

To eliminate tax evasion, the Municipal Finance Bureau has instructed the tax offices in each district to send personnel to investigate whether the declared spring business tax amounts reported by various businesses are accurate. It is now known that Zhong Xiang-sheng, a member of the tax office in the Taishan Road district, and Xu Ning-sheng, an investigator, discovered that the accounting books of the Hua Long Company Consignment Department at 486 Taishan Road were of two types, genuine and false. Just as they were about to interrogate the relevant parties, the person in charge of the shop, Zhao Yi-ming, issued two checks for 100,000 yuan each, intending to offer a bribe. The two officials considered this an intentional insult to public officials and immediately submitted the genuine and false accounting books along with the checks. After investigation by the tax office, it was confirmed that the company should have paid 258,238 yuan in spring business tax. After deducting the 2,324 yuan that had already been paid, they were required to pay an additional 255,914 yuan. After requesting instructions on the penalty portion, the bureau approved the determination of falsified accounts and imposed a penalty of eight times the tax due, totaling 2,047,312 yuan. The bribery portion was leniently waived due to the ignorance of the merchant, and the checks were returned. Zhong and Xu were not tempted by the bribe and were each awarded a bonus of 50,000 yuan.

### Seamen's Special Party Branch Holds Delegates' Congress

The Special Party Branch of the Kuomintang held a delegates' congress on the afternoon of the 16th. More than 60 representatives from various district party branches, as well as representatives from relevant organizations, attended. The meeting was chaired by Li Kai-chen, who reported on the purpose of the meeting. Lu Tian-fang, Director of the Election Supervision Department representing Zuo Lan-xi, Deputy Minister of the Organization Department of the Central Party Headquarters, delivered a speech.

### Sports; Summer Soccer Invitational Tournament to Kick Off Early Next Month; Five Teams to Compete

The Shanghai Football Association, recognizing that the soccer season has ended, but wanting to prevent the skills of the first-division players from becoming rusty, has initiated the organization of a Summer Soccer Invitational Tournament. Preparations are now complete, and the competition is scheduled to begin in the first week of next month. The participants include five teams: Lianyi, Portuguese Businessmen, Overseas Chinese, Shanghai Police, and Hualun. Donghua was not invited due to player injuries and departures from Shanghai, making participation impossible. Among the five teams, Lianyi, Portuguese Businessmen, and Overseas Chinese will participate with the same lineup as in the league. Roberts Stoff and Mickey Dunn from the Shanghai Police team have withdrawn, and several famous French army generals have been added. In addition to the core players Liu Zu-ru and Lang Shao-shan, Hualun has also recruited all the German businessmen players, making their strength considerable. The quiet soccer scene is about to experience another lively atmosphere.

### Water Cut Off in Cuilian Lane, Changning Road; Appeal for Relaxed Limits

Cuilian Lane, 240 Changning Road, in western Shanghai, has a large population, but the water supply is insufficient, leading to excessive use. Recently, the entire lane has experienced a complete water cutoff, lasting for several days. Residents are forced to draw water from earthen wells for washing rice and vegetables, but the well water is murky and foul-smelling, and with the weather getting hotter, diseases are likely to spread. If no proper solution is found, the consequences will be dire. We urge the authorities to conduct an on-site investigation, consider the hardships of the people, and relax the water limits to maintain hygiene. We are filled with anticipation. (Residents of this lane)

### Report on Wanlan Middle School Concert

Wanlan Middle School used a grand concert of Chinese and Western music to commemorate the school anniversary and to remember a year of growth amidst hardship. Despite the wind and rain yesterday, many people still attended, which shows that there are still many people who are enthusiastic about education. Who says Shanghai doesn't have true art appreciation?

The velvet curtain of Lanxin was drawn open amidst the sounds of the piano. The first piece was a solo by Miss He Yu-lin, followed by Miss He Yu-liang's violin and Miss He Yu-zhen's solo singing. The constant applause proved the high level of artistic accomplishment of the three sisters.

Mr. Yang Zhu-lin sang a bass solo, accompanied by Mr. Huang Yong-xi, a famous orchestra conductor, followed by Miss Xu Zeng-sui's soprano solo, which was melodious and lingering. Jin Sangzi Zhou Xuan appeared as a guest performer, accompanied by the famous composer Mr. Chen Ge-xin, complementing each other perfectly. Miss Zhou sang two songs, "Unchanging Heart" and "Phoenix Flying," which greatly excited the audience.

The second part of the performance was Chinese music. The first program of Chinese music was a collective ensemble of "浔阳夜月" (Xunyang Nocturne), followed by Xie Xiao and Sun Yu-de playing "平沙落雁" (Wild Geese Descending on the Sandbank). The highlight was Mr. Sun Yu-de's [missing character] [missing character] solo of "[missing character] Yin Ping Chu".

Everyone who participated in the performance this time was doing it voluntarily and was extremely serious. This kind of enthusiasm for charity is truly admirable. (Huang Ye)
