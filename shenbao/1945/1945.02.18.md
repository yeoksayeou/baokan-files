### Japanese Air Force Claims 200 Enemy Planes Shot Down; Air Force Simultaneously Attacked Enemy Mobile Units

Tokyo, 17th (Central News Agency dispatch) - The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced at 3:30 PM on the 17th: (1) Starting at 7:00 AM today, enemy carrier-based aircraft continued their actions from the 16th, attacking the Kanto region and Shizuoka Prefecture. (2) On the 16th, enemy aircraft units approaching the Japanese mainland were intercepted. As of now, the confirmed results are: 147 enemy aircraft shot down, over 50 severely damaged, and one large warship set ablaze. The Japanese side lost 61 aircraft that failed to return, and damage on the ground was extremely minor.

Tokyo, 17th (Central News Agency dispatch) - An enemy American mobile unit approaching the Japanese mainland launched over a thousand carrier-based aircraft in total on the morning of the 16th, attacking the Japanese mainland for nine hours. The enemy mobile unit is still cruising near the coast. On the 17th, enemy carrier-based aircraft formations persistently attacked the Kanto region and Japanese Pacific coastal airfields in Shizuoka Prefecture.

Tokyo, 17th (Central News Agency dispatch) - Students of the Japanese Army Officer School in Kanagawa Prefecture shot down five enemy carrier-based aircraft attacking the area. Details are as follows: one shot down in the afternoon of the 16th, one at 8:00 AM on the 17th, and two around 10:00 AM on the 17th, one of which crashed straight down, emitting black smoke.

Tokyo, 17th (Central News Agency dispatch) - On the morning of the 16th, the Japanese air force surrounded and attacked an enemy mobile unit southeast of the Japanese mainland, severely damaging one large enemy warship (believed to be an aircraft carrier) of an unspecified type, causing a major fire. Furthermore, considerable damage was inflicted on other warships.

### Japanese Imperial Headquarters Announces War Results Around Iwo Jima: Five Enemy Warships Sunk; Enemy Troops Attempting to Land Repelled

Tokyo, 17th (Central News Agency dispatch) - The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced at 6:20 PM on the 17th: (1) Around 10:00 AM on the 17th, under cover of artillery bombardment, the enemy attempted to land on Iwo Jima. The Japanese garrison immediately repelled them. (2) Since the 16th, Japanese aircraft and garrison forces have attacked enemy warships around the island. Confirmed results are as follows: one battleship sunk, two cruisers sunk, two warships of unspecified type sunk, three landing transport ships destroyed, and ten aircraft shot down.

Tokyo, 17th (Central News Agency dispatch) - Enemy mobile units near Iwo Jima attempted to land on the Ninemoto Beach on the southwest coast of the island around 10:30 AM on the 17th. At that time, Japanese troops in that area immediately launched a fierce counterattack, driving the enemy forces back to the open sea. Shortly after, around 10:40 AM, the enemy changed direction and attempted to land on the Kamisato Beach on the southeast coast of the island. Japanese troops waiting in position inflicted heavy damage on these landing enemy forces and repelled them as well.

Tokyo, 17th (Central News Agency dispatch) - Since the 16th, a separate powerful fleet has been bombarding Iwo Jima with naval guns. Since the 17th, the bombardment of the island has become even more intense, with the intention of suppressing the Japanese garrison positions. The fleet attacking Iwo Jima seems to include transport convoys and landing craft carrying landing forces, and a considerably large convoy is prepared in the rear. This shows that the enemy's intention is to capture Iwo Jima. Since the fall of the Mariana Islands, Iwo Jima has become the most important forward defense line in the Pacific theater. Its strategic significance is both important and great. Observing these enemy actions clearly indicates that their wounds in the seas of Taiwan and the Philippines seem to have healed, and their ability to deploy such a large naval force is also due to the assistance of the British fleet sailing in the Pacific.

Japanese Troops Establish a Circular Stronghold on Iwo Jima

Iwo Jima, 17th (Central News Agency dispatch) - In an effort to invade the Japanese mainland and secure a nearby base, the American enemy has been relentlessly bombing Iwo Jima day and night since the beginning of this year. On the 16th of this month, the enemy's ambition to land on the island was finally exposed. Around 7:00 AM on the 16th, the enemy launched multiple waves of giant fighter planes and carrier-based "Kamikaze" bombers, followed by naval gun bombardment from the southern sea. At that time, the reporter stood on the observation platform at the central high ground of the island, observing the enemy's situation, and learned that the enemy's force consisted of about one aircraft carrier, battleships, cruisers, destroyers, transport ships, and dozens of other vessels. These ships were divided into southwest directions, each with three ships. At the time, dark clouds were densely covered, and there was occasional light rain. In this misty environment, around 1:00 PM, the enemy's naval gun bombardment became more intense. At this time, under its cover, thirteen small landing craft gradually approached the island from a distance of about four kilometers from the coast. Japanese soldiers immediately fired heavy artillery, fiercely attacking the enemy. Around 3:00 PM, the enemy finally retreated to a distance of 20,000 to 30,000 meters. This may have been a preliminary battle to scout landing points. Iwo Jima is an island with a total length of 8.3 kilometers and a maximum width of 4.2 kilometers, making it a small island of 20 square kilometers. Half of it is mountainous terrain. Japanese soldiers have dug a circular stronghold around the island, and the morale of the entire army is extremely high. If the fierce enemy takes one step closer to the island, they will immediately experience a painful blow from the Japanese army.

### Shigemitsu, Greater East Asia Minister, Sends Congratulatory Telegram for Bumper Harvest in Manchuria

Tokyo, 17th (Central News Agency dispatch) - This year's agricultural harvest in Manchuria is no less than last year's, and the procurement work is progressing exceptionally smoothly. By the end of last year, its procurement performance had already exceeded the annual procurement volume of the previous year. By mid-February, it had increased by 20% compared to last year. This year's procurement target should be greatly exceeded. This will make a great contribution to the food supply and demand of China, Japan, and Manchuria. Shigemitsu, the Japanese Minister of Greater East Asia, sent telegrams to Takebe, the Chief of General Affairs of Manchuria, and Huang Xing, the Minister of Agriculture, on the 6th, expressing congratulations and gratitude, and sincerely expressing respect for the efforts of the Manchurian officials and people.

### If the Enemy Invades Our Country's Territory, They Will Suffer Even Greater Damage; Ling Xiao's Views on the War Situation

Nanjing, 17th (Central News Agency dispatch) - The war in the Pacific has now reached the decisive stage. The American enemy, disregarding major strategic taboos, extended supply lines and invaded the hinterland of East Asia. Through the heroic interception by the allied naval, land, and air forces, the enemy has fallen into an irrecoverable abyss. The one billion people of East Asia, without exception, share a common hatred of the enemy and strengthen their belief in inevitable victory. Recently, the American Secretary of War Stimson declared that they would attempt to land on the Chinese mainland, which aroused even greater anger among our entire nation. Yesterday, a reporter from the Central News Agency specially visited Ling Xiao, the Minister of the Navy of the National Government, to inquire about his views on this decisive battle in the Pacific, what preparations the new Chinese Navy had made if the enemy landed on the Chinese mainland, and the current state of the navy's progress. Minister Ling provided detailed answers. The interview is recorded as follows:

The Allied Forces Have the Upper Hand in the Philippine Theater

(Question) Recently, the situation in the Philippine theater has become increasingly fierce. With the bloody battles fought by all officers and soldiers of the allied land, sea, and air forces, great victories have been achieved. What are the Minister's views on this?

(Answer) Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, allied naval and air officers and soldiers have fought bravely against the enemy. Over the past three years, their brilliant achievements have shocked the people of the world. This kind of resolute and outstanding spirit is deeply admired by us. The American enemy has suffered extremely heavy losses from these blows, leading to a daily shortage of military supplies. The difficulty of their supply and the decline in production have made it difficult for them to cope. Now, the enemy has further disregarded major strategic taboos, trudged a long way, and deeply invaded the hinterland of East Asia, which is indeed a great mistake. Modern warfare is not about the gain or loss of one place or one city, but about being able to persistently deplete the enemy's main force. Therefore, although they were fortunate enough to land and occupy some islands in the Pacific, from a military point of view, they have little value. Currently, Manila in Luzon has been invaded by the enemy, but the allied officers and soldiers on the periphery are giving them a head-on blow, implementing a "war of attrition." Furthermore, according to my observation, modern warfare places more emphasis on aircraft than warships. At present, the production of allied aircraft is making rapid progress, so the strength of the naval combat forces is becoming stronger and stronger. Moreover, the allied support base is nearby, which is clear evidence that the allied forces are in an absolutely advantageous position.

Our New Navy is Standing By, Ready for Battle

(Question) Recently, American Secretary of War Stimson declared that they will land on the Chinese mainland in the future. What are the Minister's views on this?

(Answer) After investigating the enemy's operations in Luzon, they have repeatedly stated that the future is quite difficult. If they want to fight on the Chinese mainland in the future, they will need even more time and more supplies. Furthermore, since the allied forces launched the mainland offensive last year, the American plan to fight on the Chinese coast has been clearly shattered. And judging by the current situation, the enemy is currently exhausted. If they deeply invade our territory, they will inevitably suffer even greater damage. At the same time, our new navy is also standing by, ready to cooperate with the Japanese army and give them a head-on blow. All of our naval officers and soldiers have a strong determination to kill the enemy.

### Chongqing-Yan'an Negotiations Stall Again

Lisbon, 17th (Central News Agency dispatch) - Negotiations for reconciliation between the Chongqing and Yan'an regimes have stalled again due to fundamental opposition between the two sides. Chongqing made concessions again on the 14th regarding the negotiations, but were rejected by Yan'an. The concessions had four points: (1) Recognition of the legal status of Yan'an. (2) Recognition of Yan'an representatives participating in the Military Commission. (3) To form a wartime cabinet, recognition of Yan'an and other party representatives participating in administration. (4) To review the supply and reorganization of the communist army, a committee would be organized by representatives from Yan'an, Chongqing, and the United States. According to telegrams from Chongqing, Zhou Enlai attacked the Chongqing regime when he left Chongqing, and many of his statements about the negotiations were inappropriate.

### Solving the People's Food Problem Requires Adequate Rationing: Opinions of Consulting Committee Member Feng Bingnan

"I have always been concerned about the people's food problem. Since May of last year, as the people's food situation became increasingly serious and people's livelihoods were increasingly threatened, I volunteered, despite my own weakness, to present a detailed outline of fundamental solutions to the people's food problem and discuss countermeasures with the former municipal authorities and relevant parties, and have repeatedly offered opinions. Now, for the sake of Mayor Zhou, Secretary-General Luo, and Director Liu of the Rationing Office being able to easily understand my humble opinions, I have specially selected and described the main points of the opinions I have put forward in July and August as follows:

Minimum Amount Required for Health

(1) The food control system is a measure that should be taken under the wartime system, but during the period of implementing control, the food rationing system must be implemented at the same time.

(2) The food control system is the right of the government to implement, and at the same time, the government should also fulfill its food rationing obligations. The so-called equality of rights and obligations, the two should not be neglected.

(3) The amount of food rationed should not be lower than the minimum amount required for the people's health, that is, the monthly or daily rationed amount must be equal to the minimum amount required for the people's health.

(4) The minimum amount required for the people's health. When I advocated the implementation of the rationing system to the former Public Works Bureau several years ago, I asked them to study the habits of our people and the minimum amount required for their health. As a result, they believed that each person needs one pound of rice per day on average per year. According to our country's weights and measures, each person needs about 1.8 dou per month. This has already been discounted based on the habits of our people. There is a folk proverb in our country that "big mouths and small mouths, three dou per month," which means that on average, each person needs three dou per month (see page 355 of Chinese Rural Economy). At the same time, it must also be taken into account that people who use physical labor consume a lot, and 1.8 dou per month is still far from sufficient.

Military Provisions and People's Food are Equally Important

(5) Under the wartime system, military provisions are certainly important, but people's food should also be given equal importance. Special priority rationing for military police and other public officials is undoubtedly beyond reproach, and the people dare not ask for anything extravagant in this regard. However, rationing at the minimum amount required for health should be the priority of priorities. Before implementing priority rationing, it is necessary to ensure that the minimum needs of the general public and military police are adequately rationed before it can be implemented. Due to the need to survive, the people have no choice but to demand equal treatment for the rationing of the minimum amount of food they need.

(6) Whether in times of war or peace, the health of the people is closely related to the survival of the nation. Protecting the survival of the people is the primary task of any country. Even prisoners who have been sentenced to death by the state law, the state still has the responsibility to provide for them before their execution.

Insufficient Rationing Affects

(7) Since the implementation of the control system in this city, the amount of food rationed has never been sufficient to meet the minimum needs of the people, causing the powerful to flock to the black market to replenish, which has led to soaring black market prices. In addition, the rationing date is often inaccurate, and there are occasional delays without supplementary rationing, which creates more opportunities for the black market to be rampant. As a result, farmers seek better prices and tend to sell on the black market, which greatly affects the procurement work of the control agency.

(8) The success or failure of food control depends entirely on whether the amount of food rationed is sufficient or not, which is its most important key.

(9) Assuming that the 1.8 dou per month per person that I have always advocated is implemented, I firmly believe that although the black market cannot be completely eliminated, its threat to people's livelihoods and its hindrance to the function of control will be greatly reduced.

(10) The country's food policy should adopt a policy of high grain prices for farmers and a policy of low grain prices for the people. What is a policy of high grain prices? That is, to increase procurement prices, adding a legal profit in addition to considering the cost of farmers, in order to encourage their production. What is a policy of low grain prices? That is, to suppress rationing prices, taking into account the purchasing power of the general public, and strive to make it sufficient to maintain the lives of individuals and their families, so as to avoid freezing and starvation. The difference between the two should be compensated by taxes. If it can be successfully promoted, it will surely achieve the effect of national wealth and a strong people.

(11) The procurement of food should implement a unified system. There are too many units of procurement personnel from the control association. During wartime, there are few sellers of food and many seekers, and supply and demand cannot be balanced. How can rice prices not rise?

Rationing of Other Necessities

(12) Other items such as fuel oil and salt are also daily necessities. Once they have been controlled, they must be rationed. Now, coal and oil have not been rationed for a long time, and even if they are rationed, the quantity is still very small. Salt has never been rationed even once.

(13) Water is also an indispensable item for the people. During wartime, there may be a shortage of raw materials needed for water production, but the amount of water used by the people cannot be restricted too low, especially for the so-called alley houses, where there are many households and a large population. Too low a water restriction not only greatly affects the health of the people, but also falls far short of the tasks that public utilities themselves should fulfill, which is very regrettable.

(14) Since the supply of fuel coal is scarce, other fuels such as firewood and charcoal should be rationed. The importance of fuel and water is equal. Without either, people can hardly survive. If there is a shortage of coal, other fuels such as firewood and charcoal should be supplied to meet the people's living needs first, and the use of industry and transportation equipment should be strictly prohibited.

Summarizing the Opinions Held

Now, the above points are summarized as follows:

(1) Minimum needs.

(2) Other controlled goods should be rationed as soon as possible.

(3) The price of rationed goods should take into account the purchasing power of the general public.

(4) Food rationing must be on time.

(5) Fuel should be supplied to meet the people's living needs first.

(6) Food procurement should be unified.

(7) Before implementing priority rationing, the general public should first obtain the minimum amount required for health.

### Fierce Fighting Unfolds on the South Side of Corregidor; Japanese Army in Manila Resists Fiercely

Philippine Base, 17th (Central News Agency dispatch) - Enemy naval and air forces fiercely bombarded and bombed Corregidor Island several times. On the morning of the 16th, an enemy airborne force suddenly landed on Corregidor Island. In response, dozens of enemy landing craft also landed with enemy troops. Currently, fierce fighting is taking place on the south side of the island.

Zurich, 17th (Central News Agency dispatch) - Macworth’s announcement on the 15th acknowledged that the Japanese army's resistance in the Manila battle was extremely fierce.

Weekly Commentary

### Impressions of Attending the Advisory Council Meeting

— Chen Binhe

Yesterday, the Municipal Advisory Council held its 13th plenary committee meeting. Since Mayor Zhou took office, the Advisory Council has convened one temporary plenary meeting to discuss the purchase of 100,000 piculs of affordable rice. Mayor Zhou did not attend due to official business. Therefore, yesterday's plenary meeting was also the first time Mayor Zhou attended the Advisory Council's plenary meeting. Therefore, the colleagues who attended felt particularly hopeful.

Mayor Zhou delivered a report at the meeting (the full text can be found on the second edition of this newspaper today). The report lasted a full hour, and from beginning to end, the atmosphere was tense. From start to finish, he did not relax for a single moment. Mayor Zhou is still recovering from a new illness, and by the latter half of his speech, he was sweating profusely. When he spoke of touching points, the speaker almost shed tears, and the listeners were also deeply moved. Therefore, I think this report should not only be read carefully by all citizens, but I also hope that the current authorities of the allied nations can take the time to read it.

This report is divided into two main parts: one is about internal rectification, and the other is about the focus of facilities. Whether it is internal rectification or the focus of facilities, it can be said that they are all very concise, very practical, and very frank. Standing from the perspective of citizens, we wholeheartedly support them. The first point of the report on internal rectification is to reduce the organization, based on the principle of simplification, merging and cutting back. However, two additional agencies should be added as needed: one is the County Administration Office, and the other is the Population Evacuation Committee. This further indicates that the reduction of organizations and the establishment of organizations are entirely based on factual needs, and are by no means superficial decorations. The County Administration Office is a dedicated management agency to promote the city's counties, which is essential to strengthen the outer perimeter. The newspaper's editorials have repeatedly pointed this out, such as the article "Promoting the Model Area of the Seven Counties of Shanghai" on July 28 last year, "Sincere Talk about the Current Situation of the County Areas of the City and Subsequent Thoughts" on September 18, and "The Seven Counties of Shanghai Should be Adjusted" on January 23 of this year, consistently arguing for the importance of the city's county administration. Secondly, the issue of evacuating the population is an urgent requirement of the current situation, and it is also necessary to establish a special committee to preside over the matter. The newspaper's editorials have also discussed this several times, such as the article "The Problem of Shanghai Population Evacuation" on December 26 of last year, "Livelihood Issues and Population Evacuation" on January 14 of this year, "The First Thing in the New Year" on February 4, and "Population Evacuation and Restriction of Entry" on February 15, all emphasizing the necessity of evacuation and the steps to be taken. Observing from these places, the public opinion and the government's policies have already achieved a unified direction, which is a very gratifying thing.

Mayor Zhou quoted what Zeng Wenzheng said: "What the state and county consider small matters are the big matters of the people." This is a demonstration of making a fresh start with the people and sympathizing with their difficulties. Simply put, municipal administration is about serving the citizens. Therefore, it is necessary to pay attention to the lives of the citizens and alleviate their suffering. The most important thing is to stabilize people's livelihoods. From the citizens' point of view, they should of course save resources, and all clothing, food, and other daily necessities should be economized as much as possible. From the government's point of view, it should do its best to provide the minimum satisfaction. At the same time, it is hoped that the authorities of the allied nations can also provide the greatest cooperation.

The report also said: "To do a cause, the first thing is to think of a way, the second thing is to have a way, and the third thing is to make it work." I think that the points of focus of facilities listed by Mayor Zhou in the report have fully demonstrated that he has achieved the first step of thinking of a way and the second step of having a way. The question that remains is how to make it work. I believe that the municipal government is determined to make it work, and the citizens will also be determined to cooperate in making it work. At the same time, if we can get the greatest cooperation from the current authorities of the allied nations, we will definitely achieve the goal of making it work, and there will be nothing that cannot be done. However, in recent times, it cannot be said that there have been innovations in all aspects of municipal administration. However, the most fundamental problem of stabilizing people's livelihoods has not been solved. In other words, if the most important issue of rice and grain in people's livelihoods cannot be properly resolved, then all talk of stabilizing people's livelihoods will be nothing more than empty words, and the distance to eliminating the suffering of the citizens will be even greater.

We consistently advocate that the military should be the first priority at present, but in order to achieve the goal of military first, we cannot ignore the responsibility of politics. If we can achieve the minimum level of stability in people's livelihoods, then politics can play a role and military affairs can achieve twice the result with half the effort. Otherwise, even if it is not a waste of effort, it will certainly be a case of getting half the result with twice the effort. We hope that the wise authorities of China and Japan will fully reflect on this and fully cooperate to move towards the most correct goal.

### Memorial Stone to Be Erected Before the Tomb of Late Chairman Wang; Central Standing Committee Resolution Passed

Nanjing, Central News Agency dispatch, 17th: Today, the 17th, marks the hundredth day of mourning for the late Chairman Wang. The Central Standing Committee resolved to collect funds to erect a stone memorial archway at his tomb and to solicit plum blossoms to be planted around the tomb, as an expression of mourning. As Chairman Wang's burial proceeded, comrades and family members strictly adhered to his last words, that those who wished to commemorate him could plant a few plum trees around the tomb. Therefore, Chairman Wang's burial was managed entirely by his family, and no national funds were used in the construction of the tomb. This is both the comrades' adherence to Chairman Wang's last words and the fulfillment of his great wish. However, Chairman Wang led the comrades in revolution for decades, and his sudden demise caused grief throughout the world. Although the comrades勉遵(reluctantly obey) his last words, they deeply desired to have some form of memorial. Recently, comrades have been requesting to raise funds to erect a stone memorial archway in front of Chairman Wang's tomb, as an expression of mourning. Therefore, on the 9th of this month, the Central Standing Committee resolved that comrades should freely contribute funds to expedite this project. However, considering that there are hundreds of thousands of comrades in the party, to prevent any one person from donating excessively and potentially causing regret for their dependents, it was specifically resolved that each person's donation should not exceed ten thousand yuan. It is hoped that every comrade can fulfill their admiration. Furthermore, comrades who have white, red, green, or light red plum blossoms and wish to donate them to be planted around Chairman Wang's tomb may notify the Secretariat of the Central Party Headquarters so that they can be transplanted at a specific time.

### Battle for Breslau Begins; Street Fighting in Sagan

Berlin, Central News Agency dispatch, 17th: Hsin Tung News Agency reports: The battle for Breslau has begun. Soviet forces are launching multiple local advances from the west and east. It appears that after concentrating troops around Breslau, the Soviet forces have decided to engage in a decisive battle to seize the city. Soviet forces are currently heavily shelling the German defense lines there. Only on the western side of Breslau, after heavy shelling, have Soviet forces managed to break into the village of Kleintinz. Southeast of Liegnitz, the Soviet forces attempted to break into the German defense positions yesterday but were heavily repulsed by the German forces.

Schmottseifen and Sorau remain in German hands. In Sagan (on the east bank of the Queis River), street fighting is ongoing, and German forces are advancing southward from the Schmottseifen area. On the Queis River front, Soviet attempts to cross the river have only succeeded in one location and have been repulsed by German forces.

### Preparations for the Defense of Berlin Completed

Berlin, Central News Agency dispatch, 17th: Hsin Tung News Agency reports: Although Berlin is not as critical as it was ten days ago, its defenses have not been relaxed in the slightest. Last night, Lieutenant General Ernst, commander of the 3rd Military District of Berlin, broadcast that Berlin and its front lines have been divided into several defense zones, using lakes, hills, and canals as natural barriers. The people's defense forces are organized by the Party Headquarters. Plans for disseminating information are in place in case newspapers cannot be published. Preparations for cutting off gas and electricity have also been completed. Women and children in Berlin are unable to evacuate. When the war reaches Berlin, both men and women must work in factories.

### Consultative Council Plenary Session: Mayor Presents Report; General Assembly Suggests Maintaining Rice Rationing

The 13th Plenary Session of the Municipal Consultative Council, originally scheduled for the beginning of this month, was postponed due to Mayor Zhou's ill health. It was held yesterday (the 17th) at 4 PM in the City Hall conference room. Council members Li Sihao, Yan Huiqing, Wen Lanting, Zhao Jinqing, Lin Kanghou, Wu Yunzhai, Jin Xiongbai, Dai Ailu, Li Zhishi, Fei Yunqing, Zhu Boquan, Chen Riping, Chen Binhe, Yao Qingsan, Feng Bingnan, Shen Siliang, Wang Renlin, and over thirty others attended. Mayor Zhou and Secretary-General Luo, along with heads of various bureaus and departments, were present. The session was chaired by Li Sihao. First, Mayor Zhou reported on the City Government's central tasks from February to June of this year. Then, Li Sihao reported on the City Government's additional appointment of Ye Fuxiao, Wang Renlin, Xu Jianping, Zhang Deqin, and Xu Weizhen as consultative council members. Subsequently, the following motions were discussed: (1) A suggestion to maintain household rice rationing, ensuring it is not delayed or reduced, to maintain the people's food supply. Measures: (1) The Rice Control Committee should designate the locations for storing rationed rice for Shanghai, and the City Government should handle the transportation (by waterway or by rail). (2) Six months should be designated as a key period for implementing and testing focused rationing. During this period, general rationing should also be maintained on time and in the correct quantity. After implementing focused rationing, those not subject to focused rationing should be able to purchase rice at a fair price. The resolution was passed and a letter will be sent to the City Government to consult with relevant agencies. (2) The motion to evacuate students from schools in the city, urging the Education Bureau to prepare in advance, and the motion to reduce the city's population by limiting the entry of people from other areas were discussed together. The resolution was approved in principle and passed to the Standing Committee for review.

### Secretary-General Luo Explains Measures to Suppress Prices; Gives Talk While Receiving Japanese Press Corps

City Government Secretary-General Luo received a Japanese press corps from the local Shanghai Japanese-language newspaper at 11:30 AM yesterday (the 17th) and gave a talk on measures to suppress prices and implement administrative streamlining, saying:

Countermeasures for Suppressing Prices

(1) The City Government will follow the central government's regulations and policies to suppress prices. The new price limits for the sixteen major commodities set by the Price Review Committee will soon be announced. The City Government is also planning to negotiate with relevant parties to find ways to open up sources of supplies along the railway lines. This is currently being planned. In the future, those who artificially drive up prices will be severely punished.

Levying Special Consumption Tax on Racecourses

(2) The special consumption tax on the city's Jai Alai and dog racing venues has been levied since February 1st. The City Government will implement skillful methods of collecting this tax. It has also requested the Ministry of Finance to transfer the collection of the special consumption tax on horse racing to the City Government.

Merger of Public Utilities Bureau and Public Works Bureau

(3) Due to frequent conflicts of authority between the Public Utilities Bureau and the Public Works Bureau in the past, it has been decided to merge them from March 1st to achieve administrative streamlining. The new bureau will be named the Construction Bureau. It is rumored that the position of director will be assumed by Xu Jitun, the current director of the Public Utilities Bureau. Therefore, the City Government's reorganization of institutions and implementation of administrative streamlining will be completed within February.

### Director Liu of the North Station Police Bureau Discusses Work Guidelines

In order to thoroughly eliminate illegal elements at the North Station and fundamentally improve order, thereby ensuring the safety and convenience of legitimate travelers, the City Police Bureau has established the Shanghai Branch Bureau at 29 Jiaotong Road. All parties have high expectations for this. Yesterday, reporters visited the branch bureau's director, Liu Zhenzhong, and deputy director, Takura Shigeo, who received them and announced the bureau's future work guidelines. The poor conduct of Shanghai station police, railway employees, and others in the past has aroused resentment among citizens. At the beginning of the branch bureau's establishment, it will uphold a spirit of self-discipline and self-restraint, eliminating past injustices and establishing the Shanghai station as a true station for the people. No matter what obstacles are encountered, it will strive to eliminate them in order to achieve its goals. Regarding internal rectification: (1) Strictly prevent police officers from accepting bribes, engaging in illegal extortion, and other misconduct, and strengthen supervision and guidance. (2) Strictly enforce police discipline. Regarding external rectification: (1) Crack down on the misconduct of railway employees, (2) Crack down on black market train tickets, (3) Crack down on smuggling of prohibited and controlled goods, (4) Crack down on "ticket scalpers," prohibit irrelevant people from entering and exiting the station, and secretly investigate people loitering near the station to eliminate all illegal intentions, (5) Strictly prevent theft and smuggling of goods within the station.

### Discount Rice for Private Schools: Deadline for Payment Tomorrow

Seventy private schools have yet to collect payment slips for the first batch of discount rice rations. School representatives must bring their school seals to Room 306, Jing'an Building, 749 Jing'an Temple Road, before 5 PM today (the 18th) to collect their slips. Rice payments must be made to the designated bank before 12 PM on Monday, the 19th. Late payments will be considered an automatic waiver.

### Citizens Can Report Inferior Household Matches

The Shanghai District Match and Soap Rationing Office of the Daily Necessities Control Committee has recently discovered that some retailers are selling inferior matches with the "Hundred Deer" brand distributed through the Consolidated Ticket No. 38. These retailers are mixing inferior matches or broken sticks into the matchboxes, or deliberately reducing the number of matches in the boxes, causing losses to citizens. Therefore, it is hoped that citizens who discover such situations will report the retailer's name and address and the circumstances to the office. If the reports are verified, severe punishment will be imposed.

Extension Deadline

The household match rationing for Ticket No. 38 issued by the City Goods Rationing Office was originally scheduled to end on the 10th of this month. However, to facilitate citizens during the Spring Festival, it was extended to the 20th of this month. As the deadline is approaching, it is hoped that citizens will not delay further, as no further extensions will be granted after this deadline.

After an introduction by Liu Dexuan, Director of the Propaganda Department, Director Liu reported on the internal organizational adjustments of the office and the significance of establishing a rationing system, and answered questions from reporters regarding various rationing issues.

Focused Rationing Already Implemented

(1) (Question) When will focused rationing be implemented? Will other items besides rice, such as flour, oil, sugar, and coal briquettes, be included? (Answer) Focused rice rationing was implemented in January. The inclusion of other items such as flour, oil, sugar, and coal briquettes depends on the availability of supplies.

Household Rice to Be Rationed Soon

(2) (Question) Household rice has not been rationed for several periods, leading to rumors of a halt to rationing, which is causing anxiety among the general public. Can it be expected that it will be rationed as usual soon? Will the quantity be increased or decreased? (Answer) There is no truth to the rumor that household rice rationing will be stopped. However, due to transportation difficulties, we are doing our best to resolve them. If supplies can be transported soon, they will be rationed as usual, and the quantity should not be reduced.

Negotiations Underway for Rationing Daily Necessities

(3) (Question) In the past, the rationing of general daily necessities in the city has often not been implemented on schedule. How does your office plan to adjust this in the future? (Answer) We are currently negotiating with relevant parties to adjust the rationing of daily necessities.

### Rice Control Committee Rations Discounted Goods to Farmers

In order to encourage farmers to pay rice and actively promote procurement, the Rice Control Committee has formulated preferential measures for farmers. Farmers in all regions who pay one shi (approximately 133 lbs) of brown rice or white rice, or two hundred jin (approximately 266 lbs) of rice paddy, will receive a four-part voucher. With the voucher, they can obtain one of the following discounted goods from the rationing offices in each district. More goods can be rationed for larger payments: (1) Five jin of cooking oil, 500 yuan, (2) Thirty small boxes of matches, 500 yuan, (3) Twenty-five jin of vegetable cakes, 500 yuan, (4) Twelve jin of fertilizer powder, 500 yuan, (5) Six bars of soap, 500 yuan.

Development of Money Shops

The Money Shop Guild reported that 134 major settlement money shops were listed during last year's Lunar New Year, while this year the number has increased to as many as 223. The number of newly established money shops has increased by 89 compared to last year, indicating an unprecedentedly prosperous development of the money shop industry. It is reported that the shops separately sent representatives to report their listing to the guild around 9 AM on the 17th, and held a fellow worship ceremony in the market. Immediately after, the opening foreign exchange rate was set at six jiao, which was five fen lower than the closing rate at the end of last year. By 9:45 AM, 210 money shops were listed, and the remaining new shops had all reported their listing by around 10 AM. No shops were reorganized, closed, or liquidated. The work of exchanging notes in the market was completed within the time prescribed for Saturdays. The money reserve bank and the industry guild also resumed normal office operations from that day.

### First Report to the Shanghai Special Municipality Municipal Advisory Committee

— Zhou Fo Hai

The Advisory Committee was originally scheduled to be held on the 3rd, but was temporarily suspended due to my illness. I fully expected to recover in a few days, so it was rescheduled for the 10th. Little did I know that my condition would worsen in the interim, and it had to be postponed until today. I am truly very sorry.

In the past, the Advisory Committee has been very cooperative and helpful to the Municipal Government, and I deeply admire that. As the situation becomes more serious and the work becomes more difficult, more and greater efforts will be required. Therefore, I hope that the Advisory Committee will cooperate even more than in the past.

Regarding the future policy and spirit of administration, I have already mentioned them in my public notice to the citizens, so I will not repeat them. Today, I will briefly report on the work to be done between February and June, a period of five months. Detailed outlines are explained in the work plans of each bureau and department. Now, I will only explain the important points, which are our central tasks.

My report is divided into two parts: internal rectification of the municipal government and the key points of general facilities.

Four Key Points for Internal Rectification

Regarding internal rectification, the first is to reduce the size of the organization. In the past, the Municipal Government was formed by the merger of three parties, so the organization was very large and complex. This not only wasted funds, but also reduced the ability to handle affairs, obscured responsibilities, and unclear authority. People would compete for advantages but would defer to one another when problems arose. Moreover, a single official matter often had to be stamped by more than a dozen people before it could be issued. Such laxity and delay could not cope with the current rapidly changing situation. Therefore, the organization must be simplified. For example, the merger of the Public Works Bureau and the Engineering Bureau into the Construction Bureau, the unification of the three treasuries into one, the transformation of the Special Consumption Tax Office and the General Accounting Office into departments, the merger of various departments of the Police Bureau, the abolition of the Land and Housing Management Committee for Owners Not Present and the Property Management Committee for Chongqing Assets, and the elimination or merger of various departments and sections of other bureaus and offices are all based on this principle. However, two new organizations are being added contrary to this need: the County Administration Office and the Population Evacuation Committee. In the past, the counties under the jurisdiction of Shanghai Municipality did not have a dedicated management agency, which made it impossible to advance county administration, so a special office was established to promote it. Evacuating the population is an urgent matter at present, but the work is arduous, so a committee must be established to oversee it. However, for the two new organizations, the number of people used by the County Administration Office is limited to a very small extent, and the people who handle affairs for the Population Evacuation Committee are entirely seconded.

The second is to eliminate unnecessary redundant staff. In the current urgent situation, it stands to reason that two people should eat one person's meal, and one person should do the work of two people. Although we are reluctant to ask or force two people to eat one person's meal, we very much hope that one person will do the work of two people. The Municipal Government now has too many staff, on the contrary, two people do one person's work, or even three people do one person's work, and there are still people who have nothing to do. The total number of people in the Municipal Government, according to the approved quota, is 42,930. Among them, in addition to more than 15,000 in the Police Bureau and more than 11,000 in the Security Command, there are more than 15,900 other personnel. With so many people, there are of course many who have nothing to do. If an organization has many people who have nothing to do, the overall spirit will inevitably be lax, and discipline will inevitably be neglected. As for wasting huge sums of money, that is secondary. In order to improve administrative efficiency, save money, and increase the treatment of capable personnel, it is planned to gradually reduce the original number by one-third. We know very well that this move will inevitably cause many disputes and reactions, but we have made a great determination to implement it.

The third is to enforce discipline. This can be divided into two points: to prohibit corruption and to rectify morale. There is no need to go into detail about the past discipline. In the future, we plan to closely monitor the actions of civil servants. If we find anyone who uses their power to engage in malpractice for personal gain, they will be handed over to the Special Court or the Security Command for punishment under military law. However, Shanghai is a den of all evils, and we know that many civil servants do not solicit bribes, but the other party offers bribes to entice them. In the future, we will adhere to the principle of punishing both givers and receivers. Those who offer bribes will also be dealt with under military law. As for rectifying morale, the goal is to handle affairs quickly and to fundamentally eliminate the habit of not discussing conditions and delaying official business. Other habits of procrastination and shelving must also be thoroughly corrected. If an organization does not handle affairs quickly, it will cause great suffering to subordinate organizations, especially to the people. Zeng Wenzhenggong said: "What the state and county consider minor matters are major matters for the people." If the responsible personnel lightly shelve the people's requests, it will cause great inconvenience or loss to the people. In the future, the Secretariat will designate special personnel to assess the speed of handling official business in various bureaus and offices in order to ensure promptness.

The fourth is to improve treatment. To ensure the integrity of civil servants, it is necessary to improve their treatment, which need not be discussed further. In the future, we will do our best to improve the treatment of civil servants as much as our financial resources allow. However, I must frankly say that the speed and extent of the improvement in treatment will never keep up with the speed and extent of price increases. The amount of the increase will certainly not be as much as the money obtained through corruption. But we will certainly do our best to improve it. It has now been decided that the lowest monthly ration for civil servants is three dou of rice, with a salary of more than 18,000 yuan. The lowest monthly ration for unmarried police officers in the urban area is two and a half dou of rice, with a salary of more than 12,000 yuan. Because prices are lower in the suburbs and rural areas, the lowest monthly ration for soldiers in the Security Team is three dou of rice, with a salary of 5,000 yuan. With such increases, we know very well that it cannot be considered adequate, but it has already taken a great deal of effort. As a result, the total monthly increase in salaries and rice prices has reached more than 700 million yuan. If prices rise too much in the future, we are prepared to gradually increase them.

Focus of General Facilities

The above is a report on the key points of internal rectification of the Municipal Government. Now, I will report on the focus of general facilities.

The first is to reorganize finances. To improve the treatment of civil servants and to carry out undertakings, money is indispensable. Therefore, if there is no way to manage finances, nothing can be started from the ground up. However, I am unwilling to suddenly increase the burden on the people too much. Therefore, the first thing to do is to eliminate embezzlement. The amount of money that the people have already paid but the government has not received in the past is truly astonishing. If all the embezzled money goes to the government, the burden on the people will not increase, but the government's revenue will increase. The second is to strictly prohibit tax evasion. Cunning merchants often use clever methods to evade the taxes they should pay. In the future, we will conduct strict investigations, both overt and covert, to ensure that tax evasion is prohibited. Recently, several entertainment venues were found to have evaded taxes and have been fined leniently. In the future, they will be severely punished. This is not to increase the burden on the people, but to require the people not to evade the obligation to pay taxes. In this regard, there can also be a considerable increase in revenue. The recent increase in special consumption tax in the past three weeks has demonstrated the effect of reorganization. The third is to adjust tax rates. In the past, because many tax rates were not uniform or reasonable, tax collectors and taxpayers could collude, or taxpayers felt inconvenient, which resulted in a decrease in revenue. In the future, we will unify tax categories that are not uniform, such as those in the old one and eight districts, and we will submit requests to the central government to adjust tax rates that are not in line with the current situation, such as the banquet tax rate. Tax rates such as property tax and land tax should also be adjusted to reflect the current situation. Adjusting tax rates can also increase revenue. The fourth is to introduce new taxes. The increase in expenditure is too large, and the increase in revenue from the above three methods alone cannot make up for it. Therefore, it is necessary to introduce new taxes. The business tax that the former mayor planned to introduce in the old one and eight districts this spring is still in progress, and taxes such as advertising tax are also being planned. In short, in terms of finance, we strive for a balance between revenue and expenditure and do not want to have a deficit.

The second is to stabilize people's livelihood. I have no confidence in how much of this task can be achieved. Because to stabilize people's livelihood, it is necessary to stabilize prices and ensure sufficient distribution. However, to achieve these two goals, the municipal government must have a considerable amount of materials in its hands. Otherwise, it is impossible to achieve the goals. Some citizens do not understand this principle. They blame the municipal government for the high price of rice, for the failure to distribute goods on time, and for the reduction in electricity supply. These things are also the responsibility of the municipal government. However, everyone knows that the municipal government is empty-handed. The purchase of materials is not under the control of the municipal government, the distribution of materials is not under the control of the municipal government, the transportation of materials is not under the control of the municipal government, and the storage of materials is not under the control of the municipal government. Even if the municipal authorities have a sincere heart, they are really just empty-handed. With a sincere heart and a pair of empty hands, how can they lower prices and ensure full and timely distribution? Unless they have the ability to turn stone into gold, even gods have no way. All we can do is pitifully implore various material control agencies to dredge up sources of supply, to allocate goods to us on time, and not to raise distribution prices excessively. But here, despite our best efforts to speak and beg, the control agencies with authority also state their difficult reasons and cannot agree to our requests. The municipal government cannot perform magic and has no ability to create something out of nothing. What can we do? Therefore, being blamed by the citizens is really unfair. In the days before and after I took office, the price of rice stabilized slightly, and everyone attributed it to me, saying that the price of rice fell because I became the mayor. This was a coincidence and was definitely not my credit. I would never dare to take the credit of heaven as my own. The other day, the price of rice suddenly rose. If the responsibility for this is to be borne entirely by the empty-handed municipal government, it would be too harsh.

However, we will never shirk our responsibility. In the past, there have been cases where prices have soared due to improper measures taken by the municipal government, and there have also been cases where the distribution of goods has been delayed or deducted. We have the responsibility and the power to correct these malpractices. Therefore, although we cannot actively improve the lives of citizens because we are empty-handed, we will certainly strive to reduce or even eliminate unnecessary burdens, losses, and suffering suffered by citizens.

Resolutely Preventing Artificially Inflated Prices

During wartime, rising prices are inevitable. No country can prevent it. However, in addition to natural economic reasons, there are also artificial manipulation reasons in Shanghai. Therefore, the rise in prices is particularly drastic. For example, if prices should rise to ten due to natural reasons, they rise to a hundred or several hundred in Shanghai due to artificial reasons. Also, if prices should rise once a month due to natural reasons, they rise once every ten days or eight days, or even three days or five days in Shanghai due to artificial reasons. Because the municipal government is just empty-handed, it is frankly at a loss when it comes to price increases caused by natural and irresistible reasons. However, we are determined to make efforts to prevent price increases caused by artificial reasons. For example, if prices should only rise to ten, they will not be allowed to rise to a hundred or several hundred. If prices should only rise once a month, they will not be allowed to rise once every seven days or eight days, or three days or five days. The first thing we need to do is to improve the Price Review Committee. The past review committee was not an agency to prevent price increases, but an agency to promote price increases. Merchants and responsible personnel could collude to raise the official price. For example, before the new and old economic bureaus took over, they fired a lot of parting shots, perhaps raising the prices of some goods above what the merchants in the industry hoped for. This type of situation must be eliminated in the future. We plan to invite fair and honest experts to participate in the review, and we will also strictly select and supervise administrative personnel to ensure that the Price Review Committee can play a role in suppressing and stabilizing prices. The second thing to do is to register goods and their movements to prevent hoarding. Frankly speaking, hoarding and speculation are the main artificial reasons for rising prices. In the future, if such a situation is investigated, we will punish those who are seriously involved under military law for the benefit of the majority of citizens. However, in the past, many economic police or economic bureau personnel who investigated factories and shops took the opportunity to demand bribes. The government's investigation of an item provides these people with an opportunity to profit. Therefore, the citizens did not benefit from the crackdown on hoarding or the investigation of prices, but these people benefited first. In the future, this type of behavior will be strictly prohibited. Once discovered, both givers and receivers will be punished. Those who are seriously involved will be shot without mercy. It is my character that I will definitely carry out what I say. I am not trying to scare people. However, I am afraid that my eyes and ears are not everywhere and I cannot discover everything. I hope that the members of the Advisory Committee can secretly help to report, and I also hope that the general public will be responsible for reporting. The names of informers will be kept absolutely secret. However, we will not accept irresponsible anonymous letters. The third is to reorganize the various industry associations. If the various industry associations are sound, they can also use autonomous methods to make their members self-disciplined. Otherwise, they can use the collective actions of the associations to monopolize and speculate. Therefore, strengthening trade associations is also an indispensable means of suppressing prices. In short, we want to eradicate artificially inflated prices, and we want to earnestly implement the various laws and regulations promulgated by the central government to suppress prices, especially the emergency measures for price control promulgated on the 12th of this month.

Regarding distribution, the general public certainly hopes that the amount will be increased and that the distribution will be on time. Not only do the citizens hope so, but we also hope so and are working hard to achieve it. However, the municipal government itself has nothing. As I said before, it is empty-handed. Therefore, we can only make the greatest efforts to negotiate with the parties that own and distribute materials, asking them to increase the amount and issue it on time. As for whether we can do it, the power does not lie with the municipal government, so we cannot guarantee it. However, we will distribute the materials received from all parties in the most prompt and fair manner. We will not allow delays, demands, deductions, or adulteration. The municipal government will distribute as much as it receives to the citizens. We will refuse extra distribution to powerful people without regard for their feelings. Because the amount is fixed, if powerful people get more distribution, it will inevitably reduce the distribution that ordinary citizens should get. This kind of unfair thing is absolutely not allowed. If there is any malpractice in distribution, we also hope that the members of the Advisory Committee will help to report it, and we also hope that the general public will be responsible for reporting it.

Establishing Security in Urban and Rural Areas

The third is to maintain law and order. To maintain law and order, we must first ensure that the military and police responsible for maintaining law and order do not harass the people themselves. If this minimum requirement cannot be met, what else is there to talk about in terms of peace and security? But in the past, the people were not only afraid of bandits, but also afraid of the military and police. Sometimes, they were even more afraid of the military and police than of bandits. They thought that if they were robbed by illegal bandits, they could still sue. But if they were extorted by bandits in legal clothing, they would not dare to sue, because the military and police who were sued would take revenge in the future. So they suffered in silence and dared not speak out. Under these circumstances, why does the country need the military and police, and why do the people need the military and police? Therefore, to maintain law and order, we must first rectify the discipline of the military and police. After this considerable improvement in treatment, we will severely punish military and police who demand bribes to ensure the peace of society. I am very happy and comforted that the police officers in the urban area are very self-respecting and self-restrained. The phenomenon of extortion along the way has been very rare recently. I would like to take this opportunity to express my gratitude to the members of the Advisory Committee for raising huge sums of money to reward them. As a leader, it is naturally very pleasant to see his subordinates making such progress. However, we must first make sure that this good phenomenon continues, and second, we must extend it to the suburbs and rural areas.

Now, due to the situation, the law and order situation in the suburbs, especially in the rural areas, is deteriorating day by day. Therefore, strengthening the strength of the military and police is also something that must be done at present. I adopt the principle of elite soldiers, not seeking an increase in quantity, but seeking soundness in quality. On the one hand, we are eliminating unnecessary military and police adjutants and subordinates. At the same time, we must strengthen the training of police officers who actually perform the responsibility of maintaining law and order, and supplement the combat troops who actually fight. For the law and order in the urban area, we will assign the police to conduct open and secret investigations to prevent and control incidents before they happen. If an incident does occur, we will definitely assign them to solve the case within a short period of time after the incident. For the bandits and scattered bandits in the suburbs and rural areas, we will assign security teams and security police teams to gradually eliminate them. In the future, we will adhere to the principle of law and order first, strengthen the training of the military and police, strengthen the strength of the military and police, and give full play to the power of the military and police. Within the possible scope, we will make the greatest efforts to accomplish the task of establishing law and order.

Improving the Blockade Management Office

The fourth is to improve the Blockade Management Office. In the past, the extortion of the people by this office was worse than the likin in the past. It was heavily exploited and there were no standards. The villagers had suffering and had no way to complain. Originally, we planned to completely abolish the blockade, but the negotiations with the relevant parties have not yet been completed. Now, we want to reduce the number of people in the blockade office to the minimum, and also improve their treatment and strictly monitor them. If there are lawbreakers, they will be imprisoned for minor offenses and executed for serious offenses, in order to reduce the suffering of the people.

The above is a report on the key tasks for the next five months. As for other matters such as the reorganization and strengthening of education, the promotion of public health, the reorganization of urban traffic and city appearance, the repair and dredging of roads and ditches, the reorganization of land, and the implementation of social welfare and publicity activities, each bureau and office has a written plan outline report, so there is no need to make an oral report here one by one.

In the future, we will lead all members of the Municipal Government to carry out the established plans step by step. However, in such a serious, complex, and delicate environment, I am not fully confident that we can achieve the expected results. I also said at the last tea party to welcome people from all walks of life that in such a situation, we do not hope to achieve twice the result with half the effort. If we can achieve half the result with twice the effort, we will be very satisfied. The most we fear is toiling in vain. However, there are too many possibilities for toiling in vain. Because the passive obstruction is too great. For example, a plan that has just begun to take shape can be fundamentally shaken by news of a war thousands of miles away. Also, for example, a work that is planned very carefully can be completely stopped once it encounters a military necessity. There are many such things, and everyone understands them very well, so there is no need to go into detail. However, the colleagues of the Municipal Government will never shirk, evade, or abandon the responsibilities that we should bear because of these difficulties. Even if we cannot get things done, the greatest thing we can do is to do our best. I often think that to do a career, the first thing is to think of a way, the second thing is to have a way, and the third thing is to be able to do it. Not thinking of a way is not fulfilling one's responsibility. Not having a way means not having the ability. However, whether a way thought of by a capable and responsible person can be done depends not only on effort and ability, but also on the environment. No matter how great your ability is and no matter how hard you work, you cannot turn the tide under irresistible resistance. However, the general public will not think this way. They only know that you have not done things well, regardless of whether you have the ability, whether you have worked hard, or how great the resistance is and how bad the environment is. Therefore, we do not think about getting the general understanding of the citizens, and we do not have such a possibility. We only seek to use all our ability to be worthy of our conscience. Therefore, even if we are ashamed of public opinion, as long as we have no guilt in our hearts, we will be at ease. Today, in front of the members of the Advisory Committee, I frankly state our state of mind. I hope that the members will not only contribute their opinions as much as possible, but also actually assist in the implementation of various policies. Mayor Zhou reported on the seat of the Advisory Committee.

### Medical Service in the Hunan Battlefield

— Yoshiyu Aoki

The Tragedy of Xinshi

The epidemic prevention team of the Hankou Medical Association Clinic received orders to depart for front-line service. On a certain day of a certain month, I, along with my assistant and clerk Taro Yoshida, and nurses Misses Shiro Matsuda and Shengjie Zhao, departed from the ○○ station.

After reorganizing the ranks at the ○○ Reconstruction Department, our service team sat in a corner of a heavy-duty truck loaded with provisions, advancing towards the front lines, covered in dust. On the makeshift roads, muddy after days of heavy rain, hundreds of vehicles wound their way, adorned with colorful camouflage, swaying and silently advancing.

During our ten-day wait for orders in Xinshi, we voluntarily requested to serve at the battlefield hospital established by the Kuwata unit during its trial period. The pathological laboratory became the temporary office for my assistant and me, while the surgical operating room and the officers' ward became the temporary workplaces for the two nurses. This was also battlefield service. We opened our medical kits, took out our makeshift diagnostic tools, and began examining the endless stream of dysentery stool samples and blood samples from typhoid patients. It had been a long time since Yoshida and I had done this kind of work. I recalled the time I learned about culturing bacteria from Professor Endo; it was five or ten years ago. It was in the bacteriology classroom at Daegu Medical College, and in the research lab at Nagasaki Medical University. Yoshida had been studying medicine with me since he was fourteen, and we have been inseparable ever since.

A few days before July 6th, Yoshida could no longer serve due to vomiting, diarrhea, and malaria. On the morning of the 6th, he seemed to be pushing himself, so I said to him:

"Yoshida! Let's go! We have a lot of material today!"

Upon hearing my greeting, he jumped up as if he had regained his strength. As I was organizing the records and Yoshida was watching the artificially incubated bacteria, we suddenly heard someone shouting about an air raid. We immediately sought shelter, only to find six North American B-24 Liberator enemy planes flying overhead. Minutes later, another alarm sounded, and we jumped into the air raid shelter to see three enemy planes circling at low altitude. We all lay motionless at the very back of the shelter. The booming explosions, the sharp sounds of shrapnel piercing the air, and the sounds of collapsing buildings all intertwined. After a few minutes, we climbed out of the wretched smoke and called for Yoshida, but there was no answer. According to a medic's report, we rushed to the stone wall near where the bomb had landed and found Yoshida lying in a pool of blood, with huge shrapnel wounds on his chest and back. The wounds were wide open, like blooming pomegranates. Fortunately, the wounds were still clean, with no dirt seeping in, and since he was still breathing, we determined that his chest cavity had not been damaged. In addition, there were shrapnel wounds piercing his thighs. He was completely weakened due to excessive bleeding, but his breathing was still good. We immediately injected hemostatic drugs, applied temporary bandages, and then transported him to the surgical operating room.

The scene in the surgical operating room was extremely tragic. The enemy planes targeted the hospital, which was flying a Red Cross flag, dropping ○○ bombs. One of the bombs hit the ward, killing and wounding ○○ front-line soldiers. So, this batch of bomb-wounded soldiers was sent to the operating room one by one. Yoshida couldn't bear to watch the severely wounded patients beside him. Still regarding himself as a doctor, he worked tirelessly, continuing to inject cardiotonic and hemostatic drugs into the other wounded soldiers until the emergency kit was completely depleted.

After sending Yoshida to the ward, I rushed to the Reconstruction Department dormitory to make contact. The narrow road was covered with debris from collapsed houses, leaving almost no room to set foot. To make matters worse, a major fire broke out along the way, with flames blocking our path. A bomb had struck the road beside the dormitory, completely destroying half of the building, especially the front of the second floor, which was in a deplorable state. Two or three staff members were picking up scattered items, but there was no one else around. Nurse Matsuda was injured by falling debris, and nurse Shengjie Zhao was blown off the second floor by the blast wave as she was walking down, resulting in a stab wound to her buttocks and pain all over her body.

That night, we all went to the small mountain on the north shore to seek refuge. The hospital also decided to move. Under the bright light of the fifteenth day of the lunar month, a winding line of stretcher teams and wounded soldiers walking on their own surrounded the mountain and turned. In the end, we all gathered in the inner part of the original location.

That night's air raid was even more intense than the daytime one. Less than an hour after our camp had been set up and the wounded soldiers had just gathered, American planes began strafing and bombing. In an attempt to turn Xinshi into a scorched earth, three or five planes began wave after wave of bombing. Taking advantage of the moonlight, every fifteen or twenty minutes, the enemy planes would fly low when the explosions subsided, even machine-gunning a truck or dropping parachute bombs on a small house. This was America's attempt to kill humans and animals alike. The wounded soldiers were dispersed in time, taking advantage of the terrain. We were all worried that if the enemy planes spotted so many immobile wounded soldiers, they would immediately destroy them. Each time the enemy planes came, we felt that kind of concern, but fortunately it never became a reality.

We set up mosquito nets by the river near the wounded soldiers' assembly point, beside a Chinese tomb. We rested briefly, wearing shoes and leggings, but we had to flee to the alarm again in no time. Due to the repeated evacuations, the dozen or so staff members simply scattered and lay down in suitable shelters. However, the only ones who remained in the original location were me, Lieutenant Yao, and the driver Zhubing. The place where the three of us were lying was a depression surrounded by three mounds of earth. Although it was on the slope where enemy planes were invading, they flew by four or five times, and we gradually became uneasy. This panic was due to the fact that the enemy planes sometimes flew straight towards us, and the bombing was indiscriminate. At the same time, the enemy planes had machine guns on their tails. Just when we thought the plane had flown past and we were relieved, the machine guns on the tail would start firing. The three of us immediately ducked our heads down. The constant attacks by the enemy planes exhausted us. When the air raid was completely lifted, we congratulated each other on still being alive.

This was a tragic night across the river from Xinshi. Heaven was truly against us, providing the enemy planes with convenience by having a full moon in the sky. The abandoned city of Xinshi was left to be incinerated by incendiary bombs, and a strong wind started up, causing the fire dragon to rage everywhere. As we were watching, a corner of the temple wall suddenly collapsed, and sparks flew everywhere in the black smoke. The enemy planes were annoying and came to bomb again. This time, the bombing target was far away from us. We glared angrily at the enemy planes as they dropped bomb after bomb. In the distance, inverted isosceles triangular pillars of fire appeared and disappeared at equal intervals.

After a while, the air raid passed, and an odorous silence descended. Taking advantage of this opportunity, we moved again in search of a suitable location, followed by roll call and mutual greetings. Just as I was about to doze off in a blanket, I heard a woman's soft voice shout: "Mr. Matsuda!" It seemed to be the Chinese nurse, Miss Zhao, calling her companion. But there was no sound of Matsuda answering.

"Mr. Matsuda is not here, please come over here!" someone replied.

"Hello! Hello!"

"Where to?" As they talked, the Chinese nurse was led by the hand to the small mountain by a soldier who showed her kindness.

The depression where the three of us were lying had now become four. At this time, the air raid came again, flying to the front in the blink of an eye and dropping countless bombs, causing sand and rocks to fly and the sky to darken. After another two or three rounds of aircraft attacks, this Chinese woman said impatiently: "Sir, I don't want to be on the front lines, I want to go back to Hankou." I replied: "This is war! You and I are here to fight, this is what your former Chairman Wang said about living and dying together! Cheer up, despair is useless." Afterwards, we encountered dozens of bombings, and I always stayed close to Miss Zhao, fleeing together, or collapsing in a small cave, or the two of us squatting tightly in an air raid shelter. But later she remained silent until the beginning of November, when she finally completed her mission and left Changsha. Shengjie Zhao was educated by the Medical Association and then served in the Medical Association Hospital for five years. During this period, she was deeply influenced by the Japanese spirit, and this time she followed the army to fight the Chongqing army, wearing a military uniform and living the life of a Japanese soldier. Her thoughts and emotions were completely in line with ours Japanese people. After completing the medical treatment, she carried out pacification work among the Chinese people in the occupied areas, and did a great job for us Japanese. Because she had the feelings of the same nation, she could also serve as a translator for our Japanese soldiers who charged into battle, she was truly a treasure in our Japanese army. It can be said that she was the most effective Chinese person among the personnel in this battlefield service.

Tears of the Coolie

The once bustling streets are now deserted, with doors tightly closed, goods and furniture removed, leaving only the magnificent signs and decorations. This is the Westernized city of Changsha. Strolling on the road in a leisurely manner are only we Japanese, handling important official business. Every mile or half mile, there are well-arranged fire points. I thought they would be good shelters during air raids, but upon entering, I found many dead bodies, or sick and wounded lying down, and cluttered, dirty objects lined up. The trees on the road are still lush and shady, dividing the sidewalks on both sides. The traffic control platforms at the crossroads still stand tall.

When we arrived in Changsha on July 11th, the military facilities in the suburbs had been completely removed, and the traces of war in the city had been completely erased. Citizens gradually returned, and even the naked mannequins in the Western-style clothing stores were draped in beautiful clothes. The grocery stores displayed colorful glass water bottles, dazzlingly white shirts, a variety of ties, and socks. The pastry shops seemed to have displays of sugar-coated pastries and fried buns. At the vegetable market directly managed by the Reconstruction Department, we got up before dawn to buy fresh vegetables from the farmers who came in droves for the Japanese army. After finishing a bag of tobacco, these Chinese farmers bought rock salt back. Some bought some medicine from us to treat wounds, and some asked us to bandage their wounds. Some also bought quinine pills for their parents and wives. There are a lot of sparrows in Changsha in the morning. In fact, they are not all sparrows, but there are many birds with beautiful voices, and when dawn is about to come, they always happily call out a word or two outside the window.

The day after we arrived in Changsha, the sick and wounded began to come for treatment, so we temporarily used the office as a temporary clinic. The first patient was a Chinese coolie who had been injured by a landmine, so we immediately felt the smell of gunpowder on the battlefield. The others were ordinary menstrual pains. Due to the incomprehensible Chinese language and the gestures, laughter often broke out between us, and sometimes we mistook women for men. This was a morning scene at our clinic in Changsha at that time.

What destroyed this painting was the enemy air raid on the evening of July 16th. After the bombing subsided that night, I stood on the stone steps in front of the Reconstruction Department and looked into the distance, watching the dark, smoky fire. Sometimes flames like fire dragons occurred, mixed with sounds like firecrackers for the New Year. Gradually it got dark, but in the shadows, four or five people appeared, some hobbling with crutches, some with their arms in slings, carrying patients in on a door. So, I called out the two nurses to carry out the treatment. The third patient was a woman around forty years old, with a bullet wound through her shoulder, which also had a considerable impact on her lungs. When she was carried in front of us, she suddenly vomited and had diarrhea, and the fifteen or sixteen-year-old girl who was serving her began to cry loudly. After two injections, fortunately the vomiting of blood stopped, and her breathing gradually improved, so she was temporarily placed in a folk house in front of the door to lie down. Then I looked at the next patient, and accidentally glanced out the door, and the patient lying on that door panel had changed color. So I ordered the nurse to carry out emergency treatment, but when I went to get the injection kit, she was already dead. Although I gave her injections of cardiotonic, they had no effect. At that time, my Chinese language was unable to express my meaning, so I had to take out a piece of paper from my pocket and cover the face of the deceased. The girl immediately burst into tears. In this environment, I had to leave silently and go to see other patients.

The enemy's blind bombing also "visited" many times later. During the day, P-41 enemy planes came to侦察, which has almost become a daily routine. The largest-scale bombing was on July ○, that day almost entirely incendiary bombs, mainly to completely burn down the deserted houses by the river. Although the wounded were surprisingly few, although we were waiting to implement emergency treatment, but this time we saw that it was not bombing injuries at all, but fire injuries, so this time not only were more bandages used, but also more ointments were used. The bandages were war trophies snatched by the ○○ team. Among them were bandages from the Hong Kong Salvation Team and the Dagang Bao征募 or donations, which were later abandoned by the so-called salvation fighters, but now they fell into our hands, but they are saving the same Chinese people.

One moonlit night in mid-August, I was sleeping in a rattan chair in the bedroom when I was awakened by a creepy bomb explosion. It was probably because the lights were leaking out, and a dive bombing was carried out, but later nothing happened.

The next morning, I got up at the usual time and went to the well with a washbasin to fetch water. In front of the door shrouded in the morning mist stood a strange patient. This seems to be a ten-year-old child with an injured wrist. Upon closer inspection, there was a large wound from his left shoulder to his elbow, and he was hanging an arm full of blood with a rope.

"Airplane came, bang?" When I asked this, he seemed to understand what I meant. I asked again:

"Father mother no?"

He said emotionlessly, "Mother yes". What exactly does his mother do? I was thinking this in my heart, and led this blood-covered wounded person to the clinic.

Many wounded people gradually gathered in front of the door, including a coolie in his fifties who had been burned with the child. This coolie was so difficult to even stand because of excessive bleeding. Treatment was carried out on the road. After washing the wound infiltrated with sand and soil, I saw that the tendons and muscles were broken, but the bones were not broken. He was really dirty to the point of no return. His hair was disheveled, his face was covered with dirt, and even his ears and nostrils were filled with dust. His clothes were indistinguishable from the mud. It is said that this person lived very close to the child.

The next day, they came to my house together like father and son. These two people only said they came to see a doctor for one day, but they came to see me for ten days. One night, enemy planes came to bomb again, so that the entire Reconstruction Department was burned down, but fortunately there were few injured. But the next morning, these two father and son people were finally gone. About a week later, only that coolie came to the clinic. He was still that dirty appearance, but there was more pus and blood seeping out of that bandage. I asked about the child, only to find out that he was taken to the countryside by an adult. I felt a slight sense of longing, so I had to treat this coolie alone, but it was not easy to get better.

One day, we received an order from the military authorities to go to the countryside of Xiangyin and Changsha counties to carry out medical and pacification work, but there were already many patients, and there was really no way to stop the clinic. So, we put up a bulletin saying that we were going elsewhere. The next day, I made the last treatment, and gave each patient medicines for a considerable period of time, telling them to be careful to change the medicine, but most of them said Hua "no way", among them that coolie, after receiving the medicine and bandages, broke down in tears when he parted ways with me. My heart also felt a sour.

Red Cross Flag Advance

Military police, fully armed with grenades and pistols, and wearing Japanese shoes and civilian clothes, followed the guides and translators, all the way forward. Next was Nurse Matsuda, like a child soldier, and the Chinese nurse, Miss Zhao, wearing Chinese clothes on the upper body and Japanese soldier clothes on the lower body. Behind them were the technical assistant Yoshida, carrying a white material box, and Sergeant Tanoue, holding a large Red Cross flag, duty soldiers, security team members, and two coolies carrying luggage. At the end was me, carrying a small medical kit and an emergency kit. This was the ordinary formation of our medical pacification team going to the battlefield service. The soldiers of the security team protected us, they always covered the flag and silenced the drums, camouflaging all equipment.

Three days after leaving the Changsha Reconstruction Department on the morning of August 24, we toured several places in the suburbs of Changsha with the Chinese film street performance team, and stayed in several places. On September 3, we returned to the annoying Xinshi. After staying in Xinshi for nine days, thanks to the hard work of the local security team, the citizens finally slowly returned, so we took this group of returning citizens as our work object, using medical treatment and movies as a tool to pacify them. Later, personnel from the railway construction unit came to repair all the places where the Yuehan Road was damaged.

We followed the Kataoka team and moved from a certain place near Xinshi to the Dachu River in a village near the Yuehan Road Bridge. Our column crossed through the ripe rice fields, wading through mountains and rivers, and moving forward. Today's class flag was held at the front by the military police translation. The slopes of the automobile highway were reflected in the distant glow, and the river flowed murmuringly in the red earthen embankment. The refreshing breeze of early autumn was indeed the best day for marching. Before departure, I had paid special attention to the enemy bandits and landmines under the mountain on the right, but the beauty of the great rivers and mountains made me have to look around. There were traces of farming in the scattered houses and fields, but there were no residents. Why are there no Chinese residents in the places we go to? This is a common phenomenon in places that have not been pacified, which is not surprising. At the same time, due to their clever observation and communication, as soon as they saw the traces of us Japanese, they all disappeared. Sometimes, you can only see an old woman coming to care for the family, and children who are curious and steal a peek through the window, other than that, you can't see any Chinese people.

Finally, we arrived at the village we wanted to go to. Because it was surrounded by trees, you can only see the forest from a distance and not the village. But unexpectedly, there are many people, and in front of the club hall, there are tables and chairs arranged, with forty or fifty people drinking tea and wiping their hot towels, it seems to welcome distinguished guests. When they saw me wearing a Red Cross armband, everyone was surprised. In unison they said, Military medical officer! Military medical officer! Because I asked them to see me as an ordinary doctor, I took off my iron helmet to reveal my messy hair. They invited us to drink, finally we got along well, and then we started to treat their illnesses.

Because it was already arranged for Miss Zhao to be a translator and help, and Matsuda to do the coating and washing work, there were especially many seriously ill people, and only seventy people could be treated within the scheduled two hours. There were especially many people with 痧 eye, and our makeshift street clinics like this could not save these people's eye diseases. Later, we found that there were especially many children, which made us even more sad.

The residents of the area seemed to have never seen a doctor at all. When they saw the stethoscope, they were all uneasy, and had to touch it with their hands to see what it was. The carbuncles that grew on the heads and buttocks of children were put into an extra-large syringe to drain the pus, so the Chinese masses all thought we were miracle doctors. When we saw the surprised and happy expressions on the faces of the mothers of the sick children, we felt a little comfort in our hearts.

The morning in the village was brightened by the crowing of roosters and the Japanese army's reciting of the Imperial Edict. I was surrounded by a group of children who had been treated yesterday while washing my face by the river. They all seemed to be saying that this doctor is really great. The farmers who had already started working seemed to be asking "Are you full, sir?" when they said good morning. A Japanese plane was flying in the sky, reflecting the sun symbol. This is truly a peaceful village scene where people live and work in peace.

The Situation Map of the Greater East Asia War Zone

There are four focal points of the Greater East Asia War, namely (1) the Southwestern Pacific front, (2) the Philippine front, (3) the Southwestern mainland front, and (4) the India-Burma front. Looking at these focal points as a whole, the regions have inherent differences, and the war situations are also different, but their consistent feature is that these four fronts are all battlefields where Japan and the United States are fighting to the death with all their strength. The enemy American's general counter-offensive of materiel began with the Guadalcanal operation in July 1942. Since then, the battlefield has moved north to the Solomon Islands, and then divided into two. One passed through the Gilbert, Marshall, and Mariana Islands, and in mid-September 1944, moved towards the western Caroline waters of Peleliu and Angaur. The other advanced west along the northern coast of New Guinea, passing through Biak and Noemfoor, and in mid-September of the same year, it also moved to the Moluccas centered on Morotai. By October of the same year, the leading edge of the enemy American pincer attack met and began a true invasion. Therefore, naval and air battles off the coast of Taiwan and the eastern coast of the Philippines were launched one after another. Although its strength suffered great losses, it still relied on its material resources to land on Leyte Island in the central Philippines, and then landed on Mindoro Island. As a result, the Japanese and American armies staged an unprecedented bloody battle. They then moved north and landed along the coast of Lingayen Gulf on Luzon Island, driving south towards Manila. The Japanese army in that area had long been confident and waited in ease, adopting an elastic strategy, not caring about the gains and losses of the city, and focusing on attacking the American army under MacArthur, causing them to bleed heavily. Therefore, the fall of Manila or not has little impact on the future of the Philippine battlefield, and even if MacArthur wins the city, he will not be able to immediately determine his victory in the Philippines. Tens of thousands of Japanese troops under the command of General Yamashita are still safe and sound, and the important areas on Luzon Island are also in the hands of the Japanese army. In short, the Philippine war will inevitably become more intense in the future. (The picture and text are based on Asahi Pictorial No. 155)

### After Graduation

— Liu Jiagan

The clouds of October are like sheep, the winds of October are like the ebb and flow of the sea, and the sunlight of October is like the candle flame in a temple.

The oleander tree in front of the courtyard has shed its last petal, its branches and leaves sparse, appearing much thinner; the small loquat tree nestled in the corner, its slender trunk barely a handful, is covered in a layer of dark dust even on its palm-sized leaves, and not a single green sprout can be found.

Only the begonia is blooming bright red, its blossoms floating with a charming smile.

The earth begins to enter its aging years.

School has also begun. Students are once again streaming in and out of the buildings; professors, clutching thick leather briefcases, step onto the podiums, writing down the teaching materials they have repeated for years; the corridors are filled with the clamor of voices; the chemical laboratory overflows with the odor of carbon disulfide; the motors in the electrical engineering lab grind; several theodolites are set up on campus, and the red cloth on the Flag Pole flutters in the wind, as civil engineering students practice surveying.... Everything, everything is no different from the scenes of the past three years. After a two-month break, I am now reliving the old dream of school. Faced with these familiar sounds and shadows, I can't help but ask, "How have you been?"

But I have finally found some differences. I no longer see that familiar group of faces. They have graduated and left this school forever, replaced by a large group of unfamiliar new students. In the past, my heart would have been filled with joy, because in our life's journey, we had unconsciously gained another group of brothers and sisters, moving together towards the same goal, even though I didn't know them.

However, this year there is something different. Swirls have risen in the lake of my heart, and I feel unable to calm down.

A friend asked me, "Are you a Senior this year?"

"Mmm," I replied.

"Great, you'll graduate next year. It's so fast, so fast, haha!" He laughed, patting my arm.

I looked at him, speechless, only smiling at this friend.

I received a letter from afar, which read:

"Congratulations on wearing the square hat next year."

After reading it, I also smiled at the letter.

At noon, I met Miss W in a Cantonese restaurant often frequented by university students. In the course of our conversation, the issue of my graduating next year came up again. Then Miss W thought of a question:

"What are you planning to do after you graduate next year?"

This question was like a sledgehammer, hitting my chest, causing a moment of compression. Really, "What am I planning to do after graduation?"—I asked myself.

To Miss W's question, I could only respond with a "smile."

Besides answering with a "smile," what else could I say?

I didn't expect that as soon as I reached the fourth year, people would start asking me these questions. I never imagined that I would be as silent as a cicada in winter, unable to say a single answer, even though there was still a long year before graduation. But I have gradually begun to feel troubled.

Mr. C, who studied engineering, graduated almost a year ago, but for the past year he has not been drafting in a design studio, nor supervising construction at a construction site. Instead, he is working as an accountant in a bank; another Mr. H, who studied architectural engineering, became a Japanese translator after graduation, thanks to his talent for languages, even though there was no Japanese course in his school. Mr. W, Mr. T, and Mr. L jointly invested in a stock company after graduation, embarking on their great commercial ambitions. They must regret not studying commerce in school and choosing civil engineering instead. Mr. S, Mr. M, and Mr. F have all become teachers in primary and secondary schools. According to them, although it is "using great talent for small tasks," in this day and age, everything is inevitably "making a big deal out of small things," and they are content with their lot. Mr. Wang is still temporarily working as a ticket seller at a handball court after graduation. Recently, he has been worried about not finding a formal job. If he still can't find a suitable job in another six months, the knowledge of electrical engineering he gained in those four years will inevitably be thrown to the winds! Another friend told me that, as of now, only one-fifth of his graduating class this year has found formal employment, and only five or six of them have found jobs in their so-called "field."

"Graduation means unemployment" and "What you learn is not what you use" are two phrases that I often hear from friends who have graduated. I didn't expect that these two "old tunes" still have their power today, but what is the ultimate force that drives this power?

—Is it the flaws of society? Or the failure of education?

On the tram, I met Miss Y and another Mr. F, whom I hadn't seen for more than a year. Miss Y, being unreserved, told me that she was going to marry Mr. F in another six months. I suddenly asked her:

"Aren't you going to graduate in another six months?"

"! That's right."

"That's really great, graduation—marriage, it's really a double happiness!" I congratulated her sincerely, and Miss Y blushed and smiled.

After getting off the tram and just stepping into the school gate, I suddenly slapped my thigh and thought of a truth:

"A great way out after graduation—marriage!" But after thinking about it again, I felt my interest greatly diminished, because:

It's a pity that "taking a son-in-law" is no longer in vogue!

George Bernard Shaw's way of dealing with life was that he thought a person should first jump to the end of life, and then leisurely turn back to carefully savor life. But now I know it too late. If I could have tasted the troubles I have now earlier, and then go back to savor the joy of my freshman year, it would definitely be better.

"What are you planning to do after graduation?" The question is still ringing in my ears.

My mind is as gloomy as the weather outside.

### Chapter of Silence

— Tian Ni

I love silence, and, I remember, this quirk doesn't belong to me. We would often sit facing each other without a word. But loneliness also has its limits. Even though we love silence, sometimes a sound will break this moment of tranquility. And, the one who always lets a rough, abrupt sound intrude into the calm and peaceful air is you.

You just have such a strange temperament. When I rest my hand on my cheek in deep thought, you will look at me with an envious gaze. You may envy me for having such happiness, because I actually have the ability to abandon troubles; so you follow suit, resting your little hand on your cheek. In this way, we both fall into a lovely silence. However, before long, this silence ceases to be lovely to you. After all, you have the restlessness of a child. No matter how gentle you are, you throw a tantrum. After that strange silence, you will use your own voice to break the quiet world that you have created.

"It's too lonely," you shout like that.

I know you won't linger in silence for long. This cry is just as I expected. But I didn't pay attention to you. If I have a sense of pride in my ability to be silent, I was just thinking about how to train you. Ignoring you is a sign of my silence. Moreover, I am reluctant to leave my moment of quiet. I am immersed in memories, and the vanished kingdom is the world in my reverie. You are no longer in my thoughts, even if you are, it is unrealistic. A person should be happy if they have a moment of fantastic experience.

"What, are you dozing off?" How piercing this sound is in the silence. I was awakened by it, and opened my eyes, feeling lost and disoriented. I looked up at the surrounding furnishings, and there was you beside me; I seemed to have had a dreamy dream.

Your face still shows a question mark. Therefore, I gave you a bitter smile. You don't understand, I thought to myself. At this point, I couldn't maintain my ability to be silent, so I answered you:

"No, I closed my eyes, trying to find the traces of my thoughts."

These words, to you, must have another mysterious meaning. You opened your eyes wide, clearly unconvinced, and then you looked at me again with an envious expression, wanting to understand the deeper meaning of my words.

I seek the traces of thoughts, and you seek me in a daze.

So, I lowered my head again to rest my chin, signaling to you that I needed to go to the daze to find the threads of thought. If we are occupied by silence, we should be happy, at least I am.

I no longer bothered with your concern, and stepped into the kingdom of fantasy. I finally entered the place that I had longed for for so long and was being thought of. I seemed to see the ten thousand rays of light from that strange land, shooting into my eyes and dazzling me. Even though the traces of thoughts were chaotic, my illusions had a target. I vaguely heard your voice beside me, it was a factor of remembrance, even if I entered a hazy illusion, I remembered that there was you.

So I never got lost in the daze. In this strange land, I was panicked and at a loss, but there was you, there was your voice, and I calmed myself down. In this way, I discovered the value of sound. Sometimes, we are in such a lonely world! I want to commend you.

### A Street Scene

— Shi Gang

Who dropped a banknote?

It's somersaulting along the road in the wind.

A pedestrian walks by,

Glances at it;

A second one walks by,

Doesn't even look;

The third one is a beggar,

Kicks it with his broken shoe,

And walks away!

(Ah! What a world of gentlemen!)

The banknote flips freely, flips

Flips to the feet of a street cleaner;

But it is swept away by his broom,

As casually as sweeping fallen leaves.

Leaving only the street cleaner's seemingly resentful, a murmur—one dollar!

### Further Commentary on the Sino-Northern China Joint Friendship Match: My Views on the Refereeing of the China-Shantou Game

— Bixian

The last match of the first round of the third basketball league, Group A, between Zhongbei and Hualian, was no less than a North-South battle, and could also be a resolution to the unresolved championship issue of the Shanghai News Cup. It was truly one of the most attractive games. Therefore, the game time was set at 8:00 PM, but fans had already arrived in droves before 6:00 PM, so that the basketball court was packed beyond capacity, exceeding the estimated number by several times. The boundary line circle took up a lot of space, which hindered the formal competition. However, under the circumstances at the time, stopping the game would easily cause trouble. Therefore, the authorities and both sides agreed to change it to a friendly match, so that the fans who had traveled a long way would not have made the trip in vain. However, the performance in the small basketball court could not be fully developed. It may be helpful to briefly review it, but how long this league will be delayed and how the authorities plan to maintain it properly is of great concern to fans.

Zhao Yalin's Outstanding Performance

As a result of this game, Zhongbei still maintained its victory. The main reason why Zhongbei was able to win was that each player had a lot of strength, which allowed them to develop. The team's formation was arranged in an unpredictable manner, which was the result of careful study by Team Leader Wang and Director Dai to control the opposing team. The reuse of Zhao Yalin in this battle was definitely a necessary adjustment. On the one hand, it utilized Zhao's height and on the other hand, Zhao's recent condition was extremely good. His shooting skills have also recovered to the vigor of his heyday in Beiping. His one-handed backhand shot had a unique touch, and his hard-working and aggressive spirit would be criticized by those outside, but in fact, Yalin was a pure Northern-style "decisive son." Moreover, Yalin always apologized after accidentally bumping into people, and his temper was excellent. Chen Xuezong also had satisfactory results. Zhen Zhong was always flawless in every game, worthy of being a national player. Bao Songtu, who made his debut in Zhongbei for the first time in this session, was not as dominant as he was in the Huaying team, because the expectations of other players were higher than Bao's. As a result, the Zhongbei team's man-to-man defense, the position of their players, and the mutual switching of guards were all very skilled. Under the planning of Wang and Dai, and based on the current situation, if they continue to develop normally, their technical contributions will definitely allow fans to enjoy more!

Zhang Xiyan Attempts New Formations

In this battle, Hualian's team leader Zhang Xiyan put in a lot of effort to try out new formations to face the powerful enemy. Failure is another matter. But the line of trial, is not thought of by the average person, and has a significant success. For example, Jiusheng's front line and Qinggong's defense were the most recent to be seen. Hualian certainly did not make its best efforts in this battle. Moreover, with Wu Chengzhang's casualness and Xuezong's outstanding performance, this was also an auxiliary experience. Since this battle was a friendly match, Hualian regarded it as a touchstone, and it was okay to lose and practice. In the future official league, perhaps they can learn from this battle and figure out how to respond.

In summary, in the battle between Zhongbei and Hualian, the game was changed from a league match to a friendly match, and the gains and losses were of no great importance. We will see you again in the future, show us up and down, Zhongbei must also be careful to prevent.

The Refereeing of the Hualian vs. Shantou Game Was Full of Errors

The second round of the Hualian and Shantou game on Tuesday of this week was still very popular among fans. Therefore, even though it was during the New Year holiday, the lively scene was as expected.

This time, both sides used a tight pressing man-to-man system, and every time the other side got the ball, they would chase and force them to let go. And they would never easily give the other side a chance to go up to the basket. Therefore, the scores were very low. The first half was nine to four, and the overall result was twenty to eleven, with Hualian taking the lead in both. Such a close score is the most standard score in basketball games. Unfortunately, the audience was dissatisfied with the referee's many mistakes, and there was a lot of noise, which led to slight misconduct among the players, but fortunately it was quickly quelled. According to the referee Yang Liecheng and Jin Botao. In terms of the abilities of the two, Jin is actually better than Yang. However, Mr. Yang has always had a temper of being good at his job. In such a tense game, he did not know how to retreat slightly, so once there was a mistake, it caused the audience to scream, and the more chaotic it became, the more chaotic it became. Mr. Yang should know the reason for this, and Jin Botao, who was in an auxiliary position, was mostly sitting and watching, reversing his usual ability, and should also be held responsible for not fulfilling his duties. The author, I must be at every game, I always sympathize with the referee's difficulties, and I have also written "Basketball Refereeing is Difficult" twice in this magazine, but this time, because the facts are clear, I have to add my personal opinions, and I hope that the referee association will correct it.

Tonight's Central Shantou Game Will Definitely See Each Side Fighting With New Methods

The second round of Group A will see Zhongbei and Shantou meet again. According to the Shanghai News Cup, the Shantou team had defeated Zhongbei. In the first round of the third league, Zhongbei took revenge. Tonight's (18th) meeting is the third battle. It can also be called the final battle of the two teams' best-of-three series. It is expected that both sides will fight with wits and strength, a big melee. At present, both teams have adopted a man-to-man guard, so we will see a one-on-one desperate shot. Zhongbei's ability to have the best lineup in the face of the battle is the most admirable, and Shantou should plan for the round lineup. The most important thing is not to deal with it with a fixed lineup, but to control it according to the number of people on the other side, so that there will be an unexpected performance. Considering the recent situation, Zhongbei has maintained its undefeated record in the league, while Shantou has suffered two defeats to Hualian, and its morale is not as good as Zhongbei. Therefore, in theory, Zhongbei should be able to win. In short, this battle is also a wonderful curtain.

### Miscellaneous Thoughts on the Sino-Portuguese Cup Second Game

— Mei Jie

After the restoration of the Sino-Portuguese Cup this year, it has attracted much attention from all walks of life, because both teams' skills are famous players in Shanghai. There will definitely be a peak performance to satisfy the fans. The competition is still a best-of-three series. The first battle was held at Yiyuan on January 1st. The Portuguese team sent out all its elite, while the Chinese team was not in order. As a result, they lost to Portugal by a score of two to four.

The Lineups of Both Teams are Declining, and the Performance Cannot Be Wonderful

The second battle was held at the racecourse stadium on the afternoon of the second day of the Lunar New Year (February 13th) on Tuesday of this week. In advance, we must have thought that the Portuguese team would continue to work hard to complete its hegemony, and the Chinese team would also use its most ideal lineup to win victory and have superb skills. Unexpectedly, among the members of our Chinese team, the players selected by the Donghua team were unable to participate in the competition due to various reasons, and everyone felt worried for the Chinese team. Unexpectedly, when the Portuguese team faced the battle, six generals, including Pan Limi, Victor, Kao Sitan, Bao Xiu Tuo, W. Pan Tuo Xun, and Fu En, were absent. A few people were drawn from the reserve army and the B team to form a team. Therefore, although the Chinese team was not ideal, it still defeated Portugal with a huge score of five to zero, winning the victory and not disappointing the public. However, due to the declining lineups of both sides, there was naturally very little excitement.

Based on the lineup and strength of this day, it is not too much for the Chinese team to win five goals. After all, the Portuguese team is a motley crew. On the front line, except for V. Su Ruo, the center guard line only has one Oliveira, and the back guard only has one Ke Lai Tuo. How can they rely on this triangle line to score goals and attack? A mess of sand. The Chinese team is based on the Friendship team, supplemented by Hua Tong Meng Yiliang, Shanghai Police Yu's brothers, etc. In terms of cooperation, there is very little impact. They won five cities in a row, and there was absolutely no fluke.

The Portuguese Team's Sloppy Response is Unfathomable

However, after watching this game, the author has some feelings. The situation of the past Sino-Portuguese Cup was always like a raging fire, and the two teams attached great importance to the cup competition, selected team members, stepped up training, and spent a lot of effort. In the end, they had good results. Therefore, regardless of the winner or loser, their serious engagement attracted fans and created a record worth recording in the history of the game. The fact that this second battle created such a scattered phenomenon is really incomprehensible. Moreover, Portugal's response to this historic battle, at this critical moment, with seven or zero people falling behind, is it intentionally giving way? Or does it have other effects? Or is it waiting until the final game to show its power again? This is difficult to know unless the team authorities know the mystery of the matter. In short, it is a fact that it is completely different from the past serious approach, which was necessary to win the silver cup. Finally, the author can only hope that in the third battle, both sides can have the determination to win, and send all their forces to ensure that this year's Sino-Portuguese Cup has the most hopeful harvest, and it will not live up to the efforts of the Football Association to restore this cup competition.

### Today's Football League: Friendship vs. Police Fierce Battle

Today (18th) in the morning, there will be a wonderful scene in the Group A league at Yiguan, which is the friendship battle against the Shanghai Police. The former has only one draw in the league, and the rest have been victories. It occupies the first place in the police force and has a strong hope of winning the championship. Since the Friendship team set out this season, its momentum has been very strong, and its record is also remarkable. However, it drew with De Shang in the league, and also suffered from De Shang's poisonous hands in the Mayor's Cup. Is De Shang the nemesis of the team? Fortunately, the Friendship team still has hope in the league. Since there is no path to Jin in the Mayor's Cup, it should devote all its efforts to this. It should be determined to face the enemy this morning. The people of the Shanghai Police Force are indeed very impressive. However, this year, they have not been able to get their loyalty, until the recent Mayor's Cup, when they defeated the Portuguese merchants, who were clamoring at the time, by two to one, and displayed the skills that they should have. And the most terrible thing about them is their sharp offensive. One of the small yellow hairs窜，麥其當之脚頭，Friendship should seek victory, must find a way to stop these two people, and the most important point of their own, must use the most popular center guard line. Song Xisheng, Qu Yongfu, and Zheng Yingquan must all attend. Only in this way can they respond to each other, so with the ability of the five forwards, once they get the help of the center guard line, they will definitely be able to break the enemy. Moreover, they must avoid being too emotional and should be calm. They must know that the more angry they are, the easier it is to lose their composure. They should always maintain the spirit of the upper court, then their harvest, no matter what, will definitely give a good impression to the fans. I hope all the athletes will keep this in mind.

### Essentials of Basketball Theory (10) (1)

— Liang Zhaoan

(3) In a certain strategy, it serves as a means of deploying the formation and adapting to the situation.

(4) To maintain the opportunity to get the ball and prevent the opponent from taking it away.

(5) Used to escape the opponent's snatching.

(6) Used to deceive the opponent. Shift the situation and disperse the opponent.

(7) When there is no one defending, to dribble the ball closer to the basket for easy shooting.

(3) Three Keys to Dribbling

(1) The pace should be changed frequently. Do not use one kind of pace and a certain speed to advance. Use various fast and slow paces that are uncertain, so that people cannot grasp the dribbling and pace to adapt to the situation and environment. (2) Dribble the ball with one hand that is farther away from the enemy: For example, when the enemy is tracking and stealing the ball on the right side, then the left hand should be used to dribble the ball. If the enemy is stealing the ball on the left side, then the right hand should be used. (3) Make a sharp turn. For example, if you encounter an enemy in front, first pretend to go to the left to dribble the ball, so that the enemy's body tends to the left and loses its center of gravity, then quickly turn to the right to dribble and rush past him.

(4) Common Sense of Dribbling

(1) In the front court (i.e. your own basket area), do not always dribble the ball forward (unless the front court is empty).

(2) Do not look down when dribbling and do not pay attention to the front court.

(3) Do not develop a habit of督　, when you can pass the ball, but use the dribble to keep it in mind, passing the ball is faster than dribbling.

(4) Do not stand and switch the ball with both hands, or act like a neurotic, doing unconscious ball play, which hinders the offensive opportunity. Many times, you become a jumper because of this.

(5) The height and speed of the dribble should be matched with the overall structure of your body. Strive to achieve the greatest possible continuousness, while still being able to keep the ball under full control.

(6) The most proper way to dribble past the enemy is to dribble straight towards the enemy, and when you are two or three yards away from the enemy, quickly turn to the left or right to dribble past him.

### Letter from Jia Youliang: A Statement for Tung Wah and Himself

Mr. Jia Youliang's letter states that the restoration of the Sino-Portuguese Cup has allowed this historical competition to continue, which is a great thing for the football world. In this year's first match, our Chinese team was unfortunately defeated. For the second match, all the players of our Tung Wah team were unable to participate due to work commitments, which attracted much attention from all walks of life before the match. In fact, most of our colleagues are engaged in the silver and money industry, and their working hours on the 12th are very late. The match was on the 13th. If they were forced to play, they would not have good results. Therefore, it would be better to retire. This is the only reason for the Tung Wah team's withdrawal from the Chinese team. Fortunately, the second match has already been held, and the Portuguese team has been overcome through careful selection and adjustment by the authorities. It can be said that our team's withdrawal has at least yielded this gain.

Furthermore, I have been "temporarily suspended from representing the Chinese team" by the Football Association due to the conflict with Victor. As for the penalty imposed by the authorities, athletes are always happy to accept it. However, I have not yet seen the so-called temporary suspension announcement from the Football Association, which may cause some misunderstandings from the outside world. Therefore, I make the above statement.
