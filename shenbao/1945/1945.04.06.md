### The Japanese Prime Minister's Residence Held an Emergency Meeting Yesterday; The Koiso Cabinet Resigned En Masse; Senior Ministers Convened in the Palace to Deliberate on Successor Candidates

Tokyo, 5th (Central News Agency Telegram) – The Japanese Information Bureau announced at 7:00 PM on the 5th: Considering the gravity of the current situation, and in the hope that a stronger cabinet will emerge, the current cabinet has resigned en masse. Prime Minister Koiso has collected the resignations of all cabinet members and respectfully submitted them to the Emperor.

Tokyo, 5th (Central News Agency) – Telegram: Since its formation on July 22nd of last year, the Koiso Cabinet has strived to manage the profound war situation and bear the heavy responsibility of governing the nation. Now, as the war situation changes rapidly and urgently, an even stronger cabinet is needed to advance towards the completion of the war. Therefore, it was decided that the cabinet would resign en masse. At 9:00 AM on the 5th, an emergency temporary meeting was convened at the Prime Minister's official residence. The Prime Minister first revealed his determination and sought the understanding of the cabinet ministers for the resignation. Consequently, the resignation was drafted during the cabinet meeting, and at 10:13 AM, it was respectfully submitted to the Palace. The Koiso Cabinet, from its formation, lasted eight and a half months and now it has decided to resign en masse.

Tokyo, 5th (Central News Agency Telegram) – After the Koiso Cabinet decided to resign en masse on the 5th, His Majesty the Emperor summoned Kido Koichi, the Lord Keeper of the Privy Seal, to inquire about candidates for the next prime minister. Kido Koichi, having received the imperial command, and considering the great importance of the situation, requested the senior ministers to attend a meeting in the Palace to gather opinions before responding to the imperial inquiry. Those in attendance included General Keisuke Okada, President of the Privy Council Suzuki, Hirota Koki, General Hideki Tojo, Baron Kiichiro Hiranuma, Duke Fumimaro Konoe, Baron Reijiro Wakatsuki and other senior ministers. From 3:00 PM to 6:00 PM, they successively entered the Palace and carefully discussed and expressed their opinions on the matter of selecting the next prime minister.

Reasons for the En Masse Resignation of the Koiso Cabinet

Tokyo, 5th (Central News Agency Telegram) – Since its formation last summer in July, the Koiso Cabinet established the Supreme War Guidance Council in order to ensure the unity of political and military affairs, and in response to the needs of wartime, it exerted all its efforts to increase the production of aircraft and military supplies. It also mobilized all its resources and was determined to implement decisive battle measures. However, from the end of last year to the beginning of this year, due to the progress of the Philippine campaign, the loss of Iwo Jima, and the intensification of air raids, the war situation became increasingly serious. In order to reverse the tide, on March 16th, the cabinet, in accordance with the imperial will, decided that the Prime Minister could attend the Imperial General Headquarters meetings and further established the Supreme War Guidance Council to unify command and state affairs, so as to actively promote all policies. However, the severity of the war situation did not diminish, and it ultimately entered the critical stage of a decisive battle on the homeland. Therefore, to overcome this major crisis and establish an integrated relationship between command and state affairs was an urgent task. Thus, the cabinet keenly felt the need for fundamental improvement, but despite repeated efforts, it was unable to achieve the desired results. Therefore, it decided to look forward to the next cabinet and resolutely implemented the en masse resignation.

### Japanese Garrison Forces Launch a Counterattack South of Chatan in Okinawa, Inflicting Heavy Damage on the Enemy with Hand-to-Hand Combat Tactics

Tokyo, 5th (Central News Agency Telegram) – Enemy forces advancing southward on the west coast of Okinawa Island in the Chatan area had reached Oyama, three kilometers south of Chatan, by noon on the 4th. Under the cover of five tanks, the enemy attempted to attack the high ground southeast of Oyama. At that time, the Japanese garrison forces immediately engaged them, resulting in the destruction of four enemy tanks and the repulse of the enemy. Another enemy force, eager to use both the northern and central airfields, seems to have started using them even though some parts have not been completely repaired.

Tokyo, 5th (Central News Agency Telegram) – On Okinawa Island, American forces advanced towards Awase at noon on the 3rd, cutting the island in two from north to south. Currently, American forces are advancing south along the coast of Awase. At around 3:00 PM on the afternoon of the 3rd, an enemy force of about 400 men with 30 M4 tanks reached Kuba (about 5 kilometers south of Awase). In coordination with this, enemy forces in the Chatan area attacked Futenma with a unit of 10 M4 tanks on the evening of the 3rd, while another small unit of 23 tanks advanced to Kiyuna. Japanese garrison units are engaging the enemy at various locations. On the night of the 3rd, they launched a courageous hand-to-hand combat operation, inflicting heavy damage on the enemy. On the morning of the 4th, four enemy battalions with about 50 tanks and numerous mortars, under the cover of artillery fire, attacked the areas north of Yae and Ginowan. Japanese units in the area immediately engaged them, and fierce fighting is underway. On the morning of the 4th, the enemy's line of attack stretched from Isa, Kiyuna, Futenma, and Aganiya to Kuba, with little change from the battle situation of the evening of the 3rd. Japanese air units continued their fierce attacks on enemy ships around Okinawa Island. The results of their operations from the morning of the 3rd to dawn on the 4th are as follows: Between 5:50 AM and 6:00 AM on the morning of the 3rd, two large columns of fire were seen in the sea off the coast of the island. At around 1:20 AM, two more large columns of fire were seen in the sea south of Minatogawa. At 2:00 AM on the morning of the 4th, an enemy transport ship was burned south of Minatogawa. At 5:10 AM, a large column of fire also occurred to the west of the island.

Tokyo, 4th (Central News Agency Telegram) – Japanese ground forces are inflicting heavy damage on the enemy forces that landed on Okinawa Island. Fierce counterattacks continue in various parts of the island, causing heavy casualties to the enemy. Japanese air defense units and naval units are responding to the ground forces' operations by launching repeated attacks on enemy fleets, gradually expanding their war gains. The General Headquarters announced on the 4th that these results are only from the period between dawn on the 2nd and dusk on the 3rd. It was confirmed that between 5:45 AM and 6:00 AM on the morning of the 2nd, a unit of the Army Special Attack Force fiercely bombed enemy ships west of Okinawa Island, sinking two enemy cruisers and five large transport ships, and destroying one destroyer. At 6:00 AM, another unit of the Army Special Attack Force sank one large transport ship in the central sea off Okinawa. At 7:00 PM, another unit of the Army Special Attack Force fiercely attacked enemy ships near the Kerama Islands, sinking one battleship and two cruisers, and setting another ship of unknown type on fire. Based on these results, it can be seen that enemy ships near Okinawa have suffered significant damage. Combining previous results, a total of 170 ships have been bombed (including 4 aircraft carriers), 4 have been sunk or destroyed, and 79 have been damaged (including 3 aircraft carriers), for a total of over 190 ships.

### The Battle of Okinawa Island is Fierce and Prolonged; Director Cho Discusses the Pacific War Situation

The regular meeting of the Allied Japanese Fleet Reporting Department in China was held yesterday afternoon. Director Matsushima, Lieutenant Matsumoto, and many reporters attended. Director Matsushima elaborated on the Pacific War situation and the severe damage suffered by the enemy Americans. The following is an outline of his speech:

Heavy Losses of Enemy Vessels

The battles between the Japanese and American forces, centered on Okinawa Island, are gradually intensifying, and a portion of the enemy forces has already landed on the island. From the beginning of the American mobile fleet's air raids on Kyushu and Shikoku on March 17th to the American landing on the island, half a month has passed. According to enemy claims, there are a total of 1,400 ships operating on the front lines, including battleships, aircraft carriers, transport ships, and landing craft. The Japanese forces have launched fierce attacks on these enemy forces, using air units, naval units, and special attack units. As of April 3rd, most of these important ships used by the enemy on the front lines have been destroyed in the Japanese attacks, resulting in very serious losses for the enemy. On March 17th and 18th, the enemy forces that attacked southern Kyushu were forced to flee in disarray. However, the enemy continues to fight desperately. The significance of American losses can also be seen in the resignation of Paul McNutt, the director of the War Manpower Commission. In this decisive stage, the resignation of the director in charge of such an important task is because McNutt feels that the loss of manpower resources is too great.

Japanese Forces Utilize New Tactics

After the enemy landed in northern Naha, they advanced eastward, passing through the narrow isthmus and cutting it off, but this action has no major significance, because the entire Naha area is only 325 square kilometers, 60 miles long and averaging 7 miles wide, with a narrow and elongated terrain. The Japanese forces, whether at sea or on land, are fighting boldly and very bravely. This battle is only in its beginning stages, and it has already caused the enemy such significant damage. The enemy's tactics are the same as in the past, with air units and naval units cooperating, using naval gun fire to cover the landing of tanks. The Japanese forces are using new tactics to counter the attacking enemy and inflict heavy damage on them.

Japanese Military and Civilians Fight Courageously

The enemy will face many difficulties in future operations. According to General Holland Smith, the commander of the enemy's amphibious forces, there are difficulties in both supply and transportation, so he stated that future operations will be very difficult. In short, Okinawa Island is not comparable to Iwo Jima in the past. In future operations, under extremely intense fire, the grasslands will be turned into ruins, and the people of the mountainous Okinawa Island will cooperate with the Japanese Imperial Army and fight bravely. Even women's units are participating in commando attacks. The military and civilians are united in fighting bravely against the enemy. The enemy has clearly disclosed this situation in its reports. Also, in this operation, the enemy has appointed Lieutenant General Buckner as the head of the military government, imposing strict punishments on civilians who hinder the American military. The oppression of the local residents by the American military is so great, and the attitude of the local residents is self-evident.

The United States Opposes British Ship Participation

The participation of the British fleet in the Pacific operations was anticipated by us and we felt that it was realized too late. The participation of the British fleet in the operations does not represent an increase in combat power. In fact, it more clearly reflects the severe damage suffered by the American navy in terms of both military strength and manpower. The United States has always opposed the British navy's participation in the Pacific operations, partly because of its sense of superiority in numbers, and partly because of postwar political issues. The United States has strongly opposed British participation in the war, but the British navy is now participating in the battle of Okinawa Island, which shows that the Americans have no other choice.

In the future, the Japanese forces will use air units, naval units, and land units to more thoroughly destroy the enemy and establish a glorious victory. Moreover, given the strategic importance of Okinawa Island, it is bound to turn into a long-term war, resulting in tragic consequences.

False Propaganda is a Common Enemy Technique

Finally, regarding propaganda, Director Matsushima reported two points as follows: The enemy's reporting propaganda has its consistent techniques. In the past, the figures disclosed for their own losses were always less than one-tenth of the actual figures, while the figures for Japanese losses were increased by more than ten times. For example, on April 1st, the Chongqing broadcast reported that the American air raid on Shanghai resulted in the destruction of more than 90 Japanese aircraft, the falsehood of which is evident. The enemy recently launched strategic propaganda in Manila, especially targeting Japanese officers. However, the spirit of the Japanese people is completely different from that of the British and Americans, and the enemy's propaganda will ultimately be a futile effort.

### Naval Special Attack Forces Attack Enemy Ships

Southwest Base, 5th (Central News Agency Telegram) – On the night of the 3rd, Japanese naval special attack forces launched a suicide attack on enemy ships in the sea east of Okinawa. It has now been confirmed that one enemy destroyer has been destroyed.

### Germany Announces the Formation of "Werewolf Units" Striving for Freedom and Liberation

Berlin, 5th (Central News Agency Telegram) – On Easter Sunday, Martin Bormann, head of the Nazi Party Chancellery, issued a proclamation of "victory or death" to party members nationwide. Following the establishment of Werewolf units in enemy-occupied territories, the flame of the German nation was ignited. The proclamation of "victory or death" called on all party members to dedicate themselves selflessly. The formation of Werewolf units, aimed at freedom and liberation through a national showdown, is a major milestone in the history of World War II.

### German Resistance Strengthens on the Western Front; American Forces Advance in Two Areas

Berlin, 5th (Central News Agency Telegram) – Havas reports that a German military spokesperson stated that no major battles have occurred on the Western Front up to noon on Wednesday. German resistance has strengthened. American forces have only made significant advances in two war zones. An American tank column, heading from Bielefeld, has advanced north to Bad Oeynhausen. In the Lingen area, American vanguard units have crossed the Ems River and are advancing towards Sögel. The target of the advance towards Bad Oeynhausen is apparently Westphalia, which would cut off the Wiehen Hills and open up the North German Plain. The flanks of the anti-Axis forces on that route are repeatedly threatened, and many tanks have been lost. German resistance has strengthened in the Lingen area, and many American tanks and gliders have been destroyed near Coesfeld.

Berlin, 5th (Central News Agency Telegram) – The German News Agency reports that German forces have now retaken Ochsenfurt, located 16 kilometers southeast of Würzburg, thus confirming the reports of increased German resistance in various war zones.

### German Military Announces Eastern Front Report

Berlin, 5th (Central News Agency Telegram) – The German News Agency reports: The German military communiqué states that in the southern sector of the Eastern Front, Soviet forces continue to exert pressure between Deutsch-Drahndorf and the upper reaches of the Rabnitz River. German forces south of Vienna are fighting fiercely, intercepting Soviet forces advancing via Baden. Soviet attacks between Lake Neusiedl and the Danube River, and on the defensive line of Bratislava, were met with resistance after initial advances. In Upper Silesia, Soviet forces attempted again to break through between Breslau and Jägerndorf, but were repelled by German forces. Soviet forces continue to attack the fortress of Breslau, but Soviet forces that penetrated the western section have been encircled after fierce fighting. German forces on the west bank of the Bay of Danzig are fiercely resisting constant Soviet attacks.

Berlin, 5th (Central News Agency Telegram) – Havas reports that two Soviet forces advancing on Vienna and Bratislava from Hungary are progressing. The lines in central Slovakia, protruding too far east, have been automatically withdrawn for strategic reasons, and have not been pressured by Soviet forces.

Editorial

### Simultaneously Suppressing Speculation and Guiding Idle Capital

Yesterday's discussion on speculation and idle capital pointed out that the vast amount of idle funds currently in Shanghai have failed to be guided towards normal investment, instead tending towards high-profit speculation. Therefore, we advocate simultaneously suppressing speculation and guiding idle capital. Here, we elaborate further as follows:

The chaos in the market, primarily caused by the rampant activity of idle capital, is undeniable. Moreover, because idle capital speculation can yield exorbitant profits, those holding funds are no longer considering legitimate industrial and commercial undertakings, and everyone is rushing towards the path of speculation. On the one hand, the market is becoming increasingly chaotic, and on the other hand, the exorbitant profits gained by speculators are entirely plundered from the "big fish eat small fish" process that occurs in an instant. Therefore, the more volatile the market, the more small fish will fail and collapse, with increasingly tragic consequences. Affected by this, legitimate industrial and commercial enterprises are also speculating in the hope of profiting by chance. At the same time, major speculators—that is, those with vast amounts of idle capital—frequently resort to manufacturing and spreading rumors to create an advantage for their speculation. Therefore, if appropriate countermeasures are not quickly devised for the issue of idle capital, even if strict prohibition of rumors and suppression of enemy strategy are constantly proclaimed, in reality, it will inevitably be a case of "wildfires burn without end, the spring breeze blows and they grow again."

As mentioned above, the increasingly rampant evil of idle capital is actually due to the fact that although the authorities in the past spoke of strictly prohibiting speculation, they did not actually severely punish those who disrupted the market through speculation. As far as we know, the current authorities have already launched a close investigation into speculators who disrupt the market. Once evidence is found, they will inevitably be punished with the penalties they deserve, from which there will be no escape. We hope that the general public will earnestly report and assist the authorities in suppressing the sprouts of disorder. We believe that if a few big fish can be killed, the small fish will naturally restrain themselves upon seeing this!

Of course, suppressing speculation is a temporary solution to calm the market. At the same time, a fundamental solution is to guide idle capital towards normal investment, which is absolutely necessary. Otherwise, even if the current chaotic market can be calmed temporarily, there is still the possibility of a resurgence of troubles. First, study the reasons why idle capital is creating problems and take effective measures to prevent unnatural inflation of currency, to stabilize finance, which is essentially stabilizing people's minds. Because, without a doubt, the general public's desire to preserve the value of their currency is also a major factor fueling the evils of idle capital and speculation. Second, idle capital must be properly guided so that it is no longer concentrated in Shanghai alone, but flows to rural areas. Indeed, the inward flow of idle capital must first have a comprehensive and meticulous plan, ensuring that funds flow into the hands of every productive farmer, and not into the hands of disguised usurers, becoming tools for exploiting farmers' blood and sweat. Therefore, we advocate that Shanghai should take the financial community as its center and quickly discuss the organization of a rural loan syndicate, first providing agricultural loans to the rice-producing areas of Jiangsu. On this point, the Agricultural Loan Department of the Bank of Communications had considerable success in the past, and its handling experience can be used as a reference to formulate detailed measures. Third, we have consistently advocated increasing industrial and agricultural production. However, at this point, increasing production has become a secondary concern; the actual question is how to rapidly prevent production decreases and work stoppages. After severely suppressing speculation, the authorities must also point out a way out for fund holders. In addition to agricultural loans, they must also guarantee their investment in industry, mining, and legitimate commercial trade. On the one hand, how to improve transportation, increase coal shipments, and restore power supply to save Shanghai's industrial sector; on the other hand, how to thoroughly reform the securities trading market to make it a genuine way to guide idle capital to develop towards production. However, the current industrial environment in Shanghai is not easy to restore to its former scale. Rather than sticking to the old ways, it is better to seek a way out in the interior. Moreover, Shanghai's daily necessities industries mostly sell to rural areas in the interior, and for the sake of local sales, it is even more advisable to take the opportunity to relocate, which would also be the best policy in terms of business operations.

### Situation in Northern Burma

Chongqing-US Forces Suffer Losses

The 16th Division of Wei Lihuang's Yunnan Expeditionary Force, which is heavily valued by the Chongqing side, has been fighting fiercely with the Japanese army for about ten months since last May, when it launched a general counter-offensive on the Nu River front under the supervision of the US military, breaking through Wanmading and other places on the Sino-Burmese border, lured by the US opening of the Ledo Road. Due to the Japanese army's "bleeding tactics", it has been almost completely exhausted, and is currently gathering its forces north of Wanmading, trying to restore its combat power. During this period, according to Chongqing soldiers captured by the Japanese army, the Yunnan Expeditionary Force suffered as many as 150,000 casualties. It is reported that the initial frontline force of the Yunnan Expeditionary Force numbered approximately 600,000, but since the start of the second Nu River operation last May, it has lost 150,000 men. To reorganize its ranks, it has successively replenished over 90,000 men, but most of them are poorly trained rabble and not an enemy of the Japanese army. It has suffered great losses due to attacks by the Japanese army, and its morale is also low. The US side also stated that the construction of the Ledo Road has been fraught with difficulties. It is reported that the Ledo Road, from India to China, is 1,444 miles long, and along the way, there is a tomb of a US soldier for every mile. The American force involved in the construction of this road exceeds 15,000, of which 65% (over 9,750) are Black.

Japanese Take Advantage of the Night to Strike the Enemy

With the intensification of the battles around Iwo Jima and Luzon, the Burmese front, which has entered a decisive stage due to the enemy's general counter-offensive, is extremely active, especially in the area around Lashio in northern Burma, centered on the banks of the Irrawaddy River. The enemy's First Army is advancing in the area south of Hsipaw, while its 50th Division is gradually infiltrating 20 kilometers northwest of Lashio and southwest of Nanzi. The Japanese army immediately launched a major ambush battle on the banks of the Irrawaddy River, thus making the situation in northern Burma more tense. The Japanese army's actions on this front are all limited to the night, because enemy aircraft are rampant during the day, and even a piece of paper scattered in the forest can become a target for enemy aircraft. They will also indiscriminately bomb uninhabited villages, then pour gasoline when the smoke fills the sky, and even fly very low and drop spies by parachute.

As for the Japanese army's tactics, they fully adopt bayonet charges, avoid the eyes and ears of enemy aircraft, and specialize in nighttime actions. They take advantage of the dark nights to display the essence of surprise attacks. During the day, they wait in the jungle, hidden in secret. At night, they bravely maneuver around enemy positions, catching them off guard, and completing huge victories with small forces.

On the other hand, the Yunnan Expeditionary Force is advancing under the cover of heavy artillery fire and aerial bombardment from the US military. However, the Japanese army moves its positions every night, so that enemy aircraft bomb empty positions the next morning in vain, while the Japanese army suddenly carries out artillery fire on unexpected high ground. The Japanese army on the northern Burma front is thus deploying a solid ambush, taking advantage of the terrain of jungles where group actions of more than 100 people are impossible, and the fact that aircraft activities are less effective at night, etc., which are weaknesses of the enemy. (Translated from the Yomiuri Hochi, March 6-7)

Mr. Idebuchi, the director of the press department of the Allied Japanese Army, was invited to attend and provide guidance. Director Idebuchi arrived on time, accompanied by Lieutenant Maehara, Yokota, and Kai, and others. The following newspaper offices were represented: Osaka and Ichii from the Continental New Report, Xu Liqiu and Yang Huilang from the Chinese Daily, Ni Diesun from the Ping Bao, Chen Binsu from the Shen Bao, Jiang Xiaoguang and Zhu Yongkang from the National News, Chen Riping and Lu Feng from the News Report, Zheng Jie from the New China Report, He Daxiong from the New Shen Bao, and Qiu Shimu from the Shanghai Jiang Daily.

### Director Idebuchi Analyzes: Defects in the Enemy's U.S. Operations: Insufficient Manpower and Reduced Military Production

Director Idebuchi of the Japanese Army Press Department in this city, when meeting with foreign reporters yesterday, provided a very detailed analysis of the various defects in the U.S. war effort. The following is a record of his remarks:

Scaled-Down Shipbuilding Plan

On March 27th, the U.S. Navy Department announced that the warship construction plan had been scaled down. On the 29th, Secretary of the Navy Forrestal added, "This measure is based on a proposal by the Director of the War Mobilization Bureau and a detailed investigation of the manpower resources required for the entire military plan." Regardless of the truthfulness of his explanation, the recent shortage of manpower resources in the United States, the weakening of the existing fleet, and the severe shortage of steel are undeniable facts.

The recently regarded as the biggest problem of the U.S. Mandatory Manpower Resources Act can also clearly prove the panic of U.S. manpower. Roosevelt, disregarding national opposition, immediately requested the Senate to pass the bill that had been passed by the House of Representatives on the 27th, and warned, "It is hindered by operational guidance."

Manpower Shortage Affects Production

According to the U.S. War Production Board's announcement on February 26th, January's production volume decreased by 10% compared to December and was 20% short of the planned target. In terms of military production, whether it is ships or cannons, the target quantity cannot be reached. From this, it can be seen that the manpower shortage has affected heavy production and is enough to indicate the U.S.'s uncooperative attitude towards the war.

Recently, the British fleet has participated in the Pacific operations. This is naturally welcomed by the United States. However, today the United States no longer has the strength to support the war alone and has to rely on the British fleet. On the contrary, U.S. Under Secretary of State Grew has a good criticism of Japan's resistance, saying that Japan has the ability to increase the production of military equipment such as aircraft and armored vehicles, and the aircraft shot down by the United States are sufficient to replenish the newly built ones. There are currently four million military forces, and 250,000 soldiers can be added to the front line every year, while the number of Japanese troops killed or injured by the U.S. military cannot reach this number. Considering the enemy forces lost in Leyte, Luzon, and Iwo Jima, etc., are about 300,000 or more, it is firmly believed that in the highest tide of the war, we will be able to take the offensive, and for the gradually weak United States, we will raise the total strength to take up the shield and bravely kill the enemy.

### East China University Educational Fellowship Expresses Great Enthusiasm for the Free School

The students of East China University have enthusiastically participated in and contributed greatly to our newspaper's free elementary school. Now, we have received a letter from the Educational Fellowship of the school, expressing great enthusiasm and unlimited hope, and donating a large sum of money, books, and supplies, their kindness is deeply appreciated. The original letter is recorded as follows: "Ehrenburg once wrote about French society, 'On one hand, there is serious work, and on the other hand, there is debauchery and shamelessness.' However, why can't it be used as a portrayal of this time and place? When we see and hear that such a work is about to begin, sir, you know how much joy, how much happiness, and how much excitement we have! Shouldn't we do our best to dedicate our strength to participate in and help this sacred work? What we should be ashamed of is that our strength is so weak that it is almost impossible to talk about anything in the overall work. Accompanying this letter is not just this money and these old books, but also that great affection and unlimited hope. A few days ago, we mobilized almost all the students to take turns participating in helping the enrollment work of ten schools. Today, we are sending this money and these books. In the future, we are always ready to dedicate ourselves, forever. For ourselves, for others, we are indeed thinking this way and are willing to do so. Attached are a donation of 55,800 yuan, 436 old books, 5 western notebooks, a dozen pencils, a pencil box, and a pair of leather shoes. We respectfully hope to accept them."

### General Traffic Situation on the Shanghai-Suzhou Highway

— Jiaxi

The Shanghai-Suzhou highway has been in disrepair for many years due to war conflicts, resulting in many collapses east of Shanghai to Nanxiang and along the Waikuatang section, with the Zhongshan Road area being the most damaged.

Most of the bridges along the way are severely damaged, not only are the bridge foundations unstable, but the bridge planks are also completely scattered. Although some repairs have been made recently by a certain party, due to unsuitable materials and the temporary nature of the repairs, they are still unusable. Heavy military vehicles must unload their goods and cross the bridge empty, wasting a lot of time. As for cars falling into the river, it is also a common occurrence.

The places along this line include Zhenru, Nanxiang, Jiading, Waigang, Taicang, Kunshan, Zhengyi, Weishi, Waikuatang, Guanbinli, and Suzhou, a total distance of about 200 li: Shanghai to Jiading is about 70 li, Jiading to Taicang is 36 li, Taicang to Kunshan is 24 li, and Kunshan to Suzhou is 72 li.

In terms of transportation, Huazhong Automobile Company runs four buses daily, two to Jiading and two to Taicang, but they are sometimes suspended or canceled due to circumstances. Recently, several business companies have been established, which will be described in brief below.

Beihai Enterprise Transportation Company - Shanghai General Company is located at 290 Sixth Malu Road, and the Suzhou office is located at 100 Hengmalu Road outside Zhimen. It is entrusted by the Suzhou Automated Military Region of Huazhong Railway. Manager Qi Shaofeng. There are three large buses (large trucks with canopies and long benches): Fare: 3,000 to Nanxiang, 5,000 to Jiading, 7,000 to Waigang, 8,000 to Taicang, 12,000 to Kunshan, and 15,000 to Suzhou.

Haifeng Trade Transportation Company - The general company is located at Room 127, 400 Suzhou Road, and the ticket office is located at No. 1 Fu Lane east of the Taishan Road Empire Theater. Manager Zhu Zhenchuan has three large cars, one running to Changshu and two running between Shanghai and Suzhou. Fares are 3,000 to Nanxiang, 5,000 to Jiading, 6,000 to Waigang, 7,000 to Taicang, 11,000 to Changshu, 10,000 to Kunshan, and 12,000 to Suzhou. In response to the evacuation of the population, the company offers a 20% discount to passengers with evacuation association documents or those with "return to hometown" marked in blue on their movement permits, a move that is worth emulating by other companies.

Hezhong Automobile Company - 182 North Xizang Road (intersection of Kaitui Road), managed by Zhu Jiazhen, currently has more than a dozen charcoal-fired vehicles, specializing in chartered services to Suzhou and Changshu. The charter price per vehicle is 80,000 to Taicang, 120,000 to Kunshan, 168,000 to Changshu, and 180,000 to Suzhou.

Huatong Automobile Company - Located at the intersection of Guizhou Road, Second Malu Road, managed by Zhang Zhichong, has large vehicles and some small vehicles (all stored by car owners, and the business is based on account settlement), running the Changshu line.

Hujia Automobile Company - The business department is located at the north end of Xinzha Bridge, and the address is 480 Xinjiang Road, with about 50 small vehicles, specializing in Jiading, and also running to Suzhou or Changshu upon passenger request.

Linsen Automobile Company - Has two large cars running to Suzhou, Manager Wang Songhe.

In addition, there are Hailu, Dade, Hexing, and other companies, but they are still under investigation due to their recent establishment.

Luggage and small items are not charged, and large luggage is charged according to area and weight. Large buses can carry a maximum of 40 people with luggage, and small cars can carry a maximum of 7-8 people. The departure points are all at the doors of the respective companies, generally departing at 8:00 or 9:00 AM daily and arriving in Suzhou around 3:00 PM, requiring 7 hours. If there is a slight delay, it may take until 5:00 PM to arrive. Small cars can arrive in 4-5 hours due to convenient bridge crossings, fewer passengers, and fewer troubles. It is necessary to show a residence permit and be subjected to luggage inspection when passing through inspection stations along the way. Passengers must get off the bus at damaged bridges.

There are numerous large and small inspection agencies along the journey, and some are mobile. Starting from Shanghai, the inspection agencies are listed as follows: Jianghai Customs Zhongshan Road Branch, Police Bureau and Ministry of Finance Anti-Smuggling Office, Zhengfeng College Police Team, Yangjiaqiao Police Station, Zhenru Police Station, Hujiagou Grand Inspection Station in Jiading County, Nanxiang to Jiading checkpoint, Jiading West Gate Bridge Police Station and Security Team, Waigang Security Team Garrison, the Grand Inspection Station at the junction of Taicang and Jiading, Taicang West Gate Police Station and Security Team, Kunshan Grand Inspection Station, Kunshan East City Bridge Inspection Station, Kunshan Central City Police Station, Zhengyi Grand Iron Bridge Garrison Team, Wailutang Garrison Team, Weishi Station Ailu Team and Military Police Special Task Force, Guanbinli Tax Office (Water Patrol), Suzhou Station Inspection Station, and dozens of other places.

Business companies face many difficulties, one is that the cost is too high. Currently, each small car is worth about 2 million yuan, and large cars are worth 7-8 million yuan. It is not easy to purchase oil and tires. The black market price of oil is around 10,000 per gallon, and the price of small car tires is generally around 200,000 each, and the price of large truck military tires is more than 700,000 each. Second, the contact fees along the way are huge, reportedly accounting for more than 60% of the total operating expenses. Third, the various companies lack contact with each other. If a vehicle is damaged, those with few vehicles cannot continue the next day.
