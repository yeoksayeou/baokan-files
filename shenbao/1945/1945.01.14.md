### Northern Plains of Luzon Island: A Major Decisive Battle is About to Unfold; Japanese Forces are Filled with Fighting Spirit, Seeking to Annihilate the Enemy

Manila, Philippines, 13th (Central News Agency) – Enemy American forces have landed two infantry divisions and one tank division in Lingayen Gulf. They are currently expanding their bridgehead at the landing site, seemingly attempting to greatly reinforce their landing forces. On the 11th, at dawn, under the assault of Japanese naval and air forces, the third group of transport convoys intruded into Lingayen Gulf. To protect the enemy transport convoys within Lingayen Gulf, the enemy is using a small-scale mobile force, mainly consisting of several converted aircraft carriers, patrolling the western part of Lingayen Gulf. Meanwhile, east of Taiwan, they are disrupting the Japanese army's rear supply bases. Around the 9th, part of the enemy mobile force suddenly moved southwest, appearing to be heading towards the South China Sea, attempting to avoid attacks by the Japanese naval and air forces in the inner waters. The enemy forces that landed on the shore of Lingayen Gulf have been striving to maintain a portion of the bridgehead since the 9th. The enemy's land operations are gradually entering a formal stage. The left wing of the enemy forces that landed in Lingayen Gulf is gradually moving south, advancing towards Aguilar on the south bank of the Agno River. Their goal seems to be reaching the Agno River. In addition to using flame throwers, the enemy is also using rocket launchers, and some heavy artillery is being moved to the front lines. Japanese forces are filled with fighting spirit, awaiting the opportunity to crush the enemy. A major decisive battle is about to unfold on land in the northern part of the central plains of Luzon Island.

Tokyo, 12th (Central News Agency) – After the enemy American forces forcibly landed in areas such as San Fabian and Dagupan on the south bank of Lingayen Gulf on the 9th, they were subjected to fierce attacks by the Japanese army and air force. On the 9th and 10th, they continued to transport troops and supplies ashore. Currently, the enemy forces that have landed in that area possess two infantry divisions and a tank unit of about 100 tanks, forming the core of a tank division. They are actively building a bridgehead along the coast. Except for a unit spearheaded by tanks on the San Fabian front, which has made slight progress, there has been no significant overall progress. The enemy's landing point on the Lingayen Gulf front is entirely a poor-quality, humid area, hindering the enemy's operational actions. However, the enemy continues to reinforce its landing forces, and the enemy's third convoy is continuing to sail towards Lingayen Gulf. At the same time, elite Japanese ground troops are continuously attacking the landing enemy forces. Furthermore, Japanese "Fugaku" and "Kamikaze" special attack units of the army and navy, as well as special attack units formed by army aircraft, are launching attacks daily, fiercely bombing the enemy ships within Lingayen Gulf. Most of the Japanese aircraft are one-way trips. The results of the battles on the 9th and 10th were announced by the Japanese Imperial Headquarters on the 12th. The enemy's invasion operation in Lingayen Gulf has already suffered enormous losses.

### Japanese Army Launches Surprise Attack on Enemy Headquarters on Miyako Island

Tokyo, 13th (Central News Agency) – According to a dispatch from Stockholm (via Seoul), some Japanese soldiers on Miyako Island are currently hiding in caves and jungles on the island, awaiting the opportunity to fight the enemy, often causing great distress to the American forces. According to a dispatch from Miyako Island by the International News Agency, a unit of Japanese soldiers on the island is constantly appearing and attacking American barracks. In particular, three days ago, they broke into the headquarters of the American 11th Bombardment Squadron, which had recently moved from Saipan, causing considerable alarm. According to the report, the Japanese suicide squad only broke through the sentry line around the headquarters before being repelled by the American forces that quickly gathered. Therefore, the headquarters has been particularly reinforced in recent days.

### American Army and Navy Casualties Exceed 640,000

Lisbon, 13th (Central News Agency) – According to an announcement by the American Wartime Information Bureau on the 12th, the losses of American army and navy personnel since the start of the war total 646,380. Secretary of War Stimson also stated in a confidential conversation on the 11th that the losses of the army total 544,351, but the losses suffered from the German counteroffensive since December 16th of last year are not included. Therefore, the above figures represent only a portion of American military losses.

Capital Correspondence

### Mayor Zhou Xuechang Discusses the People's Livelihood in the Capital; Special Correspondent of This Newspaper

– Dan Ming

I have been in Nanjing for over a week. Seeing the fluctuations in prices in the capital, I cannot help but pay attention to the municipal government's administration. Therefore, on the morning of January 5th, I drove to the municipal government on Zhongshan North Road to visit Mayor Zhou Xuechang.

Mayor Zhou is from Baoding, Hebei. Before the Incident, he worked in the education and political circles for many years and enjoyed a high reputation. He served as the Director of the Education Bureau of Peiping and the Director of the Education Department of Shaanxi Province. He is a politician who dares to speak and act. Later, he was ordered to inspect the southeastern war zone. Dissatisfied with the dark political situation in Zhejiang and Jiangxi provinces at the time, he resolutely broke away from the Chongqing government. Coincidentally, the late Chairman Wang advocated for peace, and at the invitation of Mr. Zhou Fohai, he participated in the peace movement, serving as the Secretary-General of the Legislative Yuan. At that time, Chongqing had not yet learned of this. It is said that they even announced Zhou's appointment as the Deputy Director of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Border Region Administrative Supervisory Office. I had admired the reporter for a long time, but had never met him.

Upon meeting me, Zhou said, "I met President Chen of your newspaper once before the Incident. I will go to Shanghai at the end of this month and have a thorough discussion with him."

Commodity Circulation

"Does the Mayor often go to Shanghai?" I asked. "I rarely go to Shanghai usually," he replied. "Before, each trip would only cost 30,000 or 40,000 yuan, but now it would cost several hundred thousand!"

"Speaking of the current high cost of living," I continued, "I would like to ask about the general livelihood and economic situation of the capital."

"Let me give you a general overview," the Mayor said after thinking for a moment. "I came here to be mayor with the determination to prioritize the people's livelihood. Therefore, all materials here, except those controlled by the military and the Ministry of Industry, are not restricted in any way, and are allowed to circulate freely. As a result, although prices here have gradually increased recently, they are much cheaper compared to Suzhou and Shanghai." "Then," I asked again, "what is the situation with rice?"

"The rice situation is also better than elsewhere," he said, taking a puff of his cigarette. "The rice here is supplied by six counties: Jiangning, Jiangpu, Lishui, Liuhe, and Jurong. These six counties are all outside the military rice area, so there is absolutely no problem in meeting the needs of the general public."

Rationing System

"What is the quantity of rice rationed to each citizen?" the reporter asked.

"Four 'he' per person per day," the Mayor continued, "which can be said to be better than Shanghai. Moreover, the municipal government distributes all daily necessities allocated from Shanghai to the general public without any omissions, unlike some places where there is no rationing system and they are instead thrown into the black market for profit."

"However," the Mayor paused and said, "the allocation of materials in Shanghai is sometimes not very fair. For example, for sugar, Shanghai has already reached the 17th allocation, while Nanjing has only reached the 8th allocation, and even the price of the 8th allocation is the same as the current 17th allocation. Perhaps they mistakenly believe that Nanjing is the same as other places and does not implement a door-to-door rationing system!"

"I now completely allocate all materials to the citizens," Zhou said eloquently. "For example, cigarettes. Shanghai does not have household rationing, but here they are rationed in the same way as other daily necessities. The Allied economic advisors all believed it was unnecessary, but I still want to ration them, because this is the only way to suppress the external black market!"

"Mayor, you can manage the economy with this spirit," the reporter said, "truly benefiting the residents of the capital."

"It's not about benefiting," the Mayor said. "No matter what, I have to be responsible for the lives of the citizens as long as I am in office. Therefore, if the price of rice continues to rise in the next few days and the rationed rice is not distributed by the end of the month, I am prepared to open up the restrictions on rice circulation."

"What are the current restrictions on the movement of rice for residents of the capital?" the reporter asked.

"It's the same as Shanghai, one 'dou'," he replied.

Allied Cooperation

"Regarding the various economic measures you mentioned," the reporter asked again, "what is the level of cooperation from the Allies?"

"That is not a problem," the Mayor immediately replied. "They are very trustworthy. As long as the local officials do not want to abuse their power for personal gain, their assistance will be immediate. In this situation, Chinese and Japanese merchants are treated equally. For example, to conserve electricity, several stores that were using Japanese merchant licenses did not obey the orders. After the Japanese consulate police authorities were notified, they immediately went to seal them off."

"Mayor," I changed the subject again, "what are your thoughts on the current situation?"

"No matter what," Zhou said with a smile, "I always feel that Japan is our true friend, and the imperialistic practices of Britain and the United States should be opposed."

"Premier Koiso said in today's newspaper that the enemy seems to be shifting the center of the decisive battle to the Pacific," the reporter asked again, "I wonder what the Mayor thinks about the future of our country?"

Zhou said, "Is that so? If the war lasts too long, the people's livelihood in our country will really be unbearable."

By the time he said this, it was almost noon. When I said goodbye, Mayor Zhou gave me his personal phone number and hoped to have another in-depth conversation. I thought he was truly a mayor who treated newspaper reporters with the utmost respect!

### Enemy Ships Lost in Lingayen Gulf, Philippines: Fifty Ships Sunk, Destroyed, or Ablaze

Tokyo, 13th (Central News Agency) – From the 5th to the 10th of this month, enemy ships that intruded into the waters of Lingayen Gulf were sunk, damaged, or set ablaze by Japanese forces, totaling 56 ships. According to announcements by the Japanese headquarters and frontline reports, the enemy's losses are as follows: Sunk: 31 ships, including 20 transport ships, 3 aircraft carriers, 5 cruisers, 2 cruisers or destroyers, and 1 battleship.

Of the above-mentioned enemy ships, 33 transport ships fully loaded with military supplies were sunk or severely damaged within five days, resulting in extremely large losses in manpower and material resources. Furthermore, three aircraft carriers were sunk and four were severely damaged. The enemy's losses will have a profound impact on future operations.

A certain Japanese base on the Philippine front, 13th (Central News Agency) – On the night of the 13th, a Japanese submarine attacked an enemy mobile force composed of enemy aircraft carriers and battleships in the western waters of Lingayen Gulf, sinking one battleship.

Manila, Philippines, 13th (Central News Agency) – One enemy transport ship in Lingayen Gulf was sunk by Japanese forces on the 12th. Another was also sunk, and one was hit and caught fire, with flames visible from the land along the coast.

Japanese Kamikaze Golden Sword Squad Sinks and Destroys Enemy Ships

Tokyo, 12th (Central News Agency) – When the enemy landed in Lingayen Gulf, special attack units of the Japanese army and navy, as well as the air force, continued to fiercely bomb the enemy ships on the 9th and 10th. The battle progress that has now been determined is recorded as follows: The Kamikaze special attack unit Golden Sword Squad bombed the enemy fleet entering Lingayen Gulf around noon on the 9th, causing a large fire on one battleship and two cruisers or destroyers. In addition, two enemy cruisers and destroyers were sunk. At the same time, after destroying one enemy battleship, the Japanese air force continued to concentrate bomber attacks on the enemy fleet in Lingayen Gulf on the evening of the 10th, resulting in the sinking of one cruiser and setting fire to two cruisers and one transport ship.

### Japanese Ministry of Munitions Increases Power Plants

Tokyo, 13th (Central News Agency) – The Japanese Ministry of Munitions is determined to promote the construction of additional power plants. To complete them during the dry season, they have strongly promoted the final stage of construction. By the end of this year, 43 new power plants nationwide will begin generating electricity, nine of which were not originally part of the planned construction. This is due to the efficient use of labor and materials by those involved. During the dry season, concentrating on completing large and small newly built power plants will greatly contribute to the enhancement of the motive power for military production.

Weekly Commentary

### The People's Livelihood and the Evacuation of the Population

– Renjie

Shanghai is a city that has developed abnormally. Although it is a leading metropolis in China and a center of industry and commerce in Central China, it differs from other normally developed cities in the world. Its prosperity is mainly based not on its connection with inland China, let alone with the surrounding rural areas, but on foreign international trade. Whether it is commodities, raw materials, capital, or technology, they have all developed under this abnormal state. This, on the one hand, illustrates the contradictory nature of this "international" city, and on the other hand, it explains the difficulty of solving the various problems facing the city.

In recent years, maritime transport has been cut off, and land transportation has also been obstructed. Meanwhile, the population has surged, and the production and import of living materials have decreased, while the consumption of living materials has increased. This has provided an opportunity for unscrupulous merchants to take advantage of, and has become a hotbed for all kinds of profiteers. The hardship of the people's livelihood will inevitably affect social order. After the Greater East Asia War, the strengthening of the Baojia organization has made a considerable contribution to the maintenance of social order, but the entire problem cannot be properly resolved. Whether from the perspective of the people's livelihood or social order, "increasing production" is a necessary and urgent task; however, concrete strategies for this will take a considerable amount of time to take effect. The current problem of the people's livelihood and its resulting impact has reached a fairly serious level. Therefore, in addition to long-term plans, there is also a need for resolute and decisive emergency measures.

Naturally, a thorough solution to the people's livelihood problem awaits the victory of the Greater East Asia War, or at least the cessation of blind resistance. However, the Chinese people are the most kind and realistic: they only ask for the bare minimum conditions for survival, and their interest in politics is not very high. When their bare minimum survival needs cannot be met, they cannot muster enthusiasm for any "good governance." Though they may not speak out, they are hesitant in their hearts. Therefore, the current reality is: severe livelihood difficulties are enough to affect the Greater East Asia War, enough to affect the success or failure of construction in the peace zone, enough to affect the hearts of the people, and enough to affect the soundness of administrative agencies, the effectiveness of administration, and the many regular operations of various industries that are necessary in peacetime, and especially in wartime. The most obvious is the transportation industry, and other public services are also affected, so that the authorities' various facilities, although they have been carefully studied by various levels of government, often fail to achieve the expected results, and even often have the opposite, unnecessary, adverse effects when implemented. It has recently been reported that the authorities are considering thoroughly improving the rationing system and implementing a focused rationing plan to improve the people's livelihood, stabilize prices, and eliminate corruption. This may not be an inappropriate plan for adapting to the times, but if the root cause of the abnormal population concentration, the reduction of producers, and the increase of consumers cannot be effectively resolved, then its effectiveness will still be limited. Because economic and social problems cannot be solved solely by distribution. In the current decisive battle period, both military needs and civilian needs must be taken into account. When it is difficult to solve the problem of increasing production for a while, the rationing system should be improved, but if the supply problem cannot be solved, profiteers and extortionists will still have room to thrive, so no matter what, its effectiveness will always be limited. The phenomenon of layoffs in the industrial and commercial sectors is gradually becoming more widespread. The industrial and commercial sectors may have their own unavoidable difficulties, but this will further sharpen the contradiction of reducing producers and increasing consumers. Therefore, in addition to stabilizing prices, increasing production, investigating and punishing corruption, thoroughly investigating hoarding, and focusing on rationing... there is also a need for active population evacuation.

Most of Shanghai's population originally came from bankrupt rural villages, and more have come after the war due to poor social order in various places. This precisely explains why the citizens of Shanghai, whose standard of living is already at the highest peak in the country, have not universally evacuated, which also explains the difficulties of individual evacuation and voluntary return to their hometowns. Therefore, population evacuation must take planned steps, with group evacuation as the main method and individual evacuation as the supplement; proactively integrate production and construction into the evacuation work. The authorities should adopt methods of guidance, encouragement, and assistance, not just simply allowing them to return to their hometowns voluntarily, nor just advocating for publicity or forcing evacuation through administrative methods.

In summary, the difficulties of the evacuation work are mainly: (1) no way to make a living after evacuation, (2) poor social order in various hometowns, (3) various difficulties in transportation and the prevalence of extortion by bad military police, (4) due to the consistent mentality of seeking temporary peace among the citizens, they do not see the serious situation that is about to come, and thus drift along.

In response to the above points, we suggest several methods: (1) Prioritize the evacuation of enterprises, institutions, organizations, and schools that have a necessary evacuation. Once the center changes, it will naturally affect the direction of the entire citizenry. At the same time, it will also incidentally produce the effect of promoting prosperity in various places. (2) Under the advocacy and supervision of the authorities, the workers laid off by various industries should be organized by various industry associations, hometown associations, and other mass organizations to find appropriate destinations based on various possible conditions to organize production enterprises, or cultivate land, or trade, or run small-scale factories or handicraft factories. Governments at all levels should provide the necessary practical benefits and convenience. (3) Promote the "Return to Hometown" movement. Absolute convenience should be provided in transportation, and the government should instruct transportation agencies to ensure the safety of luggage transportation. Simplify all procedures as much as possible. (4) Population evacuation should become one of the main policies. Change the past practice of muddling along, and governments at all levels should provide guarantees and assistance to the work of various gold industry organizations. Use this as an important standard for assessing the performance of civil servants. Those who take advantage of the difficult times to poison the people should be severely punished. (5) The media, charitable organizations, welfare organizations, hometown associations, and other publicity agencies should immediately begin to study and promote this work and its detailed implementation plans, so that evacuation becomes a voluntary and active movement of the people.

In this decisive battle year, it is likely that the enemy will attempt to disturb the hearts of the people in the rear. I hope that all sectors will not take the issue of population evacuation lightly.

### Cabinet Meeting Decides Wartime Important Policies; Strive to Fully Complete Aviation Military Production

Tokyo, 13th (Central News Agency dispatch) – The Japanese cabinet decided on the "Five Major Decisive Battle Policies" on the 12th, which was announced the same day by the Japanese Information Bureau. Its aim is to align defense with general administration, and to implement policies swiftly, thereby establishing a unified military-political system and enabling the Central Supreme War Guidance Council to operate effectively. At the same time, the heads of local administrative councils, military commanders, and commanders-in-chief of naval districts must maintain close contact. Through the establishment and operation of these three-party committees, important policies decided by the central government will be forcefully implemented. Regarding communication between local administrative councils and the military, there have always been liaison councils in various localities, and military personnel and local officials or relevant parties have also been in contact from time to time. This measure aims to integrate the heads of local councils, military commanders, and commanders-in-chief of naval districts into a single entity. Central plans and policies centered on the Supreme War Guidance Council will be rapidly implemented according to local conditions, leveraging the nation's total strength to invest in aviation production to meet the needs of the front lines. Under this unified defense-production system, the government currently intends to implement measures including increasing aviation military production, increasing food self-sufficiency, and ensuring that the people strive to make all materials readily available to meet the needs of combat power. The Chief Cabinet Secretary is currently finalizing the complete plan, and its full picture will soon be clear.

The Japanese Government Decides to Submit a Foreign Capital Bank Bill

Tokyo, 13th (Central News Agency dispatch) – The Japanese government decided at a cabinet meeting held on the 12th to submit a foreign capital bank bill to the Diet. The main points of the bill have been released by the Japanese Information Bureau. Its main content is to achieve the completion of the Greater East Asia War, preparing necessary methods for raising foreign capital to streamline fundraising. At the same time, to adapt to future changes in the economic situation, enabling flexible operation is also an excellent way to realize smooth financial management. A foreign capital bank will be established with a capital of 50 million yen. Furthermore, the Japanese government is striving to streamline the abundant economic power of various parts of Greater East Asia, and the fundraising of necessary funds has been entrusted to the Southern Development Bank and other relevant financial institutions, which should allow for the concentration of funds. The main institution of the foreign capital bank will be located in Tokyo, and its main business will be the planning and utilization of foreign capital in accordance with national policy, in addition to handling government-specified loans, deposits, and other businesses, as well as managing relevant government-specified price investigation matters. With government approval, the foreign capital bank may handle a portion of banking and other businesses, and the surplus funds of the foreign capital bank will be transferred to the government. In addition, if there are losses in business operations, they will be compensated by the government.

### Western Front Ardennes Battle Enters New Phase; German Forces Retreat to East Bank of the Ourthe

### New Mayor of the City, Zhou, to Take Office Tomorrow; New Secretary-General Luo to Assume Office Simultaneously

The new mayor of this city, Zhou Fohai, is scheduled to take office at 10:00 AM tomorrow (the 15th). At that time, a handover ceremony for the new and outgoing mayors will be held at the City Hall. All bureau chiefs and senior officials of the City Government will attend. In addition, the new Secretary-General of the City Government, Luo Junqiang, and the Director of the Economic Bureau, Xu Jiang, will also assume office on the same day. Today (the 14th) is a regular weekly holiday, but all bureaus and departments of the City Government will work as usual to prepare for tomorrow's handover.

Farewell Tea Party by Colleagues of the City Government

Secretary-General Wu of the Shanghai Special Municipal Government was ordered to be honorably transferred to the position of Minister of Judicial Administration, and Chief Secretary Sun will also be honorably transferred soon. All colleagues of the City Government held a grand farewell tea party at the Hua Mao Apartments on the eleventh floor at 4:00 PM yesterday (the 13th) to bid farewell to Secretary-General Wu and Chief Secretary Sun. Secretary-General Wu and Chief Secretary Sun arrived on time. More than 100 colleagues of the City Government attended, including Ling Xianwen, Pan Da, Qu Xunyi, Shen Guanzhun, Liang Miaozhang, Zhang Enlin, Yuan Junchang, Sun Guangdi, Advisor Hibino, and Consultant Hirano Osamu. First, Councilor Ling Xianwen delivered a farewell speech, followed by Advisor Hibino, who delivered a speech on behalf of the Japanese staff of the City Government to thank Secretary-General Wu. Then, two commemorative silver plates were presented to Mr. Wu and Mr. Sun. Finally, Mr. Wu and Mr. Sun first gave thank-you speeches and then dispersed.

Secretary-General Wu's Acceptance Speech

Secretary-General Wu's reply was as follows: "In August of the year before last, I followed former Mayor Chen and assisted in the takeover of the former International Settlement and French Concession. Later, I was ordered to serve concurrently as the Director of the former First District Office and the Secretary-General of the City Government. During this short period of one and a half years, I completed the merger of the first and second districts and the merger of the City Government and the former First District, thereby promoting the unification of Shanghai's municipal administration. The significance of this move in the history of Shanghai's municipal administration and its impact on the future development of Shanghai are well understood by everyone and need not be elaborated. Recalling my tenure in the former First District Office, I am deeply grateful for the assistance of Chinese and foreign colleagues. Although our nationalities are different, we have the same purpose in working together and cooperating to promote municipal administration. I have always been sincere in my dealings and have strived to promote emotional harmony with a friendly spirit. These precious memories will never be forgotten. The Shanghai City Government is a Chinese administrative organ, but from another perspective, it has its own unique points. Therefore, the general administrative measures of the City Government require the assistance and cooperation of foreign technical personnel. If foreign personnel who have served in the City Government for a long time can continue to发挥their talents, the solution of various technical problems can be greatly facilitated. This is what I deeply hope for. In today's high-inflation environment, the treatment of all colleagues urgently needs to be improved, which should be noted by the authorities as soon as possible. In the past, under the orders of the Mayor, I once used the income from tax collection to increase subsidies for adjustment, but this move is only the initial step of adjustment, and is still far from the actual goal of improvement. I feel particularly inadequate in this regard and am ashamed of myself, and I hope that everyone will forgive me. Today, I am very grateful for everyone's warm hospitality, and I wish everyone a bright future and good health."

(2) In order to address the sharp increase in estimated revenue for the first half of the 34th year, it is proposed to discuss joint consultation methods, and to request modification of various tax rates in the first, third, and second categories. In addition to the first method listed in the fourth proposal, which concerns changes in tax regulations and should be discussed later, the remaining second and third clauses and the eleventh proposal will be discussed together and retained.

(3) In order to strengthen the administrative punishment powers of various bureaus and offices, it is proposed to determine enforcement methods to emphasize tax administration. It is requested that the Ministry be notified to instruct the provincial and municipal governments to order their subordinate police agencies to strictly enforce the cessation of business operations.

(4) The increase in tax collection quotas for the 34th year is huge, and it is difficult to handle. Now that the start of collection is approaching, it is proposed to allow the Ministry to issue clear instructions according to the established case of last year to facilitate tax affairs. It is requested that the office submit a report to the Ministry to issue a proclamation in advance, setting a deadline for payment, with severe punishment for those who delay.

(5) It is proposed that the office issue a circular to all district offices, limiting the time to uniformly implement the C-class income tax to increase national tax revenue and equalize the burden on merchants. The office should issue a circular to all offices to carefully handle the matter, taking into account the circumstances, to avoid suspicion of imposing excessive taxes.

(6) It is proposed that the office issue a circular to all district offices regarding the tax revenue of the 33rd year, ordering them to carefully audit and collect taxes and not to apportion or accept voluntary contributions. If there is any resistance or obstruction, it should be reported to the Ministry for legal action. It is also requested that the local chambers of commerce be instructed to inform all guilds to comply. The office should submit a report to the Ministry to instruct all offices and chambers of commerce to inform all guilds to comply.

(7) It is proposed that the office formulate a reward system for reporters of company mergers, reorganizations, dissolutions, closures, or transfers to facilitate tax collection. The office should formulate a reward system and submit it to the Ministry for approval.

(8) It is proposed to rectify the interest income tax on third-category deposits. Please submit a report to the office to the Ministry for approval.

(9) Because earth cream shops continue to operate as usual, it is proposed that the office issue a circular to all offices to tax them according to Class C for three months as a period to prevent merchants from evading taxes and increase income. In addition, for the Hongji Shantang and various earth cream shops and opium cessation centers in various parts of Central China, which were changed to commercial operations in April of the 33rd year, investigate the business situation. The annual development situation, and the large quotas for the 34th year, are of great importance and should not be neglected as usual. It is proposed that at the time of tax collection this year, the competent collection agencies in various places should conduct a serious investigation and report the collection, in accordance with regulations, to prevent concealment and emphasize the source of tax revenue. The office should issue a circular to all offices to comply.

(10) It is proposed to heavily reward informants to encourage them and prevent evasion and leakage. The office should submit a report to the Ministry for approval.

### Minister Tsuchida Hosts Banquet Yesterday for New Council Members of Shanghai Branch Association

First, Minister Tsuchida gave a speech, stating: Since I took office in November of last year, I have heard that the News Association was established in September. Due to busy official business, I have not had the opportunity to approach colleagues in the press. The establishment of the News Association has two characteristics: first, its nature is national; second, the colleagues participating in the association are all authorities in the press representing public opinion. Therefore, I place great expectations on the News Association to lead the people and enlighten culture in the future. The Greater East Asia War has now entered a decisive phase. The war in the Philippines is becoming more intense. The Japanese military has a Kamikaze Special Attack Force that sinks enemy aircraft carrier battleships or transport ships with one aircraft. The Japanese people are all determined to carry out the Greater East Asia War with the spirit of the Kamikaze Force's dedication to the country, in order to achieve final victory. I hope that your country's press will also lead the people to jointly achieve the final goal, etc. Then, Li Sihao, the new chairman of the association, stood up and gave a reply. The party ended happily at around 8:00 PM.

### Cattle-Powered Engine Applies for Patent

The Chinese Inventors Association, in view of the current limitations on factory power, urgently needs a remedy. After working with experts for days to research and develop a cattle-powered engine, which is a mixture of animal power and machinery, it is most suitable for five-horsepower and ten-horsepower. The propulsion of the cattle-powered engine is very strong, and it is cleaner and more suitable than firewood and charcoal. It costs only 500,000 yuan to install five horsepower. Its daily expenses, if calculated at eight hours per day, are only the feed for two cattle. Compared with firewood and charcoal, the ratio is ten to one. It is reported that a patent has been applied for from the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, and the authorities have been asked to conduct a public test.

### Continue to Distribute Sugar Once Within the Lunar New Year; The Current Quota Sugar Deadline is Advanced

This period is purchased with the 37th Comprehensive Ration Certificate, and the validity period expires on the 17th of this month. I hope citizens will pay attention. The reason for shortening this period by three days is that the Lunar New Year is approaching, and the office intends to continue to distribute sugar once after the end of this period, considering the customary need for sugar among citizens.

Reader's Scholarship Assistance News

### Reasonable School Fees, Hoping Authorities of All Schools Adopt Them

This semester has already ended, and schools will routinely begin winter vacation. After three weeks, the next semester will begin again. During this short period, which parent isn't worried about their children's tuition fees, except for a small number of wealthy families? They usually save every penny, and are already struggling financially. How can they not feel a headache when a huge amount of tuition fees suddenly appear? For example, if a family has three children in school, at the middle school, elementary school, or even at the university level, averaging twenty thousand yuan per person, it would require sixty to seventy thousand yuan to manage. Moreover, they are limited to paying it all off before the Lunar New Year. I think eight or nine out of ten parents will have to borrow money with worried faces. Where will they find generous relatives and friends willing to donate? The result will either be pawning clothes and jewelry, or turning to desperate measures. Since tuition fees vary from school to school, it is hoped that the authorities of each school will reduce them as much as possible. Parents will benefit greatly, and the gratitude will be immense! When school starts and tuition is due, it would be best to consider being accommodating, allowing installments to be paid or providing a certain number of half-fee slots, at least accounting for 10% of the student body. As for the school's finances, they should be transparent, and the treatment of teachers should also be reasonable. Salaries should be paid in three-month installments, and one semester should be paid in two installments. If this can be implemented, it will benefit both the public and the private sectors; it will be a clear conscience for the country and the people. Furthermore, the name "school shop" and the widespread complaints about principals enriching themselves can be swept away, bringing a glimmer of hope to the education system. It all depends on the principal's kind intention.

Strenuous Effort Troupe Enthusiastically Assists Education

A letter from the members of the Strenuous Effort Troupe states: "Dear Sirs, 'Strenuous Effort' is a troupe that only invests labor and has no financial foundation. We are a group of 'poor performers.' Our strength is very limited, but when we think of our peers who are blessed by the times, but are suffering to the point of not even having the opportunity to go to school, we can no longer consider our own weakness. Zhuangzi said, 'Fish stranded in a dry rut moisten each other with their breath and dampen each other with their saliva.' The one hundred thousand yuan we are sending is just a little bit of our mutual aid. Of course, the vastness of the river is what everyone is eagerly looking forward to."

(Note) All the members of the Strenuous Effort Troupe truly live up to their name, working hard for the art of theater. They enjoy meager rewards and endure hardship, occupying a glorious page in the history of drama. I remember that in October two years ago, when "Strenuous Effort" was founded, until the end of March this year, they performed six months of charity performances at the Paris Grand Theater for this newspaper's scholarship fund, performing plays such as " ", "Model Gentleman", "Double Happiness", and "Robot", which caused a sensation and achieved great success. Yesterday, they generously donated one hundred thousand yuan to establish a team. Your enthusiasm for helping students is a model for all theater troupes in Shanghai. Your high regard and deep friendship are greatly appreciated.

Shanghai New High School Exhausts Efforts to Solicit Donations

A letter from Shanghai New High School states: "Dear Sirs, since your newspaper established the scholarship fund, it has benefited the poor students and benefited society, which is deeply admirable. Now that the semester is changing, and funds are urgently needed, our class students have initiated a frugal scholarship fund movement to respond. Fortunately, with the help of parents and relatives, we have raised 156,000 yuan. It was decided that half of it would be sent to the News Report. We are honored to send it to your newspaper in the name of 'Shanghai New High School Class 2B Team' and 'Dai Ziyuan Team.' We are sending a check for 78,000 yuan with this letter as proof. This small amount is not enough to be of great assistance, but it represents our sincere heart."

### Special Attack Force: The Achievements of the Kaoru Airborne Troops

They finally did it! Landing in enemy territory and charging in, if possible, even taking advantage of the dark night to descend on the enemy's airfield and destroy enemy aircraft. This heroic so-called human beauty has finally realized the dream of impossible tactics. This unit, this terrifying unit, this incomparably proud unit, this fearless and invincible unit, is the special attack force Kaoru Airborne Troops. This is a melee unit that has never been seen before in war history, landing in enemy territory. It is not a night dream, nor an imagination. At the 〇〇 base, where enemy air raids were very fierce, reporters once lived and worked with this melee unit. Now, the reporters, with a full heart of emotion, are writing this report about the Kaoru Airborne Troops under the flickering light of the coconut oil lamp.

Destroying Enemy Aircraft, Leaving None Remaining

"The logic of destroying aircraft is the same as shooting birds. It is difficult for even the best shooters to shoot down every bird flying high in the sky. However, when the birds return to their nests, it is much easier to catch them. Aircraft are similar. It is not easy to shoot them down in the air. If you want to destroy a large number of aircraft, you can only do so on the airfield." Due to this great principle of aviation strategy, this extremely daring enemy landing aircraft destruction team was formed. Unlike paratroopers who land on uninhabited plains, they take large transport aircraft and land in the center of the enemy airfield. As soon as the aircraft lands, they jump off nimbly. As soon as the captain's order is given, they pounce like apes on the enemy aircraft on both sides of the runway or in the shelters, placing the strong explosives they carry on the important parts of the enemy aircraft. One after another, quickly and nimbly, the enemy aircraft on the airfield are destroyed cleanly in an instant, leaving none remaining. This is truly an unprecedented and ingenious unit.

Seeing in the Dark Night, Moving Like the Wind

The Kaoru Airborne Troops are composed of Japanese warriors selected from various units and special volunteer soldiers from Taiwan. The team members are all vigorous young people with an average age of twenty-four. They grew up in Taiwan, where the sun is scorching, the mountains are rugged, and the plains are green. From a young age, they have cultivated a strong fighting spirit to defeat the enemy. They are most skilled at moving in mountainous and dense forests, are not afraid of the scorching heat, are brave and aggressive, and take immense pleasure in participating in this battle. They also have a unique skill, which is the ability to see in the dark night. Their night vision is truly amazing! In the so-called dark night where you cannot see your fingers, they can usually see clearly thirty meters away. If they squat down and observe using a special identification method, they can see fifty or sixty meters away, and skilled people can even distinguish who a person is at a hundred meters away.

Not afraid of the heat, seeing in the dark night, moving like the wind. These are all most suitable for a surprise attack team landing in enemy territory at night. As for the vigorous spirit of attack, it is beyond words. Every team member has the spirit of fighting to the death. Moreover, they are disciplined, move quickly, and are all willing to dedicate their lives to the country.

Special Attack Force Captain Nakae Shigeo Lieutenant Junior Grade once told reporters about his subordinates, roughly as follows:

Sometimes, their behavior can be a model for us. They have great respect for people from the mainland, so we must not do meaningless things. A few days ago, the team was staying in a Filipino house. When the team members were cleaning the house, they found that a lot of vegetables had been forgotten on the veranda. They immediately sent it to the Filipino family who had moved away. The Filipinos did not have the custom of returning lost items, so they were surprised and delighted, and were very grateful. They insisted on sending pork, fruits, and other things to the team members as a reward.

A Treasured Sword, Killing Enemies

"All team members pride themselves on being Japanese citizens, and each has a volunteer sword. They are allowed to carry this sword. This sword, passed down from ancestors, is used very skillfully. The blade is only slightly less than two feet long, but after rushing into the enemy ranks, it will surely cut down several soldiers. They all know this lethal swordsmanship."

The Kaoru Airborne Troops, which are enough to terrify American soldiers, although composed of cadres and soldiers selected from various units and Taiwanese soldiers, were not hastily assembled recently. They began intensive training from the past 〇 month and have been waiting for an opportunity until today. Specialized training is conducted at night. The reporters had the opportunity to observe this rigorous night training several times, especially the training on the night before this attack, which was the most realistic and intense.

The Last Night Training

That night, the reporters obtained the captain's permission to report the training situation to the rear, so they used flashlights to illuminate the vicinity of the runway of the airfield where the night training was being conducted in the pitch-black night. Ah, there they are! Isn't that the large aircraft of the transport team? The training has already begun!

The door of the large aircraft opened silently. Now it is assumed that the enemy army airfield is landing for a moment. The captain jumped down first, with a white belt across his chest, forming a diagonal cross; it was the company commander. Next, the platoon leader, Lieutenant Junior Grade Suhio, also tied a white belt. The team members who jumped down one after another were wearing strong bombs on their chests, each of which could destroy an enemy aircraft, carrying enough food for 〇 days on their backs, and carrying guns and their heirloom sharp blades. Several soldiers were carrying submachine guns in their right hands.

As soon as he jumped down, the captain ran suddenly to about fifty meters away, and the team members followed the captain one after another. The captain conveyed the order in a low voice, designating the target. The attack began. All that could be seen were rapidly running shadows. The team members, holding explosives in their hands, ran separately to the imaginary enemy aircraft, jumped on the aircraft, set the explosives, and then scurried down like monkeys, continuing to attack the next enemy aircraft.

Everything was silent, and even the sound of footsteps was careful. Suddenly, there was a shout from behind. Then, the action training that the unit should have after being discovered by the enemy army began. A group rushed into the enemy ranks like asuras, and another group seized the opportunity to pounce on the enemy aircraft. The attack ended, and everyone rushed to the pre-designated target location, crossed the jungle like apes, and reported the results back to the base. (Translated from the December 4th Mainichi Shimbun)

### Center of the Philippine Islands Campaign

The biggest purpose of the enemy Americans landing on Mindoro Island is to establish a strong airbase. There was an airfield near San Jose before the war, and now the enemy is using it as a center, constructing several other airfields to gather large aircraft and fighters. Although the enemy Americans suffered heavy losses on Leyte Island, they are still launching a new landing operation south of Ormoc and adopting an offensive posture. They are also advancing towards Mindoro Island with a strong fleet and transport convoy. From this perspective, it is possible that the enemy Americans, relying on their abundant supplies, will land in new locations in the future.

Leyte Island is Important

The ground battle on Leyte Island is extremely fierce, and the enemy Americans are launching offensives everywhere. On the other hand, they are also trying to consolidate their position on Mindoro Island. This strategic arrangement is clearly intended to take advantage of the gaps and expand the breakthrough. As Japan concentrates its forces in the future, the Philippine Islands campaign may become more intense, and the future cannot be overly optimistic. However, whether the enemy's tactics can truly exert their power depends on the future development of the war situation.

We calmly judge that the enemy army is only trying to maintain this posture, regardless of heavy sacrifices, which shows that the overall situation of the Philippine Islands campaign is not necessarily favorable to the United States. Moreover, the enemy Americans' forces are dispersed, and the Japanese army has an opportunity to take advantage of. The enemy army's landing on Mindoro Island was not a predetermined step in the enemy Americans' operations in the Philippines, but an accidental operation caused by the stalemate on Leyte. Even in the United States, it is believed that this move is extremely risky, and the future is still difficult to predict. MacArthur, in order to break the stalemate on Leyte, had no choice but to ignore everything and rushed into Mindoro Island.

The stalemate on Leyte was unexpected for the enemy army. Based on the experience of Saipan, the enemy Americans believed that they could take it in one fell swoop with their naval power and abundant military supplies, end the war in a short period of time, and establish a base to sweep through the Philippines. But to their surprise, in the two months since landing, their biggest goal of establishing a land-based airbase could not be achieved. Instead, they lost the Broyon and Samba Pablo airfields that they had initially captured. The Teler airfield was also unusable due to the Japanese army's counterattack. To date, only the Tacloban airfield has forty or fifty small aircraft.

Aircraft Production is More Important

The enemy Americans' operational goals have clearly failed. The Japanese army's land forces' attacks on Morotai Island, the damage to the enemy Americans on the waters of Taiwan and the Philippines, and the kamikaze attacks have all been unexpected obstacles for the enemy army. This is the biggest reason for the stalemate on Leyte. In the future, even if the enemy army achieves some success in the ground battle on Leyte, it is not related to the enemy army's ultimate goal of making Leyte a base. For the enemy army, it is simply a waste. The landing on Mindoro Island was a risky move made out of anxiety and disappointment by the enemy Americans. Its supply line is very long, and if the Japanese air force is still alive, it cannot be allowed to run rampant. Therefore, we must not be confused by the battle on Mindoro Island and must pay attention to the development of the Leyte campaign. The biggest goal of this battle is to defeat the enemy army on Leyte Island. The victory on Leyte is the victory in the Philippine Islands campaign. Mindoro Island is just an orphan surrounded by the Japanese army and is easily resolved. The problem is that even with the insufficient air power on Leyte, it is now necessary to allocate a portion to deal with Mindoro Island. Therefore, the production and replenishment of aircraft are even more important, and the rear production camp needs to step up its efforts. (Translated from the December 22nd Mainichi Shimbun)

Here is a careful English translation of the provided sections from the historical Chinese newspaper, *Shen Bao*, preserving whitespace:

### Japanese Navy Gunnery School 1

The Japanese Navy Gunnery School is an institution for mass-producing young commanding officers for the Japanese army's land warfare and air defense. It is like a factory forging refined steel, creating countless military talents through rigorous training.  It is urgently necessary to cultivate capable young officer candidates for aerial and fleet battles; and strengthening land warfare and air defense forces to repel enemy troops and drive away enemy aircraft is even more crucial. Therefore, the special feature of the training at the Gunnery School, which cultivates young commanders for land warfare and air defense, emphasizes education, and all students cultivate a spirit of certain death in rigorous training.  Many students come from arts and law backgrounds, but their eyes are clear as crystals, without a trace of selfish thoughts. They act in unison as soon as they receive a noble order. In just a few months, no trace of students can be seen on any face; instead, they are transformed into excellent naval personnel.

Air Defense Drill

While intense training in enemy landing and waterside interception is unfolding on the coast, high-angle gun operation training has also begun in a corner of the bare mountain to the south.  Around the giant high-angle guns, the reserve officers are at their stations. "Air combat! "Advance left, Grumman, altitude ○○, fire!" As the command rings out, the reserve officers move as quickly and accurately as machines.  With a deafening roar, the giant gun roars into the sky, and the loading mechanism immediately opens.  One person removes the cartridge case, another loads the shell, and a new shell slides into the gun chamber. There is no hesitation, no disparity, they move like well-oiled machinery.

"What? Already exhausted?"

"No." The answer is like anger. How bright the sound!

A high-angle gun that can fire ○○ shells weighing □□ kilograms per minute can be operated by only □ people. Moreover, there are no relief personnel, because on the front lines, even if only one gunner remains, he must load and fire the gun alone. Therefore, there are no relief personnel in the air combat here. The training is rigorous and intense, with the aim of ensuring that even in such unfavorable environments in the future, they can resolutely continue the fight to shoot down enemy planes.

Spiritual Training

Thus, the reserve officers diligently learn various gunnery operation methods, searchlight and anti-aircraft light operation methods, anti-tank warfare tactics, aircraft identification, and command methods in this rigorous training.  Simultaneously with air defense combat training, there is also combat training in dark nights and dense forests, as well as special waterside combat.  Like good blotting paper, they learn the practical training of land warfare from all angles.  During this period, their character is also cultivated, so that they possess the temperament that a Japanese naval officer should have.  Every reserve officer is forged into a flawless great man of the sea, both spiritually and physically.  The commanders of land warfare and air defense are like Japanese swords without the slightest bump.

In the quiet night with the faint sound of the tide, the reporter asked the reserve officers during self-study time about their current state of mind and their hopes for those who follow.

"The most important thing is to abandon self. I hope the younger generation will do the same," replied Mr. Soya Aoki (graduate of the Faculty of Law, Dada University).

"We are all deeply moved by the heroic struggles of the Kamikaze Special Attack Force. We also fervently hope to follow the Kamikaze team in the battle for land warfare and air defense. And we hope that future generations will be robust and continue to be reserve officers," said Mr. Masakazu Takahashi (graduate of the Faculty of Law, University of Tokyo).

"The joy of directly charging and killing enemy soldiers is supreme. All the younger ones, as long as you have passion and spirit, you can do well. In the past, I didn't understand the concept of life and death, and it was difficult to decide on my own direction in life. After coming here, my heart suddenly became clear, and I felt that dying for the motherland was nothing," said Mr. Tamotsu Miura (graduate of the Faculty of Law, Kyushu University).

The other answers also expressed the same loyal and pure heart, wishing to leave a legacy for posterity.

Practical Experience

As for the instructors who train this group of pure young men, they are also very young, ranging from twenty-two to thirty years old, and are all officers who graduated from this school as reserve officers. Among them, such as Major S, Lieutenant K, Lieutenant E, Lieutenant F, etc., survivors of the Solomon campaign, almost all have experience in New Guinea, New Georgia, the Philippines, or northern operations.

Lieutenant K told the reporter: "The reserve students and students initially enter the school with excited feelings. They have knowledge and education, but they lack the ability to execute, so they feel very painful inside in the short term. However, after rigorous training, they no longer have the concept of students, and forget everything about themselves. I think that land warfare and air defense are fundamental battles, just like pickled vegetables cannot do without a pickling stone, but even with it, you can't see any obvious effect. In short, with land warfare and air defense, we can establish naval and air combat results." (Correspondent Quente) (Translated from the December 2nd *Mainichi Shimbun*)

### Symphony of Poverty and Illness

— Ren Shufang

Sunday is supposed to be the only day I can relax in my life. I ate a bowl of noodles haphazardly in a noodle shop, thinking about Yi Ping whom I hadn't seen for a week. I had no desire to return home. This room, which couldn't be any smaller, was filled with all kinds of daily necessities, and I was too lazy to tidy it up. Leaning on the bed, I lit a cigarette out of boredom. The door opened, and Yi Ping came in.

I jumped up and threw away the cigarette. The early winter sun shone in faintly. I watched Yi Ping's golden, silky curly hair being kissed by the sunlight. In a familiar gesture, she pulled her hair with her hand, avoiding my eyes, and slowly tidied up the mess on the table for me.

Strolling down the street is our weekly task, and today is no exception. As soon as we left the house, we turned onto several streets and arrived at Jing'an Temple Road. This is the most suitable road for walking. We talked about our professional situations. In the past, we loved to talk about eating and playing, but now that I have become a failure on the economic front, I am afraid to mention money. Yi Ping also knows that I am financially strapped, so she avoids talking about these extravagant things. Slowly, we talked about the weather. From the weather, we talked about clothes. Yi Ping told me that she wanted to make a long wool coat, preferably dark blue, with a generous style and a not too expensive price. Originally, we were talking in a question-and-answer manner, but now I was silent. The store windows were plastered with sale advertisements. Models were wearing new early winter clothes, showing graceful postures, attracting passersby who were winking at them and sighing. Finally, Yi Ping also stopped enviously in front of a fashion company. In the window, there was a navy blue coat. According to Yi Ping, the texture of the fabric met her ideals. The price tag on the coat, with white letters on a red background, was 16,000 yuan. Yi Ping happily sought my opinion. I had to nod reluctantly, and my heart gradually became uncomfortable. I hated myself, hated this fashion company, and hated this world even more. After ten minutes of lingering, Yi Ping realized that she did not have the means to buy this coat, and silently dragged me forward. She was disappointed because she could not get what she loved, and I was uncomfortable because I could not satisfy the desires of the person I loved.

After a long silence, Yi Ping sighed and said, "Maybe I will never be able to afford a coat in my life!" I suddenly flared up, feeling that her words were extremely insulting. I said with a sneer, "Blame yourself for being blind and falling for a poor wretch like me," and couldn't say a second word. I turned and walked away, despite Yi Ping's constant screaming for me. I didn't look back and ran home in one breath.

Three years ago, I graduated from university and found a position in a bank. That year, I got engaged to Yi Ping. At that time, I was full of youthful pride. I had graduated from school, found a job, and succeeded in love. What else could I say?

Just entering society, I was full of hope, believing that I had a bright future. My parents died early, leaving me an estate that was not much, but still considerable. I grew up in the arms of my widowed aunt, who loved me like a mother. For many years, I studied in Shanghai, and she never cut off my money, giving me as much as possible to spend. There was a lot of land in the countryside, which ordinary people thought would never run out. On the one hand, I worked hard to study and disciplined my body and mind. On the other hand, I was very proud that I had so much property. If I could have a decent profession, plus these family properties as a backing, then my future would be very optimistic. I deeply believed in myself.

Yi Ping also had no parents and lived in her brother's house. Although her sister-in-law didn't treat her well, her brother really loved her. So, this pair of orphans loved each other, hoping to create a bright future together. At first, human relations were very happy. Yi Ping was a teacher in a school. We agreed to work hard in our respective careers, save money, and budget that in three years, we could accumulate a sum of money for our wedding expenses. A year passed quickly! I gradually felt an economic threat. Because of inconvenient transportation, the money from my hometown always came very late. Under these circumstances, I had to use my salary to maintain my life. The high-speed rise in prices made me try my best to catch up, but I always fell behind. Since this year, according to a letter from my aunt, my hometown is experiencing a drought, and the fields have yielded nothing. Life in the countryside is also very difficult, and there is no money to send out. When I received this letter, I felt like I had been hit hard on the back, and a kind of fear grew in my heart. Coupled with the recent living standards, I was even more breathless. I had heard friends' advice to run to the stock market, but when I saw the ups and downs of the prices on the blackboard, the sweat on people's heads, and the hoarse shouts, I left there dejectedly. I thought I would definitely get heart disease in that kind of place, and I didn't have the courage to speculate, so I became poorer day by day.

Men seem to have a kind of nature, which is to spend money for women, even if they are poorer themselves, and the money comes harder, they must pretend to be "lavish and unsparing" in front of women. If a woman accidentally takes out money, the man feels unhappy, even feeling it as an insult and contempt. I also tried my best to pretend to be nonchalant in front of Yi Ping. The clever Yi Ping had already known that I had this kind of hidden pain, but she was unwilling to expose it, for fear of hurting my self-esteem.

She often secretly added all kinds of food and supplies for me, trying her best to avoid making me feel poor and unhappy. Although she had her brother to provide for her living, she didn't have much money saved up. She had never complained to me about being poor, and I had never complained to her about not having money to spend. We were both reserved and understanding.

After arguing with Yi Ping, I cried all night. New and old sorrows flooded my heart. Money, it's all because of money. I tossed and turned on the bed all night, and couldn't get up at dawn. I fell asleep in a daze, and when I woke up, it was almost noon. I had fallen ill like this. I was sleeping alone, and no one came to ask about me. Now I was eager for Yi Ping to come, and I was willing to admit my mistakes and repent in front of her.

In the afternoon, my head felt like it was about to explode, and my mouth was as dry as anything. I wanted to struggle to get up and pour a glass of water, but I was so dizzy that I couldn't stand up, and I fell back on the bed in a daze. In a trance, it seemed like someone was walking in front of my bed. When I opened my eyes, it was Yi Ping, whom I was thinking about. I felt a pang of sadness in my heart and started to sob. She stroked my forehead and wiped my tears. I wanted to apologize to her, but I couldn't say a word, just kept sobbing. She poured me a glass of water to drink, and then went to buy porridge and vegetables, and fed me with a spoon. She said, "I know you are suffering because you are unwilling to give up this kind of vanity. Your temper has been so bad this year because this year is the year we planned to get married. You don't have money, and you are unwilling to tell me, but I knew it a long time ago!" She paused slightly and turned on the electric light.

"In this day and age, I don't know how many young people are living painful lives under psychological contradictions. But having money doesn't represent success. Maybe they commit sins for money and let their descendants suffer the consequences. Women seem to love money mostly, but you can't say that every woman loves money. Although the current world is a world of money, I also want to be particular about material things, but when I think of the threat to life and the difficulty of earning money, I immediately dismiss those thoughts. At first, I always felt a little sad. But when I thought of the poor laborers and the starving beggars, I immediately felt enlightened. In the end, right and wrong overcame vanity. The first three-year plan has failed. There is also a second three-year plan. We are so young, it doesn't matter if we get married three years later. Remember, life has to be fought for!"

Yi Ping served me the porridge, said she would come back to see me tomorrow, and then went back, leaving behind an empty room and an empty me.

Three years ago, I had a fantasy that I wanted to earn a lot of money and dress Yi Ping as a noble woman. When we walked in and out hand in hand, I wanted others to cast envious eyes on us.

Today, I suddenly remembered this thing again, and I smiled bitterly! But, I think there are still three years!

### Snow

— Lan Yu

1

I am not a talented scholar who composes poems in a warm pavilion. When I want to look for plum blossoms, I am naturally not a recluse who "rides a donkey over a small bridge and sighs alone at the slenderness of the plum blossoms." I am just an ordinary person in the world who has to get up at dawn every day and hurry on the road for the sake of life. For this reason, snowy days are of no benefit to me.

2

To be honest, I really don't have a good impression of snow.

Naturally, like others, snow also brought me a vague memory. In that memory, the spring snow of my old home arose, lowering the plum branches...

But people don't live in memories forever. What is before us is reality.

3

I walked on an uneven road in the snow.

I began to feel disgusted with the snow. Several times I tentatively stepped on a soft white snowflake, and several times I was splashed with dirty water from under that snow.

People know that snow is pure and beautiful, but they only see the surface.

4

Therefore, I prefer "sleet."

Sleet is certainly not as beautiful as dry snow, but it melts as it falls, and everything is still clearly visible, so it won't trick travelers.

So I thought that those who sing the praises of snow's beauty must be empty talkers who strike a high note!

5

Here is another charge against snow.

There was a relatively high spot in the snow, and when I stepped on it, I found it was a straw bag with an abandoned baby inside.

I felt a chill. Snow is the cover for all sins.

6

A child fell in the snow, and when I wanted to help him up, I almost slipped myself.

"You can't do good," S said from the side.

"If that's what it means to be a good person, I'd rather fall a few more times," I said.

But there are almost no such good people in the world.

7

The children and I were busy building a snowman in the courtyard.

"What's the point?" One child said with worldly wisdom, "As soon as the sun comes out tomorrow, it will melt right away. It's all for nothing."

So I set a truth for the children.

8

In the evening, the snow was still falling. The streetlights were dismal.

"A traveler returning home on a windy and rainy night," I whispered.

So we thought of that lonely, weary traveler, Wei Liansheng, a traveler returning home in the wind and snow. Silently, we listened to the rustling sound of our feet on the snow.

9

L came from Southeast Asia and had never seen snow.

"Tomorrow I must find someone to take some pictures. I have never seen so much snow."

"Poor person," I thought, "If you see the many days in the north, when you see that vast expanse of ice and snow, what will you do?"

10

"Do you think it will still snow tomorrow?"

"No," I looked at the gray sky,

To be honest, I really don't want it to snow again, because I don't have a good impression of snow.

I hope there will be a good sunny day tomorrow, and return the world to its original shape! (34, 1, 8, Snowy Night)

### Twilight Fireside

— Sang Zi

I tell stories to Jin Minzhi. This child has superhuman imagination; she listens with rapt attention and adds her own opinions.

I tell her the story of a couple who sacrificed their own lives for each other when a ship sank in the ocean. Her glittering eyes almost filled with tears, and she said softly:

"I really don't know what I should do."

I tell her about a prince and princess from the Middle Ages, and she forgets the sadness given by the previous story. She becomes happy, and shows a smile, saying:

"I like their clothes."

Because she has seen a cartoon about a prince and princess myth. Those medieval knights and beautiful women's clothes.

When I finish the story, I am about to say goodbye and go back. At the door, Jin Minzhi follows up with light and quick steps.

"Go back later. There's no one at home," her eyes carrying some pleading.

I myself hate loneliness. In the twilight of dusk, loneliness is a kind of demon.

"What should we do? The stories are finished."

I help Jin Minzhi chop up thin firewood in the garden, we move it into the house, and light a fire. Jin Minzhi wants me to sit by the stove, and says:

"Let me do something for a while, and then keep you company and chat."

I curl up by the roaring fire, making endless explorations of thought. I open my eyes and see Jin Minzhi busy. And so I laugh.

She sees my smile. When she finishes her work, she sits down by my feet, and looks up to ask:

"What's so funny?"

I stroke her hair, and reply:

"I feel that I am very happy, because now the two of us are the masters of this quiet and warm house."

She lowers her head in silence. Our faces are both reflected with the red light of the fire; we breathe the air of happiness.

"I love a kind of stove that has a door like a lattice window," Jin Minzhi has a gentle voice.

"Lattice windows blazing with red light breed fantasies."

"What are you looking at?"

I discover that twilight has already completely crept into this house. In the corner of the room, the stove fire reflects two young faces, truly a moving picture. Jin Minzhi leans by my feet like a clever but timid kitten, and I touch her plump cheek with my hand, saying:

"Are you afraid of the dark?"

She raises her head, two black and bright pupils, like gems, and says as if reproaching:

"Why let the darkness threaten us?"

I feel somewhat ashamed. But I also open my eyes wide, and we stare at each other for a long time.

The stove fire gives light, and also gives warmth. Although it is silent, we are not at all lonely.

### Birthday

— Steve

A trace of novelty cannot conceal the roughness and yellowness,

The calendar again stands upright,

For no reason, a few bloated numbers are tossed out;

Another gust of light wind,

Where does it blow the fallen petals?

I once cried out in shock at the first contact with water,

But now I am forever swimming in a turbid sea,

I have exhausted the bottom of the deep sea;

Only today in the dangerous waves,

Struggled for something——

That is my true self.

Let's tap the glass and bring it to our lips,

Sip this drop of bitterness;

Pick up a few charred noodles,

I am willing to reach into the plate,

And dip them in a little spiciness and sourness.

### A Pair of Worn-Out Leather Shoes

— Ling Zuren

The pair of car tire-soled leather shoes on my feet already have a hole, and the car tire soles have long been worn thin by the long years!

Many people have told me that I could change to a new pair! Yes! I have already prepared a new pair of leather shoes.

But; I don't necessarily "love the new and despise the old." In fact, the "new" ones are temporarily "put aside," and my feet are still hitting the road in that pair of worn-out leather shoes every day, calmly running and walking...

Many people are puzzled by my not wearing the "new leather shoes," but I find that the "worn-out leather shoes" are very comfortable on my feet, so I don't bother to care about other people's puzzlement!

When that pair of "worn-out leather shoes" was bought, they were, of course, brand new! Black orange-peel-like shoe surface, thick car tire soles; the price was thirty-six yuan, which sounds like a joke now, but it was considered a lot of money at the time!

However, to be honest, the distance between that time and the present is not so far apart as to require calculation in centuries!

I remember that whenever I wore them at the time, I always carefully applied "Kaihui shoe polish" to make them shine, and if I were to calculate the price of "Kaihui shoe polish" now, then that expense would have been enough to buy several dozen pairs of such leather shoes back then with money to spare.

Of course, the shoes have long lost that kind of luck now.

At that time, they often accompanied me as I danced in the brightly lit dance halls, and they were also used to step on the soft green grass while strolling. In addition, they were sometimes splashed with rain after drunken evenings, but they were also caressed by the spring sunshine many times...

They shared joy with me, but they also endured the hardships of travel...

No one can escape the aging of years. The shoes finally fell into their current dilapidated state. The past joys can no longer be continued. Even I have long lost my interest and have disappeared from the pleasure-seeking venues! If I didn't remember the old affection now, then the shoes should have long been hidden in the trash to spend their desolate years of "natural sadness"!

Fortunately, I don't care about their old age now. I still let them follow my feet peacefully day and night, and I can relive the distant, warm old dreams from them. Therefore, I very much hope that this mutually beneficial situation can be prolonged...

But, I can't permanently "grow old in this village." In that case, "a great journey" would probably not be something that pair of worn-out leather shoes can handle! Therefore, how many days they can still follow me in the future is something I can't even be sure of myself!

### After Two Losses by Tung Wah, Hopes are Placed on the League Team to Win the Championship

In this year's football league, Tung Wah has already suffered two losses, first to Portuguese merchants and then to Qiu Wendu, making it difficult to regain the top spot. Their past glory has now flowed entirely to the east, making it difficult to fathom their current state. Now, we can't help but place great expectations on the League team, which has never suffered a defeat. Observing the tireless efforts of the older players and the satisfactory performance of the younger players, there is indeed a sign of revival. Therefore, general fans are wondering whether the League team can ascend to the championship of this year's league.

My personal opinion is that I have always loved Tung Wah and the League team. This is definitely not because I don't appreciate Tung Wah's hard work, but because I admire the outstanding skills of the players in the League team. If they could have acted cautiously earlier, with their talent, it would have been a fact to promote their reputation in Shanghai long ago.

Looking back at the League team's defeat in the previous league, the main reason is well known, that is, the players' spirit was not good, they rarely practiced, and most of them lacked energy. How can they succeed? The success of a football team depends first on talent, and also on spirit and energy. If all three of these are available, then the performance of a team will undoubtedly be loved by the public.

Regarding this year's League team, since the return of Luo Shoufu on the front line and the progress of Zhou Qilin, coupled with its consistently solid defense line, the League team can be said to have all the necessary talent. As for its spirit and energy, because the authorities, in view of the disorganization of the previous league, have focused on accommodation for the team, which has been quite effective, so I believe that the League team should take the prestige of Tung Wah in the previous league and replace it this time.

Speaking of its record, it has already defeated the Overseas Chinese League. In the future, there are still two major rivals, Portuguese merchants and Tung Wah. Whether the League team can defeat them in one go cannot be inferred. Now I might as well talk about their current situation, which is also to hope that they can make further progress.

Liu Xianhan

Seems to always suffer from "stage fright." It is said that Xianhan lives a lonely life in Shanghai. Every time there is a game, there is very little enthusiastic support from friends, which is especially the main reason for his stage fright. I really give him unlimited sympathy.

Wu Qixiang

His original energy is abundant, and his skills are superb, which is rare in Shanghai, but he often neglects his training due to his fondness for pleasure. Now that he has focused on training this year, he has restored his original appearance. His current state is obviously good, and he is a top-quality player.

Li Tiansheng

Can maintain his original state. Tiansheng is already old, so I don't dare to expect him to perform more. His current achievements are enough to be gratifying.

Song Lingsheng

Still lacks the peak state. Sometimes he seems weak, and Lingzai is also the general hub for the team to launch attacks and retreat to defend. Therefore, Lingzai should strive to be energetic so that he does not fail to live up to expectations.

Zheng Yingquan

Maintains his previous level, but it is difficult to see his special features for a while. This is what I see, I don't know if it is true?

Qu Yongfu

Can give people a better impression in all aspects, especially in terms of skills, but is lacking in a final strike. Unfortunately, A Fu's temper is difficult to achieve perfection, often affecting his performance. I sincerely hope that he can strive to change.

Li Yichen

The lazy ox is no longer lazy. He strives to do his best in every game. His skills are amazing. I hope he continues this spirit. He is indeed the only center forward in Shanghai, and is definitely not comparable to the likes of Robert Stoff or those who rely on skill, such as Jie Linjing.

Gao Baozheng

Is willing to put all his efforts into the battle and remains unwavering. This is Xiao Gao's most admirable advantage. He is still consistent in his style and adds a lot of color to the team.

Luo Shoufu

With the posture of a new player, he is very eager to show his head. However, due to lack of experience, it is not possible to have the most normal expectations. What needs to be paid attention to is being calm in the battle, not being discouraged or giving up. Then, in terms of his skills, he is worthy of being a top general in the inner front.

Fei Chunhua

Has rarely shown his face this year. Judging from his past skills, if he can restore his physical strength, his performance will not disappoint people.

Zhou Qilin

His situation is very good, with progress and no retreat, which is commendable. If he can continue in this situation, Qilin's left wing will be the focus of the League team's attack, and it will be easy to become a big name lacking such talent in Shanghai.

As for Xu Wenkui's physical condition being worrying, Cai Sheng's focused management, and Xiuqing's still needing to be nurtured, I will not talk too much. If the above eleven generals can accept my contributions, it is very possible for the League team to defeat the Portuguese merchants and Tung Wah again and win the championship of this league. I write this to encourage them!

### Athletes from Six Countries Will Compete for the Shanghai Boxing Throne, Scheduled for the 20th of this Month

In the West, boxing matches and ball games have the same powerful appeal, and perhaps the former's appeal has an even more surprising crowd-pulling function. As soon as the famous American boxer Joe Louis, nicknamed the Brown Bomber, announced his fight, the tickets were immediately bought out, creating an unprecedented record for buying airplane tickets around the world. In China, the situation is somewhat different, because boxing matches are not held regularly, which invisibly reduces the interest of the audience. In fact, boxing is more exciting, more exhilarating, and more tense than football in terms of excitement and appreciation!

Continue to Promote Boxing

The person in charge of boxing in this city was formerly the manager of the Jai Alai Stadium, Xin Shengduo. He was the only mainstay who loved and promoted this sport most vigorously. Later, he left China for the Philippines, and his younger brother took over the responsibility. In the middle, Russians and Chinese youth jointly promoted it, but they were in a dormant state due to a shortage of funds. This time, Xin Shengduo's younger brother has rekindled his ambition and gathered like-minded Chinese people to jointly promote this long-dormant boxing sport.

Boxing is the highest expression of strength. It is neither borrowed nor false. It relies entirely on the power of the fists to knock down or frustrate the opponent. At this moment in China, it is absolutely necessary to promote this sport. It can increase people's courage, strengthen the strength of the whole body, and indirectly establish great achievements in eugenics. Frail, cowardly, timid, and retreating; in the boxing world, they are "kicked out" and have no room for existence.

Athletes from Six Countries Scheduled to Fight

Boxing in this city has been silent for eight months. This time, the banner of competing for the Shanghai boxing throne is raised to arouse the attention of the masses who love sports in the city. The date is set for January 21 (Sunday) at 10:00 a.m. at the Jai Alai Stadium on Xianyang Road. The athletes from various countries participating in the battle have captured all the good players in Shanghai, including heroes from China, Germany, Italy, Russia, and Poland. The lineup can be said to be unprecedented in the past.

The last big fight for the championship will be contested by Polish athlete Tandi and German expat Sam Liu. Tandi once defeated the Japanese boxing champion Luotian by a small margin, igniting the flame of light in the Chinese boxing world. Liu Ke is a well-known tough guy who "fights to the death." He is willing to work hard and is full of the spirit of hard work. Everyone will definitely not relax in this battle. Chinese athlete Li Peigen is a young talent. In his past three battles, he failed in scores the first two times due to lack of experience. The third time, he moved forward bravely and coped with ease, which was very different from before. In the third round, he knocked the Westerner down to the ground with one punch, unable to move. It can be seen that his boxing skills are proficient and improve rapidly, adding glory to the people of the six countries. Dao Ci will compete with Russian expatriate Weiduo. He will definitely use his past courage and ruthlessness to achieve a new record of consecutive victories. There is also a young and famous player, Lin Zhongfu, who is skilled in his moves and fierce in his attacks. He has repeatedly defeated foreigners, washing away the insult of the Sick Man of East Asia. This time he will fight the Westerner Xiang Hai, hoping that he will use his "no victory, no rest" spirit.

### Essentials of Basketball Theory (10)

— Zhong Zhaoan

(XI) Each shot must be carefully considered and prudent, do not regard it as child's play, and throw it out casually, hoping to hit by chance.

(XII) Do not often get into the habit of rotating the ball when shooting. Whether or not the ball should be rotated when shooting depends on the distance, as well as the angle and direction. Generally, it is suitable for long distances, but not for close shots.

(XIII) Shooting should be familiar with various methods, especially the few that you have not used habitually. If you often use one shooting method, even a superb skill can easily be defended by others.

(XIV) Shooting should not be deliberately postured, or trickery to gain admiration and temporary pleasure. Reduce unnecessary movements as much as possible.

(D) Dribbling

Dribbling is only second to passing and shooting in importance in the entire basketball game. Watching players dribble in and out of the court, the cleverness of the moves can be admired endlessly. But dribbling requires correct technique and proper use to be effective. Otherwise, it will inevitably cause the entire team to lose opportunities and stagnate the offense. It is common to see many players who only focus on dribbling forward, but do not know how to quickly pass the ball. Comrades who have been waiting for a long time under the basket lose their good opportunities. Or when the offensive route in front is empty, with no one defending, they mistakenly shoot from a distance. And they do not know how to dribble forward and shoot when close to the basket, so that the ball is easily missed by the opponent. All of this is because they do not understand the use of dribbling. Therefore, it is not appropriate to use dribbling too much or too little. Moreover, excessive dribbling will inevitably lead to individual technical performanceism, affecting the harmony of the team's cooperation. In fact, dribbling should not be used often unless there is a suitable opportunity, especially it should not become a habit to dribble as soon as you get the ball. It is necessary to know that dribbling forward is far less fast than passing the ball. Now, the correct posture for dribbling and its uses, key points, and common sense will be briefly described below:

(I) The Correct Posture for Dribbling

When starting to dribble, first hit the ball on the ground and then start walking to avoid the disadvantage of walking with the ball. Use your fingers to spread out and push the ball on the ground, and wait for it to bounce back before continuing to dribble forward. The method of dribbling only needs to use the strength of the fingers and wrist, and never use the palm to pat the ball. Otherwise, it will not be flexible. Each dribble must allow the ball to be completely controlled by the fingers so that its speed, height, and direction can be adapted to the situation and used freely to pass through the offensive route. Unless there is no one blocking the front, the dribble should be low rather than high. But it cannot be too low, too low will not be easy to control, at most no lower than the knee, and no higher than the waist. The ball should be dribbled in front of the body, and the body should lean forward to protect the ball from moving forward. Both eyes should be focused on the court in front to find a passable route. When often passing through enemies, the officer should dribble lower and faster. If the road ahead is empty and no one is guarding, you can let go and run quickly. The ball should be dribbled slightly higher, especially when rushing straight to the basket to shoot.

(II) The Main Uses of Dribbling

There are many uses for dribbling. Now I will choose the more important ones and list them below:

(I) When it is inconvenient for yourself to shoot, and you cannot pass the ball to a teammate who is closely guarded by the opponent, you can dribble forward to obtain a more favorable position.

(II) As a way to jointly shoot the ball.

### Hua Lian Basketball Team Coach—Zhang Youxiang

—

The Hua Lian Pharmaceutical Factory Basketball Team is the leader of the Shanghai basketball league. The team won the third Chenyou Cup and the Xiqing Championship the year before last. In the final of the open league, they voluntarily gave up. Last year, they continued to win the Chenyou Cup championship and were tied for champion with Zhongbei in the Shenbao Cup. The team is average in talent, able to defend and attack, has superb skills, strictly observes discipline, and is loved by the audience. The team owes its excellent results today to coach Zhang Youxiang.

Mr. Zhang has been researching basketball for more than a day. In the past, when Father Lao was in charge of the Chinese basketball hall, he was already the main player of the Yaoguang team. Therefore, today, coaching Hua Lian, the results are remarkable. In addition to Hua Lian, the only Western basketball team in Shanghai, Menok, is also under his command. Mr. Zhang's leadership of the team has been outstanding, just like his management of the Hua Lian Pharmaceutical Factory. He is thirty-seven years old this year and is from Hangzhou. He graduated from the Department of Pharmacy of the Sino-French University and has a deep understanding of Ye Xue. In addition to serving as the director and general manager of Hua Lian Pharmaceutical Factory, he also serves as the director and general manager of Hua Lian Chemical Factory, and the director of Cathay Pharmacy Shanghai Utensils Company Epihi Candy Company. Director of the Pharmaceutical Masters Association and supervisor of the Pharmaceutical Industry Association. In terms of sports, he serves as the vice chairman of the Shanghai Basketball Association and is also a member of the Basketball Referees Association. His character is based on the word "truth." He likes to study, does not stick to conventions, seeks truth from facts, and is dedicated and consistent. Whether running a business or coaching a team, he does it with a consistent spirit, without being slack and succeeding in the end.

### Sports Tidbits

Ms. Zhang Jiaxuan, director of physical education at Shanghai Girls' Middle School, is scheduled to marry Mr. Zhou Zhixin, a basketball star at the Shanghai Bank, at the Bankers Association tomorrow (the 15th). With common interests and common ground, both will be able to get help in their careers in the future.

The Hua Lian Pharmaceutical Factory Basketball Team has the determination to go on a long march to Pingjin, but hopes that there will be no traffic problems at that time. Then this southern team's expedition to the north will begin with Hua Lian. It is also heard that Mr. Zhang Youxiang once talked with Mr. Xie Yiqin, hoping that if possible, the Green Team will also travel together at that time, and the harvest will definitely be greater.

Lu Guoxun, a basketball long-range shooting expert, has joined the Tung Wah Basketball Team, but Xiao Lu is busy on the Shanghai-Ningbo Road, selling tea, and it is a pity that he cannot fully devote himself to basketball.

Zhongbei team member Zhao Zhilin has always had good social skills and is now the general manager of the Far East Restaurant on Avenue Joffre. The restaurant has low prices and good quality, and people in the sports world may wish to try it out.

Tung Wah rookie Tao Tingfu recently graduated from the Youth Air Defense Headquarters. He was among the best and is now the instructor in various Baojia districts and is sure to give full play to what he has learned. (Jing Duan)
