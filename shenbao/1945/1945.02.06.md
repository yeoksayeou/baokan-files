### Fierce Fighting in the Manila Area: Japanese Army and Navy Intercept Enemy, Japanese Troops on Polillo Island Engage in Hand-to-Hand Combat

Central News Agency Dispatch from a Philippine Frontline Base, 5th: Enemy forces advancing southward from the San Fernando area gradually approached the northern outskirts of Manila by the 3rd. After subjecting the Manila area to intense shelling, a portion of the enemy forces broke into Manila city proper around 5:00 PM on the 3rd. Japanese troops are currently intercepting the invading enemy forces at Santo Tomas University, engaging in fierce combat.

Central News Agency Dispatch from a Philippine Frontline Base, 5th: The Japanese Manila defense forces immediately rose up to intercept the enemy's incursion into Manila, and are currently engaged in fierce combat centered around the vicinity of Santo Tomas University. The enemy has suffered heavy losses, but the power plant has been destroyed due to enemy shelling and bombing, so Manila has been plunged into darkness since the 3rd. Japanese and American forces are repeatedly engaging in fierce battles in the northern part of the city. The enemy is also gradually approaching the southern part of Manila with reinforcements from Batangas province by air and sea, but Japanese troops are preventing the enemy's northward advance at various locations and engaging them in fierce combat.

Central News Agency Dispatch from a Philippine Frontline Base, 5th: The Japanese Army and Navy are currently intercepting the enemy forces invading the Manila area, launching attacks everywhere and inflicting great damage on the enemy. In addition, the Japanese Special Naval Landing Forces intercepted enemy troops in the suburbs of Manila on the 3rd and launched a fierce counterattack, inflicting heavy damage on the enemy. It has now been determined that the Army and Navy forces have achieved the following results: killed or wounded over 1,600 enemy soldiers, destroyed and set ablaze 17 enemy tanks, over 26 transport vehicles, and over 24 artillery pieces.

Central News Agency Dispatch from a Philippine Base, 5th: In coordination with the battle for Luzon Island, the enemy has recently begun invading operations in the central and southern Philippines. On January 18th, the enemy landed 2,000 new soldiers with about a dozen vehicles on Polillo Island, the main island of the Sulu archipelago. The Japanese garrison on the southwest coast of the island carried out hand-to-hand combat attacks throughout the night, and on the 27th, the entire force, united as one, boldly charged into the enemy's ranks, inflicting heavy damage on the enemy. By the 27th, the garrison had killed approximately 300 enemy soldiers, destroyed one mountain gun, three amphibious tanks, and 21 encampments. In the central Philippines, the enemy is also attempting to cut off transportation between Leyte and Cebu Islands and is patrolling the coast of Cebu Island with torpedo boats.

Central News Agency Dispatch from Tokyo, 5th: On the Luzon Island front, Japanese troops are conducting a thorough defensive operation. Newspapers here today, the 5th, published the following report on the war situation: The American enemy is single-mindedly advancing on Manila and making exaggerated claims, saying that the Philippine war situation will be transformed by the capture of Manila. After being intercepted by Japanese troops, the enemy nevertheless forcibly invaded and advanced to the outskirts of Manila, claiming that the city has already been occupied. If they were to occupy Manila, they would surely broadcast propaganda claiming that the Philippine war is over. However, the Japanese army's goal is to make the American army bleed, and Manila has no military value. The Japanese army's objective is not land or cities, but to annihilate the enemy's forces. Therefore, even if Manila becomes a battlefield, the Philippine war, and even the Luzon Island war, will not end there, but will actually begin there.

### Mindanao Police Force Swears to Sacrifice Themselves for the Nation

Central News Agency Dispatch from Mindanao, 5th: As the decisive battle between Japan and the United States approaches, the Mindanao detachment of the Philippine police force is cooperating with the Japanese military to maintain public order and provide labor tirelessly. Recently, to express their sincere desire to die for their country, they signed a pledge in their own blood and submitted it to the Philippine Republic authorities, expressing their determination to sacrifice their lives to meet the national crisis. The gist of the pledge is as follows: The Philippines has declared war on the United States and Britain. Under the leadership of President Laurel, we are striving for the common goals of the nations of Greater East Asia. Receiving divine blessings, we hereby solemnly pledge loyalty, to engage in combat with the American forces, to faithfully fulfill our duties, and to sacrifice our lives if necessary.

### Japanese Cabinet Decides to Dissolve the Newspaper Association

Central News Agency Dispatch from Tokyo, 5th: At a Cabinet meeting on the 2nd, the Japanese government decided to dissolve the Japan Newspaper Association on March 1st. The dissolution order was issued on the 4th. The Japan Newspaper Association was established on February 5, 1942, and for three years, it has cooperated with the government's newspaper control efforts, upholding the government's intentions and promoting the public interest of newspapers. During this time, it contributed greatly to strengthening the newspaper system by reorganizing newspaper companies, eliminating the commercial aspects of newspapers, establishing a joint newspaper sales system, and implementing a newspaper reporter registration system, thus fulfilling its mission. In view of the increasingly serious situation, the government has decided to implement a more thorough and self-regulated responsibility system for each newly opened company, in order to promote free speech and closer unity between the government and the private sector, and to open up the difficult situation. In the future, the Speech Guidance Department will be directly managed by the Information Bureau. Regarding the allocation of newspaper paper and other materials, joint facilities, newspaper reporter registration, and newspaper distribution and sales, it is planned that the incorporated association Japan Newspaper Corporation (provisional name), which is scheduled to be established on March 1st, will be responsible for these matters. The organization of the Newspaper Corporation will be formally established after the dissolution of the Japan Newspaper Association. In addition, the resolutions of the Greater East Asia Newspaper Conference, held the year before last, will establish an office within the Newspaper Corporation.

### Memorial Service Held Yesterday for the Late Advisor Suga

Central News Agency Dispatch from Nanjing, 5th: Today, the 5th, was the fourth anniversary of the martyrdom of Lieutenant General Suga, the late military advisor to the National Government.

The ceremony concluded at a little after 11:00 AM.

### Roundtable Discussion on Ultra-High Altitude Warfare

Aerial warfare has progressed to ultra-high altitudes. Over Leyte, in the midst of fierce fighting, and over the mainland of Japan, where enemy planes come to bomb, air combat is all taking place at ultra-high altitudes, that is, at 6,000 to 8,000 meters, or 8,000 to 10,000 meters above sea level. At the same time, recent air combat is mostly taking place at altitudes too high for the human eye to see. As air combat has undergone such great changes, our brave Japanese pilots have also overcome drastic weather changes. At altitudes above 10,000 meters, the temperature reaches minus 55 degrees Celsius, causing the skin to crack and the leather gloves gripping the propellers to even ice over. The development of aircraft has infinitely demanded altitude and speed. The current aerial warfare is already being conducted at altitudes of 10,000 meters. As for stratospheric air combat, the era when the superiority of the aircraft determines victory or defeat must not be far off. The enemy American's boasted Flying Fortress B-29 aircraft, which bombed the Japanese mainland at ultra-high altitudes, were driven away with their tails between their legs, which proves the excellence of Japanese aircraft. However, we must not be complacent about this, because ultra-high altitude combat is a production battle. To meet the needs of the soldiers, the biggest task this year is to produce even more superior aircraft. What do the warriors who are tirelessly protecting the skies over Japan and fighting desperately with the B-29s demand of the production front? The Mainichi Shimbun convened a roundtable discussion on ultra-high altitude warfare at a certain air defense unit base in northern Kyushu to hear the experiences of battle-hardened warriors. At the same time, there were also powerful reports on the current state of aircraft production.

Major Yamamoto: The enemy American B-29 aircraft came flying at ultra-high altitudes, opening up a new battlefield of the lower stratosphere at around 10,000 meters, which has become a topic of concern for all Japanese citizens. This battlefield, which has never existed in previous war history, and the many mysterious realms within the realm of science, have all become the places where victories and defeats are decided in this great war. In order to win the victory in aerial warfare, it is naturally necessary to make the general public understand this mysterious high altitude, and at the same time, it is also necessary to overcome the many harsh conditions of high altitude and produce excellent aircraft. In order to enhance this national will, please feel free to talk about everyone's personal experience of fighting with B-29s at high altitudes.

Reporter: What exactly does ultra-high altitude refer to?

Captain Sasa: In the past, 6,600 feet was called ultra-high altitude, but it's different now, 8,000 meters or more is called ultra-high altitude. That is to say, it is 2,000 meters higher than before. These 2,000 meters are really extraordinary.

Major Yamamoto: There must be a big difference in the flight conditions at 6,000 meters and 8,000 meters!

Captain Sasa: The difference is huge. The change of these 2,000 meters is really beyond what ordinary people can imagine.

Major Yamamoto: That's equal to the height of two Mount Fujis. Perhaps less than a quarter of all Japanese people have been to the summit of Mount Fuji. For human beings without wings, that is truly an unimaginable mysterious realm.

Reporter: What is the difference in temperature?

Major Kobayashi: The altitude of 10,000 meters is minus 51 degrees Celsius, so the altitude of 8,000 meters is around minus 42 degrees.

Major Yamamoto: There is a difference of about 40 to 50 degrees.

Captain Itakura: At 7,000 meters above Burma, it is also 30 to 40 degrees, so at such a high altitude, there is not much difference between the tropics and the cold zone.

Captain Imai: The air currents are very clear and there is no dust obstructing the view. When you look out from the plane, it is really open and clear, and you only feel a little dim beside your seat. In short, the difference between light and dark is very obvious.

Major Yamamoto: It's very different from the degree of light and dark that people on the ground imagine.

Major Kobayashi: On a clear day, if you fly to an altitude of 6,000 meters, you can see Korea. As for Tsushima, it can be seen very clearly.

Major Kobayashi: On the ground, you can see mountains and the sea, but the viewing line is always limited. When you fly to such a high altitude, it is a vast and boundless sky, so searching for the enemy really feels like looking for a needle in a haystack. Ordinary people think that when a B-29 flies over, you can see it right away, but this is really the talk of a person from Qi Dong. Perhaps it is because you feel small in the vast sky.

Captain Sasa: Because there is no object, you completely lose the sense of perspective, like going back and forth in a fog. The so-called fog, when you drill into the fog in the sky, it sparkles and glows. It's completely like scattered silver sand.

Major Kobayashi: The so-called clouds are crystal bodies. Perhaps it would be more appropriate to call them smoke. When you look at them from below, they are completely clouds, but when you fly into them, you don't know if you are in the clouds, you just feel that your vision is suddenly poor. It is completely smoke, because it is ever-changing and difficult to grasp, which is why you really feel like you have fallen into a fog.

Lieutenant Kashide: When a person ascends to ultra-high altitude, he really feels lonely, so he often talks to himself.

Lieutenant Kashide: If there is a friendly plane, that would be really happy.

Major Kobayashi: At this time, if you try to fire a gun, the mood suddenly changes and you don't feel lonely.

Reporter: When you fly to high altitude, the temperature changes in an instant, so are you all wearing electric heating suits?

Major Kobayashi: We will use electric heating suits in the future, but we haven't used them yet. Everyone hasn't had any problems yet.

Reporter: Oh! So there are no convenient electric heating suits yet?

Major Kobayashi: Even if you wear an electric heating suit, your hands and feet are still cold. Holding the propeller, you feel that the outside of your gloves is frozen, but the inside is very hot, which is really a strange feeling. Although I wear an oxygen mask, my eyelashes are frozen and my eyes feel sluggish.

Captain Sasa: Sometimes I suddenly feel like something is covering my eyes and I can't see. It turns out that my eyelashes are covered with ice. (Translated by An from the Mainichi Shimbun, January 3rd)

Editorial

### Self-Restraint of Hedonists

In general, people believe that Shanghai is the only pleasure zone in China, where all kinds of hedonistic activities are available. Therefore, the mentality of those who live in Shanghai is also one of hedonism. The formation of this mentality is the result of decades of chronic anaesthesia by British and American imperialism within the concessions. In the past, with the concessions, everything was allowed. One could be shielded for all criminal acts, one need not worry about national affairs, one need not worry about social matters. Even when war approached beyond the concessions, one could simply stay within the concessions, lie in bed and listen to the sound of gunfire, unaffected, and still enjoy life to the full. Therefore, they only cared about selfishness and profit, in order to seize the capital for enjoyment. Even now, although there are no more concessions, a large number of people still hold the view that nothing else matters except enjoying life to the full.

Leaving aside the past, the Greater East Asia War has been going on for more than three years. Which metropolis in the world (including the enemy's), such as Tokyo, Berlin, Paris, Moscow, London, Washington, is more comfortable than Shanghai? Which is better able to satisfy hedonism than Shanghai? Yet the mentality of some people in Shanghai is still dissatisfied with the current state of affairs. And in reality, they are still enjoying themselves as much as possible and trying to gain exorbitant profits as much as possible. In their minds, they never think about the problems of tomorrow, perhaps there are no signs of the problems of tomorrow at all. As the saying goes, "Drink today, worry about tomorrow later". Therefore, wartime life has never been spontaneously practiced in Shanghai.

However, in reality, those who are able to enjoy themselves are still the small number of people who have succeeded in corruption and profiteering. How many of these people think about the hardships of life for the majority? How many think about the crises of the future? And how many think about defence and preparedness measures? Therefore, we have repeatedly insisted on resolutely eliminating profiteering and corruption, because profiteering and corruption are the capital for enjoyment, and enjoyment is a drug that anaesthetizes people's minds. These past few days, the skyrocketing prices of gold and public bonds are again the work of these profiteers. Why doesn't the authorities stop them? At the same time, we further hope that the authorities will force citizens to practice wartime life. In this increasingly tense decisive battle situation, hedonistic lifestyles that are enough to anaesthetize people's minds, and hedonistic lifestyles that consume material resources, absolutely need to be banned. First, awaken the spirit of self-restraint, automatically reduce living expenses, and no longer pursue exorbitant profits. Then, implement an equal and average wartime life and ban all extravagant consumption that exceeds wartime living needs.

Regarding the point of self-restraint, we express our admiration for the fact that the city's police officers have been able to automatically revitalize themselves in the shortest possible time. For example, in the past, the police in the urban and suburban areas often extorted passersby carrying goods. According to general estimates, the losses suffered by citizens in this area amounted to 450 million yuan per month. Since the appointment of Mayor Zhou and Secretary-General Luo, this has gradually been eliminated. This spirit of self-restraint on the part of the police is admirable. On the one hand, we hope that the authorities will quickly and effectively reorganize tax collection and improve the treatment of police officers. On the other hand, the citizens, in order to show their encouragement for this spirit of self-restraint, should also express their gratitude.

In short, we cannot but closely monitor the latent crises in Shanghai, and we cannot but properly plan ways to eliminate them. In the passive aspect, we must eliminate exorbitant profits and force the practice of wartime life. In the active aspect, establishing security in the suburbs and the city, and preparing temporary relief work, are all essential measures.

During the banquet, Minister Chu first delivered a welcoming speech, followed by Ambassador Li's reply. After the speeches, they toasted with champagne, wishing the nations prosperity. The guests and hosts enjoyed themselves until about 9:00 PM when the banquet ended.

Foreign Minister Chu's Welcoming Speech

Nanjing, 5th (Central News Agency) - Foreign Minister Chu Minyi delivered a welcoming speech at the banquet held on the evening of the 5th to welcome Li Shaogeng, the newly appointed Manchukuo Ambassador to China. The original text is as follows: "Your Excellency Ambassador Li, today is the day of the arrival of the second Manchukuo Ambassador to China, Your Excellency Li, to assume his new post in our country. I have prepared a simple banquet to express our welcome. I am extremely honored that Your Excellency Ambassador and all of you Excellencies have graced us with your presence in your busy schedules."

"Since the publication of the joint declaration of China, Japan, and Manchukuo on November 30th of the 29th year of the Republic (1940), our two countries have exchanged envoys and restored diplomatic relations. It has been more than four years since then. In order to implement the spirit of the tripartite declaration, our late Chairman Wang personally visited your country on March 8th of the 31st year of the Republic (1942), and was received with great courtesy by His Majesty the Emperor of your country. Prime Minister Zhang was also dispatched as a special envoy to return the courtesy to our country. Envoys have traveled back and forth incessantly, and the relationship between the two countries has become even closer. After the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, both countries have exerted their full strength to assist in the completion of the war. The Greater East Asia Joint Declaration was also issued the year before last. This declaration is, in fact, an expansion of the spirit of our tripartite declaration into a joint declaration of all countries and nations in East Asia. It is also an additional layer of close relations between our two countries on top of the tripartite declaration. Therefore, our late Chairman Wang once declared to us that China and Manchukuo are compatriots, are now compatriots, and will continue to be compatriots in the future. These words, though short, are full of deep meaning and are thought-provoking. They are completely consistent with the idea that Manchukuo and Japan are of one heart and mind and cannot be separated."

"Now that the Greater East Asia War is becoming increasingly fierce and has entered the decisive stage, our two countries should continue to uphold the spirit of cooperation in the past and bravely advance towards the same goal of cooperating in the war so that the final victory can be achieved as soon as possible. I will make the greatest effort to encourage this wish together with Your Excellency Ambassador."

"When Your Excellency Ambassador previously served as Ambassador to Japan, I also happened to be serving as Ambassador to Japan. We had many opportunities to meet in Tokyo. I have great admiration for Your Excellency Ambassador's morality, knowledge, and outstanding experience. Later, I was transferred back to China and resumed my position as Foreign Minister, and Your Excellency Ambassador also soon left Japan and returned to your country to assume the position of Foreign Minister. These kinds of transfers are truly worthy of commemoration and mutual joy in the diplomacy of both countries. Former Ambassador Lü served in our country for nearly four years and has made great contributions to promoting friendship and cultural exchange between the two countries. I deeply express my regret at his imminent and glorious return to his country, and I hope that he will take good care of himself for the sake of the nation."

"Now that Your Excellency Ambassador has been dispatched to our country, it is truly gratifying to meet an old friend again. We will work together in the future and will not reduce our efforts compared to the past. Our government will also provide all assistance to Your Excellency Ambassador in the performance of your duties. Now, I raise my glass to wish His Majesty the Emperor of your country good health, the prosperity of your country, and the health of Your Excellency Ambassador and all of you Excellencies."

### Location of the Roosevelt-Churchill-Stalin Conference

A City on the Black Sea Coast

The dispatch also stated that it has been learned that the conference is being held in a city on the Black Sea coast, but some important negotiations will be held on warships. The number of attendants accompanying the three is greater than the previous Tehran Conference, from which it may be said that all three intend to resolve at least the major issues. London hinted that the British Prime Minister brought many financial experts, presumably to discuss post-war financial issues. The conference also seems to be discussing the publication of a declaration to the German people.

### Situation Before the Opening of the International Trade Union Congress

Discord Between Britain and the United States

Bern, 5th (Central News Agency) - German News Agency reports, Exchange Telegraph Company comments on the tension before the opening of the World Trade Union Congress, saying that discord has already occurred between the British and American trade unions. Robert, the representative of the American Federation of Labor, gave a speech at the general meeting of the International Trade Union Congress, announcing that his union will not participate in organizations joined by Soviet trade unions, because he believes that Soviet trade unions are not free, but only a part of the Communist Party apparatus. Robert's words aroused considerable commotion among European socialists. Therefore, British miners' leader Lord Wright recently criticized the Americans for coming to Europe and attempting to forcibly change the International Trade Union Congress into the American view. The American Federation of Labor also said that if the Soviet Union participates, they will threaten to withdraw, which is a clear political intimidation. The Trade Union Congress of Industrial Organizations, which is pro-Bolshevik, and the Soviet Trade Union both have representatives participating in the World Trade Union Congress, so those two organizations will inevitably be able to control the congress. Serious disputes may occur again before the opening of the Congress next Tuesday.

### American Aircraft Lost Twenty-Four Planes in Raid on Berlin

It is truly a terror bombing.

### Soviet Submarine Activity in the Baltic Sea

Stockholm, Sweden, 5th (Central News Agency) - German News Agency reports, according to news from local newspapers: Soviet submarine units have repeatedly intercepted Swedish ships sailing to Germany. All of these ships were carrying gifts for prisoners of war in Germany and Axis countries. The above news was transmitted by a certain Swedish naval officer.

### British Industries Association Sends Representatives to Chongqing

Stockholm, Sweden, 5th (Central News Agency) - After the United States realized its creeping control over China's economy, Britain, which possesses significant rights and interests in China among the major powers, has recently seemed to be urgently seeking countermeasures. According to Reuters London dispatch, the British Federation of Industries, in order to assist China's industrial associations, established the British Chongqing Development Association several years ago. This time, it has decided to dispatch two members to Chongqing. The delegation is composed of technician Froggatt and Labor Party member Ustic. It is scheduled to depart from Britain this month and arrive in Chongqing at the end of the month. The purpose of this trip is to establish close relations with Chongqing and develop trade between various organizations of the British and Chongqing Industrial Associations. According to Ustic, industrial organizations in Chongqing have received considerable assistance from the British Federation of Industries in the past. Britain is the birthplace of the industrial movement and has abundant experience, so it will provide greater assistance to Chongqing.

### Major German-Soviet Tank Battle Near Frankfurt; Berlin Rushes to Build Defensive Fortifications

Berlin, 5th (Central News Agency) - The Soviet-Kov army's offensive has been slow in the past day, but the fighting remains fierce. In Gondo-Skye, six kilometers east of the Frankfurt front, German and Soviet forces are engaged in a major tank battle, with Soviet shells falling directly on the streets of Frankfurt. As for the battles in the Warta and Warthe river bends, on the 4th, Soviet forces again entered Gippengen southeast of Frankfurt. In addition, the vanguard of the Soviet-Kov army north of the Warthe River has already broken into Bielick, forty-two kilometers from Zehden. The Pomeranian front is currently in an extremely urgent state.

Stockholm, Sweden, 5th (Central News Agency) - Reuter's news agency reports, Exchange Telegraph Company dispatch from Moscow: Soviet military correspondent Gavrilov said that the German defenses on the east bank of the Warta River are stronger than any other defenses the Germans have in the East, and fierce fighting is still ongoing, because there are many strong fortresses such as Küstrin and Frankfurt.

Berlin, 5th (Central News Agency) - In view of the Soviet army's daily approach to the Warta River, the German authorities have now begun to strengthen fortifications. The Berlin National Socialist Party, under the guidance of Goebbels, has ordered all men in the city between the ages of fifteen and sixty who are unable to take up arms to engage in the construction of fortifications to defend Berlin. Thousands of citizens are using shovels and other tools to construct tank traps and all kinds of obstacles.

### Strengthening Air Defense Preparations to Prevent Indiscriminate Enemy Bombing

As the war situation becomes more urgent, enemy air raids are bound to become more frequent. On the day the U.S. Air Force completely destroys them, there will naturally be no need to worry, but today we must temporarily endure enemy air raids. Allied land, sea, and air forces are intensifying their efforts to overthrow enemy air force bases, destroy their equipment, and cut off their transportation. However, it is very difficult to ensure that not a single enemy plane enters the skies over Shanghai and other major cities, and it is also expected that the U.S. Air Force will indiscriminately bomb in the future. We must be adequately vigilant.

Many residents of Shanghai believe, "The U.S. Air Force will absolutely not bomb Chinese residential areas. Bombing will mainly target Japanese military facilities and areas densely populated by Japanese, such as Hongkou, so there is no need to worry." It is unknown how this erroneous view arose, but in any case, it is foolish nonsense. Have not the U.S. planes' air raids so far been a blind bombardment of places without any Japanese military facilities? As a result, haven't many innocent civilians lost their lives, property, and homes for nothing? The randomness of enemy bombing can be understood by looking at the examples of Yuezhou, Changsha, Pukou, and Hankou, especially in Shanghai, where there are even more obvious examples. The British and Americans originally held racial discrimination against the Chinese. The British and Americans still harbor blatant contempt for Japan, an allied nation with equal or greater combat power than them, so what good impression do they have of China and the Chinese people? This is very obvious. In short, they always treat the Chinese as slaves. If they distribute benefits, they will take measures against colonies as in the past, as if they were livestock they keep, to be slaughtered at will. Know that the true enemies of the Orient are Britain and America. The invasions of the past by Britain and the exploitation by America are something the Chinese should reflect upon and carefully consider.

Enemy air raids also have a political effect. For example, they send one or two planes to invade Shanghai, carry out bombing, and kill civilians, hoping to increase the Chinese people's antipathy towards Japan. To put it plainly, they want to make the public think, "It's being bombed because the Japanese are here," and also create a fear of air raids among the public, in order to alienate China and Japan. In addition, of course, it also contains the propaganda effect that no matter how strict the air defense is, the strength of the U.S. Air Force is sufficient to break through it.

In this situation, what preparations do we have for air raids? Apart from a portion of organizations tasked with air defense, the general public has no preparations for air raids. How many people wearing air raid uniforms can you see on the streets of Shanghai? As for air raid shelters, they are not ready, shelters have not been clearly designated, and water for fire prevention is even more out of the question. In addition, there is almost no preparation for the emergency treatment of those who are unfortunately injured and for orderly evacuation.

In such a situation, if enemy planes carry out indiscriminate bombing, not only will houses collapse and family property be lost, but individual lives cannot be guaranteed. To avoid this disaster, what should individuals do? I hope everyone, like our ally Japan, is constantly wary of enemy air raids, taking care at all times and preparing at all times. As for practical preparations, there are the following items:

(1) Wear air raid clothing: Chinese clothing is completely unsuitable for activities in emergencies and must be improved for agile movement. It is best to wear air raid clothing all day, for both men and women. Clothing that conforms to old customs and habits but is not suitable for the current situation should be quickly improved at this time to cope with air raids.

(2) Prepare air raid shelters: To protect precious lives when bombed, the best thing to do is to hide in an air raid shelter. Hiding in an air raid shelter, especially one with overhead cover, is much safer, and there are many examples of lives being saved as a result. Conversely, there are also many people who are killed by blast winds or crushed by collapsing houses because they do not flee into air raid shelters during air raids. Therefore, in peacetime, you should prepare an air raid shelter that you can entrust your own and your family's fate to.

(3) Fire prevention preparation: It is absolutely necessary to quickly extinguish lights during an air raid. Furthermore, you must prepare water and sand for extinguishing fires, as well as various other fire prevention preparations.

(4) Emergency treatment: To treat those who are unfortunately injured during an air raid, the treatment methods, first aid training, and subsequent handling must be fully studied and practiced on weekdays to prepare for emergencies.

In addition, to protect family property, it should be evacuated immediately. Under the enemy planes' blind bombing, the furniture, bedding, valuables, etc. that have been painstakingly prepared can be turned to ashes in one fell swoop. Moreover, it is not easy to replace a piece of furniture after it is lost today. If things are evacuated in advance, then even if a part is lost during an air raid, a part can still be preserved, so as not to end up with nothing. Of course, no place can be guaranteed to be safe when enemy planes indiscriminately bomb, but you must try your best to avoid letting yourself fall into a state of utter poverty.

When implementing the evacuation of "things," you should also think about the evacuation of "people." In densely populated cities, the elderly, young, men, and women who are enough to hinder activities in an emergency should be sent to the safer suburbs in advance to evacuate, so as not to become victims of indiscriminate enemy bombing.

The above explanation is simple, but it is all the measures that should be taken and the preparations that must be made under air raids. At present, most people are indifferent to air raids and unprepared, which is a great danger of inviting the greatest misfortune. The British and Americans will never protect the Chinese; they want to suppress, bomb, and kill us! Those who are still leisurely and unhurried when enemy planes are plotting to indiscriminately bomb are those who do not want life and property. We must trust the military power of our allies, but at the same time, we must prevent the enemy Americans from carrying out indiscriminate and cruel killings from the sky. This is really the greatest task that the country requires us to undertake. (Husband)

### Municipal Economic Bureau Informs Merchants and Residents to Cooperatively Suppress and Stabilize Prices, Do Not Illegally Raise Prices by Taking Advantage of the End of the Year

Director Xu of the Municipal Economic Bureau, upon assuming office, immediately resolved to continue in-depth research on the problem of suppressing and stabilizing prices and to establish concrete and severe measures. Now, during this period of the Lunar New Year, to prevent merchants from taking the opportunity to raise prices, in addition to informing merchants and residents to abide by the laws and regulations on suppressing and stabilizing prices, he specially convened a discussion meeting with responsible persons of various industry associations, informing and urging member merchants to cooperate with the government to stabilize the people's livelihood policy and not to engage in illegal acts of raising market prices on their own. The general idea of the notice is as follows: "This bureau is the economic administrative center of the city. We have been actively organizing and implementing the various important policies of visiting festivals and people's food, suppressing and stabilizing prices, and managing materials, so as to ensure that the national economy and the people's livelihood are protected. However, how to facilitate transportation, smooth the source, crack down on hoarding, and match supply and demand is not only within the Bureau's planning, but also depends on the efforts and assistance of the citizens to promote perfection and achieve expected results. Now that the Lunar New Year is approaching, the citizens are accustomed to purchasing New Year's goods, and the buying and selling transactions in the commercial market are also the busiest at this time. At this time, we should share the difficulties together and not take advantage of the end of the year to raise prices, disrupt the market, and violate the government's intention to balance prices. It is hoped so."

Hope the Authorities Will Enforce Price Limits

The general price level in this city once fell due to the Municipal Government's adjustment of institutions and Mayor Zhou's declaration of his determination to suppress the rise in prices. However, recently, with the approach of the Lunar New Year, the general price level has gradually risen again, especially the prices of vegetables, fresh meat, and northern and southern goods, which have risen even more sharply, affecting the daily life of citizens deeply and significantly. The general public hopes that the price evaluation authorities will promptly assess general prices, strictly enforce them, and stabilize the people's livelihood.

### Seventh-Period Household Coal Briquettes on Sale Starting Today, Materials Allocation Office Explains Reasons for Price Increase

Household coal briquettes in the old 1st and 8th districts of this city will be distributed from the 6th to the 19th of this month (sales will be suspended from the 13th to the 16th for the Spring Festival holiday). Each person can purchase five catties with a voucher, at a price of 175 yuan, which is a considerable increase compared to the previous distribution price. In order to understand the reasons for the price increase, the reporter specially consulted the person in charge of the Materials Allocation Office, who said that the increase in the price of household coal briquettes this period is purely due to the excessive cost of raw material sources and transportation. The relevant authorities have repeatedly discussed and carefully decided. The quality and composition of the coal briquettes after the price increase meet the standards, and they do contain 50% coal dust. It has been verified several times that there are no errors, and all retail outlets are strictly prohibited from mixing and exchanging them. In addition to ordering the samples to be placed in bottles and displayed in conspicuous places for comparison, citizens are requested to pay attention to whether the coal briquettes they purchase are consistent with the samples when purchasing with vouchers. If any mixing or exchange is found, they can immediately report to the allocation office for investigation, and it has been earnestly announced and made known.

### Mayor Zhou's Political and Personal Health is not Good

Mayor Zhou Fohai of this city has been suffering from a cold since taking office due to the heavy burden of handling government affairs. After medical treatment, the fever has subsided, but it has not completely cleared. Following the doctor's instructions, he must rest, so he will not receive any visiting guests.

### Population Statistics for the Urban Area of This City

According to the Central News Agency reporter's inquiry with the authorities of the Household Registration Office of the Police Bureau of this city, the population statistics for the urban area of this city for December of last year, excluding the newly merged district's population, which is being re-examined and has not yet been included, are as follows: Huangpu District: 107,745 people; Laozha District: 142,420 people; Xincheng District: 333,547 people; Jing'an District: 78,692 people; Jiangmi District: 135,785 people; Putuo District: 112,172 people; Taishan District: 287,291 people; Lujiiawan District: 211,576 people; Changshu District: 173,600 people; Huashan District: 207,437 people; and Changning District: 168,596 people.

### Regulations for Calculating Postage Odd Numbers

The postal authorities have announced in Notification No. 142 that the implementation of a 150% increase in postage fees will be implemented from January 20th of this year. It is now stipulated that for postage fees obtained based on the aforementioned percentage increase, if there are odd numbers of less than one yuan, the method of rounding up to a number will be as follows: those below two jiao will not be calculated, those from two jiao to five jiao will be changed to five jiao, and those above six jiao will be changed to one yuan. Therefore, the following fees should be paid according to the new regulations. The public is requested to pay attention. (Attached table)

(Newspapers) First-Class (Local) First Category (per 100 cubic centimeters) 1.5 yuan, Second Category (per 100 cubic centimeters) (charged at 60%)

(Newspapers) Second, Fourth-Class (Out-of-Town) - (Japan, Korea, Kwantung Leased Territory, Taiwan, Hong Kong) First Category (per 50 cubic centimeters) 1.5 yuan, Second Category (per 50 cubic centimeters) (charged at 60%) 1.5 yuan.

### The Dark Side of the Wharf is Still Heavy, the Scalpers are Exceptionally Active

Since the incident, this city has been in an unprecedented deformed state due to the fact that social, political, and economic aspects have not been fully straightened out. Such as black market ticket sales at the station, the "black hats" and "red hats" falsely claiming authority, the "scalpers" filling the docks and rampant, extortion, and the public extortion of police officers along the way, is obvious, known to women and children, laughing at home and abroad, and cannot be denied. Since Mayor Zhou took office, his prestige has spread, and villains have retreated. The police officers' long-standing habits have gradually been kept to themselves due to the authorities' strict management and improved treatment, and the order at the station has also improved due to strict supervision. In order to understand the general situation of the wharf at present, the Central News Agency reporter went to the Bund area for an inspection yesterday (5th) morning. Now, the observations obtained will be reported to the people concerned. The reporter arrived at Pier 12 at more than 11:00 yesterday morning. At that time, the ticket office of the China Shipping Company was selling tickets to Xingang at the window. Passengers lined up to buy tickets, and the order seemed to be good, but the "scalpers" were still exceptionally active. These guys seemed to be in contact with the company's staff, soliciting passengers and buying black market tickets. The gang members openly stood at the front of the line of purchasing passengers, stirring up the purchase of tickets and asking for very high prices, so that those who abided by the order waited for several hours and still failed to obtain them. They could only sigh helplessly. The police officers on duty there not only did not come forward to maintain order and stop the activities of villains, but also turned a blind eye. The company's employees were also busy entering and exiting the ticket office, soliciting bribes and purchasing on their behalf. Tickets with a face value of 1,300 yuan were raised to 1,600 or even more than 2,000 yuan. Such dereliction of duty is particularly noteworthy. It is hoped that the competent authorities will quickly take strict measures to eliminate long-standing malpractices and benefit merchants and travelers.

### Police Bureau Abolishes the Title of Specialist

The Shanghai Special City Police Bureau implemented institutional adjustments and personnel reorganization on February 1st to increase work efficiency. It is learned that Director Zhou, who is also the director of the bureau, issued a hand decree yesterday (5th), ordering the dismissal of Gao Guanchen, Qian Borun, Ding Zhengyan, Xiang Rang, Xing Naiyong, Ma Ping, Li Zhenhuan, Zhao Xuantang, Tang Jian, Shao Jingfan, Yang Xian, Lan Yisu, Wang Guishan, Shen Xiongfei, and Xu Fengshu, 15 specialists without actual work, and waiting for other appointments.

### Municipal Public Works Bureau Bureau Affairs Meeting

The Municipal Public Works Bureau held its first bureau affairs meeting at 3:00 p.m. yesterday (5th). The chief secretary of the bureau, the section chiefs of various sections, and technicians were present. First, Director Xu elaborated on the purpose of the meeting and discussed in detail the various work plans that the bureau should promote and reform in the future. Then, each material provided opinions, and it ended at about 5:00 p.m. It is learned that the bureau has decided on the outline of various work plans to be implemented in the next six months and will implement them step by step in the coming days.

### Rickshaw and Pedicab Operators Arbitrarily Raise Fares

Recently, as the Municipal Public Works Bureau reduced the number of tram services for both rickshaws and pedicabs, and transportation was scarce, operators arbitrarily raised fares. This caused an invisible increase in transportation costs for the general public. After investigation by the bureau, it was discovered that rickshaw and pedicab companies, taking advantage of the change in municipal government and the Public Works Bureau's internal restructuring, illegally and arbitrarily increased fares. It is reported that the previously approved daily rental for a rickshaw was 400 yuan, but it was increased to 800 yuan. The approved daily rental for a pedicab was 1,500 yuan, but it was raised to 3,000 yuan. Under this upper-level exploitation, pedicab and rickshaw pullers then arbitrarily raised their prices. The bureau is now conducting a thorough investigation and will severely punish any illegal businesses once evidence is found.

### Monthly Sales of Stamps in Shanghai Reaches Ten Million Yuan

The person in charge of the Jiangsu Stamp Tobacco and Alcohol Tax Bureau stated that since the Ministry of Finance announced the implementation of the revised Stamp Tax Law for Emergency Periods on July 15th of last year, the bureau has actively promoted it. With the supervision of the Tax Affairs Administration and the conscientious investigation of the investigation department, major factories, companies, and stores in Shanghai are generally able to understand that stamps are an important national tax. All ledgers, receipts, and invoices are mostly affixed with stamps. However, many smaller shops often use count slips instead of invoices, deliberately avoiding affixing stamps. It is reported that the bureau is working to correct this. As a result, monthly sales have reached as much as seven or eight million yuan, which is incomparable to the previous monthly sales of only four or five hundred thousand yuan. If continuous improvement can be made in the future, the sales figures should be even more impressive.

### Municipal Education Bureau Announces School Calendar for the Current Semester

The Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau, in accordance with the Ministry of Education's order and the revised regulations on school year, semester, and holiday dates, drafted the school calendar for primary and secondary schools for the 33rd year last autumn. This was submitted to the Municipal Government and then to the Ministry of Education for approval and record. It is now learned that the bureau will issue this school calendar to all schools for compliance. The school calendar for the next semester is as follows: February 1st is the beginning of the second semester of the 33rd year.

### After Seeing "Narcissus"

— Shu Jun

The play "Narcissus" was written by Mr. Gu Zhongyi. It was performed at the Tian Gong Theater a few years ago and ran for dozens of days. It can be said to have been a great success. This time, it is being performed to raise funds for the home for the elderly, with the cooperation of artists such as Shi Hui, Tang Ruoqing, and Er Da, adding to its splendor. The rumors of using public service as a pretext are actually a great misunderstanding.

Narcissus is currently in season and is a must-have for every household. Although this flower is not as evergreen as pine and cypress, it blooms in the dead of winter and grows in the deep mountains and secluded valleys. It combines the purity and transcendence of plum and orchid with the solitary appreciation of chrysanthemums, giving people a sense of detachment. The play "Narcissus" also possesses this style, showing people the summons of justice and is indeed a drama worth seeing.

The entire play grasps the core well and is performed with tension. In the first two acts, set in the Tao family's living room, Ouyang Yingxian (played by Tang Ruoqing)'s innocence is quite pure and does not lose the style of a new woman. Tao Xiannan (played by Shi Hui)'s sad and brooding demeanor fully reveals his inner pain, and his expression is very profound, arousing the audience's sympathy. Wei Mali (played by Du Ping) only has money and power in her eyes and does not understand the true meaning of love. Her and her group of friends, who only seek material enjoyment, can be used as a critique of today's society. Sun Qiying's portrayal of the lawyer Mei is treacherous and cunning, and his expression is also quite thorough. In the third and fourth acts, set in Yingxian's cousin Jin Guangqing's home, Jin Guangqing (played by Chen Yulin) is a preacher, but he is rigid and inflexible. His inhumanity is performed vividly, causing the audience to laugh out loud. His lover, Miss Jiang (played by Li Li), also performs lively and exquisitely, and is petite and cute. In the final act, the dialogue and expression of Tao Xiannan after becoming impoverished, blind, and losing an arm are particularly profound and moving, similar to Qiu Haitang who is critically ill after being wounded. Shi Hui's performance can be described as thorough. Tang Ruoqing also achieves amazing results in this play.

It is said that this play is only being performed at the Lihua Theater for three days, and the run is short. Lovers of spoken drama, do not miss it.

Revering Longevity and Benefiting the World, Admirable Enthusiasm

Jin, the owner of Zhui Yuan Hall, celebrated his 50th birthday. Receiving generous gifts from relatives and friends, he originally intended to hold a banquet to express his gratitude. To save resources, he used 1 million yuan from the banquet funds to donate 100,000 yuan each to this newspaper's aid to education fund, the News Daily's student loan fund, the Ningbo Association in Shanghai's education fund, the Shanghai Epidemic Hospital, and the Shanghai You You Nursery. He also donated 500,000 yuan to the Siming Hospital. All of the funds have been distributed. The owner cherishes all, is eager to educate, reveres longevity and benefits the world, which is truly admirable. We record these facts to set an example. Are there any benevolent gentlemen who will follow suit?

St. John's Orchestra Wedding Services

The St. John's University student-organized Fan Wang Du Orchestra is now providing services for wedding celebrations to increase the total amount of the charity bazaar. All proceeds will be donated to the charity bazaar to rescue students out of school. The band is purely composed of St. John's University students who have studied music extensively and have been taught by various professors, so their performance is quite excellent. It is worth a try for people from all walks of life. On the one hand, you can have a novel wedding, and on the other hand, you can help students out of school. Isn't that killing two birds with one stone? We hope that all sectors will support and participate in this good cause. Contact at 83 Chongde Road (telephone 86507), deadline end of February.

### The Highly Notable "School Owners" Income Problem

— Shen Li'er

Since the municipal education authorities announced the tuition fee increase standards on the 9th of last month, and considering the sudden sharp rise in general prices and the difficulties faced by various private primary and secondary schools, the fee standards were adjusted to double. Regarding this, one cannot but say that the education authorities have made great efforts to maintain the education sector under the current environment. However, in reality, there are indeed some private primary and secondary schools that adhere to the adjusted fee standards, but most private primary and secondary schools still collect fees according to their own standards, and their amounts often exceed the fee standards announced by the education bureau by several times. Leaving aside how the education bureau should deal with this problem to maintain the dignity of the law, it is highly concerning that "school owners," at a time when credit is extremely tight, are taking advantage of the opportunity to collect tuition fees to obtain huge amounts of cash. They may then use this as "hot money" to enter the speculative market, manipulate materials, cause prices to rise again, and reap huge profits. It seems that in order to suppress prices and stabilize people's livelihoods, this deserves great attention.

According to the current tuition fees collected by general private primary and secondary schools, the average for primary schools is 15,000 yuan, and for secondary schools, it is 24,000 yuan. Taking the average for both primary and secondary schools as 20,000 yuan per person, then a private school principal with 300 primary and secondary school students will suddenly obtain 6 million yuan in cash within these few days. As for larger schools with student populations of over 2,000 (although schools with 2,000 students are not common, there are still four or five of them), the cash obtained would be over 40 million yuan. Even if those with reduced or free fees account for 20%, their income would still be no less than 30 million yuan. Although there are some who adopt flexible "installment payment methods" to take into account the difficulties of students' parents, these are ultimately a small minority. In essence, if this 30 million yuan in cash is used to enter the speculative and hoarding market, it will undoubtedly affect prices, which is an inevitable trend. In that case, the burden on people's lives will be further exacerbated, on top of the overlapping exploitation by profiteering merchants, by the "school owners" using hot money to seek profit, which is tantamount to "adding fuel to the fire" and "adding frost to snow." Even if we take a step back and say that the "school owners" may not be good at business or dare to personally enter the commercial battlefield, many will lend money at high interest rates to make profits. Recently, the "black market" overnight interest rate has reached 30%, and 30 million yuan in cash can be used to obtain 9 million yuan through the exploitative method of "deducting interest in advance." This 9 million yuan in heavy interest will then be multiplied and placed on the heavy burdens of ordinary people's lives through the hands of profiteers. Therefore, the "school owners" cannot but be suspected of indirectly contributing to the soaring prices. Faced with this issue, from the standpoint of suppressing prices and stabilizing people's livelihoods, we propose the following points:

(1) Since the "school owners" have formed speculators similar to banks and money shops, the government authorities should supervise the "hot money activities" of the "school owners" in the same way that they supervise banks and money shops to prevent them from using their assets for speculation, according to the laws and regulations for ensuring people's livelihoods during wartime. When necessary, grant the "Financial Inspection Office" special powers to inspect the "economic actions" of the "school owners."

(2) All school teachers and staff should request that six months of salaries be paid at once, so that the hot money is "divided into smaller portions," so that the "school owners" cannot carry out large-scale speculation. Otherwise, teachers and staff should diligently monitor the "economic actions" of their principals and demand that their interest income from tuition fees be disclosed for public judgment.

(3) The education authorities should actively conduct audits of the income and expenditure accounts of various private schools, and the focus of their audits should not be on whether the distribution of salaries to teachers and staff meets the 75% ratio stipulated by the ministry, but should focus on the principals' use of high-interest lending methods to obtain huge profits.

(4) The public opinion sector should actively expose "school owners" who engage in speculation with tuition fee income, and persuade them with righteousness from a moral standpoint. Today's students' parents, unwilling to sit idly by and watch their children lose their education, often endure exploitation from high-interest loans to obtain tuition fees. If these funds are used to fuel soaring prices, it will indirectly increase the burden on students' parents again.

The above four points may not be entirely comprehensive, but in order to prevent the "school owners" from not devoting their efforts to their primary work and competing to profit from the price issue after the "red opening" of the lunar new year, we feel compelled to speak out. This issue affects not only the education sector, which is the foundation of the nation, but has also stepped out of the school gates and entered the broader lives of all Shanghai citizens. The seriousness of the situation is no longer just a matter of the lives of students, teachers and staff.

### A Double Loss

— Jian Han

The once-heated issue of tuition fees has gradually subsided with the successive opening of schools at all levels. However, the impact of high tuition fees is gradually unfolding in society. Among them, the most obvious are the following two major problems:

First, the number of students in various schools has decreased significantly. Some have seen an 80% attendance rate, some 70% or 60%, and some even less than half. Where did these old students go? Apart from a small portion returning to their hometowns, most of them have dropped out of school! They were denied access to school because they could not afford the tuition fees. In the eyes of the "school owners," they should not have the right to education.

Second, a large number of teachers in various schools have also become unemployed. Business in ordinary stores is slow, and expenses are difficult to cover. The only solution is to lay off employees. Large and small "school shops" are no exception. For example, Xicheng Elementary School in this city dismissed six teachers at the same time. Regardless of their past achievements or teaching performance, the only reason is that the number of students has decreased and the number of classes has been reduced. Imagine, under the current situation of rising living costs, where can they find a way to survive once they lose their jobs? Riding the same boat and sharing weal and woe simply does not exist in the minds of the "school owners."

Increasing tuition fees, causing students to drop out of school and teachers to become unemployed, is truly a double loss! However, the "school owners" suffer no losses at all. At this time when students dropping out of school and unemployed teachers are left with nothing to do but laugh and cry, they can take a large amount of cash and use it as funds for their freelance and company businesses!

Increasing tuition fees benefits the principals, harms the teachers, and burdens the students! (Contributions to help unemployed teachers)

### Field Yellow Stone Inkstone and "Pullover呢" Charity Sale for Benevolent Purposes

(1) Mr. Qian Peirong wrote: "Respectfully, I have witnessed the increasing number of bodies of soldiers and civilians lying on the road, and the countless hidden poor who are hungry, cold, and without food or clothing. I have also seen the urgent appeals from your organization and the Xinwenbao newspaper for assistance with education loans, as well as the generous donations from people in society. I am ashamed of my meager financial resources and unable to provide much assistance. Fortunately, I have a field yellow ancient inkstone at home, measuring four and a half inches in length, three and a half inches in width, and half an inch in thickness. It is bright and flawless, and rarely matched. I am now willing to part with it and donate the proceeds of the charity sale of 300,000 yuan to aid education and charity. I am now transferring this inkstone to your organization for receipt. I hope you will promote it widely. I believe there are many great philanthropists in Shanghai who will come forward to assist. Please donate it in the name of that philanthropist. I respectfully present my humble intentions and hope for your consideration."

(2) Chong Qiao Ni Rong Company wrote to this office: "Respectfully, your organization hosts various charitable endeavors, helping the poor and rescuing the distressed. I have always admired this and often thought of donating funds to help our compatriots in need, but circumstances have not allowed it, which I have always felt sorry for. Seeing the rising prices and the countless hidden poor who are without support, how can I bear to turn a blind eye? I am now offering an English-made ADC 'Pullover 呢' set for charity sale. At the current market value, wholesale prices among traders are at least 70,000 to 80,000 yuan per yard. If sold to customers, it would certainly be more than this amount. Assuming it is sold for 300,000 yuan, please use 100,000 yuan as small loan funds, 100,000 yuan as assistance funds for poor women giving birth, and 100,000 yuan as medical assistance funds for elementary school teachers, as a small contribution to relief. I respectfully present my humble intentions and hope for your consideration."

### Alumni Entertainment Association Actively Promotes

The University Alumni Advancement Association's entertainment event, which aims to raise funds for education and poverty alleviation for this newspaper, is currently actively being prepared.

At that time, the Yisheng Theater Troupe and movie stars will be invited to perform as guest performers, and the program will be very exciting. In order to increase efficiency, a general meeting of all directors was held yesterday (the 4th), and as a result, it was decided to organize a fundraising performance committee, with Xu Jingjiang elected as the director, Wu Chuanzao as the general affairs, Li Jianwen as the management, and Chen Wenfu as the ticketing. It was also decided to publish an "Advancement" journal on the 15th of this month to elicit the support of people in society and encourage fundraising among alumni. The content will all be based on the premise of helping education and alleviating poverty.

### Health Association Adds X-Ray Examination Hours

Recently, due to electricity restrictions in this city, lung disease examinations have been difficult. In view of this, the China Health Association has specially added the hours for tuberculosis prevention X-ray examinations to 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM and 2:00 PM to 5:00 PM, with examinations available on a walk-in basis, in order to improve service and promote early diagnosis. It is hoped that all sectors of society will not miss this opportunity for examination (Address: Meiqi Building, No. 996 Jing'an Temple Road).

### Returning Unaccepted Money to Rescue the Poor

Xiao Guangdong wrote to this office: "I, under the name of Xiao Guangdong, have a beef noodle stall located east of the Asian Hotel on Six Shanghai Road. On the 31st of last month, a customer left behind a leather wallet containing 7,000 yuan in cash and a business card of Zheng Yaquan. I picked it up at the time and do not know who it belongs to, so I have kept it for collection. Unexpectedly, the next day, Mr. Zheng came back to order. After talking, I realized that it was the person I was looking for. He showed his citizen's card, and it was correct. Therefore, I returned the wallet to him. Mr. Zheng was also generous. Overjoyed at the return of his property, he insisted on giving me 2,000 yuan as a reward. I refused, but he would not take it back. How could I accept it peacefully? Therefore, I dare to send the full amount to your organization and donate 1,000 yuan each to your small loan fund and your elderly care home, to create blessings for Mr. Zheng."

### Doing Good Brings Blessings

The Anlao Hospital and Tushanwan Orphanage wrote: "Respectfully, our hospitals have been experiencing financial difficulties and have repeatedly received appeals on our behalf through your newspaper. We have received assistance from numerous philanthropists, and we are deeply grateful for their generous support. Recently, we received 200,000 yuan from the Shanghai Catholic Charity Association, which was raised by Mr. Xue Zuheng and transferred by Mr. Tang Shuming from his daughter's engagement gifts, with 100,000 yuan for the Anlao Hospital and 100,000 yuan for the Tushanwan Orphanage. After receiving it, all staff members of the two hospitals, in addition to praying for blessings for the great philanthropist Mr. Tang and his relatives and friends, would like to take this opportunity to express our gratitude and promote kindness.
