### Gathering a Hundred Million National Strength to Prepare for the Homeland Defense War: The Japanese Government Clarifies its Belief in Certain Victory

Tokyo, 26th (Central News Agency) – The ground battles on Okinawa Island, although the Japanese army, navy, air force, and civilians were united, fought bravely, and planned well, have come to an end. As the enemy's invasion of the homeland becomes increasingly urgent, the Japanese government, in order to clarify its determination and call for the awakening of a hundred million citizens, decided at the regular cabinet meeting on the 26th to announce a Cabinet Edict. The Prime Minister then went to the Imperial Palace at 2 PM to seek His Majesty the Emperor's approval, and the Information Bureau announced it at 4:30 PM.

In the Edict, the Prime Minister earnestly expounded the unwavering determination to "strictly abide by the sacred instructions shown in the declaration of war, and exert all our strength to drive the enemy out of our land," which is supplemented by the Japanese military's operational policy of strengthening combat power and reorganizing national organizations, firmly believing in the inevitable victory of the homeland decisive battle. Finally, he called on the hundred million citizens to embody the Japanese spirit of treating life and death as one, and to concentrate all actions on combat power. This Cabinet Edict can be said to be a general mobilization of a hundred million citizens for the homeland decisive battle, and is worthy of attention.

Contents of the Cabinet Edict

The defense of Okinawa Island, although relying on the brave battles of the Imperial Army, Navy, and Air Force as one, and the unyielding cooperation and courageous struggles of officials and civilians, ultimately proved futile, which is a matter of deep regret. However, the significant damage inflicted on the enemy by the Japanese military's desperate fight will not only restrain the enemy's operational efforts but also inflict great mental blows, which will be beneficial to the future conduct of the Japanese military. Moreover, the enemy's air raids will become more intense in the future, and preparations must be made for the invasion of the Japanese homeland. This is a national crisis since the Mongol invasions, a critical moment for the survival of the Empire. The divine land is under the protection of His Majesty's spirit, and we must jointly protect it as land that should be eternally inherited by our descendants, and should never be invaded by foreign barbarians, let alone be trampled by the enemy. Therefore, we must strictly abide by the sacred instructions, uphold righteousness and serve the public, rely on each other in government and society, and help each other as neighbors, valuing morality and emphasizing restraint. Each should diligently perform their sacred duties, further enhance morale, and exert the overall strength of the nation to drive the enemy out of our land. The government's operational policy has been determined, and measures to strengthen combat power are being promoted daily. Furthermore, the National Volunteer Corps has been formed, and the national ranks have been renewed. The government, in accordance with repeated statements from the past, is determined to advance resolutely. At this critical juncture for the survival of the Empire, this minister further shows the people the great declaration of war, hoping that each will embody the spirit of treating life and death as one, encourage and motivate themselves, rely on each other, overcome increasingly serious difficulties, and concentrate all actions on winning the war, vowing to overcome these difficulties.

### Casual Chats from the Veranda

The Significance of Song Weng's Appointment as President and Vice President of the Executive Yuan

Question: In your previous remarks, you did not involve the relationship between the Central Government and Song Ziwen's appraisal faction. What are the views of the Communist Party of China (CPC) regarding Song Ziwen's appointment as President and Vice President of the Executive Yuan? Furthermore, what is the historical significance of this change in the Chongqing regime?

Answer: The CPC believes that the Chongqing regime is a united political designation of the landlord class and big financial capitalists. The Central Government and the Central Army combine these two classes. Economically, the Chongqing regime relies entirely on land rent collected by the landlord class, foreign debts borrowed by big financial capitalists, and the profits from monopolized imports. Furthermore, the Central Government's expenses rely on the "flexible" methods of big financial capitalists, while the local governments' expenses largely rely on land rent income. At the same time, since the army's expenses are supplied by the income of the local government, the army naturally has a close and inseparable relationship with the landlord class. In order to centralize the army, the Central Government implemented a system of directly allocating land rent to the national treasury, thereby changing the system of maintaining the army's supplies. However, in reality, it has not produced effective results. Therefore, as long as the Chongqing regime is largely controlled by the warlord cabinet, it is absolutely difficult to rectify the old-style local administration in the hands of the landlord class. Since the landlord class monopolizes local administration with the qualifications of land rent collection, it is naturally impossible to expect the emergence of a modern and enlightened central government. Only when the local officials appointed by the Central Government and the local autonomous organizations jointly handle local administration can the foundation of the Central Government be consolidated and China's economic development be guaranteed. China's big financial capitalists also hope to move in this direction. At the same time, the Soviet Union and the CPC will not oppose the Chongqing regime moving in this direction in order to eliminate the feudal forces of the landlord class. Stalin once said the following about the future of the Chinese revolution at the Central Executive Committee of the Russian Communist Party in 1927:

"...In March 1926, Chiang Kai-shek's purge of the Communist Party in the Kuomintang was the first major attempt by the national bourgeoisie to control the revolution. The Central Committee of the Russian Communist Party had already advocated that "the policy of the Communist Party remaining in the Kuomintang must be strictly observed" (April 1926), which is well known. This is a policy: to further develop the revolution and closely cooperate with the Communist Party members, to establish the unity of the Kuomintang by exposing and isolating the left wing, and to make the right wing obey the discipline of the Kuomintang. As long as the right wing obeys the discipline of the Kuomintang, it should be utilized, and their organizations and experience should be utilized. If the right wing violates the discipline and betrays the interests of the revolution, they should be expelled from the Kuomintang."

Needless to say, although the situation is different now, the "anti-communist trinity" is equivalent to the Kuomintang right wing mentioned here. It can be said that the CPC is faithfully implementing this policy by "closely cooperating with the left wing inside the Kuomintang and the Kuomintang government" to expose and isolate the "anti-communist trinity." On the other hand, the United States also does not approve of the Kuomintang right wing's blatant anti-communist policy. Therefore, the rise of the Kuomintang left wing to the political stage and the subsequent abolition of Chiang Kai-shek's dictatorship are welcomed by the Soviet Union and the United States. Regardless of whether Chiang Kai-shek himself is happy or not, as long as the general trend is towards this direction, he will naturally have to change direction. Therefore, Song Ziwen's appointment as President and Vice President of the Executive Yuan is due to the unanimous demands of all parties.

Chiang Kai-shek's Position

Question: Then why didn't Chiang Kai-shek move in this direction earlier?

Answer: I believe Chiang Kai-shek's position is as follows:

1. What he hopes for day and night is the unification of China. As a rare practical politician in the world, he knows very well that the Chongqing regime is a combination of ruling classes with no organization and extreme disorganization. He knows that the internal personnel infighting within the Kuomintang is so complex that it prevents the Chongqing regime from implementing revolutionary policies. He also knows that there is no guiding theory within the Kuomintang that is sufficient to overcome such divergent opinions and mutual opposition. Of course, in form, there is the theory of the Three People's Principles, which is recognized by everyone, but in essence, apart from nationalism, there are as many different opinions on the interpretation of "people's livelihood" and "people's rights" as there are Kuomintang members. Leading such a party that is a heap of loose sand, he is always racking his brains and painstakingly pursuing a balance of internal forces. Therefore, he cannot implement revolutionary reforms to the national policy unless the surrounding objective environment is absolutely necessary, that is, unless it reaches the so-called "final moment," in other words, unless the majority of the ruling class deems it necessary.

2. At the same time, Chiang Kai-shek also knows that the CPC always uses this kind of policy reform to expand its power, so he is very afraid of this result. Revolution is inherently insatiable. After one reform is completed, another reform is demanded, and as a result, they are reformed one by one. Therefore, historical conservatives always try their best to preserve the existing system. Chiang Kai-shek is no exception, and he takes the same attitude towards domestic reforms.

3. Precisely because he is a conservative, he is also a nationalist. He discovered the bond of national unity in the family system that has been passed down in China for generations. Before discovering a new national unity element to replace this bond, he is unwilling to easily abandon morality. Since maintaining China's old morality is the landlord class, Chiang Kai-shek is particularly unwilling to see the decline and demise of the landlord class. Because he knows that China's financial capitalists have the comprador nature of American financial capitalists, and the more China's financial capitalists are oppressed by foreign financial capitalists, the more they must rely on the landlord class for the domestic rural economy; therefore, from an economic point of view, he also believes that the landlord class is the backbone of the country. Therefore, he thinks that in order for China's backward industry to develop, even if it is a fairly harsh exploitation of farmers, it is a rare thing in the process of national development.

4. Finally, he believes that no matter how the current world situation changes, unifying China is the most necessary thing. There are two solar systems in the current international diplomacy. One is the solar system centered on the United States with the United Kingdom and South American countries as satellites; the other is the solar system centered on the Soviet Union with the Balkan countries, the Baltic coast countries, and Poland as satellites. Both solar systems are using strong attraction to try to attract several countries that have not yet joined any solar system to their side. If a comprehensive peace cannot be realized between Chongqing and Japan, then Chongqing itself can only resist these two kinds of attraction by relying on a strong and powerful national unity. If China continues to maintain its current attitude, it is likely to be divided by the attraction of the two solar systems. For this reason, Chiang Kai-shek wants to complete the unification of China as desperately as possible. Therefore, the CPC is very afraid of being "unified" by Chiang Kai-shek, so it is taking an increasingly hostile attitude towards the Kuomintang. As a result, the friction between the Kuomintang and the CPC is becoming more and more intense. Mao Zedong severely criticized Chiang Kai-shek at the Seventh National Congress of the CPC for not using the weapons imported from the United States for the general counter-offensive against Japan, but for preparing for a future anti-communist civil war. Naturally, this criticism is consistent with the facts. However, Chiang Kai-shek did not intend to use all the weapons to oppose the Communist Party of China. He believed that if China had a modernized and armed army of three million, it could proudly stand between the United States and the Soviet Union and maintain the independence he wanted.

The above-mentioned Chiang Kai-shek's position has a great influence on the movements of the Soviet Union. From the Soviet Union's point of view, the struggle between Japan and the United States is of course an imperialist war to compete for the Chinese market. However, in relation to China, the Soviet Union considers the Japanese-American war of aggression, so Stalin once declared that Japan is an aggressor country. The Chongqing side immediately echoed this with great fanfare, exaggerating the propaganda, saying that Stalin's statement was a prelude to the Soviet Union's participation in the Pacific War, and said that as long as the United States started mainland operations, the Soviet Union would immediately send troops to Manchuria. However, judging from the current tendency of the Chongqing regime, we can determine that if the Soviet Union sends troops now to armedly stop the Greater East Asia War, Chongqing will use this opportunity to launch an anti-communist civil war, using American power to disarm the CPC. Under such circumstances, as long as the Soviet Union does not sit idly by and ignore the CPC, the Chinese civil war is bound to develop into a second Spanish civil war. Therefore, before the emergence of forces within the Chongqing regime that can harmonize the relationship between Chongqing and the United States with the improvement of the relationship between Yan'an and the Soviet Union, the Soviet Union will avoid participating in the war. This situation is developing within the Chongqing regime, and after the various factors that have caused the Soviet Union to avoid participating in the war are eliminated, the Soviet Union's right to speak on the Pacific issue will not necessarily be lost suddenly. Judging from the current situation of Chongqing and the Soviet Union, it can at least be said that the factors hindering the Soviet Union's participation in the war are still flourishing, and the Soviet Union will never rashly participate in the war.

Editorial

### Removing Obstacles to Political Reform

At the present juncture, it is urgently necessary to reform politics in order to strengthen political power and complete the Greater East Asia War. However, we have been calling for political reform for quite some time, but in reality, in some respects, it still needs comprehensive and thorough reform. The main reason for this is that there are still many obstacles in front of the demand for political reform. These obstacles may not be clear on the surface, like a small reef on the ocean surface, or like a few rusty screws on the railway track. If the drivers of ships and trains are careless, they will cause a disaster. Because a small reef is actually a large mountain at the bottom of the sea, and the rust of a few screws is actually a reflection of the neglect of road maintenance work. Standing in the position of public opinion, we cannot but shout loudly to the drivers at any time not to ignore these reefs and the decay of some parts of the organization on the road of political reform! Cannot condone!

Let's take an example: this time, the storm of the soaring black market of bill discounting, which has been raging in the city, seems to be an accidental phenomenon in the economic field on the surface. However, the dark tide of discounting has actually been lurking for a long time, but in the past, everyone was indifferent, and it seemed that everything was safe. However, it has already stimulated the greed of a few illegal financiers, so this time, they took the opportunity to artificially create a phenomenon of cash shortage, excessively issued credit currency, and at the same time transferred a large amount of cash to seize the illegal income of high-rate discounting from the general public, resulting in further chaos in the social economy. What political reform can be talked about if the authorities can still seize and exploit at will? What can be talked about strengthening political power?

Of course, the example we have cited is just one of the reefs. There are countless reefs of this kind that exist in front of the road to political reform!

Let's take another example. How many people's lives have been affected by the food frenzy this time? Everyone can imagine it. The price of rice, which was less than 100,000 yuan per stone, once rose to almost 1 million yuan in less than a month. Now, although the price of rice has fallen due to the government's emergency measures, it can be considered to have stabilized. However, in fact, it is definitely not affordable for the salaried class. The wise government authorities are of course very concerned about and trying to rescue the threat to the lives of the vast majority of people. However, have they checked the crux of the dangerous situation that has caused today's situation? Have they found out which screws or rails are rusty? We have repeatedly provided the authorities and requested a thorough inspection, which should not be condoned. The authorities seem to have checked it, so they took this special emergency measure this time. However, we have also pointed out that emergency measures alone are not enough, and a second step must be implemented.

The examples cited here are about the decay of screws. Of course, there are still many such decays that exist in directly hindering the future of political reform.

Not ignoring reality, not condoning facts, avoiding reefs, replacing rusty screws, the ships and trains that move forward on the road of "political reform" will arrive safely at their destination. Today, when we are facing difficulties and shuddering, we must once again appeal to the wise drivers: do not ignore reality! Do not condone the facts!

### Summer Household Water Usage: Supply Will Not Be Reduced; Water and Electricity Company Hopes Users Conserve Consumption

As the summer season arrives, the climate is becoming increasingly hot, and residents' water consumption will inevitably increase. There have been rumors that the China Water and Electricity Company will restrict summer water consumption. A Central News Agency reporter visited the company's authorities yesterday to inquire. According to them: The company has considered that users' water consumption varies in different seasons each year. Therefore, the company has specifically stipulated the consumption volume for each season each year. The supply volume is 100% in spring (March, April, and May), 118% in summer (June, July, and August), 107% in autumn (September, October, and November), and 88% in winter (December, January, and February). Therefore, the company will not reduce the supply of water to household users in summer. It is found that the company produces water by cleaning and purifying the polluted Huangpu River water for supply to users. The procedure not only requires a large amount of electricity but also a large amount of clean water materials. Electricity and clean water materials are particularly important for enhancing combat power. Water consumption will inevitably increase in the summer. The company asks consumers to make every effort to reduce and save unnecessary water consumption, and hopes for assistance from all sectors.

### Stop Issuing Transfer Drafts: Eliminate the Evil Practice of Discounting; The Entire Financial and Price System Can Also Be Stabilized

Regarding the issue of banning the discounting of transfer drafts, the Central Reserve Bank convened a joint meeting of the banking and money industries on the 20th of this month. It was decided that from July 3rd, all banks and money shops would cease issuing transfer drafts drawn on the Central Reserve Bank, the Reserve Fund, and the money house. In addition to cash, banks and money shops may issue crossed immediate bank drafts to customers for payment. According to relevant authorities, the cessation of issuing transfer drafts this time can immediately eliminate the malignant expansion of bill credit. Not only can the practice of discounting be eradicated, but the entire financial and price system can also be stabilized. The Financial Affairs Inspection Department of the Central Reserve Bank has recently inspected the business of various financial institutions over the past week, examining the account books of customer deposits and cash on hand. It was found that not only were there actual instances of discounting transfer drafts, but there were even empty transfer drafts issued exceeding twenty times the deposit reserve. These empty transfer drafts flow into the speculative market, buying stocks and hoarding other commodities related to people's livelihood, manipulating market prices to rise wildly. This is purely caused by this kind of bad and illegal behavior. In recent years, newly established financial institutions account for about 80% of the total. Therefore, the entire financial situation in Shanghai is seriously affected. Therefore, stopping the issuance of transfer drafts immediately eliminates the speculative craze. For the adjustment of cash, supply and withdrawal will be based on the standard of deposit reserve funds paid by various financial institutions. Customers of each bank and money shop can also withdraw cash based on the standard of deposit amount, which will show fairness.

He was suddenly encountered by armed thugs impersonating public officials, who threatened him with a gun under the pretext of inspection, and forcibly robbed him of 350,000 yuan in cash, which they handed over to another accomplice and fled without a trace. Then they threatened Xu Bin-da, demanding that he take his bicycle to the Lujiawan Branch for investigation, attempting to escape in the meantime. Xu Dao-chu refused to give up. When they reached the intersection of Taishan Road and Wukang Road, Xu reported to the police officer on duty. The police officer tried to arrest them, but the robbers refused to be arrested and fired their guns. The police officer fired back and blew his whistle. Police officers nearby rushed to encircle and arrest them. The robbers fired their guns again and fled towards Wanping Road. Then they jumped on an eastbound tram. Seeing the police officers chasing them, they jumped off the tram again at the Gaolan Road intersection and fled north. When they reached the intersection of Taishan Road and South Dihua Road, they fired another shot at police officer No. 4985 on duty. The police officer fired back but missed. The robbers continued to flee towards Dongping Road. At this time, detective Liu Fu-lai of the Fourth Squad arrived at the scene on foot and immediately borrowed a bicycle to chase after them. The robber ran to the intersection of Dongping Road and Yueyang Road and aimed his gun at the detective. Fortunately, the bullet jammed and failed to fire. The detective ducked to avoid the shot, jumped off the bicycle, ran forward, grabbed the robber's wrist, and kicked him down, seizing the pistol. At this time, police officer No. 4985 helped arrest the robber and quickly took him and the weapon to the branch. The branch director, Yu, handed the case over to the Third Squad for investigation and ordered all police officers to search for the escaped accomplice, so as not to let anyone escape. It was also heard that a passing woman was injured by a stray bullet when the robber was arrested and has been sent to the hospital for treatment.

### Various Women and Children's Charities Implement Mandatory Evacuation: Evacuation Meeting Calls Responsible Parties for Discussions Yesterday

In order to implement the resolution of the second joint meeting of various groups of the Population Evacuation Committee of this city, the committee is implementing mandatory evacuation of various charitable organizations, selecting women and children's groups among them for priority evacuation, and is currently actively proceeding.

More than a dozen representatives from various women and children's charities attended. Mr. Huang Jingzhai (represented by Hu Yimeng), director of the Sea and Land Transportation Committee of the Population Evacuation Committee, presided over the meeting.

Two Purposes of Mandatory Evacuation

The chairman first explained the purpose of the mandatory evacuation of charitable organizations, stating, "The purpose of this mandatory evacuation of charitable organizations is twofold: first, to reduce the consumption of food caused by the prolonged stay of charitable organizations in Shanghai, and second, to avoid the danger of air raids in urban areas for women and children. The destination of this evacuation is the fertile Xishan Island in Dongting Lake. Our Xishan office has already arranged accommodation, so there will be absolutely no problem with the living conditions of the women and children. This committee is absolutely responsible. We hope that the charities will no longer wait and see, and will quickly submit the current number of people in the charitable organizations, as well as the overview of income and expenditure, to the committee so that we can start immediately." Subsequently, representatives of the various charities exchanged opinions on issues such as food supply after the evacuation, and agreed to submit the list of women and children remaining in Shanghai to the committee for consultation within a few days. The meeting adjourned at noon.

Measures for Evacuating People from Afar

The committee also convened a discussion meeting with various Shanghai-based native place associations from Nanjing and northern China at 2:00 PM to assist in the evacuation of people from afar. Representatives from the Hebei, Xuzhou, Jianghuai, Xiang-E-Gan-Xun and other Shanghai-based native place associations attended. Committee member Zong Jingze of the Land Transportation Committee represented Director Huang Jingzhai as chairman. The chairman first delivered a speech, stating, "The Land Transportation Committee has dispatched personnel to negotiate with the China Central Railway Company to arrange transportation for the evacuation of people from Nanjing and northern China. Once a certain number of people have gathered from the three provinces of Jiangsu, Anhui, and Zhejiang, the company will fully assist, and if necessary, add special train cars. The committee will dispatch personnel to escort the evacuees along the way. The fare and luggage will be handled according to the regulations of China Central Railway. As for the economic assistance for those who are poor and unable to afford it, the native place associations will find ways to help. In short, this committee is absolutely responsible for the evacuated people. There are three points that can be clarified: The fare will be according to regulations, and there will be absolutely no corruption. The committee will dispatch personnel to take care of the group evacuation along the way to avoid the trouble of military card inspections. Issuance of certificates to prove that they are good citizens evacuating from Shanghai to return to their hometowns, and rapid registration of their household registration. The evacuation work has now reached the implementation stage. The committee urgently needs the exact number of people returning to their hometowns in order to prepare vehicles and tickets. We hope that the representatives attending today will proceed as soon as possible." Subsequently, Yan Cirong, the representative of the Hebei Native Place Association, expressed his opinion on the currency system issue for the evacuees and requested assistance if there are any difficulties. The person in charge of the committee promised to provide a certificate to the Municipal Government to ensure the convenience of the evacuees on their journey. The meeting adjourned at about 3:00 PM.

Saving Breakfast to Donate to Charity School Funds

Reader Lin Zongzheng wrote, "I feel that there are many young people who are eager to learn. Learning is the only spiritual food for them. Their love for learning is so urgent! For the sake of the future masters and for the sake of moral assistance, we have an unshirkable duty to do our bit. However, as a wage earner with a very low income, I can only go hungry for a few days for breakfast. Therefore, I am willing to donate the money I save in three days (800 yuan per day, totaling 2,400 yuan) to your newspaper's "charity school fund." By chance, some young people who had to work because they lost the opportunity to study saw this and expressed great sympathy. They volunteered to donate 1,600 yuan to make it a round number. Finally, I earnestly hope that everyone in the world will fulfill their human obligations, contribute their strength if they have strength, and contribute their money if they have money, to this most meaningful cause!"
