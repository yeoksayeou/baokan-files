### Japanese Naval Escort Units Sink Six Enemy Submarines; British Aircraft Carriers Damaged During Raid on Sakishima Islands

Naval Base, 9th (Central News Agency dispatch) – U.S. forces have recently been making every effort to blockade Japanese ports and destroy maritime transportation by using B-29 aircraft to lay mines in key areas of the mainland. At the same time, numerous submarines are appearing in the southern regions and the seas off China. In order to ensure the security of transportation routes, the Japanese naval escort units have been attacking enemy submarines daily. From the beginning of June to the present, approximately one month, they have confirmed the sinking of six enemy submarines in the waters near the mainland. Air and sea forces continue to search for enemy submarines.

Tokyo, 9th (Central News Agency dispatch) – One hundred and fifty enemy P-51 aircraft attacked airfields in the Kanto region at 0:30 PM on the 8th. Japanese forces shot down four and destroyed eleven.

### Learning from the Lessons of the Okinawa Campaign, the Enemy Strives to Avoid Landing Operations on the Mainland; the Enemy Carefully Prepares for the Next Phase of the War

Tokyo, 9th (Central News Agency dispatch) – The enemy’s tactical failures in the Okinawa campaign were serious and significant, and the enemy military authorities have honestly acknowledged this. Since the turning point in the Okinawa campaign, the enemy has continued to prepare for the next phase of the war, and their preparations are being carried out with exceptional caution. This is evident from the enemy's aerial attacks on the Japanese mainland and the movements of the enemy air force.

Aerial Attacks on the Japanese Mainland

Having learned from the lessons of the Okinawa campaign, the enemy is striving to avoid direct landing operations on the mainland. Instead, they intend to first isolate the Japanese mainland and turn it into scorched earth before engaging in a decisive battle. This involves establishing close communication between the air forces based in the Mariana Islands, Iwo Jima, and Okinawa, and then undertaking the following offensive: Thoroughly bombarding Japanese mainland air bases to eliminate the power of special attack aircraft; Attacking Japanese small and medium-sized cities to completely destroy production facilities and eliminate the national will to fight; Dropping mines and closely guarding important transportation routes to cut off maritime transportation; Severing land communication to cut off contact between the mainland and the continent and the southern regions, strengthening the blockade of Japan, and destroying the mainland's war-making capability. The current state of enemy aerial attacks on the mainland shows that the enemy wants to achieve the greatest effect with the least sacrifice. This cautious approach demonstrates the enemy's determination to avoid repeating the mistakes of the Okinawa campaign. The movements of the enemy air force indicate that the enemy has established bases encircling Japan in the Philippines, the Mariana Islands, Iwo Jima, and Okinawa. Iwo Jima currently has approximately 250 P-51 aircraft, the Mariana Islands have approximately 900 to 1,000 B-29 aircraft, Okinawa has approximately 900 large, medium, and small aircraft combined, and the Philippines has a total of 2,800 aircraft in the 5th and 13th Air Forces. They are also attempting to strengthen their forces and mobilize as much of their main force as possible in various locations in order to win the decisive battle on the mainland.

Recent Movements of the Enemy Air Force

The recent movements of the enemy air force are as follows: The N29 58th Bombardment Squadron from the Indian base is being combined with the B-29s from the Mariana Islands base for operations against Japan; The 8th Air Force, led by Doolittle, is being transferred to the Pacific theater to participate in operations; The U.S. Army has newly established a Strategic Bombardment Force in the Pacific, commanded by Spaatz, placing Doolittle's 8th Air Force and LeMay's 20th Air Force under its command; A U.S. military tactical command headquarters has been newly established in Chongqing, commanded by Wedemeyer. In summary, these points indicate that before landing operations on the mainland, the enemy intends to launch a base-advancing operation. At the same time, it is also clear that the tactical failures in the Okinawa campaign have had a significant impact on the next phase of the war.

### Japanese Military and Civilians Fight Resolutely in Balikpapan City

Southern Front Base, 9th (Central News Agency dispatch) – Since the enemy landed in Balikpapan, they have been using heavy tanks as a vanguard to attack the Japanese army's positions. However, they have been blocked by the strong defensive positions of the Japanese garrison and have suffered heavy losses everywhere. Since the enemy began naval bombardment on the 15th of last month, a certain Chinese member of the Japanese military with an important mission left Balikpapan. Recently, he returned to a certain base and spoke about the valiant fighting of the Japanese garrison as follows: I departed from Balikpapan on the day after the first enemy naval bombardment (June 16th). At that time, the Japanese army immediately began to fight back. Even the general Japanese and puppet forces, under military command, performed their duties, showing great morale. There are countless examples of military achievements. Moreover, from the village head downwards, the indigenous people cooperated in building numerous defensive positions. Therefore, after the fierce enemy landed, they suffered such heavy losses. When I departed from the area, the commander said that they would resolutely defend the area to the death. The local Japanese residents, indigenous people, and the military formed a united entity, bravely fighting with self-supplied weapons and ammunition. Even though the enemy has a force of 10,000 to 20,000, they are not to be feared.

### Japanese Government Establishes New Military Supply Factories; Minister Toyota Encourages New Factory Employees

Tokyo, 9th (Central News Agency dispatch) – In order to strengthen the increased production of aircraft, Japanese military supply factories have been working together as one since April of this year, striving to produce. There is no need to discuss this. They are also actively carrying out the protection and dispersal of factories, the establishment of underground factories, etc., and their results are exceptionally good. The Japanese government, in view of the current situation, has newly designated air defense factories and established military supply factories based on the emergency measures outline for specific aircraft factories. Minister of Military Supplies Toyota gave instructions to the employees of the new factories on the 9th, in order to encourage the rapid development of the new factories.

Vigorously Promote Increased Food Production

Tokyo, 9th (Central News Agency dispatch) – The Japanese Ministry of Agriculture and Commerce reorganized the wartime food production promotion headquarters and expanded its authority to actively carry out the increased production plan. It has now also established a wartime agricultural corps. At the same time, it has established a central wartime food production headquarters, merging the wartime agricultural corps and the recently disbanded agricultural patriotic society. The Minister of Agriculture and Commerce will serve as the headquarters chief, and the president of the wartime agricultural corps will serve as the deputy headquarters chief, in order to achieve close communication between the central government and the local areas. They will actively guide the national volunteer corps and the farmer corps to engage in agricultural work and vigorously promote increased food production.

### Minister of Home Affairs Awards the Governor of Okinawa Prefecture

Tokyo, 9th (Central News Agency dispatch) – Minister of Home Affairs Abe, recognizing that Governor Shimada of Okinawa Prefecture consistently cooperated with the Japanese military and led the prefectural people to fight bravely during the decisive battle on Okinawa, the vanguard of the Japanese mainland, and that his loyalty was commendable, has granted him an award and ordered that all local supervisory offices and prefectures be notified in order to permanently recognize his merits. It is reported that this is the first time a minister has awarded a subordinate official. The award will soon be delivered to Fukuoka Prefecture for Ishiba, the Okinawa Prefectural Minister of Internal Affairs, to receive on behalf of the Governor.

### Stilwell Acknowledges the Difficulty of Operations Against Japan

Stockholm, 9th (Central News Agency dispatch) – An Associated Press dispatch from Okinawa stated that General Stilwell, commander of the U.S. Tenth Army, told a group of reporters on the 7th that in addition to the current aerial offensive, battles would also be fought in the Japanese mainland, North China, and Manchuria. The main points of his statement were as follows: The terrain of Japan is as difficult as that of Okinawa. It took three months to occupy Okinawa Island, and operations on the Japanese mainland will be even more arduous and long-term. Even if the Japanese army is conquered on its mainland, a large number of Japanese troops still exist in Manchuria. After the end of operations on the Japanese mainland, I do not know what policy the United States will adopt, but in my personal opinion, I firmly believe that war must continue even after the conquest of Japan.

### U.S. Air Force Stationed in France Transferred to the Pacific

Zurich, 9th (Central News Agency dispatch) – According to a dispatch from Paris, the U.S. Ninth Air Force ordered the soldiers of the 50th Fighter Squadron and the 358th Fighter Squadron on the 6th to move from French bases to Le Havre and begin advancing to the Pacific.

### Hu Yukun Broadcasts

### Wuhan After the Bombing

— Kang Min

I once heard someone say, "Very few houses remain in the urban area of Hankou after the bombing." After I visited, I realized that seeing is believing, and those words I heard before were not credible. Naturally, you can see some remnants of destruction, but the few that were damaged are quickly being rebuilt, and the entire city is still thriving.

Political Improvements

Since Ye Xun came to power in Hubei, he has spared no effort in reforming the government. To revitalize Wuhan, he implemented the "Four Consolidations, Five Transformations, and Six No's" policy. All the people of Wuhan are eagerly anticipating the realization of this policy to save them from their plight. The so-called "Four Consolidations" are: consolidating the dilapidated into the complete; consolidating the chaotic into the orderly; consolidating the filthy into the clean; consolidating the nominal into the practical. The "Five Transformations" are: transforming the complex into the simple; transforming the ambiguous into the clear; transforming private interests into public interests; transforming the lax into the tense; transforming the chaotic into the orderly. The "Six No's" require: no multiple levies; no forced requisitions; no raising money under false pretenses; no creating difficulties and making demands; no intimidation and extortion; no wronging good people. If this policy can truly be implemented practically, I believe that the people will return, and the market will prosper, as expected.

Hubei Province Finances

Since the start of the war, it has been difficult to increase revenue, and the province's finances have become even more strained, with income and expenses unable to balance. This is even worse now. At the Hubei Provincial Government meeting this spring, it was reported that after reorganizing land tax revenue and changing to in-kind collection, it is estimated that the minimum annual income will be about 600,000 shi of rice, enough for the government's expenses and military salaries for this year. It is also planned to allocate 1,500 shi of rice from the rice collected as taxes from the counties near Wuhan to supply the military police in Wuhan. In the future, with increased treatment in Wuhan, the police can be strengthened, and law and order can be improved, simplifying politics. However, as Governor Gu said, it is difficult to maintain with the past tax revenue of only more than three million yuan per month. Now, after major reorganization, the treasury revenue has doubled. The entire strength of Hubei Province is being used to irrigate this withered flower in Central China.

People's Suffering

In Wuhan, it is not only the civil servants who live in poverty, but also the common people. The people struggling on the poverty line are busy all day long, and their spirit is tenacious. They are busy rushing to the market, going to the office, and many poor people are engaged in even more arduous labor. There are also many people sweeping salt, working hard all day for every grain of salt, because it is a world where salt is scarce. The people of Shanghai are worried about the high price of rice, but they hope that salt will be transported in. Every grain of salt left on the road will attract the attention of many salt sweepers. The people rely on black market salt, and this salt mixed with dust saves the people of Wuhan from bland food. In the midst of the salt shortage, God does not help, and the price of rice has also risen to more than 100,000.

Famous Historical Sites

The Yellow Crane Tower in Wuchang overlooks the Yangtze River. From there, you can see the entire city of Wuhan and the scenery of the Yangtze River. Unfortunately, part of it is forbidden for tourists to look at. Very few of the books collected in the Baobing Hall remain. Gudesi Temple in the suburbs of Hankou is built in imitation of classical Indian style and enshrines Jigong, the Four Heavenly Kings, and Buddhas. Guiyuan Temple is located west of Dabie Mountain in Hanyang. The temple is very popular, and enshrines five hundred Arhats, the Niangniang Hall, the liberation pond, etc. The area outside the temple was originally very desolate, but now the open space outside the temple has been completely occupied by merchants, with stalls everywhere, making it very lively. Boyaqintai on Yuehu Lake in Hanyang was originally a popular summer retreat, with lotus flowers blooming in the lake, but now there is no scenery to speak of. The houses on the Qin Terrace are simple and dilapidated, and are inhabited by refugees. In places such as Yingwuzhou and Shilipo, it is said that there are historical sites, but they are now buried, and only the descendants of our Chinese nation are seen, working hard for their livelihoods all day long.

Educational Poverty

Education in Wuhan is poor: since the bombing last year, manpower and financial resources have suffered blows. Now all the merged primary and secondary schools, in this time of difficult material resources, cannot be expected to achieve ideal results. The authorities are now doing their best to try to maintain them. The reporter saw innocent children in a certain primary school studying in classrooms with dilapidated walls. After the roof was destroyed, it was covered with reed mats, and the teachers were still teaching tirelessly. This spirit is truly admirable. A certain provincial middle school in Caidian (about sixty miles from Hanyang) has a large number of students and is the only safe area. The reporter talked to a graduating student, who sighed that there was no place to pursue further studies here, and said: unless you go to the interior or Shanghai.

Charitable Work

Charitable work here is not very developed. The Qiaokou Jiaqing Nursery is the only remaining nursery in Hankou. Sister Zhang Delesa, an old nun, is in charge. More than thirty half-starved old and weak people, with their sallow and haggard faces, are doing all the lightest and simplest jobs. The infants are malnourished and only drink lotus root powder a few times a day. This charitable organization has a considerable history. In the past, it raised more than two hundred orphans, and the expenses were provided by the Catholic Church. Since the funding stopped, a few old nuns have been reluctantly doing their best to maintain it until now, and it is difficult to provide even two thin bowls of corn porridge for a meal. The reporter saw a white-haired woman in her eighties, said to be the first orphan admitted to the orphanage. She is now ill and sleeping very quietly. Their future life is truly unimaginable.

### General Okamura Pledges His Determination to Fight; Yesterday Hosted Key Propaganda Personnel in the Capital

Nanjing, 9th (Central News Agency dispatch) – General Okamura, commander-in-chief of the Japanese Expeditionary Army in China, hosted officials from the propaganda and reporting agencies of the capital at the Nanjing Xiehang Society on Zhongshan North Road at 3:00 PM on the 9th. Those in attendance included Vice Minister Sun, Director Wu, Director Wu of the Propaganda Department, President Guo and Vice President Hu of the Central News Agency, Vice President Jiang and Editor-in-Chief Min of the Central Daily News, and Acting President Zhang and Editor-in-Chief Wang of the China News Agency, totaling more than ten people. General Okamura personally hosted the gathering, and the atmosphere was very harmonious. General Okamura first explained the general war situation in great detail, and then pledged the determination of the Japanese Expeditionary Army in mainland China to fight. The gathering ended at 5:00 PM.

### Future Adjustments to Postal Rates Must Be Approved by the Executive Yuan

Nanjing, 9th (Central News Agency dispatch) – The Shanghai office of the Directorate General of Posts requested the Ministry of Construction last month to be allowed to adjust postal rates. At the same time, in view of the fact that previous increases were implemented only to require adjustments again due to rising prices, affecting the lives of postal workers and postal rates, a temporary measure for postal rate surcharges was drafted and submitted to the Ministry of Construction for approval. This measure was to collect postal rate surcharges in accordance with rice prices in various regions, and it was planned to adjust them once a month. It is now understood that the Ministry of Construction believes that the implementation of this measure would be difficult for several reasons. First, rice prices vary greatly from region to region, so postal rates would inevitably be difficult to stabilize. Second, increasing postal rates monthly according to the increase in black market prices would inevitably stimulate a cycle and affect the rise in prices. Third, the postal service is a state-run public utility, and its purpose is to facilitate the public, so this would increase the burden on the people and would not be reasonable. Therefore, it was not approved. In the future, any increase in postal rates must be submitted to the Ministry and approved by the Executive Yuan before it can be implemented.

### Central Party Headquarters Weekly Meeting

Nanjing, 9th (Central News Agency dispatch) – The Central Headquarters of the Chinese Kuomintang held its 257th Sun Yat-sen Memorial Week in the main hall of the headquarters at 10:00 AM this morning.

Afterwards, a ceremony commemorating entry into the war was held. The meeting adjourned at about 11:00 AM.

### Mobilize Party Members to Assist in Locust Control

Nanjing, 9th (Central News Agency dispatch) – Minister Mei of the Central Department of People's Training, in view of the fact that locust nymphs are still a problem in Zhenjiang and Yanziji in the capital, in order to quickly reduce locusts to save crops, specifically telegraphed the Jiangsu Provincial Party Headquarters and the Nanjing Special City Party Headquarters to quickly supervise local party headquarters to mobilize party members to assist the government in going to the countryside to eliminate locusts in order to avoid disaster.

Editorial

### Wartime Morality and Wartime Economy

What deeply concerns us today is not only the complexity and difficulty of economic problems, but also the decline and degradation of moral values. For example, the price of rice has been gradually rising again these past few days. If we try to analyze the reasons, it is true that the amount of rice stored in various places is not very abundant, but the main reasons are the following two points: First, although the restrictions on the movement of rice have been lifted, extortion along the way still exists; second, people with money are taking this opportunity to go to the countryside to buy rice, paying high prices and hoarding it locally, thus limiting the source of rice and raising the price of rice through artificial means. Both of these stem from selfishness.

Also, for example, because of the rampant issuance of allocation orders and the surge in discounting, the financial authorities have ordered the suspension of allocation orders and, on the one hand, allowed various banks to issue wooden tickets. However, what is the essence of a bank note but a disguised form of credit money? Suppose each bank uses a piece of paper to exchange for physical goods or gold. In one day, before settlement, it can use empty credit to operate the trick of turning nothing into something. How can this be inspected and cracked down on? In this situation, the disadvantages are not only the one-sided expansion of credit money, but also the possible disruption of the entire economic society. Although the disadvantages are not what the authorities could have foreseen, they stem from the selfishness of various banks.

Therefore, wartime economic policies should be based on wartime moral values. Otherwise, they will inevitably be exploited, breeding malpractices. Therefore, what deeply concerns us today is not only the complexity and difficulty of economic problems, but also the decline and degradation of moral values.

Recently, people from Tokyo who came to Shanghai witnessed the living conditions in Japan under air raids. One thing that moved us was that although the wartime economy was more difficult than before, wartime morality was even higher than before. Under the air raids, some people's houses were burned, and some people suffered disasters, but everyone lived a life of sharing what they had and helping each other in times of need. Because at that time, people could more deeply realize that being selfish was useless. The rich could lose their reliance on money overnight. Only in the spirit of mutual assistance and love could everyone do their best to contribute to the country.

Although the situation in Shanghai is not as serious as in Tokyo, we should recognize that all selfish behavior and speculative transactions can only lead to social unrest and economic crisis. We should also realize that the time to prepare for a rainy day is now. Everyone should bring out their conscience and ability and use wartime morality to cooperate with the wartime economy.

Those with power should not abuse their power, and those with money should not misuse their money. Everything should be based on morality, so that wartime economic policies can be effective and the wartime livelihood problems can be stabilized.

### The Chongqing Political Council: Second Day of Meeting

Guangzhou, September 9th, Central News Agency: According to a Chongqing broadcast, the National Political Council held its second meeting at 8:00 AM on the 8th. 176 councilors were present, with Mo Dehui presiding. After the Secretariat read the minutes of the first meeting and the received documents, Weng Wenhao, Minister of Economic Affairs and concurrently Director of the Wartime Production Bureau, reported on economic and wartime production work. Weng first discussed the principles of economic construction and important regulations, followed by the significance of wartime production.

Guangzhou, September 9th, Central News Agency: According to a Chongqing Central News Agency dispatch: The first session of the Fourth National Political Council began on the morning of the 7th. After a speech by Chiang Kai-shek, a preparatory meeting was held in the afternoon. This meeting was presided over by a presidium of seven members, including Zhang Boling, Wu Yifang, Li Huang, Wang Yunwu, and Wang Shijie, who divided responsibilities for various committees. At the preparatory meeting, the Minister of Military Affairs, Chen, first reported on the military situation, followed by approximately fifty inquiries. The meeting has been unusually tense since its opening. A key issue for discussion at this Political Council session is the government's forceful promotion of constitutional implementation following the Sixth Plenary Session of the Kuomintang. Furthermore, Chongqing's hope to convene a National Assembly on November 12th, and whether this can succeed, hinges on the decisions made during this Political Council session. Consequently, Yan'an and the "Third Force" are paying close attention to its outcome.

US-Chongqing Cooperation: Discordant in Appearance

Inland, September 9th, Central News Agency: Following Chiang Kai-shek's meeting with a group of reporters on the 28th of last month, foreign correspondents unanimously declared that Chiang's intentions were exceptionally circumspect. The central topic of the Q&A session was focused on the topic of landing operations. Chiang's deeply considered attitude was a way of expressing "uncertainty about the American military's plans for landing operations". As landing operations are now a present reality, the American military authorities still aren't sharing their confidential plans with Chongqing. Therefore, those preoccupied with formulating countermeasures to the landing operations are not the Japanese military, but Chongqing's own forces. At this time of what is called a "total counteroffensive" against Japan, the United States is not only failing to cooperate closely with Chongqing, but is now adopting an exploitative attitude toward Chongqing. This kind of self-serving realism is difficult for Chiang Kai-shek to accept. From last autumn until now, American policy toward China can be roughly divided into three stages: The first phase was the high-pressure policy represented by Stilwell, which used the excuse of opening supply lines to Chiang to force cooperation between the Kuomintang and the Communists. The second phase was the failure of Hurley and Wedemeyer's work on Kuomintang-Communist cooperation. The third phase has shifted to a realism that deals only with the Chiang government. Because of American realism, China has endured much suffering, and Chiang Kai-shek has not forgotten this. Therefore, at the Political Council meeting on July 7th, he said that while military cooperation between the US and Chiang had reached a satisfactory level, the major task of destroying the enemy in the Chinese theater must be carried out by us. Chiang Kai-shek's deep concern about America's frightening realism is, of course, reasonable.

### Stalin and Song Ziwen Hold Third Meeting

Stockholm, September 9th, Central News Agency: According to reports from Moscow, Soviet leader Stalin received Chongqing Executive Yuan President Song Ziwen on Saturday night.

Seeking a Solution to the Xinjiang Issue

Stockholm, September 9th, Moscow dispatch: Since Song Ziwen's arrival in Moscow, he has met with Soviet government leaders twice to discuss matters. Although the content of the discussions is not yet clear, some well-informed sources believe that it is related to the successive visits of Mongolian People's Republic Premier Choibalsan to the Soviet Union. Reuters Moscow reported on the 7th that the Moscow talks between the Soviet and Chongqing sides are not progressing well. It can be inferred that the main content of the agreement is the issue of the United Nations' cooperation with Chongqing, judging from Song Ziwen's repeated telegrams to Chiang Kai-shek for consultation and the gradual notification of the contents of the meeting to the US and British governments. However, Moscow diplomatic circles said that Choibalsan's visit to the Soviet Union is completely unrelated to Song Ziwen's mission. However, according to a report by the Far East correspondent of a British weekly, Song Ziwen's visit to the Soviet Union is actually related to the issue of mining assistance in Xinjiang, the gist of which is as follows: In 1942, when the Xinjiang government had disputes with the Soviet Union over border issues, the government expressed goodwill to Chongqing. At that time, the Soviet Union suddenly stopped mining assistance as retaliation. As a result, the province, which had relied on railways to trade with the Soviet Union for years, suffered a major blow. Two years ago, the Chongqing government began developing the province, and Chiang Kai-shek went to the province to encourage development, but without Soviet assistance, it was difficult to achieve success. Therefore, he ordered Song Ziwen to visit and discuss the mining development issue with Stalin, seeking his forceful assistance.

### Soviet Union Plans to Use German Prisoners of War to Assist in Post-War Reconstruction; Will Propose at the Three-Power Conference

Zurich, September 9th, Central News Agency: According to a London dispatch, a certain British newspaper recently detailed the Soviet Union's intentions regarding German prisoners of war: In order to rebuild the country, the Soviet Union intends to use four million German prisoners of war. However, most of the German prisoners of war are currently in the hands of the Allied forces, so the Soviet authorities are now asking the US and British governments to transfer all members of the SS, the secret police, and Nazi Party members among the prisoners to the Soviet Union. This issue is likely to be one of the important topics on the agenda of the upcoming Three-Power Conference.

### Provisional Regulations for the Trial of War Criminals

Stockholm, September 9th, Central News Agency: According to a London dispatch, the British War Office announced yesterday that provisional regulations regarding the trial of war criminals and violators of wartime laws (such as mistreatment of prisoners of war or residents of occupied areas) have been stipulated in a certain special military order. All procedures stipulated in the regulations must be strictly followed by the military courts in the British occupied areas. However, the military courts in these occupied areas should not accept cases of war crimes that must be handled in a certain way after being agreed upon by the British authorities and the governments of other countries. According to the special military order mentioned above, general British military commanders are granted special powers, so that they have the right to convene military court meetings to directly try all war criminals, and also have the right to transfer this special power to lower-level commanders. At present, the trial of all war criminals will begin after the special power of attorney is issued. The types of punishments are as follows: death penalty, imprisonment, confiscation of property, fines. The last two items apply to those who intentionally damage property. There are also regulations stipulating that if the convicted person is not satisfied with the punishment, they can appeal to a higher authority.

### Yesterday's 19th Air Defense Day Implemented Comprehensive Training; Relevant Chinese and Japanese Officials Visited Various Districts

Yesterday (9th) was the 19th Air Defense Day. The Municipal Civil Air Defense Headquarters, following precedent, implemented various air defense drills. People throughout the city were in a state of air defense, and the mood was extremely tense. Details are as follows:

Alarm Transmission

The alarm drill began at 1:30 PM. At the same time, alarm transmission drills were also implemented. Each air defense jurisdiction was supervised by its respective police precinct. Outstanding air defense team members were drawn from each Lianbao (joint guarantee unit) to form an alarm transmission liaison team. The director of the second section, based on the alarm issuance time, ordered the liaison team members to use bicycles and copper gongs to transmit alarms throughout the district to each Bao (guarantee unit). Then, the alarm transmission team members of each Bao used their voices to transmit the alarm to each road, street, and lane, and erected flag markers at key traffic points and prominent locations for identification. At 1:30 PM, the training preparatory alarm was issued. At 1:45 PM, the training alert alarm was issued. At 2:00 PM, the training air raid alarm was issued. Strict traffic control was implemented throughout the city. Personnel were dispatched to form traffic control squads to direct traffic. At 3:20 PM, the training air raid alarm was lifted. At 3:30 PM, the training alert alarm was lifted.

Light Control

From 8:30 PM to 9:30 PM was the training alert light control. From 9:30 PM to 10:30 PM was the training continuous air raid light control. During these two light control drills, police and Baojia personnel formed light control supervision squads, divided into groups to patrol each district, earnestly guiding and strictly implementing corrections. Furthermore, each police precinct dispatched two or three groups to implement vehicle light control throughout the city. The light control of small boats on the Huangpu River and Suzhou Creek was supervised and guided by the water police. At the same time, the Municipal Civil Air Defense Headquarters broadcast general information about light control via radio, and frequently corrected problem areas, urging residents in those areas to pay attention to improvements.

District-Specific Training

Official Inspections

Each district designated appropriate locations to implement comprehensive drills, all of which were implemented upon receiving radio broadcasts, assuming the implementation of comprehensive drills. Each precinct chief, along with the section chiefs, served as commanders, drawing outstanding air defense team members to guide the public in rescue, firefighting, bomb disposal, and shelter seeking drills. Traffic control was implemented in and around the training areas. At the same time, upon hearing the broadcast assuming preparation for a wave attack, air defense activities and timely evacuation exercises were repeatedly held. In particular, emergency evacuation drills were thoroughly implemented, guiding citizens to participate in the drills. Officials of all levels of relevant agencies also visited the various districts in three shifts. The first group included Chief of Staff Deng, Deputy Directors Man Du and Sugihara of the Police Bureau, who inspected the Laozha, Xincheng, and Jiangning districts. The second group included Defense Commander Yamaguchi, Police Defense Director Hiraoka, General Director Noguchi, and Police Chief Kobayashi, who inspected the Jing'an Temple, Huashan, Lujiawan, and North Sichuan Road districts. The third group included the commander of the Japanese Marine Corps in Shanghai, Tsukazaki, Fire Chief Tsukazaki, and Advisor Ide Kiyomi, who inspected the Tilanqiao, Yangshupu, Huangpu, Hongkou, and West Hongkou districts. In their inspections, they all convened police and Baojia personnel for exhortations, offering many words of encouragement.

Local Training

This local comprehensive training was held in the Tilanqiao, Yulin Road, and Yu district areas. The above four districts were designated as air defense jurisdictions. Each precinct chief designated appropriate locations to direct Baojia personnel and the entire district's residents to implement major comprehensive air defense drills such as rescue, firefighting, bomb disposal, and emergency evacuation. All were held in the morning, and thorough traffic control was implemented at the training locations. Military and police authorities and officials of all levels visited for inspections. Chinese, Japanese, and foreign Baojia personnel, as well as people of various nationalities, worked together as one, cooperating in exercises, and the results were quite satisfactory. In the afternoon, each district still implemented comprehensive drills and strict light control and traffic control according to the city's air defense plan.

Precinct Chief Xu Minchou, Deputy Precinct Chief Imamura Hiko, and First Inspection District Chief Inspector Rong Hanyi and other officials also attended the inspection. At 2:00 PM, as soon as the siren sounded, the emergency evacuation began. Customers and male and female employees in the department store were guided by the department store's air defense team to evacuate to the basement emergency shelter. At the same time, more than one hundred men, women, old and young people selected from each Bao, pretending to be passers-by, wore identity cards with their names, ages, native places, and addresses. They were guided by ropes and fences from the surrounding doors, with Baojia personnel maintaining order, guiding them into the shelter, and simulating heavy smoke, with everyone covering their mouths and noses with wool cloths and towels. The shelter was surrounded by posts to maintain order, and white flags with red horizontal stripes were used to guide them. In a very short time, the shelter was filled with more than a thousand people, and the mood was extremely tense. Deputy Director Watanabe visited the underground shelter before the drill ended. At the same time, other districts also conducted similar large-scale emergency evacuation drills.

### Regulating People's Food and Procuring Miscellaneous Grains: A Discussion with Chen Binhe, Member of the People's Food Regulation Committee

The Municipal Advisory Committee has established a "People's Food Regulation Committee" specifically to procure miscellaneous grains to regulate the city's food supply. The committee has already decided on the first phase of procurement methods for miscellaneous grains (see various newspapers of July 3rd) and answered questions about participation in the purchase procedures (see various newspapers of July 6th). Recently, Chen Binhe, a member of the committee, told reporters that they have received letters from all walks of life inquiring about the meaning of regulating people's food and procuring miscellaneous grains. In addition to the previous answers, here is a supplementary response:

Regulating People's Food is a Temporary Solution

(Question) Can the collective procurement of miscellaneous grains to regulate people's food achieve the expected goal? (Answer) Collective procurement of miscellaneous grains is originally a temporary solution to regulate people's food. The fundamental solution lies in the comprehensive control of rice, flour, wheat, and miscellaneous grains. Only with comprehensive control of food can the powers of procuring funds, transportation, purchase, and distribution be unified. Before comprehensive control is possible, collective procurement of miscellaneous grains to regulate people's food is an urgent task. Collective procurement can reasonably solve problems such as procuring funds, transportation safety, and reducing profits.

(Question) When participating units pay, there is no review, so how can it be verified whether they are qualified? (Answer) The Fuxing Bank is only responsible for collecting payments. The People's Food Regulation Committee will be responsible for reviewing them in the future. Those who conceal information, purchase excessive amounts, or engage in speculation will have their purchase rights revoked.

Responsible for Guaranteeing Transportation Safety

(Question) Is the responsibility for procurement and transportation safety guaranteed? (Answer) The procurement matters are entrusted to the Flour and Wheat Control Committee, which will naturally be responsible for guaranteeing them.

(Question) Where should one contact if there are questions regarding participation in the purchase procedures? (Answer) The participation methods are extremely simple and have already been announced clearly. In fact, there is nothing questionable about them. The People's Food Regulation Committee is only a temporary organization established by the Advisory Committee and has no staff. If there are announcements of methods, they will be announced in the newspapers at any time.

Precautions Should Be Taken Against Speculative Rice Purchases

(Question) After the authorities announced the emergency measures for rice and grain, the source of rice and grain became smooth, but recently the price of rice and grain has been rising again. Why is this? (Answer) There are many reasons for the recent rise in rice prices, but the main reason is that some wealthy people are taking the opportunity to purchase speculatively, thus creating a situation of supply exceeding demand. At the same time, at this time of the year when the new harvest is not yet available, the rice reserves in rice-producing areas are already weak and insufficient to meet the needs of speculative purchases. Therefore, it is necessary to strictly guard against the selfishness of wealthy people who only care about themselves and disregard government policies. Secondly, in order to reduce rice and grain consumption, it is necessary to consume more miscellaneous grains. Charitable organizations should first switch to eating miscellaneous grains completely. The general public should not need to grind brown rice into white rice, because miscellaneous grains and brown rice are actually better than white rice in terms of nutritional value.

### Forged Bank Drafts Discovered; Banking Industry Hopes Authorities Will Investigate Thoroughly

The city's banking industry used to use remittance slips, but because there were many forgeries, they decided to stop using them. At the same time, each bank and money shop carefully issued parallel horizontal line immediate drafts in accordance with the restriction methods to replace the circulation of remittance slips. However, only one week after the drafts were in use since the 3rd of this month, forgeries have been discovered. If this is allowed to continue, the consequences will be unimaginable. Yesterday, reporters interviewed people in the financial sector about this matter to inquire about their opinions. Everyone said that someone forging drafts is still a rare occurrence, but a single spark can start a prairie fire. If precautions are not taken early, the reputation of the banking industry will be greatly affected, and it will also be extremely detrimental to hindering wartime finance. The responsible parties in the banking industry attach great importance to the occurrence of this matter. They are conducting careful research on the printing paper, national emblem, and issuance date of the forged drafts, and are determined to get to the bottom of the matter in the short term. In addition, they are actively studying methods to prevent forgery and are studying the precise manufacturing and issuance characteristics of the drafts. On the other hand, they also hope that the financial authorities will strictly investigate and handle the forgeries to avoid harming the public.

Regulations on Withdrawing Cash

In order to regulate the cash needs of the market, each bank and money shop in the city has separately formulated temporary measures for customers to withdraw cash. All Class A commercial banks can withdraw 30% to 20% of the lowest balance of the customer's account from the previous week. That is, if the lowest deposit last week was one million yuan, 200,000 to 300,000 yuan in cash can be withdrawn this week. At least 10% can be withdrawn from other small banks and money shops. Most of these temporary measures were implemented starting yesterday (9th).

### Gold and Securities Market Conditions

Yesterday's market conditions for gold and securities were as follows: Expiring bonds, 3.39 million yuan, up 60,000 yuan from last Saturday. Fourth term, 3.5 million yuan, up 340,000 yuan from last Saturday.

### Central Reserve Bank Issues New 5,000 Yuan Notes

In order to adjust the city's cash needs, the Central Reserve Bank issued a new 1945 edition gray-green 5,000 yuan note yesterday. The patterns, designs, seals, and signatures on the front and back of the note are the same as the gray-green 5,000 yuan notes previously issued by the bank, but the serial number on the front of the note is printed with Western letters. This gray-green 5,000 yuan note is universally valid with all types of banknotes issued by the bank.

### Baojia Office Revises Methods for Replacing Heads of Households; Adjusts Baojia Administrative Fees

Regarding the handling of methods for replacing heads of households, the Baojia Office of the Municipal Police Bureau has revised them as follows: If the head of the household moves out of the household and has not completed the move procedure, when the head of the household is not replaced, the new head of household can be selected to perform the duties of the head of household based on the following methods upon application by a interested party and proof by the Baojia chief. Those who can prove that they have continued to lease the house are allowed to serve as the new head of household. Those who can prove that they have been entrusted by the original head of household are allowed to be the acting head of household. If the head of household is selected and there are no candidates for the first two items, the new head of household can be selected from among the deputy heads of the household. This is a necessary procedure for Baojia administration and does not affect the legal rights and obligations between the former and subsequent heads of household and deputy household heads, nor does it affect proof of property rights.

The Baojia administrative fees for various household registration matters handled by the district bureaus under the Municipal Police Bureau, such as applying for a residence certificate, moving, birth, death, and applying for a replacement of a lost residence certificate, will be adjusted starting on the 16th of this month. The fee for applying for a residence certificate, reporting a move, birth, or death will be uniformly changed to 100 yuan per item. The fee for applying for a replacement of a lost residence certificate will be changed to 500 yuan per item. The changes will be implemented for both Chinese and foreigners at the same time.

### Handover Ceremony Held Yesterday for New and Old Health Bureau Directors

The handover ceremony for the new and outgoing directors of the Municipal Health Bureau was solemnly held in the city government auditorium at 10:30 AM yesterday (9th). Municipal Counselor Shen Guanzhun attended to oversee the handover. After the handover was completed, the entire staff was introduced, and the new director, Yuan Juejie, gave a speech, stating that the central work of the bureau in the future will be: 1. Garbage disposal; 2. Intensifying epidemic prevention; 3. Strictly banning unsanitary cool drinks and food items; 4. Air raid rescue. These are the most urgent central tasks at present, and they are also the tasks that the predecessors were determined to complete but did not. He plans to devote his full efforts to them.

### Minutes of the Second Friendship Meeting of the Newspaper's Free Education Committee: Reviewing General Issues of Free Schools

The Free Education Committee of this newspaper held its second friendship meeting at Xiangxue Garden, No. 990 Taishan Road, on the afternoon of the 7th. More than 30 people attended, including all committee members and teachers from the 1st to 10th free schools. First, the principals of each school successively reported on the actual teaching situation, the reasons for student absenteeism, and the situation of student family visits. They all said that the students of the free schools lived in extreme hardship, often not having enough to eat every day, which affected their health and nutrition. Some were also engaged in small businesses, hard labor, or apprenticeships, and some had returned to their hometowns.

Next, the supervisors reported that the teachers and instructors of each school were conscientious, and the students were quite able to abide by the school rules, even better than ordinary elementary schools.
