### National Army Awaits Orders to Enter Shenyang; Changchun Negotiations Near Conclusion; Transportation Restored Between Harbin and Dalian

[Our Newspaper, Chongqing, 9th] The Sino-Soviet negotiations are still in progress. Our chief representative is General Xiong Shihui, and the focus of the negotiations is in Chongqing and Changchun. Soviet Ambassador to China, Petrov, will return to Moscow to report on his duties after the negotiations reach an agreement. The National Army's takeover of the Northeast is a matter of internal affairs. Since the signing of the Sino-Soviet Agreement in August, both parties have already reached a common foundation on general principles. The National Army's airlift and entry into the Northeast along the Beining Railway are local technical issues. It is heard that the results of the airlift negotiations will be announced in the coming days. Previous reports of the Soviet army disarming the communist forces in Changchun have not been confirmed.

[United Press, Chongqing, 9th] Reliable sources this morning reported that Sino-Soviet negotiations on the National Army's airlift to Changchun and the land forces entering Shenyang are being held in Changchun and are nearing completion today. Some points have not yet been resolved, but it is expected that Special Envoy for Northeast Diplomacy, Chiang Ching-kuo, and Marshal Malinovsky will be able to handle these issues properly within a few days. General Du Yuming's troops are very close to Shenyang, but are still waiting for the Soviet Union's "green light" to avoid any unforeseen circumstances. It is said that the Soviet Union is currently guarding Shenyang, and the Chinese authorities here are insisting on a peaceful and bloodless reoccupation of the city, which is very likely. After arriving in Chongqing on Friday, General Du met with Chairman Chiang yesterday, and it is believed that they discussed the Northeast issue.

[Central News Agency, Changchun, 8th] Changchun has had sunny weather for several days, and the city is calm. Communist troops no longer appear in public in the city. The Soviet army is also strictly cracking down on soldiers with improper attire. Communist troops along the Changchun Railway have been ordered to withdraw. The Changchun Railway, from Harbin in the north to Dalian in the south, was opened to traffic on the 25th of last month. There is more passenger traffic than freight traffic. The Sino-Soviet Changchun Railway Board of Directors and Supervisors is located in Changchun, and the Railway Bureau is located in Harbin. Three of our five directors have arrived, but all supervisors are missing. Four of the five Soviet directors have arrived, and all supervisors have arrived. Both parties have now begun working.

[Our Newspaper, Radio Reception] A Chongqing spokesperson claimed that there was indeed collusion between the Chinese Communist Party and Zhang Xueshi. It is said that Zhang Xueshi has accepted Zhu De's order to withdraw troops from Shenyang in order to preserve the strength of the communist forces. General Du Yuming has reported this matter to Chairman Chiang.

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 9th] More than two hundred staff members of the Northeast Headquarters and its affiliated administrative personnel are still in Chongqing and are scheduled to be airlifted to Beiping before the 20th of this month. In addition, Sheng Zizhuang, Director of the General Affairs Department of the Northeast Headquarters, has been dispatched to Chongqing to handle the closing affairs of the Chongqing office and will return to Beiping in the coming days.

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 9th] Du Pinsan, a representative of the people of Suiyuan Province, said that the communist troops had reinforced their siege of Suiyuan and Baotou five times, and the blockade had lasted nearly two months. Food and fuel were running out, and the 300,000 people in the two cities would either die from artillery fire or from freezing and starvation. More than ten groups in Suiyuan Province have sent telegrams in tears of blood, requesting assistance. In addition, Commander Fu specially ordered the troops to reduce their rations and allocated more than 100,000 jin of miscellaneous grains to relieve the citizens.

[Central News Agency, Tianjin, 9th] Since the National Army entered West Tianjin, some communist troops have repented of their past mistakes and have surrendered to the National Army with their weapons.

They were monitored and labored in Japan for as long as four years, digging tunnels underground, never seeing the light of day, and often not having a full meal for several days. Their clothing was not made of cotton; they were only issued a set of clothes made of cement powder and paper. When they were rescued by the American army before returning home, they knew nothing about the Japanese surrender. When the Allied forces told them the truth, they burst into tears and congratulated each other.

Xu said that the current priority is to restore order and stabilize people's hearts, such as rushing to repair poles and lines for telegraphs, and using radio for reporting in the meantime. City telephones and long-distance telephones will be repaired as soon as possible. In addition to military vehicles, the railway will resume passenger and freight cars, and discussions have been completed with the responsible personnel. Xu continued that he himself is also assisting the air force station in various ways to make proper arrangements, and has instructed the police bureau to assist. Primary and secondary schools will resume classes immediately, and factories and mines will be ordered to resume work immediately. Essential components that have been transported away or destroyed by the communist forces will be repaired as quickly as possible. In any case, work will be resumed in the current state to increase production. As for household registration, land registration, police, sanitation, and other matters, the effective practices of the past may still be adopted, and those that do not conform to the people's sentiments will be corrected. Moreover, exorbitant taxes will be eliminated immediately. The people of Jinzhou are becoming more and more stable, and county magistrates and mayors temporarily dispatched by the Commander-in-Chief's Office are instructed to continue to serve. There is a system in the Northeast called "荷出", which means transporting all agricultural products to Japan as much as possible, so that the people of the Northeast are often not full at every meal.

### Shandong Guerrilla Forces Thoroughly Reorganized; Expected to be Completed by the End of This Month

[Central News Agency, Jinan, 8th] More than one hundred units of guerrilla forces throughout the province, which have supported the situation in Shandong for eight years during the Anti-Japanese War, are now being thoroughly reorganized and are expected to be completed by the end of December. These guerrilla forces have made contributions to the Anti-Japanese War. However, the development situation in the past eight years has been complicated, with numerous designations and large organizations. After the Deputy Commander-in-Chief's Office of the Eleventh War Zone arrived in Jinan, it began to reorganize them. It was decided to reorganize them according to three principles: (1) Reorganize them into local teams. (2) Allocate them to established units in Shandong. (3) Establish several independent regiments and one security regiment under the Deputy Commander-in-Chief's Office. Each county will have a security brigade, all under the jurisdiction of the Provincial Security Office. The original designations of Advance Column, Security Brigade, Security Regiment, Special Service Brigade, and Special Service Regiment will all be abolished. In addition, the designations of some miscellaneous troops that have long been reorganized or no longer exist have also been explicitly abolished.

### First Trial of Traitors in Beiping and Tianjin to be Handled by Hebei High Court; Many Traitors Arrested in Tianjin Were Henchmen of the Enemy Army

[Central News Agency, Beiping, 8th] Responsible persons from relevant parties said that the work of arresting traitors in Beiping and Tianjin began on the 6th and was mostly completed by the 8th. The steps for handling traitors have been determined: first, the responsible agency will investigate and interrogate them, and then transfer them to the court for legal action. The first trial of traitors in Beiping will be handled by the pseudo-Hebei High Court. The High Court prosecutor will first investigate and file a public prosecution, and then transfer the case to the criminal court for trial. In addition to the Criminal Law and the Criminal Procedure Law, the laws cited for prosecuting traitors include the "Regulations on Traitors' Surrender," the "Regulations on Punishing Traitors," and the "Regulations on Handling Traitor Cases." The provisions of the "Regulations on Traitors' Surrender" apply to those who surrender before August 10th, which has now expired. Those who surrender now cannot be handled according to these regulations. Traitors who surrender in Nanjing, Shanghai, and other places are all called "自投" (self-surrender). If a traitor whose name is not included in the list of traitors surrenders himself, the sentence may be reduced depending on the circumstances. The first provision in yesterday's proclamation by the Northeast Headquarters, "Traitors who should be arrested according to the Regulations on Punishing Traitors are encouraged to arouse their conscience, obey the national law, and surrender as soon as possible," is intended to encourage traitors who have not yet been arrested to surrender themselves as soon as possible so that they may receive leniency and a reduced sentence depending on the circumstances. When asked how many traitors have been arrested so far and whether the entire list can be published, it was said that the exact number is not yet known, but it is probably between 200 and 300. It can only be published after investigation and interrogation. It was also learned from the Hebei High Court that it has not yet received any cases of traitors transferred from various parties or cases of traitors who surrendered themselves. The traitors who have already been arrested, in addition to Wang Yintai, Wang Kemin, Wang Yitang, Wen Yuanzhang, Wang Shijing, Xu Xiuzhi, Liu Yushu, Zhou Dawen, and Guan Yixian, also include Yu Jinhe (pseudo-Mayor of Beijing, Director-General of the North China Cooperative Enterprise Association, Construction Director-General), Tao Shangming, Yin Rugeng (former member of the pseudo-Economic Committee), Pan Yugui (pseudo-Mayor of Tianjin), Du Xijun (pseudo-Superintendent of the Public Security Headquarters), Zhang Yanqing (pseudo-Vice President of the Xinmin Society), Leng Jiaji (pseudo-Chairman of the North China Communist Suppression Committee, member of the North China Political Affairs Committee), Cao Rulin (Chairman of several enemy-puppet economic, financial, and industrial institutions), Huang Nanpeng (pseudo-North China Gendarmerie Commander, Principal of the Gendarmerie School), Zhang Bi (head of the pseudo-Anqing Gang, who led plainclothes bandits to attack Zhang Zizhong's security team in Tianjin after the July 7th Incident), Rong Zhen (pseudo-Governor of Hebei Province), Zheng Xianzhen (pseudo-Secretary-General of the Beijing Municipal Government), Tang Yangdu (pseudo-Governor of Shandong Province, Director-General of the Public Works Administration), Hao Peng (pseudo-Administrative Commissioner of the Suhuai Special Zone), Wu Qiuchen (pseudo-Minister of Organization of the Xinmin Society), Qian Zongchao (pseudo-Director of the Police Administration Bureau of the North China Political Affairs Committee), Zhang Erkang (pseudo-President of the Normal University), Hong Weiguo, Yu Xijie (pseudo-Vice President of the Xinmin Society), Zou Quansun (pseudo-Member of the North China Political Affairs Committee, President of the Beijing Chamber of Commerce, Vice Chairman of the Enemy North China Trade Distribution Control Association), Chen Cengshi (pseudo-Director-General of the Ministry of Industry), Zhang Zhongzhi (pseudo-Deputy Director of the General Affairs Office of the North China Political Council), Zhou Zuoren (pseudo-Director-General of the North China Education Administration), Shu Zhuanghuai (pseudo-Director of the Beijing Municipal Public Works Bureau), Wu Zhen (pseudo-Director-General of the Ministry of Internal Affairs), Chi Zongmo (pseudo-Chairman of the Labor Association, a pseudo-organization that forced laborers on behalf of the Japanese), Liu Zongji (pseudo-Director of the Beijing Municipal Social Affairs Bureau), Liu Zongyi (pseudo-Secretary-General of the Beijing Municipal Government), Cheng Xixian (pseudo-Director-General of the Anti-Smoking Bureau), You Bolu, Cui Jianchu (pseudo-Director of the Beijing Municipal Police Bureau), and others.

[Central News Agency, Tianjin, 9th] Traitors arrested in Tianjin are being detained in three locations. All those on the list handed down by the Central Government who are in Tianjin have been arrested. However, those who are reported by the people and found to have solid evidence will still be arrested. When the authorities arrested the traitors, they sealed up their property and set up an agency to be responsible for clearing it. Anyone who conceals the property of traitors will be punished the same as traitors. Among the traitors who have been arrested in Tianjin, in addition to the leaders of the pseudo-organizations, there are many henchmen of the enemy army. The list includes Qi Xieyuan, Qin Hua, and several others.

### Key to World Peace: Huddle States Strengthening Sino-American Relations; U.S. Government Has Not Yet Instructed Marshall

[Associated Press, Chicago, 8th] Senator Huddle declared today at the Republican Executive Committee: World peace depends on the United States strengthening its relations with China. China is currently friendly to the United States, and this kind of relationship should be maintained. A slight mistake will inevitably seriously damage Sino-American relations. [Central News Agency, Washington, 7th, Associated Press] U.S. Secretary of State Byrnes declared at the Senate Foreign Relations Committee: The U.S. government has not yet given Marshall any instructions regarding China policy. The postponement of Marshall's meeting with Byrnes is due to Marshall's attendance at the Pearl Harbor Investigation Committee to testify. Byrnes said that after the testimony is completed, the two will hold a meeting and send the memorandum of the meeting to Marshall.

[Associated Press, Washington, 8th] Former U.S. Army Chief of Staff Marshall declared today at the Committee Investigating the Pearl Harbor Massacre that if the United States had 100 four-engine bombers in the Philippines, Japan would not dare to act toward the South China Sea, let alone covet the Philippines.

### Former U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Acheson Once Suggested Lending Materials to the Communists

Acheson Attends Meeting Today to Defend Himself

[Our Newspaper Sound Recording] Washington, 9th dispatch, U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Acheson will attend the Senate Foreign Relations Committee meeting tomorrow to respond to Hurley's remarks. It is reported that Hurley once accused Acheson of being a diplomat who undermined U.S. foreign policy. Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Connally announced that Hurley's accusations have already collapsed of their own weight. Connally continued, saying that Secretary of State Byrnes' response to Hurley has confirmed his own opinion that there is no need to further investigate State Department personnel. However, Acheson should have the opportunity to defend himself.

[Central News Agency Washington 7th, United Press dispatch] Byrnes, when attending a Senate Foreign Relations Committee report, did not mention Iran. Senator Vandenberg inquired whether Deputy Secretary of State Acheson had undermined U.S. policy in Iran. Byrnes replied that he first learned about the undermining of his Iran policy from news reports about Hurley's report on the 6th. Hurley also attended the Foreign Relations Committee meeting, stating, "Byrnes is evading the main issue. He did not answer the question I raised, namely, that Acheson had suggested lending materials to the Chinese Communist Party." Hurley also stated that his own memory of his meeting with Byrnes did not match the Secretary of State's memory. He had asked Byrnes to release the documents discussed, but Byrnes refused. Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Connally asked Byrnes whether he would approve the release of Acheson's memorandum. Byrnes replied that he was willing to submit everything to the Foreign Relations Committee but was unwilling to make it public. Connally then ended the meeting, stating that the Foreign Relations Committee would hold a closed meeting on the 8th to discuss the documents submitted by the State Department.

### Our Newspaper London Correspondence – Notes on the UNESCO Conference (Part 1)

— Yu Feng

The Foreign Ministers' meeting in London ended unhappily, and the future of peace is not entirely smooth. However, these numerous thorns cannot discourage those with foresight who seek human happiness. It takes a hundred years to cultivate people. International understanding should start with cultural exchange, and the foundation of peace should be in education.

Embracing this shared ideal, prominent figures in education and culture from thirty-nine countries traveled great distances to London, preparing to contribute their wisdom and sow the seeds of lasting peace.

The American delegation was a large contingent of thirty-two people, including representatives, consultants, technical secretaries, secretaries, assistant secretaries, and those in charge of administrative matters. The French delegation, although smaller than the American delegation, was led by the leader of the Socialist Party, Léon Blum himself. He had been imprisoned by the Germans for a full five years and was making his first appearance at an international conference since his release. It is said that the radical party leader Édouard Herriot was originally supposed to be the chief representative, but when the radical party's seats in parliament plummeted to nineteen in the general election, he did not attend. Both England and France are inviting countries, so Blum is an Associate President.

The president of the conference is the British Minister of Education, Miss Wilkinson, a pillar of the British Labor Party, as famous as Professor Laski. On the eve of the meeting, her name appeared in the headlines of British newspapers, not because she was going to chair the meeting, but because she gave a speech in her hometown, claiming that if the dockworkers' strike did not stop this winter, there might be a dangerous rationing of bread. This speech caused a stir in London and was discussed in Parliament. Members of Parliament expressed great dissatisfaction with Miss Wilkinson's alarmist remarks. Miss Wilkinson bravely admitted her mistake, saying that she was not the Minister of Food, but just making a casual prediction and would be more careful in her future statements. After pleading not guilty in Parliament, she came to the UNESCO conference to serve as president.

Guatemala, Luxembourg, Norway, Poland, South Africa, the United Kingdom, and Yugoslavia all had their Ministers of Education as their chief representatives. News came from home that Minister Zhu was supposed to attend in person. Upon hearing this, Oxford University prepared to award Minister Zhu an honorary doctorate, an honor given only twice a year. However, Minister Zhu set off from Chongqing, arriving in Nanjing instead of London. The honorary doctorate from Oxford University must be accepted in person. Since the recipient was not present, Oxford University had to regretfully withdraw the prepared honor.

Acting Chief Representative Dr. Hu Shih had already gained international fame. His speech made everyone feel that his reputation was well-deserved, and everyone praised him. On the day he spoke, a female representative from India also gave a speech, which also won applause from the whole audience. Everyone agreed that it was Asia's most glorious day.

The original intention of the conference's discussion was to use the draft of the Ministers of Education conference held in London as the basis. Later, because France also put forward a draft and other countries also had opinions, they were discussed together.

When the League of Nations was first established, the League of Nations' Committee on Intellectual Cooperation organized an International Institute of Intellectual Cooperation, located in Paris. The French representatives originally advocated using this institute as the secretariat for the future international education and cultural organization, with the director of the institute as the secretary-general, meaning to preserve this organization. The representatives of the participating countries were largely not in favor of this. Blum, aware of this, did not mention this point during his opening speech, only hoping that the future international education and cultural organization could be located in Paris. The British side had probably already agreed to this proposal, and the United States had no objection. It looks like the proposal to locate the headquarters in Paris can be expected to pass.

It is said that there were some disputes between the United States and France during the preparatory meeting before the cultural education conference, but the atmosphere was unusually harmonious during the conference, perhaps due to the evolution of the international situation. The Soviet Union did not participate or send anyone to attend, which was disappointing to everyone. In informal conversations at the venue, everyone expressed great regret about this.

Regarding the name of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, the United States proposed adding the word "Science," and the Chinese representative strongly seconded the proposal. The subcommittee has already passed it, and with the atomic bomb attracting attention, scientific cooperation should indeed be emphasized.

The conference venue was the Institution of Civil Engineers in Britain, an empty hall with rows of benches, without any brilliant decorations for this conference, and no slogans such as "Cultural Cooperation." There were only a few boards on all sides, with the words "No Smoking." In front of the benches, there were small signs with the names of the countries arranged in ABCD order, specially set up for the conference. Only these small wooden boards. The Chinese representatives sat in the first row, next to the Chilean representative, who was only one person.

The official documents of the conference were in English, French, Chinese, and Russian. During the meeting, English and French were given equal importance. Anything spoken in English or French was not translated. If a language other than English or French was spoken, it was translated into English and then into French. Next to the chairman, one translator translated into English, and the other translated into French. Reports at the conference were given in both English and French.

The conference secretariat took care of everything. When the representatives came to the meeting, they had problems with food and clothing. Regarding food, the secretariat had already obtained a food rationing book for each of them, which could be used for three weeks. Regarding clothing, they had not yet received the "points" required to buy clothes. There was a shortage of labor in London, and laundromats took two weeks to return clothes. Representatives who brought few shirts were already experiencing a shirt shortage. The problem of world education and cultural cooperation was giving them headaches, but what was currently giving them even more headaches was the shirt problem. (London, November 9th)

### The Moscow Three-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference – A Prelude to Further Cooperation – Seeking Practical Solutions to Major Current Issues – London Says A Five-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference Will Follow

[United Press London 8th dispatch] The Three-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference, to be held in Moscow next Saturday, is generally believed here to have been convened at the request of British Foreign Secretary Bevin. Bevin once described the meeting as a conference to declare the highest demands of each country, in which each country is bound to lay its cards on the table. With the support of U.S. Secretary of State Byrnes, Bevin will demand that Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov declare the Soviet Union's goals in Eastern Europe, the Mediterranean, Iran, and the Pacific. In return for the Soviet Union's frank declaration of its goals, the secrets of the atomic bomb will be made public. Prior to the Washington conference between U.S. President Truman and British Prime Minister Attlee, British spokesmen had stated that unless the Soviet authorities declared their foreign intentions, the secrets of the atomic bomb would not be disclosed to the Soviet Union. This truly subtle atomic matter will become the centerpiece of the "international poker game" of Bevin, Byrnes, and Molotov, reuniting after the breakdown of the London conference. It is reported that Byrnes is accompanied by several atomic experts on this trip to Moscow, including Brigadier General Leslie Groves, who is in charge of atomic bomb improvements, and Dr. Vannevar Bush, a famous American atomic expert. During this Three-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference, Molotov will make persistent inquiries, as the Soviet Union has long expressed dissatisfaction with the control of the Pacific. Therefore, there should be sufficient claims in the case of joint control of Japan.

It is predicted that after the conclusion of the Moscow conference, a Five-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference will be held in succession. This Foreign Ministers' Conference will include Dr. Wang Shijie of China and Mr. Bidault of France. British officials have not been able to confirm whether a Five-Power Conference will be held, but they firmly stated that the White House has a strong desire to convene a meeting of the Five-Power Foreign Ministers soon.

[Reuters London 9th dispatch] Our correspondent in Moscow reported that the news that the Three-Power Foreign Ministers will hold a meeting in Moscow is welcomed here as concrete evidence of Three-Power cooperation. The discussion of the atomic issue is particularly gratifying. It is generally expected that after continued frank discussions, satisfactory results can be obtained on several major issues. U.S. Secretary of State Byrnes informed the Chinese and French ambassadors to the United States that the Three-Power Conference will not reduce the authority of the Five-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference. The convening of this Three-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference is based on the decision of the Yalta Conference, as a partial resolution among the Three Powers.

Wide Range of Discussion

[Central News Agency New York 9th dispatch] This Three-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference will be a preliminary step in dispelling mutual suspicion among the major Allied countries. It is reported that in addition to the atomic bomb and control of Japan, the following issues will also be discussed at the upcoming Three-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference: (1) The issue of unified control of Germany. (2) A plan for a peace conference to finally resolve territorial disputes and war reparations. (3) The resolution of political issues. (4) The issue of Soviet ships freely passing through the Dardanelles Strait. (5) The issue of the withdrawal of troops from Iran by the three countries. (6) The Soviet Union's participation in the Control Council for Japan. (7) Resolving the situation in Korea. It is expected that the above issues will be consulted and coordinated in all aspects. General observation suggests that the conference may reach a final agreement, as it was initially initiated by U.S. Secretary of State Byrnes, and the Soviet Union immediately expressed its approval, which is powerful proof.

France Declares its Position

[Reuters Paris 9th dispatch] General de Gaulle's office issued a statement yesterday stating that if the upcoming Moscow conference only discusses the atomic bomb issue and does not involve France, France does not intend to protest, even though it has not been invited to participate. However, if issues of interest to France are discussed without seeking French opinion, France will not be bound by the agreement of the conference and will protest.

Before Hitler attacked the Soviet Union, he had set out to England several times, but each time he turned back due to bad weather. Before the trip, he had left a letter to Hitler, saying that he had decided to go his own way, even if he was called crazy by the Führer.

### Wartime Atrocities of Japanese in Tianjin – Destroying Chinese Education

[Dahua News Agency Tianjin News] During the War of Resistance Against Japan, the Japanese in Tianjin implemented an educational policy of "the less reading the better" to destroy the knowledge of Chinese youth. According to Huo Minghe, the principal of the private Beixian Elementary School, and Liu Baizhang, the principal of the attached elementary school of the municipal teachers' college, students did not attend class regularly. They were only used to deliver goods for the Japanese army or sweep snow off the roads. If they had free time, they would participate in parades or Japanese memorial services. Middle school students, in addition to participating in the same activities, were also forced to work in factories or Japanese air bases. As for the private Yaohua Middle School, which was in the former British Concession, it had more than a thousand students before the war. After the Japanese occupied Tianjin, public and private schools could not withstand the pressure, and students transferred to the Chinese interior. The principal of the school, Zhao Tianlin, was able to encourage students with a patriotic consciousness, and therefore incurred the resentment of the Japanese army, who martyred him at the school gate on June 20, 1938. It can be seen that the Japanese educational policy was to eliminate all patriotic educators in China.

### Editorial: Problems Caused by the Industrial and Commercial Registration Office

In recent days, it has been heard that Shanghai's industrial and commercial firms have raised many concerns due to the municipal government's mandatory industrial and commercial registration, and accountants are also making appeals. In fact, factory registration should have been carried out in accordance with the Factory Law, and the central competent department in charge of industry and commerce can entrust local governments to carry it out. As for commercial registration, the central government also has regulations, and the city had conducted it in accordance with the law before the war. This re-implementation is commonplace among merchants. As long as the methods are reasonable and the procedures are simple, it may not be considered too difficult. What needs special attention is the following issues in terms of time, procedures, and expenses.

(1) Time Issue: The Bureau of Social Affairs announced at the end of last month, designating areas and setting a deadline of the 5th of this month to collect forms and the 10th of this month to fill them out according to the prescribed format, with each stage set for five days. The business community may find this too hasty. Because the object of commercial registration is sole proprietorships and partnerships, and companies are not included, with small-scale businesses and handicraft workshops being the majority. They have few personnel, relatively shallow knowledge, and often do not read newspapers regularly. Assuming that their manager is away due to an accident, how should they fill out the forms? Their partners or family members may find it difficult to cope. Therefore, there is a legitimate reason to advocate for an appropriate extension to reduce difficulties. If commercial registration is still of a voluntary nature in accordance with central laws and regulations, then the deadline may not be a major obstacle, because registration or not is at their own discretion. Otherwise, if it becomes mandatory, and businesses must stop operating if they do not register, then the deadline should be extended even further. However, why the authorities have set such a short deadline has not yet been explained. It is speculated that since it is being held in stages and districts, given the size of Shanghai and the prosperity of its commerce, if each stage is delayed too much, it may affect the completion of the entire work. Although this is a speculation, it does not seem far from the truth. However, in order to fully understand the commercial situation, we still hope that an appropriate extension can be granted.

(2) Problem of Agency by Trade Associations: Because the deadline is too short, people collecting forms have experienced the pain of queuing and waiting. Therefore, some trade associations have volunteered. They plan to advance funds from the trade association, collect the forms in batches, and then distribute them to their peers to fill them out separately. This is naturally a good intention and cooperation. If the purpose of this industrial and commercial registration is not for the protection of rights, but rather for the authorities to obtain investigation and statistical materials, then the method of agency by trade associations can be accepted. Because doing so can reduce the trouble for businesses, reduce the procedures for government offices, and increase the connection and trust of the industry in the trade association, and there is no violation of laws and regulations. What a good thing that achieves several benefits, so why not do it?

(3) Problem of Consolidated Filling Out: Furthermore, having the trade associations consolidate and submit the forms on behalf of businesses should be no problem for the registrants, and the Bureau of Social Affairs may also be willing to accept it. Because individual receipt and consolidated receipt should not make much of a difference in terms of procedures.

(4) Payment Problem: The registration fees paid for industrial and commercial registration must be paid into the municipal treasury in accordance with the law, and unified collection and disbursement must be implemented. The Bureau cannot collect and remit the fees on behalf of the treasury. It is said that the responsible authorities have made the greatest efforts to address this issue. Initially, they hoped to achieve collection and remittance on behalf of the treasury to avoid the pain of merchants traveling back and forth, but this was not possible due to regulations. Unable to do so, they considered the next best thing, which was to request the municipal treasury to send personnel to the Bureau to collect the fees nearby. This can be considered benevolent and exhaustive. This method does not violate the principle of unified collection and disbursement, and it can save merchants many detours and troubles. Perhaps this is always possible in reality. Then, the matter of consolidated submission and payment also seems to be something that can be considered incidentally.

(5) Fee Problem: This problem is quite serious. The current method is indeed much higher than the old regulations and is a progressive system. So there are various discussions and appeals from the business community, hoping that the authorities will consider reducing the fees to alleviate the distress of businesses. Speaking from a business perspective, this is a reasonable and justifiable move. In all fairness, prices are now high and currency values are low, so it would be inappropriate to measure them using the old regulations. Moreover, the company registration regulations also adopt a progressive system for registration fees, and the authorities' current regulations are not without basis. However, since the war, the country has been scarred and business is declining. The purpose of registration is not to generate income, so if the authorities can be considerate and reduce the fees appropriately, it would not be a bad policy.

(6) Problem of Filling Out the Amount of Capital: This newspaper has already published a special article on this issue. Because the Municipal Chamber of Commerce has not received instructions from the Ministry and the registration of industrial and commercial businesses here is subject to a deadline, they were forced to convene standing committee members from various industries and decided on a hypothetical method. In terms of weighing the situation and considering the principles, it can be said that they have put in a lot of effort. However, cautious people still have two concerns. First, providing false information is subject to punishment according to regulations. Second, the amount of capital is related to taxation, and too much or too little will cause obstacles. Therefore, some people are still observing. In this special time, solving this special dispute is really not a perfect solution. We can only hope that the competent authorities in charge of industry and commerce and the tax authorities will consider both the law and the sentiment, maintain a broad approach, and not be too strict.

In summary, since the victory, the Central Government has repeatedly announced to the people that it will rest and recuperate, share weal and woe with the people, and especially instructed the recovered areas to "recover the hearts of the people." This is nothing more than to give the people who have survived the disaster an opportunity to recover. Therefore, when conducting industrial and commercial registration, we hope that the government can take into account the difficulties of businesses and grant the greatest tolerance in all aspects, whether it is the time, the procedures, or the fees, that can facilitate the business community and reduce the suffering of business people. This is true in Shanghai, and it is also true in the interior. At the same time, we also hope that business people will strictly abide by the laws and regulations, fill out the forms truthfully, and not hesitate or wait, delaying this work that the people and the government should cooperate on.

### Strengthening Transportation on Various Routes in Central China: New American Locomotives Arrive in Shanghai: A Total of Twenty Shipped from the Persian Gulf: To Be Unloaded at Shanghai Docks Within a Month

[Special Report from This Newspaper] Twenty of the latest American train locomotives have been shipped to China by the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) and will arrive in Shanghai soon. After these locomotives arrive in Shanghai, they will be allocated to the Central China Railway to strengthen transportation capacity.

Chen Bozhuang Talks

According to Chen Bozhuang, the person in charge of the Central China Railway Administration Committee, speaking to a reporter from this newspaper: The current difficulty in railway transportation lies in the insufficient allocation of locomotives. During the Japanese occupation, most of the locomotives were damaged due to overuse and poor maintenance. Of the locomotives received by the committee, nineteen need to be repaired, but due to the current shortage of materials, the repair work cannot be promoted. As a result, the actual allocation of usable locomotives is extremely difficult. Therefore, railway transport in central China today has fallen into a situation where there are cars without locomotives, and locomotives without coal. The locomotives recently shipped from the United States will be allocated to various railways to remedy the current urgent need.

Equipped with Cranes

According to the American Navy's "Abaton" ship, which is equipped with the largest ship-borne crane in the U.S. Navy, it will begin unloading twenty locomotives shipped from the U.S. at the local docks within a month. These locomotives are currently being loaded onto freighters from the Persian Gulf to Shanghai, each weighing ninety tons. The lifting capacity of the "Abaton" crane is 160 tons, so there should be no problem. The work is being undertaken by the Ministry of Transportation's Central China Railway Administration Committee, which will send two engineers to assist in handling the unloading.

### First American Liberty Ship Expected to Arrive Today

[Xinhua News Agency] According to Hu Shiyuan, Deputy General Manager of China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, the six American Liberty Ships that are about to arrive in Shanghai will sail directly here from Manila. According to telegrams, the departure date indicates that the first ship may arrive in Shanghai today. The reception ceremony will be held after all six ships have arrived.

### Foreign Newspapers Report Japanese Underground Activities in Shanghai

[U.S. News Office] According to a report yesterday from Lieberman, the New York Times correspondent in Shanghai: "Japanese underground activities in Shanghai are becoming busy due to lax supervision. Former Japanese secret agents and propagandists are currently residing in Hongkou as Japanese residents, gaining many opportunities to communicate with the Japanese prisoner of war camps under their own management. Although the Chinese authorities have stipulated measures for managing Japanese prisoners and residents, there is a lack of supervision at this time when the Japanese are waiting to be evacuated. In fact, the only liaison between Japanese prisoners and the outside world is mostly 50 liaisons who were formerly Japanese officers. They are all wearing civilian clothes and living outside the concentration camp. The 100,000 Japanese residents in Hongkou are currently managed by their own national organization. The Japanese prisoner of war camp here is not similar to any other institution of the same nature. I asked a Chinese military commander where the Chinese supervision was, and he replied, 'We have no guards. The act of guarding is not safe. There are too many Japanese.' Lieberman quoted General Tang Enbo as saying that apart from the remaining 5,000 Japanese soldiers in Shanghai who have not surrendered their weapons, the rest have surrendered. There are 900,000 Japanese residents in Shanghai and Nanjing, and only 2,000 have returned home. None of the imprisoned Japanese soldiers have been evacuated to Japan. Japanese residents wear white armbands, but it is easy to obtain permits to leave the concentrated area. Japanese residents are concentrated in family units and are managed by the former Japanese Consul-General. This includes three types: military, democrats, and a few communists, and conspiracies to compete for power are often heard. Among them, those who are large in the military faction oppose the propaganda of democracy."

He also went to Japan to participate in the "Greater East Asia Liberation Assembly" in the capacity of a representative of the Filipinos in Shanghai. At one point, Youai presided over the *Shanghai Times* under Japanese guidance.

### Authorities Regret the Case of Military Police Shooting and Killing a U.S. Soldier

[Report from This Newspaper] At around 3:00 AM on the 6th, Xu Alin, of 83 Pingliang Road, Pudong, was suddenly awakened by two drunken U.S. sailors knocking on his door, which led to a case of military police mistakenly killing a U.S. soldier. Reporters visited the independent 3rd Battalion of the Military Police yesterday and met with Deputy Battalion Commander Zhao, who reported that the circumstances had been reported to the 3rd Army and the headquarters of the Military Police, and the U.S. Naval Headquarters in Shanghai had been notified.

He enlisted in the Chengdu Training Corps. When the shot was fired, it was difficult to distinguish the nationality of foreigners in the dark. He first fired three warning shots, but the other party ignored them, so he had to use weapons. Afterwards, it was learned that the Allied forces had suffered this unfortunate incident, which was deeply regretted. As for the victims, Xu Alin and his wife, both suffered injuries to their left eyes and were sent to the police hospital for treatment. Two medical records have been sent to the U.S. Naval Headquarters.

In view of the fact that Shanghai is the center of gravity of the Executive Yuan's Relief and Rehabilitation Administration's business, and that the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration's (UNRRA) materials transported to China are mostly unloaded and distributed in Shanghai, the Administration has decided to establish an office in Shanghai to coordinate all of the Administration's national business. The office has now been formally established and is headed by Li Zhuomin, Deputy Director of the Administration, who is stationed in Shanghai. Deputy Director Li arrived in Shanghai on the 6th and began organizing the office. It is heard that most of the Administration's Storage and Transportation Department, Finance Department, Distribution Department, and Investigation and Translation Department will work in the Shanghai office. The heads of the departments have also come with Deputy Director Li, and the work is actively underway.

Also, Keyes, the director of the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration's China Branch, arrived in Shanghai on the 8th with 25 staff members from the Administration's Chongqing headquarters. He told reporters that Shanghai will be the central location for the UNRRA, and an office must also be set up in the capital for liaison purposes. It is also learned that in the Executive Yuan's Relief and Rehabilitation Administration's Shanghai office, in addition to the heads of the departments and staff, Liu Chongben will be appointed as the director of the Secretariat, and Nie Guangdi, a specialist committee member, will temporarily serve as the director of general affairs.

### Zhengzhong Bookstore Fire Destroys 30,000 Books

[Central News Agency Report] A fire broke out at 9:30 PM on the 8th at the Shanghai branch bookstore warehouse of Zhengzhong Bookstore, located at 167 Tiantong Road in this city. Firefighters extinguished the blaze. The location is a four-bay front and back building. During the war, it was the general office of the enemy Shanghai Bookstore Co., Ltd. After the victory of the war, when Zhengzhong Bookstore was ordered to take over its use on October 30th, the Hongkou Police Precinct dispatched police to accompany them. At that time, the police precinct had already determined that the contract had been broken. In addition to requesting the police precinct to investigate, the bookstore had separately reported to Special Commissioner Zhan of the Central Propaganda Department and the Shanghai Enemy and Puppet Property Handling Bureau for record. Subsequently, the location was used as a dormitory for Shanghai branch employees and a temporary bookstore warehouse. At 9:30 PM on the 8th, when a fire broke out in the middle of the rear building, the city fire brigade rushed to put it out. The fire was quickly extinguished, lasting a short time. Three rooms were burned, including four beds, and approximately 30,000 books of medium-level educational textbooks and reference books (estimated at approximately 3.5 million yuan based on wholesale prices), approximately 40 old textbook paper molds from before the war, and some daily necessities. The headquarters' book warehouse and paper warehouse are not located here, so the losses are relatively light. According to the fire brigade and police personnel who arrived on the scene the night before last, the ceiling and walls of the rear building were decorated with cardboard by the Japanese residents, which is extremely flammable, and the wiring was too old, so the possibility of an electrical fire is very high. After the incident, the bookstore has separately requested that the police precinct and the Enemy and Puppet Property Handling Bureau send personnel to the scene to investigate the area.

### French Consul General Philippe Baudet Visits Diao Zuoqian

### Zhongzheng Road to be Developed into a Tree-Lined Avenue, Planting Plane Trees on Both Sides

The Municipal Public Works Bureau has decided to develop Zhongzheng Road into a tree-lined avenue, and plans to start a trial run on the section from the Bund to Xizang Road. Yesterday, the bureau began transplanting trees between the fast and slow lanes to divide them and enhance the appearance. Prior to this, workers were instructed to dig pits and excavate mud along the line, because Zhongzheng East Road (formerly Edward Road) was formed by filling in a creek with garbage, resulting in poor soil quality, which made it difficult for trees to grow. In recent years, many have died, and very few trees remain. This time, the holes will be filled with four feet of yellow mud to facilitate the growth of the trees. It is also planned to plant French plane trees on the sidewalks on both sides of Zhongzheng East Road, and construction will begin soon.

### Theft of Copper Pipes and Scrap Iron, Arresting Perpetrators for Investigation

After the surrender of the enemy, the factory was sealed off by the Zhabei Precinct. However, it was discovered that a large amount of scrap iron stored in the factory had been stolen. Recently, nine thieves, including Zhou Rongsheng, have been arrested and sent to the local court for investigation.

### Social Services: Expedite the Raising of Relief Funds

— Yale

The main goal of running social service programs is, of course, to seek the welfare of the people. However, this task is vast in scope, and at the same time requires too many conditions. Given that the current political situation is not on track, it is conceivable that it will be difficult to achieve effective results. Therefore, as a last resort, starting with relief efforts should be a transitional approach. In fact, after eight years of war, the extent of suffering among the people has deepened even more than before, making relief extremely urgent. How can the vast unemployed masses be enabled to find work? How can the poor and sick receive medical treatment and medication? How can orphans without fathers or mothers receive education and care? How can the old and weak without support spend their remaining years? How can the disabled be accommodated? In addition, with the severe winter approaching, how can the distribution of clothing and porridge be implemented? These all fall within the scope of relief and should be handled promptly. We believe that although many of the tragic scenes in the world are due to "self-inflicted sins," the impact of the war is ultimately the main reason, and its severity is very widespread. Therefore, we estimate that the current relief work will require a very large amount of manpower and resources, which cannot be accomplished solely by the city's original charitable organizations. Rather, it must be actively promoted by influential people in society in order to achieve widespread results. At the same time, we believe that those people in Shanghai who have never suffered during the War of Resistance should think about how "lucky they are to have survived the hardships"! Then, what is it to contribute a little effort or donate a little money to the current relief efforts? In particular, those who stirred up trouble and made a fortune from the national crisis during the national crisis should now reflect on how they have violated their conscience too much and have let down the country and the people too much. Therefore, making the greatest effort for the relief efforts is the best opportunity to "atone for their sins." Only when the tragic scenes in society no longer exist can the people truly have welfare.

### Lu Xiaoman Who Lost Xu Zhimo

— Zhao Qingge

Every time I talk to friends about the issue of new poetry, we all invariably deeply regret the early death of the poet Xu Zhimo! Everyone knows that he was a giant star in the early stages of Chinese new poetry. His creations made the Chinese poetry scene radiate brilliant light, but his fall also caused the Chinese poetry scene to fade from that point on!

Out of grief for Mr. Zhimo, I cannot help but be concerned about Ms. Lu Xiaoman who lost Zhimo! Since Zhimo's passing, Ms. Xiaoman has never again written for the world. From this, one can imagine her general state of mind! Therefore, in Chongqing, I decided that I must visit her in Shanghai.

I wrote her a letter half a month ago, saying that I would go see her, and her reply also warmly hoped that I would go quickly. However, because I have not had time and have been in a restless mood, it has been impossible to talk about visiting her.

Today is the best day. Although it is cold, the sun came out in the afternoon. The cold cleared my busy mind, and the sun aroused my interest in going out for a walk. So I put down my pen and decided to visit Ms. Lu Xiaoman, who may have already been forgotten by people.

Fuxu Road is especially desolate, with sparse traffic and few pedestrians. Only fallen leaves are scattered on the sidewalk, lonely and silent, almost soul-shattering. I couldn't help but quietly say: This is precisely the environment where a poet should live.

Upon arriving at the Lu residence, I knocked on the ring for a long time before a maid with a northern accent came out. I gave her my name card, explaining that I had come specially to visit Ms. Lu. She then led me into the first and second floor living room. The living room is quite large, with old-fashioned furnishings and a strong scholarly atmosphere. On a rectangular painting table, brushes, ink, and pigments were scattered in a disorganized manner. A landscape painting that had just been continued was spread out on the table. Later, I learned that this was Xiaoman's only pastime in Shanghai, day after day, year after year. The table was inlaid with a glass plate, under which was pressed a casual photograph of Mr. Zhimo. He was lying on a lawn, holding a cigarette in his hand, elegant and otherworldly, with a lifelike expression. We can imagine that even when Ms. Xiaoman is painting, she still needs Mr. Zhimo's portrait to accompany her and comfort her.

The four walls are full of paintings and calligraphy. A large portrait of Ms. Xiaoman in her youth hung on the left corner of the photograph. Directly opposite her on the center of the left wall hung a large portrait of a man. One can tell at a glance that this is our poet Xu Zhimo. With the person gone but the shadow remaining, it is impossible not to be filled with grief and respect!

After about the time it takes to smoke a cigarette, there were footsteps from upstairs, followed by Ms. Lu Xiaoman walking into the living room with a smile.

Although she was wearing a very thick black sheepskin robe, it still couldn't hide her frail figure. Her complexion was pale, and it was undeniable that she was suffering from anemia. She was not wearing any makeup, which shows her state of mind, but she was still beautiful, like a secluded orchid, quietly and transcendently hidden in a deep valley.

"I've been waiting for you for so long and you haven't come. I thought my letter hadn't been delivered," she said warmly, holding my hand.

"I'm very sorry, I was busy and dragged it out until now to see you," I really felt apologetic at this moment. I regretted not coming sooner.

"Have you been feeling better lately?"

"Oh, no! I'm sick almost all year round. I couldn't even get out of bed a few days ago, otherwise I would have come to see you sooner!"

After she said this, she sat down beside me. At this moment, I noticed that she had a pair of eyes full of melancholy. She seemed afraid to see the light, and she often avoided places where the sun reflected.

"I haven't stepped out of the door for many years, and it can also be said that I haven't seen the sun for many years."

She understood that I was paying attention to her overly sad expression, so she quickly explained herself: She felt that human feelings and the world had become too ruthless in recent years. The sun was originally supposed to shine as a mirror of kindness and sincerity. Since it has lost this function, then its radiance is crippled. Therefore, she would rather let darkness and cold surround her, so that she gradually becomes numb through habit. Apart from her small building, which is her world, everything outside the small building is irrelevant to her, and she doesn't bother to ask about it.

But Ms. Lu cares about some of her old friends who are still in the mainland. She said:

"There are simply no friends in Shanghai, so I spend every day in absolute loneliness. I sleep in the morning, get up in the afternoon to read and paint, and at night I stay up all night with a lonely lamp, smoking, and spraying medicine; letting the smoke blur my entire mind."

Speaking of this, she suddenly asked about Mr. Wang Yunwu. She told me:

"I have no hope for anything. I only want to see the publication of the 'Complete Works of Zhimo' as soon as possible. This is the only thing I haven't been able to forget all these years. This is the only work I have done since Zhimo's death, but this matter is like a stone sinking into the sea. The book has not been published, and there is no news at all. Speaking of this, I will tell you a strange dream."

She began to excitedly narrate a pile of bitterness that had been lurking deep in her heart.

"When I started editing the 'Complete Works of Zhimo,' one night, I dreamed of Zhimo, clearly and distinctly. He was still as unrestrained and clever as when he was alive. I seemed to be looking at his manuscripts at the desk. He walked over from behind me, patted me and said, 'I am really grateful to you. You are working so hard to compile the complete works for me, but this is not a simple matter: you don't have to be too enthusiastic, especially don't have too much hope.' I didn't understand after hearing his words. I asked him, 'Why?' He smiled and said, 'When people are alive, feelings are alive. When people die, feelings die. The materials for the complete works are not complete, you must ask friends for help, and this will disappoint you. I can tell you: part of the diary will take three years of work; there is one novel that will never be possible; plus all kinds of other reasons, I am afraid it will not succeed until nine years later, if you don’t believe me, wait and see!' At that time, I really didn't believe it, so I didn't think much of it after waking up. I continued to work actively, until later, and even until now, I completely believed it. The facts are indeed correct. Zhimo was exceedingly intelligent when he was alive, and still exceedingly intelligent after his death!"

She paused, lit a cigarette, but didn't finish smoking it. The cigarette was trembling in her hand, and in the faint light of the cigarette, I could see her silently weeping.

"I have collected a lot of materials for the complete works by begging from east to west, but I am only missing three diaries and one translated novel. The diary is Zhimo's only unpublished work. After Zhimo's death, one of Zhimo's good friends borrowed the diary to read, but it took three years to return it to me. This is a confirmation of Zhimo's words. The novel was originally with Mr. Hu Shih, and later fell into the hands of Mr. Shen Congwen. After turning around like this, it was lost. Fortunately, I managed to gather the manuscript and asked to hand it over to the Commercial Press for publication. The agreement was made one year before the War of Resistance, and it has been eight years, and I don't know if it has been lost? Or does Mr. Wang Yunwu think that Zhimo is dead, and readers have long forgotten his name, so his works have no business sense and he is unwilling to publish them again? This is the second point that confirms Zhimo's words. Probably what he meant by 'other reasons' was the War of Resistance! His soul has a premonition. Due to the frustration of this matter, I understood the truth of the so-called: 'When people are alive, feelings are alive. When people die, feelings die.'"

She took a few hard puffs of the cigarette. I had been listening attentively to her words and watching her actions. My heart was filled with infinite distress and emotion!

"Zhimo has been dead for fourteen years," she uttered these tearful words, one word at a time, heavily. "The world has been without him for fourteen years, and it has destroyed me forever!"

She stopped speaking. At this moment, I could faintly hear her heart beating rapidly, and her breathing was a little unnatural.

I comforted her and said:

"The complete works must be published. If Mr. Wang Yunwu doesn't publish them, you can hand them over to another publisher. Even if the bookstore owner thinks it has faded its golden color, the Chinese literary scene regards it as precious. Mr. Zhimo will not be forgotten by people, and he will live forever in the memory of readers!"

I also advised her:

"Spring is coming soon, and everything will start anew. I hope you will also cheer up from now on. Staying in the house all the time is not good for your health. You should go out as much as possible, even go further, because traveling is also a good medicine for invigorating the spirit."

She accepted my opinion, and was very moved to promise me that she would start to walk out of her small building and come to my place, and then her old friends would arrive in Shanghai one after another, and she would run around everywhere again. In this way, I think it will not be difficult for her to regain her health, and it will not be difficult to recall her pleasant mood!

Fearing that she was too tired, I stood up to say goodbye. Walking out the door, it was already dusk. Stepping on a fallen leaf again, I walked back home, feeling heavier than when I came, and quietly blessing Ms. Lu Xiaoman, who had lost Mr. Xu Zhimo!

December 6, 1945, in Shanghai.

Bits of History from the Pen

### Friends

— Murong Sui

In these times, talking about friends really makes one feel nothing but "emptiness" and "bewilderment"! Children come home from school, jumping and shouting, sometimes singing "Good friends! Good friends, let's hold hands!" Yet, in a moment, they are arguing again. It truly annoys the elderly, but the only way to deal with it is to use "silence," ignoring them completely. Clearly, this is the elderly's wonderful method for dealing with all troubles.

Speaking of friends: "Friend, you should think things through more openly." Someone one rank above you will only use "rascal, son of a bitch" to teach you, their friend, a lesson. If you want "revenge," the only thing to do is use "rascal, son of a bitch" on a friend one rank below you. If there's no one below you, you can only go home and vent your anger on the group of snotty-nosed kids you support!

"Rascal!" What "account" is being "muddled?" Of course, these days everyone wants to "muddle along" with their friends. They only sell on "credit" everywhere. What is called friendship is just everyone "muddling along"!

Your "superior" scolds you; you then pass it on and scold your "inferior." This way everyone sells on "credit," and only then can they "muddle along." Take the snotty-nosed kids in your home, for example; they aren't wronged either. Who told them to be born without bringing banknotes? Taking a bite of rice and drinking a sip of porridge should be "accounted" for. Little friends: being able to "muddle" the "account" is already a bargain!

### Magnolia Flower Slow

— Gu Yiqiao

The surrender platform has been built, leaving the red leaves to fall desolately. I remember crossing the Bajiang River in the mist, wandering through the Three Temples, and the snow falling on the Tianshan Mountains. Climbing straight up Mount Sumeru on a camel's back, I watched the Yellow River flow out of Yumen Pass. Drifting as a guest on the Jialing River, tears wet my marching clothes for eight years! Looking at each other, our hair is white, and our faces are childlike. The tea is bitter and the plum is sour. Entrusting the clear wind of both places and the bright moon of one day, I cherish the frost and cold. In the severe winter, the weather is cold and the ground is frozen. I advise you to lie high in your green quilt and not turn over lightly. Just listen to the flowing clouds and flowing water, and the clear sounds that halt the dust of the mortal world.

Business News

### Weekly Review of Financial Business - Public Bonds Rise Alone, Commodity Prices Weaken

Finance: This week's financial situation in the city saw continued easing of credit. The daily interest rate of 1,000 yuan remained steady at 30 cents. The black market interest rate was threatened by the decline in commodity prices. Citizens favored currency over goods, and hoarders sold goods for cash, no longer borrowing for speculative purposes at high interest. The rate retreated from 13 cents to 10 cents, equivalent to 100 yuan per month for every 1,000 yuan. Spot gold initially reached a peak of 780,000 yuan, but then, due to optimism about the situation in North China and the Nine Provinces of the East, the impending start of international free trade, the establishment of Anglo-American loan agreements, and the reopening of foreign banks in Shanghai, sellers rushed in, and market prices gradually fell. On Friday, the low reached 763,000 yuan. Finally, because the gold price in Chongqing still stood at over 840,000 yuan, there was much arbitrage and profit-taking to cover short positions, causing it to rebound to 683,000 yuan at closing, still down 94,000 yuan from the previous week. Silver remained steady at 650 yuan. Silver coins rose from 420 yuan to 455 yuan because farmers in rural areas needed to exchange them for rice. U.S. dollars fell because foreign banks were reopening, foreign exchange would soon recover, and importers and exporters no longer needed to hoard U.S. dollars as collateral. Those holding goods became less interested, and the pressure on those arbitraging gold and U.S. dollars increased. At the end of the week, the low reached 1,060 yuan, and the final closing was 1,090 yuan, a sharp drop of 218 yuan from the previous week.

Securities: Since the CCP declared that it would not prevent the central government from taking over the Northeast, buyers of unified government bonds were excited, and there was even talk of a short squeeze on unified bonds. The price soared from 405 yuan to 610 yuan. Although it suddenly dropped to 540 yuan at closing due to profit-taking by bulls, it was still up 15 yuan from the previous week. Currently, those holding unified bonds have a fantasy that customs gold will be used to repay the principal and interest. Major stocks generally have a relationship with counterfeit currency increasing capital, which must be strictly reorganized and cannot be transferred. There is a severe shortage of new buyers, and both popular large and small stocks fell. Foreign stocks fell due to the hint of falling gold prices and the fact that foreign businesses would be subject to Chinese law after reopening. New buyers are taking a wait-and-see attitude. Ewo Cotton Mill shares fell 280 yuan to 1,400 yuan, and Jardine Matheson also retreated from 4,200 yuan to 3,500 yuan.

Goods: Regarding commodities, rice prices fell due to the arrival of Wuhu, inland, and Taiwanese rice. Furthermore, with the relocation of the Third Route Army, the security of the rice-producing areas around Taihu Lake improved, and households no longer blindly hoarded rice. The price gradually fell. On Thursday, thick japonica rice once fell to 6,000 yuan, and passenger indica rice even dropped to 5,000 yuan. Finally, because inland rice prices rose, it rebounded to 7,000 yuan (indica rice) to 8,000 yuan (japonica rice), still down 1,000 yuan from the previous week. Flour prices fell because large quantities of relief flour wheat were being shipped to Shanghai and would soon be sold publicly at reduced prices. Furthermore, rice was cheaper than flour, and the price of No. 1 flour, 49 pounds per bag, retreated from 3,300 yuan to 2,600 yuan. Edible oil shipments from Qingdao, Bengbu, and Changzhou continued to arrive, and hoarders sought to sell. After a low of 15,000 yuan was once discovered, it rebounded to 19,000 yuan due to purchases by consumers and local oil stores. Sugar prices rose because the customs' reduced selling price increased, and Taiwanese sugar could not be freely exported. The buying price of Xinghua white sugar rose from 48,000 yuan to 50,000 yuan, and No. 24 coarse granulated sugar even rose by 5,000 yuan to 60,000 yuan. Raw cotton prices dropped because American cotton was fixed at 24.45 cents. After the price of gold fell sharply with the U.S. dollar, the calculated price became cheaper, and Chinese cotton was greatly affected. Tongzhou American-type cotton fell sharply from 70,000 yuan to 55,000 yuan. Pudong Huoji flower fell to 30,000 yuan, and Zhoupu seed flower sold for only 5,000 yuan, down 2,000 yuan from the previous week. Cotton yarn saw slightly more sales in the Yangtze River area, but it lacked support due to the daily decline in raw cotton prices, falling from 80,000 yuan to 480,000 yuan from the previous week. Morale was weak, there were labor strikes in silk factories, and silk mills had very sluggish demand. High-grade factories had already fallen into the 1 million yuan range, and raw silk only cost 410,000 yuan. 120-count artificial silk Tianqiao fell sharply by 200,000 yuan, suddenly seeing a new low of 380,000 yuan since late October. Fuel deliveries arrived continuously by land and water. The price of white coal fell from 330,000 yuan per ton to 270,000 yuan, but the retail price did not ease. In short, all commodity prices were in a state of large decline with small rebounds. (Chongbo)

### Why Is Type C the Only One Rising?

Recently, commodity prices in this city have generally been declining, but only public bonds have been soaring. Although it is said to be stimulated by rumors such as the reorganization of the new currency and the repayment of silver dollars, the unified government bonds are the same. Why is the value of Type A only half that of Type C? Isn't the capital being repaid by lottery in Chongqing! After switching to using the legal tender to bid, it has been crazily raised to more than five times the face value. Although it is said to be supporting national credit, on the other hand, it is suppressing the credit of the legal tender. If you want to pursue the reason for its rise, what is the basis? I think it would be simpler to talk about the transaction method of public bond trading.

Currently, there is no formal legal venue for public bond trading. The number of firms engaged in public bond trading is only about 30. They usually gather in the corridor on the seventh floor of the stock exchange and adopt a spot delivery system. However, the goods delivered by the seller must be attached with interest coupons for the year 1942. At the same time, tickets with a face value of less than 1,000 yuan or slightly damaged are rejected. It is estimated that the total number of transactions per day is only about 10 million yuan in face value, of which more than half are Type C, more than 30% are Type E, and Types A, B, and D account for less than 20%. The most familiar type, Type C, is worth about 30 million legal tender at a price of 600 yuan. Only about 40 gold bars are needed to manipulate the entire bond market. Moreover, Shanghai has plenty of crazy retail investors. Most of the public bonds held by the financial sector were moved west after the enemy occupied the concession. Therefore, the demand for public bonds with interest coupons for the year 1942 is actually very limited, not to mention the various picky requirements.

Since there are the above-mentioned restrictions on public bond trading and delivery, if an outsider rashly goes short based on economic theory, then at 3:00 PM (closing time), under the manipulation and monopoly of those in the industry, they will be squeezed to the point of suffocation. Unless the authorities set a deadline for claiming the public bond interest coupons left behind in the occupied areas, they will continue to treasure them like jade. Then, what does the current price of five times mean? (Jingzhi)

### Book Value of Capital and Tax Revenue

— Xiaohui

Whether the book value of capital is converted from counterfeit currency to legal tender at a rate of 200 to 1 or 2 to 1, it is only a matter of reducing a few "zeros" in the books. As far as the enterprise itself is concerned: assets are assets, and the book value is the book value. The increase or decrease in the book value will not affect the increase or decrease in assets. Therefore, the proportion of rights that shareholders can claim against the company will always be the same, no matter how the conversion is done.

The government's order to convert counterfeit currency to legal tender at a rate of 200 to 1 in consideration of the people in the occupied areas is purely about the currency. There is no clear order on how the book value of capital should be converted. Therefore, the saying that "the book value of capital should be converted at a rate of 200 to 1" is inferred from the above order and is not a mandatory regulation. Therefore, while it cannot be said that 200 to 1 has no basis, there is absolutely no violation of laws or regulations in 2 to 1 or even 1 to 1.

However, the analysis and combination of the book value of capital is greatly related to the book value of profits. This is because the prices of goods calculated in counterfeit currency are not in the same ratio as the prices of goods calculated in legal tender. The levy of income tax and profit tax is based on the ratio of profits to capital, which determines the rate of levy. Therefore, if the book value of capital must be converted at a rate of 200 to 1, then what store has no inventory? What goods are not above the 200 to 1 ratio? So, at the end of the year, what account will not be dazzling?

The increase in tax revenue is certainly of great benefit to the government's finances. However, this profit is ultimately fictitious. Whether it is affordable for the private industrial and commercial sectors after eight years of exploitation to use fictitious profits to pay real taxes, not to mention draining the pond to catch all the fish, the government, which intends to support the private economy, would not do this.

And suppose the government had completely ignored the counterfeit currency from the beginning, and the counterfeit currency had all become waste paper. Then, if we insist on confusing the currency with the book value of capital, shouldn't the current industrial and commercial capital be converted into a "zero" as well? When the current value of the company's assets is expressed in the books, should it all be treated as profit?

Therefore, the reorganization of the book value of capital cannot be generalized, and the conversion rate of currency cannot be used. The key lies in the issue of fictitious profits and real taxes. In today's situation of widespread decline in purchasing power and the inability of the industrial and commercial sectors to recover, I would like to offer the government the saying "it is better to nurture the source than to open up the source."

### Taiwanese Sugar Exchanged for Soybean Cake

Yu Baixi, general manager of the Taiwan Trading Company, told reporters that important export materials from Taiwan, such as sugar, rice, and coal, are under the centralized management of the Taiwan Administrative Governor's Office. The Taiwan Trading Company is a "business organization" directly under the jurisdiction of Governor Chen. Its only task is to handle the barter trade between Taiwan Province and the mainland. The first measure taken by the company after its establishment was to exchange the first batch of more than 1,000 dan of sugar shipped to Shanghai with 10,000 sheets of soybean cake from the group organization of more than 160 sugar merchants here, and transport them to Taiwan to alleviate the severe fertilizer panic currently facing the vast farmlands of Taiwan Province.
