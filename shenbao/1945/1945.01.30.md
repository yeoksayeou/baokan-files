### Mindanao Western Sea Area: Japanese Submarine Pursues and Attacks Enemy Ships; Four Enemy Ships Sunk in the Eastern Pacific

Philippine Japanese Military Base, 29th, Central News Agency: On the 24th, a Japanese submarine squadron pursued and attacked an enemy transport convoy off Mindanao, sinking two enemy transport ships and one unidentified type of enemy warship, each struck by torpedoes. Furthermore, a certain Japanese submarine, commanded by Japanese Lieutenant Sada Tanaka, discovered an enemy transport convoy in the western sea area of Mindanao at dusk. Braving heavy enemy guard, the submarine daringly launched a surprise attack, firing several torpedoes, causing a violent explosion on one enemy transport ship. Following the successful surprise attack, the enemy convoy was thrown into great disarray. Amidst this chaos, a certain submarine commanded by Japanese Lieutenant Commander Nakagawa and another commanded by Japanese Lieutenant Matsuda seized the opportunity to boldly attack the enemy convoy. Lieutenant Commander Nakagawa bombed an enemy vessel, identified as a seaplane tender, while Lieutenant Matsuda's submarine bombarded an enemy transport ship, both enemy ships being hit and destroyed. In this engagement, all Japanese forces returned to base unscathed.

Central Pacific Base, 29th, Central News Agency: Japanese submarines drove deep into the Eastern Pacific, disrupting the supply lines of the four bulwarks of the American mainland, sinking one American oil tanker and three transport ships.

### Luzon Island Battle Situation: Increasingly Fierce

Philippine Frontline, 28th, Central News Agency: In the third week of the enemy American invasion of Luzon Island, the battle situation is becoming increasingly fierce. The enemy has landed two additional divisions, bringing the total to seven divisions, including two tank divisions. With the cooperation of superior air power, they are attempting to advance. Approximately three enemy divisions are positioned along the northeastern highland line of Pangasinan, while the other two divisions are held in reserve. The two tank divisions, forming the main force, are forcibly breaking into the central plain of Luzon under the cover of air power. On the 26th, the enemy force, primarily tanks, numbering two hundred, reached the line around Clark Airfield, attempting to seize a portion of the airfield. The enemy's intention in breaking into Clark Airfield is to secure an air base for controlling Luzon Island, concentrating air force bases auxiliary to those in Leyte and Mindoro. However, the enemy's southward-moving troops have encountered fierce attacks from the Japanese army along the Clark Airfield line. With strong artillery positions, they have continuously bombarded enemy strongholds since the 26th, and with suicide attack squads and bayonet charges, they have thwarted the enemy's attempts. As of the 28th, the enemy had not completely captured Clark Airfield. Furthermore, small enemy units attempting to advance towards San Fernando were intercepted and stalled by Japanese forces in the southern highlands of Clark Airfield.

Philippine Ubi Base, 29th, Central News Agency: On the 25th, the Japanese Kamikaze Special Attack Force severely damaged an enemy battleship or large cruiser in Lingayen Gulf, Luzon Island.

Philippine Frontline Japanese Military More Base, 28th, Central News Agency: On the night of the 25th, Japanese air force units launched a fierce attack on the enemy fleet in Lingayen Gulf, Luzon Island, destroying one large transport ship and one destroyer.

### American Reporter Speculates on Japanese Military Strategy

Lisbon, 29th, Central News Agency: The landing enemy forces on Luzon Island, because the main Japanese forces have remained silent to this day, are finding it difficult to understand. A Washington reporter, observing the Japanese army's operational intentions, stated the following: The United States also knows that there has been no large-scale counteroffensive on Luzon Island, and therefore many are optimistic. However, if they were to learn that the Japanese headquarters is waiting for an opportunity to deploy a novel and ingenious defensive strategy, they would be extremely apprehensive. The Japanese army is currently appearing to lean towards decisive battles on the front lines. The Japanese army is waiting to move for the following two reasons: (1) The question of whether McArthur's forces will make new landings other than in Lingayen Gulf. If this is not clearly indicated, the Japanese army will not move its main forces. (2) In order to sweep across the American positions in one go, it is necessary to choose a favorable terrain for the decisive battle.

### Filipino Youth Join Assault Teams

Lingayen Front, 29th, Central News Agency: Filipino youth, in order to defend their homeland, organized the Patriotic Comrades Association last autumn, making it their duty to destroy the British and Americans. Some of its members, unable to sit idly by and watch the enemy Americans invade their territory, bravely devoted themselves to the battlefield, joined the Japanese assault teams, and attacked enemy positions in Lingayen Gulf, achieving great results.

### Japanese Forces Launch Fierce Assaults on the Burma Front; Finally Encircle British Forces in Lairam

Lisbon, 29th, Central News Agency: According to Reuters on the 27th: The situation of the Japanese army's heroic attacks on the Irrawaddy front is as follows: The recent battle near Chauk-Minhla, a crossing point on the Irrawaddy River, is a good example of the Japanese army's spirit of attack. The British-Indian forces on the Burma front are now facing the fiercest attacks the Japanese army has ever launched, with Japanese forces carrying out continuous night-time close-quarters assaults. A certain British-American major, amidst the Japanese rain of bullets, explained the operational situation by the banks of the Irrawaddy River. The Japanese army, after continuous artillery fire from 11:00 PM to 3:00 AM, launched an even fiercer assault, finally encircling the British forces in Lairam, the situation being extremely urgent, and subsisting on biscuits.

Lisbon, 29th, Central News Agency: According to a Chongqing dispatch, Chiang Kai-shek's American Commander of the China Theater, Wedemeyer, and the American Ambassador to Chongqing, Hurley, broadcast on the 28th, formally naming the former Burma Road as the Stilwell Road.

Burmese Monks Cooperate with Japanese Forces

Rangoon, 29th, Central News Agency: The British-Indian-Chongqing forces, attempting to retake Burma, launched a counteroffensive last year and have invaded northern Burma. Recently, a monk escaped from enemy-occupied territory, conveying the atrocities committed by the British-Indian-Chongqing forces against the Burmese people, which greatly angered the Burmese government and people. This monk is the abbot of a certain temple in Nam Ma, northwest of Myitkyina. Having survived a near-death experience, he came to Rangoon and recounted the following: The enemy troops are of mixed races and have poor discipline. Countless Burmese civilians have been massacred by them. They frequently break into Burmese residents' homes, and if there are fewer people, the entire family is killed. If a family member goes out, it must be reported immediately, and a slight delay will result in the entire family being killed. All men over the age of sixteen and under the age of forty are conscripted into service. All women, regardless of race, are taken away. It is impossible to survive in enemy-occupied territory. Many temples in Myitkyina have been bombed and destroyed. No building in the city streets and villages is intact. All shops are occupied by the enemy. The young people in the nearby villages are frequently conscripted into service. If they dare to escape, the enemy will use various means to deal with them. We do not want to be used by them, so we are here, willing to cooperate with the Japanese army to the end.

### Japanese Forces Select Elite Troops for Assault on Peleliu; Inflict Heavy Damage on Enemy Airfield

A certain Japanese Military Base in the Central Pacific, 29th, Central News Agency: Regarding the Japanese army's attacks against the enemy's airbase on Peleliu Island, which is being used as a base for air operations against the Philippines, the Japanese army had an attack force engage in close quarters combat against the enemy airfield in October. Recently, Lieutenant Hori Shigeo, after specially training an elite special attack force, landed near the enemy airfield on Peleliu Island and inflicted considerable damage after conducting a brave attack. Even the enemy forces openly admitted this, which shows the depth of the blow inflicted.

A certain Japanese Military Base in the Pacific, 28th, Central News Agency: The Japanese forces on Peleliu Island, with an indomitable fighting spirit, have been fighting bravely. At the end of last October, a special attack force under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Endo, responding from Palau Island, broke into Peleliu Island, inflicting significant damage on the enemy. Also, on the 17th of this month, a special attack force of several dozen men led by Lieutenant Hori Shigeo launched an attack from Palau Island, broke into the vicinity of the enemy airfield on Peleliu Island, and inflicted considerable damage. This special attack force was comprised of several dozen warriors chosen and trained by Lieutenant Colonel Endo.

### The Impregnable Burma Front

The United States, eager to invade the Philippines, is attempting to make the Chinese mainland a land base for attacks against Japan, and is working on two fronts: advancing operations from the sea towards the coast of the Chinese mainland, and transporting troops and supplies from the Ledo Road. As enemy General Wedemeyer said: "Island hopping cannot threaten Japan; China must be used as a base. The counteroffensive in Burma is a response to the Pacific operations. The war in China is America's own war." The enemy's counteroffensive operation in Burma is a part of the long Pacific and European operations. As the battle situation on these fronts intensifies, the Burma front naturally shows a tense situation. Since the rainy season last year, the Japanese army in Burma has already prepared its strategic posture to welcome the New Year of 1945 with an ironclad formation.

Japanese Army Takes the Initiative

In the northern Burma area, in late October of last year, the Yunnan Expeditionary Force, with the main force of the 11th Army Group, attempted to retake Longling and Mangshi, and began a general counteroffensive. The Japanese army immediately launched appropriate counterattacks to consume their combat power, gradually reducing their front and luring them into the trench warfare of Wanting and Namhkam. The Japanese garrison fought hard in the salient position of Bhamo for a month, precisely because it could intercept the American-Chongqing forces in Bhamo at the established positions of Wanting and Namhkam. Thanks to the fierce fighting of these advance units, the Japanese army was able to deploy properly on both sides of the Yunnan-Burma Highway. Along the Myitkyina railway line and near Imphal, solid front deployments were completed during the Japanese army's hard fighting. On the Nanchi front, when the Japanese army first used a detachment to contain the enemy forces along the Kaladan River and near the Arakan Mountains, it prepared a decisive battle posture. In short, the progress of the operations was entirely under the initiative of the Japanese army. On the front of the Japanese army's positions in Wanting and Namhkam, there were approximately six divisions of the 11th Army Group, one division of the 20th Army Group, and one division of the American-Chongqing forces, plus one division on the Mongmit front, totaling approximately nine divisions. In order to completely open the Ledo Road, they have begun a full-scale offensive, but the Japanese army is also increasing its forces and strongly repelling them.

Enemy Strength

The enemy forces north of the Moreh River are deploying four divisions in the first quadrant, attempting to invade the Shwebo Plain. The Japanese army, with the help of the air force, launched appropriate counterattacks, inflicting heavy losses. As for the coastal area, the enemy forces began to land carefully only after the Japanese army automatically reorganized the front. However, they are boasting loudly on the radio.

The battle situation in various places is very active, with tanks and air force cooperating to launch active offensives. Recently, enemy aircraft have been cooperating with ground troops to carry out bombing and strafing, dropping incendiary bombs in an attempt to burn down the Japanese army's positions, and frequently reconnoitering supply points and supply lines, adding to the strafing and bombing.

The enemy strength gathered on the border between China, India, and Burma is approximately 640,000. In addition, there are five divisions of the ground forces and one division of the marines in the amphibious operation, and five divisions of paratroopers, totaling 210,000. It is said that the army in India commanded by Auchinleck has reached 970,000. The enemy, with such a large force, intends to invade the coastal areas of Burma. In modern amphibious operations, airborne operations must be launched first, or carried out simultaneously. The situation on the Burma front is also the same. First, paratroopers are used to create bridgeheads, and then airborne troops are brought in.

Seizing the Initiative

As for the naval power that is the driving force behind the amphibious operation, it is the British Eastern Fleet, which is a mixed formation of the armies of Britain, France, Holland, and Italy. With the Japanese army's well-organized deployment already completed today, it will never easily allow the enemy to realize its intentions. In fact, the enemy's fighting is very cautious. For example, in the Nanchi area, after the Japanese garrison automatically withdrew, the enemy did not dare to advance hastily. From the beginning of the heavy bombing by aircraft and shelling by warships to the landing of British troops, it took as long as 24 days, and they cautiously attacked from all directions from a location 20 kilometers north of the Japanese base.

In their new operations, the enemy will thoroughly mobilize air power. They only dare to act when they make full use of air power and have sufficient ammunition and other resources to rely on. The Japanese army's tactic against this kind of warfare is to seize the initiative. That is, to defeat the enemy's initial actions before their operational preparations are completed and they are about to carry out a counteroffensive, and to crush their counteroffensive attempts. If the enemy wants to regroup and launch another counteroffensive, it will inevitably take a considerable amount of time, and the Japanese army will seize the initiative again when they plan to launch another counteroffensive, and give them a head-on blow. In the Myitkyina area, the Japanese army has blocked the superior enemy forces outside the key points of northern Burma for as long as a month.

Waiting for an Opportunity to Annihilate the Enemy

Because of the timely strategic deployment on the main roads, the Japanese army's supply and communication between the front and rear are worry-free. On the contrary, the enemy's supply lines are long and stretched, with many weaknesses. From their operational bases Myitkyina, Imphal, and Chittagong to their front lines, they stretch for 300 kilometers, and in between there are the dangerous mountains, dense forests, rivers, and swamps of the India-Burma border. Moreover, their main supply routes all originate from the operational bases, and there is only one route, especially in the Nanchi area, whether it is transportation or advancing troops, they must cross the Mayu mountain range, the Arakan mountain range, and countless small streams of the Mayu River from India.

Today, the enemy's actions are quite frequent on the front lines throughout Burma. The mountain warfare that was previously waged on the India-Burma border, once it enters the plains, will become a three-dimensional mobile war in which mechanized units take center stage, and the battle situation will become increasingly fierce. But this is all within the scope of operations that the Japanese army anticipated and discussed last September. The Japanese army in Burma is using new tactics, waiting for an opportunity to annihilate the arrogant enemy.

Editorial

### Discussion on Improving the Salaries of Civil Servants

Recently, the government authorities are practicing purging corruption in order to establish a clean government; and improving the treatment of civil servants in order to stabilize their lives. "Only when clothing and food are sufficient will people know honor and disgrace." Eating and wearing warmth are the premise of a clean government.

The new municipal administrator of this city, in order to eradicate chronic ills, has also recently considered improving the treatment of his subordinate officials, police, etc., and is actively calculating in order to achieve its realization in the shortest possible time. Improving the treatment of civil servants is generally not a problem; the question now is how to improve it.

The most basic principle is to provide civil servants with the necessities of life or their equivalents. There are three methods: (1) Pay salaries entirely in kind; (2) Pay for major necessities in kind, and then pay a certain amount of salary; (3) Pay for all living needs entirely in cash.

The first method is to calculate the amount of various necessities required by each employee each month, and distribute them separately, or convert the various necessities into cash first, and then distribute one or two or three kinds of necessities that are easier to distribute according to the converted amount of cash. For example, various necessities can be converted into a certain amount of cash, and a certain amount of cash can buy several dou of rice and several jin of flour, etc., and then several dou of rice or several jin of flour are distributed each month.

The second method is to distribute in kind a portion of particularly important necessities, such as rice, flour, coal briquettes, oil, etc., and then pay the rest in cash. For example, several dou of rice, several jin of flour, several dan of coal briquettes, several jin of oil, and a certain amount of cash are distributed each month.

The third method is not to distribute any goods, but to pay for all the necessary goods in cash according to their prices. However, if there are no ration coupons or no designated rationed goods that have been properly negotiated for purchase, the conversion standard should not be calculated using designated ration prices or price limits, but should be fairly priced according to general market prices. The price on the first or fifteenth day of each month should be used as the standard, such as in accordance with the price index officially adjusted by the official agency.

The above three methods can be used flexibly at any time. When goods are available, goods are distributed; when goods are difficult to collect, cash is paid. In short, the principle is to be able to obtain the necessary living goods. However, it seems more feasible to pay both goods and cash together. Therefore, it is best to adopt the second method and then use it flexibly. For example, several dou of rice and flour, etc. (or ration coupons), and a certain amount of cash can be issued each month, and it can still be adjusted according to the difficulty of purchasing goods.

As for the standard for issuing necessities, we believe that it is more reasonable to calculate according to a family of four to six people. For example, if we take a family of four with a husband, wife, and two children as the standard, and estimate according to general life, the monthly needs of a family of four are: five dou of rice (equivalent to the current market price of 20,000 yuan, ration price of 3,250 yuan)

Half a bag of flour (equivalent to the market price of 6,000 yuan, ration price of 3,600 yuan)

Three dan of firewood (equivalent to the market price of 15,000 yuan; coal briquettes are not easy to buy, and fuel is generally calculated as firewood)

Dishes and cooking supplies (24,000 yuan)

Rent, water, electricity, and donations (1,000 yuan)

Daily necessities such as soap (2,000 yuan)

Other expenses (about 10,000 yuan)

If the above rice and flour, etc., are calculated according to market prices, the total monthly living expenses are about 70,000 to 80,000 yuan. If the rice and flour, etc., are calculated according to ration prices, they also require more than 60,000 yuan. Even if life is tightened up a bit, or some miscellaneous grains are eaten, the minimum monthly expense for an ordinary family of four cannot be less than 50,000 to 60,000 yuan. If there are more children or parents, siblings, etc. in the family, at least one-fifth more must be added for each additional person. A family of five or six people needs at least about 80,000 yuan in living expenses.

The treatment of the civil servants under the jurisdiction of governments at all levels, in any case, cannot be too far from the above standards. Also, the above is calculated according to current market prices, and the treatment must naturally be adjusted at any time as prices change, and it is more reasonable to settle accounts according to the cost of living index for each month.

Regarding the differentiated treatment of civil servants due to the level of their positions, we believe that the minimum living expenses should be kept uniform as much as possible, and higher-level employees can be paid additional salaries and office expenses. The living and social expenses of senior officials are indeed greater than those of junior officials.

In addition, there is one more point to be raised: for those who live alone locally or have fewer than four family members, we believe that it is not appropriate to particularly reduce their treatment. Single or smaller families have direct and indirect burdens, and the actual burden will not be less. Some have some family members in the countryside, and some unmarried people still have to support their parents, younger siblings, etc. living in their hometowns. At a time when there is a plan to disperse the population, officials with family members in the countryside should not be discriminated against. In reality, the costs of rent, water, and electricity, etc., for those with fewer family members will not be reduced much, and the average food expenses per person will be more expensive than those with more family members. Therefore, while it is certainly appropriate to increase the subsidies for those with more family members, it is unreasonable to deduct the necessities of life for those with fewer family members.

### Army Vice Minister Shibayama Issues Remarks to the Nation

Implementing Donations of Money and Goods for Critical Uses

Tokyo, 29th (Central News Agency Dispatch) Army Vice Minister Shibayama, during the Fourth Subcommittee meeting of the House of Representatives Budget Committee on the 29th, expressed his gratitude to the nation for their enthusiastic donations of money and goods, stating: Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, up to December of last year, the number of cash donations reached 1,389,000, totaling 777,700,000 yen. Material donations amounted to 377,000 items. The cumulative total since the Sino-Japanese War includes 734,000 cash donations, 1,626,000 consolation money contributions, and 80,000 academic incentive grants. In terms of monetary value, national defense donations totaled 777,197,000 yen, consolation money 143,720,000 yen, and school technology incentive grants 15,480,000 yen, totaling 936,180,000 yen. These donations of money and goods are the culmination of the sincere hearts of the people, many of whom are special attack unit soldiers and frontline troops, for which we are particularly grateful. Regarding the use of national defense donations, in accordance with the wishes of the donors, they are used to procure the most critical weaponry and other national defense materials. As of the end of December last year, this has primarily been used to procure 5,982 aircraft, 279 tanks and armored vehicles, 2,075 cannons of various types, 2,151 machine guns of various types, 255 listening devices, 150 searchlights, 758 engines, and other various military vehicles, aviation equipment, communication equipment, etc. National defense donations also include metal military swords, military woolen cloth, military pigeons, and military dogs. These military supplies procured with national defense donations are all supplied to frontline and homeland defense units, directly contributing greatly to combat operations. Therefore, special consideration has been given to these donations of money and goods, and the sincerity of the donors will be respected forever. Consumable weapons such as aircraft will be replaced at national expense with newly manufactured items bearing the same name, to express gratitude to the donors. Consolation money will be used to purchase consolation goods and comfort facilities for deployed units.

### Strong Anti-American Sentiment Among the People of Sichuan and Yunnan Provinces - Statement by Director of Information Matsudaira

The Shanghai office of the Allied Japanese Embassy held a routine press conference at 2:00 PM yesterday, presided over by Director Matsudaira. He discussed the anti-American sentiments among the inland populace and the issue of the Nationalists and Communists. The details are as follows:

Drunkenness and Misconduct Corrupt Public Morals

According to recent arrivals from the interior, there are approximately 1,500 American troops stationed in the Chongqing area, mostly air force personnel, and about 500 in Kunming. In November of last year, public reception centers were established in Chongqing, Chengdu, and Kunming to accommodate these American troops. These centers provide daily meals and drinks, as well as female attendants and singers. Dance parties are held every Tuesday and Friday evening to provide entertainment. However, many American soldiers do not understand the situation in China. Despite receiving such preferential treatment, they still discriminate against the Chinese and often engage in unlawful behavior. They often drive through the city, abducting young women and driving off with them for their amusement, and engage in drunken disturbances frequently. In Kunming alone, in the middle of November last year, there were as many as fourteen disputes between American troops and local residents, nine of which involved women, and the rest involved drunkenness. The corruption of public morals is readily apparent.

Cause of Fire at the American Embassy

After reporting the news, Director Matsudaira continued with his personal thoughts, stating: Foreign news agencies reported that the American Embassy in Chongqing caught fire on the 19th of this month, and the next day the US military headquarters and oil depot also caught fire. According to reports, the fires spread rapidly due to insufficient water pressure. However, in my opinion, the situation may not be that simple. Insufficient water pressure may be a factor, but the fact that the fires broke out repeatedly suggests that the cause was not accidental. It is possible that the fires were deliberately set by the populace due to excessive anti-American sentiment.

The Nationalist-Communist Issue is Not Easily Resolved

Finally, regarding the Nationalist-Communist issue, the Director briefly stated that when Zhou Enlai recently arrived in Chongqing, he made a statement to the press, outlining four points that Mao Zedong hoped for from the Chongqing government: (1) The Chongqing side should promptly convene a National Assembly and implement constitutional governance. (2) Abolish the dictatorship and establish a democratic government. (3) Unify military affairs. (4) Recognize that all parties and factions have equal rights and status. It is currently unknown whether the Nationalist Party will accept these proposals, but it is rumored that Chiang Kai-shek intends to resolve everything through political means.

### Japanese Cotton Yarn and Fabric Merchants Donate to the Thai Government

Bangkok, 29th (Central News Agency Dispatch) Forty Japanese cotton yarn and fabric merchants in Thailand, to express their gratitude for the protection and support of the Thai government, have donated one million Thai baht to the Thai government to help improve the welfare of the Thai people. The donation ceremony was held at 4:00 PM on the 24th at the Thai Prime Minister's residence. Many influential figures from both the Japanese and Thai governments and the public attended. Japanese Ambassador Yamashita presented the aforementioned amount to Thai Prime Minister Abaiboon. A celebration banquet was then held to celebrate the increasingly close relationship between the Japanese and Thai governments and people.

### Japan's Rice and Wheat Harvest for Last Year

Tokyo, 29th (Central News Agency Dispatch) Mr. Yugawa, Director of the Food Administration Bureau of the Japanese Ministry of Agriculture and Commerce, stated on the 29th at the Fifth Subcommittee meeting of the House of Representatives Budget Committee, in response to a question from Mr. Hamaji Bumpei regarding the amount of rice and wheat harvested last year: We are currently investigating the actual amount of rice and wheat harvested last year, so the precise statistical figures are not yet available. The wheat harvest is approximately 24.5 million, and the rice harvest is approximately 60 million to 62 million, as previously announced. Based on the latest information, it may be slightly higher.

### Guangdong Province Holds Security Conference

Guangzhou, 29th (Central News Agency Dispatch) Recently, in various counties of this province, unscrupulous armed groups have frequently set up checkpoints on land and water transportation routes to collect fees, thereby affecting transportation, raising prices, and disrupting local security. The provincial government convened a security conference the day before yesterday, gathering administrative supervisors of various districts and district chiefs and police chiefs of various counties to discuss measures to ensure security and thoroughly prohibit the establishment of checkpoints and the collection of fees. These measures will be promptly and rigorously implemented, and an announcement has been jointly issued by the provincial government and the Pacification Headquarters.

### Revised Fee Schedule for Exit Permits

### Exemption of Rice Levy System for People in Jiangning and Other Counties – Decision of the Capital Price Stabilization Committee

Nanjing, 29th (Central News Agency Dispatch) The plan for stabilizing the prices of essential goods in the capital city area has been drafted by relevant authorities and submitted to and approved by the high authorities. The plan includes exempting the rice levy system for people in Jiangning, Piaoshui, and Jurong counties. The content stipulates that two dou of public rice should be handed over per mu, equivalent to five dou of paddy rice, to be purchased at the public price of 3,700 yuan per shi. Therefore, the rice consumed by Japanese residents and factories will be allocated by the Nanjing Special Municipality in conjunction with the Nanjing Office of the Rice Administration Committee. It is reported that the Jiangning County Government previously negotiated with the Rice Administration Committee Office to contract for 150,000 shi of rice. The Jiangning County Government has also urged various districts to actively carry out the rice levy. It is understood that the results so far have been quite impressive. However, as of now, the Jiangning County Government has only signed a contract with the Rice Administration Committee Office for 10,000 shi of rice, with over 6,000 shi already delivered to the warehouse. The remaining amount is still being paid. As for the remaining 140,000 shi of rice levy, it is currently unknown how much the Jiangning authorities have collected and whether a contract will be signed in the future to pay off the full amount. Regarding this issue, the Nanjing Office of the Rice Administration Committee intends to ask the relevant authorities to investigate the actual amount collected by the district offices in the county and make reasonable arrangements.

### Japanese Minister for Greater East Asia Clarifies New Policy Toward China - Making Every Effort to Enhance Sino-Japanese Relations

Tokyo, 29th (Central News Agency Dispatch) Japanese Minister for Greater East Asia, Shigemitsu, stated on the afternoon of the 28th at the First Subcommittee meeting of the House of Representatives in response to a question from Mr. Tanaka Ko, that the key to resolving the Greater East Asia War lies in Sino-Japanese cooperation, and that Japan's new policy toward China is continuing to advance along this line. The Q&A is as follows:

(Mr. Tanaka asked) The purpose of this war is to make the Chinese people aware that their position should be based on the Greater East Asia and to cooperate in the construction of the Greater East Asia. For this purpose, Japan must have a full understanding of the Chinese people's minds and promote countermeasures and policies. I would like to ask the government about its measures in this regard.

(Mr. Shigemitsu answered) The Greater East Asia War originated from the China issue and will also end with the China issue, as I have said before. The resolution of this war depends solely on Sino-Japanese cooperation, and Japan's new policy toward China is advancing along this line. The government intends to continue to make every effort to enhance Sino-Japanese relations.

(Mr. Tanaka asked) Gaining the hearts of the Chinese people depends on the quality of politics in the peaceful areas. Therefore, it is not only necessary to strengthen cooperation with the National Government, but also to make efforts to directly grasp the hearts of the people. War and economic control are unavoidable, but I believe that special consideration and discretion should be given to the control in China. What are your views?

(Mr. Shigemitsu answered) It is of course impossible to think of economic control in the same way as in Japan. For civil administration in China, it is appropriate to take measures that suit the Chinese people. However, since a large number of Japanese troops are currently stationed there, some degree of economic control is unavoidable.

(Mr. Tanaka asked) I believe it is unreasonable to expect the same things from the Chinese as from the Japanese. What are your views?

(Mr. Shigemitsu answered) China has its own position, and the Chinese people have their own ideas. For us, it is necessary to fully understand and respect the position of the Chinese people and promote policies. We must never have the idea of the Japanese and take actions that are forced and incomprehensible.

### Minister Horiuchi and Others Leave Japan to Return to Their Posts - New Economic Policy to Be Implemented Soon

Nanjing, 29th (Central News Agency Dispatch) With regard to the fact that Japan, an allied nation, in order to assist our country in establishing a wartime economic system, vigorously exert the total power of the decisive battle, is giving further cooperation in accordance with the spirit of the alliance treaty and the spirit of the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration, there were discussions on implementing a new economic policy toward China at the 86th session of the Japanese parliament. The news spread, and our country's government and public alike were unanimous in their eagerness and deep expectation. The local authorities of the Japanese Army, Navy, and Embassy in China are now actively drafting plans. It is reported that Minister Horiuchi of the Embassy and Counselor Okazaki of the Shanghai Office jointly went to Japan a week ago to hold specific consultations with the heads of the Japanese government on this matter. Now, both have returned to Shanghai on the 28th, and a preliminary decision has been made regarding the plan. They are currently holding final consultations with the local military and political authorities and the National Government authorities, and it is scheduled to be officially announced and implemented in the near future. It is expected that an economic institution will be established in the future to exert the functions of a high-level economic general staff headquarters. Therefore, it is predicted that the implementation of the new policy will make great contributions to enhancing our country's participation in the war, as well as stabilizing the people's livelihood in the rear.

### Foreign Minister Shigemitsu Clarifies Japan's War Aims - Building a World of Freedom and Equality

Tokyo, 29th (Central News Agency Dispatch) Japanese Foreign Minister Shigemitsu, at the First Subcommittee meeting of the House of Representatives Budget Committee on the 28th, answered questions from Mr. Kayama and clarified the inconsistency between Japan's just war aims and the war aims of the anti-Axis countries. The purpose of their war, which was fully exposed at the Dumbarton Oaks Conference, is only to thoroughly defeat Japan and Germany, but our war aims are to build a world of freedom and equality. The basis of the Greater East Asia Declaration is also at this point.

Tokyo, 28th (Central News Agency Dispatch) Japanese Minister for Greater East Asia, Shigemitsu, stated on the afternoon of the 28th at the First Subcommittee Committee of the House of Representatives, in response to a question from Mr. Shoten Goen Koji regarding the Empire's Islamic policy: The purpose of the Greater East Asia War is the construction of the Greater East Asia and the liberation of the nations. Most of the Muslims in the Greater East Asia are also oppressed nations, and Japan will naturally spare no effort to fully cooperate in the liberation of Muslims. Recently, the Turkish government announced the severance of diplomatic relations with Japan, but as the Turkish Foreign Minister argued to me, it was due to the coercive demands of Britain and the United States, and not the original intention of the Turkish government. Therefore, these measures do not represent the will of Muslims, and there is no need to elaborate further. Japan's policy toward Muslims is extremely clear in Japan's allowing the independence of the Indonesian nation. Japan will always guide Muslims in the spirit of the Greater East Asia Declaration to a policy of firm strikes, friendship, cooperation, mutual respect, and assistance.

### Central Government Agencies to Replace Identification Cards

Nanjing, 29th (Central News Agency Dispatch) The identification cards for staff members of various central government agencies for this year have been uniformly issued by the National Government Military Affairs Department. The official certificates used by senior and junior officials are dark brown, those for probationary officials are orange-yellow, and those for staff members, public servants, and workers are teal. All previously issued old cards are invalid. If any retired staff members are found to be still using old cards, they will be severely punished.

### The European Situation and the Clash of the Three Powers

The pace of the European policy of the three countries, Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union, has gradually begun to be disrupted; of course, this is not an accident, but something that was expected. The reason why the three countries, Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union, were previously able to coordinate on Europe was because they had common ground on two points: destroying the new European order established by Germany and opposing the fascist regime. After destroying the German new order, when it comes to the question of what concepts and ideas to use to build Europe, the three countries cannot but fall into great contradictions. Their coordination can be said to be "relatively possible, but absolutely impossible." The process of destroying the German new order is the stage of relative coordination, and the so-called designing and building Europe is the stage of entering absolute opposition.

Seeing that the situation was unfavorable, Germany withdrew its troops to its homeland in accordance with strategic requirements. The three countries, Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union, who closely followed, showed political restraint everywhere in the "liberated European territory" due to the different national characteristics of each other. The United States's ambition for Europe is to use Europe as one wing of its gold standard world domination. This can already be seen in the after-war security mechanism designed by the United States. Of course, the United States is loudly advocating non-interference in European countries, but its true intention is to use this to restrain Britain and the Soviet Union's in-depth involvement in Europe, in order to make Europe accept its political influence and complete its ambition to dominate Europe. Britain has always adhered to its old trick of dividing spheres of influence in order to maintain the important parts of Europe, thereby salvaging the decline of the British Empire. As for the Soviet Union, as it designed in the after-war security mechanism, it believes that the British method of dividing Europe into various spheres of influence is unreasonable, and always recognizes Europe as an indivisible whole, but in this attitude, we can see the Soviet Union's independent and far-sighted vision for European policy. The recent Soviet-French alliance is also opposing Britain's conservative attitude. The Soviet Union has also repeatedly stated the principle of non-interference in the internal affairs of European countries, but with the condition of eliminating fascist regimes, which is an attempt to establish pro-Soviet regimes within each country.

Unfortunately, it is the so-called "liberated" European countries that are under the clash of the European policies of these three countries. From Britain and the United States, European countries get no bread, only verbal "freedom", in addition to hunger and cold, they also suffer political chaos. Italy, which accepted the plots of Britain and the United States and had Badoglio betray, is in a state of hunger throughout the country. Greece and Belgium are in a state of anarchy due to the harassment of armed guerrillas. So what is worth noting is that a strong red force is gradually emerging throughout Europe. All phenomena such as chaos, poverty, and hunger are the best places to create red forces. This proves that Soviet forces or pro-Soviet elements are growing day by day everywhere in Europe. What Britain and the United States, especially Britain, are deeply pained and worried about is this trend. Britain, which has long regarded Greece as its sphere of influence, according to common sense, is suffering both internal and external consequences. Britain recognized the Curzon Line for the division of Poland, tore up the Atlantic Charter itself, and only cared about showing flattery to the Soviet Union in order to seek Soviet help, which only exposed Britain's lack of integrity and incompetence to the world.

But the facts are not as the Allies thought. Germany, which has been enduring and being cautious for a long time, taking advantage of the contradictions between them, has gathered the total power of the country and launched an offensive. They will soon destroy this fantasy of trying to decide the fate of Europe without regard to Germany, the central force of Europe. (Translated by Lin from the Asahi Shimbun on December 25)

### German Reinforcements Gather on the Eastern Front: Preparing for a Major Counteroffensive; Breslau Becomes a Strong Fortress

Berlin, December 29th, Central News Agency Telegraph – A German news agency reports that German Chief of Staff General Mudra recently issued a declaration to German forces on the Eastern Front, stating: "Do not be misled by the loss of territory on the Eastern Front. The German High Command is currently implementing a clear plan and is capable of controlling the entire army. No German units or divisions have been captured. German forces are currently withdrawing westward from the middle reaches of the Vistula River, and their vanguard units have reached previously prepared new positions. At the same time, reinforcements have departed from various locations. Once the German forces are fully assembled, they will engage the enemy. The German High Command will determine the date of the counteroffensive."

Berlin, December 29th, Central News Agency Telegraph – A German news agency reports that a local afternoon newspaper commented on the war situation, stating: "Millions of German soldiers and a large number of supply units are heading to the Eastern Front. It will take time to contain the Soviet offensive. Temporary measures can avert immediate danger, but we do not need them. Superficial developments may alarm the inexperienced, but the German High Command is maintaining the secrecy of its countermeasures as much as possible."

Berlin, December 29th, Central News Agency Telegraph – Huitong News Agency reports that Soviet forces are launching a fierce attack from the southeast via Briglau and have reached the outskirts of Breslau. German forces and people's defense units are fighting hard to defend the city. Obstacles have been placed on the main roads, and the number of tank traps is increasing daily. Breslau is gradually transforming into a fortress, with people of all ages serving as guards. The city has abundant food supplies, and efforts are being made to protect the water supply. A major battle is expected in the coming days.

Berlin, December 29th, Central News Agency Telegraph – Huitong News Agency reports that German units engaged in mobile warfare behind Soviet lines are effectively containing the Soviet forces. This does not mean that the previous major battles have subsided. On the contrary, fierce fighting is taking place at all key points reached by the Soviet vanguard, especially in the Upper Silesia industrial area, east and southeast of Königsberg, Breslau, Pitschen, Schneidemühl, Toruń, Bromberg, and Marienburg. The Upper Silesia industrial area has been fortified, and the Soviet offensive is particularly intense.

Fierce Fighting Rages on the Banks of the Warta River

After repeated defeats in key battles, Soviet forces have broken through into areas such as Katowice, Posen, and Hindenburg. Units attacking from Gleiwitz have also made progress to the south and southeast. The fighting is gradually approaching Breslau. In the past 24 hours, Soviet attacks on the east and northeast of the city have been unsuccessful. German forces are currently fighting in the Cosel-Glogau area to prevent the Soviets from establishing a bridgehead on the west bank of the Warta River. There are no new developments in the vicinity of Brandenburg and Schneidemühl. The defenses of fortresses such as Posen, Schneidemühl, and Toruń are effective. The Bromberg garrison is currently engaged in street fighting with Soviet forces in the northern part of the city. Soviet forces west of Bromberg are being pushed north and northwest. The Soviets continue to deploy fresh troops in East Prussia and are advancing towards Königsberg. The fighting in the Courland area has eased.

### German Government Organizes Search for Missing Persons

Berlin, December 29th, Central News Agency Telegraph – Huitong News Agency reports that due to the recent fighting in eastern Germany, people across the country are searching for their families, displaced employees are looking for the new addresses of their factories or companies, and men are searching for their mothers, wives, and children. Germany has already established a "Central Information Bureau for Evacuees" and is now handling this matter for them, recording the names, occupations, ages, and original addresses of missing persons in order to help find them. Evacuees and refugees are required to report to the local police station upon arrival in a new location, which often helps locate missing persons.

### Germany and Anti-Axis Powers Exchange Wounded Soldiers and Civilians

Zurich, December 29th, Central News Agency Telegraph – Huitong News Agency reports that all procedures for the exchange of wounded German and Anti-Axis soldiers in Geneva have been finalized and are expected to be completed by the end of this month. As of yesterday, a total of thirteen trains carrying severely wounded German prisoners of war had arrived in Geneva from Marseille, while another eight trains carrying wounded Anti-Axis soldiers had traveled to Marseille via Lorney. At the end of the week, another train carrying 875 German civilians detained in North America, Central America, and South America arrived in Geneva. They recently crossed the Atlantic Ocean aboard Swedish ships to reach Europe and are now temporarily residing near Lausanne, awaiting exchange for an equal number of Anti-Axis civilians.

Constance, December 29th, Central News Agency Telegraph – Huitong News Agency reports that recently, several trains carrying approximately 300 severely wounded prisoners of war from Germany or the Anti-Axis powers have passed through Constance on the German border or Kreuzlingen station on the Swiss border. These two stations mark the beginning of a new life for thousands of prisoners of war. This fact has been facilitated by the International Red Cross. According to the Mayor of Constance, the exchange of severely wounded prisoners of war in Constance will continue. During World War I, no fewer than 500,000 prisoners of war from various countries passed through Constance. This great work is now being carried out again. Constance is a suitable location for the exchange of prisoners of war via Switzerland, as it is neither close to the front lines like Basel nor far from important military transportation routes. Cooperation between Germany, Switzerland, and international organizations is progressing smoothly. According to local sources, tens of thousands of severely wounded prisoners of war will be exchanged here. Hospital trains rely on German and Swiss exchange stations, and nurses carry prisoners of war on stretchers from one train to another for release and repatriation.

### Diplomatic Relations Deteriorate Between El Salvador and Guatemala

Lisbon, December 29th, Central News Agency Telegraph – Huitong News Agency reports that relations between El Salvador and Guatemala have deteriorated sharply after El Salvador's interim President Salinas ordered an indefinite suspension of commercial relations with Guatemala.

A total of 40,000 bags were exported last December, and another 118,000 bags are awaiting shipment to the United States, putting El Salvador in a difficult position.

### American Forces in St. Vith District Launch New Offensive; German Western Border Attacked from the Air

Stockholm, December 29th, Central News Agency Telegraph – Huitong News Agency reports that Reuters' special correspondent with the US First Army, Luo Guan, stated that the US First Army launched a new offensive at 4:00 AM yesterday in the St. Vith district (St. Vith is located southeast of Malmedy).

Berlin, December 29th, Central News Agency Telegraph – Huitong News Agency reports that Anglo-American aircraft, which had not been bombing Germany for a long time due to adverse weather conditions, are once again active in German airspace day and night, especially in the west and southwest. American aircraft targeted Cologne and Dortmund during the day, while British aircraft bombed Stuttgart at night. German anti-aircraft units shot down 21 enemy aircraft in recent air raids.

### Key Points for Increased Agricultural Production in Various Regions in the 34th Year [of the Republic, i.e. 1945]

Nanjing, December 28th, Central News Agency Telegraph – The Agricultural Production Promotion Committee of the Executive Yuan has concluded its meeting on agricultural production in various provinces and cities. The committee believes that the current mission of increasing agricultural production is of great importance and the work is arduous, and that it is appropriate to seize the opportunity and make greater efforts. Therefore, regarding how to promote work in the 34th year, in addition to carefully formulating an outline of a promotion plan, which is being submitted to the Executive Yuan for adjudication and promulgation, detailed instructions were given on how to promote work in various localities this year, and they were compiled into key points. The full text is as follows:

(A) Regarding agricultural production promotion groups:

(1) The establishment of township agricultural promotion associations. Township agricultural promotion associations are automatic planning and implementation agencies for promoting township agricultural production and revitalizing the rural economy, organizing mutual aid societies, etc. They should be organized and established separately within the designated county areas for implementing increased production, with core farmers trained in cooperatives as the center. A total of 610 associations have been established in the past year. This year, instead of seeking an increase in quantity, the focus will be on enriching the content. However, within the newly designated county areas for implementing increased production this year, it is still planned to add 100 associations. In order to promote the work of the promotion associations, those established last year will be subsidized 4,000 yuan per association per year, and those newly established this year are expected to be subsidized 6,000 yuan per association per year.

(2) Local cooperatives have always been the center of private organizations promoting agricultural production. The establishment of experimental farms, the improvement of farming techniques, and guidance and encouragement. The allocation of agricultural materials such as seeds, fertilizers, draft cattle, agricultural implements, and agricultural machinery, the training of core farmers, the training of technicians, the guidance of promotion associations and mutual aid societies, and other matters related to agricultural production all rely on the active promotion of cooperatives. Therefore, economic assistance should be provided for the training of technicians necessary for cooperatives, with an estimated subsidy of 7,000 yuan per person per month, but the total is limited to 350 people. (To be continued)

### Internal Strife in the United States: Public Dissatisfaction Becomes Increasingly Widespread

In his speech at the first cabinet meeting of the Japanese government on January 4th of this year, Koiso said, "The enemy America may be plotting to make up in the Pacific for what they lose on the European front." I believe that what Prime Minister Koiso meant by this was that the enemy American authorities, in order to maintain their domestic image and suppress public dissatisfaction, intended to work harder in the Pacific theater. In this regard, it is not "perhaps." There is ample reason to judge that the enemy America definitely has this intention.

Now, taking the leading Allied power, the United States, alone, the German offensive that began in mid-December gave the American people a tremendous shock. Long before the offensive, the American people had already harbored an uneasy attitude towards the European front. The battle near Aachen, due to fierce German resistance, consumed more than three months of American ammunition. As a result, Eisenhower had to complain, as if aggrieved, that it would be impossible to begin an offensive without new supplies. Thus, the conversion of some military-industrial plants to civilian production, which had been promised during the presidential election, was indefinitely postponed. Of course, this is also a common trick of Roosevelt to deceive the people, but it should not be overlooked that this was out of necessity. The people were filled with great disappointment and extreme unease. Coincidentally, the Rundstedt Offensive began during this period.

The American people were very angry at the military's self-proclaimed victorious pronouncements. The Times published an article at the end of last year saying, "Admiral Halsey said in his New Year's message in 1943, 'This year, we will completely crush the Axis powers.' General Arnold, Chief of the Army Air Forces, said in February of the same year, 'I promise you that we will be in Berlin next February.' General Clark said in November of the same year, 'I firmly believe that the European war will end before November 1944, and we will achieve final victory.' Undersecretary of the Army Patterson said in August 1944, 'Achieving a complete victory in the war against Germany is no longer a distant prospect.' In addition, Chief of Staff Marshall published an article in the December 17th issue of 'Army and Navy' magazine, saying, 'Before my article is published in the magazine, the European war may very well be declared over.' There are countless empty words of comfort like these."

The German offensive, with lightning speed, destroyed one-third of the Western Front's American combat power in less than three weeks. The stretched American censorship institutions tried to conceal the facts, but instead leaked the truth all the more, truly proving "the more you try to hide, the more it shows." The anxious national mood, with a thousand threads of thought, wanted to inquire about everything, such as: Since the Three-Power Conference was decided in Dumbarton Oaks, why has it been delayed (Roosevelt had to remain silent to appease the recent public outcry)? Why has the Atlantic Charter, generally recognized as a symbol of Allied unity, been quietly set aside? Are the British troops under Montgomery standing by idly while the American troops fight hard (a unit of British troops on the Belgian front only appeared on January 4th, according to a report from the Associated Press)? In addition, there are numerous problems such as Poland, Greece, Chongqing, and others that disturb the American people's spirit.

Roosevelt and his party could not cope with these domestic phenomena. They were extremely anxious, very worried that the accumulated resentment of the people, once it erupted, would be unstoppable. Therefore, in order to alleviate this popular psychology, they launched a fierce and desperate battle in the Philippines. Today's enemy America may be invincible, but once it suffers a setback, its domestic situation will take a sharp turn for the worse. The fate of the Greater East Asia War is decided at this moment.

### Mayor Zhou Meets with Reporters: Expresses His Political Aspirations and Announces Three Major Plans to Stabilize the People's Livelihood

Since Mayor Zhou took office, he has paid attention to city affairs, especially the current issues of rising prices, inadequate supplies, and corruption among officials. He is committed to exerting his efforts to serve as a representative. Mayor Zhou, in his busy political affairs, met with reporters from the city's Chinese newspapers at the Nanking City Government yesterday (29th) morning to answer questions raised by the reporters. The content of the question-and-answer session is as follows:

Three Major Plans to Stabilize the People's Livelihood

(Question) When Mayor Zhou first took office in the city, all the main authorities were eagerly awaiting the stabilization of the people's livelihood, the elimination of corruption, and other issues. What are the important plans and policies of the Nationalist government?

(Answer) The most important thing at present is to stabilize the people's livelihood. I will start with the following three items: (A) Price issue: Lowering prices directly and strictly controls prices. There is currently an important plan to suppress black market rice prices, which is being actively implemented and is expected to be resolved soon. (B) Production increase issue: The fundamental way to stabilize the people's livelihood is to increase production. Plans are being made to increase coal and electricity production to meet the essential needs of the people. The industrial system must be developed, and the supply of daily necessities must be ensured. This is currently under study. (C) Corruption issue: During wartime, various prices have risen, and corruption has become rampant. Shanghai is the most affected, and this is due to human causes. I will ensure that such human factors are eliminated. I have decided to severely punish those who manipulate prices and engage in profiteering after they are discovered. Regarding the corruption of officials, I recently summoned the responsible persons from the courts and told them that I feel that the current investigation of corruption cases is too slow due to legal procedures. The effect of curbing corruption is diminished because the cases are dealt with using external methods. For example, a case this year may not be resolved until next year, which reduces its effectiveness. Therefore, I am determined to resolve corruption cases quickly. For example, the recent case of the alteration of the Wuhan lottery tickets was dealt with quickly and severely. I hope that the prosecutors will pay attention to corruption cases and implement (1) no bail, (2) quick trial, and (3) the highest penalties.

In the future, I will seek instructions from the Central Government and be given full authority to deal with corruption and financial cases by the Security Command with military trials, without leniency.

Corruption and Treacherous Merchants to be Punished by Military Law

(Question) Prices are rising due to various reasons, but there is a lack of supply, which is a major reason. Has the municipal government established a plan to improve the control of commodity sources?

(Answer) The central government is handling the smoothing of commodity sources and the supply of goods.

(Question) In the previous "14th case," only low-level personnel were investigated and punished, which is not enough to cleanse the government. Does the current government have the determination to arrest traitors? If such cases or treacherous acts are encountered, will they be investigated thoroughly?

(Answer) This is not only the determination of the municipal government, but also the intention of the central government. Therefore, we are determined to thoroughly investigate and punish any corruption or treacherous acts in the future.

(Question) In the past, there have often been cases where, after investigation and punishment were implemented, they were just talk on paper. For example, the recent case of the lottery ticket fraud of Gongda (i.e., the Big Six lottery ticket), which involved tens of millions of yuan, has disappeared without a trace. Also, there was a case involving ten merchants in Xiaru. It is said that the case file was lost and bail was paid, but there has been no further news. Does the mayor plan to thoroughly investigate this case?

(Answer) The fact that legal procedures are slow and cumbersome is a reality. In the future, we will adopt military trials.

Manipulation of Gold is Under Investigation

(Question) Recently, the price of gold has been rising again, and prices are rising again. What measures does the government have to deal with this? In the previous case of gold manipulation, a large number of people were acquitted because gold was not considered a major commodity. This has only fueled the rise in gold prices. Gold is the only guarantee for legal tender and represents all commodities. Therefore, manipulating gold is a serious crime that disrupts the current financial situation. I hope you will investigate and deal with it severely to curb this trend.

(Answer) I have ordered the police and security authorities to secretly investigate. If anything is found, it will be dealt with severely.

Proper Handling of Price-Fixing by Trade Associations

(Question) Trade associations raise prices and conspire with corrupt economic authorities. They exploit this phenomenon and mutually benefit, causing prices to soar. Please deal with this strictly.

(Answer) In the future, we will take appropriate measures, and the Economic Bureau has also been improved.

Finally, reporters asked questions about municipal issues and donation of resources to the city. Mayor Zhou answered each question in detail.

### Mayor Zhou Encourages Employees of the Goods Allocation Office to Improve Their Shortcomings and Work Hard in Their Future Duties

Mayor Zhou met with the high-ranking officials of the Municipal Goods Allocation Office at the Municipal Government yesterday (29th) morning at 10:00 a.m. The attendees included the chief of the office, planning officials, and section chiefs. After briefly reviewing each person's background, Mayor Zhou gave an impromptu speech. The original text is recorded as follows:

"Since I took office as the Mayor of Shanghai, I am determined to create a new Shanghai. The Goods Allocation Office has a close relationship with the citizens. In the past, there have been many criticisms from the outside. I believe that Director Liu will definitely be able to learn from the past and improve. I hope that all of you, under his leadership, will correct past shortcomings and work hard in your future duties. The supply of allocated goods is limited. The government will seek ways from all relevant parties. As for how to allocate fairly, I hope everyone will cooperate in their respective positions. It is necessary to distribute them equally, so that those who need a lot get a lot, and those who need little get little. We must strictly adhere to the principles of not causing difficulties, not deducting, and not colluding with shops for fraud. Work hard with conscience, contribute more to society, and you will be praised by all parties. In the past, special allocations were often unequal, so adjustments should be made. In terms of personnel, there were many people in the past, and it was very costly. There were inevitably people with uneven quality, so efforts should be made to adjust. Use an objective perspective to assess daily performance. For those who are not good, try to eliminate them, so as to achieve the goal of getting things done with fewer people and more capabilities. At the same time, I hope that everyone will pass on my words to the staff below and work together."

### Police Bureau Structure to be Adjusted

Since Director Zhou took office as the head of the Municipal Police Bureau, he has been innovating and striving to promote major police affairs. It is understood that the Bureau, in order to increase work efficiency, has decided to adjust its internal structure. The original nine departments will be reduced to seven. Each department and section will also be merged or reduced depending on the complexity of the work. The original large sections of each sub-bureau will be reorganized into four sections. The transmission of official documents will be simplified and the efficiency of the work will be improved. Adjustments will also be made to personnel. It is expected that the changes will be implemented in early next month.

### Detective Carries Smoke Bomb; Suffers Accident Yesterday

Yesterday (the 29th) morning, a No. 2 tram, fully loaded with passengers, caught fire while heading outwards. The incident occurred at 11:20 AM when the tram was stopped at the intersection of Jing'an Temple Road. Thick smoke immediately filled the air, attracting onlookers. Passengers inside, unable to wait for the conductor to open the doors, scrambled out through the ticket window and over the iron gates. Fortunately, no one was killed or injured. According to investigations, the cause of the accident was that Li Moukun, a detective from the Judicial Section of the Chongshan Road Police Sub-bureau, was ordered to carry a smoke bomb to the Inspection Section of the Fuzhou Road Headquarters. Unaware of the dangerous nature of the device, he boarded the tram, resulting in the unfortunate incident. His hands and clothes were slightly burned and damaged.

### Changes in Directors of Shangnan and Shangchuan Road Bureaus

It is approved that director of the Shangnan and Shangchuan Road Bureaus, which are subordinate to the Municipal Bureau of Public Utilities, will be replaced. The current director is being replaced, and the deputy director will remain Zhang.

### Shanghai Epidemic Prevention Branch Holds Its First General Meeting of the Year

In accordance with regulations, the Shanghai Special Municipality Investment Committee's ten committee members are to be appointed by the current mayor. To welcome the newly appointed ten committee members and to discuss the epidemic prevention plan for the 34th year of the Republic, the committee recently convened its first general meeting of the year. Attendees included Mayor Zhou Mouhai (represented by the Chief Qing), Deputy Director Moumou, Secretary Chen Yidao, Major General Shibata Kazuo, Lieutenant Colonel Honma Shigeo, Lieutenant Colonel Onodera Yoshio, Ambassador Ryunosuke Kiyosawa, and Chen Zhongdong, among others. Director Lu Jianzhi of the Health Department and Director Chen Zhong of the Central Epidemic Prevention Bureau also attended the meeting. Secretary Luo, representing Mayor Zhou, delivered a speech, followed by a speech from Director Chen, who stated that all vaccines and materials used for epidemic prevention this year would be manufactured by the Central Epidemic Prevention Bureau of each country. Local epidemic prevention committees needing materials could apply directly for them. Next, the director reported on the epidemic prevention work of the past year. Chen Yeqin reported on the number of people vaccinated, stating that approximately 200,000 people had been vaccinated to date. With more than half the time remaining, it was hoped that citizens would be vaccinated. Finally, the meeting discussed the action plan for this year.

### Shortage of Reserve Certificates and Cash; Gradual Resolution Expected

To alleviate the issue of cash shortage in the market, the Central Reserve Bank of China began issuing new 500-yuan and 10-yuan banknotes yesterday. According to sources from the local financial sector, banks and money shops have recently faced frequent requests for reserve certificates, leading to a shortage of cash in circulation. To facilitate withdrawals for customers, banks and money shops, when customers withdraw large sums, would pay part of the amount in cash and issue payment orders for amounts exceeding 50,000 yuan. The Banking and Money Industry Association believes that the cash shortage is causing inconvenience for businesses and the public. Therefore, it convened a joint meeting recently, requesting the Central Reserve Bank to find ways to alleviate the cash shortage. Now that the bank has issued new banknotes, the situation should gradually improve. At the same time, the practice of issuing payment orders for customer withdrawals should gradually decrease.

### Shanghai Chongqing Bank Moves to New Location for Business

The Shanghai Chongqing Bank, located at 176 Jinling Road (formerly Avenue Edward VII), was established in February of the 22nd year of the Republic (1933). Its original location was in the Wuzhou Building on Fuzhou Road. Due to business expansion, it has moved to its current address. Zhu Chunxi remains the manager of the bank. Yesterday (the 28th) was the opening day at the new location.

### New Association Shanghai Branch Hosts Banquet for Zhao Xuan; Director Chen Offers Three Suggestions

The Shanghai branch of the Chinese News Association hosted a banquet yesterday (the 29th) at the Gongnan Restaurant to welcome newly appointed Director Zhao of the Propaganda Department, Deputy Director Sun Jing, who was in Shanghai on official business, and Liu, the newly appointed Director of the Municipal Propaganda Office. Deputy Director Sun, Director Liu, and other guests attended on time, including Lieutenant Moumou and Second Lieutenant Moumou of the Army, Adjutant Maeda, Captain Tanaka of the Propaganda Department, Trustees Bei Moufu and Akita Masao, Maboroshi Kazuo, Wang Bingnan, Director Matsudaira Kiyoshi of the Information Department of the Japanese Ambassador's Shanghai Office, Vice Consul Fukama, Secretary Kawamura, Bureau Chief Fan Zuesheng of Tongjian, and Sanzhai Moumou of the China Service News Agency. Local attendees included Chairman Moumou, Moumou, Yu Yu, Moumou, Moumou, Bao Tianxiao, Lou Moumou, Moumou, Moumou, Moumou, Moumou, Moumou, Zhang Shanyan, Chairman Li Sihao of the Chinese Journalists Association, and representative Moumou of the Association, totaling over a hundred people. Chen Binhe, Director of the Shanghai Branch, and executive directors such as Moumou, Moumou, Xu Liqiu, Jin Xiongbo, Gong Jingsu, Chen Riping, Moriyama Takashi, and Feng Yelei warmly welcomed the guests. Director Chen Binhe delivered a welcome speech, followed by a speech from Director Zhao. The banquet concluded at 2:00 PM.

Chen Binhe's Speech

Director Chen Binhe stated in his speech: "Today, the Shanghai branch of the Chinese News Association welcomes Director Zhao of the Propaganda Department, Deputy Director Sun, and Director Liu of the Municipal Propaganda Office. We are grateful for their presence, as well as for the participation of the Allied Press Corps and members of the Chinese and Japanese cultural and journalistic communities."

"Director Zhao and Deputy Director Jing are both from the journalistic field. Director Liu is familiar with the News Association. Therefore, there is no need to introduce them in detail. On behalf of this welcoming gathering, I would like to offer three suggestions to the authorities: First, I hope to enrich news sources and news materials. Regarding the improvement of news materials, I hope to strengthen the central unified management and improve the treatment of reporters. In terms of both funding and personnel, the News Association will do its best. Secondly, among the news sources, newspapers are the most important. However, the price of newspaper paper has skyrocketed. Before the incident, the price of newspaper paper was three yuan per order. Now, it has risen to over 40,000 yuan, an increase of 15,000 times. This is simply outrageous."

"(Two) Improve the living conditions of news reporters and cultural figures. In recent years, prices have risen sharply. The news and cultural circles engaged in propaganda work are living in extreme hardship. I hope that Director Zhao will take steps to gradually improve the situation. Regarding the key distribution of supplies to news reporters, it should include all news workers. I deeply hope that the director will assist in the early realization of this.

(Three) Cultivate news talents. Currently, there is a great shortage of news talents. I hope that the Propaganda Department will establish institutions to cultivate new news talents. Although the Shanghai News Federation has a Young Journalist Training Class, it is small in scale and weak in strength. In the future, I hope that the department will pay special attention to this."

"In recent years, this gathering of the propaganda community is the most grand. This shows the enthusiasm and sincerity of the news and cultural circles towards the new three officials. We will work together to promote national policies and strive together under the guidance of propaganda administration."

Director Zhao's Speech

"I am unworthy of the hospitality today. Especially since I have served in the journalistic community for many years, and those present are all old and new colleagues, I am even more undeserving of this welcome. I originally declined the position of Director of the Propaganda Department due to a lack of talent. However, I was persuaded because Director Lin of the Ministry had become the Director of the Anhui Provincial Government, and I have experience in the news industry, so I could not refuse. I have always had the ideal of combining news and propaganda, and I would like to take this opportunity to discuss it with everyone."

"News focuses on faithful reporting. Propaganda focuses on enlightenment and guidance. Everyone knows this. If both are done well, then enlightenment can be achieved within the reporting. This is the so-called combination. Some may think that propaganda focuses on restriction, while news only focuses on reporting. However, propaganda and news are both aimed at the entire population, and there should be no opposition between the two. If all news is subject to restriction, then how can democracy be healthy? How can public opinion be expressed? This is not the government's original intention, nor is it something that the journalistic community will accept. However, if news reporting fails to embody national policies and guide the public, then its drawbacks will be immeasurable. In short, propaganda administration assists the journalistic community to fulfill its mission and develop its potential under national policies. The journalistic community should also fulfill its responsibilities of reporting and propaganda under national policies."

"Our country's news industry is only 70 or 80 years old. It has been thriving for only over 30 years. The government has not paid much attention to the news industry, or even treated it as an object of extra-legal regulation. This has created a situation where the journalistic community and the government unintentionally became opposed to each other. The influence of feudal politics is unspeakable. After the Northern Expedition in the 16th year of the Republic (1927), the status of the journalistic community increased day by day, and the development of the news industry also made progress. As a result, the government also paid more attention to the news industry. Unfortunately, at this time of prosperity, the unfortunate Sino-Japanese Incident occurred, resulting in ten years of effort being ruined in one day. This is truly regrettable."

"The National Government moved its capital in order to continue past achievements and promote them. Therefore, the Propaganda Department was established. Director Lin Baisheng was originally a journalist. When he became the director, he recalled the grand occasion of the past when the Newspaper Association held meetings, and the prosperity of the discussions. After Director Lin took office, he began to make arrangements, and the scale has been greatly improved to this day. I am not talented, and I will continue to implement this plan, and I will not forget my qualifications as a journalist. I will also continue the previous rules of Director Lin, so today I dare not be seen as the Propaganda Minister being entertained by the News Association, but I regard it as a gathering of colleagues in the Newspaper Association."

"Since I have this ambition, what I want to tell you is: First, in terms of the news industry, we must do our best to think about the industry and help the press, but under the current wartime conditions, I hope that you will use wartime systems to do things and do your best to save costs, so that we can overcome difficulties. What is especially important is that the national news industry must be united, not limited to one place or corner. Only through unity can strength be generated. Furthermore, with the cooperation of administrative structures, the strength will be even greater. Second, in terms of speech and reporting, as long as we strictly abide by national policies, we can publish as much as possible. I have a responsibility to guide the news, and the guidance will not be limited to trivial matters. Moreover, I must make the opinions of the people more widely known and provide timely instructions on the political situation, so that the government can obtain assistance from public opinion, serve as ears and eyes, and make up for the lack of research systems and fact-finding. However, I also hope that all reports will be based on facts and should not be distorted or exaggerated. The content can be faithfully recorded for government reference."

"I have been in the journalism industry for a long time, and my friends are all over the north and south. What I said to my colleagues back then is what I have said above. After twenty years, I am now working with my colleagues again. This is the happiest opportunity in my life. Therefore, I still hope to use the words I discussed at the time to roughly present to you. With your efforts, the success of China's news industry in the future will be inevitable."

### "Narcissus" Charity Performance: Fundraising for the Old People's Home

Messrs. Wen Chanting, Li Sihao, Lin Kanghou, Yuan Ludeng and others have initiated a charity play performance to raise funds for the Old People's Home. They have invited renowned Shanghai actors Tang Ruoqing and Shi Hui, as well as other artists, to collaborate and perform for ten days starting from February 1st at the Carlton Theatre.

According to reports, the Old People's Home has been established for over 40 years. It houses over 350 elderly men and women over the age of 60 who are lonely and helpless. They are cared for entirely by nuns through solicitations and personal care. Currently, the home's funds are exhausted, and the expenses are huge, making it difficult to maintain. Although a 5 million yuan fundraising campaign was launched in October last year, the goal is still far away, and the home is heavily in debt, owing as much as 600,000 to 700,000 yuan. Therefore, assistance is urgently needed, and we must fervently hope that kind people in society will help and continue to make broad fundraising efforts to awaken widespread sympathy and concern. Mr. Wen and others have initiated this charity performance. We hope that all sectors will enthusiastically purchase tickets during the period, both to enjoy the famous play and to help the elderly. It is a win-win situation. Why not do it?

We admire your newspaper's enthusiasm and dare not lag behind. We have specially prepared a type of glucose syrup to donate to poor teachers and educational assistance students. However, for the sake of solemnity, if any teachers or students need this medicine, please ask your newspaper to issue a certificate, which they can present to the Da Shanghai Sanatorium at 1050 Daxing Road (bring your own container - an empty beer bottle is sufficient). After Dr. Xu Xuyu signs it, they can collect it with the certificate (every day from 11:00 AM to 1:00 PM and from 5:00 PM to 7:00 PM). This small gesture expresses our sincere heart. As it is a public welfare matter, we hope that your newspaper will provide assistance, which would be greatly appreciated."
