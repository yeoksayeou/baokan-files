### The Japanese Government Held an Emergency Meeting Yesterday: Prime Minister Suzuki Personally Gave Instructions, Exhorting Cabinet Ministers to Strive to Renew Administration

Tokyo, 26th (Central News Agency telegram) - The Japanese government held an emergency cabinet meeting at the Prime Minister's official residence at 11:00 AM on the 26th. Prime Minister Suzuki and all cabinet ministers attended. The Prime Minister spoke about the burning of the Imperial Palace and Omiya Imperial Villa and exhorted the cabinet ministers to strive to renew the administration with unwavering determination. The gist of his speech was as follows: The scale of this air raid was relatively large, and due to the extremely strong winds, there was considerable damage. However, we must not be overly concerned. Such incidents are highly possible during wartime. I hope that all cabinet ministers will work harder and strive to handle state affairs. Many official residences have also been burned down, which may cause inconvenience in handling affairs, but we should take this opportunity to implement reforms and renew the administration, dispel the thought of simply restoring the old, and embrace the spirit of reconstruction. As the people will face increasing hardship due to the damage caused by the air raids, the government must accelerate the implementation of policies. I hope that the policies of each ministry will also change from their usual old practices, overcome all difficulties, and move forward actively.

### Commander-in-Chief Fukuda's Remarks on the 40th Navy Day Anniversary

Today (27th) is the 40th Navy Day anniversary of our allied nations. Commander-in-Chief Fukuda of the Japanese Fleet stationed in China issued the following statement:

As we celebrate the 40th Navy Day anniversary during the most intense decisive battle stage of the Greater East Asia War, I am deeply moved as I look back on the rise and development of the Imperial Japanese Navy over the past 40 years.

Today, the Imperial Navy is united with the elite Imperial Army, overcoming all difficulties and bravely advancing towards the goal of fulfilling the holy war. In China, we are also securing the battlefields, overcoming many increasingly difficult challenges, and diligently fulfilling our important mission day and night for the future destiny of the East Asian people. The evolution of the European war situation is gradually exerting various influences on the East Asian war situation, which goes without saying. However, the Empire's unwavering policy remains to advance towards the goal of East Asian self-defense, closely cooperating with friendly nations such as the Republic of China to break through all hardships for the co-prosperity of one billion people, and will not waver due to changes in the situation.

We are now facing unprecedented difficulties, but the morale of the naval soldiers is even higher. Today, we will carry on the glory and traditions established by our predecessors, fight to the death to reduce the arrogant enemy, and repay the sacred expectations. We will enhance the welfare of one billion people.

Strengthening general relief efforts. To meet this need, the ministry is seeking to improve the institutions directly under its control, such as the Central Relief Institute and its five other affiliated branches. 2. Providing relief for air raid disasters. The ministry is focusing its efforts on this and is actively planning a comprehensive relief plan for air raid disasters. 3. Promoting rural welfare services.

Stockholm, 26th (Central News Agency telegram) - According to messages received here: Chairman Stalin made a speech at the "Victory Banquet" held in the Kremlin last night, saying, "The unwavering faith of the Soviet people in the government is the key factor in our country's victory this time. Our government authorities have also made mistakes in the past, that is, in 1941 and 1942, our country was indeed in a difficult situation. At this time, our troops had to retreat and abandon many villages and towns. However, our Soviet people did not complain and eventually endured the greatest sacrifices to win the victory over defeated Germany." Finally, he concluded by saying, "This confidence in the government has been proven to be the decisive element in our victory over fascism."

### Unite the East Asian Peoples, Destroy the Arrogant Enemy, England and America: Minister Matsushima's Speech on Navy Day

Minister Matsushima's speech at the Fleet: "As the Greater East Asia War enters a decisive stage, we welcome the 40th Navy Day of Japan. I am extremely grateful that the Shanghai Branch of the Chinese News Association is hosting a commemorative lecture, and I thank all of you for your enthusiastic participation."

### East Asian Countries Work Together

"What I, as a Japanese person, feel is most meaningful today is that forty years ago, Japan was fighting for the survival of the nation itself, but today it is fighting for the East Asian peoples. For the sake of the self-preservation of all East Asian peoples, Japan does not hesitate to engage in arduous battles with the enemies England and America. Prime Minister Suzuki has expressed his determination to fight to the end to strive for victory."

"Today, Japan is determined to carry out this belief, and hopes that its allied nations, China and other countries, will work together. Japan's war against England and America should not be viewed from the perspective of immediate gains and losses. We should plan for the future of the entire East Asian peoples and carry out our beliefs. Moreover, the fleets, military supplies, and manpower of England and America are now being consumed to a great extent."

### The Enemy is Already Feeling Exhausted

"The battle for Okinawa Island has been going on for two months, and the enemy has not yet achieved its goals in its own operations. It has suffered heavy losses both at sea and on land. Especially because of the long distance, the long supply lines, and the difficulties in domestic production, it faces various disadvantages. Now that the war in Europe has come to an end, the enemy is attempting to transfer its forces from the European front to East Asia, but due to various political problems in Europe, such as the disputes in Poland, Austria, and Yugoslavia, as well as the problem of food shortages among European residents, it cannot realize its ideal operational objectives. At the same time, the enemy has been exhausted after fighting in Europe for a long time. If it transfers to East Asia, it is questionable whether it can exert its combat power due to the different environment and terrain. On the Japanese side, we have a consistent belief and are determined to carry it out to the end."

"Furthermore, the enemy intends to imitate the battle tactics of the European theater in its operations in East Asia, with air power as the main force. However, the situation is completely different in the Greater East Asia War, because the main force in the Greater East Asia War is at sea. It is also questionable whether the enemy's blind actions can achieve the desired results."

### East Asian Compatriots Should Not Kill Each Other

"In addition, what the enemy feels is most serious is the problem of transportation capacity. The lack of transport ships makes it difficult to replenish troops. Under the necessary conditions for combat, a large force must be concentrated in a very short period of time. In Europe, England and America can still cope, but in the Greater East Asia Sea, it will be difficult to concentrate their forces. Even if England and America transfer their forces to East Asia in the future, it will be a good opportunity for Japan to defeat them one by one. In the past, when the enemy, the United States, operated in the Philippines, it was already exhausted after using 200,000 troops. Now, in Okinawa Island, it originally intended to maintain 100,000 troops, but it has also faced many difficulties and has only managed to deploy 30,000 to 40,000 people so far. Therefore, if they want to launch an operation on the Chinese mainland in the future, they will inevitably use Chinese manpower as the main force. We are all East Asian compatriots and must not allow the enemy to kill each other with their own forces. On this 40th Navy Day anniversary, I salute the soldiers at the front and pledge to realize our goals and overcome difficulties with this determination."

"Finally, we must not be tempted by rumors and should unite the strong unity of the East Asian peoples to bravely advance on the path of destroying the arrogant enemy."

### The Shanghai Municipal Government and the Jiangsu Provincial Government Return the Towns Under Their Temporary Administration to Each Other: The Township Work is Completed and Returned to the Original Jurisdiction

Afterwards, the Jiangsu Provincial Government reported to the former Township-Cleansing Committee that the township-cleansing work in Jiangsu Province had been completed, and the Shanghai Municipal Government successively requested the Second District Administrative Inspectorate, the Jiading County Government, and the people of the respective townships to recover and restore the administrative system. Therefore, in accordance with the resolution of the National Township-Cleansing Conference in February of the 33rd year that the areas where provinces and cities changed during the township-cleansing period due to blockade relations should be returned to their original administrative system, the Jiangsu Provincial Government was consulted and reported to the Executive Yuan for approval, and they were still returned to the jurisdiction of Jiading County.

Weekly Review

### The Decisive Battle of the Japanese and American Navies

— Zhu Rusong

Just as the outcome of the Russo-Japanese War was decided by the Battle of Tsushima, before the final success or failure of the Greater East Asia War is determined, a decisive naval battle between Japan and the United States must first occur on the Pacific Ocean. Now, the time for the decisive naval battle is approaching. At this moment, we are pleased to celebrate the 40th Japanese Navy Day. Looking back on the past, we can foresee the future. I will now examine the characteristics of the Japanese Navy and the prospects for this decisive battle.

Forty years ago, the fleets of Japan and Russia engaged in a major battle east of the Tsushima Strait. As a result, the Japanese Combined Fleet, under the command of Marshal Togo, achieved a final victory by overcoming the enemy with fewer forces. The reasons for this are nothing more than the following points:

Japan's campaign was to resist the aggression of Imperial Russia. Therefore, the entire country shared the same hatred and united as one. Furthermore, with the traditional spirit of the Japanese Navy, everyone, regardless of whether they were at the front or the rear, was willing to dedicate themselves to the country. The morale was extremely high. This spirit of sincere unity and devotion to the country was the spiritual foundation for Japan's victory over Russia.

At that time, Marshal Togo of Japan set up an ambush in the vital areas of Japan's coastal waters, waiting for the Imperial Russian fleet to walk into the trap. Because the Russian Baltic Fleet had traveled a long distance across the ocean and was exhausted, while the Japanese Combined Fleet was well-rested and waiting for the enemy to tire, it was able to wipe out the enemy in one fell swoop, laying the foundation for the final victory.

The Japanese Navy's excellent training, the outstanding talent of its commanders, and the superiority of its tactics and strategy were also important factors in defeating the enemy. Therefore, less than half an hour after the Japanese and Russian fleets opened fire, the Russian fleet was in chaos and eventually collapsed.

Since the beginning of the Greater East Asia War, the naval battles between the Japanese and American forces have numbered no less than several dozen. During this time, the Japanese Navy, based on its glorious traditional spirit, demonstrated admirable strength everywhere, such as in the Battle of Hawaii, the Battle of the Coral Sea, the Battle of Taiwan, the Battle of the Philippines, and the Battle of Okinawa. Especially since the start of the Battle of Leyte Gulf, the Japanese military's Kamikaze Special Attack Units displayed their power, dying together with the enemy. We can also see this tragic determination to sacrifice oneself for benevolence in the Russo-Japanese War, when the Japanese military besieged Lushun. Currently, Japan's operations in the Pacific against the United States have several similarities to the Russo-Japanese War.

First, this time, Japan is fighting against Britain and the United States for self-preservation and to shatter the ambitions of Britain and the United States to invade East Asia. It is a righteous army with resolute fighting spirit. Conversely, Britain and the United States are fighting for aggression, sacrificing lives and resources for the benefit of a few financial cliques. Anti-war sentiments have already arisen in the enemy's countries. Moreover, the contradictions between Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union have currently formed a very delicate situation. Therefore, Britain and the United States feel deeply anxious and restless about the current situation.

Second, today, the American forces are in a position of external operations. Communication with the rear is very inconvenient. They must cross the vast Pacific Ocean and travel a long distance of 10,000 kilometers to reach the front lines. As for the British fleet, it must pass through the Mediterranean Sea and the Indian Ocean. Therefore, how to fully supply the troops fighting at the front and maintain their offensive power and mobility is indeed a very difficult problem for them. Conversely, Japan's transportation lines are very short, and it is fighting in the waters near its own country, clearly occupying the advantages of geography and human relations. Therefore, as long as the opportunity arises, it can strike the enemy with a fatal blow in one fell swoop.

Third, the modern Japanese Navy not only continues to maintain their traditional superior spirit, but is also greatly strengthening its power and sharpening its swords. On the first of this month, the Naval General Headquarters was re-established, and General Toyoda was appointed as the first Commander-in-Chief, completing the integration of the Japanese Combined Fleet and all naval combat units under the jurisdiction of the various naval districts and guard districts, thereby better adapting to the complexity of modern warfare.

Finally, there are two more points worth noting: First, in modern warfare, aircraft have become the main weapon, playing a decisive role in the outcome of the war. And the Japanese mainland is now no less than a great aviation fortress. Therefore, when Britain and the United States approach Japan, they suffer great losses due to the fierce attacks of the Japanese air force. For example, in the Okinawa area, from March 23 to May 10, the enemy has already lost more than 510 ships. In the future, their losses will inevitably increase day by day. Second, Japan's campaign this time is not only supported by the united will of the entire nation, but also receives the assistance of the East Asian nations that have been invaded, thereby strengthening its momentum.

No matter how the future war situation develops, the closer the enemy approaches Japan, the more severe the blows they will inevitably suffer, the greater the price they will pay, and the more difficulties they will encounter. The isolated forces that penetrate deep into the country may even be completely annihilated. This is worth noting.

Today is the 40th Japanese Navy Day. In addition to expressing our infinite respect for the glorious history of the Allied Navy, we also firmly believe that in the future decisive naval battle, the Allied forces will surely establish even greater achievements than in the past, and bring the Greater East Asia War to a final victory!

### Commanding from the Bridge: The Glorious Tradition of the Japanese Navy

"How many hours have passed since the warship left the base?" the commander on the bridge thought absently. Mealtime had already passed. It was said that he had little time to sleep, simply leaning back in his chair in his uniform. But he wasn't as young as I was. Although his face was tanned red and black, he was quite old. If I were to stand for an hour or two, my legs would ache. How many hours would the commander have to stand? Regardless of whether the enemy came or not, he was always facing the sky, looking for enemy traces, and watching the sea, guarding against the appearance of submarines. He stood silently like that. Even the watchmen had rotating shifts, but there was no one to relieve the commander. And to constantly guide the pursuing warship, deciding direction and speed. How arduous and meritorious this was! Despite such hardship, the commander stood on the front lines like a bronze statue. This spirit of absolute responsibility is truly awe-inspiring."

This is what a reporter who recently returned from the bloody battlefield said. "The commander standing motionless like a bronze statue…" As we face the 40th Navy Day, gazing at the smoke-filled Pacific Ocean, the 100 million citizens must all burn with the same hatred and determination as the commander. History has told us, and has taught us.

### Moving Lines of Poetry

"The Admiral Standing on the Bridge" is the most moving line of poetry for us. The protagonist in songs such as "The Brave Sailor's Song" and "The Still Living Zhenyuan" (定遠號), Third Class Seaman Miura, died in battle during the Sino-Japanese War of 1894-1895. Commander Ito, who completely defeated Ding Ruchang's Beiyang Fleet in the Yellow Sea decisive battle, also stood steadfast on the bridge of the flagship Matsushima amidst the hail of bullets.

The calm and composed demeanor of Commander Togo in the painting "Bridge of the Mikasa" depicting the Battle of Tsushima truly expresses the spirit of "the rise and fall of the island nation hinges on this battle," and truly reflects the spirit of "only with a country can there be a home." Furthermore, Marshal Yamamoto Isoroku, wearing the most glorious badge for wounded soldiers, with his left hand wrapped in a snow-white glove holding a saber, and the famous Marshal Koga Mineichi, we can all imagine that they were always standing on the bridge like bronze statues.

Commander Yamaguchi and Captain Kaku, who sang praises of Marshal Yamamoto, "Our Japanese admirals standing amidst the smoke and fire on the bridge," all stood on the bridge commanding, spending the long nights on the Pacific Ocean, watching the faint moon with their staff in silence. This posture is a sublime beauty only seen in sacred office. Furthermore, on the burning warship, Vice Admiral Yanagimoto, bearing his wounds, continued to give his final orders from the signal platform, gradually disappearing into the ocean like a god in the flames. He was still "commanding from the bridge" at the moment of his death, inspiring endless admiration in us.

### The Meaning of Commanding from the Bridge

The captain of a ship, the commander of a fleet, or the commander of an entire fleet, all stand at the front of the most dangerous warship. In April of the spring of Showa 16 (1941), when local officials participating in the upcoming pilgrimage to the capital were invited to visit a certain flagship at Yokosuka Naval Port, a certain prefectural governor asked:

"The commander-in-chief is always on the flagship targeted by enemy bullets, especially standing on the most dangerous bridge. From the perspective of the overall situation, is this correct?"

Admiral Yamamoto calmly replied: "This is a naval tradition upheld by generations of commanders since the Yellow Sea naval battle in the Sino-Japanese War."

This prefectural governor's question was by no means unreasonable. If the commander-in-chief were to make a mistake, wouldn't it affect the entire situation? However, the so-called "if there were a mistake" is something that the Japanese Navy would absolutely not encounter. Before one's own death, always strike down the enemy first. The fierce fighting spirit contained in this "commanding from the bridge" is precisely the "victory is assured, attack is certain" glorious achievements in our Japanese naval war history.

### Marshal Togo's Spirit

On the eve of the Battle of Tsushima, the base of the Japanese Combined Fleet was moved to the Inland Sea islands. Soon after, the No. 48艇 of the 大島 (Ōshima) and the cruiser Miyako struck mines and sank. The "Yoshino" collided with the "Kasuga" while returning to base from outside Port Arthur and sank. In addition, the battleships Hatsuse and Yashima sank after striking mines while blockading Port Arthur. This series of unfortunate events, especially the loss of the Hatsuse and Yashima, two of the six main battleships, was a major blow to the navy at the time. Even the Japanese fleet's officers and soldiers were somewhat discouraged. At this time, there was a loud sound of footsteps on the deck behind the flagship Mikasa. It was Marshal Togo, with a smile on his kind face. Honestly speaking, what saved the Japanese Navy from its greatest crisis during the Russo-Japanese War was the eternal smile of Marshal Togo standing on the bridge.

One day in Showa 8 (1933), Dr. Matsunami Niichiro visited Marshal Togo and said, "You are very old (87 years old). Can you still command a large fleet in battle?" The Marshal replied, "My legs are not good. It is difficult to go up and down the bridge." Dr. Matsunami then asked the Marshal, "If someone helps you up to the bridge, can you still command in battle?" The Marshal's reply was powerful: "That I can!" Upon hearing these words, Dr. Matsunami immediately ran to the Navy Ministry and requested to see Navy Minister Osumi Mineo. He told the Navy Minister every detail of his conversation with Marshal Togo. Upon hearing that Marshal Togo could still command the Combined Fleet, Minister Osumi said, "Thank you!" He immediately convened the Navy Ministry's key officers and said, "I want to tell you all about Dr. Matsunami's conversation with Marshal Togo just now. What is most touching is that a person as old as the Marshal can still command a large fleet in battle." The listeners were greatly moved and immediately issued a notice to each fleet.

The heroic spirit of being able to command in battle on the bridge at the age of 87, the spirit that was used to defeat the enemy 39 years ago in the Battle of Tsushima, and to establish Japan's eternal national foundation in one battle. Now, Japan's naval warriors are as numerous as the clouds, and they will surely quell the raging waves of the Pacific Ocean.

### Always in Battle

A reporter from the Turaqi night raid wrote down the following facts.

The night raid tactics and exercises are indistinguishable. The bridge is always quiet. The daily routine of "each to their post" is the same. There is no excitement anywhere. In the blink of an eye, a world-shaking decisive battle will occur, yet no waves are stirred on the hearts of the soldiers. It's as if the bridge is made of steel; there's utter silence. I will never forget this night sea battle. The sailors wholeheartedly swab the deck. Their posture is no different from usual. What is most admirable is that they still carry out their daily tasks as usual afterwards. This is deeply imprinted on my heart.

After winning the Battle of Tsushima, Marshal Togo ordered his subordinates on the way back to Sasebo, "Let's conduct combat training!" The meaning of Marshal Yamamoto's "always on the battlefield" and Marshal Koga's "constant battle" were also clearly recorded by this reporter for the first time. Riding the sirocco blowing from Arabia and sailing across the raging waves of the Indian Ocean, just as shown in the movie "The Silent Victory," the countless victories gained since the beginning of the Greater East Asia War can all be attributed to the "bridge command" established by the commanders.

### Commemorative Allied Navy Day First Speech Yesterday Sponsored by the Shanghai Branch of the News Association

Today (the 27th) is the 40th Allied Japanese Navy Day. To commemorate it, the Shanghai Branch of the China News Association held a speech meeting yesterday (the 26th) at 5:00 PM at the Grand Theatre. Colonel Matsushima, the reporting director of the Japanese Fleet stationed in China, was invited to give the speech. Colonel Matsushima, along with Lieutenant Matsumoto, Lieutenant Hirata, and others, attended on time. Chen Binhe, the chairman of the Shanghai Branch of the News Association, and Osaka Yoichi, the executive director, were also present. First, Chairman Chen Binhe delivered a speech and invited Colonel Matsushima to speak (the speech can be found on the first page), lasting thirty minutes. Then, the Shanghai Light Music Troupe played music, Miss Mizuhara sang, Mr. Takatori sang a solo, and Miss Fujieda performed a piano solo. The Hua Ying famous film "Ten Thousand Households Renewed" was also screened. The event ended at 7:30 PM.

Chairman's Speech

Chairman Chen Binhe said in his speech: "Today, May 27th, is the 40th anniversary of the Allied Japanese Navy Day. The Shanghai Branch of the China News Association is holding this speech meeting to commemorate it, and we have invited Colonel Matsushima, the reporting director of the Allied Fleet, to speak.

As you all know, Japanese Navy Day commemorates the Japanese Navy's surprise victory over the Imperial Russian Fleet in the Battle of Tsushima under the leadership of Marshal Togo during the Russo-Japanese War forty years ago. This not only laid the foundation for the victory of the Russo-Japanese War but also established the excellent tradition of the Japanese Navy's spirit. Over the past forty years, especially in the Greater East Asia War, the Japanese Navy's brave attacks against the enemy have been a full expression of the naval spirit. Naval military strategies may differ between now and then, but the traditional spirit of the Japanese Navy remains the same. This is a point worth recognizing when commemorating Navy Day today."

Second Speech

The Shanghai Branch of the News Association will also host a speech meeting for students from major middle schools in the city at 10:00 AM today (the 27th) at the Dahua Theatre. Lieutenant General Jiang Xiyuan, the principal of the Central Naval Academy, will be invited to speak.

### Governor Ren Visits Shanghai, Hosting a Banquet for Leaders from All Walks of Life, Thanking Shanghai for Organizing Jiangsu Agricultural Loans

Governor Ren of Jiangsu Province, in order to express his gratitude for the Shanghai Municipal Government and the business and financial communities organizing agricultural loans for Jiangsu, visited Shanghai the other day to meet with relevant parties. Last night, he hosted a banquet at 2 Xianyang Road, inviting officials from the Municipal Government, the agricultural loan committee of the Municipal Advisory Committee, and various personnel related to the agricultural loan syndicate. Those present included Secretary-General Luo of the Municipal Government and heads of various bureaus and departments, Zhou Zuomin, Tang Shoumin, Wu Zhenxiu, Qian Dalou, Li Sihao, Wen Lanting, Lin Kanghou, Yuan Ludeng, Sun Yaodong, Liu Ruxiang, Zhu Rutang, Dai Ailu, Ye Fuxiao, Wu Yong'an, Xiang Kangyuan, Zhao Zhengping, Zhang Rongchu, Zhang Ruitang, Tong Lvqing, Chen Riping, Jin Xiongbo, and others. From the Japanese side, Councillor Okazaki from the Embassy, Department Chief Kaneko from the Jiangsu Liaison Department, and experts Nasu, Watanabe, Inoue from the Flour and Wheat Association, and Ueda from the Rice Control Association were present. Governor Ren, along with Director Pei of the Finance Department, Director Sun of the Construction Department, Director Ren of the Bank, and others, personally hosted the event. In total, there were approximately eighty guests from both China and Japan.

Governor Ren's Speech

During the banquet, Governor Ren gave a speech, stating that the relationship between Shanghai and Jiangsu Province is becoming increasingly close. This time, the Municipal Advisory Committee proposed organizing agricultural loans for Jiangsu, and the Municipal Government and the business and financial communities fully facilitated it. He would like to express his gratitude on behalf of the farmers of Jiangsu Province. Before that, Mr. Yuan Ludeng, Mr. Chen Riping, Mr. Xiang Kangyuan, and other gentlemen from the Shanghai business community visited Jiangsu Province and personally inspected the Dongting West Mountain. They did not hesitate to travel to develop the region, and their enthusiasm is commendable. Shanghai's grain problem is of great concern to Jiangsu Province. In the close relationship, we should cooperate to solve it. With the success of this agricultural loan, we will certainly do our best to cooperate to meet the expectations of all sectors in Shanghai.

Secretary-General Luo then gave a speech, stating that the food problem has always been the most serious livelihood problem in Shanghai, and it is currently even more serious. The solution requires the joint efforts of all parties, especially the practical help of Jiangsu Province. Shanghai's agricultural loans directly help farmers in Jiangsu Province, and indirectly, it is also for its own sake. Therefore, the Municipal Government will do its best to facilitate it. Finally, Mr. Li Sihao, Chairman of the Agricultural Loan Syndicate Committee, delivered a speech, elaborating on the significance of the agricultural loan and expressing his gratitude for the sincere assistance of the Jiangsu Province authorities.

Furthermore, Governor Ren's banquet featured simple dishes, fully complying with the spirit of frugality. The atmosphere was harmonious and cheerful, which was a characteristic of the banquet.

### Acting Director Liu of the Economic Bureau Takes Office at the Beginning of Next Month

Xu Jiang, the Director of the Municipal Economic Bureau, was approved to resign for war reasons. Liu Xingchen, the Director of the Municipal Goods Allocation Office, was appointed as the acting director. The bureau has now ordered all departments to complete the handover preparations. It is said that Acting Director Liu will take office at the beginning of June. As for the cancellation of the Municipal Goods Allocation Office, it will also be announced on the same day. All future household allocation matters will be handled by a department established within the Economic Bureau.

Relocation of Three Issuance Offices

In order to facilitate the issuance of certificates to residents in the Nanshi area, the Municipal Goods Allocation Office originally established the 17th, 18th, and 19th Issuance Offices at the original site of the Grain Bureau. They were responsible for issuing household allocation certificates for the Yimiao, Pengpu, and Xieqiao households. Now, because the main building of the Grain Bureau has other uses, the 17th Issuance Office has been moved to the Homeless Labor Camp on Penglai Road, which was formerly the relief center. The 18th Issuance Office has been moved to the downstairs of the Grain Bureau dormitory building, and the 19th Issuance Office has been moved to 171 Zhaozhou Road, Nanyang Bridge Police Station. All have been completed and are open for business. It is also learned that the First Issuance Office, originally located at the Racecourse, has now been returned to the Yunnan Road Renji Shantang Office, and the Second Issuance Office has also moved to Gordon Road to work in the same location as the Third Issuance Office.

Allocation Items Exempt from Transit Tax

When the Municipal Goods Allocation Office transported items such as fertilizer, soap, and matches to the residents of the north and south districts of Pudong, they had to declare and pay taxes, which affected the allocation price and delayed the time. The office has specifically submitted a request to the Municipal Government to request the customs authorities to waive the transit tax. The Municipal Government has submitted the request to the Ministry of Finance to be forwarded to the Jianghai Customs for exemption.

### Factory Licenses are Issued by the Construction Bureau, Those Registered with the Economic Bureau Must Still Apply

In the past, factories in the jurisdiction of this city were managed by the factory division of the former Public Works Bureau. After the Public Works Bureau merged into the Construction Bureau, the factory licenses were issued by the Construction Bureau. Subsequently, factories in the city, whether in urban or suburban areas, with ten or more workers, or equipped with boilers or power machinery, must apply to the Second Section of the Construction Bureau on Hankou Road in accordance with the regulations. Even those who have already obtained a factory registration certificate from the Economic Bureau must still obtain a factory license to ensure industrial safety and increase production efficiency.

Vehicle Registration Certificate for Entry and Exit

The Municipal Construction Bureau believes that vehicle theft incidents often occur when citizens go to vehicle registration offices in various districts to register their vehicles. In order to prevent this, it has decided that each registration office will issue a special vehicle entry and exit certificate. It is stipulated that in the future, vehicles going for registration must enter and exit with the entry and exit certificate. Otherwise, if it is found that there is no entry and exit certificate, the theft of the vehicle will be investigated.

Shanghai Military Vehicles Limited to Military Personnel

The Municipal Construction Bureau believes that the Shanghai Military vehicle license plates were originally special license plates for use by the local defense forces. Recently, it has been reported that some vehicles with Shanghai Military license plates have women riding in them, are parked in entertainment venues, or are even used to transport goods. These should be corrected separately to rectify the situation. It is now stipulated that only military personnel, military dependents, and those wearing uniforms can ride in vehicles with Shanghai Military license plates. A request has been submitted to the Municipal Government to instruct the military agencies in the city to pay attention to this at any time, and a letter has been sent to the Shanghai Special City Liaison Department to contact the relevant parties.

### Japan Decides to Cooperate with China to Achieve Independence and Sovereignty

After attending the Liaison Conference of Ambassadors to China held by the Greater East Asia Ministry, Minister Tsuchida returned to his post in China on the 24th. On the afternoon of the 26th, at 2:30 PM, he delivered a speech to the embassy staff in the embassy conference room, reporting on the conference and the opinions of the Japanese government. The gist of his speech stated: The current situation is extremely serious. In view of the trend of the war and the changes in the international situation, Japan is clearly facing a difficult situation. In order to achieve the goals of the war and adhere to the determination to carry out the war, the government and the command are closely integrated to promote policies. The China issue has become increasingly important. However, Japan's policy toward China will never change. The Japanese government is now cooperating with China to complete its unification and its independent sovereignty, and is making every effort to establish friendly relations based on equality and mutual benefit, overcoming all obstacles. All of this depends on the efforts of everyone. Regarding the operation of various economic policies, we will resolutely abide by the purpose of the Outline of Countermeasures for Establishing a Wartime Economy in China, strive for development, and proceed with the unified cooperation of the garrison authorities, in order to live up to the expectations of the country.

### Old Zhabei Police Station Intensifies Night Patrols

The Old Zhabei Branch of the Police Bureau began implementing night patrols on the 25th of this month. When the team patrolled near Fuzhou Road at 4:30 AM, they captured a cigarette theft suspect named Wang Zhenhou. According to his confession, the cigarettes were stolen from a cigarette shop at 264 Tianjin Road. Subsequently, they also seized 72 boxes of cigarettes at 15 Shudeli, Zihua Road in the Nanshi area, and arrested three suspected accomplices, including Zhang Daliang, in room 221 of the Daxin Inn on Guangxi Road. The details are still under close investigation. The first day of night patrols resulted in a theft case, and investigations are now being intensified.

### Ice Vendors Manipulate Market Prices, Should Be Banned

The machine-made ice necessary for the city's ice and seafood industry was previously produced by more than ten factories. However, since electricity was restricted, the factories were affected and closed down one after another. Today, only Qia He and Qia Mao remain. Since the beginning of summer, the demand for ice has been extremely high for the ice and seafood industry, as well as restaurants and other shops. This has led intermediaries (i.e., general ice vendors) to manipulate the market, pushing prices up to 135,000 yuan per ton. In addition, ice stalls and vendors are required to pay tips if they want to open an account to purchase directly. It is hoped that the authorities will severely crack down on these manipulators.

### Commemorating Japanese Navy Day, Understanding the Spirit of the Japanese Navy: City Propaganda Office Broadcast Yesterday

The City Propaganda Office held a broadcast lecture yesterday in commemoration of the 40th anniversary of the Allied Japanese Navy Day, which stated:

"Commemorating Japanese Navy Day, we must first recognize the great spirit of the Japanese Navy, past and present. During the war between Japan and Imperial Russia, Marshal Togo, with both courage and wisdom, completely destroyed the fleet of Imperial Russia, astonishing the world. Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the Japanese Navy has relied on its three excellent qualities: first, its strong fighting spirit; second, its unwavering belief in victory; and third, its innovative and clever scientific power, causing unprecedented damage to Britain and the United States.

This year, in order to seize naval and air supremacy, Britain and the United States have launched continuous attacks on Luzon Island, Iwo Jima, the waters near Japan, and Okinawa Island. The Japanese Navy is determined to inherit the immortal historical achievements left by its predecessors in the Battle of the Sea of Japan, to be mindful of the many past difficulties, to cope with the enemy's operations, to make the destruction of the enemy the key to victory, and to maintain a calm and unwavering posture in the face of danger.

The necessary victory of the Greater East Asia War and the liberation of the East Asian peoples make it impossible for us not to admire the power of the Japanese Navy and the brave and sacrificial fighting spirit of its naval officers and soldiers."

### Suppression of Unhealthy Publications

In order to actively handle the suppression of unhealthy publications for the public, the Municipal Education Bureau convened a discussion meeting yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM in the auditorium of the Municipal Yucai Middle School, gathering representatives from various bookstores in the city. More than 30 representatives from bookstores such as Commercial Press, Zhonghua, World, Datong, Dazhong, and Guangyi attended. Director Dai presided over the meeting in person, explaining the significance of the suppression work and the preparations that had been made, and providing guidance on the direction of improvement. Regarding the publication of publications for the public, he deeply hoped that all publishers would pay close attention in advance.

### Two Police Officers Executed for Extorting People's Property: Shot to Death in the Racecourse This Morning

The case of police officers Li Hongxin and Du Zhiping of the Huashan Road Branch of the Police Bureau, who extorted people's property, has been concluded by the Special Court Shanghai Branch. The two defendants, Li and Du, were each sentenced to death. The sentence was approved by Chairman Chen of the National Government in Thailand and was scheduled to be executed by shooting at 9:00 AM today (the 27th) in the Racecourse Square. The original text of the judgment is recorded below:

Judgment of the Shanghai Branch of the Special Court of the National Government, No. 6 of the Special Character 34. Defendant Li Hongxin, male, 21 years old, from Yancheng, resident of 3479 Changshou Road, occupation: police officer; Du Zhiping, male, 24 years old, from Shandong, resident of Huashan Police Branch, occupation: police officer. The right defendants were handed over to this court by order of the National Government for a case of extorting people's property. The judgment is as follows:

Main Text

Li Hongxin and Du Zhiping, acting jointly, intentionally sought illegal gains, used their power, and extorted people's property through violence and coercion. Each is sentenced to death and fined 50,000 yuan, and deprived of public rights for life. If the fine cannot be paid, it will be converted into labor service based on the ratio of the total fine to the number of days in six months. The illegal gains of 70,000 yuan will be confiscated.

Facts

Li Hongxin and Du Zhiping are both police officers of the Huashan Police Branch in this city. At 5:00 AM on April 5th of this year, wearing uniforms, they, together with Zhai Suozeng, a police officer who had been dismissed from the bureau, and Gu Weiliang, who is at large, set up a name of checking pedestrians' residences at the intersection of Yuguo Road and Jiangsu Road, seeking illegal gains. Subsequently, Chen Gencai, a pedestrian carrying a net bag, was walking alone, passing through the area. Li Hongxin first ordered him to stop and shouted to Zhai Suozeng as "Team Leader Wang," and stepped forward to ask for his residence certificate. Chen Gencai showed a damaged city resident certificate. They used this as an excuse to pretend to take him to the police station, urging him to walk towards Jiangsu Road. When they reached the wasteland of Dongzhu'anbang, they suddenly stopped. Du Zhiping and Zhai Suozeng searched him but found nothing. Then, they found 70,000 yuan in cash in the net bag. Zhai Suozeng handed it over to Li Hongxin, who then handed it over to Gu Weiliang. Using the pretext of making a fake phone call, they urged the two to take the money and flee. Chen Gencai, seeing that the money had been taken, followed Du Zhiping and Zhai Suozeng closely. Seeing that they could not be deceived, Zhai Suozeng found Gu Weiliang and escorted Chen Gencai eastward. When they reached Meijia Bridge, Gu Weiliang pushed him into the small river and fled in different directions. Chen Gencai reported the incident to the branch, which arrested them and reported it to the mayor of the city, who reported it to the National Government, which ordered this court to hear the case.

Reasons

The defendants are incumbent police officers and are responsible for maintaining local public order. They should cherish their reputation and serve as an example. However, they used their authority to check residence permits and escorted the victim to a remote location, where they conducted a search and ultimately extorted property through violence and coercion. After reviewing the circumstances of the crime, it is unpardonable. They should each be sentenced to the maximum penalty to maintain law and order and serve as a warning for the future. The illegal gains of 70,000 yuan will be confiscated in accordance with the law.

### Yuyou Road Fire Relief Association Plans to Build a Public Housing Village

Needs Huge Funds, Continued Fundraising for One Week

The unprecedented fire on Yuyou Road in Shanghai West caused huge losses and left thousands of victims destitute and in distress, which is very tragic. Previously, people in the area launched and organized a temporary relief committee to handle relief work, such as burying the dead, treating the injured, and working with various charitable organizations to provide porridge and other tasks. This continued for more than ten days, and the victims benefited greatly. The emergency relief work has now come to an end, and the housing problem, which is a real need for the victims, needs to be resolved urgently. Therefore, an expanded organization of the temporary relief committee was convened at the Tingyue Restaurant at 4:00 PM on the 25th to achieve greater effectiveness. Chen Binhe, Lin Kanghou, Gu Jiwu, and other 30 people attended. Chairman Dai Aiying gave an opening speech, followed by Le Fenglin and Wu Songquan reporting on the details of the fire and the handling process. Then, the organization of the committee was discussed. Wen Lanting, Yan Huiqing, Li Sihao, Yuan Ludeng, and other eleven people were publicly elected as honorary members; Dai Ailu, Shen Siliang, Pang Zhe, Zhu Shunlin, Ju Mengbai, Yang Jingbing, Le Fenglin, and other seven people were elected as standing committee members; Fan Yifeng, Xue Hongkun, Tong Luqing, Yan Qingling, Wu Songquan, Yuan Jiping, Xian Zhang, Qian Zong, Zhu Wenyue, Le Boming, and other twenty-four people were elected as members; Ye Fuxiao, Zhang Deqin, and Yao Benyuan were elected as economic management committee members. The following motions were discussed:

Mr. Chen Binhe proposed that the Shenbao had received donations of over 18 million yuan and hoped that the association would prepare a letter to withdraw the funds for use. Resolved: The emergency relief work in the disaster area has been completed, and in the future, real relief will require huge funds. Please ask Shenxin and Liangbao to continue fundraising for one week to achieve greater effectiveness. Mr. Lin Kanghou proposed that the fundamental solution to disaster relief can be divided into two points: one is to provide a place for the victims to live, and the other is to eliminate future troubles. Therefore, it is urgently needed to build a rationalized public housing village. Resolved: In addition to expanding fundraising, join forces with other charitable organizations to plan the construction.

Mr. Zhou Mengbai proposed to submit a request for assistance from the Advisory Committee and relevant authorities, and to send letters to various charitable organizations to cooperate in relief efforts. Resolved: It should be done immediately, and donation books should be printed and actively promoted, and many other motions were resolved, all of which were handed over to the Standing Committee for handling.

Red Swastika Society Handles Emergency Relief

The Red Swastika Society has repeatedly sent personnel to investigate the disastrous fire on Yuyou Road in order to seek truth from facts. After consulting with the Lianbao Jia chiefs in the area, the poorest households among the victims were selected for emergency relief. Yesterday, 67 people from the poorest households in the fifth Bao of the sixth Lianbao were given 5,000 yuan in savings certificates per person, totaling 335,000 yuan. In addition, the poorest households in each Bao will continue to be granted emergency relief after the Lianbao Jia chiefs in the area verify and open a list. As for the housing problem for the victims, the Lianbao chief is now uniformly allocating housing, allowing various charitable organizations and philanthropists to bear the construction as much as possible. It is reported that the labor and materials for each house cost about 500,000 yuan in Central Reserve Certificates. The Swastika Society plans to assume responsibility for building twelve houses for the victims to live in and is actively raising funds.

Our Office Will Continue to Collect Donations for Another Week

This office has approved the Yuyou Road Fire Relief Committee's request to continue collecting donations for another week. Relief is our duty, and we cannot refuse. We will continue to collect donations for another week, from May 27th to June 2nd. We still ask all sectors to enthusiastically contribute and share the same feelings.

### Airborne Troops in Modern Warfare

— Junmin

The Japanese General Headquarters announced at 4:30 PM on May 25 that the "Giretsu Airborne Unit," a special army attack unit, forcibly landed at the northern and central airfields of Okinawa Island on the 24th, taking advantage of the moonlight to destroy enemy US military supply warehouses and battlefield facilities. At the same time, the Japanese special attack flying units also provided support from the side, fiercely attacking enemy US warships around Okinawa Island. How the Japanese army, with its entire force transformed into special attack units, fought and assisted in the war is not the focus. Although the details of the achievements obtained this time have not been announced immediately, according to the announcement of the Japanese General Headquarters, the former has caused great confusion to the enemy forces, while the latter is continuing to attack. From this, we can see the profound significance. In the near future, the details will be announced to the world by the Japanese General Headquarters. As for the impact, it will be manifested in the decisive battle between Japan and the United States centered on Okinawa Island. The fierce attack of the Japanese special attack units is a tactic to accumulate factors for the victory of the Greater East Asia War, which is worthy of our attention.

### The Truth About Airborne Troops

Airborne troops, as the name suggests, are units transported to the airspace over enemy strongholds in large passenger planes that can carry 20 to 50 people, and then parachute down. Sometimes, they are transported by glider. Two or three gliders are towed by a large plane, flying over enemy strongholds, and then released separately for a group landing. Judging from the above situation alone, it seems no different from an airborne infantry unit. However, their weapons are different from those used by infantry, being smaller and more sophisticated. Most airborne troops carry extremely sophisticated small machine guns, as well as small mortars. In large-scale airborne operations, gliders are used to transport tanks, motorcycles, etc., so the mobility and combat power after landing are great. Their attacks are fierce and powerful, which cannot be compared to simple infantry. In addition, before landing, they conduct thorough reconnaissance from the air or ground, selecting places where the enemy's defenses are weak or easiest to attack. Therefore, unlike ground troops, they can greatly limit the enemy's ability to exert its combat power. Suddenly descending from the sky, while the enemy is caught off guard, they rely on their high mobility to launch a preemptive strike, breaking down the enemy one by one before they can concentrate their forces, and achieving great results.

In this operation of the Giretsu Airborne Unit, roughly one part landed in the mountains near the airfield, attacking the enemy's supplies and aircraft hangars, while another part landed in the center of the airfield. Before the enemy's heavy weapons defending the airfield could open fire, they stopped its activities, so they were able to successfully destroy various military facilities and burn the planes parked on the ground after landing.

### The Truth About Modern Air Warfare

It is an undeniable fact that airplanes are the main weapons of today's war. The Japanese army and navy achieved unprecedented victories in the Greater East Asia War, and the driving force behind this was the strength of the air force. The main reason for Germany's failure in Europe can be attributed to the inferiority of its air force. From this, it can be seen that the rise and fall of air power determine the victory or defeat of modern warfare.

The enemy is certainly aware of this. Having achieved unexpected success in air attacks against Germany, they boasted that they were prepared to apply the same tactics to the Pacific War. In fact, the situation in Europe is completely different from that in the Pacific, so it will be difficult for Britain and the United States to achieve their wishes. However, it is necessary to review the tactics used by the enemy in Europe, especially today, when the European war has come to an end. It is expected that the first thing that will be transferred to the East Asian theater will be air power. Let us take a look at the situation of air combat in the European war, focusing on the United States.

### Peculiarities of the Japanese Paratrooper Corps

The most peculiar characteristic of the Japanese paratrooper corps is its possession of the "Kamikaze" spirit, disregarding survival.

Paratroopers, landing far from friendly lines in enemy territory, are naturally unafraid of death; this is true for paratroopers of any nation. Japanese paratroopers are, of course, even more unafraid of death. They possess the so-called "divine soldier" spirit of not hesitating to die to see a mission through. However, sacrificing life is not the objective, but a means to accomplish the mission. When those who disregard life and death fight desperately, their achievement will naturally be the best possible result from human effort. After landing at the North and Central airfields under American occupation on Okinawa Island, until their valiant deaths, the Giretsu Airborne Unit would do its utmost to blow up enemy aircraft, destroy facilities, and kill personnel, using all ammunition carried to achieve the greatest possible results. Therefore, their achievements will be unprecedented and brilliant, and the damage inflicted on the enemy will not be limited to material and personnel; it is believed to be significant psychologically as well.

### Lessons of the European War: The Number of Enemy Air Forces

The organized air raids by British and American forces against Germany only became truly significant around February of last year. At the beginning of that year, the enemy's air strength in Europe consisted of 5,700 American aircraft and 8,400 British aircraft, totaling 14,100. By the time of the landing in northern France, American aircraft had increased to 10,000, while British aircraft numbered 8,900, totaling 18,900 (the air strength concentrated in the British Isles alone amounted to 11,000), while the German side had only over 9,000. With such an overwhelming absolute advantage, the British and American invasion operations in Europe were able to unfold favorably. The British and American air forces conducted fierce bombing raids on German positions, railways, factories, airfields, and major cities in northern France and southwestern Germany, weakening German mobility. After half a year of such combat, they were able to break into the German mainland.

In the battles near the German-French border, the British and American air forces repeatedly used large formations of approximately one thousand bombers to carry out a kind of "carpet bombing," dropping large quantities of bombs all at once, destroying everything in the target area. Since this year, the bombing of Germany has intensified even further. It is said that around the time the British and American forces crossed the Rhine in March, they were deploying more than three thousand aircraft per day.

### The Quality of Enemy Air Forces

The aircraft used in the bombing of Germany included American B-17s (Flying Fortresses) and B-24s (Liberators), while British forces recently used Lancaster bombers, all of which were four-engine heavy bombers. Among these, B-17s and B-24s also appeared frequently in the Greater East Asia War theater and became opponents of the Japanese Air Force.

The bombs used initially in the European war were around half a ton in weight, but by the end of last year, British Lancaster aircraft began using 6-ton "Ask Erk" bombs, and around the time of the Rhine crossing, they were using 11-ton "Vulcan" bombs to bomb transportation facilities and other strategic points. The payload capacity of Lancaster heavy bombers seems to be the largest today.

On the other hand, heavy fighter planes also carried small bombs to carry out bombing at high speeds. American P-38 formations also frequently attacked German ground troops.

As for the method of dropping bombs, they were not simply released to fall naturally under gravity, but also used rocket-assisted bombs, hoping to add artificial thrust to the gravitational force, thereby increasing the effectiveness of the bombs and achieving greater results. It is said that it was this type of rocket-assisted bomb that destroyed the thick walls of German submarine pens on the European coast. Thus, the application of rocket principles tends to become more widespread. In order to counter the German Messerschmitt jet fighters, the enemy announced that the United States was testing the Sikorsky jet aircraft, and Britain also had the De Havilland 2 jet aircraft, but these high-speed aircraft had not yet been practically applied in the European war.

### Enemy Air Strategy

In the early days of military aircraft usage, the general strategic thinking regarding air power was to use a large-scale air force to strike the enemy's heartland in one fell swoop at the beginning of the war, in order to quickly end the war. The strategic theory advocated by Italian General Douhet during the previous Great War was of this type. However, this is an ideal scenario. In actual warfare, because the enemy also possesses a strong air force, it is necessary to first engage in a decisive air battle, defeat the opponent, and gain air supremacy before being able to bomb the enemy's center. The representative of this line of thinking is British General Groves. Therefore, the British Air Force devoted considerable effort to strengthening the fighter squadrons that were powerful elements in decisive air battles. This is why they were able to cope with the German Air Force's bombing of the British Isles after the fall of France, and why the British forces were able to achieve victory in the North African campaign. The American Air Force also adopted this strategy. Since January of last year, it has established joint air force organizations worldwide based on British top-tier air force strategy, dividing air units into tactical air forces and strategic air forces. Tactical air forces focus on destroying enemy air power and assisting ground operations, specifically attacking the enemy's existing military strength. Strategic air forces, on the other hand, focus on attacking enemy rear transportation facilities, munitions factories, major cities, and other wartime strategic points, i.e., potential war-making capabilities. In other words, the former aims at striking the enemy's existing military strength, while the latter threatens the potential war-making capabilities that are the source of that strength. The two support each other to consume the opponent's strength.

Here is an example of the effect of strategic bombing. According to Ralph K. Davis, Deputy Director of the U.S. Petroleum Administration for War, in a statement made in Washington on May 6, in the past year, British and American air forces carried out 270 air strikes on German oil refineries and other petroleum production facilities, dropping nearly 100,000 tons of bombs, causing a shortage of fuel for the German military. Their tanks and air forces were thus greatly impacted.

### The Destiny of Japan

According to enemy propaganda, the material and human resources used by the enemy, the U.S., and Britain, in the war against Germany will be transferred to East Asia after the end of the war in Europe. This is not mere propaganda but an actual matter, and a predictable development. In particular, easily transportable aircraft and some of the air personnel could be deployed to the East Asian theater within a few weeks. This can be easily foreseen, considering the enemy's current losses.

Recently, according to a military expert's paper, due to shipping and distance relationships, the enemy forces that the U.S. and Britain could transport to the East Asian theater by April or May of next year would be approximately double the existing forces, or two million. However, these are only the forces that can be transferred to East Asia. As for troops with sufficient combat capability, due to shipping and port constraints, and difficulties in transporting military supplies, it would only be around 500,000 men. Based on this, it is too early to say that a landing operation on the Japanese mainland is impossible. Even a landing operation along the Chinese coast may not be as easy as the enemy claims. However, it would be premature to conclude from this that Japan is bound to win. The enemy, the U.S., and Britain will transfer many of the B-24s and other medium bombers used in the European strategic bombing campaign to the East Asian theater, using islands near the Japanese mainland such as Iwo Jima and Okinawa as bases, and intensify air operations, carrying out indiscriminate bombing of Japanese cities to weaken Japan's munitions production capacity and make it unable to resist. In addition, the enemy will adopt a strategy of isolating the Japanese mainland, deploying aircraft to drop mines and obstruct Japanese maritime transport. However, for Japan, securing islands near the mainland and the Chinese mainland is the most important factor for victory.

Securing all the land suitable for establishing air bases is a very large undertaking and difficult to achieve. Moreover, even if it is possible to occupy them and accumulate military supplies there, due to the activities of paratrooper units, aircraft can be used at any time to land in key enemy locations, so the possibility of recapturing or destroying them is high. The astonishing feat of the Japanese Giretsu Airborne Unit this time, in this sense, can truly influence the East Asian war situation, and its results and impact are worthy of serious consideration.

### Japanese Naval General Headquarters

The war on Okinawa Island is intensifying and finally facing the final decisive stage. Therefore, the Navy, in order to adapt to the war situation, is undertaking a major reform, namely, deciding to establish the Naval General Headquarters. The strength of the naval operational forces, including surface forces, air forces, special attack forces, and base combat forces, is an extremely complex organization. However, the significance of establishing the Naval General Headquarters lies in the unification of all naval forces and their effective command, taking charge of the various fleets under the Combined Fleet, the naval districts, naval stations, and all units and bases belonging to the guard districts, as well as the unified command of the main operational units under naval command. In the past, the Commander-in-Chief of the Combined Fleet, in fact, also took on this unified command, but now it is becoming a fixed system, which naturally has great significance.

The Combined Fleet has been a fixed form since the Sino-Japanese War and the Russo-Japanese War. Naval strength was, of course, limited to naval forces, but the current Greater East Asia War has changed the form of maritime operations, transforming them into air operations. As a result, the Combined Fleet has also finally changed its original form, holding fleet air power and base air power. Now, air power has become the main force in maritime operations. Therefore, the components that make up naval strength have become diverse.

At the same time, the battlefield has moved closer to the Japanese mainland, and the bases and units belonging to the naval districts and guard districts have become forces on the front line, participating in counter-enemy operations. In order to adapt to various situations, it is naturally necessary to implement effective unified command of all naval forces. The establishment of the Naval General Headquarters shows that the Navy is waiting for the Commander-in-Chief's decisive use of troops and the determination to annihilate and capture the enemy's naval forces.

It should be particularly pointed out that Admiral Toyoda, a highly respected figure in the Navy, is also serving as the first Commander-in-Chief, so the morale of all soldiers is becoming even more fervent. Therefore, we dare to say that due to this spirit of certain victory, a victorious outcome will be achieved. (Translated from the May 3 Asahi Shimbun)

### Enemy Air Power in the Pacific

The function of air power in the Greater East Asia War has been discussed repeatedly, and there is almost nothing more to say. The sharpest edge of the Japanese Navy, with the naval air force as the vanguard, has launched battles to annihilate enemy naval forces everywhere. The enemy's main axis of island-hopping counter-offensive operations is air power. The decisive battle between Japan and the U.S. around the Japanese mainland will, of course, be conducted in the form of an air battle. The enemy claims that it will use the same methods against Japan that it used against Germany. Can it really do so? Let us examine it daily.

### The Problem of Bases

When the British and American forces entered Europe, they had the British Isles as their base of operations. Unlike the British mainland, which is close to the European continent and can accommodate a large number of troops, the British and American forces have not yet been able to find a base of that kind around the Japanese mainland today. Currently, they only have the Mariana base for using B-29s. Relying solely on this, they cannot carry out effective large-scale attacks. Therefore, the U.S. military has no choice but to look at Okinawa, attempting to acquire that base in order to deploy the B-17s, B-24s, and other medium bombers used in Europe.

### The Problem of Supply

To supply the Mariana bases, they must overcome the distance of nearly 10,000 kilometers from the U.S. mainland. The length of the supply line has an extremely negative impact on operational efficiency.

### The Problem of Aircraft Types

If the aircraft types used in Europe cannot be quickly effective in the war against Japan, then they will have to rely on the B-29. According to the U.S., the monthly production of this large aircraft is only about 200, so it is questionable whether they can launch an aggressive offensive with this. Moreover, even if the air raids are effective, the damage rate is also extremely high.

### The Problem of Strategy

The enemy uses B-29s from the Mariana bases to carry out strategic bombing while using naval air power to destroy Japan's existing military strength. That is, the air power from aircraft carriers takes on the role of tactical air forces in the European war. This creates great difficulties in command and control, and also carries the risk of encountering enormous attrition.

### Air Strategic Posture

The enemy forces attempting to approach the Japanese mainland through air operations face many difficulties, as mentioned above. However, the enemy's position forces it to take on these risks and carry out operations. In the face of such a situation, what about Japan's counter-attack? We know that what is unfavorable to the enemy is favorable to Japan. These are listed below:

First, the Japanese mainland is a vast group of air bases. Today, every place and every corner of the Japanese mainland has been strengthened with air bases and has been completely transformed into an air fortress.

Second, Japan's supply is free and unimpeded. Due to the dispersed deployment of the munitions industry, each part of the Japanese mainland can be self-sufficient, and moreover, behind it are the vast reserve resources of Manchuria and China.

Third, because Japan has adopted a strategy of luring the enemy deep, it does not need to produce a large number of large aircraft like the enemy, but can use small aircraft to achieve the greatest effect. Moreover, the Japanese munitions industry technology is extremely excellent and is able to manufacture good bombs and torpedoes that are far superior to enemy bombs, building great achievements. The enemy's large bombs are not at all fearful.

Fourth, with the above strategic elements as the background, the Japanese military's air tactics are flexible, and the morale of the Japanese military is also soaring. They will surely kill any approaching enemy without leaving them a scrap of armor. The Japanese special attack forces are the flower of these tactics. As for their power, U.S. Pacific Fleet Commander Nimitz praised Japan when he inspected Okinawa in April, saying, "If the special attack forces fly in, we will eventually suffer terrible damage!"

From the above points, the enemy's use of forces from the European theater in the Pacific theater is nothing to be afraid of. Even if they can draw out the remaining 10,000 aircraft, in the fast-paced air war, no effect can be expected. The only thing that can cast a shadow on Japan's air strategic posture, which is sure to win, is the enemy's strategic bombing, which destroys Japan's potential power. However, the Japanese people are now displaying their worth, vigorously replenishing their fighting power under the air raids, and will sink any enemy that attacks in the future to the bottom of the Pacific Ocean. When the enemy's human and material resources are exhausted, the good opportunity for victory will naturally come.

### Brilliant Achievements: The Japanese Navy in the Past Year

In the past year, the development of the Greater East Asia War has been astonishing. The Japanese Navy, in fierce operations, with the special attack forces as the backbone, has repeatedly inflicted extremely heavy damage on the attacking U.S. mobile force. The most famous of these are the following: The Battle of the Mariana Islands, the Battle of Peleliu Island, the Great Air Battle off Taiwan, the Great Air and Sea Battle in the East Sea of the Philippines, the Great Battle of Lingayen Gulf, the Great Battle of Iwo Jima, and the Great Battles off the Southeast Sea of Kyushu and near Okinawa Island.

These seven major battles are the highlights. In each battle, the Japanese naval and air forces cooperated with the army on the islands to carry out fierce fighting tactics. The sacrificial spirit of the special attack forces, with the slogan of "one plane for one ship", caused the enemy mobile forces to suffer enormous losses each time. Nimitz's Third Fleet's Fifth Task Force was shattered and decimated, and it was impossible to replenish it in time.

The details of each major battle in the past year are described separately below:

One. The Battle of the Mariana Islands. June 20 of last year: The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced that enemy forces attacking Saipan Island had seized a corner of the island on the afternoon of June 15 and were gradually increasing their strength. The Japanese garrison forces constantly engaged them, inflicting heavy damage. The enemy appearing near the Mariana Islands was a large mobile force mainly composed of aircraft carriers and battleships. The enemy has now concentrated most of the Pacific Fleet in that area. The Japanese air force is attacking the enemy mobile force every day. From June 12 to June 20, the Japanese gains were as follows: A. Sunk one enemy battleship, two cruisers, one destroyer, and one submarine. B. Destroyed four or more enemy aircraft carriers, two battleships, four cruisers, eight transports, and one ship of unknown type. C. Shot down more than 300 enemy aircraft.

On June 24 of last year, Rear Admiral Nobumasa Suetsugu, Minister of the Navy, gave a speech on the victory in the Mariana Sea Battle, saying that the people of our country must not stand idly by, and that the Japanese would rely on superior air power to inflict major damage on the enemy ships that come to challenge them.

On July 1, after the Battle of the Mariana Islands, the enemy mobile forces advanced to the Ogasawara Islands and Iwo Jima. The Japanese military fought with them, with the following results: The Japanese forces sank two enemy aircraft carriers and two ships of unknown types in the south of the Ogasawara Islands on June 24, and shot down more than 55 enemy aircraft. In Saipan Island and the nearby sea, from June to July, the results were as follows: Sunk one enemy battleship, two cruisers, two destroyers, and two transport ships; destroyed two aircraft carriers, two destroyers, and five transport ships; and shot down 211 enemy aircraft.

### Two. The Battle of Peleliu Island

On July 17, Navy Minister Shigetarō Shimada resigned and was succeeded by Vice Admiral Naokuni Nomura, First Class, Third Order of Merit.

After the Battle of the Mariana Islands, there were fierce battles in Palau. Before that, there were battles on Guam Island and Tinian Island.

July 26: The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced that enemy forces landed on Tinian Island on July 23, and on July 24, enemy forces landed on Guam Island, both of which were repelled by the Japanese garrison. The fighting on both islands lasted for two months, and the Japanese military never stopped resisting.

On September 22, fighting broke out between Palau and Yap Islands. On one day, more than 100 enemy aircraft were shot down, and there was also fierce fighting on Peleliu Island.

On October 6, the Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced the results of the battle on Palau Island as follows: Since the enemy landed on Peleliu Island on September 15, the enemy has suffered more than 18,000 casualties; more than 90 tanks have been hit and caught fire or run aground; 13 enemy artillery pieces have been destroyed; one cruiser, two destroyers, one submarine, one minesweeper, and one ship of unknown type have been sunk; and one submarine, one minesweeper, and two ships of unknown type, as well as 62 landing craft, have been destroyed.

### Three. The Great Air Battle off Taiwan

The fighting on the Palau Islands was not yet over when the Great Air Battle off Taiwan took place in mid-October, followed by the fiercest air and sea battle since the Greater East Asia War, which unfolded in the four regions of the Philippines.

On October 12, superior enemy aircraft attacked Taiwan. By around 3 p.m., approximately 100 enemy aircraft had been shot down. At the same time, the Japanese air force attacked the enemy mobile forces on the eastern sea off Taiwan on the night of the 12th, repeatedly attacking through the night, sinking one aircraft carrier and one ship of unknown type, and destroying one aircraft carrier and one ship of unknown type.

On October 13, the enemy forces in the sea off Taiwan were completely routed, and the great achievements of the Japanese military included the destruction of more than 40 enemy ships, including: Sinking 10 aircraft carriers, 2 battleships, 3 cruisers, and 1 destroyer; and destroying 3 aircraft carriers, 1 battleship, 4 cruisers, and 11 ships of unknown type.

The Great Air and Sea Battle off the East Sea of Taiwan was the prelude to the Great Battle of the Philippines.

### IV. Naval Battles off the Philippine Islands

The great air and sea battle near the Philippines began on October 15th. By the 25th, the Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced the following battle results: Sunk - 4 aircraft carriers, 3 cruisers, 1 destroyer, and more than 4 transport ships; Damaged - 2 aircraft carriers, 1 battleship, and 2 cruisers.

Taking advantage of the change in weather on October 22nd, the enemy American forces landed on Leyte Island at East Cape in the Philippines, and their warships invaded Leyte Gulf. Consequently, the largest and decisive battle in the Greater East Asia War unfolded continuously within this gulf. Japanese special attack units repeatedly launched attacks, inflicting significant damage on enemy warships.

On October 28th, the Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced two war reports, detailing the great battle results in Leyte Gulf and the eastern sea off the Philippines, which, when combined with the previous results in the sea off Taiwan and the eastern sea, yielded the following remarkable achievements.

Sunk: 19 aircraft carriers, 2 battleships, 6 cruisers, 3 destroyers, 4 transport ships.

Damaged: 15 aircraft carriers, 3 battleships, 6 cruisers, 4 destroyers, 4 transport ships, and 12 ships of unidentified type. In total, 72 enemy ships were sunk or damaged.

Additionally, within Leyte Gulf, approximately 108 enemy landing craft and small vessels were separately sunk or damaged.

Subsequently, the Japanese special attack force launched attacks on the enemy fleet in the eastern sea off the Philippines on October 25th, inflicting damage or sinking on 35 enemy ships between the 25th and 30th. 500 enemy aircraft were shot down. On November 1st, the "Kamikaze" (Divine Wind) squadron attacked enemy ships in Leyte Gulf, destroying and sinking 10 enemy battleships and other vessels in one fell swoop.

Therefore, the turbulent waves of the Pacific Ocean have caused the enemy American fleet to tremble at the power of the Japanese Kamikaze squadrons. Their losses, up to November 2nd, included 88 enemy ships sunk and 121 damaged, totaling 209 ships.

On November 8th, the Japanese Army and Navy separately announced the commanders for the Philippine Islands area. General Tomoyuki Yamashita was appointed as the highest commander of the Army, Lieutenant General Tsunayoshi Uemura as the commander of the Army Air Force, Admiral Denhichi Okochi as the highest commander of the Navy, and Vice Admirals Fukudome Shigeru and Onishi Takijiro as commanders of the Naval Air Force.

On November 10th, Rear Admiral Kondo, the naval attaché in Shanghai, was ordered to transfer to the Naval General Staff on the 7th. His successor, Rear Admiral Minato Yuzuru, officially took office on the 10th and delivered a speech.

The battles in the Philippines progressed under extreme tension. The Japanese special attack units bombed enemy ships in Leyte Gulf, and major battles occurred in the seas off Mindanao and both the east and west coasts of Luzon. On land, enemy troops fought fiercely with Japanese forces on Leyte Island, resulting in a stalemate for more than two months. On December 16th, enemy ships passed the southern tip of the Philippines and entered the western sea off the Philippines, landing on Mindoro Island, but still provided opportunities for Japan to inflict losses on enemy strength. Between December 13th and 15th, 25 enemy ships were sunk or damaged, and between December 20th and 23rd, 22 ships were sunk or damaged. Leyte Gulf, Ormoc Bay, and Mindoro became graveyards for the enemy.

The Kamikaze special attack units again struck enemy ships off the coast of Mindanao between December 28th and 29th, destroying 17 enemy ships. On January 3rd of this year, they also bombed and destroyed 5 enemy ships.

At this time, the enemy's operations against the Philippines shifted from Leyte and Mindoro to a full-scale battle for Luzon Island. This was the focus of the decisive battle in the Philippines.

### V. Great Naval Battle of Lingayen Gulf

From January 3rd to 5th of this year, enemy aircraft first carried out air raids on Taiwan and Okinawa, retreating after losing 25 aircraft.

On January 7th, enemy fleets appeared outside Lingayen Gulf on Luzon Island and lingered outside Manila Bay. They were attacked by Japanese air units, and more than 30 ships were sunk. The enemy's landing operation in Lingayen Gulf on Luzon was carried out daringly on January 9th. Since then, Lingayen Gulf has become the second Leyte Gulf, with enemy ships being bombed and sunk daily. By January 12th, enemy ship losses had reached 121.

The enemy forces landing in Lingayen Gulf remained within a small area, suffering more than 6,000 casualties by the 20th without making progress. According to the announcement by the Japanese Imperial Headquarters on February 2nd, the enemy forces landing in Lingayen had suffered 11,200 casualties. Another part of the enemy fleet entered Manila Bay on January 29th and suffered a fierce attack.

By mid-February, the Philippine operations were suppressed by the enemy's superior strength. The Japanese defenders adopted a war of attrition strategy and withdrew from Manila. General Yamashita established a base in the mountains northeast of Manila and continued fighting, which continues to this day. The next major battle unfolded at Iwo Jima.

### VI. Great Naval Battle of Iwo Jima

On February 17th, the Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced that enemy forces attempted to land on Iwo Jima under heavy shelling, but each attempt was repelled by the Japanese defenders. Simultaneously, the Japanese air force launched fierce attacks around Iwo Jima, sinking 8 enemy ships. This marked the beginning of the Battle of Iwo Jima.

On February 19th, the enemy began landing on Iwo Jima. This heroic war lasted more than 30 days. During the intense battles, the Kamikaze special attack units also joined the fighting. From the 16th to the 22nd, the enemy ships sunk or damaged, according to the Imperial Headquarters, reached 29. By the end of February, this number had increased to more than 50. At the same time, the casualties among the enemy forces landing on the island reached 13,500 by the end of February and had accumulated to more than 20,000 by March 7th. The fact that the enemy had to pay such a price for the area of Iwo Jima, which only measured nine square miles, also demonstrates the loyalty, courage, and sacrifice of the Japanese defenders. On March 16th, the Japanese forces on Iwo Jima declared glorious martyrdom, while the enemy's deaths and injuries totaled approximately 25,800. The heroic name of Lieutenant General Kuribayashi, the commander of the Japanese forces on Iwo Jima, will be eternally remembered.

### VII. Battles Southeast of Kyushu and Okinawa

After Iwo Jima, the decisive battle for Okinawa Island soon began. From March 18th to 23rd, the enemy first appeared with a mobile force in the seas southeast of Kyushu, attempting to disrupt the defense of the Japanese mainland. The Japanese forces, responsible for the heavy task of defending the homeland, met them head-on, sinking 5 enemy fleet carriers, 1 battleship, 5 cruisers, and 1 other ship in five days. The enemy mobile force then retreated southward in disarray.

On March 25th, the enemy mobile force appeared in the seas off Okinawa Island, and part of their forces landed on Kerama Islands. Thus began the ongoing battle for the Ryukyu Islands. From the 26th to the 29th, enemy ships off Okinawa were sunk or damaged. By April 2nd, 177 enemy ships had been sunk in the seas off Okinawa. Subsequently, on April 8th, the Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced the sinking or damaging of another 48 enemy ships, indicating that the enemy's losses were even more severe. According to a consolidated report on the 16th, the enemy ships sunk or damaged around Okinawa had reached 393. If the results of the past month were added, the enemy ships sunk or damaged near Okinawa were at least 400 or more.

To date, Okinawa Island is still being firmly defended by Japanese forces. The further the enemy penetrates into the heart of the Japanese defense line, the greater their losses will be, it can be stated.

Conclusion

Looking at the overall war situation over the past year, the enemy has lost over 1,000 ships, with casualties exceeding 100,000. With the conviction of certain victory, and under the great mission of protecting the homeland, the Japanese Navy is organizing a decisive battle fleet with its elite forces. Under the guidance of Field Marshal Suzuki, the new Prime Minister and Admiral of the Navy, and Navy Minister Admiral Yonai, full preparations are being made.

On May 1st, the Imperial Japanese Navy established a Naval General Headquarters to respond to modern warfare, and Admiral Soemu Toyoda was specially appointed as the first Naval Commander-in-Chief.

It is believed that the Japanese naval lineup will become even more solid. Under the leadership of Admiral Toyoda, the entire army is determined to reduce the enemy to the last man, and fight for the final victory of the Greater East Asia War.

As we celebrate the 40th Japanese Navy Day, we look back on the evolution of the war over the past year and have boundless expectations for the strong navy of our allies.

### Sketches from the Home Front: The Kanagawa Prefecture Naval Clothing Factory

There is a saying now that "the home front is also a battlefield." Just looking at the Kanagawa Prefecture Naval Clothing Factory makes it clear that it is indeed a "battlefield." The female workers there put their entire spirit into their work, even adding an extra stitch to each item and sending as many items as possible to the front lines for the soldiers to wear. The owner of a certain textile company who had previously competed with the world in factory management and production was amazed by this situation, believing that in his past twenty years of work, he had never seen such labor enthusiasm. On this home front battlefield, most of the remarkable achievements were achieved by young women under the age of twenty. Even in aircraft factories, 70-80% of the wartime workers were women. Clothing factories were completely "women's factories."

In the cutting room, they fold fifty layers of cloth, place a template on top, and use electric shears to cut. They continuously cut on a thirty-six-meter-long table, perhaps the only place like this in the country. A fifteen or sixteen-year-old girl grabs one end of the cloth and runs to the side of the table, and a female technician pulls the cloth so that it falls neatly into a box. The girl always runs back and forth. She has to run one hundred and sixty times a day, back and forth totaling three hundred and twenty times. What arduous work!

The fabric room is filled with countless light green rolls of cloth. One by one, they are carried to the cutting room. Hundreds of sewing machines are arranged in rows. They start work at 8:00 AM and stop at 5:30 PM, with two twenty-minute breaks in the morning and afternoon, and a forty-minute lunch break. Aside from that, it is 100% working time. There is a flower hanging on each pillar, which distinguishes it as a "women's factory." There are also many slogans, such as "Work diligently!" To outsiders, the enthusiastic work ethic seems like madness. In ordinary factories, the foreman is simply a supervisor, but in this factory, she is just another worker. If the materials are late, a scolding is heard: "Foreman, hurry up!" Fifteen and sixteen-year-old girls use irons that seem too heavy for them, working nimbly. Even a strong man would be tired after working like that for thirty minutes straight.

Those with weaker bodies work in the cap-making room, but even there they produce four times more than in an ordinary factory. Each female worker wants to sew an extra stitch and make an extra item for the soldiers on the front lines. Because of this labor enthusiasm, they are overjoyed when they complete a lot of work. Sometimes, they are so excited that they cannot sleep at night. The factory's attendance rate is actually "98.93%," with only 1.07% being absent, and this number is entirely due to illness.

Koun Dormitory, Shiran Dormitory, these are the names of their dormitories. Their dormitories are completely naval style, just like the living quarters of naval students. On the blackboard in the dormitory, a large motto is written: "No matter how much knowledge you have, if you are not virtuous and brave, you are nothing. Our lives are about courage." (From the Asahi Newspaper, May 23rd)

### Visiting the Anti-Submarine School

"Modern warfare" can be called a complete "replenishment war." The greater the increased production of aircraft, the greater the responsibility of escort ships, anti-submarine vessels, and transport ships to protect the sea lanes connecting resource areas and the homeland. It is only natural that enemy submarines will try to disrupt these communication lines. In this intense replenishment war, graduating officer candidates are now carrying the expectations of the entire nation on their shoulders and fighting hard. The reporter visited the Anti-Submarine School and saw the candidates training silently and relentlessly, preparing to dedicate themselves to this intense replenishment war. The reporter sincerely hopes that these candidates will make endless achievements in the "replenishment war sea."

The "Anti-Submarine School" was already respected in its past incarnation as the Torpedo School. This school uses sonar and hydroacoustic devices to detect enemy submarines. Warships launch depth charges, and aircraft assist from the side. This war of attacking submarines from the air and sea has changed the past. In 1944, it was renamed the "Anti-Submarine School," and everything was reorganized and adjusted to meet the needs of the nation.

The candidates who graduated from this school are already active on the front lines of the anti-submarine war. However, the situation is becoming more urgent every day, and more general student participation is naturally desired. The situation now requires students to go to the front lines immediately, fighting alongside the soldiers. This is a feeling that I strongly had.

A certain lieutenant (graduate of Tokyo Imperial University) who returned from the front lines to become an instructor at his alma mater moved me greatly with his words. The replenishment war, which decides victory or defeat, requires even more dedication to sea defense, anti-submarine warfare, and other anti-submarine operations than ever before. For the core personnel, it is required to learn quickly, which depends on how hard the students work. The first half of the training period for officer candidates mainly covers navigation, gunnery, communication, aeronautics, short boat land warfare, swordsmanship, and bayonet practice; the second half focuses on technical subjects such as underwater measurement, navigation, anti-submarine operations, and maritime escort. The emphasis is on understanding the soul of anti-submarine operations, depth judgment, and depth charge warfare. Most of the instructors who live with the students are graduates of the school.

These young officers are all soldiers who have come back after fighting through gunfire. After waking up at 6:00 AM, they offer a distant bow to the heavens. The schedule includes morning exercises (gymnastics, running, one hour of self-study), three hours of classes in the morning, lunch, and three hours of classes in the afternoon. This is how the students at the school are trained. At that time, I was listening to the experiences of Lieutenant S (graduate of Ryogoku Higher Marine School).

Lieutenant S's escort vessel protected a transport ship and continued towards XXX. After sailing for several nights, the transport ship reached its destination. At that time, two snow-white water mine traces came directly towards the transport ship. The sun was still high, this was a daylight attack, looking down on the Japanese escort ship. Lieutenant S was beside himself with anger, he said, “Damn it!" Then the escort ship followed the traces of the water mines, at full throttle to find the enemy. In a flash, oil covered the surface of the sea, a moth drawn to the flame! S Lieutenant felt extremely happy.

When they heard about the achievements of their elders, the students worked even harder in their physical training and academic studies. When they heard about the sacrifices of their elders during submarine attacks, the students shed tears for the fallen heroes and vowed revenge.

"When we protect the transport fleet and complete our mission safely, countless classmates come to greet us at the harbor. After a brief greeting, we start talking about our respective battles, at this time, it can be said is the most enjoyable part. However, sometimes we do not see our comrades' faces at the port. At that time, we....

### Naval Engineering School

As I approached the student hall, the large clock between the windows of its three stories struck 11:50 AM. Students in white uniforms were running. The "First Classmen," wearing battle caps, were constantly loudly scolding the "First and Second Classmen," wearing military caps, and the "Third Classmen." For some reason, the sound of leather boots echoed loudly on the wooden corridor, making it very lively. The chaotic and lively scene left one speechless. At that time, Lieutenant Commander Yamamoto, who was leading the tour, said:

### Disciplined Extracurricular Life

"Running is a daily routine, and you are not allowed to walk slowly. Movements within a warship must strive to take place as fast as possible, so one must be strictly trained in peacetime. However, it is not like this at all times. In the classroom or self-study room, one must be calm and relaxed. You will see this later, and you will find that it is as quiet as in a forest. Look, they move quickly and silently. In fact, they are not allowed to chat when they are doing things, whether it is cleaning or polishing shoes. They are all silent."

"At 12 o'clock, everyone gathers in the cafeteria for lunch, but the entire gathering takes place only five minutes beforehand. The last five minutes are certainly important, but the first five minutes are even more important in the Navy. No matter what task, one must be in a standby posture five minutes beforehand. On the surface, it may seem unimportant, but in reality, it is related to the whole. Rising in time is essential in a fleet battle. To put it more simply, it is the spirit of the first shot hitting the target." "It felt like being shocked by electricity." "Perhaps I was killed by an enemy submarine." When we learn of the unfortunate incident, we sit on the ground and cry uncontrollably. Then we shout loudly, "Students in the mainland, put down your pens and join the war!"

The above are the words of Lieutenant A (graduate of Tokyo Imperial University). The main characteristic of the school is that the entire faculty and students are like one family.

"The students regard us teachers as older brothers. We treat the students as younger brothers. I have never seen such a good phenomenon during my student days. Even our private lives are discussed with our superiors. For example, we seek their opinions on marriage. This kind of thing is like sitting on a small warship and executing a special mission against enemy submarines. We develop a close relationship."

This was a naval life that Lieutenant B (graduate of Keio University) had never imagined before entering the school. He felt that the atmosphere of the Anti-Submarine School was very good. When the officer candidates complete their period of study, the indomitable fighting spirit they have cultivated is enough to protect transport fleets day and night without sleep or food, completing their missions. These young officers already have the patience of iron and stone, showing a majestic spirit on escort ships, anti-submarine vessels, and minesweepers. (Translated from the Mainichi Shimbun) To put it more simply, it is the spirit of the first shot hitting the target."

At the entrance of the student hall, there are four pillars, which mark the crossroads of the corridor. The students were moving quickly. We stood there for a moment. Soon, the lieutenant commander suddenly smiled:

"Did you notice? Look, none of the students are walking outside the pillars, they are all passing through the four pillars. This is not because there are any rules or instructions requiring them to do so. Among the students, there has long been, ever since I was a student, such an unwritten rule: An Imperial soldier does not take shortcuts, but walks straight with dignity. Senior students often tell junior students this. As a result, it has created the unique culture of this school."

After lunch, there is a break until 2:00 PM. The students appear in the square, each squadron doing what they wish. The sunlight occasionally breaks through the dense clouds, brightening the drill ground surrounded by pine and camphor trees. Look, there is a mounted combat game, and on this side, they are playing baseball, gliding, and driving cars. Some students are even playing cat and mouse games. It is said that they do not wash clothes on good days, because they can hand the washed clothes to the drying facility, and they will dry them immediately, regardless of whether it is rainy or sunny. Even more interesting is that on snowy days, they pile up snow to create fortresses and play snow-covered base defense games. The situation is very passionate and tragic, and sometimes they really get into fights that result in head injuries, leaving patches of blood on the white snow. "Tenacity" is the first goal of this school's education. Kendo and other combat skills also aim to cultivate a spirit of confrontation, with etiquette being of secondary importance.

### The Spirit of Fighting to the End

Entering the school gate, on the left side of the auditorium, there is a road along the mountain. Climbing about a hundred steps along this road leads to the top. This small hill is called Azalea Hill. It is the sacred place of the school. At the top, there is a shrine dedicated to the Great Goddess Amaterasu, and not far from the jade railing, there is a bust, a stern-looking student statue, placed high on a granite rectangular column base about two meters high. This is the statue of Okubo Teiin, a student of the first year. He was originally unfamiliar with the water. Four months after entering the school, he finally learned to swim. In a swimming competition, he volunteered to participate in a long-distance swim, striving to the end, and finally became a "guest of no return" four or five hundred meters from the finish line. He is the best symbol of the school's spirit of tenacity. Hidden within the strict training is the determined spirit of the faculty and students' hard work and effort. Today, if students have any unusual behavior, they are ordered to visit the statue, or they voluntarily run to the statue to reflect and repent.

### The Source of Naval Science

"Naval Academy, Engineering Academy, and Accounting Academy are all places for cultivating naval officers, the source of naval science, and the training ground for cadres who can apply science to gain victory in war. They are also the supply department for technical officers who will bring glory to the nation." Indeed, its equipment can be described as perfect. For example, in the physics classroom, there are no fewer than fifty or sixty types of gears, and each part of the ship's machinery is carefully divided, with a cut-open boiler, so that people can understand its complex structure at a glance. Each subject, from basic to practical training, from practical training to application, ensures that every student can apply what they have learned upon leaving the school, rather than engaging in closed-door theorizing. Therefore, every instructor is conscientious and does not merely impart knowledge. Japanese naval officers are cultivated in such sincere and passionate education. All students live in the school, and get up together at six o'clock in the morning when the sky is still dark. In this way, they cultivate a personality of consistent learning and action, a personality that can not only operate machinery, but also control the people who operate it. This is the demeanor of an officer.

### Naval Accounting Academy

The early spring sunshine shines through the large glass windows, overlooking the courtyard below, with the clear sky of Tokyo and the surface of the Sumida River as the backdrop. In the courtyard, a team of students with bare upper bodies are doing exercises. Although it is early spring, the remnants of the accumulated snow remain in the shady areas. However, these young people seem to have forgotten the cold.

Across the courtyard, another team of students runs out of the school building, lines up in the courtyard, takes off their black caps with yellow trim, unbuttons their short jackets, removes their white shirts, and joins the exercises. From running out of the school building to the exercise field, including the time to undress, takes less than a minute, showing their agility. The one issuing commands and leading the exercises is one of the students.

The short jackets they take off are the uniforms of the students of the Naval Accounting Academy. This school, like the Naval Academy and the Engineering Academy, is a place for training Japanese naval officers. The gate of the school building is adorned with a brilliant chrysanthemum crest. Among these three schools, each boasting superior tradition and none willing to be outdone by the others, the entrance examination of the Naval Accounting Academy is considered somewhat unparalleled.

Because the school's name is Naval Accounting Academy, people may generally think that the students are just figures who wear visors and calculate money with abacuses. In the past, I thought so too.

"Those who believe that only officers and soldiers of the combat arms directly engaged in combat on the front lines are the flower of the military may think that the accounting corps is slightly inferior, but this is a big mistake. Because not only do they advance and retreat with the combat arms in actual warfare, but there is no difference from other combat arms schools in terms of school training and academic education. Moreover, the Naval Academy, Engineering Academy, and Accounting Academy stand as a tripod, jointly sharing the operation of the Navy. Now, please look at the student education schedule." Instructor ╳ Lieutenant Commander pointed to the student education schedule posted on the screen behind him. It is roughly as follows:

### What is the Soul of an Engineering Officer

"What is the soul of an engineering officer?" I often asked this question. I received the following answer:

"A certain warship was bombed, its speed greatly reduced, and flames gradually spread. Finally, the entire ship had to be abandoned. At this time, a reporter ran to the engine room to inform them, but the squad leader replied, 'Never mind, bring me a cigarette first! This is where I die.' No matter how they persuaded him, he refused to escape, and the reporter had no choice but to leave. By the time they brought the cigarette, the fire was already very large, and they had to use the speaking tube for the final contact, but they heard the squad leader singing loudly, a drunken revelry song! Moreover, the lights there remained on until the ship sank into the waves. We didn't care how much we were bombed, or how much the ship was shaking. We didn't want to come out and watch the enemy planes, and we couldn't leave our posts. Everyone calmly did their job, prepared to die in their positions, and no one was willing to leave their positions to escape death. The engine room is below the armor line of the warship. If a bomb falls near the ventilation pipes, air cannot enter. There is also the possibility of steam pipes being damaged and leaking steam, and gas escaping. In such a situation, if there is no way to remedy it, all the workers in the engine room will lose their lives. However, if the steam is stopped, the warship cannot move, making it easier for enemy planes to attack. How many squad leaders have been trapped in this situation! And the heroic and decisive spirit of resolutely deploying everything and deciding not to die in vain is the expression of the leader's demeanor, and also the expression of pure sincerity. This is the symbol of the soul of an engineering officer." (Translated from Weekly Asahi, Volume 45, Issue 12)

Spiritual education includes several courses such as Imperial Rescript reading, interpretation, and exhortation. Training is divided into two categories: drill and work, including thirteen courses such as land warfare, short boat, signal, deployment drill, winter practice, cold resistance training, shipboard practice, camping, swimming training, field exercise, parade, sailing training, long rowing, and marching.

There are ten courses of duty including daily work and various inspections. Physical education includes various martial arts, sports, and physical skills in martial arts, gymnastics, and physical techniques. In this education, can you smell the stench of the accounting corps? Not at all!

In terms of academic education, they are all specialized subjects. As seen in the table above, there are a total of forty-three subjects under the three major categories of military science, basic science, and general science. The instructors are recruited from experts in various fields other than naval professors. As for martial arts, masters in the field guide them, with the goal of having all students possess standard martial arts qualifications. Every day, after waking up at 5:30 am in the summer and 6:00 am in the winter, until the inspection at 9:40 pm, there is not a minute wasted. Looking at the weekly schedule, there are ten major hours every day of the week, with no so-called holidays. And how they are used can multiply their effectiveness.

"When they first enter the school, many students regret why they had to enter such a busy school. We had such feelings when we were students. But after a month, they get used to it and can even find leisure in it," said Instructor ╳ Lieutenant Commander. He also pointed to the graduation photo hanging on the wall and said:

"This is me."

"Haha, the down hasn't dried yet!" Instructor 〇 teased from the side.

Students' grades are referred to as the nth class student according to the order of their entry into the school, or as the nth grade student based on the distinction of the academic year, but among students, they are usually called No. 1 student, No. 2 student, etc., starting from the highest grade. The students' academic education is organized by academic year, with a class leader and assistant leader system. Daily training and living are organized into squads by grade, with students from the highest grade serving as squad leaders under the command of the squad supervisors, guiding the squad members. ╳ Lieutenant Commander is the squad supervisor. Squad supervisors are instructors who are directly responsible for training and handle personnel and other matters of the squad members. This mixed squad system of each academic year is the basis of the Naval Accounting Academy student life and a common feature of the three naval schools. In addition, there is a weekly student system, where students from the highest grade take turns to maintain the military discipline and decorum of the student corps and assist in the implementation of daily routines and tasks. The weekly students and the squad leaders maintain close horizontal and vertical communication, and are responsible for autonomous training in the capacity of older brothers. Therefore, the direct leaders in the school are the squad leaders and the weekly students. This is the key to monitoring. The brotherhood established by students of the same class lasts a lifetime, and their relationship can even extend to their future families.

The time for classes arrived, and I went to visit their classrooms.

In the classroom for general engineering, a professor in an ordinary suit was drawing diagrams on the blackboard, lecturing on the use of brakes. On the desks, each student had a cannon-like working tool. Indeed, such a lesson requires such things.

In the accounting classroom, students were practicing recording money transactions. In another room, an instructor in civilian clothes was holding a large paper scroll model, explaining its meaning; this was the language classroom. Next to the English classroom, there was a model of a warship on the podium. An instructor in uniform stood in front of a map, explaining the structure of the warship.

Speaking of warships, the students' campus life is entirely based on the life of warship duty. When they graduate, they are naval accounting ensign candidates, and after one year of practice on a training fleet and a joint fleet, they become qualified naval accounting officers. However, even as accounting officers, if they are excluded from ship duty, their naval life is equivalent to zero. The mission of an accounting officer is to manage the manpower and material resources that are the source of military power, and to prepare and enrich the war effort. Whether their use is appropriate or not can immediately affect combat effectiveness. This is clearly stated in the student service guidelines, so the importance of the task is connected to the spirit of serving on ships.

"Neat and clear accounts, a spirit of sure victory, so as not to shame those on board the ship." According to Instructor ╳, this is the slogan of ship duty.

Turning down the long corridor, while descending the stairs, I unconsciously reached the front of the bathroom. Peeking inside, steam was rising from the cracks in the lid of the large bathtub, which was very refreshing.

From 3:00 pm to 4:00 pm, it was time for physical education. Today, there was said to be judo instruction by Mifune Tenth Dan and kendo instruction by Nakayama Sensei, but I wanted to observe rowing.

The short boat is a small speedboat with twelve oars. The rowers were wearing white work clothes, with their hat straps fastened, and were commanded by the student squad leader.

"Right turn!" "No. 6, don't bend your upper body inward!"

Following the student squad leader's commands and guidance, the twelve oars rose and fell, like wings skimming over the water. After fifty minutes of vigorous rowing, they returned to the boathouse under the courtyard.

Dinner ended at 5:00 pm, and self-study began at 6:00 pm. During the three hours of quiet study time, there was a 10-minute break. During the break, there was a sweet treat to eat twice a week. If a student happened to be born on that day, everyone would express their congratulations to him. This day happened to be a day when sweet treats were distributed according to regulations. On the tables in the cafeteria, there were two sweet buns per plate, and the same on the instructors' tables. The student supervisor stood on a high place and asked loudly: "Who was born today?" Then a student who was born on that day stood up, stated his birthplace and experience, and then gave his thoughts and aspirations. At the end of the speech, a student representative gave a congratulatory speech, and everyone applauded like thunder.

"Does anyone have an entertainment program? Military songs, gymnastics are all fine. Don't be shy, or Instructor K will do it!"

"I do, I can sing the love [unclear] marching song in various languages."

The military song was sung very well, it could be said to have reached a high level.

In such a [unclear] and harmonious atmosphere, the [unclear] minutes slipped away unconsciously.

Instructor × said when he went to the instructor's office:

"One day's hard work can be eliminated in this way. In fact, although this is called a school, it is no different from the military, so everything must be done in accordance with military [unclear], and everyone must act with one heart. At first, when they came in, they thought it was a school, and only felt constrained and suppressed, and thought it was bitter. Later, they slowly realized what military discipline is, and became aware of their own calling, and [unclear] gradually [unclear] into military spirit and personality.

"However, since this place is called the Accounting Academy, acquiring the necessary [unclear] skills is, of course, as fundamental as becoming a soldier. In today's world of complete [unclear] aerial warfare, the supply of manpower and material resources is most important, so in order to achieve this goal, we must use all our efforts to train talents.

"The Accounting Academy was once considered the most [unclear] school to enter, but this was only a phenomenon when the number of admissions was small in the past. Now, there is a great need to increase the number of accounting corps officers, so this school is no longer the first [unclear] barrier. This school welcomes young people who are [unclear] ambitious and sincerely dedicated to serving the country."

The time for self-discipline arrived. In the self-study room, each student sat upright and [unclear], led by the class leader, [unclear] reciting waka poems. At this time, similar reciting [unclear] sounds could be heard from each self-study room. After the recitation, they returned to silence. Suddenly, a [unclear] sound came from afar, and the students [unclear] left their seats like springs and quickly walked out of the self-study room together. In the empty room, every desk and every chair was clean and tidy, and in good order. Looking at the blackboard, I realized that the waka poem just [unclear] recited was from the New Collection of Ancient and Modern Poems. (By Lin Weiyi) (Translated from Weekly Mainichi)

### Naval Knowledge - Explanation of Warships

Battleships

In modern navies, battleships remain the foundation of military strength and the main force in naval warfare. However, due to the theory of aviation supremacy and other theories, the theory of the uselessness of battleships and the theory of abolishing battleships once rose, causing the position of battleships, which had long held the naval throne, to shake. The reason for this is that battleships are heavier and slower than airplanes and cannot avoid airplane attacks, and cannot withstand airplane bombs and torpedo attacks. However, battleships are attacking weapons, and the problem of their defensive power is by no means simply [unclear] to be completed. It must be regarded as a means of attack in itself. Therefore, just as the temporary abnormal development of submarines led to the theory of the uselessness of battleships, by strengthening their defensive power again, battleships can still ensure a certain degree of defensive power and maintain their throne as the main force of the navy.

Regarding modern battleships, taking the representative battleships of the United Kingdom, the United States, and Japan as examples, the thickness of their armor plates is as follows:

In the manufacture of British battleships, after the King George V and Prince of Wales classes, special steel was used for deck armor, and although its thickness was reduced to 13 cm, it had significant strength. As they boasted, this type of battleship could fully resist air force bombing and even bounce back large bombs. However, under the human-bullet attacks of the Japanese navy, its weaknesses were still difficult to hide, and as a result, it inevitably turned into [unclear] off the coast of Malaya. As for the United States, it reduced its speed to 26.7 knots per hour, thereby strengthening the battleship's defensive power. Although its anti-aircraft defensive power has increased, it is equally weak and powerless when attacked by the Japanese Kamikaze Special Attack Force. At this point, the issue of the air force-ization of the navy was raised for discussion again. However, Rear Admiral Taishima Shin, the former Chief of Operations of the United States, once praised battleships greatly, [unclear] as he said: "The position of battleships in the navy is like the position of soldiers in the army. If the United States engages in a long-term war, the last thing that can be used is battleships." Battleships have large cannons, like floating fortresses. Their attack power, long-range endurance, and survivability still maintain their position in the fleet, and they are the backbone of the expeditionary navy.

The main factor in the attack power, which is no different from the life of a battleship, is its main guns. The caliber and number of main guns of battleships of various countries, as currently known, are as follows:

Japan (Nagato class): Eight 16-inch guns

United States (Washington class): Nine 40 cm guns

(Colorado class): Nine 16-inch guns

United Kingdom (King George V class): Twelve 36 cm guns

(Nelson class): Nine 16-inch guns

France (Richelieu class): Eight 38 cm guns

Italy (Littorio class): Nine 38 cm guns

Compared with the ten 12-inch main guns installed on the Dreadnought, which was launched in the Portsmouth Naval Dockyard in the United Kingdom forty years ago (1906) and was the largest and most advanced battleship at the time, the speed of its progress is astonishing. Moreover, some modern battleships are equipped with 18-inch main guns, and many are equipped with anti-aircraft high-angle guns (about 20) of 20 cm or 12 cm, and anti-aircraft machine guns (about 50).

In addition to playing the main role in naval warfare, battleships, such as those of the United States, also use their special characteristics as fortresses to protect aircraft carriers, and use their giant cannons to bombard land.

Aircraft Carriers

Due to the progress of aviation engineering, aircraft have become the central power of modern naval warfare, and aircraft carriers have emerged as a result, so they are a relatively new type of ship. Its characteristic is that it is not only a mobile airfield that acts with great speed, but also an anti-aircraft gun capable of matching a cruiser, equipped with an aircraft hangar, bomb depot, barracks, repair shop, and fuel depot.

Today's aircraft carriers are roughly divided into three types: one is the large standard aircraft carrier with a displacement of more than 30,000 tons, which can be compared to a battleship; another is the auxiliary aircraft carrier with a displacement of 14,000 to 20,000 tons, which is roughly equivalent to a cruiser; and the last is the escort aircraft carrier of about 10,000 tons, which is converted from a merchant ship. Just as their displacements differ, the aircraft carrying capacity that determines their performance is also very different, that is, a standard carrier can carry about 100 aircraft, an auxiliary carrier about 50, and an escort carrier only 20-30.

In addition, there are seaplane carriers that specialize in carrying seaplanes that do not require a flight deck, with a displacement of about 10,000 tons, which can accommodate 20-30 aircraft and have four or five flight launch rails.

The greatest task of an aircraft carrier is to roam freely on the oceans, dispatching its aircraft at any time and any place, so that its fleet can carry out decisive battles within the airspace control area. Other major tasks of aircraft carriers include approaching the coasts of enemy countries and bombing their rear cities or military industrial areas. Therefore, their endurance must be great and their speed of movement must be fast. In particular, high speed is the first requirement for high-performance fast aircraft and increasingly large bombers to be able to take off and land on their narrow decks, so the speed of aircraft carriers in various countries has gradually increased to more than 20 knots.

Because the flight deck of an aircraft carrier is wider than that of other warships, and it must sail against the wind when aircraft take off and land, it is a target for enemy aircraft and submarines. However, with the progress of aircraft development, its value has increased day by day and has even surpassed the battleships that hold the naval throne. Therefore, in the Greater East Asia War, the first target of the Japanese Kamikaze Special Attack Force, which was destined to sink, was often selected to be aircraft carriers.

Submarines

In modern naval warfare where aircraft are paramount, submarines are valued because of their unique secrecy. Submarines can secretly approach enemy ships and sink enemy capital ships with powerful torpedoes in one fell swoop, making their power terrifying. Therefore, submarines must also have the endurance to participate in fleet operations with battleships and continue to operate for long periods. Moreover, in modern naval warfare, submarines often use their stealth to perform tasks such as reconnaissance, enemy search,警戒, and transportation, and they are important types of ships. Furthermore, submarines make the enemy navy suspect that they exist everywhere on the sea surface. As a result, they can exert unparalleled power in coastal defense, commerce raiding, and land defense, and they are extremely powerful weapons.

However, their mobility is slow and their visibility is narrow. If they are discovered by enemy ships or aircraft, it is extremely difficult to escape quickly. Therefore, all countries are now striving to increase their speed and quantity. The large-scale submarine construction that was once advocated now seems to have been forgotten.

The displacement of submarines is usually 6-700 tons to 2,000 tons, the surface speed is 14-15 knots to 20 knots, and the underwater speed is about 10 knots per hour. They are equipped with 10-12 cm guns, have 5-6 torpedo tubes, and their cruising range is considerable, capable of continuous sailing for one to three months. Therefore, if they depart from a military port in mainland Japan, they can sail to the west coast of the United States for combat and then return to their original port. The latest submarines can also carry aircraft.

Finally, it is worth mentioning that American submarines must be accompanied by lifeboats. If the crew of special ships like submarines are only concerned with the safety of their lives and cannot sacrifice themselves to fight, then the combat effectiveness of the American Navy can be imagined.

### Shipboard Shrines

The Combined Fleet that decided Japan's fate in the sea battles, when disbanded on December 20, 1905 (Meiji 38), Commander-in-Chief Togo issued an instruction to all subordinates: "We soldiers seek military power from the metaphysical." The soldiers on the battlefield who are currently deciding Japan's fate can be described as having a death-defying fighting spirit. Regardless of the enemy's numerical superiority, they only use their spirit to attack forward. The enemy, the United States and Great Britain, rely solely on vast amounts of iron and material as conditions for combat, emphasizing the elements of the physical world. Looking back at Japan, there is a true difference as great as heaven and earth. What constitutes the foundation of traditional military thought in Japan is spiritual strength, that is, the military spirit cultivated by the nation's unparalleled founding spirit, the fighting spirit of "seven lives to repay the country," the spirit of self-sacrifice, and the traditional spirit of naval bravery.

On February 4, 1895 (Meiji 28), when the torpedo boat squadron launched a night attack on Weihaiwei, Commander-in-Chief Ito strictly ordered, "This officer orders you to sink the enemy ships in the harbor!" All the commanders answered in unison and immediately conveyed the message to the boat captains. Then, they burned their documents, put on new clothes, and desperately launched their attack. None of them hoped to survive, preferring to perish with the enemy ships. Fifty years later, this kind of naval tradition has reappeared.

Even before the Battle of the Sea of Japan, Marshal Togo, who led the "Combined Fleet," was ready to set out to kill the enemy. At the beginning of the Russo-Japanese War, during the attack on Port Arthur, he sank and destroyed two enemy battleships and one cruiser. The launch of the "successful Japanese surprise attack," the Greater East Asia War, and the annihilation of the enemy's main force in Pearl Harbor, are all nothing more than the accumulation of many years of hard work, fifty years of tradition of the Japanese Navy.

Moreover, the steel warships clearly have a shared soul, and within this same tradition, a firm and unwavering Japanese character is cultivated. Accepting all comers, winning every battle, the steel will of the Imperial Fleet riding the long winds and breaking the waves for thousands of miles, coupled with new and sharp machinery, refined technology, vigorous spirit, outstanding command, and leadership, can produce the "unshakable belief in victory." All of these interweaving life-giving warships have shipboard shrines that symbolize the Japanese spirit. Originally, on warships, the Emperor's portrait, the core of the warship's life, and the glorious warship flag are enshrined. However, in shipboard life, as an object of faith for the Japanese people, there must be a god at their side to whom they bow and worship morning and evening. Originally, according to regulations, warships are not necessarily required to have shrines. Although it is unclear how it happened, according to General Kiyokazu Ando, "I remember that there seemed to be none during the Sino-Japanese War, but they already existed during the Russo-Japanese War." Lieutenant General Nagashige Ogasawara also testified to this, saying, "On the Izumo warship, the changing of the Izumo Taisha Shrine to a ship god for worship was before the Russo-Japanese War." But exactly how it happened is really baffling.

From the ancient days of Empress Jingu's conquest of the Three Hans, when Amaterasu Omikami was enshrined and the banner of Hachiman Daibosatsu was hung, the Hachiman ships floating on the seas of Greater East Asia, down to the fishing boats that worshiped Konpira, the Yamato people, who are full of fighting spirit on the sea, are extremely devout in their faith and worship of the gods. Now, all Japanese warships enshrine gods. Therefore, on November 30, 1940 (Showa 15), Naval Custom "Regarding the Enshrinement and Worship of Gods by Warships, Units, Official Ranks, Schools, etc." clearly stipulated in the first item:

1.  The front of the warship shrine should be at the bow.

2.  Objects of worship: (A) Amaterasu Omikami is the main deity, placed in the center of the altar; (B) Shrines that differ according to warships, units, government offices, schools, etc., or the local deity, should be arranged next to the main deity; (C) Omitted

3.  Memorial days: Ise Shrine Memorial Day (Toyouke Daijingu 10th and 16th, Kotaijingu October 17th), the day the warship is launched, the day of completion, or the day the shrine is completed.

Before this, the name of the shrine always included the warship's name. If the warship's name was a country name, then it was named after a palace of the country. If it was a mountain or water name, then the shrine was also named after the mountain or water, and often enshrined Amaterasu Omikami. Whenever there was an opportunity, the captain would organize a worship team to pray for lasting military fortune, and even invite a special priest to initiate a dojo. Even during peacetime, during rowing competitions and shooting tournaments, they would worship at the shrine, and the trophy for winning the competition would be placed next to the shrine. The spiritual center of such a large family as a warship is sustained by revering the ancestors of the nation. Now is wartime. Divine works have become an aid to the main guns, the bridge, and the torpedo tubes in conducting operations. In the quiet and slightly dark shrine inside the ship, a divided spirit of the god is moved to the narrow and gray turret, near the torpedo tube opening, and even in the high-altitude shooting command post, seemingly looking down on the enemy. Japanese soldiers can truly be said to be all divine soldiers. Divine sake is dripped on the torpedoes, and protective amulets are attached, and then incantations are recited in prayer.

Previously, when Japanese submarines went as far as allied Germany, the German Navy understood the reason for the strength of the Japanese Navy when they saw the shipboard shrines. The newsreel "Sinking" of submarine operations in the Indian Ocean also had a scene of a shipboard shrine. Under the shrine were posted the numbers of sunk merchant ships, oil tankers, etc. The crew, covered in sweat, with mud and grease on their faces and backs, in a boat filled with body odor and turbid air, had a shrine made of white wood, and soldiers with devout faces praying before the god. In such a scene, all Japanese people would be moved.

On the eve of the attack on Hawaii, the pilots placed the bombing sights in front of the shrine, praying only for a successful surprise attack, not hoping for survival.

On June 8, 1942 (Showa 17), at 4:00 AM, the entire team was lined up on the hillside where they could see ×× Bay. In front of them was a small box wrapped in a warship flag, on which was enshrined the god of the Shirotae Beach Shrine. They constantly heard a loud voice like the cry of a sandpiper; "Salute to the Shirotae Beach Shrine! Raise guns!" Then, the trumpet sounded high and clear, stirring up the tune of the Japanese national anthem, illuminating the sky of the northern dawn. After finishing, everyone shouted "Long live the Emperor!" with all their might. (Report by a member of the news team)

During the Solomon Sea battle, before the fleet attacked the enemy's sleeping eyes at night, the time of the attack was written on the blackboard in the flagship's officer's room:

The time of the attack is 8:30 PM. The more I thought about this, the more uneasy I felt, but the uneasy feelings gradually intensified. I shook my head, ran out of the officer's room, turned left along the corridor, and ran to the white wooden shrine, standing there silently. A bright light was lit inside the shrine. A duty soldier stood next to it with a gun. The shrine was still new. Seeing a white wooden shrine inside a steel warship aroused infinite thoughts. (Report by a member of the Niwa news team "Sea Battle")

In a short while, the main guns opened fire. The night curtain of the Strait of Tulagi was torn apart by a thunderous roar, and a tragic flame appeared in the dark ocean, shaking the world in the universe. However, around the white wooden shrine, it was as quiet as usual. The duty soldier under the light stood like a statue. As fixed as the captain standing on the bridge –

Accompanied by the gods of the nation's ancestors, illuminating the four seas, embarking on the expedition. (Translated from Asahi Shimbun)
