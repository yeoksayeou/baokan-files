### Japan Convenes Meeting of Ambassadors from Various Nations, Issues Joint Statement Yesterday Reaffirming Determination to Complete the War

Tokyo, 23rd (Central News Agency Telegram) - It has been one and a half years since the Greater East Asia Conference was convened in November of the year before last. During this period, the enemy's, Britain and America's, ambition to dominate Greater East Asia has become increasingly exposed, threatening the independence of Greater East Asian nations and invading various parts of Greater East Asia. The Japanese government, in order to thoroughly establish the principles of the Greater East Asia Declaration and to adapt to the changing world situation in accordance with the ideals guiding Greater East Asia, with the understanding of the governments of various Greater East Asian nations, decided to convene a meeting of Greater East Asia Ambassadors. This meeting was held in Tokyo. Attendees included Japanese Foreign Minister and Greater East Asia Minister Tōgō, Republic of China Ambassador Cai, Manchukuo Ambassador Wang, Burma Ambassador Thein Maung, Thailand Ambassador U Chit, and Philippine Republic Ambassador Vargas. They frankly exchanged opinions on ways to complete the Greater East Asia War and on building a world order based on common war aims. In the final meeting on the 23rd, they passed the Greater East Asia Joint Statement, further expanding and developing the Greater East Asia Declaration. The enemy, Britain and America, plans to convene the San Francisco Conference on the 25th to discuss post-war international security guarantees. However, the world order advocated by Britain and America is an order of great power tyranny and monopoly. Even within the enemy's ranks, this point has been clearly pointed out. They themselves have overturned the principles of the Atlantic Charter, and their inconsistency is despised by the world. The Greater East Asia Declaration, which states the war aims of the Greater East Asian nations, is determined to eliminate such tyranny, monopoly, and discrimination, and to build a just new world order. It reaffirms the magnificent determination of our 1 billion Greater East Asian people to concentrate all their strength and crush the enemy's ambitions. Its significance is extremely important.

### Original Text of the Joint Statement

Tokyo, 23rd (Central News Agency Telegram) - The joint statement passed at the Greater East Asia Ambassador Meeting held in Tokyo on the 23rd is as follows:

The countries of Greater East Asia, facing the endless invasions of Britain and America, are cooperating with each other to liberate Greater East Asia from the shackles of Britain and America, and to achieve self-existence and self-prosperity. Overcoming all difficulties, they have been advancing on the path to the common completion of the war until today. However, Britain and America are using their power to oppress various neutral countries, using them as tools for their war. In the name of liberating other countries, they are actually arbitrarily expanding their sphere of influence, interfering in the internal affairs of various countries. Needless to say, they are threatening the existence of opposing nations and the foundations of the survival of nations, and even attempting to completely obliterate their inherent cultures. The post-war plans that Britain and America harbor today, no matter what political methods are used to embellish them, are based solely on force, forcibly supporting an order that suits their intentions. This kind of ambition is ultimately difficult to conceal. Britain and America are attempting to place international politics under their tyranny and presumptuously take on the role of global police, further planning to monopolize the world's economy in order to make their imperialistic control of the world more permanent. Therefore, other countries and nations cannot be guaranteed a just and equal position for survival and prosperity, especially for the nations of Greater East Asia, they still adhere to prejudices and discriminatory concepts. The war aims of us and them are absolutely incompatible. Britain and America are consistently attempting to maintain and strengthen this irrational international order, while the war aims of the Greater East Asian nations are to eliminate such tyranny, monopoly, and discrimination, and to build a true order based on justice. The countries of Greater East Asia previously issued a joint declaration, clarifying the meaning and purpose of the Greater East Asia War. Now, because the violence of Britain and America is about to completely trample on international justice and human welfare, it is impossible to stand idly by. Therefore, Greater East Asia and various countries, based on their common war aims, have repeatedly stated at home and abroad the guiding principles for building a true world order.

Seven Resolutions. At the same time, in response to the attempts to obstruct and destroy the ambitions of Britain and America, reiterate the determination to temporarily concentrate all efforts to complete the war. The fundamental basis for establishing the international order should be the principles of political equality, economic reciprocity, and respect for inherent culture, abolishing all discrimination based on race, etc., and seeking co-existence and co-prosperity with harmony and cooperation as the aim. Regardless of the size of the country, its political equality must be guaranteed, and it must be given an equal opportunity for upward development. As for the form of politics, it is up to each country to choose what it wants without interference from other countries. Liberate the nations in colonial status, allowing each to be in its proper place and opening up a path for contributing to the advancement of human civilization. Eliminate the monopoly of resources, commerce, and international transportation, seek mutual economic assistance and cooperation in order to correct the imbalance in the world economy, and enable an economy that adapts to the creativity and diligence of the people of each country to flourish universally. Mutually respect the cultural traditions of each country, and at the same time, promote international harmony and human development through cultural exchange. Under the principle of non-threatening and non-aggression, eliminate armaments that threaten other countries, remove obstacles to communication, and prevent the continuous use of military force and economic means to exert pressure or instigate others. Regarding security guarantee institutions, avoid the arbitrariness of great powers and the uniform method of the whole world, and establish a security guarantee system suitable for local conditions, establish an order that can be used in conjunction with various security institutions in the world, and adapt to the constantly evolving world situation. Open up a path for changing the international order into peaceful ways.

### Thai Foreign Minister's Speech

Bangkok, 23rd (Central News Agency Telegram) - Thai Foreign Minister Srisena, recently gave a speech regarding the San Francisco Conference to be convened on the 25th, stating: Although it is impossible to predict the content of the San Francisco Conference, as far as Greater East Asia is concerned, since that area is located on the other side of the Pacific Ocean, even if there is some kind of discussion, it will not affect the Greater East Asian people. We already have the Greater East Asia Declaration, which is the path that the East Asian people should follow. The war situation has now reached a bright period. The allied nation Japan is defeating Britain and America with an indomitable spirit. Thailand expresses its deep respect and vows to advance bravely towards the path of defeating the enemy based on the common declaration.

### Speeches by the Japanese Foreign Minister and Ambassadors of Various Countries at the Meeting

Speech by the Japanese Foreign Minister

Tokyo, 23rd (Central News Agency Telegram) - At the Greater East Asia Ambassador Meeting, Japanese Foreign Minister and Greater East Asia Minister Tōgō delivered the following speech: "The modern history of East Asia is the history of Britain and America's ambition to control East Asia and the resistance of various East Asian countries against this. Britain and America, with their advanced weaponry and their ruthless cruelty and cunning, gradually achieved their ambitions, and repeatedly imposed unequal treaties on East Asian countries, further implementing policies of economic exploitation, placing East Asian peoples in a miserable fate from which they could not extricate themselves. The spirit of Japan　Nation has always taken the establishment of friendly relations with all nations as the foundation of its diplomacy, ensuring the stability of East Asia and seeking world peace. Before Japan could realize the above ideals, it was obstructed by the British and American conspiracy to invade East Asia and dominate the world. In the past, Japan advocated the abolition of racial discrimination, but was rejected by them. Britain and America also implemented their customary tactics in various East Asian countries, which led to the unfortunate China Incident. Afterwards, Britain and America focused on inciting turmoil in East Asia, while at the same time imposing military and economic pressure on Japan. Therefore, in order to protect itself and liberate and revive East Asia, Japan rose up resolutely and challenged the enemy. In short, this Greater East Asia War is the most meaningful war showing the entire East Asian national identity, and it is also a war for Japan's national survival and self-defense. As far as East Asia is concerned, the success or failure of the liberation and revival of the 1 billion people of East Asia depends on this war. As far as the world is concerned, whether a just international order of world justice and co-prosperity of all nations can be established is also related to this war. This is what the Japanese people firmly believe. Today's war situation is extremely serious. Allied Philippines and part of Burma, as well as some Japanese-controlled islands, have also been occupied by enemy forces. The Japanese mainland is also the target of their extremely inhumane indiscriminate bombing. Japan's loyal and incomparable army and brave allied soldiers are standing up to destroy the enemy's invasion, causing great sacrifices to the enemy forces. Looking at the British and American camp, they assume that the war situation is already in their favor, and are frequently extending their means of political strategy to the whole world, trampling on the autonomy and independence of neutral countries in order to expand their sphere of influence, and implementing unlimited illegal acts without any scruples. As for their war methods, they disregard human morality and specialize in inhumane and cruel methods to carry out large-scale killings and destruction. They also disregard the morality on which the civilized world is based. British and American, lacking such a sense of justice, think that they will soon win the war and are busy discussing post-war management issues. Their so-called post-war plan is to establish British and American military bases all over the world, stationing their troops, and using their great military power to monopolize the international police. As for the economic aspect, they intend to monopolize important resources and international transportation, and use the name of international cooperation to monopolize British and American politics and economy, exploit colonies, suppress backward countries, and seek the permanent prosperity of Britain and America alone. As for the political aspect, Britain and America, who profess so-called democracy and advocate racial equality, actually intend to monopolize international politics. This is clearly seen in the international security guarantee institution they are promoting. The so-called security guarantee is that they intend to use British and American cooperation to protect their own prosperity. Their so-called maintaining equality means taking the exploitation of colonies and implementing differential treatment of races as their principles. As the enemy's ambitions become increasingly clear, we should gather our total strength, insist on our determination to complete the war, and clarify that it is necessary to establish world order principles based on the trust and righteousness of the countries of Greater East Asia. Therefore, consultations have been carried out with the governments of various countries up to this day."

Speech by Ambassador Cai

Tokyo, 23rd (Central News Agency Telegram) - Our country's Ambassador Cai Pei delivered the following speech: "Since the invading demonic hands of British and American imperialism reached out to East Asia, the earliest victim was the Republic of China. After the Opium War, the poison of economic aggression became even more rampant. Father of the Nation Sun Yat-sen in writings such as "Nationalism," "Pan-Asianism," and "The Problem of China's Survival," explained their ambitions with great pain. If we do not seek liberation, we will be forever trapped in a colonial status. However, in the modern history of East Asia, the national wars of the East Asian countries resisting the oppression and trampling of British and American imperialism have become clearly evident in reality. And the current Greater East Asia War is a war for the liberation of the East Asian nations, advancing together with the allied nations. Therefore, we should continue the noble legacy of the late Chairman Wang, and we should devote our full strength to ensure the completion of this holy war. Until now, Britain and America, with their vast material resources, have sought to achieve their ambitions to conquer the world. However, the allied nation Japan, with its calm and bold spirit, has dealt them a heavy blow. Other countries are also continuing to implement various forms of cooperation from their own positions. Therefore, the late Chairman Wang once instructed us to uphold the spirit of "sharing joys and sorrows, sharing life and death" to achieve our goals. Since the Greater East Asia War, the nations that have been liberated include Burma and the Philippines. This proves that the Greater East Asia War is a war to liberate the nations of East Asia. The Greater East Asia War is a just war of the Greater East Asian nations against British and American aggression, and it can also be called a war of self-defense. Regarding China, based on the five principles of the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration, we are implementing close cooperation, gathering the total strength of Greater East Asia, and completing the Greater East Asia War in order to truly liberate the nations of Greater East Asia, to seek true world peace, and to establish a link in the new world order."

Speech by the Thai Ambassador

Tokyo, 23rd (Central News Agency Telegram) - Thai Ambassador U Chit delivered the following speech: "I hope this meeting will re-establish the principles of equality, mutual benefit, and mutual respect. We advocate that regardless of human designation and religion, independence should be supported, and the colors of colonialism and subordinate relations should be completely eliminated, driven out of the East Asian world, so that the enemy understands that our warfare is in accordance with justice and morality and can surely achieve victory. Our warfare is definitely not for revenge, let alone aversion, but to preserve our independent rights and the human status, so we should fight to the end, and believe that victory will belong to us."

Speech by the Philippine Ambassador

Tokyo, 23rd (Central News Agency Telegram) - Philippine Republic Ambassador Vargas delivered the following speech: "We Filipinos have become a free people, but in this world where selfishness and forceful destruction are rampant, the Filipinos are standing at a crossroads in history. However, I believe that the Filipinos' hearts always harbor the belief in justice and friendship. I and Laurel are equally convinced that the Filipinos must return to their original East Asian identity. This task may take ten years or even a hundred years, but the principles revealed by the Greater East Asia Declaration will surely be realized, and our ideals will surely be realized in the new world order and the free East Asian world."

Speech by Ambassador Wang

Tokyo, 23rd (Central News Agency Telegram) - Ambassador Wang of Manchukuo delivered the following speech: "The East Asian world has always been the land of our Greater East Asian nation's ancestors. Historically, for more than 6,000 years, we have enjoyed a self-sufficient life under the goals of mutual goodwill and harmony. Therefore, the nation has prospered, and the people's livelihood has been stable. However, Britain and America crossed the oceans to trample on our 1 billion people. Japan, for the survival of the Greater East Asian nation, eradicated the primary culprit and first opened fire on Britain and America. Therefore, it is not only the core of today's Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, but also the pioneer among Greater East Asian nation-states. Now that the countries of Greater East Asia have reached a critical juncture, due to the attacks of the Japanese special attack corps, the enemy forces in the Okinawa area have suffered heavy damage, so there is no doubt that the final victory will belong to us. When the Greater East Asia War broke out, my Emperor said that the relationship between Japan and Manchukuo is one of life and death and cannot be separated. Our country's officials and people have taken this imperial edict to heart, pouring total effort in both material and mental aspects to enhance productivity. Therefore, the military industry is becoming more prosperous, and agricultural products have also been abundant in recent years, completing the mission of the so-called Greater East Asia military base. Our country, recognizing this important mission, is willing to fight and strive together with all countries. The survival of the billion people in Greater East Asia depends on this war. The war aims of the Japanese Empire are to liberate the Greater East Asian nations. The countries of Greater East Asia, recognizing this, are reciprocally engaging with sincerity, advancing towards the path of completing the war."

Commentary

### The New World Situation

— Yang Guangzheng

— Revised Manuscript of a Speech at the New Association Shanghai Branch's Current Affairs Lecture. Three Standpoints Should Be Adopted When Observing the World Situation: First, an objective standpoint, that is, making judgments based on facts, without prejudice or emotion, in order to arrive at correct conclusions. Second, a progressive standpoint; regarding the evolution of the situation, infer using the dialectical method instead of the mechanical method. One must understand that the factors of situational changes are very complex and tortuous, and definitely not simple matters; however, where there is change, there is progress. Third, a Chinese standpoint. We are Chinese, so we should understand how various changes affect China and how to utilize these changes to achieve China's independence, freedom, and equality. Second, in observing the current situation, there should be two basic understandings: First, war is a continuation of politics. Political changes are sufficient to affect changes in the war situation, and can even change the nature of the war. Second, the current war is a triangular struggle, that is, the struggle between the Axis countries, the capitalist countries, and the communist countries, and not simply a two-sided war. Therefore, the development of the war is particularly complex and full of changes.

Let us first talk about the European situation: In the middle of last month, the Soviet army had continued its offensive to reach Steder, 125 miles northeast of Berlin, and Kustrin, 60 miles to the east, Frankfurt, 76 miles to the southeast, and Lauben, 70 miles to the south, forming an arc-shaped encirclement of Berlin. At that time, the British and American forces on the Western Front were still fighting in the Rhine region, more than 450 miles from Berlin. In order to defend Berlin, the German army transferred a large force to the Eastern Front to resist the Soviet army, thus allowing the British and American forces to advance eastward. At this time, the Soviet army could have directly attacked Berlin, but unexpectedly shifted its offensive focus to the south, seizing Vienna, the capital of Austria, and advancing towards Czechoslovakia. Why is this? There are three major reasons: 1. The Soviet army attacking Berlin alone would inevitably suffer heavy casualties. In order to make the British and American forces share the sacrifice, the Soviet Union remained inactive. 2. The Soviet army attacking Berlin alone would arouse greater hatred among Germans towards the Soviet Union, which would be a political mistake. 3. Taking advantage of the fact that the British and American forces had not yet penetrated the heart of Germany, seizing other regions of Europe.

In recent months, the British and American forces on the Western Front have invaded Hamburg in the north, occupied Hanover and Magdeburg in the north-central region, and occupied Leipzig in the south. They could have directly attacked Berlin from the central route, but afterwards, the British and American forces suddenly captured Dresden in the southeast of Leipzig and broke into Czechoslovakia from Hof. When the British and American forces approached Berlin, the Soviet army launched a major offensive against Berlin, launching a battle for Berlin (according to a dispatch on the 22nd, the Soviet army had broken into Berlin, while the American forces were still 80 miles away from Berlin). This indicates that while the British and Americans and the Soviet Union were fighting Germany together, they were also competing for territory in Europe, that is, competing for future hegemony in Europe.

The competition for European territory between Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union did not start today. Last autumn, when the Soviet army was approaching Warsaw, it suddenly shifted its offensive to the Balkans, encompassing Romania, Bulgaria, and Yugoslavia. At the same time, the British army, which was fighting in France, also moved a portion of its troops to land in Albania and Greece. As a result, a direct conflict occurred between the Greek left-wing army and the British army. This is one example. Another example is that before the outbreak of the European war, Britain and France intended to promote a war between Germany and the Soviet Union. Unexpectedly, Germany and the Soviet Union suddenly signed an agreement, prompting the war between the Axis powers and Britain and France. Subsequently, Germany's power expanded greatly, and the Soviet Union implemented anti-German defense, resulting in the German-Soviet war. From this, it can be seen that both Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union want to consume the strength of other countries in order to expand their own countries. Currently, Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union are temporarily united because they have the same goals against Germany. Assuming that Berlin falls, Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union will each want to establish a new German regime, which will cause infighting. Further assuming that the European war ends, and the common object and unifying factors between Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union disappear, then their contradictions may tend to expand again.

The contradictions between Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union can also be seen in the San Francisco Conference, which will be convened soon. For example, the issues of Poland's participation and voting rights have already been reported in the newspapers, so I will not elaborate further. Since Roosevelt's death and Truman's succession as president, the Soviet Union suddenly changed Molotov as the chief representative attending the San Francisco Conference. This may have been due to the United States' request, but it was also to have Molotov go and observe the American tendencies under the new president and to urge the United States not to change Roosevelt's policies. From this, one can see the Soviet Union's concerns about the United States.

In short, the Soviet Union and Britain and the United States have different national policies, different political systems, and different interests, so their fundamental contradictions always exist. If the contradictions expand, it will cause disputes.

Next, let's talk about the East Asian situation: From the landing of American troops on Leyte Island on October 20 last year to the fall of Manila at the end of February this year, the Philippine battle is still ongoing. On February 17, American troops landed on Iwo Jima in the Ogasawara Islands, and the battle ended on March 17. Then, on April 1, American troops crossed Taiwan and landed on Okinawa Island, the main island of the Ryukyu Islands, and fierce fighting is still ongoing. The results of the battle have been reported in the newspapers, and the battle situation is quite tense. However, if Britain and the United States want to win, they must invade the Japanese mainland and the Chinese mainland. However, in war, the attacking party will inevitably suffer great sacrifices, this is one; the Japanese army's defenses on the mainland and the mainland are far more active and stronger than the defenses on the surrounding small islands, this is two; in modern three-dimensional warfare, the damage suffered by implementing a landing operation is far greater than other offensive operations, this is three; from the snail-like advance of the British and American troops after landing in Italy and the slow progress after landing in northern France, people have doubts about the combat capabilities of the British and American armies, this is four; also, if the British and American troops want to attack the Japanese mainland in the future, they must first occupy other small islands in southern Japan; if they want to attack the Chinese mainland, they must occupy the Zhoushan Islands east of Hangzhou Bay or Jeju Island in southern Korea. But remember, it took four or five months for the American army to invade the Philippines and it hasn't ended yet, and Iwo Jima is a very small island, and it took more than a month to occupy; in the future, if they go deeper into the Japanese Inland Sea, then the Japanese counterattack will be even more stubborn. Therefore, the East Asian war situation will be protracted.

So, will the Soviet Union help Britain and the United States in East Asia? It is true that the Soviet Union has announced that it will not extend the Japanese-Soviet Neutrality Pact in exchange for concessions from Britain and the United States at the San Francisco Conference. However, the Japanese-Soviet Neutrality Pact still has one year of validity, and Japan, in order to maintain or even improve Japanese-Soviet relations, has appointed Togo, who is well-versed in the Soviet Union, as Foreign Minister. Therefore, Japanese-Soviet relations will not deteriorate in this year, and assuming that the European war ends, the factors that prompted the alliance between Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union will disappear, and the realist Stalin will certainly not be exploited by Britain and the United States on the East Asian issue. Moreover, if Britain and the United States can restore their hegemonic rights in East Asia, then from Western Europe through the Mediterranean coast and Southwest Asia to the Chinese mainland under the rule of Chongqing, and to the Aleutian Islands and Alaska, all will be under the control of Britain and the United States, forming a large encirclement of the Soviet Union, which is not what the Soviet Union wants to see.

Therefore, assuming that the European war ends, there are two possible attitudes of the Soviet Union: one is that because it has suffered heavy sacrifices in the European war, it urgently seeks rest and revival, then it will not interfere in the East Asian war, allowing Britain and the United States and Japan to consume each other. In this way, the East Asian war may be prolonged. However, the third world war between capitalist countries and communist countries will break out sooner or later. If the Soviet Union intends to take advantage of this war to destroy capitalist countries all over the world, then it may transform the Second World War and launch the Third World War immediately. At present, Japan's controlled economy, political mobilization of the whole people, and foreign anti-imperialist policies have already deviated from the character of capitalism; so if the contradictions between Britain and the United States and the Soviet Union are expanded, then a Japanese-Soviet alliance, or even a Eurasian alliance, to implement an anti-imperialist war is not impossible. At that time, the war has already changed its nature, and class struggles may break out within Britain and the United States, causing great chaos, which is also not impossible.

The above are just speculations and cannot be regarded as a conclusion; however, the world situation does not simply move forward in a straight line, but will go through many twists and turns before the results can be seen, which is a roughly accurate principle. In this world of twists and turns, what about China?

The goal of the Chinese revolution for a hundred years has been to seek independence internationally, democracy politically, and symbiosis economically; therefore, we must overthrow imperialism, eliminate feudal remnants, and curb capitalism. In recent years, Japan has determined a new policy towards China due to the tight war situation. If the situation becomes more serious in the future, Japan must gradually implement the new policy of equality and mutual benefit in order to win China's cooperation. Since the character of the Japanese state has changed, our nation's enemies will be the various imperialist countries of Britain and the United States; only by overthrowing all imperialism can we eliminate the feudal remnants and capitalist forces under the cover of imperialism, and only then can we complete the Chinese revolution! On this point, China and Japan have a real need for cooperation and mutual assistance. Furthermore, this world war has weakened the power of various imperialist countries due to consumption, so it is a good opportunity for China to complete the revolution. However, if we want to achieve the goal of the revolution, we must rely on our own strength. Therefore, the people of the whole country should unite, work hard, and struggle together to complete national independence, political democracy, and economic equality!

### Japanese Air Force Fiercely Attacks Enemy Ships and Bombs Okinawa North and Central Airfields

Central Pacific Base, 23rd (Central News Agency Telegram) – On the evening of the 20th, the Japanese air force fiercely attacked groups of large enemy ships south of Kerama Island. Another air squadron bombed the northern and central airfields that night. On the night of the 21st, they again raided the airfields, dropping numerous bombs. Another squadron attacked enemy ships on the eastern peninsula. At dawn on the 22nd, they sank a large transport ship in the waters off Kadena. The Japanese air force's fierce fighting from the 21st to the 22nd was visible from the land. Each attack resulted in dozens of large explosions. On the 22nd, over 300 enemy aircraft attacked Okinawa Island. Japanese squadrons also launched attacks on enemy fleets east of the archipelago on the afternoon of the 22nd.

### Okinawa Island Recent Battle Situation

Central News Agency Report – Regarding the recent battle situation on Okinawa Island, according to news from military observers in this city, the enemy American forces, four miles from Naha, announced a halt two weeks ago. However, since the 19th of this month, the enemy American forces have launched a general counter-offensive, and the battle situation is quite intense. The American 7th Division on the east coast has shown a slight advancing trend, while in the central area, the enemy American 9th and 16th Divisions are currently encountering fierce Japanese attacks, and the enemy is unable to cross the line. On the west coast, the enemy American 27th Division is near Makiminato, and the enemy's false reports that they have occupied a portion of it have not been confirmed to this day, which shows that their reports are inaccurate. According to a statement made by the enemy commander, the operations on the island require extremely large sacrifices and a great deal of bloodshed for every small step forward, which shows the slow progress of the enemy forces. Near Minatogawa in southern Okinawa Island, the enemy used naval gun fire, but the Japanese army bravely repelled them at sea. The operations in southern Okinawa Island have become increasingly fierce in recent days, and through the Japanese army's courageous annihilation, the enemy's attempt to advance has been shattered. The battle situation in the Motobu Peninsula area has recently become fierce. On the one hand, Japanese special attack forces have continuously launched fierce attacks on the enemy, and the losses of the enemy forces attacking in that area have gradually increased. In particular, the Japanese special attack forces are brave in killing the enemy, and the American army is extremely afraid.

### Thorough Overhaul of Manchukuo's Agricultural Administration Structure

Xinjing, 23rd (Central News Agency Telegram) – The Manchukuo government, in view of the importance of agricultural administration in the current situation, has decided to overhaul and strengthen the structure of agricultural administration, which will be implemented from May 1. The focus of this structural overhaul is to abolish the Forestry Bureau and the Horse Administration Bureau and establish a new Forestry Department and Livestock Department in order to comprehensively manage forestry and livestock production. As much as possible, the central authority of agricultural promotion administration will be transferred to the local level, and a decisive agricultural promotion administration system will be established. After the Forestry Bureau is abolished, the matters under its jurisdiction will be completely entrusted to the provinces and counties, with the aim of expanding local forestry public corporations. The central government will maintain close ties between the administrative department and the public corporations. The Forestry Department of the Central Agricultural Promotion Department will set up six sections for forest administration, timber, firewood, resin control, and afforestation to manage the matters under the jurisdiction of the former Forestry Bureau. In addition, forestry bureaus will be established in the Eastern Manchurian General Province, Xing'an General Province, Jilin, Sanjiang, Tonghua, and Jian Dao provinces, forestry sections will be established in Binjiang, Beian, and Heihe provinces, and forestry sections will be newly established in Eastern An Province and Northern Xing'an Province. In addition, forestry offices will be established under the planning of the forestry public corporations, and the government will guide and supervise the forestry public corporations to implement production plans. The Livestock Department will set up five sections for livestock production, feed, livestock, and hygiene, and the remaining personnel will be transferred to other places to strengthen local administrative institutions. New livestock sections will be established in Jilin, Beian, and other three provinces, and technical experts in charge of livestock will be set up in other important provinces to promote livestock production in order to promote the purchase of livestock products.

Goebbels stated that Berlin citizens who raise white flags or use cowardly attitudes to cause unrest or anxiety in the resistance during this period will be subject to the most severe punishment for this crime. The German authorities will immediately arrest such traitors if they are discovered. All Berlin citizens have the responsibility to defend their residences.

### Air Defense Headquarters Encourages the Digging of Air Defense Wells Can be Used During Air Raids and Peacetime

The Citizen Air Defense Headquarters, in order to prevent water supply from being cut off in the event of an air raid, which would have a huge impact on firefighting, as well as the citizen's drinking water, has decided to encourage the digging of air defense wells, instructing each branch bureau, district, and joint guarantee to dig these wells. Not only can it cope with emergencies, but also use well water in peacetime to save tap water. Recently, companies that dig these earthen wells have been established one after another, like bamboo shoots after rain, and have posted advertisements to solicit business. Among them, there are inevitably speculators who mix in. The Air Defense Section of the Police Bureau has separately summoned each well-digging company for talks. The methods, depth, and prices of well-digging have all been reviewed. They must be reasonably ideal. Some have been reviewed and deemed qualified, and each branch bureau and joint guarantee has been notified to entrust these companies to dig.

### This Period's Household Flour to be Distributed Within Days Price Adjusted to 400 Yuan Per Jin

Regarding the distribution of household flour in this city, the Shanghai District Flour and Bran Unified Allocation Office has consulted with the Flour and Wheat Control Association and decided to issue a portion soon, which will continue to be distributed within days. The amount of household flour allocated for this period will still be one jin (second-class flour) per person, and the distribution price will be 400 yuan, an increase of 300% compared to the original distribution price. It is reported that the adjustment of the distribution price of household flour this time has been discussed several times by the Flour and Wheat Association and the Flour and Bran Unified Allocation Office, and the adjustment standard has been determined based on the reasonable principle of not increasing the burden on the common people. The association and office believe that household flour is a necessary food for the general public, and the distribution price should not increase with general commodity prices. Therefore, in the past few months, the price has not been adjusted hastily, and the original distribution price has been maintained. However, due to the repeated increase in the purchase price of wheat since last year and the beginning of this year, the cost of flour production has increased more and more. If the original distribution price is still used, the losses will be huge. Therefore, after repeated consideration, the distribution price has been revised from the lowest standard. After this adjustment of the distribution price, the distribution of household flour will continue to be maintained without interruption. As for the distribution of special flour for various industries, the office is also preparing to continue to handle it.

They will only be allowed to resume business after the fine is paid in full.

Oil Extraction Industry

### Investigation of the Edible Oil Industry in Shanghai

— Jia Xi

The sources of edible oil in Shanghai have traditionally been dominated by Datong soybean oil and Qingniao raw oil. Recently, due to difficulties in shipping routes, large quantities of oil have not arrived in Shanghai for a long time. There are currently two sources: one is that vendors purchase in small quantities from Nantong, Dongtai, Taixian, Bengbu, Wuxi, Changzhou, and other places; the other is that oil is transported from Shandong by sailboats to Wusong and Liuhe, and then transferred to Shanghai. Although Bengbu has abundant oil production, the arrival of goods is scarce due to poor fire transport.

Before the war, Shanghai was also a center for oil extraction, with more than 20 oil extraction factories and a total of more than 5,000 workers. In terms of sales, soybean oil was sold nationwide, raw oil was sold to South China, coconut oil was sold to local soap factories, and cotton oil was sold to the United States. In terms of oil cakes, soybean cake was sold to Guangdong, Xiamen, Oil Head and other places, followed by the line from Beijing, Shanghai and Hangzhou; rapeseed cake, cotton cake, and coconut cake were mainly sold in Japan, followed by South American countries, which is completely opposite to the current situation.

Oil Extraction Industry

The situation of each oil extraction factory in Shanghai is described below:

Tongchang Oil Factory, located in Nanmatou, has a history of more than 40 years and is the oldest oil factory in Shanghai. It produces soybean cake and cottonseed cake. The factory has more than 100 employees, mostly from Tongzhou, followed by Shaoxing and Ningbo, and not many from Northern Jiangsu. It has been shut down for a long time.

Dayouyu Oil Factory, the largest oil factory in Shanghai, has a history of more than 30 years. When it is fully operational, it has more than 1,000 workers. Now it only has more than 100 workers. It can produce more than 800 catties of soybean oil per day, more than 800 pieces, more than 800 catties of cottonseed oil, and more than 400 dan of cake. Now, due to the lack of raw materials, production has been greatly reduced.

Dade Xinshan Factory was established not long ago, and its products are of excellent quality. It has four sets of cottonseed presses and nearly 100 workers. It can produce more than 800 catties of oil and more than 400 dan of cake per day.

Lide Oil Factory was founded more than 30 years ago, has more than 300 workers, and has 12 sets of cottonseed presses and 4 sets of coconut presses. Coconut oil is the most famous, and peanut oil is also good, but the soybean cake business is sluggish and has fallen into a state of shutdown.

Dachang Oil Factory had more than 300 workers at its peak, producing soybean cake, cottonseed cake, coconut cake, etc. It has more than 80 sets of soybean cake presses and 8 sets of peanut presses.

Defeng Oil Factory has more than 200 employees and only makes soybean cake. It can produce 6,000 pieces of soybean cake per day. It has more than 40 manual presses and 40 electric presses.

Hengxingtai Oil Factory has more than 200 employees and 8 presses. Peanut oil is very famous. There are now more than 100 employees, and the presses are not fully operational.

Changde Oil Factory had more than 300 employees at its peak, with more than 50 soybean cake presses and 8 cottonseed presses. It now operates four cottonseed presses and has fewer than 100 employees.

Dade Oil Factory has more than 100 employees and has 60 to 70 presses, specializing in soybean cake.

Current Situation of Supply and Demand

Due to the war and widespread economic panic, the oil extraction industry has been repeatedly hit and has completely fallen into bankruptcy. Now only Dayouyu, Dachang Xin, Dade Xin, Dasheng and other four companies are self-operated, and the rest are either managed by the military or leased by commercial banks. The four self-operated companies are almost completely shut down due to lack of raw materials and electricity restrictions. The raw materials for oil production include soybeans, cottonseed, peanuts, rapeseed, and hemp. Soybeans, peanuts, and sesame seeds come from Northeast China, North China, and other places. Now, due to transportation difficulties, the arrival of goods is very scarce. Rapeseed and cottonseed are produced along the Shanghai-Hangzhou Road, the Beijing-Shanghai Road, and in Chongming and Northern Jiangsu, but due to inconvenient transportation, the arrival of goods is also very limited.

In the past, the monthly demand for edible oil in Shanghai was about 4 million catties, but now, due to the weak purchasing power of citizens, it only needs more than 2 million catties per month. If 4 million citizens are evenly distributed, each person consumes half a catty of oil per month. Since electricity restrictions, every household has added one or two soybean oil lamps, which has increased the consumption of edible oil by more than 800,000 catties.

Guild Market

The edible oil industry originally had the Miscellaneous Grain and Oil Cake Industry Association. In 1931, Xinglai Industry jointly formed an association, named the Shanghai Special City Wheat Miscellaneous Grain and Oil Cake Industry Association. In 1932, it was reorganized into the Shanghai District Edible Oil Industry Association, covering the urban area and the seven counties of Shenjiang, Fengxian, Nanhui, Chuansha, Jiading, Baoshan, and Chongming under the jurisdiction of the city. Later, due to the special circumstances of Jiading, it was excluded. The vegetable oil market used to be located on the upper floors of No. 15 Dasha Hai Road. Last year, due to the prohibition of futures trading, the Oil and Grain Industry Association temporarily ordered it to be suspended, and it has not yet been restored. As a result, most oil merchants trade on the road and there is no fixed market. There are many reasons for the formation of the black market for edible oil: 1. Transportation difficulties make it impossible to transport raw materials or finished products. Now, most of them are brought by single workers. 2. Reduced production due to the increasing poverty of morning villages, heavy donations and taxes, and purchase prices that are not enough to cover costs, so the production of beans, peanuts, sesame seeds, etc. is not good. 3. Factory electricity is restricted, and Shanghai cannot produce in large quantities. 4. Edible oil in neighboring counties is not price-limited, which causes the edible oil that has arrived in the near suburbs of Shanghai to flow to neighboring counties, resulting in a situation where there is no oil on the market.

### Municipal Schools Exempted from House Tax

In May of last year, the municipal government drafted three measures for schools to pay house tax and miscellaneous taxes, the first of which stipulated: "Municipal or private schools that are registered with the Bureau of Education shall still pay land and house tax. If they request subsidies, they may be subsidized according to the amount of house tax payable after submitting a request and obtaining approval." Since the promulgation and implementation of this measure, the Bureau of Education has repeatedly received reports from municipal schools and has been notified by the Bureau of Finance that they must pay house tax. It is heard that the Bureau of Education, in view of the fact that the funds for municipal schools are allocated by the municipal government, if they submit another request to the government for funds to pay the tax, it will not only be a frequent procedure, but also will not benefit the municipal treasury tax revenue. It is heard that the municipal government has now approved the revision of the first half of the first measure to: "Municipal schools are exempt from house tax across the board," and ordered the Bureau of Finance and the Finance Committee to be informed.

### Teachers Who Illegally Receive Rationed Rice - Principals Must Also Be Punished

Recently, the relevant authorities have discovered several cases of employees of private schools illegally receiving rationed rice. After distinguishing the severity of each case, the relevant teachers and staff members were punished. The details have been reported in various newspapers in the city on March 28. It is learned that the Bureau of Education has received an order from the municipal government that if teachers and staff members of various schools illegally receive rationed rice again in the future, not only will the person concerned be punished, but the principals of the relevant schools will also be given an additional punishment.

The exchange rate is also based on the original amount. The ratio between the United Reserve Bank [聯銀] and the Reserve Currency [儲幣] is still 18 yuan for 100 yuan, with no change.

Salt Administration Tightens Anti-Smuggling:

The Songjiang District Salt Affairs Administration of the Ministry of Finance has established an investigation team this month, divided into three groups, to carry out anti-smuggling work in Pudong, Jiading, Luodian, Taicang, Fengxian, Shenjiang, Songjiang, and other places near Shanghai, and strictly limit the price of table salt. Those who violate the regulations will be dealt with severely.

Rubber Industry Lacks Raw Materials:

The rubber raw materials and products industry in the city has been in a slump due to the interruption of raw material supply and the failure to restore electricity adjustment. It is reported that the Rubber Industry Association has requested the authorities to solve the raw material and electricity needs at the request of its members, but no reply has been received so far, so that the manufacturers have been in a state of suspension. As for some manufacturers who can still produce and sell products, their raw materials are all sought on the black market, and the cost is high. In terms of sales, it has also decreased recently, because the goods that have been hoarded in the past have been released, and the selling price is lower than the official price set by the authorities. There is no profit to be made from the newly produced rubber products.

Reader's Scholarship News

### Free Treatment Guidelines for Students Aided by This Newspaper - Entrusted to Five Hospitals - Must Register with School Registration Certificate

In order to improve the health of poor students, the office of the reader's scholarship of this newspaper has allocated 1 million yuan from the interest of the scholarship as "Medical Expenses for Assisted Students", and has selected five hospitals in the urban area with suitable locations and complete equipment, and entrusted them to handle the treatment of assisted students. It has been decided to start the implementation from today. The regulations are as follows:

The 1 million yuan that this office will propose from the interest of the scholarship will be pre-allocated to the following five hospitals on average: No. 363 Huashan Road, First Hospital of the Red Cross; No. 361 Lane Datong Road, Hongren Hospital; No. 125 Taoyuan Road, Siming Hospital; No. 1 Nantong Road, Nanyang Hospital; No. 197 Huangshan Road, Guangci Hospital.

When students who have been assisted by this newspaper hold their student status and go to the above hospitals for treatment, they must check their residence permit (because the student card does not have a photo) to ensure that there are no errors, then all outpatient and necessary diagnosis fees will be paid by this office, that is, each hospital will credit it to the pre-allocated funds in this office, but the hospitalization fee and all medicine fees will be paid by the students themselves.

At the beginning of the treatment, this office will print free treatment monthly reports and send them to each hospital. The symptoms and treatment of the students will be filled in item by item, and sent to this office for review at the end of each month and published in the newspaper.

When the pre-allocated medical expenses are exhausted, we can discuss follow-up methods based on the situation.

The above measures will be implemented from April 20, 1945.

### Marine Art Exhibition Call for Paintings

Consumption Surcharge

Question about Payment by Third Tenants

This office received a letter from a third tenant reader asking about the water fee deposit issue. The original letter said: "The water fee of each household in our alley (No. 403 Changyang Road) has always been included in the rent by the landlord. Recently, the water company urged to increase the deposit, so the landlord informed the second tenants that each household must pay a deposit of 3,500 yuan, and the second tenants calculated it according to the registered population in this household and collected it from the third tenants, which has not been resolved for several days. It is found that this dispute is not limited to our alley, so it is worth discussing whether the deposit should be jointly borne by the third tenants, and whether it can be recovered when moving out in the future. I dare to raise it and want to discuss it with those who care about social undertakings." (According to this office, if the tenant and the landlord specify in the lease contract that the water fee is included, the landlord should be responsible in principle. It is an exception if the tenant agrees to share it with the landlord, but it cannot be forcibly shared. If it is shared, the landlord should refund it to the tenant when moving out, because the deposit receipt is held by the landlord. Recently, the water and electricity deposit has often been increased. In order to avoid causing disputes, it seems that the construction authorities should specify a method to avoid disputes.

### Military Review at Tongshan—Fifth Installment of Travels in the Huaihai Region —

— Yifei

On the morning of the seventh day of the month, the reporter hurried to the provincial government office, responding to Governor Hao's invitation to a field visit. Upon arriving at the gate, Mr. Hao was already waiting. The car passed through the urban area and Qingyun Township. The Japanese residents encountered along the way all took off their hats to salute Governor Hao's car as it passed, even the children, demonstrating the usual harmonious relationship between them. After about five minutes, the car exited the North Gate. The road was not very smooth. Along the way, many villagers led small donkeys, carrying wheat to Xuzhou, forming groups. Most notable were the unique ox carts. These carts had four large iron wheels and were pulled by three or four oxen. According to Mr. Xue Jizi, the magistrate of Tongshan County, who was traveling with the reporter, Tongshan County alone had three thousand of these ox carts.

After about fifteen minutes, we passed through a road cut through the mountain, and then passed Pingshankou, where blockhouses stood densely along the way. According to Mr. Hao, the Huaihai military has always adopted a steady and solid approach to military affairs. Currently, over 1,170 blockhouses have been built. In addition to tall gun towers and observation posts, the surroundings of each blockhouse are fortified with complete fortifications. A certain number of troops are stationed in each blockhouse, equipped with enough food for ten to fifteen days. Every ten to fifteen days, replacements arrive and the previous troops are transferred elsewhere to prevent them from becoming lax over time.

We passed Xiaogushan, Shitun, and Gucheng, arriving at a [illegible] area in Tongshan County. The car stopped to the sound of military music. After getting out of the car, Mr. Hao immediately inspected the fortifications, giving instructions. The [illegible] area is an important stronghold in Huaihai Province, with an area of about two [illegible], 400 households, a population of 4,500, and about 2,500 able-bodied men. The residents are all engaged in commerce. There is a central elementary school in the village with 250 students, all of whom are admitted free of charge.

At 10:00 AM, the formal review began. Thousands of energetic and spirited soldiers stood in the center of the field. After Mr. Hao ascended the reviewing stand, the regimental commander issued commands and the review began. The most interesting part was the drill of the bayonet squad and the mortar team, whose actions were swift and the scene was very realistic. Mr. Hao went down from the platform to personally inspect the maintenance of their machine guns and cannons to ensure they were in good condition. He also ordered the weapons to be disassembled on the spot to test their technical skills, and earnestly instructed them that the quality of the machinery team was crucial to the safety of all the troops, and that they must protect and cherish them carefully.

After four hours, the entire review was completed. Mr. Hao selected the best to reward and promote. Afterwards, he addressed the entire group, outlining his five key principles for governing the army, which can be summarized as follows:

Protect the common people: During this time of war, it is the time for soldiers to devote themselves to serving the country. They should take extra care to protect the common people and help each other, so that they can become an army that defends the country and protects the people. Any violation will not be tolerated. For example, recently, the head of the special service team of a certain unit stationed in Xiaoxian County, Mr. Tu, was executed for borrowing civilian goods and refusing to return them after relying on his power, after the public made accusations. His superiors were also detained for negligent supervision. Do not suffer defeats: The disparity in weaponry between us and the enemy is vast, and the strength of the enemy compared to us is ten to one. In the battle in Xiaoxian County last month, in addition to seizing war spoils, an enemy brigade commander was killed. Therefore, in future battles, you should bravely advance and return in triumph. I do not wish to see any defeated soldiers who disgrace the military's reputation. Do not surrender: Even in difficult situations, we should strive for final victory. If there is no other option, we must sacrifice ourselves to preserve the honor of the military. For example, in the battle of Xiajiayu the week before last, the Banzun stronghold was besieged for four days. Despite the enemy's threats and inducements to surrender, they were unmoved. Zhang Fuying, a squad leader, managed to escape at risk and obtain reinforcements. Their cooperation from the inside and outside ultimately enabled them to complete their mission and break through the encirclement. Do not surrender your weapons: “One’s head can be severed, but the weapon cannot be surrendered." In the previous great battle with the enemy, our side used one thousand men to defeat four thousand, and managed to hold out until the last five minutes, driving all the enemies out of the country. This victory can strengthen our faith in future battles. Do not desert: Desertion is a great shame and disgrace to a soldier. Soldiers should take pride in being able to endure hardship. Finally, Mr. Hao elaborated on his advocacy of "death education," which is: Fearlessness of death: Being afraid on the battlefield is the most foolish thing. According to the bullet velocity, it travels at 400 meters per minute, while a person can only run a few dozen steps, so fleeing is useless. I die, the enemy also dies: If there is no other option, one should have the determination to perish together with the enemy. The enemy dies, but I do not: This is the ideal that should be exhibited by a well-trained soldier, and it is also the best strategy in battle.

The address concluded in cheers. Mr. Hao then summoned his officers to the regimental headquarters for a simple lunch. During the meal, Mr. Hao repeatedly stressed the importance of soldiers' hygiene as the weather was getting warmer. He also inquired from District Chief Shi Yingzhou about whether the local troops had been disturbing the people. It was evident that Mr. Hao was concerned about the welfare of the people.

After the meal, we set off to return to Xuzhou. When the car passed [illegible] Township, Mr. Hao stopped the car to observe the local defense works. Multiple fortresses were built on the mountains, guarded day and night by troops. It was truly an important military location. After the inspection, we continued on, encountering a large cavalry unit between Xiaogushan. They were waving flags and galloping their horses between the willow trees and wheat fields, speeding past like the wind. When we arrived in Xuzhou City, the sun was already setting. The slogan "Obedience, Sacrifice, Unity, Mutual Assistance" on the wall of the [illegible] regimental headquarters, and the heroic figures of the thousands of Chinese soldiers responsible for maintaining security in the Huaihai region, still floated in my mind.
