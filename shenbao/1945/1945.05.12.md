### Fierce Battles Unfolding in the South and West Coast

Tokyo, November 11th, Central News Agency dispatch – Since April 26th, when the enemy forces launched their second general offensive against the southern front of Okinawa Island, they have suffered heavy casualties due to the courageous resistance of the Japanese army. By the end of April, the enemy's plans were frustrated, but their will to fight remained strong. In May, after receiving reinforcements of personnel and supplies, the enemy attempted to break through the Japanese lines north of Shuri, launching repeated and intense attacks. Although the enemy's naval power has been severely damaged by continuous attacks from the Japanese air force, they are willing to reinforce their troops and supplies in order to maintain their current strategic advantage of securing maritime supply lines and to destroy the Japanese counter-attack power in the short term. At the same time, after the end of the European war, they intend to use the Okinawa operation as an opportunity to advance further and create the impression of smooth progress in U.S. military operations in the Greater East Asia War to China and abroad. Therefore, the enemy's offensive has intensified since the morning of the 9th. On the morning of the 10th, powerful enemy units, under the cover of tanks, launched attacks from the south of Shuri towards the south of Maeda and the Anbocha area. At that time, the Japanese defenders immediately engaged them in fierce battles. Simultaneously, the enemy also launched an offensive on the west coast. At around 6:00 AM on the 10th, the enemy began a river crossing battle at the Anza River in front of Anza Village (3 kilometers north of Naha), a strategic point, using about 40 boats. By 7:30 AM, the enemy was repelled after suffering heavy blows from the Japanese defenders. Subsequently, at around 11:30 AM, under the cover of intense artillery fire, the enemy mobilized amphibious tanks and began another river crossing operation at the Anza River. At present, both sides are engaged in fierce battles on the east and west lines of Anza Village. Consequently, the confrontation between the Japanese and U.S. forces on the southern front on the 10th stretches from Gasa on the east coast, through Xinji Maeda, to Anza on the west coast, a front line of approximately eight kilometers. Currently, both sides are engaged in repeated fierce battles.

Comprehensive Japanese Battle Results

Furthermore, from the enemy's landing until April 29th, when the enemy's second offensive was frustrated, the Japanese army achieved the following battle results: 22,100 enemy killed, 325 tanks abandoned and destroyed, and 102 artillery pieces of various types destroyed. Subsequently, in the nine days until May 7th, the Japanese army confirmed the following battle results in battle: 12,600 enemy killed, 134 tanks abandoned and destroyed, and 39 artillery pieces of various types destroyed. If the enemy's landing forces are totalled since they began offensive, then the Japanese army on land has caused the enemy the loss of 34,700 killed, 459 tanks abandoned and destroyed, and 140 artillery pieces of various types destroyed, with total enemy landing force casualties representing one third of their troops. Since the enemy forces began their new offensive on the 9th, given advantageous terrain and harmony, before the Japanese defense line's fierce counter offensive, their casualties will become increasingly greater. Also, after the weather improves, Japanese special attack squadrons, air force units, and submarines will fully exert their power in courageous attacks on enemy warships and airfields around the island. On the evening of the 9th, it was confirmed from land that enemy warships were subjected to fierce attacks by Japanese special attack aircraft, resulting in the sinking of one submarine and one cruiser. At the same time, two ships of unknown type were destroyed and set ablaze.

### The Relationship Between Jiangsu Province and Shanghai Municipality

Shanghai is a special municipality, but in general terms, it is the heart of Jiangsu Province. In military, political, economic, and cultural aspects, all movements in Shanghai are sufficient to affect Jiangsu Province and even the entire Central China region. Therefore, governing Jiangsu Province must start from the perspective of Shanghai; and governing Shanghai must also start from the perspective of Jiangsu Province. The division between the province and the special municipality is formal; in practice, one cannot hold territorial prejudices. When the provincial governor came to Shanghai last month, his speeches at the welcome banquet hosted by various sectors of the city, as well as his discussions with leaders from all walks of life, demonstrated a clear understanding of the close relationship between the province and the city, and he held many wise views. In particular, regarding the various concrete problems that Shanghai urgently needs to solve today, he was able to base his actions on this understanding and demonstrate his determination to weather the storm together, which is truly worthy of praise.

Although there are many undertakings that Shanghai urgently needs to carry out, the most important are: first, the implementation of wartime population evacuation; second, the development of Shanghai's industries in various parts of Jiangsu Province; third, the establishment of agricultural loans; fourth, the construction of the Jiangsu-Shanghai highway, etc. These matters are directly related to the urgent problems that Shanghai needs to solve, and indirectly closely related to the political and economic situation of Jiangsu Province. Therefore, both sides should not hold any territorial prejudices, but should do their part and actively promote these undertakings.

First, regarding the issue of population evacuation, although the authorities of Jiangsu Province and the responsible parties in Shanghai have cooperated since its inception, it has not yet achieved results, and the phenomenon of overpopulation remains serious. If evacuation is not actively promoted, unnecessary sacrifices will be made once air raids become rampant, which is truly not worthwhile. Moreover, the large labor force in Shanghai can be evacuated in a planned manner to various parts of Jiangsu Province to assist in the province's development and construction, which is also of great significance. However, issues such as transportation, local security, and supplies all require more active and closer cooperation between the responsible authorities in Jiangsu and Shanghai.

Second, regarding industrial evacuation, today, Shanghai's various industries are unable to operate due to electricity, fuel, and raw material problems, and are at a standstill. Many manufacturers are facing difficulties due to increasing expenses, and are struggling to survive by reducing capital or laying off employees. The number of unemployed people is increasing, and the social crisis is worsening. If Shanghai falls into a state of war, everything will be destroyed, and recovery will not be easy. Therefore, Shanghai entrepreneurs should not wait and see, but should decisively move to various parts of Jiangsu Province and make plans to break up their businesses into smaller units. When Shanghai factories resume operation in various parts of the province, the prosperity of various small towns can be expected soon, and new industrial zones will not be difficult to emerge in the future. Therefore, the provincial government should actively provide strong assistance to the industrial sector in Shanghai.

As for agricultural loans, they can directly save the decline of the rural areas of Jiangsu Province, and further enhance the strength of rural revitalization; at the same time, for Shanghai, after a large amount of idle funds return to the countryside, the phenomenon of speculation and hoarding can be reduced, and the financial and economic sectors can gradually return to normal. If agricultural loans are handled properly, the result can eliminate the social and political crises of both the city and the countryside, so that the Communist Party, which is peering from the sidelines, cannot promote its activities, which is especially beneficial in many ways. However, the success of this undertaking depends on close cooperation between Shanghai and Jiangsu Province.

The relationship between Jiangsu and Shanghai can be seen from the above points. These undertakings have already been started and are awaiting the cooperation and promotion of the authorities of Jiangsu Province and Shanghai. Today, representatives of the Shanghai industrial and commercial sectors, led by Mr. Yuan Ludeng and Mr. Chen Riping as the head and deputy head of the delegation, are organizing a Jiangsu Province visit group to inspect Jiangsu Province and discuss with the provincial authorities, focusing on the above-mentioned matters. We sincerely wish the delegation success, which is also the achievement of the interests of both the province and the city. Local news

### News from Bengbu Scenery

— Gu Ge

Bengbu is a small town on the southern section of the Jinpu Railway on the Huai River. Before the Jinpu Road was built, it was just a small village of a few dozen households. When the railway was built, because its position was exactly at the intersection of north and south, it gradually became prosperous. To this day, there are people who only know Bengbu but don't know that the Fengyang County government was originally located on Bengbu Street!

Bengbu is located in northern Anhui, but it is not far from Jiangnan. Therefore, here you can see mule carts and ox carts full of northern flavor, as well as "Lao Kuai" with slanting clothes and black sweat on their faces, nervously driving livestock; you can also see ships clustered in the Huai River, large freighters, small fishing boats, beautiful fisherwomen, hunched fishermen… Bengbu—no, Fengyang people have the simplicity and boldness of northerners, but also hide the humble character of Jiangnan people. However, in recent years, along with foreign goods, a lot of exaggeration and cunning have also been transported by train.

Bengbu has three strangenesses. What are the three strangenesses? First, there are many men. Because it is the location of the provincial government, with numerous institutions, plus many merchants coming and going, there are especially many single men. You bump into men on the road, and most of them are wearing badges. Therefore, "Three men walking together, there must be my 'official'," is indeed not an exaggeration! Second, there are no teahouses. Teahouses are one of the quintessence of our country, and there is no need to say more. In the places I have been to, whether north or south of the Yangtze River, even small towns and large villages have teahouses dotted around. But in this magnificent location of the Anhui provincial capital, there are none! You can't find one even if you run all over Bengbu! Third, the "rat dragon" style money houses. These emerged after the war, because of the different currency systems in the north and south, and Bengbu became the place to exchange currencies. Northern travelers must get off here and exchange for Central Reserve Bank notes to go south, and southerners must also exchange for Joint Reserve Bank notes here. These money houses are concentrated in the area of Second Road, Guohuo Road, and are called money houses, but they are actually very simple. Just a wire cage of a little over a foot cube, and a fellow countryman with a square face and toe, and you can trade. There are no fewer than dozens of these "cages." Although they seem small, they have a considerable determining effect on Bengbu's finance!

The most lively place in Bengbu is Second Road. There are all kinds of shops, and there are six or seven jewelry stores. Moreover, the road is paved with asphalt—as for the rest of the streets, they are all "original" mud. The mud here is especially sticky. As soon as it rains, the mud mixed with water immediately becomes a thin slurry and floats up. If you step in, at least half a shoe deep is trapped. This mud is sealed on the shoes, and it is strangely hard when it dries. It takes more than half a day to scrape it off.

When the west wind leaves, spring comes to the world. But Bengbu has no spring. In the town, although we feel that the weather is warm, the feeling of spring is—missing. Because the only bit of spring scenery is all locked in the mansions of the rich. Apart from these few "things", it is difficult to find a willow tree letting out green, or half a wild grass or flower, in the whole city. As for the suburbs, apart from the green wheat fields, you can only see an endless expanse of yellow earth, and the really yellow water of the Huai River, which doesn't flow much like still water, the yellow dikes, the yellow villages… In the distance, there may occasionally be one or two barren mountains, but not only can't they be said to be beautiful or majestic, but they also make the surrounding area seem even more desolate. There is also a small Nan Mountain south of the town that is slightly decorative, but calling it a mountain is better than calling it a hill.

But Bengbu's cultural situation is even more desolate. Large bookstores such as Commercial Press, Zhonghua, Kaiming, and Shijie all have branches, mainly selling stationery and textbooks. Only one newspaper, the Anhui Daily, publishes half a sheet a day, and the special feature column mostly reprints Shanghai newspapers. The supplement "Dadi" is extremely small. There is a library, which is considered provincial, but the books are pitifully few, probably less than a thousand.

There is one movie theater, one Beijing opera troupe, and one bang-bang opera troupe for entertainment venues. Xu Xinyuan's troupe had previously performed his "masterpiece" in terms of spoken dramas, and the box office seemed to be okay. Not long ago, they also commemorated the New Games and staged a drama at the Oriental Cinema, Hong Mo's "Guan Di's Visit," directed by Wu Qi, who the newspaper said had ten years of experience in stage drama, and the actors included "established" actors invited from Nanjing and young "officials." The stage conditions, however, were lacking in lighting, scenery, and props. The performance results were naturally difficult to ask for. On the first day, it sold out with soldiers, police, and students, but people began to slip away in the second scene of the first act. Before the play was half over, half of the people had run away. From the opening to the curtain, there was endless applause. The next day, the cast was reorganized and rearranged, and the results were indeed much better. Moreover, no one dared to boo, because the military police ordered that booing was strictly prohibited. So the audience became trembling and did not dare to laugh loudly even when they saw something really funny. This was quite humorous!

As for prostitutes, which are "symbols of culture," of course there are them, and there is also a "prostitute training class." All prostitutes must receive three months of training, and after the expiration of the term, they are recognized as "official" prostitutes.

The prices in Bengbu are roughly the same as in other inland cities, with local products being cheap and foreign goods being expensive. The price of rice is around 40,000, meat is 400 to 500 per catty, and vegetables are more than half cheaper than in Shanghai. Even so, many low-level civil servants with too low fixed salaries pawn their clothes.

Bengbu's law enforcement is particularly clear. There is no black market near the station, the police do not extort on the streets, and there are far fewer cases of corruption than in other places. People from Shanghai feel cool when they come to Bengbu. This is something that Bengbu people can be proud of.

Finally, let's talk about the Huai River, which is prone to tantrums. The river is one mile away from Bengzhen, with two dams blocking it. In these three or four months, standing on the dam and looking out, it is such a quiet piece of yellow water. Occasionally, you can see one or two small boats with full sails, or three or five boatmen vigorously donating cargo ships… But when Hongze Lake is about to flood, no trenches can stop the power of this yellow water. As long as Fengyang people who are a bit older can probably vividly tell about several terrible floods here! …

"Speaking of Fengyang, talking about Fengyang, Fengyang is a good place, but since Emperor Zhu came out, there have been nine years of famine in ten years." This dispatch stops here.

Guangzhou and Hong Kong Bombed for Days

Mainland Base, November 11th, Central News Agency dispatch – The enemy U.S. Air Force's attacks on the mainland have recently intensified in order to open up the Okinawa battle situation. From 12:00 PM to 2:00 PM on the 9th, ten enemy B24 type aircraft and more than ten P38 type aircraft, departing from the Philippine base, attacked the Guangzhou and Hong Kong areas, with airfields as the main target, and dropped bombs.

Governor Ding arrived on time with his entourage and was warmly received by the representatives of the five organizations, including Li Sihao, Wen Guanting, Yuan Ludeng, Lin Kanghou, Pei Lingqing (representing Huang Lianghu), and Chen Binhe.

Guests Attending

Guests attending included Ding Fubao, Ding Fangyuan, Wang Boyuan, Wang Shuxian, Wang Haibo, Wang Binyan, Zhu Shunlin, Shen Siliang, Shen Changgeng, Shen Weiya, Shen Yongruo, He Wuliang, Song Chezai, Cen Zhiliang, Yu Yaoqiu, Di Jiuhua, Shuai Bochun, Wu Yong'an, Wu Huanru, Wu Wenwei, Wu Xiaohou, Zhou Mengbai, Zhou Yuying, Zhou Bangjun, Zhou Fuchen, Yu Guanxian, Jin Xiongbo, Yuan Xifan, Hu Xiongfei, Hu Shouqi, Yu Zijie, Tang Shoumin, Xia Shikui, Xia Yinqing, Weng Yongqing, Sun Choucheng, Xu Jianbing, Xu Xiaochu, Chen Riping, Chen Shao**, Chen Dongbai, Chen** Jun, Chen Fukang, Chen Minshan, Zhang Shiyuan, Zhang Sheng, Zhang Lianfang, Zhang Wanru, Zhang Wenkui, Zhang Deqin, Huang Zhenshi, Xiang Kangyuan, Fu Qiangeng, Dong Fuxiao, Yang Chongbei, Yang Guanchi, Yang Heqing, Wan Xuehang, Zhan Peilin, Zhao Jinqing, Zhao Zhengping, Zhao Mingchuan, Zhao Dexing, Liu Yi, Lu Feng, Pan Bingchen, Bao Guochang, Zheng Jie, Zheng Jianbo, Jiang Xiaoguang, Xie Xiaochu, ** Qingxiang, Gu Gong**, Gu Nanqun, and over five hundred others, gathering together in high spirits.

Tea Party Circumstances

At the beginning of the tea party, the chairmen of the presidium, Mr. Yuan Ludeng and Mr. Li Sihao, successively delivered welcome speeches, followed by a speech from Governor Ding. Then, Huang Sizhai, a representative of the Shaoxing Shanghai Fellow Villagers Association, gave a speech. Finally, everyone enjoyed refreshments. The party concluded at 5:30 PM with great joy. The speeches of each speaker are recorded below:

Yuan Ludeng's Speech

Yuan Ludeng, Chairman of the Presidium, delivered a welcome speech, saying: "Today, our Ningbo and Shaoxing Shanghai Fellow Villagers Associations are participating in this tea party to welcome Governor Ding. We feel particularly excited because Governor Ding is about to take office in Zhejiang, serving as our local official. Although we formally represent only the fellow villagers of Ningbo and Shaoxing, in reality, we represent all the fellow villagers of Zhejiang in our hearts, which makes us feel especially enthusiastic. We have known Governor Ding for a long time. We have often been in contact with him in his previous role as Minister of Social Welfare. We have long admired his talent and meticulousness. Zhejiang's position is extremely important in the current peaceful region, and the public security in the Ningbo-Shaoxing area, as well as the situation that may lead to a mainland war, are even more important. Governor Ding also holds military responsibilities, so his task is naturally even more arduous. We sincerely hope that he will make good use of his meticulous talents to ensure public security and turn danger into safety. As for reforming provincial administration and benefiting the people of Zhejiang, we firmly believe that he will be able to realize the expectations of the people of Zhejiang. We wish him success in his endeavors."

Li Sihao's Speech

Li Sihao, Chairman of the Presidium, delivered a welcome speech, saying: "Today, five organizations are welcoming Governor Ding, and we are honored to participate on behalf of the Shanghai charitable organizations. Governor Ding was the head official in charge of our charitable organizations during his tenure as Minister of Social Welfare. He provided much guidance and assistance to the charitable organizations in Shanghai, and we received many practical benefits. I remember last year, when Madam Ding celebrated her birthday, various parties offered congratulations. Minister Ding used all the congratulatory gifts entirely for charitable purposes, distributing them to various charitable organizations in Beijing and Shanghai. He truly set an example and cared for charitable undertakings. Therefore, now that Governor Ding has been transferred to govern Zhejiang Province, we, from the standpoint of charitable organizations, feel a sense of reluctance to part. We hope that Governor Ding will not consider the distance too great and will provide guidance and continued assistance at any time. At the same time, Shanghai is currently preparing for evacuation, and charitable organizations are especially among the first to be evacuated. If there are suitable places within Zhejiang Province, we hope that Governor Ding will pay special attention to providing assistance. Today, we express our feelings of reluctance to part and gratitude, and at the same time, we express our welcome and expectations. We wish him brightness and health."

Governor Ding's Speech

Governor Ding gave the following speech: "Today, I am very honored and grateful to be welcomed by various Shanghai and Shanghai Fellow Villagers Associations. I am deeply ashamed that Mr. Yuan Ludeng and Mr. Li Sihao have praised my past work, and I feel even more uneasy about the expectations for my future work. Although the environment and duties of my transfer to Zhejiang this time are different from my previous position in the Ministry of Social Welfare, the purpose is the same. My purpose is to serve society with loyalty. Since the beginning of the war in 1939 and the return of the National Government to the capital in 1940, my work has never left the words 'social' and 'welfare.' Whether it was the Central Social Affairs Department, the Social Affairs Department of the Executive Yuan, the Social Movement Command Committee, or the Ministry of Social Welfare, the names of the institutions were different, but the work was still the same: 'serving society' and benefiting the people.

This time, my transfer to Zhejiang has certainly brought about great changes in terms of region and authority, but it can be said that there has been no change in my consistent purpose of 'serving society' and 'benefiting the people.' The only difference is that in the past I was responsible for a partial responsibility in a spatial space, while in the future I will be responsible for the entire responsibility in a local space. No matter what the space is like, and no matter what the parts are like, it is the duty of the government to serve society and benefit the people. During my time at the Ministry of Social Welfare in the past, because the Ministry of Social Welfare was a newly established administrative agency in China, everything had to be built from scratch. Fortunately, with the cooperation of all sectors, a considerable foundation has been laid, especially with the great cooperation of leaders from all walks of life in Shanghai. Although I have now left the Ministry of Social Welfare, I will always express my gratitude for the efforts of all sectors in Shanghai. This time I was transferred to Zhejiang. Zhejiang is very close to Shanghai, and there are many fellow villagers from Zhejiang in Shanghai, so there are many connections in politics, economy, and culture. I hope that the leaders from all walks of life in Shanghai and the fellow villagers from Zhejiang will continue to assist and urge me in the same way as before. The late Chairman Wang instructed the people of the country on New Year's Day last year to make the minimum effort to establish public security and stabilize people's livelihood.

Since the establishment of the Zhejiang provincial government, it has been more than five years. Through the efforts of Governors Fu and Xiang, it has reached the point of establishing public security and stabilizing people's livelihood. This time I am going to Zhejiang, I pray to ensure public security and improve people's livelihood. Under these two major principles, I will implement my long-standing purpose of serving society and benefiting the military of the people. However, in order to ensure public security, we must first improve people's livelihood. If people's livelihood cannot be improved, then public security cannot be ensured. In order to improve people's livelihood, we must start with increasing production and circulating production materials. To increase production and circulate materials, we need the cooperation of the economic circles in Shanghai. Zhejiang fellow villagers in Shanghai have always occupied a strong position in the economic circles in Shanghai, so I hope that all Zhejiang fellow villagers in Shanghai will return a part of their strength to Zhejiang for the sake of loving their hometown.

Regarding my leadership in Zhejiang, I can tell you two things: First, in terms of personnel, we will absolutely adhere to the principle of recruiting Zhejiang fellow villagers. Second, we will pay attention to the communication between public opinion and the government in the future. We also plan to establish an advisory committee, similar to the Shanghai method, to communicate the opinions of officials and the public, and to express the openness of provincial administration. If any of you fellow villagers have suitable candidates, please recommend them for the benefit of the people."

Huang Yuqi's Speech

Briefly stated: "Today, I am honored to participate as a representative of the Shanghai Fellow Villagers Association, and the fellow villagers of the seven counties of Shaoxing also feel deeply honored. Under the expectations of the two chairmen, Yuan Ludeng and Li Sihao, and after listening to Governor Ding's instructions, I have a deeper understanding. Governor Ding's leadership of Zhejiang this time places a heavy responsibility on the fellow villagers of Ningbo, Shaoxing, and the entire province of Zhejiang. We should sincerely cooperate. We are even more grateful for Governor Ding's instructions to govern Zhejiang Province with Zhejiang people. In the past, Governor Chuan was concerned about the suffering of the people and specially convened a meeting with fellow villagers in Shanghai to fulfill the expectations of our fellow villagers. This time, Governor Ding is in charge of overall planning, and his spirit will surely lead to bright results. We also hope that Governor Ding will treat the people like his own children after taking office, do his best to protect them, and pacify the local area. Finally, I wish Governor Ding good health in his administration."

Chairman's Instructions

The speech of Acting Chairman Chen of the National Government and concurrently Chairman of the Military Affairs Commission, briefly stated: "Distinguished guests, officials, and students, today I have come to Shanghai from Beijing to attend the graduation ceremony of the fourth class of students from the Central Naval Academy. I am very gratified. Today, the most important thing for all of you students graduating is to understand the government's policies. In other words, we must follow the national policy, taking the Three Principles of the People and Pan-Asianism as the starting point, striving for national freedom through peace, seeking domestic unity through anti-communism, and then striving for national independence through nation-building. Now that the situation is becoming increasingly tense, the meaning of the government's participation in the Greater East Asia War is the initial purpose of the establishment of the National Government, and it is also the purpose of the National Government's first establishment in Guangzhou, which is to abolish unequal treaties, strive for equal independence and the freedom and liberation of the entire nation, and unite with the nations of the world that treat us equally to fight together. This is the highest purpose of the National Government's participation in the war, regardless of success or failure. Now the National Government is demanding freedom, independence, and unity. This point should be paid special attention to and must be thoroughly understood. Although it is not easy for our navy to seek satisfaction in terms of material resources, the army, navy, and air force all have their common conditions, and the government has a unified plan. I hope that after graduation, you will work hard to study, prepare the latest knowledge, and revitalize the Chinese Navy. No matter how lacking the material conditions are, and no matter how urgent the situation is, we should strengthen our efforts in the navy and expand our navy. This is my expectation for the future of our navy and the construction of you yourselves."

Key Points of Director Zhou's Instructions

The key points of Director Zhou's instructions are as follows: In the past, the focus was on rectification work, which can also be said to be passive work, which is to earnestly eliminate the bad habits of police officers who harass citizens.

### Jiangsu Province Plans to Build the Su-Hu Highway

The Su-Hu Highway is formed by connecting the Su-Kun Road and the Kun-Hu Road, which is an important transportation line between Jiangsu Province and Shanghai. Since the incident, all the bridges and road surfaces have been severely damaged. Considering that highway transportation is becoming increasingly important, Sun Yucai, Director of the Jiangsu Provincial Construction Bureau and concurrently Director of the Construction General Engineering Office, and Deputy Director Xu Ying, following the instructions of Governor Ren, sent personnel last month to conduct a detailed survey and plan for construction. The road within Jiangsu Province is 57 kilometers long, 7.5 meters wide, and the original coal layer road surface is 5.5 meters wide. There are 76 bridges (including the Gu Pu Bridge at the provincial and municipal boundary). Except for 24 bridges that have been filled, there are 6 semi-permanent bridge wedges and 46 temporary wooden bridges. The repair plan prepared by the office is as follows: Bridge Engineering: The width of all original bridges with a width of less than 4 meters will be changed to 4 meters to facilitate traffic. The load-bearing capacity of all bridges under 6 tons will be corrected to allow 6-ton vehicles to pass. Bridges that have been damaged and do not interfere with waterway traffic and farmland irrigation will be filled to save repair costs. Road Surface Engineering: The principle of using local materials will be adopted. Heavily damaged parts will be made of crushed stone or crushed brick foundation to make it solid and flat. A 4.5-meter wide and 2.5-centimeter thick macadam road surface will be paved, and the road arch will be corrected. The engineering cost for the entire bridge wedge road surface is estimated to be approximately 200,000 yuan. The entire plan has been submitted to the Governor by the office and approved, and preparations are now being actively made for construction. The office will divide the entire project into two sections for road surface and bridges, publish advertisements in various Shanghai and Jiangsu newspapers for business bidding, and schedule the opening of bids in the office's auditorium on the 15th of this month to start construction as soon as possible.

### Report from Xu, Director of the Construction Bureau: Recent Developments in Various Construction Projects, Answering Questions at the Press Conference

The press conference, hosted by the Municipal Publicity Department, was held at 10:30 AM yesterday (the 11th) in the Municipal Government Conference Hall. Director Xu Ji-dun of the Construction Bureau was invited to report on the recent progress of various construction projects in the city. Director Xu explained in detail the recent policy implementations, road construction, and other issues. Finally, he also shared his impressions of the recent inspection of various affiliated agencies of the Bureau. Details are recorded as follows:

Recent Policy Implementations

What is the general situation of the Construction Bureau's recent policy implementations? (Answer) It can be divided into the following points: First, after the merger of the Municipal Public Works Bureau and the Municipal Engineering Bureau into the Construction Bureau, the departments of the two bureaus were managed separately. The affiliated agencies of the two bureaus were also gradually adjusted, merged regionally, and then divided into groups. This is a pilot program. Second, after the merger, the Public Works Bureau and the Engineering Bureau had a total of 3,000 workers. In the past, due to disorganization, they were gradually laid off. So far, it has been reduced to 2,000 workers, all of whom are given proper management to maximize work efficiency. Third, in the past, the warehouses were full of materials. However, since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the source of raw materials has become difficult, and procurement is difficult, resulting in the gradual depletion of stockpiled materials. Recently, the Bureau plans to purchase additional supplies. Fourth, due to the shortage of materials, it is difficult to accommodate the difficulties of applicants for vehicle inspections. The inspection standards are relatively low. However, various vehicles that endanger public safety, obstruct traffic, and pose a risk of accidents are strictly prohibited from driving. Fifth, the re-adjustment of car license plates is underway to show uniformity. It is being actively organized, and in the future, a "沪" (Hu, short for Shanghai) character will be added to each car license plate for identification. Sixth, in the past, the order at the docks was extremely chaotic. Unemployed hooligans occupied the area and took the opportunity to extort money, harming travelers. Ultimately, there were too many management agencies, causing numerous obstacles in management. In order to achieve unified command, the Bureau plans to establish a dock management committee composed of relevant agencies to improve the situation. Various regulations are currently being drafted. Seventh, actively carry out various statistical tasks to make them easier to understand.

Road Construction

Can you tell us about the progress of road construction projects? (Answer) Regarding road construction, it is the most important aspect of the Bureau's recent policy implementations. The current road construction project is about to begin. The main project is the construction of the Su-Hu (Suzhou-Shanghai) Highway. The city is responsible for the section from Shanghai to Gu Pu Bridge, which is about 26 kilometers. The section west of the bridge is the responsibility of Jiangsu Province. The project is divided into three sections, with one section chief for each section, working within the specified boundaries. The surveying and demarcation are currently underway. The load standard for this section of the road is 10 metric tons. The road will eventually connect to Nanjing. At the same time, the construction of the Hu-Hang (Shanghai-Hangzhou) Highway is also being planned. The first section to be constructed is the Shanghai-Songjiang section. Zhejiang Province is also sending personnel to inspect the plan. In addition, the North Xizang Road to North Railway Station Road surface is also being planned. Road construction within the urban area will begin soon.

The procedures for applying for construction projects and other licenses seem to be slow. How does your bureau plan to improve this? (Answer) Due to the communication with various bureaus and the complexity of sending personnel to inspect and investigate, the issuance of licenses takes up to a week. We absolutely do not intentionally make things difficult. If any of our staff members are intentionally delaying or extorting, please report it at any time for thorough investigation.

Recent Situation of the Two Roads

What is the operating status of the Shangchuan and Shangnan Roads, and the city ferry? (Answer) First, regarding the operating status of the Shangchuan and Shangnan Roads, it has been quite good recently. In the past, the municipal government adopted the principle of self-sufficiency for the two roads to maintain expenses. Recently, not only can they be self-sufficient, but they also have a monthly surplus that is turned over to the municipal treasury, amounting to more than 10 million yuan. The rails, sleepers, and passenger seats of the two roads have been repaired and replaced. Regardless of military police, government personnel, or heavy vehicles, all are required to purchase tickets. The total monthly revenue of the two roads is about 50 to 60 million yuan. Second, the operating status of the city ferry was good in the first half of last year, with a surplus of more than 300,000 yuan. However, in the second half of last year, due to fuel, ship routes, increased employee salaries, and huge expenses, the surplus in the first half of the year was lost, with a deficit of more than 100,000 yuan. However, the business for the past year has improved again, which can make up for this loss and even have some surplus.

Impressions of the Inspection

What are your impressions of having inspected various affiliated agencies? (Answer) Due to time constraints, I only inspected two-thirds of them this time. The motivation for this trip was to inspect warehouse materials and to see if there were any corrupt practices in vehicle registration. The results of this trip, in general, show that the following points should be improved: First, actively strengthen personnel management, select talents carefully, and assign specialized technical personnel separately. Second, plan for material replenishment and repair damaged factory buildings.

### Finance Bureau Prepares to Establish Business Tax Assessment Committee, Candidate Committee Members Are Being Nominated Separately

The Municipal Finance Bureau levies business tax in the city based on two standards: the total business income and the business capital of each industry. Now, the Bureau believes that many businesses are reporting inaccurate capital amounts. To avoid disputes, it has decided to actively prepare for the establishment of a Business Tax Assessment Committee in accordance with Article 9 of the Bureau's Business Tax Regulations: "If the business tax collection agency believes that the declared total business income or business capital is inaccurate, it may establish a Business Tax Assessment Committee to assess it when necessary." It is understood that the quota of the committee has been set at five people. In addition to three of them being appointed by the Bureau, the remaining two have been decided to be appointed by the Municipal Advisory Committee and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, each nominating one person to participate. The Bureau has sent letters to the above two agencies to determine the candidate committee members as soon as possible and to reply with the names of the representatives. It is reported that the Bureau is drafting the organization and assessment rules of the assessment committee.

### General Anami, Minister of the Army of Japan

— Kintzaburo Takagaki

"Morality and righteousness are the strength of war." This is General Anami's consistent argument.

In the outline of the operation's code of conduct, "Consistent cooperation is the most important thing to achieve combat goals..." This certainly emphasizes the importance of cooperative operations, but the morality and sense of righteousness of each corps and army, especially in large-scale corps and army operations, are the most important.

At the beginning of the Greater East Asia War, the general was ordered to cooperate with Lieutenant General Sakai's South China Army on a certain front to attack Hong Kong. At this time, although our Japanese army was constantly advancing towards Hong Kong, because the Chongqing army attempted to disrupt the rear of the Japanese army, it was necessary to contain the Chongqing army's attempt. However, various conditions at that time made it very difficult to carry out this cooperative operation. Nevertheless, the general disregarded the great sacrifices of the army and, from the standpoint of morality and righteousness, overcame all difficulties for the friendly army and provided assistance. Behind the famous Battle of Hong Kong, there is actually such a beautiful story. This proves that it completed a very important task.

In addition, in the North China Front and the South Pacific Front, the traces of the general's use of troops always depict the rough lines of the above-mentioned arguments.

This creed is not the general's tactical thought, but also the main trunk of his outlook on life and ethics. The general's high prestige may be due to the influence of the martyr Tachibana Chūsa in his childhood school days, but he always treats people with morality and righteousness. This may be naturally produced from the fundamental attitude of daily life.

In swordsmanship, he is a hero of five or six dan. In addition, he is particularly good at archery and pistol shooting. The general's creed in this regard is the principle of sword swings without hesitation and bullets without fail. In training soldiers, he also advocates not to seek many goals, but to make sure that when the sword swings, an opponent will fall down, and when a bullet is fired, an opponent's chest will bleed. This is the best policy.

Don't fight small battles, it is best to use the Mount Tai pressing-down style to hit the face. This style is also reflected in his work. No matter what problems he encounters, he first makes a light and heavy judgment, and then bravely moves forward according to his own consideration.

There are all kinds of people around the general, who is entrusted with great expectations, expressing their opinions. But one day, a general was worried about the decline of the world and told the general with great sadness. At this time, the general tapped the table lightly and clearly, saying:

"Zhou Taigong said, 'Don't cry!'"

It is said that the general's short sentence that came out of his mouth naturally made the general completely enlightened, which proves that General Anami has an extraordinary capacity.

In the current situation, the cruel traces of the enemy's American bombing can certainly show the style of the martyrs who died heroically, but the general said to someone:

"People often praise the beauty of cherry blossoms when they fall, which symbolizes warriors, but this is not entirely true. The true beauty of cherry blossoms is not in one petal, but as Fujita Tōko said, 'When it blooms, it becomes ten thousand cherry blossoms...' Motoori Norinaga said in the phrase 'The morning light fills the mountains with cherry blossoms,' it is in the full bloom of mountains and valleys. This is the great act of iron-like unity of the Yamato nation at the critical moment of the rise and fall of the imperial country, which is nothing but the expression of the Yamato heart."

In the great battle on the Japanese mainland that will take place in the near future, this is a great gamble war with the eternal fate of the Yamato nation as a stake. In order to win this great national war, the military and the civilian population must not allow any opposition to occur. The center of the war is the real overall strength, which is harmony, that is, the mutual trust of 100 million people.

We have infinite expectations for the new Army Minister Anami, who is full of sincerity and courage. (Translated from the Asahi Shimbun on the 13th)

### Japanese Sea and Air Special Attack Forces, the Natural Enemy of the Enemy's American Quantity Tactics

Completely Overturning Quantity Tactics

In the past, the strength of fleet aviation was always inferior to that of base air power, but today the enemy Americans have broken this old concept with quantity. They boast that the amount of quantity determines everything in this war. Just as the momentum tactic was almost regarded as an immutable golden rule in modern warfare, the Japanese Special Attack Forces suddenly appeared, completely overturning this concept. We must know that the attack method of the Special Attack Forces is not compiled as a tactic. The special attack method established by the Japanese Army and Navy Air Force in the Philippines has an important nature that can determine the rise and fall of the country in the Battle of Okinawa.

The key to the Battle of Okinawa is how long the Japanese special attack attacks can continue to strike the enemy's quantity. The enemy Americans tasted the taste of the Japanese special attack attack in the Philippines front. Due to the suicide attacks of the Japanese Navy Kamikaze Special Attack Force and the Army Fugaku Mandala Special Attack Force and other special attack forces, the concept of quantity tactics that the enemy Americans have absolutely believed in has also been shaken, which is undeniable. The enemy Americans almost dispatched all their forces in the Battle of Okinawa, which obviously included the Japanese special attack attack in the budget. This time, they dispatched 1,100 ships and almost used all the power of the Pacific Fleet. They believe that with such a huge quantity, even the special attack attack cannot help it. The Japanese army, on the other hand, held the belief that they would surely die, regardless of the amount, they would destroy it. Therefore, the core of the Battle of Okinawa can be said to be the duel between the American material belief and the Japanese special attack belief. These two opposing beliefs are the essence of this air and naval decisive battle in Okinawa.

Preparation Attacks Futile

To prevent the Japanese special attack force's planes from launching, the enemy Americans specially dispatched their mobile units to attack the Japanese Kyushu air base group on March 18th and 19th before landing on Okinawa. On that day, the cumulative number of carrier-based aircraft dispatched reached 1,500. On the 27th and 28th, about 500 carrier-based battleships flew again from Kyushu to the south. During this period, B29s flying from the Mariana Islands base continuously raided on the 27th, with a cumulative total of more than 200 aircraft day and night. In addition to attacking the Tachiarai airfield, they also laid mines in the Seto Inland Sea to obstruct the Japanese warships from launching. By the 31st, hundreds of B29s attacked the Tachiarai and Omura airfields again. After more than ten days of fierce air raids, the enemy Americans thought that the Japanese air power was on the verge of collapse, so they began to invade the Okinawa Islands on April 1st. However, the enemy's American preparation attack was futile. Regarding this point, it can be understood from the fact that after the enemy Americans landed, the Japanese Air Force launched dozens or even hundreds of special attack forces to attack fiercely every day, and the Japanese aquatic special attack ships broke through their mines and then launched majestically.

In the midst of the fierce battle between the enemy's mobile units and the Japanese special attack flying teams, the air decisive battle over Okinawa entered the second stage of the decisive battle. The fierce attack by the Japanese air special attack force that began on the 6th finally forced the enemy Americans to frankly admit that they had "experienced the biggest air raid in the Pacific War," and issued a "If this continues for two weeks, our Okinawa operation may become a lost move" cry of grief. The activities of the Japanese special attack flying team did not stop even on the three days of April 8th, 9th and 10th when the weather was bad. On the 11th, when the weather improved, it launched a total assault again. During this period, the water special attack team, which had been preparing for a long time, also continued to launch from Okinawa Island, causing the enemy Americans to issue a "Strictly prevent Japanese suicide boats" warning signal.

Base Power Undiminished

Due to the fierce attacks by the Japanese sea and air forces, and the fierce battles of the ground troops, the enemy's losses increased day by day, and they became anxious and restless. Therefore, on April 8th, they dispatched carrier-based aircraft to fly to Kagoshima to indiscriminately bomb the special attack base and the city street area. However, the power of the Japanese air base group was not diminished at all, and the special attack team's attacks became even more violent.

On the 16th, the remaining aircraft carrier group, which had not shown its attitude in the nearby sea until now, suddenly appeared and launched another attack on the Japanese air base. This was obviously an adventurous move by the enemy in order to avoid being attacked by more severe special attack teams and to achieve a more thorough collapse. The enemy aircraft carrier group that appeared on that day was divided into three groups, containing six aircraft carriers, which can be regarded as the entire strength of its remaining mobile units. Why did the enemy Americans dispatch their precious troops? From the afternoon of this day, an aviation team composed of various fighter-bombers, such as P51, P40, B25, and B24, flew from the Okinawa base and fiercely attacked the Japanese air base. What was this for? Isn't this a sign that the Japanese special attack attack for two consecutive weeks has been victorious?

The enemy Americans were so anxious that they launched this attack, risking their remaining mobile units in a desperate attempt to destroy the enemy. The opportunity to destroy the enemy, which the enemy had created themselves, was excellent! The anxiety and restlessness of the enemy Americans is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for Japan to destroy the enemy. Today, from Okinawa to the South Kyushu Sea, the Japanese and American sides are using all their means to fight hard. (Translated from the Asahi Shimbun on April 18th)

### Aerial Decisive Battle over Okinawa Island

Since the start of the Okinawa operation, the enemy fleet and mobile force surrounding Okinawa Island have suffered tremendous damage daily due to the fierce attacks of the Japanese air and naval forces. Disregarding sacrifices, the American forces desperately resupply their landed troops. Simultaneously, hundreds of carrier-based planes are constantly deployed in lines between the Japanese mainland and Okinawa Island, attempting to block attacks by the Japanese air forces. However, the Japanese air forces, primarily consisting of Kamikaze special attack units, along with naval and land units, continued their extremely fierce attacks after the weather improved on April 11th. They constantly engaged the enemy fleet and land forces around Okinawa, inflicting significant damage. Currently, the situation surrounding Okinawa has reached its climax in the sea, on land, and in the air.

From the 12th onwards, the elite Japanese fighter squadrons moved south along the Ryukyu Islands chain, broke through the enemy carrier-based aircraft defense lines, and launched a magnificent aerial decisive battle. In the meantime, due to continuous attacks by special attack units, the assaults on enemy ships and mobile forces intensified. The publicly announced results from the 12th to the 15th inclusive, reported the sinking of thirteen enemy vessels of unspecified type, one of which was a large vessel, most likely an aircraft carrier.

The significant characteristic of this aerial decisive battle is that all Japanese aircraft dispatched were special attack aircraft. They carried out attacks with the resolve to completely expend all aircraft, striving to deliver a fatal blow to the enemy. (Translated from the April 18th Asahi Shimbun)

### Recent Situation in Southern Okinawa Island

Regarding the Okinawa battle, the enemy has been focusing their attacks on the southern part of the island, such as Naha, Itoman, Minato, Nakama, Maeda, Kadena, and the two northern and central airfields, despite having secured landing points on Ie Island, the Kerama Islands, Tsushima, and other islands around Okinawa Island. Fierce battles have been raging in this area in recent days. According to the Japanese announcement on the 10th of this month, the enemy forces in southern Okinawa began a fierce offensive on the 8th of this month simultaneously at Nakama, Maeda, and Makiminato, north of Shuri. Thanks to the Japanese army's advantageous terrain, coupled with the cooperation of air attack units, the enemy forces continued to suffer significant defeats. Therefore, the enemy's attempt to completely occupy Okinawa has ultimately become a dream.

### Rescuing the Urgent vs. Rescuing the Poor

— Zhou Bangjun

As the saying goes: "Rescue the urgent, not the poor." Saving the urgent is limited to a specific time, while saving the poor is an endless task. Those who need "urgent" help may require assistance due to the inability to actively manage funds or may need to borrow money due to unforeseen circumstances; rescuing the poor is different, the uses are undefined, there is no continuous source of support, and begging has no end. Therefore, saving the urgent is mostly active assistance, while saving the poor is mostly passive giving.

Looking at Shanghai today, the number of impoverished masses is increasing daily, and the soaring prices of daily necessities and manufacturer layoffs are the causes. Therefore, relief cannot be achieved solely through material and economic support. The focus should be on preventing and prohibiting layoffs, which is the main countermeasure to eliminate and prevent the increase in the number of impoverished masses. In reality, with the lack of materials and power restrictions, even with great effort, it is impossible to stabilize prices. Manufacturers, facing huge expenses and heavy taxes, cannot maintain operations without layoffs. Therefore, the solution lies first in opening up the sources of materials to ensure supply, prevent price increases, and lower prices. Secondly, taxes should be adjusted to reduce the burden on manufacturers. If these steps are taken, the number of impoverished masses may not increase further.

In short, rescuing the poor is more important than rescuing the urgent. During this period, measures are difficult. Even with sufficient financial resources, material resources may still be insufficient. Therefore, to ensure social order and the welfare of the public, we can work together on the following points to effectively address both the root and branch causes of urgent and poverty relief:

1. Unification of Administrative Agencies: Recently, there has been a proliferation of agencies, whose nature is inevitably similar, but the management methods are different, the regulations are different, difficult to comply with, and difficult to deal with, which makes manufacturers annoyed. Therefore, they cease operation, resulting in the increase of the impoverished masses. In order to alleviate the difficulties of manufacturers, the administrative agencies must be unified urgently, if fewer manufactures cease operation, the unemployed impoverished masses would not increase so much.

2. Eliminate the Obstacles to Material Transport: Due to the scarcity of materials, blood forms the high prices. At present, there is no way to suppress it except to encourage imports and eliminate the harm of imports. Therefore, the materials imported to Shanghai should be facilitated as much as possible. Public officials' obstruction and extortion should be strictly prohibited, and the numerous checkpoints on waterways should be immediately eliminated. Without this plan, there will be layer upon layer of exploitation, making transportation a fearful task, and the source of supplies will inevitably be exhausted. How can we reduce the price?

3. Establish Factories for Daily Necessities: Raise funds, use public buildings in the suburbs, accommodate the poor, investigate available materials, and establish various handicraft factories, so that everyone has the opportunity to support themselves.

4. Strengthen Vocational Introduction Agencies: All industrial and commercial enterprises, both existing and new, that organize vocational introduction agencies should establish close contact. All job seekers should first register, and in addition to their intelligence and skills, also collect information about their family situation and send people to investigate their past performance and personality. Then assign based on ability, or provide appropriate guidance, so that people can make the best of their talents and make the best use of their talents.

The above may not be a perfect cure-all, but if we can prevent or reduce the number of impoverished people, we can increase the wealth of the country. Therefore, rescuing the urgent and rescuing the poor is a fundamental plan to preserve the nation's vitality.

### Overview of the Third District of the Naval Baojia in Pudong

— Pan Guangzhen

The Pudong Naval Baojia has been preparing since March and was officially established on April 1. In terms of operations, it sometimes follows the path of the Pudong South District Public Office Baojia and the police station Baojia. Therefore, the naval Baojia's promotion of various tasks is relatively smooth. The preliminary work in the third district has now reached a stage, and a brief report on the general situation is as follows:

District Boundaries: The Pudong Naval Baojia currently has three districts: 1, 2, and 3. The third district has the smallest area and the fewest people. It stretches from Yangjing Port in the east to Minsheng Road Laoyakou in the west, Huaiqianda Port in the south, and the Huangpu River in the north (shaped like a boot foot), covering an area of about 6,000 mu, with a total of 20 Bao, 198 Jia, 2,634 households, and 13,021 people.

Baojia Personnel: The district office is located at 122 Fangbang Road, Yangjing Town, with three clerks, all of whom are employed. Each Bao has one Bao chief, for a total of 20 people. Each Jia has one Jia chief, for a total of 198 people. The Bao and Jia chiefs are all unpaid positions.

Household Registration Compilation: The household registration in the third district has now been completed. For this work, we have benefited greatly from the efforts and experience of the Bao and Jia chiefs.

Reorganization of the Self-Defense Corps: The town-run self-defense corps has been temporarily suspended due to the transition period. The district has now taken over part of it, including 11 watchtowers, 7 whistles, 11 ropes, 20 cotton coats, and 8 raincoats. After repairs and replenishment, they can be used. The number of self-defense corps members is being selected according to regulations, and a comprehensive plan will be fairly put into action soon.

Air Defense Equipment: The town originally had very complete air defense equipment, but since the person in charge left his post without permission, and no one was responsible, everything has collapsed. The district should take over the part, but it is unwilling to hand it over. If the district were to set it up on its own, it would be redundant and a burden on the people. Moreover, the district has wasted resources, which is not in line with the people's feelings of saving. The district's most important air defense affairs have been delayed due to personnel matters and have not yet been realized.

Organizing the Youth Corps: The town originally had a Youth Corps, with one squadron and three detachments. The detachment addresses are all outside the jurisdiction of the third district, and the members' addresses are also outside the jurisdiction. Therefore, it cannot be used, and it is necessary to reorganize it. As soon as the regulations are issued, enthusiastic young people will be selected to take on this work.

Collecting Baojia Fees: The Baojia fees in this district have been collected, and the deadline for the March and April payments is the end of April. The Baojia fees are divided into several types: 100 yuan, 200 yuan, 400 yuan, 600 yuan, 800 yuan, and 1,000 yuan. This district is a poor rural area, so except for shops, the average monthly fee per household is 100 yuan. Those who are truly poor and unable to produce, can apply for exemption after obtaining proof from the Bao chief.

Establishing a Cooperative: The Naval Baojia authorities, in order to ensure the stable lives of Baojia personnel and increase work efficiency, have organized a Naval Baojia Personnel Cooperative. In the near future, a ration system will be implemented. Bao chiefs in this district who join the cooperative will soon be able to enjoy this right.

Conclusion: The preliminary work in the third district may not have achieved the ideal results, but some progress has been made. I am in charge of the district chief's position, and I feel that my ability is limited. If we are to promote the second step of work, we still need to rely on the continued efforts of all Baojia personnel and the continued cooperation of local agencies and gentry.

### A Small Suggestion

— Gonggan

The evacuation movement has been going on for more than two months, but there has been no great effect so far, and inconvenient transportation is naturally the main reason. It is still difficult to move people in, let alone move families. Think about how many wooden boxes, suitcases and sundries a family has, big and small? If you want to move all of them, the freight will probably be greater than the value of the things themselves, or simply cannot be transported. If you throw them all away, you can't bear to. If you sell them to second hand merchants, the price will be terribly devalued and you will get little in return. As a result, people are still hesitant and slow to act because they "can't bear to part with them and can't run away." To remedy this defect, in addition to smoothing transportation as much as possible, I think there are three solutions:

Establish a Moving and Transportation Department: The government should contact Yonglu Transportation agencies to provide low-cost transportation services specifically for those returning to their hometowns to transport furniture and sundries. At the same time, it should try to maintain safe navigation and avoid all kinds of unnecessary losses.

Establish a Furniture Purchasing Office for Returning Citizens: Purchase the furniture of those returning to their hometowns at fair prices to facilitate evacuation; and then sell it on to others.

Establish a Return Assistance Fund: Use government or social forces to raise funds to subsidize those who cannot afford to return to their hometowns and those who cannot afford to transport their furniture back to their hometowns.

Of the three solutions above, the second is the most practical. The establishment of the institution can be divided into three parts:

Receiving Department—Set up receiving departments in various districts and invite clerks from various businesses in the city to act as voluntary appraisers. Those returning to their hometowns who are willing to sell their furniture can apply to the department to purchase it; after receiving the application, the department investigates to make sure that the applicant is indeed returning to their hometown, and can send appraisers to appraise and purchase it on their behalf. The principle of pricing is not to let the citizens suffer too much loss.

Auction Department—Simultaneously set up an auction department in each district to be responsible for selling. Auction the goods received to the public; charge a small commission as an expense.

Transportation Department—Items purchased that cannot be sold locally; can be transported to nearby rural areas for public sale; at the same time, it can also make up for the current shortage of supplies in the countryside.

As for the initial capital for purchases, the municipal government can apply for credit loans from money shops and banks. Although the program is too idealistic, if it can be implemented, the evacuation movement can proceed smoothly.

### Teacher's Tram Fare

In the decisive stage of the war, the lives of ordinary salaried people are under serious pressure, especially primary school teachers, and I am one of them. I suffer from pain and cannot express it in words. Since Mr. Dai Yingfu has served as the director of the Municipal Education Bureau, he has worked hard to improve the salaries of municipal primary school teachers, increasing them to around 20,000 yuan, and providing them with three pecks of rice per month in accordance with the treatment of civil servants. Although life cannot be fully maintained, being able to enjoy such treatment is already very good during this wartime, and we are very grateful for the care and concern of the education authorities.

However, since May 1, tram fares have increased. The daily fare is 1,000 yuan for those who need more trips or at least 300 yuan for those who need fewer trips. As for me, I need 900 yuan every day. If I buy a monthly pass for 24,000 yuan, it would be 12,000 yuan if it were calculated at half price for civil servants (primary school teacher's salary is between 15,000 and 20,000 yuan per month). I hope that the municipal government (not only the Education Bureau, but also the civil servants of other bureaus) can find a better solution. It would be best for civil servants to ride the tram completely free of charge, following the example of the current personnel of the Inspection Bureau; otherwise, they should be allowed to purchase military tickets for 15 yuan each to reduce the burden. (A teacher)

### Civil Servants' Treatment Issues

— Yao Gengxuan

Since Vice President Zhou took over as mayor of Shanghai, he has greatly reorganized the city's various administrative agencies and has also made corresponding adjustments to the treatment of civil servants, especially the administrative personnel in police and finance, who are treated better than average. Past cases of embezzlement, extortion, and door-to-door solicitation have largely ceased, and it can be said that considerable progress has been made.

According to the information announced in the newspapers after the adjustment, each person receives at least 18,000 yuan in salary in addition to the three pecks of rice distributed free of charge (police officers receive from two and a half to six pecks), which was enough to get by at the time. However, the general price level has now increased by about four or five times compared with that time, but the treatment of civil servants has not been correspondingly adjusted due to financial reasons. This is an issue worthy of attention.

According to my friends, only the staff of the municipal government itself and the Finance Bureau are living relatively stable lives. For the majority of the staff in other agencies, apart from senior and middle-level staff, it is difficult to maintain the minimum living standard for a family with their salaries, so it is no wonder that there are many complaints.

These grassroots civil servants are the part of the administrative agency that is closest to the public, and whether their lives are stable or not directly affects the work they do. If they do not work hard, then even with the leadership and guidance of excellent senior officials, they will be powerless. Therefore, in my opinion, I hope that the authorities will make a statistical report on the civil servants' cost of living index every month so that the salaries of most staff can maintain a reasonable ratio with the price level, so that their lives have sufficient protection, so that the past bad phenomenon does not reappear.

### The Way Out

— Yi Fan

On the small table in front of me lies a silver-red invitation card.

I no longer feel surprised in my heart. Shouldn't this be a very ordinary thing? If I could find the time to have a glass of wedding wine, wouldn't that be pleasant? Yet, it always feels as if a rope is binding my heart, making me feel a restrained disturbance. I haven't understood where this disturbance comes from, nor do I have a reason to explain it. I cannot admit that this has a hint of selfishness. I only sincerely grieve for her deceiving herself with empty words, regardless of whether she believes this is happiness. This is a common thing in life, yet in this ordinariness, I see an internal change in her. How much time can change those with wavering wills! Why did she have to change? Weren't we walking together before? And from her words and actions, I once glimpsed that bold, forward-looking spirit. How can I believe that she would turn around? But she has indeed changed, changed so quickly, that she didn't even give me time to know! I closed my eyes, as if walking on a withered road, suddenly I could no longer hear that loud call, and when I looked back, I had lost that agile figure in the desolate wilderness. Alas, I have lost another companion, and I feel an unbearable loneliness.

People say that marriage is a woman's ultimate destination. Although I don't believe this, I do think that a woman doesn't necessarily have to say goodbye to her career after marriage. Perhaps I shouldn't be disturbed by this invitation card. I should force out a calm smile to bless her, wishing her a happy marriage. But I feel that the surrounding air is solemn, so quiet that it stifles all sounds, not allowing me to laugh. I looked up at the window. Outside the window, it was a beautiful, sunny day. Bright sunlight shone on my table. My eyes fell, and I caught another glimpse of the invitation card, which appeared even more vibrant in the sunlight. Ah, isn't this a familiar scene? I wanted to recall this familiar scene in my memory. Only then did I remember that just less than a year ago, I was also sitting by this window, with bright sunlight shining in. I eagerly unfolded her letter. The clean, white stationery shimmered in the sunlight, as vividly as today's invitation card. I read word by word:

"...I received your letter, and I know that you still care about me so much, but you are too excessively praising me. In fact, how could I have the hope and potential that you say I have? I remember when we were young, we were playful and loving, without any barriers. But now I can't help but suspect that you have unconsciously picked up the perfunctory habits of adults who have adapted to society. Because from your words, I see that you lack genuine sympathy for me, and perhaps even harbor some envy. Oh, why don't you still treat me with the attitude you had when we were young? You should directly point out my mistakes, state your frank opinions, and understand my situation more deeply, offering sympathy and comfort. Think about it, I am someone who has never received affection since childhood, and has been trapped in my family, living a bleak life. Now I have finally managed to enter the senior normal school, but it is really just for the sake of making a living in the future. How can I talk about having a promising future? Of course, I have had a special love for teaching since I was a child, and I really hope that I can make some achievements in the education field in the future, but due to limited financial ability, I can no longer pursue further studies, so that enthusiasm has cooled down by half. I want to confide in others, but I think only you are my childhood confidant, and you will definitely understand me, but who knew it would be like this again, it really makes me feel sad! You say that I am about to graduate, which should be a cause for joy, but I am worried about graduating. Originally, I was deeply afraid that I would not be able to take on this important work of education, and coupled with the current meager salaries of teachers, I am even more afraid that I will not be able to exchange my labor for a bowl of rice. Moreover, I am a woman, an incompetent woman, with no relatives to rely on, and only a stubborn mother left. How can she help me? But precisely because I am a poor woman, I am indignant at the various oppressions that women suffer in society. I don't believe that women cannot be independent in society, and I don't accept that women are subordinate to men, only using beauty and flattery to win the ugly and contemptible favor of men. I think that women today seem to have jumped out of the circle of feudal forces in words, but in fact, women in poverty are no better off than women in the past! (Of course, some wealthy so-called 'liberated' ladies are just enjoying more of the materials of the new century, creating a larger batch of slaves to serve them.) We are subject to multiple oppressions, and under these pressures, I am still gasping for breath, groping on uneven paths, and unable to find a broad and flat road. The way out, the way out, is there really no way out for women born in darkness? No matter how harsh the environment, I must strive for my way out, as well as the way out for all unfortunate women! On this, I ask for your help, hoping that you will treat me more sincerely, not abandon me, and warmly reach out your hand to me..."

I remember that after I finished reading this letter, I was deeply moved. I seemed to see her standing tall, raising her arms, and shouting loudly. Her face still had traces of undried tears, and her bright eyes sparkled with the light of hope. Ah, her posture was so moving, her voice was so full of strength, I really wanted to run to her side and warmly kiss her, sincerely tell her that I loved her, helped her, and gave her my great respect!

I remember that I immediately replied to her with a letter, pouring out my enthusiasm to her. At that time, I really thought she was my best friend. But after that, I never received another letter from her for a long time. I was concerned about her life and current situation, and I wrote letters to ask from time to time, but there was no news. This made me feel strange and uneasy mixed with disappointment. After some time passed, I accidentally heard some news about her from a fellow villager, saying that she had been betrothed to the young master of a wealthy merchant, and that the wedding would be held next spring, and that she would stop studying this winter. When I heard this at the time, I was very surprised, but later I smiled dismissively, thinking that this was just a joke about her. Although she was already nineteen years old, for the sake of her way out, for the sake of her long-cherished aspirations, for the sake of her career, she believed that she would never abandon her unfinished studies to go to the side of a man who did not understand her heart, sell her freedom, confine herself to her bridal chamber, and enjoy corrupt happiness! What's more, she would never forget me - not to say that I was her lover, that she should only love me and not love others, but to say that she should know that I have the courage to move forward, a righteous stance, and dare to grope on small roads, and would not stop until I had found a way out for humanity! As for whether she regarded me as her lover, or whether she must succeed in love with me, that was never what I cared about?

Doubting this news, another year passed in a hurry. This spring, I still didn't receive a letter from her. Because I was so busy with things, I was too lazy to write a letter. I waited, waited, and finally today I received this "red" news, this red invitation card!

Ah, she did marry the son of that wealthy merchant!

Her actions were out of the blue, and this unexpected attack left me cold and speechless. A spark of anger burst out in the wordlessness, but then it returned to calm. Yes, what can I blame her for? When she was young, she was timid and weak-willed. In the depths of her heart, she still harbored the earnest admonitions of her mother, who was the embodiment of Confucian ethics. Later, it was hard for her to learn about the new trends of the world from other friends, and to understand the true meaning of life. However, in the end, because she still had a sweet aftertaste for the old remnants, and loved her mother more than the new world, she wanted to win her mother's favor with her filial piety, so that her mother could enjoy the blessings of her old age. So she quietly bid farewell to her fellow travelers, and fell into the arms of a wastrel, following her mother's wishes! Perhaps a woman doesn't necessarily have to say goodbye to her career after marriage. Of course, I am willing to sincerely see that she does not forget her words of a year ago, and give me this belief with the proof of facts. However, if she really does this, she will have to abandon her happiness after marriage and prepare to accept new pains. In that case, this is not what I should say to her when she invites me to have wedding wine.

I have seen how many enthusiastic young people, determined to find their way out, finally turned around and threw themselves into their "destination." In the "destination," there seemed to be affectionate comfort and the sweetness of family affection. Thus, those who dared to cut through thorns and brambles to open up a flat way out for themselves and for humanity temporarily felt the news of loneliness. However, looking up into the distance, I faintly saw a glimmer of light beyond the horizon. I resolutely stood up, waved away the unnamed disturbance of being bound, and couldn't help but smile again in my heart.

The way out, is there really no way out?

### Remembering South Lake

— Qing Zeng

Jiaxing, the central station of the Shanghai-Hangzhou line, the second railway to be completed in our country, is such a mysterious and beautiful ancient city! That's right! Fifteen years ago, she was still surrounded by winding city walls, and the middle section of the main street of the county still retained the great and solemn, but now dead and silent, yamen. Although there are no longer the shouts and fierce yamen runners of the past inside, the pair of stone lions in front of the gate are still baring their teeth and claws as always. On Ping Mountain, not far from the yamen, an iron-rusted, copper-green, thickly accumulated earth cannon stands high... Everything reveals a mysterious and classical beauty. Within the breeding of these beauties, there is a well-known South Lake.

South Lake! She is not as heavily made up as the Qinhuai Lake, nor does she have the pleasure boats like clouds of the West Lake, but her beauty of being free from vulgarity makes the world-famous West Lake and Qinhuai Lake willingly take a back seat. Look! She has clear, bottomless neighboring waves, layers of solemn palaces in the heart of the lake, steles hidden under embracing trees, and the Eastern Pagoda standing far away... She can make travelers linger, she can make tourists intoxicated.

On the north shore of this famous lake, there is a tall building echoing the palaces in the lake from afar. This is my home. He is a forever young warrior, standing巍峨independently in the long years. She knew my young grandmother, saw my father at birth, and of course she was even more familiar with the happy me at that time—that's right! She saw me with a kind grandmother and loving parents, who nurtured me like this, and cultivated me like this.

Every evening, when the setting sun fell and the evening smoke curled up, my father liked to wander on the willow embankment by the lake, waiting for me to come home from school. From afar, I opened my little hands and jumped into his arms. Then he habitually took off my schoolbag, happily asked about the schoolwork, or told an interesting story. I leaned on him, gazed at the beauty of nature, and listened to relaxed and interesting stories. Time passed in our happy laughter, and the bells of the temple on the opposite lake echoed in the empty space of the lake, and the night gradually unfolded in the solemn, slow bells. Only then did we reluctantly embark on the way home.

When the hot summer came, South Lake embraced various yachts from morning to night. The railway opened special trains for tourists, and the boat girls competed to attract tourists, rowed their painted boats, and our family's dinner was often happily enjoyed on the blue waves. The heat of the sun was driven away outside the awning of the boat, and the cool breeze blew unobstructed from the water, bringing the sound of gurgling water and intoxicating laughter. At dusk, when the charming moon rose and the stars first appeared, many yachts left with tired voices, staggering away and slowly drifting away. Returning to the quiet South Lake, she was like a maiden with silent affection, adding a bit more charm and tenderness. At this time, I loved to listen to my grandmother or mother telling stories about South Lake. The stories were so extensive! The palaces in the heart of the lake, she had stayed the traces of Sui Yangdi and Qianlong's travels, the clear blue water, he had even reflected the shadows of Xi Shi and Fan Li, I listened excitedly and curiously! Listening! The moon had already stolen over our heads, I stared at the palaces bathed in silver light, and the lakes filled with mercury, and a string of historical illusions floated in my mind, and my intoxicated heart wandered in the moonlight! Oops! Finally, the soul was called back by the leisurely sound of returning home.

Although my family's courtyard was not dyed with brilliant and magnificent colors, I loved him more than everything else, perhaps because of the mentality that "there is no place like home". The sunny bedroom, he faced the beautiful South Lake squarely, the spacious and bright dining room, it was the place where we laughed during meals. I loved my little studio even more, he was quietly perched in the southeast corner. When I occasionally looked up from my desk, I could see the sails floating on the lake and the distant shadows of the pagoda... All of these made me deeply love, satisfied, and intoxicated.

On the tablet of my young heart, I was able to inscribe and understand my father's often recited poem: "South embraces the beautiful lake light, east welcomes the high pagoda shadow." This sentence praising the scenery of my home is so accurate and appropriate!

Childhood! That happy childhood finally flew away, and even that beautiful home had long become a relic. The old dream like morning glow nine years ago disappeared without a trace. Only the beautiful South Lake, I heard that she is still lonely and quiet. I can't bear to see her, and I don't want to see her, because I imagine that she must be old! She must have turned into a sentimental old woman, because she has seen all the sins and has seen all the vicissitudes. I hate my clumsy brushstrokes, and I can't finish writing the memories that knock on my heartstrings, but this can already give me a moment of satisfaction with the vision in my mind and stir up some beautiful ripples in my heart.

### The Solitary One

— Liu Lin

Last night, I met him again. I felt his face was familiar. Time had separated me from him, and I felt his visit was abrupt. But in my loneliness, I still treated my guest with a welcoming heart.

He took off his greatcoat, which was full of wind and frost, like an old sail boat removing its sails. He looked around my room: gray walls, gray windows, messy books and furniture, and then he put away his awkward expression.

Memories reminded me that he was a person accustomed to living in solitude, and I had to avoid those polite greetings.

"You haven't changed your solitary nature, have you!"

"It won't change," he said after a long silence. "It's my personality."

I remembered him once saying: "The reason why I am lonely and self-possessed is partly because I grew up in a gloomy house. And when I was young, I didn't have playmates close to my age..." So I asked him:

"Now you shouldn't be fascinated by the spider webs in the corner of the room anymore." "Didn't I tell you before that I love the beautifully decorated fields, the golden rapeseed flowers, and the oily green grass..."

"Yes, you also told me that you were trying to transplant the delicate buds into your heart."

So the face of my friend was also dotted with vibrant green. I seemed to realize that he had also struggled in the whirlpool of life.

"But don't misunderstand me, I still wouldn't presume to that extent: thinking that everything in nature is arranged for me. In the morning, the little birds chirp happily with me. But in the evening, as my eyes follow the crows returning to their nests, I can only comfort myself with a silent sigh, and send away the time of the day."

"Then, can't you control your emotions?"

"Yes—but I have never thought that my life is humble. The heart must have a home; in this way, even in the bitter cold winter, I can still arrange a next spring, a beautiful spring suburb in my fantasy—and in winter, aren't the white snowflakes also lovely?"

"Well, your joyful emotions outweigh your sadness."

My friend lowered his head, and he stared at his own knees with bewildered eyes. In the dim light, I saw his wrinkled soul trembling. He raised his head, but I didn't dare to let my eyes meet his. I shouldn't touch the scars on his heart. Now, I think, what he found in silence may be emptiness, or pain. Who says silence is fulfilling?

I was also silent.

In the relative silence, the little joy brought by the rare meeting disappeared completely.

"But you know, later I also learned to think. Perhaps in thinking, I can find the mystery of emotions."

"Then you can't help but doubt the things around you." I didn't add my note: "Doubt is an incomprehensible brooding."

"Do you think doubt is useless? It at least paints a few strokes on a blank life. It is in the contemplative thoughts of doubt that I can retrieve something from life."

He cast a glance at me with apprehensive eyes: "I said that thinking certainly throws me into the circle of doubt, but, I finally jumped out of this circle again. I got what I wanted to pursue, and also cultivated my desire and longing for pursuit."

"That's great." I realized that it was not normal to follow his thoughts with urgent questions. "I'm afraid what I lack is this desire and longing."

I didn't dare to make a frank expression. Sometimes, out of deceptive comfort and sympathy, it can also bring each other closer, right!

Then he said: "At first, I really believed that life should return to nature, and there should be no anger, joy, and such, just like those stoic philosophers advocated. But later I admired Tolstoy even more, and believed that the beauty of life he advocated lies in spring and love, and what I pursue is this kind of beauty..."

"This kind of beauty is somewhat close to the metaphysical."

"Yes, this is an invisible beauty..."

I couldn't break the dull air. Otherwise, I had endless questions to ask him: "Are we forgivers, lovers, or forgiven, loved ones?"... Thinking of entertaining guests, I was willing to hand him a cigarette.

"Let the moldy cigarette stretch your mind."

He took the cigarette with one hand, and pressed my shoulder tightly with the other, and said enthusiastically:

"You know, in these years, I have always been thinking about you. Sometimes, you give me enthusiasm, and sometimes it is revelation—you shouldn't have forgotten me, right?"

I thought dejectedly that I didn't have to tell him: I rarely think of him.

### Movie Notes

— Qianghua

After Seeing "Double Pearls in a Sea of People"

Coming out of the theater, I strolled leisurely down the street. Spring was only lingering with its last vestiges, and the night air already carried the scent of early summer. It was still early, and shadows of people intertwined on the street. Something seemed to be rippling in my heart. It was a faint, slightly melancholic feeling that had been picked up from the silver screen.

What I had just watched at the theater was a new film directed and written by Sang Hu, "Double Pearls in a Sea of People." It contained no life-or-death struggles, no thrilling or shocking scenes. The author simply used his keen observation and gentle, graceful techniques to bring the audience into the world he had created. The characters on the screen seemed like people we all knew; their joys and sorrows were closely related to our own. These were characters refined by art, and thus were warm and intimate.

The story was extremely simple: a pair of sisters from the lower middle class, both gentle and intelligent, yet burdened by the hardships of life. They quietly and without complaint shouldered the burdens of the world, walking forward in their ordinary lives. Mr. Sang Hu gave the characters he created the greatest sympathy, and from that wrote a kind of inescapable sadness for the floating world. The female protagonist invited her boyfriend home for dinner, but many unexpected farcical events occurred, eventually leading to a breakup. The older sister lent her new dress, a gift from her lover, to her younger sister, which happened to be seen by the gift-giver, leading to emotional distress. The male protagonist was suffering from romantic troubles and was ordered by his muddleheaded superior to act as a matchmaker between his girlfriend and his superior. … They were all kind and innocent, yet fate mocked them at every turn. Even the most well-intentioned actions often became ridicule for them.

Last year I saw "Long Live the Teacher," and now, after seeing "Double Pearls in a Sea of People," Mr. Sang Hu's progress is very obvious. From a directing perspective, the whole film is harmonious and natural. It flows like clouds and water, returning from splendor to simplicity, which is to say, moving from artificiality to maturity. His greatest achievement is his constant use of thought-provoking humor interspersed throughout, weaving waves of light and darkness that interact and build upon each other. The regrettable thing is that the scenes depicting sadness are not deep enough, thus unintentionally reducing the work's depth and weakening its power to deeply move the heart.

However, I was clearly captivated by that faint melancholy. Walking down the street on this late spring night, I lingered for a long time in that indefinable emotion.

### The Flute Seller

— Wu Bian

In the fading sunlight,

An old man,

Gray hair beneath a torn cap,

The melodious sound of the flute enveloping

The street bathed in the setting sun,

Tenderly enchanting

The souls of passersby,

Closer and closer.

Wrinkled skin, protruding crystalline droplets,

Hazy eyes filled with light sorrow,

You, perhaps, recall the past,

By the green stream, on the fields,

Riding an ox, singing loudly.

Do not,

Chase after him to ask,

If a day's hard work can buy a liter of rice?

Let him walk with his faltering steps,

Let him quietly play his flute,

With a ray of setting sun shining on him, going far, far away.

### Reading "Dreams Under the Stars"

— Fang Xuan

A writer once said something rather witty: poetry is the "big shot" among literary works. Indeed, why are other parts of literary works packed tightly together, while only a few lines of short poetry occupy a large space? If we simply break up prose and arrange it line by line, or add some riddle-like phrases, and call it "poetry," then there could be nothing more unfair in the world. But fortunately, there are several songsmiths who, in this barren land, "are willing to become earthworms"; their "goods" calm us down. They use language that is neither extravagant nor excessive, along with reasonable rhythms, to awaken the imagination of us readers. Who says that this large blank space is a waste? Following the rhythm of the poetry, isn't it filled with the colors, sounds, emotions, and twists and turns of the story that the author wants to tell?

Poet Ge Qingchun is one who strives in this area. After reading his recently published collection, "Dreams Under the Stars," one cannot help but marvel at the author's magnificent language, expanded vision, and rich imagination. The poet has inexpressible anger and pity for the myriad aspects of human life, and he vents his emotions with his colorful strokes. "One day spring will bring sunlight and flowers, and the south wind will send the signal of poetry, and I will sing and bless you." Think about it, in what kind of mood did he write so many poems? Isn't what he expects what we expect? Aren't his loves and hates our loves and hates?

In "Imprisoned Lion," "Life," "School Opening," "Homesickness," and "Minzi, You Are Still Young," we can glimpse the author's sincere emotions. He is angered by the injustices of the world, and seems to have an irrepressible sorrow, but this sorrow is uplifting, enabling him to further recognize the face of this society. Under the title "Life," he wrote these lines:

Life is like a tired horse that has traveled ten thousand miles,

Stumbling at the city gate,

Even if you are a hero unmatched by ten thousand,

Or a veteran who has been on the battlefield for a long time,

How can you withstand the falling of a thousand-jin gate?

One day, it will crush you

Into a lump of flesh!

In "Homesickness," it is not merely a cry of despair; he paints a bleak picture:

These years, drought and war intertwine,

Wealthy families sell their fields and houses, fearing robbery and theft.

The poor can only wander to other places.

Thinking of my aging parents,

Leaning on the door, longing for their children,

Adding more white hair?

Furthermore, in "Abandoned Infant," the author's artistic conscience is even more evident. He rejects ornate and skilled verses, and instead takes up living colloquial language, writing that a baby is "born from filth, and in filth you will perish." A pitiful tragedy, which he concisely narrates in dozens of lines of poetry, followed by a compassionate cry at the end!

No one will remember you

— except your mother

Nor will anyone have the leisure

To pity you.

Because the cruelty of the world has taught people

That pity cannot save you,

And tears cannot accomplish great things,

The difficulties before them demand that they

Endure even greater hardships to come!

Ge Qingchun's poems are unique in the integrity of their forms and the conciseness of their lines. I would not dare say that his poems have reached the state of ultimate perfection, but on the whole, the various forms of poetry he has written have no major flaws in their technique. In "Dreams Under the Stars," "On the River," "May Rain," "Sunflower," "I Love," and "Dove Bell," we can cite many lovely lines, showing the maturity of his technique, capturing the reader's reverie and giving a feeling of emotional comfort. Especially in the few short lines of "Cold Garden," both the sentence structure and the rhythm show the author's extraordinary talent—:

The days are like tightly strung musical strings,

Rarely having a moment of leisure,

Delightful are the small hands of the children,

Leading me to the desolate, withered garden.

Breaking off a reed as a spear,

The yellow grass all over the ground is

Considered a battlefield.

Recalling the heroic spirit of Zhou Yu at the Battle of Red Cliffs,

I sit on the ground, watching a grass-battle.

Laughing at the heroes on horseback falling off their backs.

The defeated child this time plays

Cao Cao at the burning of the camps!

In short, if Ge Qingchun continues to work hard, he has a future in the "territory of poetry." It is hoped that he will develop his poetic career by recognizing reality and enriching his life, and by telling the sorrows, angers, and laughter that we all share. Then, the gifts he gives us in the future will be able to arouse our resonance even more. (Dreams Under the Stars, published by Fiction Monthly)

### Unprecedented Grandeur and Wonderful Performances: A Commentary on the White Horse vs. Overseas Chinese United Match

— Special Reporter

For the eighth Welfare Football Match, the authorities invited the White Horse team to compete against the Overseas Chinese United team. Given the strong momentum of this year's Overseas Chinese United team and the rejuvenated lineup of the White Horse team, various circles had been eagerly awaiting this match ever since the news was announced, until the day of the competition (the 10th). Although the match started at 5:00 PM, football fans had already started arriving in droves from 3:00 PM. The great attraction was evident. The purpose of this Welfare Match was to donate to the landlords of Chefu, who benefited greatly. This reporter will provide a commentary on the match and introduce various aspects of the White Horse team.

Cheng Bo'an Discusses the Establishment of White Horse

Considering the impressive reputation of the White Horse team, the reporter interviewed the team's leader, Cheng Bo'an, after the match. Mr. Cheng first discussed the establishment of the White Horse team. It was formed last summer during the Fuhua Cup mini-league organized by the Fuhua Tobacco Company. Its members were top players from the Donghua and Lianyi teams, temporarily named White Horse. With so many talented players, their performance was indeed excellent and breathtaking. This year, the Overseas Chinese United team, composed of righteous generals, repeatedly challenged strong teams. Because of this, the White Horse team had the desire to rise again. They gathered all their members and submitted an application to the Football Association authorities, who approved their participation in the eighth Welfare Match. The team was determined to win, so they conducted practice and review sessions before the match, which resulted in their excellent performance today. As for the White Horse brand of cigarettes produced by Fuhua, it was to commemorate the White Horse team.

Unprecedented Enthusiastic Situation

Due to the great appeal of both teams, the atmosphere was more lively than expected. All radio stations in Shanghai broadcasted the match on that day, which was unprecedented in recent years. Countless fans could listen to the progress of the battle without having to travel back and forth. The white ball used in the match was different from the usual ball. It was dazzling and added to the excitement of the match. It is said that the ball was planned by Xu Zhihao, the White Horse team's strategist, which showed originality and ingenuity. In order to meet the grand occasion, the White Horse authorities specially compiled a special publication, which was distributed to fans on the spot, further increasing their interest. All of these things were rare in other matches.

The Match Process Was Extremely Tense

The battle was delayed until 5:25 PM due to the late arrival of the White Horse team members. White Horse kicked off first, occupying the upwind position. However, with the spirit of each team member, they attacked with all their strength, and their momentum was unmatched. The Overseas Chinese United righteous army was momentarily at a loss, allowing White Horse to trample. Fortunately, goalkeeper Mai Nidi was agile and avoided disaster. The sharpness of the five White Horse forwards was praised by the fans. Unexpectedly, under the circumstances of White Horse's long attack without success, Overseas Chinese United took the lead in the 26th minute thanks to a corner kick opportunity. Vila kicked the ball, and Artomarri successfully headed it in, scoring the first goal. The White Horse team members could not help but lose color. Until just before the end of the first half, luckily, Sun Jinshun responded swiftly, attacked alone, and used his strong footwork to break the net with one kick. Cheers thundered, and the first half ended in a 1-1 tie.

In the second half, White Horse switched to the downwind position, and their offensive was even more prosperous. So, one only saw the five forwards charging left and right, the three midfielders blocking the incoming soldiers, the defenders handling with ease, and Zhang Banglun's business became bleak. In the 20th minute, Song Lingsheng and Jia Youliang frequently passed the ball short and drove down, and at the appropriate point, Jia Youliang fed the ball to Sun Jinshun, whose position was excellent, and he was able to use his only foot to perform a wonderful volley. The Overseas Chinese United's goal was broken again. The joy of the audience seemed drunk and crazy. In the 30th minute, Sun Jinshun received another pass from Li and succeeded again. White Horse was leading 3-1. The righteous army was short of breath and unable to rally. However, three minutes before the end of the match, Zhang Lingen carelessly fouled in the penalty area and was penalized with a penalty kick. Sirati scored the penalty, allowing Overseas Chinese United to chase back one goal. White Horse finally defeated the Overseas Chinese United team, which had a remarkable record this season and had won the Mayor's Cup and International Cup titles, by a score of 3-2. Domestic fans were all delighted.

White Horse Rushed Fiercely, Overseas Chinese United Was Conservative

White Horse had Han Longhai rush back to help, because he knew that the Overseas Chinese United's defense was a deathly guard. With Longhai's fierce rushing, it would be threatening. Therefore, from the moment he came on the field, he absolutely adopted this tactic. As a result, the Overseas Chinese United's defenders tried their best to concentrate on Han Longhai. Luo Xulai could not mark him firmly, so Sirati filled in from behind. Therefore, Sun Jinshun had many opportunities. Li was also active from time to time, so under such circumstances, it was natural for the White Horse forwards to be active. Secondly, Song Ling's forward rushing had the ability to assist in the attack, so it was another reason why the White Horse's offensive was so strong. The White Horse's five forwards advanced in a straight line, making their conservative defense difficult to cope with, which was another good strategy. Therefore, the fact that White Horse controlled the offensive throughout the match was by no means a fluke.

The reason for the Overseas Chinese United's defeat was entirely that they paid too much attention to guarding Han Longhai, and in fact did not pay attention to Han Longhai, which had the possibility of being infiltrated. Once attention was paid, the rest of the generals were able to find gaps. Their forward deployment was to use Artomari as the left winger. According to Artomari, he was originally an inner forward and had the power to return to assist in defense. I don't know why he was moved to the left, which reduced the defensive momentum, which was the biggest mistake in strategy.

### The Volleyball Season Begins: A Discussion of the Serving Rules

The volleyball season has already arrived, and it seems necessary to discuss the rules. Last year, the Shanghai Volleyball League proceeded smoothly, but unfortunately, the referees had differing opinions on the jumping movement during serving, which led to mutual accusations. According to the explicit provisions of the volleyball rules, there is absolutely no ambiguity. Therefore, this article extracts one or two articles of the rules, hoping that all players will pay attention to them. On the other hand, it is hoped that members of the Volleyball Referee Association will correct them, which would be greatly appreciated!

The full text of the second example in Article 7 of the Volleyball Rules, Game Rules, states: "When the game begins, the first person in the serving order of the team that serves first shall use one hand (open palm or clenched fist) to serve the ball into the opponent's zone from over the net. When serving, the player's feet shall stand behind the end line (that is, the end line is the furthest point from the net) and the surface is between the extended lines of the two side lines. From the time of preparing to serve until the ball is hit, the foot must not cross the end line. The server may continue to serve until the referee announces "attack failure." At this time, the first person in the serving order of the opposing team will take turns to serve." A note is added below: "If there is not enough open space outside the court and the serving action cannot be carried out, a serving line may be drawn at an appropriate distance in front of the end line." Among them, the phrase "When serving, the player's feet shall stand behind the end line" clearly states: "Both" feet "stand" behind the end line. Lifting one foot and standing with one foot is already inappropriate. Strictly speaking, lifting one foot is already a foul, let alone jumping with both feet! This is one point. Some say that the serve of Mr. Ke Yongzhan, the Far Eastern representative of our country, first retreats a certain distance and then advances to serve. This matter does not contradict the rules. It is permissible to run the entire field before serving. When serving, stand still and strike the ball. If it is forced to be interpreted according to the rules of basketball, it is wrong. Basketball rules cannot be used to explain volleyball rules. Conversely, volleyball rules cannot be used to explain basketball rules.

### Linhua Bank Promotes Sports for Bank Employees

Therefore, this year they continued to hold the second Linhua Cup mini-ball tournament, and will double their efforts to meet the initial intentions.

### Essential Principles of Basketball (19)

— Liang Zhao'an

In conclusion, while the above two types of defensive methods each have their own advantages and disadvantages, they each have their own value in application. For example, the main purpose of using the five-man zone defense is to conserve energy and defend against the screen (or pick) offense. However, when using this defensive method, all five players must be able to retreat rapidly at the same time when the team loses possession. Otherwise, if the opponent launches a fast break, it will be impossible to stop their momentum. The biggest weakness of this type of defense is that it cannot pressure the opponent's offense. Therefore, when the opponent has a higher score and adopts a slow-paced offense, or passes the ball among themselves on the perimeter to run out the game clock in order to maintain their scoring lead and secure the victory, you must not stick to this method. You should immediately switch to a man-to-man defense, forcing the opponent to attack, in order to win back possession through their mistakes and launch a counterattack. The main purpose of using "man-to-man" defense is to disrupt the opponent's formation and force them to attack hastily, leaving them no time to catch their breath. However, when using this defensive method, the first priority is that your team's players can appropriately control enemy players based on a real power comparison. Otherwise, if even one person is not able to match the opponent's ability, it will become a weakness, creating a great danger. The biggest shortcoming of this defensive method is that it cannot effectively counter the screen offense, and it is also very energy-consuming. It is not suitable for teams with lower skill levels or older players. Therefore, when encountering an opponent using a screen offense, you must switch to a five-man zone defense, with each person strictly guarding a zone, using the strategy of responding to change with unchanging principles to resist their unpredictable screen plays. When there are four defenders against three attackers, or when the opponent already has three or more defenders, the possibility of a fast break gradually disappears. Therefore, resourceful and skilled teams, after gaining possession of the ball each time, will first look for this kind of opportunity. If a fast break is not possible, then they will consider other tactics.

Generally speaking, the fast break is best suited for larger courts and breaking the five-man zone defense. However, those who adopt this tactic, the prerequisite is that the whole team members are more outstanding than the average person, high technical level, familiar with basic movements, sensitive perception, observation and strong judgment, can cooperate and improvise, and overall strategy, can be effective also.

### (B) Positional Offense

The so-called positional offense refers to attacking after the offensive and defensive lines are formed. There are various names for it: namely the figure-eight offense, diagonal attack, central penetration, sideline infiltration, outside attack with inside response, rotation offense, pivot offense, stalling tactics, etc.
