### Korean Landscape and Customs

[United Press Seoul Telegram, 10th] Korea, also known as Joseon, as the name suggests, should be a land full of fresh vitality. However, for 4,300 years, there has been no peaceful day. Wars, rebellions, and conspiracies have emerged endlessly, so foreigners call it the "Eastern Ireland." Koreans are taller than Japanese, and their skin is fairer. Japanese workers hate them quite a bit, probably because Koreans are hardworking and can work harder than others even when they are hungry. They can be compared to Chinese farmers and are far beyond the reach of the Japanese. Seventy-five percent of Korean land is cultivated by tenant farmers. Under Japanese rule, each person averaged only two bushels of rice per year. Koreans, unlike the Japanese, like to eat meat, but they regard slaughtering as a humble profession. Scholars have the highest status, deeply influenced by the traditional Chinese thought of "all occupations are inferior, only studying is superior." Korean mythology claims to be descendants of heavenly gods. According to legend, an ancient god took pity on human beings and personally came down to the lower realm. He saw a chaste woman by the water and conceived after being blown with immortal air, giving birth to the ancestor of the Koreans. Korean religion is a mixture of primitive worship, Buddhism, and Confucianism, but in recent years, influenced by Europe and the United States, more and more people believe in Christianity. The Korean population is about 23 million, and there are about 500,000 Christians, of whom 287,000 belong to the Presbyterian Church and 115,000 belong to the Catholic Church. Koreans like to wear American-style hats, and there are even more people wearing Western suits than in Tokyo. In the old Korean custom, both men and women wore white clothes. It is said that this custom originated hundreds of years ago, when the authorities were in mourning for the king for three years, and the people uniformly wore white. Unexpectedly, the kings who succeeded to the throne did not live long, and three of them died in succession, so mourning clothes became everyday clothes. But today, influenced by foreign countries, this custom is gradually being abolished. It is said that the Japanese especially hate white clothes and often like to splash ink on Korean clothes and force them to be dyed. Koreans regard the Japanese as cultural upstarts, because Japan's import of Chinese culture was first indirectly transmitted from Korea. Forgetting their roots, the Japanese are unjust. Movable type printing was introduced to Korea from China fifty years before it was invented in Europe, which shows how early it was civilized. In 1592, they used ironclad ships to fight and destroy the Japanese fleet, 300 years earlier than Perry's bombardment of Japan. Japanese-published travel guides claim that Korean youths can enjoy modern education, but in reality, only 18 percent attend school. In Japan, 99 percent are forced to receive general education. The true policy of the Japanese in governing Korea can be seen in the words of a certain governor-general: "Koreans can be made to do things, but cannot be made to know things." Most of the true education of Koreans was founded and operated by foreign missionaries, so the Japanese hate them to the bone. Korean houses are mostly mud-walled flat houses with grass or tile roofs. The ground is paved with stone slabs and covered with mats or oiled paper. The stove chimney passes under the stone slabs for heating, which is a very clever method. The Korean territory is a peninsula, but its land is mostly mountainous, with only 25 percent of the total area being arable land. Rice is the main agricultural product. Under Japanese rule, one-third of the annual harvest was taken by the Japanese. The land is barren, so human waste is used as fertilizer, so there is a risk of contracting dysentery and typhoid fever from eating fresh vegetables. Korean families are headed by the mother-in-law, which is also a strange custom. Usually, the man is the head of the household, and his wife is in charge of domestic affairs, but once his son marries a wife, the daughter-in-law is responsible for the work, and the mother-in-law comes with her, taking over the role of host and acting as the ruler of the whole family.

### American Newspaper Reviews the Situation in China, Saying That the Communist Party Uses Any Means Necessary to Damage the Nation and Alienate Sino-American-Soviet-British Friendship

[United Press, Los Angeles, 10th] An editorial in the "Herald Express" stated: A strong and unified China is closely related to world security, and the United Nations should assist China when necessary to restore peace in North China. The involvement of the United States in the North China dispute is also for this reason. We should examine the Chinese Communist Party with a realistic eye, looking at its motives and actions. It must be known that the Chinese Communist Party is a political party, not a country. What it wants to seize by force is usually resolved by voting, without the need for bullets. They have actually exhausted all the methods within their power, such as frontal attacks, conspiracies to sabotage, malicious propaganda, and other vicious methods, to damage the Republic of China and alienate China's friendship with the Soviet Union, Britain, and the United States. Its purpose is to overthrow China's organized government, and this must not be allowed to happen. In this situation, the United States and the United Nations should assist China in establishing a truly representative government, so that the Communist Party and other parties have the right to be heard in national affairs and to vote in elections. As a political party, the Chinese Communist Party should have freedom of speech and the right to vote, but if it holds armed forces, it must be disarmed and dispersed. Therefore, if necessary, the United Nations should use force to assist the legitimate government of China so that North China can regain peace. Once this fact is , Chairman Chiang should convene a national conference to formulate wise laws to produce a representative government, the sooner the better.

### Special Commentary: Enterprise Capital and Tax Issues in Recovered Areas

— Wang Zhi

Capital, as the term is used here, refers to the total assets of an enterprise minus all liabilities, representing the net worth. When an enterprise begins, capital is immediately put to use, and the value of the assets increases or decreases accordingly. Profits and losses are therefore inevitable. The original invested capital only represents the amount invested by shareholders and the number of shares held; it cannot represent the net worth of the enterprise. This is quite obvious. Unfortunately, the standard adopted by our country's current income tax system only considers the actually paid-up capital or the actually invested principal. For those with reserve funds, only one-third is allowed to be included in the capital calculation, and the tax rate is determined according to the ratio of net profit to the amount of capital. The principle of full progressive taxation is used, making the determination of the capital amount crucial to the amount of tax payable.

Since the War of Resistance, currency inflation and devaluation have caused most industrial and commercial enterprises to show huge profits when calculated in monetary terms. Some of these profits are indeed from operating income, but most are due to currency devaluation. Merchants in the recovered areas, in order to protect their original assets and avoid excessive donations during the enemy's occupation, have tried to evade taxes. Some hid assets in reserve funds, others hid them in inventory, and some even fabricated accounts to conceal assets. Commercial ethics have also deteriorated completely. Now that the War of Resistance has been won, the central government is trying to encourage production and promote investment. It may be beneficial to take advantage of the situation where merchants want to re-adjust their capital amount but are constrained by the tax system. The method of collecting business profit tax for both categories A and B in 1945 should be temporarily revised to achieve the principle of taxing profits without harming the principal. This way, the old hidden and false practices of the industrial and commercial sectors can be restored along with the land. Based on my limited understanding, I propose the following measures for adjusting enterprise capital for reference in levying business profit tax. I hope that knowledgeable people can provide corrections.

(1) The adjustment of capital should be based on the actual situation of each enterprise. — The capital situation of each enterprise is different. Some were originally valued in legal tender and converted to puppet currency at a rate of two to one in June 1942. Some were originally converted from legal tender to puppet currency and then increased capital with puppet currency. Some new enterprises have used puppet currency as the unit of account from the beginning. The situations vary. If we convert the book puppet currency amount of the first type of enterprise to legal tender at a rate of 200 to one, then a million-dollar enterprise before the war would now only have 2,500 yuan in capital. Therefore, a huge amount of assets would be designated as profits and subject to income tax. This is too unfair and would only deter future investors, which goes against the government's intention to encourage enterprises. I believe that the establishment period of each enterprise is different, the currency value at that time is different, and the gains and losses of their operations are also different. Therefore, the adjustment of capital should be determined based on the actual situation of each enterprise and should not be based on the rate of 200 to one. The government has no explicit regulation requiring enterprise capital to be converted to legal tender at a rate of 200 to one. The proclamation issued by Commander-in-Chief He in August this year stated that private creditor-debtor relationships should be allowed to be settled independently. Therefore, my capital adjustment method does not conflict with the law. I hope that after adjusting the capital amount, there will be no more attempts to hide assets, and previously hidden assets will be re-entered into the accounts. From now on, the government should use the rule of law as the standard, and merchants should use honesty as the best policy.

(2) Labor should not be entitled to capital gains. — Some say that the adjustment of capital depends on the allocation of capital gains, and this capital gain may cause labor-capital disputes internally. I believe that all gains arising from currency devaluation and property appreciation are capital gains. For example, if a house originally valued at 10,000 yuan in 1937 is now worth 2 million yuan, the difference of 1.99 million yuan is a capital gain, not a profit from business operations. Labor should not be entitled to it.

(3) Method of calculating capital gains. — China has never had accurate price statistics. However, to calculate the capital gains of each enterprise itself, I believe that it is only necessary to use the assets related to the main business operated by the enterprise itself as the standard. The price index outside the business scope is difficult to obtain for a while, and it is not necessary to obtain it. The reason why shareholders invest in an enterprise is that they believe that the enterprise has investment value and are interested in it. They should not seek unexpected income outside the business. The government also does not allow merchants to operate businesses outside their scope. Therefore, Article 22 of the new Company Law stipulates that "a company shall not operate businesses outside its registered scope." From this point of view, to seek capital gains, one can subtract the start-up expenses from the amount of share capital paid up by an enterprise, and then use the price index of the fixed assets and main raw materials and goods necessary for the enterprise at that time as the base. Then, use the current price index of the same assets to find the percentage. Multiply the remainder by this percentage and subtract the original capital amount to get the enterprise's capital gains. The equation is:

A = Capital amount; B = Start-up expenses; C = Percentage of the current price index to the price index when the share capital was paid up; D = Capital gains.

[(A - B) × C%] - A = D

For example, a weaving factory was established in 1937 with a capital of 100,000 yuan. The necessary start-up expenses at that time were 30,000 yuan, leaving a balance of 70,000 yuan. Now it seems certain that it should be fully invested in fixed equipment and cotton yarn, dyes, and coal necessary for the textile industry. If the price index ratio of these assets is 30,000%, then substitute into the above equation to find that its capital gains are 20.9 million yuan. If an enterprise has increased its capital several times in the middle, then the increased portion should be calculated separately in stages according to when each installment of capital was paid up, using the above method. The sum of these is the enterprise's capital gains from the beginning to the present. If you want to make this calculation precise, then when deriving the price index, you should select important assets and include them in the statistical materials, and calculate them together according to the proportion that each asset should account for in the total capital, based on the actual situation. The percentage of the index obtained should be more accurate. If the materials are not selected carefully, the calculation will be unreliable. For example, financial institutions can include interest rates, securities, and foreign exchange. If financial institutions include cotton yarn, coal, etc., they will lose their accuracy.

(4) The drawbacks of excessively high property appreciation. — If all capital gains are transferred to capital, there will inevitably be many drawbacks. Now that the War of Resistance has ended, transportation has resumed, all industries have been revived, prices have fallen, and the currency value will gradually recover. If the capital gains generated by currency devaluation are fully used as capital, losses will inevitably occur when the currency value rises in the future, which is not a stable way to run an enterprise. Moreover, if property appreciates too much, resulting in excessive profits, if a few shareholders do not want to continue investing, they can assert their rights and demand that cash be distributed under that profit item. The right to receive dividends and the right to receive gifts are private rights, which are different from public rights such as voting and election, and cannot be enforced by law. Also, if the appreciation is too high, losses will inevitably occur when the currency value recovers in the future, and both labor and national taxes will suffer losses, which is not what accounting should do. I do not take it. From this point of view, the standard of property appreciation should be moderate and stable.

Therefore, I hope that the income tax of 1945 can be revised to use the adjusted capital amount of each enterprise as the standard, and then calculate the ratio of income amount to this adjusted capital amount to determine the tax rate to be levied. At the same time, the portion of capital gains transferred to capital should be exempt from taxation. And adopt a simplified tax collection method. — The income tax rates adopted in the United Kingdom and the United States are indeed very high, but the degree of currency devaluation in China is very different from that in the United Kingdom and the United States. The average price in the United States has only increased by 28% compared to 1939. The United Kingdom has also only increased by 30% compared to the same year. Therefore, the income tax in the United Kingdom and the United States does not damage the original capital of the enterprise. If our government strictly enforces the current tax rate, then the 1 million yuan of capital before the war mentioned in the above example would be converted to 2,500 yuan as imagined by the general public. If you want to restore the capital amount before the war, you must pay 199,500 yuan of income tax in the compensation amount of 997,500 yuan. If the capital gains arising from property appreciation are also regarded as ordinary profits, then the income tax will have taken most of the enterprise's property for the government. This is like draining the pond to catch all the fish. Now the government has repeatedly stated that it wants to revitalize industry and encourage people to invest. It can be seen that it will definitely not adopt the means used by Russia after the success of the Bolshevik Revolution in 1917 to confiscate private capital through the tax system. I deeply hope that the wise and wealthy authorities will sympathize with the difficulties of businessmen, and that all enterprises that transfer capital gains to capital will be exempt from tax, and that the tax collection method for the income tax of 1945 will be temporarily revised. It is hoped that China's young enterprises can slightly recover from their accumulated difficulties after eight years of war, and that the government will also be able to legislate loosely and enforce strictly.

In addition, the Belgian-owned Banque Belge pour l'Étranger requested the return of gold bars, British gold coins, and US gold coins taken from it and deposited in the Yokohama Specie Bank. Each case has been thoroughly investigated by the Enemy and Puppet Property Handling Bureau and submitted to yesterday's review meeting for approval, and will be returned to the original owners separately.

### General Wedemeyer States: Severely Punish U.S. Military Violators; Chinese Police Should Increase Assistance

U.S. Army Commander of the China Theater, General Wedemeyer, declared yesterday: He will take "severe disciplinary measures" to punish any U.S. soldiers in Shanghai who violate regulations, regardless of their rank. Wedemeyer told reporters that he is "determined to correct" the recent misconduct of U.S. military personnel in Shanghai, such as theft, brawls, disturbing the peace, and traffic violations. The number of civilians who died as a result of an accident involving a two-and-a-half-ton military truck on Saturday night has now reached four, with several others seriously injured. The truck crashed through one of the busiest areas of Shanghai. Although the driver who caused the accident has been wanted and a reward of 100,000 yuan in legal tender has been offered by the U.S. Army authorities, he has not yet been apprehended. He believes that one of the reasons for the increasing number of illegal acts by U.S. military personnel is that the Chinese police authorities are unwilling to stop the illegal actions of Americans in military uniform. Whenever an unfortunate incident occurs, the Chinese police often fail to record the names of the perpetrators and the license plate numbers of the vehicles, resulting in the authorities having no complete records for investigation. To help correct this situation, the U.S. military authorities are now issuing all military vehicles with a Chinese license plate. Wedemeyer further stated that there is a shortage of trained U.S. military police in Shanghai, as many military police officers have been sent back to the United States or transferred to other posts. He has asked Mayor Qian to instruct Chinese police officers to "take severe and swift steps" to arrest any Americans who cause accidents in the future.

Wedemeyer concluded: General MacArthur will not be able to come to China in the short term, but he has expressed his gratitude for Chairman Chiang's telegram. The remaining U.S. military supplies will be sold to the Chinese government.

### Soldier's Attempted Rape Failed, Two People Killed with an Axe: Major Bloodshed Case on Songhu Road, Shanghai East

[Special Report from this Newspaper] The former sports ground on Songhu Road in Shanghai East, which is the site of the receiving warehouse of the Ministry of Military and Political Affairs, suddenly saw a major human tragedy happen on the morning of the 10th. The incident was caused by a soldier whose attempted rape failed, and he killed a man and a woman with a sharp axe. The details of the incident are compiled as follows:

After the victory, the warehouse was taken over by personnel sent by our Ministry of Military and Political Affairs, and a small number of national troops were stationed there, as well as many enemy soldiers attached to it. A local child, Sun Yongbing, 12 years old, worked as a servant for the national army. He had an older sister named Guiying, 17 years old, who was not yet married. Because it was not far from home, she often went to Sun's place to visit. There was a friend named Lu Jinlan, who was with Guiying Tongkang, living at No. 3, Wanshou Street, Wan'an Bridge, Jiangwan Town. At 3 p.m. on the 9th, Guiying went to Lu's place and invited her to go out to play. They went to her brother Yongbing's place to chat. Unexpectedly, the soldier Wang Hong saw the two beauties. He suddenly had evil thoughts. At dusk, Jinlan wanted to return, and Wang designed to keep her. At about 9 o'clock, the two women slept in the same bed, and Yongbing and Wang Hong each occupied a bed. At two or three o'clock in the middle of the night, Wang got up and sneaked to the side of the two women's bed, intending to have fun. He was often rejected by the two women, and even resorted to drawing a gun to threaten them. Guiying was clever and made an excuse to go out to the toilet, leaving only Jinlan alone. Wang then threatened and seduced her, but was also rejected. He became ashamed and angry, and with a sharp axe, without asking why, he slashed her head, causing her brains to splatter and blood to flow like a fountain. She died on the spot. At that time, Yongbing was awakened from his sleep. He was extremely frightened and wanted to escape, but was dragged back by Wang. In order to silence him, he slashed his head and abdomen seven times, causing him to faint and collapse to the ground, barely breathing. Guiying heard the moaning sound outside the door and knew that a major disaster had occurred. She ran away madly. At dawn at 6 o'clock, someone discovered it and sent Yongbing to the Army Hospital for treatment, but it was ineffective and he soon died. The murderer Wang Hong has fled and is being strictly ordered to be arrested by the military, police and gendarmerie to bring him to justice and punish him.

Lu Jinlan, who was killed.

### Social Services: Advocating Safety Movement

—Xia Zhixing

After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, as gasoline could be used freely, the number of cars increased day by day. In addition, there were also Allied jeeps and trams running all day long, making the roads very lively. However, incidents of cars causing trouble have gradually increased, so it is necessary to advocate a safety movement. The safety movement must be a cooperation between the city and the Allied authorities and the citizens of the city in order to achieve effective results.

(A) Matters that the authorities should pay attention to (1) Prohibit cars from driving at extremely fast speeds on the road, and limit the fastest speed of cars to a certain degree. (2) Traffic police should be stationed at each road intersection to maintain traffic. (3) Quickly delineate appropriate boundaries on busy roads, with cars following the car boundaries, and rickshaws and pedicabs also following the boundaries, and so on, without crossing the boundaries (especially after vehicles are changed to right-hand traffic next year). (4) Crack down on vehicles driving on the road without a license. (5) Vehicles cannot be without lights or one-eyed lights at night.

(B) Matters that the Allies should pay attention to (1) Prohibit subordinates from riding jeeps to and from entertainment venues and bars, so as to avoid accidents due to drunk driving. (2) Send more military police to patrol the roads. (3) Crack down on extremely high speeds and prohibit chasing other vehicles. (If the above cannot be implemented by the Allies, it must be negotiated by our side).

(C) Matters that citizens should pay attention to (1) When walking, you should always be careful and walk on the sidewalk. (2) When crossing the road, you must pay attention to vehicles on both sides. (3) When getting off the tram, you must always pay attention to vehicles. (4) When trams are crowded, you must not climb on the tram to travel.

Finally, I hope that the safety movement will be promoted forever.

Chun Qiu (Spring and Autumn)

### Lantern Festival

—Zhu Manhua

It was a few days after the victory. I was in a small village by the Xin'an River, which is also my home. This small village has only hundreds of families, and almost all of them are farmers. At that time, the rice was almost harvested, and only a few inches of rice roots were left in the rice fields, decorating the cracked fields in squares.

The green air of the corn stalks wafted in the air, and the young "pearl rice" could already be picked and eaten. The village was quiet. The news of the victory excited everyone. The new Chinese warriors in training were particularly active. They sang, performed plays, carried water, cleaned up, and the straw piles on the muddy ground were also piled aside. At night, they chatted with the old folks. Many news stories were brought to the countryside by them. From their mouths, we learned that there would soon be a grand lantern festival in Tunxi.

It is fifty miles from here to Tunxi, but to take a car to the city, you have to travel twenty miles first. Taking a boat is an "upstream boat," which may take a whole day, so it is better not to watch it. The old and young people in the village are not disappointed, because they then learned that Zhujia Village would also be holding a lantern festival. Zhujia Village is a small town, and is a necessary water terminal to get to Tunxi. Even better, it is only three miles away from our village.

After waiting for a few days, the lantern festival in Zhujia Village was held. That night, we ate dinner early. I went with two civil servants from the court (the only decoration in this small village). The children could not walk because of their rotten feet, and they were not blessed to see it. The lantern procession was very long, about half a mile. The stores were all decorated with paper lanterns. Two of the stores with more fire had octagonal glass lanterns. The children cheered, jumped, and the adults set off firecrackers. The "big drums" and "small drums" were mixed together, and even talking could not be heard. The most eye-catching lanterns were the paper B-29 type aircraft and the huge warship, as well as the "ground play—Eight Immortals Crossing the Sea" played by children, but there were no "platforms" and Gao Xiao. Some people seemed very disappointed, but the Bodhisattva was finally carried out. The people who watched were excited again. Why is there a Bodhisattva in the lantern festival? The sedan chair had four characters written on it: "People are happy and gods are happy." It is thought that the Bodhisattva also came to participate in the grand event.

"When will we have real B-29s and huge warships?" the civil servant asked with emotion. I smiled and went home. The children were not asleep yet. They were waiting for me to tell them what I had seen. I told them that I saw a B-29 type, and many, many others...

### The Clock That Strikes in the Heart: The Beauty of Love

— Zhao Qingge

Preface to the Shanghai Edition of "This Enduring Regret"

"This Enduring Regret" is the first book I've published since returning to Shanghai. I remember that the several novels I had published in Shanghai ten years ago have all disappeared because of the war. Now, I hope, and also fear, that my books will not suffer destruction again for the same reason!

This play is adapted from the novel "Wuthering Heights" by the English female writer Emily Brontë (Imerey. Bronte). In terms of structure, I have referred to the Hollywood movie "The Clock That Strikes in the Heart" based on "Wuthering Heights." However, to adapt it to the times and the Chinese environment, the theme has been slightly infused with national consciousness, and the background has also been changed to northern China.

The story of "Wuthering Heights" is a natural tragic material. I have read the novel three times and watched the movie four times. Every time I read it, every time I watch it, I am deeply moved! Ms. Brontë only succeeded with this one novel, and this masterpiece sensationally stirred the British literary scene a century ago! This is a very tortuous novel, full of melancholy atmosphere, and with a hint of mystery. Ms. Brontë boldly depicts the development of primitive human nature, which some people may find unconventional, but I agree with it. Therefore, in this play, I have also fully expressed this unique style. Ms. Brontë analyzes subtle psychological changes in humans with delicate strokes, while at the same time she strongly and nakedly elucidates a philosophy of love that respects sentiment and is purely aesthetic. On the other hand, she also highlights the cultural trends of the time in England, as well as the "foggy" state of British society.

Due to the greatness of the literary value of this masterpiece itself, Hollywood has adapted it into a movie; I have dared to adapt it into a stage play despite my superficiality.

In order to preserve the mood of the original work as much as possible, this play may seem a bit too literary to the performers, but I have also carefully considered the conditions of the stage at all times. This is my consistent attitude when writing plays. I always hope that my scripts can not only be performed, but also read; I never want them to only be performed and not read. Or perhaps sometimes I am too biased towards the "reading" aspect—that is, the literary atmosphere is too strong, which is criticized as being too gentle; or even too cold, and therefore not suitable for the taste of the performers. However, I always feel that while the stage effect of the performance is important, the author's literary value of the script itself cannot be ignored.

I started writing this play more than three years ago. At that time, I lived in Beibei Town, near Chongqing. For the sake of caution, it took me almost seven months from conception, framing, to drafting and completion. During this period, I was helped by Mr. Liang Shiqiu, the translator of "Wuthering Heights," who gave me many valuable opinions. After the Chongqing edition was published two years ago, various cities in the mainland have been staging performances one after another. I myself have seen two performances. One was the performance of the Chongqing National Opera School (directed by Mr. Li Puyuan), and the other was the performance of the Chongqing Cement Company. I heard that during the Cement Company's performance, a real tragedy occurred—the company manager's daughter, young and beautiful, was temporarily blinded by her emotions due to unrequited love, and committed suicide after watching this play! Therefore, a friend came to accuse me and said: "No matter what the reason for her suicide, at least 'This Enduring Regret' has increased her sadness about life and fueled her determination to seek death." Rationally, I absolutely cannot admit any responsibility; but emotionally, it caused me considerable unease! I have repeatedly reflected on whether I have exaggerated the supremacy of love in this play, or even encouraged suicide? No, I absolutely do not mean that! I am just faithfully expressing Ms. Brontë's philosophy of love, which is both aesthetically beautiful and respectful towards humanity. I hope that readers and audiences can understand it deeply when they watch this play again.

Life and love are like art; art is aesthetic, and love naturally should not deviate from aesthetics. When emotions are focused, they reach a purely aesthetic realm. Many tragic materials caused by "aesthetics" are the true and good expressions of human nature! The opposite of this truth and goodness hides the source of infinite hatred; "hatred" comes from "love," and without hatred, there is no love; therefore, hatred can also be said to be a symbol of aesthetics. This aesthetic symbol has negative and positive aspects. The negative aspect is sacrifice; the positive aspect is transcendence. In "Wuthering Heights," Ms. Brontë describes two generations in two stages; the previous generation passively sacrificed with pain because they could not fight against the evil forces of objective reality. The latter generation resolutely resisted the evil forces and actively gained transcendence from pain. This is an outlet revealed by Ms. Brontë's aesthetic philosophy of love. "This Enduring Regret" is also written based on this principle. The melancholy death of the protagonist Xin Yishan in the play; and the madness of the male protagonist An Kefu in revenge; precisely demonstrate their negative aesthetic symbols; Bai Sha's rebellion and escape, shows that she can transcend the emotional constraints of pain and complete the positive aesthetic symbol.

Love can certainly drive people to suicide; but it can also teach people to save themselves! As long as you can grasp reason and are good at using aesthetic emotions.

Taking advantage of the Shanghai edition, I re-preface this play to state the essentials.

On a cold night in Shanghai, December 2, 1945.

Boundless affection for the rivers and mountains!

### Old Wine in New Bottles

— Wu Renzhi

Since old bottles are good for holding new wine, I think new bottles might as well hold old wine. Whether it fits or not is another matter.

In Mencius' "King Hui of Liang," it is said: "King Hui of Liang said, 'I have devoted my mind and strength to the country. … Examining the politics of neighboring countries, none is as attentive as I am. The people of neighboring countries do not decrease, and the people of my country do not increase. Why?'" Mencius was quite capable of speaking from the people's standpoint at the time, and King Hui of Liang was able to call him "elder" and meet with him, and ask him about the way to win the people. In modern terms, he can be said to be a relatively enlightened king, or a relatively progressive king. If King Hui of Liang were born in modern times, I think he would not dare to call himself king, but he would definitely form his own faction. Therefore, his question would inevitably be changed by a few words. As I see it, he would say, "Our faction has devoted its heart to the country. … Examining the politics of other factions, none is as attentive as I am. The people of other factions do not decrease, and the people of our faction do not increase. Why?" Then Mencius' answer would also have to be changed by one word, and say: "Providing for the living and seeing to the dead without regret is the beginning of the way of the faction." Factions also have ways. Look at the words Mencius extended, they are truly reasonable. It is also only necessary to change a name that is out of date—the word "king." I think if they were not friends, then perhaps they would never have been willing to give such unsophisticated answers in modern times, so let's replace it with "Your Excellency" as an apologetic term. Therefore, Mencius' words: "Now you control the people's property, so that their income is not enough to support their parents, and not enough to raise their wives and children. In good years, they suffer all their lives, and in bad years, they cannot escape death. They are only concerned with saving the dying and fear that they will not be able to provide enough. How can they have time to govern rites and righteousness? If Your Excellency wants to implement them, then why not return to the root?"

"Bottle" is the form, "wine" is the content. The above is about adding old content to a new form, which is just to prepare for "old wine in new bottles."

### "Sun Notes" Rumors Abound; Gold Notes Suddenly Rebound

Commodity Prices Remain Soft

The gold market yesterday continued the momentum of the previous closing. Selling pressure remained strong, and it broke through the 600,000 mark, reaching a low of 585,000. Banks continued to absorb, and the downward trend was supported. The US dollar changed from weak to stable, and then gradually became popular. People's confidence gradually returned. At the same time, the long-shelved Sun Notes became a research issue again, gradually becoming firm and firm, and returned to the 600,000 mark. Silver shops absorbed a large amount, and the chips suddenly became exhausted. By noon, it had risen to over 650,000. The afternoon was even more exciting. The money market was loose and flooded, and those with funds rushed to buy. The shorts had become exhausted, and urgently chased after them, pushing the price up to around 680,000. As a result, it rebounded 68,000 compared to the previous closing, and the trend was extremely firm. In fact, various banks have been absorbing continuously for days, and those with funds have kept them for their own use because the interest rate was too low. Most of the floating shorts were killed, and most of the chips flowed into the hands of strong parties, making it easier to react. Silver jewelry in silver shops also rose to 73,000. The price of silver for rice remained at 600 yuan. Silver dollars also hovered between 420 and 430. Due to the fatigue of the interest rate for several days, retail investors were still wary and did not see it very firm. Yesterday, it was about 8% to 11%.

Foreign currencies suddenly became popular after being weak yesterday. People's confidence reacted very strongly. The reason is that the rumors of listing prices have been continuous for many days, and various speculations have not been proven by facts. Moreover, the issue of Sun Notes is fundamentally beneficial to buyers. At the same time, the Bank of China's temporary payment of 1,000 yuan in legal tender for export bills has not changed. Once suspected, the situation immediately changed. It gradually improved from the lowest price of 940 yuan to 1,080 yuan, and the asking price even approached 1,100 yuan. As a result, it rose more than 100 yuan compared to the previous closing. The Hong Kong dollar opened low at first. Old goods were quoted at 190 yuan, and new goods at 50 yuan. There was still supply. Later, it was learned from the Guangdong group that new goods in Hong Kong had been priced at more than 40% of the original price. Based on the price of 200 yuan for old goods in Shanghai, new goods were also worth more than 80 yuan. At the same time, shipping personnel also proved that the statement was absolutely reliable. Since Hong Kong and Shanghai had opened to traffic, buyers began to actively engage in activities. Under the competition for purchase, it rose by more than 10 yuan. Old goods were also brought up. As a result, old goods rose 20 yuan compared to the previous closing, and new goods rose 11 yuan.

Public bonds struggled below the previous closing price at the beginning. Since the newspaper published rumors about Sun Notes, people in the industry brought up old matters. Once speculated, buying sentiment was stimulated, and large investors pushed the wave and chased after it. There was a slight rotation in the middle, but the result finally closed at a high price, rising from 35 yuan to 55 yuan compared to the previous closing. However, some floating shorts sold after closing.

Stocks. Chinese stocks were still weak at first. Later, the sharp reversal of gold prices and the US dollar stimulated people in the industry. As a result, large stocks rose slightly less than 10% compared to the previous closing, and small stocks rose from 10% to 15%. However, unpopular stocks were still inferior, and some even fell. Foreign stocks also followed the general trend, first low and then high, and the situation was stable. Among the small stocks, Paper Glory gradually approached Yipi. As a result, there was a slight improvement compared to the previous closing. Unpopular stocks were still supplied without demand.

Rice. The rice market opened sharply lower yesterday morning. The store side took the opportunity to pick it up at the close, and it turned slightly stronger, still down 300 to 400 yuan compared to yesterday. Flour prices unanimously fell by 300 to 400 yuan because US wheat has been made into flour by Fufeng Fuxin on a commission basis, and a part of it will be supplied to this city for sale at parity prices. The volume of transactions was extremely scarce. The oil market is still continuing in terms of source, and the factory is also responding to the market. The selling price continued to decrease by 1,000 yuan, and soybeans decreased by 1,000 yuan. Soybean cakes followed suit and decreased by 300 yuan.

Yarn market. Because the prices have fallen quite a lot for several days, the gold price has been stable in the morning, so the fingers of various customer groups moved greatly, and the purchasing was quite strong. In the afternoon, the gold price continued to rise, so the yarn and thread rose another point, with each rise of 10,000 to 20,000 in the morning and afternoon. People's hearts have returned, and the trend is looking strong.

Coal market. The downward trend is difficult to reverse, and it is still dominated by the selling trend. Market prices have continued to fall sharply. In particular, high-end goods such as white coal blocks, etc., which had previously risen too much due to the exhaustion of inventory, have recently heard that the source is promising, so the holders panicked and competed to sell, and the rebound and fall were also relatively large. The source of firewood and charcoal is abundant, and the demand is weak, and market prices continue to fall.
