### National Army Continues Advance Towards Shenyang, Right Flank Turns East Towards Yingkou

[United Press Chongqing, 27th] Reports state that the National Army advancing along the Beining Railway continued its advance today, moving 120 li from Jinzhou, reaching Goubangzi, less than 270 li from Shenyang. Unconfirmed reports suggest that the Soviet Union has agreed to hand over defense of the Northeast to the National Army, but the withdrawal date of the Soviet troops will be delayed until January of next year. It is rumored that the Soviet Union has taken responsibility for guaranteeing the safety of National Army troops airlifted to Fuyu or Changchun, where Communist forces are currently very active. It is said that the Soviet concession is due to improved relations between the two countries, and unconfirmed reports state that the Soviet Union has expressed its willingness to adhere to the spirit of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship. Chinese officials continue to state that many lower-level officials returning from Guannei to Changchun to take over the Northeast. Jiang Jingguo, the special commissioner of the Northeast will also promptly return to Changchun to negotiate with the Soviet side regarding the airlift of National Army troops to the Northeast.

[United Press, Nanjing, 27th] According to sources here today, the Central Army advancing along the Beining Railway towards Shenyang is currently facing resistance from the puppet Manchukuo army under Bao Wen-yue and various other units. Bao is the Chief of the General Staff of the Nanjing puppet military council. One month before the Japanese surrender, Bao was appointed as the chairman of the puppet Henan provincial government by Chen Gongbo. After Tokyo accepted the Potsdam Declaration, Bao rushed to the Northeast to gather the remnants of the Manchukuo army. Several old warlords of Manchuria have colluded with him, chanting "Manchuria for Manchurians," preventing the National Army from entering the nine eastern provinces, attempting to evade the crime of collaboration, and to maintain their military power in their former provinces. Jinzhou, a key point held by the Communist forces, was previously reported to have been garrisoned by the 2nd Armored Division of the Eighth Route Army under Zhu De, but after three hours of fighting, it was captured by the National Army. As the main force of the National Army rapidly advanced to Goubangzi, its right flank turned east to advance towards Yingkou. After the National Army occupies this Yellow Sea port, it will gain another landing point for maritime reinforcements. Yingkou is also a railway hub.

### National Army Around Beiping Approaches Key Passes of the Great Wall

[United Press, Chongqing, 27th] It is rumored that General Malinovsky has proposed to postpone the Soviet troop withdrawal date to January 3rd of next year in order to assist the National Army in taking over the areas occupied by the Soviet troops. It is also learned that the troops under Du Yuming, commander of the Northeast Security Command, seemed to be clearing out Communist forces around Jinzhou and Huludao today in preparation for an attack on Shenyang. It is rumored that there are only a few thousand Communist troops in Shenyang.

Responsible parties stated that Malinovsky did not provide assistance to the National Army in peacefully taking over the areas occupied by the Communist army. The National Army is currently strengthening its position in the southern part of the Nine Eastern Provinces, and it is reported that Huludao will soon replace Qinhuangdao as the main stronghold of the National Army. The National Army around Beiping is advancing towards the Gubeikou pass of the Great Wall to the northeast, with its ultimate goal being Chengde in Rehe, in order to further occupy the Rehe plateau area and to protect the National Army's deep penetration into the southern plains of the Nine Eastern Provinces.

### First Meeting of the Supreme Economic Council, President Song Proposes Three Principles

Realizing Economic Construction Policies with a Spirit of Great Fearlessness

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 27th] At the first meeting of the Supreme Economic Council on the 26th, President Song delivered a speech, the full text of which is as follows: "Chairman, esteemed members, distinguished guests, today marks the establishment of this council. We are deeply inspired by the Chairman's presence and his insightful instructions on the direction of our policy implementation. As this council is the highest decision-making body for economic policy, it bears a very close relationship with the national economy and the people's livelihoods, and its responsibilities are truly immense. We are now facing countless difficulties, which pose tremendous obstacles to any economic construction policy. We must embrace a spirit of great fearlessness to overcome these difficulties, so that economic construction policies can be thoroughly implemented. As the Chairman indicated in his speech, when the basic conditions are suitably resolved, the prosperity of our national economy can enter a stage never before reached. As for when this stage can be reached, we must first recognize that not only must government officials work hard and the environment be improved rapidly, but also the economic plans adopted in the future must be suitable for our national conditions and not violate economic principles. Therefore, before deciding on a plan, it must be thoroughly studied. Before implementing the plan, there must be particularly careful preparation. Today, as this council is established, we should put forward a few simple and essential principles, that is, the principles that the government must adhere to when implementing economic policies, with respect to the people, the government itself, and friendly nations, as follows:"

### Regarding the People: Supporting Economic Activities

"First, with respect to the people, the government should guide the economic endeavors of the people so that they can develop vigorously, not to control these endeavors, but to support the economic activities of the people so that they can proceed smoothly, not to interfere with these activities. However, there are considerable limits to guidance and support. It is not to say that the people can take a completely dependent attitude towards the government. Rather, in economic matters, the people must not forget the fundamental principle of 'self-reliance.' Whether it is industry, commerce, finance, or agriculture, regardless of the scale, they must use their own strength and courage to succeed. The success of all the people's endeavors, as long as they do not exceed the scope of the government's economic policies, is fulfilling a part of the responsibility to the nation, to society, and to the national economy. However, if the people do not strive forward from the starting point of 'self-help,' believing that the government can continuously sacrifice the national treasury to maintain a situation that cannot be sustained on an economic level, this is a grave error."

Four Important Areas

"As for the concrete manifestations of government guidance and support, they are not in providing funds, but in the following four important areas:

A. Regarding technology, the government, because of its position and its concentrated power, is more likely than the people to obtain the latest and most advanced scientific knowledge at home and abroad, and to attract first-class technical talents. In the future, appropriate institutions should be established in many ways to serve as the core for guiding agricultural, industrial, and commercial experiments and improvements.

B. Regarding finance, the government currently faces a pressing issue, which is how to reorganize finances and stabilize finance. Being able to solve this problem is the most fundamental assistance to the people's economy. Because prices and finance cannot be stabilized, all production enterprises will not dare to move forward boldly, and the labor problem will not be able to find a long-term solution. High interest rates cannot fall, and production is difficult to be vigorous. Therefore, the government must start by stabilizing finance to support the people's economy.

C. The most attention should be paid to transportation, for reasons that are very clear. Currently, the major obstacle to the recovery of agriculture, industry, and commerce is the extensive damage to transportation equipment and the obstruction of transportation in various places after the long war of resistance. The most effective way for the government to support the economic development of the people is to actively restore the main railway lines, the Yangtze River and coastal shipping lines, important inland highways, and further, to complete air transport between major cities.

D. Regarding power, an indispensable condition for modern production mechanization is the availability of inexpensive power. Therefore, the government should first pay attention to the production of coal and the distribution of various coal-producing areas in order to support the economic development of the people. When industrial development reaches a considerable stage in the future, and the middle reaches of the Yangtze River can reach a level suitable for economic conditions, the government should not hesitate to invest huge capital to develop large-scale hydropower generation projects, and should first make various technical preparations. The above four items are only examples of the most important principles of the government's economic policy towards the people. However, the obligations that the government should fulfill for the economic development of the people and the assistance that the people should expect from the government have been briefly outlined."

### Regarding the Government Itself: Balancing Economic Policies

"Second, regarding the government itself, this council has the responsibility of balancing and adjusting the economic policies of various government departments. The so-called balancing refers to maintaining a balance between the government and the people in the distribution of the nation's annual production for productive enterprises. The first point is that because the annual production income of a country is limited, if the portion consumed by the government is too large, the result will naturally be that the people's productivity will be hit. Therefore, the government must limit the scope of its own expenditures to avoid over-consuming the nation's production income, so as not to lose its balance. The second point is that the enterprises operated by the government must have sufficient reasons for being state-owned. Otherwise, the result will not only increase unnecessary burdens on the national treasury, but also threaten the stability of finance, and the distribution of productive enterprises between the government and the people will also be unbalanced. The meaning of the so-called balance is not to say that the two parties should be evenly distributed, but a reasonable distribution of importance. The so-called adjustment refers to adjusting the enterprises run by various government departments if there are overlaps. If there are contradictions in the economic policies promoted by various departments, they must also be adjusted. Therefore, it has the responsibility of overall planning for the government's own expenditures and the enterprises it operates, as well as the policies it promotes."

### Regarding Friendly Nations: Frank, Mutually Beneficial Cooperation

"Third, regarding friendly nations, the government should take cooperation as the premise in its economic relations with various friendly nations. The approach should be absolutely frank and mutually beneficial, and without any bias. The scope can be roughly divided into technical cooperation, cooperation in operational matters, and financial cooperation. In terms of technology, this council should lead and maintain mutually beneficial contact with countries advanced in engineering and science, so as to increase the speed of economic development for the people and various government departments. In terms of commerce, efforts should be made to achieve mutually beneficial coordination in all matters relating to international trade and international exchange. In terms of finance, efforts should be made to cooperate with friendly nations to enable capital seeking outlets on the one hand to flow in accordance with economic conditions, and on the other hand, to reasonably utilize it to increase domestic production capacity. The above three types of international economic cooperation can directly or indirectly help and advance the realization of the prosperity of our national economy. The above is a very brief outline of the goals to be pursued by this council in the future. It is hoped that under the leadership of the Chairman, we will proceed in a down-to-earth and prudent manner, and that the members will provide more assistance to the heavy and complex economic planning in the future."

### US Ambassador to China, Hurley, Resigns

[Central News Agency, Washington, 27th] US Ambassador to China Hurley has resigned. He believes that the failure of US Asian policy is due to the weakness and opposition of US diplomatic authorities.

### Xiong Shouxing and Hu Zhi Appointed as Members of the Jiangxi Provincial Government

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 27th] The National Government issued an order on the 27th: Wen Qun, member of the Jiangxi Provincial Government and Director of the Department of Finance, and Hu Jiafeng, member and Secretary-General, have requested to resign. Wen Qun and Hu Jiafeng are both approved to be relieved of their respective concurrent posts. In this order, Xiong Shouxing and Hu Zhi are appointed as members of the Jiangxi Provincial Government. In this order, Xiong Shouxing is concurrently appointed as Director of the Department of Finance of the Jiangxi Provincial Government.

### End Date of the War of Resistance Designated as September 3rd

Wartime Regulations Simultaneously Abolished

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 27th] Many of the various wartime regulations promulgated by the National Government stipulate a period of practical application, and must be abolished after the end of the war or within a certain number of days after the end of the war. Therefore, the date of the end of the war of resistance should be clearly designated as a basis. It is heard that the National Government will designate September 3rd of this year, the day the Allied nations accepted the surrender of Tokyo, as the end date of the war of resistance.

### Political Conference to Convene on November 1st, List of Attendees Finalized

[This Newspaper, Chongqing, 27th] Zhang Qun said in a speech in Chengdu: The political conference is scheduled to open on November 1st, but based on observations here, it depends on the outcome of Zhou Enlai's return to Yan'an.

### Jiang Tingfu Scheduled to Return to Chongqing Today, Relief Work Determined to be Nationalized, Relief to be Promoted in Communist Areas Alike

[This Newspaper Report] Jiang Tingfu, Director of the China Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (CRRRA), and Han Leisheng, Deputy Director of the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA), jointly hosted a reception for the press in this city at the Cathay Hotel yesterday to report on their recent tour of the country and to explain the ways to promote relief and rehabilitation work. At the reception, the most noteworthy point was Jiang's clarification of the nationalization of the CRRRA's work. Jiang said, "Our work is aimed at the people of the whole country, without distinction of north, south, east, or west, and without distinction of party or religion, we treat everyone equally. The principle of relief is based on the degree of destruction and the extent of damage." Before leaving Chongqing, I discussed this point with Mr. Zhou Enlai. Mr. Zhou expressed his approval and agreed with him that if the safety of the CRRRA's staff and relief supplies could be guaranteed, relief and rehabilitation work would be promoted in the Communist areas at the same time.

Regarding suppressing prices, Jiang said: "One of the major goals of the CRRRA's work is to assist the government and the people in actively suppressing inflation and rising prices. A portion of the relief supplies will be sold at parity prices in various places in order to balance prices. At the same time, this method will be used to obtain funds to promote other rehabilitation construction work. The government has allocated more than 100 million yuan this year for various relief and rehabilitation expenses, and the budget for next year will be increased to 400 million yuan." Jiang is scheduled to return to Chongqing today, and Han Leisheng is also scheduled to return to the United States.

In answering questions from reporters, Jiang added: "At the request of Ms. Soong Ching Ling, the CRRRA has collected a large quantity of medical supplies in Chongqing and is preparing to transport them to the Communist areas by truck. I have told Ms. Soong that when the medicines are received, only a receipt from the hospital director is required, and there are no other conditions."

No Famine Guaranteed Within Two or Three Years

Regarding the future of relief and rehabilitation work, Jiang said: "In the end, we must rely on our own efforts. During the eight years of the War of Resistance, our country faced many difficulties and had limited capabilities. However, our government has made a firm determination to ensure that relief work can be effective. I can boldly guarantee three things: (1) The assistance that the United Nations will give me will be very great. (2) No famine can be guaranteed in China within two years. (3) No plague can be guaranteed in China within two or three years. I have always liked to study history. In the past, countries that had undergone great wars needed 30 to 40 years to recover. I hope that this time, with modern scientific methods and with the assistance of the Allied nations, our country can restore its original vigor that was lost in the war within four or five years."

Han Leisheng Reports on Work

[Central News Agency, This City Report] Before Director Jiang spoke, Han Leisheng reported, briefly stating: "(1) After arriving in China, I visited Chairman Jiang, President Song, etc., and inspected various places one after another. The impression I got was excellent. After inspecting Guilin, Liuzhou, Hankou, Tianjin, Beiping, Guangzhou, Hengyang, and other counties and villages, I felt that the most serious problems were: A, Lack of transportation; B, Insufficient distribution of coal for winter; C, The supply of medicines, hospitals, doctors, clothing, and food also needs to be resolved. (2) To remedy the above difficulties, the UNRRA has formulated working methods, and work is underway. For the work in China, we will try to transport relief supplies to China and help China solve post-war difficulties. There are already five ships transporting supplies to China, and nine to ten ships are on the way. On average, 30 relief ships can arrive in China every month, each with a load of 8,000 tons.

Transporting Goods to China and Transferring Them to the Interior

"How to transport the goods to China and transfer them to the interior needs to be thoroughly resolved. We will use airplanes, ships, trains, cars, etc. as transportation tools. A, In terms of ships, ships from the UK, the US, Canada, and Norway will all participate in this work in the future. Each ship carries a value of 4 million US dollars. B, In terms of vehicles, 600 transport vehicles have arrived in China, and 1,050 are on the way, and there will be more in the future. In addition, there are landing ships suitable for inland navigation. C, Railway transportation is the most problematic because the US military has no surplus materials to repair the destroyed railways, and vehicles are also in short supply. It is hoped that the Chinese government will find a solution to this matter quickly. (3) A large number of hospital supplies, cotton, and gauze will continue to be shipped, and clothes will be collected from the UK, the US, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand, totaling 10 million pounds (each pound is worth 11 US dollars), and are already on the way to China."

China Must Rebuild Itself

Han Leisheng concluded by saying that China has suffered greatly after eight years of the War of Resistance, and that all of its difficulties must be resolved by China itself. Foreign relief is only a kind of assistance, and China's reconstruction must be achieved through China's efforts. The UNRRA's work will end in March 1947, so the responsibility of the China Relief and Rehabilitation Administration is very heavy. He has great expectations for China's reconstruction.

### Special Commentary: On the So-Called Shidehara Diplomacy

— Zhang Shizhao

Shidehara Diplomacy is an old term in international forums, also known as Shidehara Foreign Policy. From 1924 to 1931, Shidehara served as Foreign Minister in six of Japan's seven cabinets. At that time, the country's power was growing, attracting the attention of various powers. He outwardly pretended to be skilled in neighborly relations, while secretly engaging in extensive strategic maneuvering. As a son-in-law of nobility, he occupied the important post of Foreign Minister, and after much glory, sudden adversity struck. After the September 18th Incident, he judged the reckless actions of the Kwantung Army would be greatly detrimental to the country. He declared to the public, "Japan has swallowed a bomb!" As a result, he greatly offended the military clique and was sidelined for more than ten years. After the defeat, he rose again to clean up the mess, cautiously aware of the unlucky fate of Emperor Jimmu, and hesitating at the door of the Allied commander. His final years were quite pitiful. In all fairness, this was probably compelled by his patriotic heart, and not what he desired.

The New York Evening Post criticized Shidehara with the following points: 1. The military cliques advocated armed aggression, which was rapid, while the financial cliques advocated economic aggression, which was slow. Shidehara rode in the luxurious carriage of the financial cliques and traveled on the broad road of the military cliques. The only difference was the means and tools; the crime of aggression was the same. 2. Japanese politicians like Ozaki Saito rose to prominence by opposing aggression. The Shidehara Cabinet, nominally seeking talent from across the country, in fact excluded and ignored them. Conversely, Nonazawa, the president of the Bank of Japan who supported the military cliques during the war, was frequently consulted and relied upon as a key figure. If the root of aggression is not eradicated, how can the country's governance be good? 3. The US Secretary of State and the Army and Navy have jointly declared that Japanese Shinto should be eliminated. Shinto is the source of the Emperor's power. Shidehara, with all his might, supported the Emperor system. How can the trend of Emperor worship and aggression worship be stopped? 4. Former US Ambassador to Japan, Grew, who was known as an expert on Japan, praised Shidehara diplomacy in his book written after ten years of service in Japan, attributing it to "enlightenment." However, there is a difference between enlightenment and moderation. Shidehara was certainly moderate, but not enlightened. Moderation is not constant. Economic aggression is precisely because it is gradual, causing the invaded country to decay from within without realizing it.

These four points are not only the opinion of the New York Evening Post, but also the common sentiment in China's public and private discussions. I once saw a special dispatch from Tokyo in Dongzhou Jing reporting that Shidehara told reporters about his regret for the Northeast provinces, which was extremely common, but the headline claimed that Shidehara was shirking responsibility on us, and his words were mostly absurd. Absurdity is a mild term, and even his talk with reporters, though a small matter, can be used to infer the rest. I believe that the government of a defeated country is weak and easily blamed, and its efforts to seek the sympathy of the victorious countries are driven by both emotion and necessity. If they seek sympathy but are still subjected to contempt and abuse, they will be at a loss and may even resign in dismay. This can be seen from Germany after World War I. At that time, the Berlin government had no intention of planning revenge, and sought to cooperate with the Allied powers and guide its people to democracy and freedom. However, the victorious countries constantly found fault, leading the people to hate the government for selling out the country and frequently assassinating officials. Rathenau, a scholar known for his academic achievements and peaceful temperament, was in charge of foreign affairs, but his life was not safe. The cabinet rose and fell frequently, and even when it rose, it could not enjoy a peaceful night. Soon after, Hitler seized the opportunity and took control, leading Germany into Nazism as if it were nothing. The volcano of World War II was buried here! These are all things that today's politicians have seen and should serve as a clear warning.

Japan is an enemy country, and Shidehara is an enemy prime minister. To demand that he share the same views as us, especially when he was in power ten years ago, seems unfair. Now, at the age of seventy, he is struggling to manage a difficult situation. His spirit of compromise is perhaps most suitable at this time, just like Rathenau, the man of peace and virtue. It must be known that the Japanese people who oppose Shidehara, as seen from the declarations of Tokyo newspapers and various parties, are numerous. If the Allies give them an opportunity, these people will seize it to stab Shidehara in the chest. The collapse of his cabinet will be like crushing dry weeds and rotten wood. Whoever rises again will not be able to satisfy the wishes of the Japanese opposition. Moving forward smoothly is unlikely. If they don't return to the far right, they may move to the far left, becoming radical and reckless. This is not just a杞人忧天 (groundless fear).

In recent months, the theory of the balance of power in Europe has gradually emerged again. Talented people there point to the US, China, and the Soviet Union as three systems, and plan to establish a Western European alliance to resist them. As for Japan, whose diplomacy cannot be independent for some time, which system will it join to gradually assert itself? As for Japan's affairs, we Chinese should ask ourselves whether we can become a system and what preparations we should make from now on. We cannot pretend not to know. Compatriots returning from America often say that Americans no longer talk about Pearl Harbor. It is said that such sentiments are not heard among ordinary people. This shows that the Yankees are superior. Our national strength is far inferior to that of America. If our intelligence is also so far behind, what will the result be? What should we do? It is said that since the Meiji Restoration, Japan has achieved the status of a powerful country before the war through seventy years of hard work. How easy is that? Now, a single defeat has destroyed everything. The depression and agitation in their hearts are self-evident, as is the humiliation of kneeling and begging for peace from our country, whose military strength is far inferior. Japan has always considered itself the leader of East Asia and does not treat us as equals. We cannot find a favorable diplomatic path. Now that Heaven has taken their spirit and they are paying for their sins, we should use our magnanimity to act between "virtue" and "justice" to repay them. Would they agree and follow? Would that be what we desire? Whatever the results, we will not interfere with their approach. In short, for the present, we have no time to provoke them and ignite that humiliation. Holding this to restrain the Shidehara Cabinet is more than half the solution.

### Senate Launches Heated Debate on Authorizing the President

[United Press, Washington, 27th] After the Senate began debating the authorization of Truman to dispatch US troops to join other United Nations members in sanctions against aggression, Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Connally pointed out today that the United Nations organization is a "preventive medicine" that can be used to stop the spread of war. He also observed the turmoil in the East Indies, Iran, China, Palestine, Argentina, and Spain, viewing the United Nations organization as "the only bright spot in the sky without rain." He said, "Only by maintaining the American spirit can we best contribute to world peace. For this reason, my position has always been against a world federation that would bury America."

[Associated Press, Washington, 27th] US Senators Ball, Fulbright, and Taylor proposed today that the strength of the United Nations organization might be insufficient to prevent atomic bomb warfare, and that it would be more effective to organize a world government, but this was immediately refuted by Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Connally. It is said that India has a population of 300 million, China 400 million, and the Soviet Union 175 million, far more than the United States. Once a world government is established, the United States will lag behind in population numbers. Taylor replied that he would rather be outnumbered in a world government than die in an atomic bomb attack.

### US Foreign Policy Has Always Considered China a Friend

Former Secretary of State Hull Says

[Central News Agency, Washington, 26th, United Press] Former Secretary of State Hull, in response to inquiries from members of the Congressional Pearl Harbor attack investigation committee regarding part of US foreign policy, stated that it has long been aimed at maintaining a strong China.

(3) We support international cooperation and the policy of seeking peaceful solutions to international disputes. (4) As early as 1936, we declared that aggression against one country affects all countries. We could have retired to our homes, but I do not want to recount to you today what would have happened if we had retired. Former Ambassador to Japan Grew testified that Japan severed diplomatic relations with the United States and launched a surprise attack on Pearl Harbor just as he was about to present President Roosevelt's final appeal to the Japanese Emperor.

### Terrorist Actions Occur in Seoul

### List of Japanese War Criminals Has Been Sent to MacArthur - Emperor Not Included

[United Press, Tokyo, 27th] A spokesman for MacArthur's chief of staff announced today that the list of Japanese war criminals submitted by the Chinese government has been delivered to MacArthur's headquarters.

### Gloomy Skies and Continuous Autumn Rain - Japanese Parliament Opens Yesterday - Emperor's Rescript Proclaims Proactive Axis as Usual

[Associated Press, Tokyo, 27th] The Japanese extraordinary parliament opened this morning in the magnificent House of Peers. Emperor Hirohito attended as usual and read the official rescript in a dull tone. Members of both houses of parliament bowed deeply and listened attentively as usual. To the right of the Emperor's seat were the royal princes and officials of the Imperial Household Ministry, and to their right was Prime Minister Shidehara. The first chapter of the rescript was about amending the current election law, which seemed to be limited to the House of Representatives. In addition, various existing laws that suppress the people must be abolished, and the distribution of large estates and the establishment of labor laws must be implemented one by one. This is unprecedented in Japanese history. Hirohito always wore a golden and brilliant military uniform for previous attendances, but today he changed to a newly made ceremonial dress with no smile on his face. In the silence of the entire assembly, he walked quickly to the throne. People inside the building had been waiting for ten minutes. Hirohito's brother, Prince Chichibu, did not attend, reportedly due to illness. Prince Takamatsu attended in a naval uniform with ribbons, and Prince Mikasa wore an army uniform. When the parliament opened today, the weather was gloomy and autumn rain was continuous. It is said that this is the usual pattern.

### Shidehara Cabinet Gains Breathing Room

Order to Suspend Pensions Granted Extension

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 26th] News from Japanese political circles states that the crisis faced by the Shidehara Cabinet has temporarily subsided. MacArthur originally ordered the Japanese government to immediately stop all pensions for military personnel. However, after Shidehara personally explained to MacArthur that the cabinet would face a serious crisis if the order was implemented immediately, and requested MacArthur to postpone the order until February 1 of next year, MacArthur has granted an extension. MacArthur's order will have a significantly greater impact on Japanese soldiers than previous orders. Under the pension system, retired officers of the Japanese army and navy can temporarily secure their livelihoods. If it is stopped, these soldiers will have no time or opportunity to find a way to restore their status. MacArthur's recent order to abolish all organizations of Japanese soldiers has also had a significant impact on most retired Japanese soldiers. MacArthur's policy of cracking down on wartime profiteers and military personnel who seek profit seems to be progressing well. According to Naraqiao Gu, director of the Cabinet Legislation Bureau, in a conversation today, he believes that the cabinet can overcome the difficult hurdle of the parliament convened today. After holding a simple opening ceremony this morning, the parliament will begin discussing various practical issues tomorrow.

Five Thousand Chinese in Surabaya Killed or Wounded

[Reuters, Batavia, 27th] The Indonesian National Congress convened yesterday and resolved three matters: (1) To thank Ceylon for its sympathy; (2) To thank the Ceylonese Minister of Health for asking the Ceylonese government to actively assist Indonesia; (3) To call upon the people of Ceylon and India to provide material and spiritual assistance to the Indonesian independence movement, so that the British cannot sacrifice Indonesia to the Netherlands. The Indonesian parliament believes that Britain's actions in Indonesia are similar to Japan's creation of the Mukden Incident in 1931.

[Central News Agency, Batavia, 27th, United Press] The Indonesian Parliament, meeting here yesterday, announced that the military conflict in Surabaya resulted in 55,000 Chinese deaths and injuries, and completely blamed Britain for the Java incident.

### The Relief Administration Will Allocate 800 Million Yuan to Our Country

The US Senate Passes an Appropriation for the Administration to Help Fund Its Work Next Year

[Central News Agency, New York, 26th Dispatch] The US Senate Appropriations Committee today passed an appropriation of the remaining $550 million owed to the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA). This means that the unpaid portion of the funds originally allocated by the United States to UNRRA can be fully allocated. For China, UNRRA will be able to allocate 800 million yuan in accordance with regulations. The House Foreign Affairs Committee has also passed a $1.35 billion appropriation for UNRRA, which is the funds the United States is allocating to UNRRA to help fund its work next year. Today's news: The new proposal will be submitted for debate in the House before the Christmas recess. After the bill is passed by the House, it will be submitted to the Senate for approval, followed by the allocation of funds. Although President Truman, Director Ryman, and Marshal Eisenhower have sought the immediate allocation of funds to the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, Congress has not yet approved it. Congress's indecision may be due to: (1) UNRRA's poor performance; (2) A large proportion of UNRRA's relief supplies are being shipped to the Soviet-controlled Balkan Peninsula and Eastern Europe. It is said that UNRRA officials working in the region cannot obtain free and fair reports on how materials are distributed and how work is progressing. In addition to the usual partisan political struggles, legislative disputes in Congress are also a reason for the delay.

[United Press, Washington, 26th] It is reported that any country that allows journalists to enter and report on UNRRA activities without restrictions can request UNRRA relief.

### The United States Suggests to Britain and the Soviet Union: Expedite the Withdrawal of Troops from Iran; Britain Urges the Soviet Union to Pay Attention to the Tripartite Treaty with Iran

[Reuters, Washington, 27th] The State Department revealed yesterday that the US government has suggested to the British and Soviet governments that foreign troops in Iran should be completely withdrawn by January 1 next year. The State Department's note to Moscow on November 24 stated that the US government has instructed the US military authorities in Iran to immediately begin preparations to ensure the complete withdrawal of US troops from Iran by January 1. The note mentioned the Tehran Declaration of 1943 regarding Iran's independent sovereignty and territorial integrity, and stated that in view of the developments there, the US government believes that British, American, and Soviet troops should be withdrawn from Iran immediately, because the continued presence of troops in Iran inevitably leads to disputes and misunderstandings. The US government's note continued that the Iranian government has the freedom to move its troops to any part of the country. The US government is well aware that the Soviet military commander in the area may be preventing the Iranian army from acting freely, but such measures have not been approved by the Soviet government. If the Soviet military commander is acting without the order of his government, it is thought that the Soviet government should have ordered him to respect the aforementioned declaration. The Anglo-Soviet-Iranian Treaty of 1942 stipulates that foreign troops must withdraw from Iran within six months after the end of the war against Germany and its allies. Therefore, counting from the date of Japan's surrender, foreign troops should withdraw from Iran by March 2 next year.

[Reuters, London, 27th] British Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Sir Archibald Clark Kerr, has presented a note to Soviet People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Molotov regarding the events in Iran, asking him to pay attention to the provisions of the Anglo-Soviet-Iranian Treaty of 1942 and the contents of the Tehran Declaration of December 1943, and stating that the actions of the Soviet military commander in the area may be due to a misunderstanding.

County Government Establishes Rent Collection Office

Therefore, when passing through the county, they surrendered to county and district-level agencies one after another. According to a reporter's investigation, a total of 44 people have returned. After considering the circumstances, 11 people were given travel expenses to return to their hometowns. The remaining 33 people, including Liu Zixiang, were escorted to Hangzhou by Zheng, the platoon leader of the Second Self-Defense Brigade of this county, on the morning of the 24th of this month, and transferred to the provincial government for rehabilitation.

### Morning Friends Basketball Match: Two Grade A Matches Today; Green Forest vs. Overseas Chinese

Desheng vs. V Team

There will be two Grade A matches as usual in the Morning Friends Basketball League today, and one additional friendly match. Tickets are priced at 100 yuan.

The first match is Green Forest vs. Overseas Chinese. Green Forest has the guidance of Qian Xucang and follows the rules, making significant progress. Whether in offense or defense, they are methodical. It is a pity that they still lack a key to scoring, otherwise their record could be more satisfactory. In today's match against Overseas Chinese, they should be able to win.

The second match is Desheng vs. the V Team. Desheng is composed of veteran players who are experienced, but their stamina is lacking. The V Team is composed of rising stars who are energetic, but they have difficulty staying calm in battle. Therefore, the two teams have their own advantages and disadvantages. Once they meet, a fierce battle is inevitable. An additional interlude is the Hualian vs. US Military Police match.

### An Outline of India's International University

— By Leda Guan

A few days ago, newspapers reported that Mr. Tan Yunshan, the Dean of the Chinese Academy of India's International University, had an audience with Chairman Chiang in the temporary capital. I imagine that the name "International University" might not be very familiar to the average person!

The International University was founded in 1902 by the father of the Indian poet laureate Tagore (Dr. Ralindranth Tagore), and it has a history of over 40 years.

Taking a train from Calcutta's Montra Station for several hours, you reach Bolpar, and after walking for another one or two hours, the International University comes into view. Its original location is in Santiniketan, a place near the small town of Bolpar in Bengal, India. It was originally a desolate, barren land, infested with bandits. The "Poet Laureate's" parents prayed silently day and night. Later, a bandit was moved by Tagore's parents and turned from evil to good, and this place became an academic center filled with the sounds of music and learning.

In 1913, the "Poet Laureate" received the Nobel Prize in Literature from the Swedish Academy, and he used all the prize money as funding to run the university. In 1920, after the First World War, Tagore returned home from his travels in Europe and officially named it the International University, melting Eastern and Western cultures into one.

The International University has a fairly large organization. Its established departments can be divided into the following categories:

(1) Middle School Department, divided into junior and senior levels.

(2) University Department, divided into upper and lower terms, to be completed in four years.

(3) Research Institute, offering courses in philosophy, literature, art, Sanskrit, and other national literatures.

In addition, there are women's colleges and vocational colleges, with subjects such as local industry, planting, weaving, and animal husbandry.

As for the faculty, in addition to a few Europeans and Americans and famous Indian scholars, there is also Mr. Tan Yunshan, who left his motherland and went to the distant foreign land of India to work hard to promote communication between Chinese and Indian cultures. He is now the Dean of the Chinese Academy. However, there are not many Chinese students studying there. The school buildings, only the art school and the library, are relatively modernized, while the rest are bamboo fences and thatched huts. Students often freely attend classes outdoors, immersed in nature, living a peaceful and simple life.

Looking back at history, Indian Buddhist scriptures and literature have had a great influence on China, not only in religion but also in culture. We hope that the International University can once again bring about a great exchange of Chinese and Indian cultures!

### Committee for Reviewing Enemy and Puppet Industries to Sell Sugar at Affordable Prices

Yesterday, the Shanghai District Committee for Reviewing Enemy and Puppet Industries held its 13th meeting to discuss proposals, among which the disposal of received materials attracted the most attention from the general public. It was decided to sell sugar stored in various received warehouses at affordable prices, referring to past experience in affordable sales, and directly supply it to the market. It is said that the detailed implementation measures are being rushed out and should be realized soon. It is also reported that the Executive Yuan's office in Shanghai will transport a large amount of Taiwan sugar to Shanghai from Taiwan and will also sell it at affordable prices together. In addition, the bureau has received a large amount of fish, meat, and eggs stored in various cold storage facilities. It is said that the Review Committee has also decided in principle to sell them at affordable prices. Once the detailed measures are determined, the sales can begin. Recently, there has been a great need for various types of paper on the market, and paper mills are eagerly rushing to produce it. In view of this, the committee has decided to put forward all the wood pulp and other papermaking raw materials stored in various received warehouses to supply to the paper mills.

### Tax Authorities Should Accept Puppet Reserve Certificates

The Finance and Monetary Affairs Special Envoy Office announced: "Regarding the pricing and limited-time redemption of puppet Central Reserve Certificates, before the redemption deadline, national banks and bureaus can accept and pay puppet Central Reserve Certificates at the set price. If too much is accumulated, they are allowed to exchange them for legal currency at the national bank. Tax authorities can also accept puppet Central Reserve Certificates at the set price and hand them over to the national bank for transfer and deposit, but they must be recorded in legal currency."

### High Court Opens Investigation Hearing; Continues Hearing of Traitor Case; Chu Used His Land to Aid the Enemy

Yesterday, the Shanghai High Court opened an investigation hearing to try a traitor. The presiding judge was Liu Yugui, acting director of the Criminal Division. The defendant's name was Chu Jiutian, 40 years old, from Shanghai, residing at No. 30, Shangyifang, Route Ghisi. The case originated in 1940 when Kong Xianxiong, a special commissioner of the Central Executive Committee of the Northeast, and Sun Lingao, an inspector, went to the Northeast via Shanghai. At that time, Chu colluded with Qian and Liu to report to No. 76, Route Ghisi, resulting in their detention. It was not until the recovery of Shanghai that Kong and Sun learned of Chu's whereabouts on September 29th and sent him to the Taishan Road Police Station. After the prosecutor's office completed the investigation, a public prosecution was filed according to law. Yesterday, the defendant vehemently denied the charges in court. The court adjourned the hearing and summoned Kong and Sun to testify again. Bail was denied, and he was returned to custody.

### Main Streets of This City to be Renamed Next Month

(2) The total roads in the city will be divided into several main lines, named after Zhongzheng, Zhongshan, Linsen, Heping, Jianguo, etc. The roads currently decided to be renamed are: (1) Avenue Joffre will be renamed Linsen Road. (2) Route Lafayette will be renamed Heping Road. (3) Route Comte will be renamed Jianguo Road. (4) Avenue de Mentigny will be renamed South Tibet Road. (5) Bubbling Well Road will be renamed West Nanjing Road. (6) Avenue Road will be renamed West Beijing Road. (7) The Bund from Waibaidu Bridge on Huangpu Road to Limalu on South Huangpu Road will be renamed Zhongshan Road. As for the original Zhongshan Road and Heping Road in Nanshi, they will also be renamed.

### Mei Lanfang to Perform Again

Dr. Mei Lanfang, who has been off the stage for eight years, was invited by the municipal government to perform at the Lyceum Theatre to celebrate Shanghai's anniversary after the victory. People in Shanghai regretted that they could not hear his long-silent voice. It is now learned that Mei will publicly perform at the Majestic Theatre starting today (the 28th). The plays for the first two days are "Assassinating the Tiger" and for the third and fourth days are "The Peony Pavilion."

### Urging Merchants to Value Ethics

Since the soaring prices in this city have affected people's livelihoods, Chairman Chiang has been concerned about the hardships of the people. He previously sent a special telegram to Mr. Du Yuesheng, chairman of the local association in this city, asking him to unite with respected people from all walks of life to express their opinions and work together to find ways to stabilize prices. The industrial and commercial circles of this city, upon hearing this news, all admired the Chairman's virtue and worked hard to stabilize prices. As a result, speculative activities have gradually subsided in recent days, and the prices of daily necessities have also successively fallen by 5% to 30%. This shows the sincerity and enthusiasm of the citizens of this city in supporting the supreme leader. However, there are still some unscrupulous merchants who do not understand the overall situation and deliberately charge high prices when Allied forces purchase goods or patronize restaurants, hotels, and entertainment venues, in order to seek undue profits, which has aroused the dissatisfaction of the Allied authorities.

Du Yuesheng Speaks

Chairman Du believes that this kind of situation is inappropriate. Yesterday, he told reporters: The Allied military and civilians who have come to Shanghai this time are all our comrades-in-arms who have fought side by side with us and shared our hardships. When they patronize restaurants, hotels, and entertainment venues and purchase daily necessities, we should provide genuine goods at fair prices and be especially self-restrained in order to show our preferential treatment to our allies, and we can also use this to establish credit and develop international trade. If someone is ignorant of the overall situation and greedy for immediate profits, Allied personnel will have a bad impression, which is detrimental to all citizens. It is hoped that the media will condemn them and not be lenient, and that all industries and businesses will encourage each other to respect commercial ethics and revive good customs, in accordance with Chairman Chiang's intention to protect friendly nations and treat the Allied forces preferentially, and follow Mayor Qian's advice. The Local Association is willing to share the mission of advocating justice with the media.

Wang Xiaolai Speaks

Wang Xiaolai, Chairman of the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, also issued a statement yesterday: Honesty and trustworthiness in business are our country's inherent reputation, which must be diligently maintained. Moreover, how should we treat the Allied soldiers who fought side by side with us with sincere friendship, give them special preferential treatment and guidance, so as to show the sincerity of our compatriots, directly maintain our commercial reputation, and indirectly enhance our country's position? All local citizens and business colleagues should pay attention to this.

### Mayor Qian and Service Corps Leaders Hold Reception for Allied Forces; Hope Compatriots will Assist in the Work of Receiving Allied Forces

Mayor Qian Dajun, Bai Qiju, head of the Military Commission's Battlefield Service Corps, and Lu Meiseng, head of the Allied Forces Service Agency, held a reception for the Allied Forces at the Kang Le Restaurant on Jing'an Temple Road at 7:30 last night. General Wedemeyer and dozens of senior Allied officers attended, with a total of more than 200 guests. At the dinner, Mayor Qian gave a speech, saying that the Allied forces stationed in Shanghai are brave soldiers who have fought side by side with the National Army for many years and have suffered the hardships of traveling over mountains and rivers under the leadership of Chairman Chiang and General Wedemeyer. We Shanghai citizens should do our best as hosts, and we must fully express our sincerity in respecting guests in all aspects. In particular, our stores must not have the slightest hypocrisy. I hope that all of you present here, as well as the five million compatriots in the city, will assist the work of the Shanghai Joint Committee for Serving the Allied Forces. At the same time, we welcome all Allied soldiers to participate in and guide the various activities of this Shanghai public organization. After Qian's speech, General Wedemeyer took the stage and thanked everyone for the comforting event, and expressed his earnest hope that the five major powers could work together in the future, resolve all problems through mutual understanding, and establish lasting world peace. Finally, he raised his glass to wish Chairman Chiang good health. After the banquet, various entertainment activities were held, which won a lot of applause.

### Shanghai Opera Actor Accused

Shi Chunxuan, an actor who has moved Shanghai's leisured women's class with his Shanghai Opera performances, is now accused of "kidnapping." It is said that Chen Yukun, the owner of a hardware factory in Pudong, was recently detained by a certain unit because he had dealings with the enemy. He believes that this was instigated by Shi Chunxuan and Fan Jinkun. After being released, he reported it to the police station. Yesterday afternoon, the case was heard in the local court. Shi Chunxuan strongly defended himself, saying that he and the plaintiff were sworn brothers. When Chen was arrested, he tried to help him. When the unit wanted the plaintiff to pay four gold bars as a fine, he tried to borrow nine taels from his wife to help. The court ordered a postponement of the hearing because the case still needs to be investigated. Bail was denied, and he was returned to custody.

### Rickshaw Race; Misses from Various Countries Participate

This Saturday, the U.S. military in Shanghai will hold an unprecedented and interesting rickshaw race. It is reported that seventeen misses from the United States, China, the Soviet Union, and Canada have signed up to participate.

### Deputy Minister Xu of the Central Propaganda Department Reports on New Government Measures; Pan Gongzhan and Others Hope the Press Will Exercise its Authority

Xu Xiaoyan, Deputy Minister of the Central Propaganda Department, hosted a tea party for the press in this city at the Kang Le Restaurant at 3:00 PM yesterday. Pan Gongzhan, Hu Pu'an, Cheng Cangbo, Feng Youzhen, Chen Xunxi, Zhan Wenhun, Ma Xingye, and more than 70 reporters from various newspapers attended.

Comforting Colleagues in the Press

Xu stood up to give a speech, saying that the Central Government has been very concerned about the press in Shanghai for the past seven or eight years. The main purpose of his trip to Shanghai from Chongqing is to represent the Central Government and express the greatest respect and sympathy to the colleagues in the press who have struggled hard in Shanghai. Secondly, over the years, colleagues in the press in Shanghai and colleagues serving in the war zones in the Southeast may have had many misunderstandings about the situation in the rear. Today, he took this opportunity to give a brief report to the colleagues in the recovered areas. The two points that the current government is most concerned about regarding the general situation in the rear are:

Reducing the Burden on the People

First, we will strive to reduce the burden on the people so that the people of the whole country can have the opportunity to rest and recuperate after the eight years of the Anti-Japanese War, such as: (1) Stopping conscription. (2) Reducing taxes. (3) Reorganizing the army, reducing the original 300-plus divisions to 200-plus divisions, reducing national expenditures, which also means reducing the burden on the people. (4) The wartime consumption tax was originally a measure that the government had to take at the time, so the government had clearly ordered its abolition before the end of the war. (5) Simplifying tax collection procedures to facilitate the people. (6) Abolishing traffic control to facilitate travel and commerce. The government is doing its best to do all of the above. The recovered areas suffered even more than the rear during the eight years of the Anti-Japanese War, so the government, regardless of all financial difficulties, will exempt land tax for one year. Not only that, but the government is also concerned about the suffering of tenant farmers and poor farmers and is implementing a 25% rent reduction, reducing the rent paid by tenants to landlords by one-quarter, hoping that the media will assist the government in promoting this new initiative so that every people can understand.

Strive for Social Stability

Second, we will strive for social stability, such as stabilizing finance. The government has made great efforts, and the government is also doing its best to assist in production and industry. The government has loaned more than 5 billion yuan to factories in the rear in the past two or three months, making every effort to stabilize society. The government's most difficult problem at present is the internal affairs problem, which is the Communist Party problem. The Central Government has always hoped that this problem can be resolved through political means, but recently the Communist Party has dismantled railways in North China, blocked traffic, hindered the surrender of the National Army, and raised the issue of the so-called "liberated areas," making the problem even more difficult to solve. However, the Central Government still hopes that the Communist Party problem can be resolved by political means.

Chairman Pan and Others Give Speeches

Pan Gongzhan, Cheng Cangbo, Gui Zhongshu, Li Zikuan, Yuan Yeyu, Peng Leshan, Li Qiusheng, Jin Qindi, and others also stood up to give speeches. Pan hoped to use the power of public opinion to solve the Communist Party problem, tell the facts to the public, and the press should stand on a fair and impartial position to make serious criticisms and ask the people, "Should the Communist Army block traffic?" "Should the National Army be sent to receive the nine northeastern provinces?" The press can test public opinion to clarify what is right and wrong in the eyes of the common people. Cheng said that the two issues that the people of Shanghai are most concerned about now are: (1) They are heartbroken by the number of unqualified receiving personnel, and the media should expose this darkness as much as possible so that the receiving personnel can be vigilant and the government can pay attention to punishing them at any time. (2) The people of Shanghai are deeply troubled by the Communist Army's destruction of traffic and the National Army's inability to carry out its receiving tasks, but their position on the government has always been consistent. Gui Zhongshu reported that foreign people have incorrect views on China's internal affairs from time to time, and he hoped that the press would correct them. Li Zikuan hoped that the Central Government could abolish the Shanghai press censorship system to realize freedom of speech. Yuan, Peng, Li, and others all hoped that the Central Government could provide as much information as possible about important current events. Deputy Minister Xu then responded to each of the opinions raised. At 5:30, the tea party came to a successful conclusion in a very harmonious atmosphere.

Deputy Minister Xu was also invited by the Shanghai Special City Party Headquarters and the Shanghai Branch of the Youth League to hold a symposium at the City Party Headquarters at 11:00 AM yesterday. The executive committee of the City Party Headquarters and the staff of the branch of the Youth League all participated. Xu gave many instructions on the publicity policy in the future.

Deputy Minister Xu Hosts Press

### The Gold Market Was Active Again Yesterday Amidst Talk of Free Foreign Exchange Trading

Results Were 37,000 Better Than Before; Public Bonds and US Dollars Both Rose in Tandem

Yesterday (the 27th), due to Chairman Chiang's speech not mentioning a word about foreign exchange quotations, short sellers felt disappointed. At the same time, reports indicated that the government would adopt a free buying and selling policy for foreign exchange, causing a backlash and a surge in sentiment. At the opening, buy orders were shouted at 780,000, and soon broke through the 800,000 mark. At this time, short sellers were cornered, and buying pressure was suppressed again, causing prices to fall back to 780,000. Afterwards, the US dollar stood firm, and northern financial groups made some advances, stabilizing gold prices. However, as the US dollar continued to rise, hedging activities increased, leading to a situation where supply was less than demand in the gold market. As short sellers began to cover their positions, the market rebounded sharply at noon, rising to over 820,000. Finally, the market fluctuated again, resulting in an improvement of 37,000 compared to the previous day. Silver jewelry also rose to 87,000, while silver taels were still priced at 650 per tael. Initially, silver dollars hovered around 430, but eventually, due to sporadic purchases by smaller investors, the selling price rose slightly to 445 yuan.

US Dollars

Due to the government's adoption of a free buying and selling policy for foreign exchange, cotton mills were eager to settle accounts, leading to a sharp rise in the market. The price increased from 1310 yuan to 1375 yuan, eventually settling around 1350 yuan, an increase of 50 yuan compared to the previous close. The Hong Kong dollar was relatively stable, following the gold market, without any special stimulus. The Australian pound was around 3,300, and the rupee was between 300 and 330 yuan.

Public Bonds

Continued to be surrounded by buying pressure, and external investors also frequently absorbed them. Large investors rode the wave, and Type C bonds even broke through the 400 yuan mark. As a result, all bonds rose by 50 to 65 yuan compared to the previous close. After the sharp rise, be cautious of insiders taking profits.

Chinese Stocks

Off-exchange trading was still not smooth. The rebound in the gold market led to some sporadic investment by retail investors, causing large-cap stocks to stabilize slightly, while small stocks generally rose by about 10%.

Foreign Stocks

Trading shifted from sluggish to stable, also influenced by the gold and bond markets. There were quite a few buyers at the end, and as a result, Ewo Cotton Mills recovered from within 1400 yuan to around 1500 yuan, with all stocks rebounding slightly compared to the previous day.

The underground interest rate market saw renewed activity from speculators, and demand gradually increased. After a period of calm, yesterday saw a slight rise, generally ranging from 13% to 16%.

Rice Market Suffers from Abundant Supply

Yesterday, the rice market was depressed due to abundant supply from various sources and rumors of imported rice arriving. Prices for superior rice fell by 300-400 yuan, while medium-quality rice fell by 600-700 yuan. White rice and processed rice also fell by 500-600 yuan. Flour sales remained sluggish, continuing to weaken by nearly 100 yuan. The oil market rebounded slightly after being weak, due to strong demand from the Ningbo financial groups, rising by 1,000-2,000 yuan. Soybean prices were expected to rebound by 200-300 yuan due to the revitalization of Shantou bean cake sales. Raw peanuts were unchanged. Shaoxing wine sales were sluggish due to continuous arrivals from northern Jiangsu, leading to a downward trend. Wine merchants released their stocks of yellow wine, and new products entered the market, softening sentiment.

Yarn Sales Were Quite Active

The yarn market rebounded with the gold price, stabilizing sentiment. Sales from the inland and Shanghai-Nanjing lines increased, making transactions quite active. However, the focus was on 20-count yarn, which rose by around 20,000 yuan, while 16-count yarn sales were sluggish, and the price was similar to the previous day.

Coal Trading Was Sparse

The coal market remained in a quiet state, with sellers finding it difficult to sell, leading to a decline in trading. However, local prices remained stable. Arrivals of firewood boards for the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway (Haining, Xiashi, Changan, Linping) continued to increase, leading to a price decline. However, the price of chestnut flowers, used by inland factories as a substitute for coal, remained very stable. Charcoal arrivals have been relatively low recently, showing a slight rise.

Hardware Transactions Were Very Few

Yesterday, the hardware market remained stagnant, without any improvement. Merchants were still releasing stocks, but there were very few buyers, and price cuts were severe. Therefore, there were only inquiries, but no actual transactions.

### Industrial and Commercial Registration: Severe Penalties

Special Report: The city's industrial and commercial registration will be announced and implemented by the Social Affairs Bureau immediately. It is reported that the method will be based on zoning. The area for the tenth phase is defined as east of Xizang Road, north of Nanjing Road, south of Suzhou Creek, and east to the Bund. Regardless of whether the business is a sole proprietorship or a partnership, and regardless of whether it has been registered before, it must register according to the deadline and in accordance with the law. This registration is mandatory and different from the pre-war registration. If resisted, penalties such as suspension of business or fines of up to 10,000 yuan will be imposed according to regulations.

### Ham and Preserved Meat Industry Seeks Batch Allocation

During the enemy and puppet regime, a considerable amount of the stock of ham and preserved meat in this port was requisitioned by the enemy army. Recently, the industry association has petitioned the authorities to request the speedy unsealing of these goods and the allocation to the industry for sale at a fair price to meet market demand.

### Reorganizing the Stated Capital Amount

— Pan Shihao

(Continued from November 26th)

Decline in Currency Purchasing Power

It is not excessive to have this in the capital account. Anyone who knows the market situation will not consider my words biased. The pure asset base that is less than the legal currency capital amount should be appropriately reduced to ensure that assets are not inflated and capital is not lost. Then general accounting can be universally reorganized. The secret reserve fund with the nature of undistributed earnings should be used as the transfer amount for the capital amount as soon as possible. If there is still a surplus in the secret reserve after the transfer, or other assets need to be upgraded in valuation, it should be handled separately through capital increase procedures. It must not be confused with this reorganization of the stated capital amount. Furthermore, by extension, the surplus under the capital account should be based on the principle of "realized profits." This is also clearly stipulated in the income tax regulations. Now, with the decline in the purchasing power of currency, the current value of various assets is often far beyond the original price. However, in accounting, valuation increases are not allowed until profits are realized through the sale. Therefore, when reorganizing the stated capital amount, it is best to have a secret reserve available for transfer. I believe that asset appreciation should be transferred with extreme caution, and try to avoid pre-inflating the stated amount of inventory, so as not to conceal future sales revenue, hinder legitimate tax revenue, and the legitimate profit sharing of labor. However, the appreciation of fixed assets is different from business income, and it is still feasible to use it to transfer the stated amount of capital. In this case, it is truly said that

Each Situation is Different

If the original capital was legal tender, and it was combined into puppet currency at a ratio of two to one by the puppet regime, it should of course be directly restored to the original legal tender amount. If the capital was originally legal tender and was increased with puppet currency, as long as the pure asset situation is still good, it can also be balanced as the legal tender amount. If the capital is entirely received in puppet currency, of course, more attention should be paid to its pure asset situation. However, if its current value is good, then the balancing method is not impossible. Even if there is a shortfall, it can be appropriately reduced. At a time when the government is striving to revive industry and stabilize prices, having a substantial reserve is beneficial to both the public and private sectors. If the capital is converted at a ratio of two hundred to one as claimed by some people, and the resulting false surplus is taxed according to law and dividends are distributed according to custom, wouldn't it be cutting more than half of each company's reserves? In recent years, some entrepreneurs have been nominally successful, but actually engaged in speculative profiteering. However, the majority have been silently enduring and struggling in hardship. The depreciation of puppet currency has resulted in this false surplus, but if calculated based on the reduction of the purchasing power of currency, the losses are beyond words. Can we bear to see them suffer further unreasonable destruction? Some say that puppet currency is worthless. This is true now. The more puppet currency of 5,000 or 10,000 yuan, the more useless it becomes. Not only two hundred to one, but even with further discounts, no legitimate industrial or commercial enterprise would want to accept it or value it. However, we in Shanghai have endured hardships and should not forget that

Currency is a Medium

People's livelihoods cannot stop, and transactions cannot cease. The medium is a tool for easy exchange. When using it for this exchange, every household cannot do without it. This was true when the puppet regime required the people to exchange legal tender for puppet currency at a ratio of two to one. Even after that, conscientious entrepreneurs either moved materials internally to supplement the Great Rear, or moved funds internally to establish a new foundation in the interior. The actual exchange rate between puppet currency and legal tender was still balanced last summer, ten to one this spring, and only eighty or ninety to one when the enemy surrendered and Shanghai was liberated, not as high as it is today. If people use the current worthlessness of puppet currency to infer that the puppet currency invested by capital holders in the past should also be discounted more, it would not be fair. After the capital was received in puppet currency, this medium of exchange has long been separated from the investment process. We can recognize that the puppet currency currently in circulation is illegal and should not be considered. However, if we say that capital received in puppet currency is also illegal and should not be considered, would that be fair? Therefore, I dare to solemnly state to all parties that the reorganization of the stated capital amount should not be confused with the reorganization of puppet currency. (To be continued)

### The Problem of the Atomic Bomb

— Huang Jiayin

According to a Reuters dispatch from Los Angeles, Dr. Bell, who participated in the manufacture of the atomic bomb, said that using plutonium instead of uranium as the raw material for the atomic bomb reduced the cost of manufacture and shortened the time. At the same time, he warned that small countries like Portugal could hide atomic bombs in warehouses in Los Angeles, and destroy them before the United States could resist. He also said that the enemy could place an atomic bomb in the sea, creating a huge wave and destroying Washington.

From this dispatch, it can be seen that the progress of the atomic bomb is rapid, and its terrible degree is becoming more and more severe.

Humans have created the atomic bomb, but can humans control the atomic bomb? In this regard, we believe that the governments of all countries must first have a unified goal for the future world in order to achieve this. If everyone works together for a better and more harmonious world, there will be no mutual suspicion, and there will be no so-called atomic bomb problem.

### Let Supermen Control the Atomic Bomb

— Yu Fan

According to a recent United Press dispatch, an unnamed American suggested using eugenics and test-tube methods to create a "United Nations Superman" as the guardian of the atomic bomb.

This proposal seems somewhat bizarre, but in deference to the suggester's opinion, it has finally been submitted to President Truman and several members of Congress and experts for review.

The purpose of the proposal is to produce the most excellent and benevolent human race, and to let these supermen control the atomic bomb with full authority, in order to achieve the goal of benefiting all mankind, so as to avoid being misused by villains.

To produce supermen, the proposer advocates that eugenic experts first select a group of the most intelligent and excellent men in the United Nations as the fathers of supermen. Similarly, a group of women with the highest eugenic value in heredity, health, education, and career should also be selected as the mothers of supermen.

"Supermen" and "Superwomen" can freely marry each other. If a "Superman" belongs to one country and a "Superwoman" belongs to another country, then the children born will represent both countries in the United Nations organization, but he or she only contributes the obligation of children to the United Nations.

The education received by "Supermen" in their childhood must be obtained in the highest academic institutions in the world, one year in a school in one country, and what he receives is world education.

The proposer also advocates that "Supermen" should travel with their mothers in their childhood, traveling around the world, reading and studying, but it must be the case that the mothers can fill this position. If the mothers cannot travel together, a "Women's Group" should be organized, which can be handled by nuns in the church.

He also argues that mothers should not be called "Miss," but should be addressed by a different "title."

As for before the supermen are born, he advocates calling this group of supermen and superwomen the "Atomic Bomb Guardian Training Center," and before the supermen have grown to an age where they have the ability to perform their duties, this group of supermen and superwomen has no right to interfere in the issue of atomic bomb control.

### Curfew

— Night Watchman

When Lao Shen was about to leave, he suddenly said to me, "Why aren't you leaving yet? The curfew starts at twelve o'clock, and the pass hasn't been arranged yet." I hadn't paid attention. I went back at half past twelve the other night, and the taxi driver didn't make things difficult for me after I explained.

I left the newspaper office at twelve o'clock. The rickshaw driver pedaled very quickly. The road was very quiet. Occasionally, drunk American sailors drove past, shouting in their mouths. My car was not stopped along the way. As I turned the corner, I was stopped by the night watchman.

The night watchman was wearing a Zhongshan suit with two police officers. This time, I explained with what I said two days ago, to no avail. It was useless to explain with more pleasing words. He insisted that we (there were three other people who were also slightly detained) go to the police station to "say a word." There was no choice but to go to the nearby police station together, with the drivers pushing the rickshaws and crowding behind.

The police station was more lively than a dance hall, and like a theater just after the show was over. The open space was full of rickshaws. The entrance to the interrogation room was crowded with rickshaw drivers. Upon entering, it was crowded with people, all of whom were rickshaw drivers. The procedure for enforcing the curfew was also convenient. Each person handed over their residence permit, and the police officer copied down their name, gender, age, and address. Those who did not have a residence permit verbally stated it and it was recorded. After recording, they retreated and stood on the porch. After the rickshaw drivers had left, only six curfew violators remained in the room.

One was a Russian dancer, very beautiful and seemed very witty. She started by complaining angrily, "What, are you going to detain me here? You've made a big mistake! You'll regret it! I'm an American, I'm a GI!"

She had a good eloquence, immediately reminding me of Yuan Muzhi's "Woman and Dog," but good eloquence was useless. The police officer saw her costumed dancing clothes, long boots, and mismatched clothes, and determined that she was a dancer. A dancer was definitely not an American, and if she wasn't an American, there was nothing to say.

The police officer finally agreed to her request, letting her sit in a small iron cage with another Chinese woman. The Chinese woman never opened her mouth, took out two movie magazines, and the two looked at them quietly.

After the dancer was questioned, a man in his thirties, dressed stylishly in a Western suit, walked over, supporting a woman in a red cheongsam, a short black coat, and a beautiful face. She was obviously drunk, staggering, and turned to put her face close to the wall, crying softly. "What, is the Military Commission useless? Or, do you want to make a phone call to the International Hotel? Or detain me, let this lady go out, it would be inconvenient for this lady to be here all night until tomorrow." The man was obviously anxious about the lady's status relationship. His face was flushed, and he angrily patted the railing.

But the section chief on the opposite side just shook his head repeatedly, "No, no." The man had no choice but to give up after several struggles. He helped the lady in to sit down, and a police officer very tactfully gave up his seat, leaning against the lady together. The man sat down and both closed their eyes to rest.

At this time, I turned around and saw the director was debating with another night violator. The director was rambling on, not knowing what he was saying. The person was anxiously searching all over his body. "Here, here, this is my agency's ID card." The director said, "Not releasing you, no, it's before the 12th, before, before is illegal, illegal is not recognized." "Here, here, there's one after the 12th," the civil servant pulled out another one from his inside pocket. The director looked at it for a full five minutes. "No, no, this seal is not official, I don't seem to have seen this kind of seal?" He raised his head and pondered, thinking for a long time again. "Or, you can make a phone call to your agency, send someone to prove it?" The man said that he would rather sit until six o'clock, it would take two days to send someone to prove it, at least sitting in the police station for three days.

Finally, it was my turn. I had a great argument to say, but now I don't know where it went. From the words of the director and section chief, I have seen the great significance of the curfew. Those who have the strength contribute the strength, and those who don't have the strength make up the numbers, otherwise how can we call it military-civilian cooperation? I didn't say anything, and waited patiently to go home at six o'clock.

"So everyone must understand the meaning of the curfew, the meaning of the curfew," the director said a few words after everyone was settled. "Another robbery happened today, clothes were stripped off, for your life's sake." I felt creepy when I heard it, but when I thought that I was in the police station, I felt relieved again. The director saw that it was getting late and went to rest.

As soon as the director left, the police officer also went to sleep. There were six people left in the room. I sat down on an empty chair next to the drunken lady. It was very quiet in the night, occasionally hearing the sound of cars passing on the street. Seeing the neon lights across the street still lit, the fatigue made people a little blurry. Seeing the Russian dancer with her hair disheveled, already asleep, she looked like a foreign Miss in distress. Occasionally, the shadow of the rickshaw driver flashed on the porch. I thought of what the director said just now, and I thought of the Liangshan heroes劫法塲(robbing the execution ground), and the 白龍廟英雄小聚義 (heroes gathering in White Dragon Temple). I opened the Times magazine and read it, one article, two articles. I heard snoring, and when I looked back, I saw the drunken lady and the man sleeping face to face tightly. The man must not have fallen asleep, he was still gently stroking the lady's hand with one hand. I felt cold on my body.

Looking up at the clock, it was only half past four, but the sound of roosters crowing at dawn and the shouting of night soil collectors came from afar. The police officer came out and told everyone to get up and leave, so he shouted the names and issued residence permits. It was 4:45 when I came out.

I walked out of the police station to go home, the moon was still shining in the sky. Passing through the cold and deserted streets, I felt a little scared, but when I thought that the curfew had been lifted, I felt relieved.

### Worthy of Attention

According to a Reuters report, stamps printed with the rising sun and saluting suicide pilots are still in common use throughout Japan. This matter seems small at first glance, but it may secretly produce terrible side effects on the Japanese people. We hope that the Allied authorities will pay close attention to this seemingly small but actually large matter, and also pay attention to other similar matters in Japan.

### Belief

— Shou Juan

No matter what we do, no matter how difficult it is, we must have a belief; with belief, anything can be done, and any difficulty can be solved.

In the early days of the European War, when the Allied countries abandoned southern Norway, Germany's blitzkrieg was very successful and unstoppable. It seemed that the Allied forces could not stop it. One night, the British writer Leiston bought a newspaper from an old man selling newspapers on Street Street and asked the old man casually, "How is the news tonight?" The old man replied, "I don't know, sir. Although I sell newspapers, I don't read them; but I have a firm belief that we will eventually win the final victory."

There are many factors for our country's final victory; and the biggest factor is actually due to the belief of the highest authorities. He believed that the Japanese invaders would definitely surrender and that our country would definitely win. Because of the firm belief, the national policy will never be shaken, and the final victory will belong to us.

Before young people do anything, no matter how difficult it is, they must have a firm belief. Without belief, nothing can be done, with belief, nothing is impossible.

### Question Mark

— Wu Dai

Weng Wenhao, Vice President of the Executive Yuan, talked about the various adverse phenomena in the recovered areas in Beiping, with great emotion, saying that many things were so bad that people could not believe it. And said, "I can not be an official, these many bad things must be investigated."

We believe that these words of Vice President Weng can be fulfilled.

But at the same time, we see that the attitude of some officials is probably slightly different from that of Vice President Weng. They seem to be saying: "How can I not be an official? Why must these many bad things be investigated?"

The words are the same, just with a question mark added.

### Tears

— Murong Yan

I imagine I am sitting in the magnificent box of a grand opera house, under the expansive dome. Beside me is Sharon. The theater is as silent as if devoid of all living things, except for the singing and music on stage. The dimness of the auditorium sets off the action on stage, making it even brighter. The stage lights illuminate Sharon's pale face like a still plaster statue, occasionally crossed by a fleeting, pleasant smile.

However, I saw Sharon's unhappy face not there, but in a comfortable sitting room.

"I'm not going," she said. Three days ago, I had invited her to see a dramatic play, a play of life, this afternoon.

Her refusal was without reason. But she refused.

"Why?"

No answer.

"Why?"

This was a trick of emotion. She was crying, for no reason at all.

I watched her tears roll down her cheeks. I gently comforted her, for no reason. Then I wiped her wet eyes with a handkerchief.

Afterward, she smiled, also for no reason, without justification.

Some tears are completely unnecessary.

### Wu Qunzhi's Pen

— Kekou

It is reported that Mr. Wu, the president of the Bank of Guangdong Province in San Francisco, presented a fountain pen as a farewell souvenir to Admiral Nimitz, commander of the U.S. Pacific Fleet, after the Pearl Harbor incident four years ago, and asked him to use this pen to sign Japan's surrender document. After Japan surrendered, Nimitz did as requested. Recently, Nimitz returned to the United States and returned the valuable pen to Mr. Wu as a memento.

Although this is a tale of rare and amusing events, Mr. Wu's conviction and vision are worthy of our admiration!

Short Story Masterpiece

### The Enemy (7)

— Pearl S. Buck, Translated by Zhu Qi

Under such a sense of superiority, she unthinkingly leaned down and loosened the white man's tattered clothes, which barely covered his body. After she had unbuttoned his chest, she dipped the clean little towel that Yuzi had brought in hot water and carefully washed his face for him. Although the man's skin had been roughened by the wind and sun, the texture was delicate, and his skin must have been very fair when he was a child.

Now that this man was no longer a child, she didn't like him any more than she had at first, but thinking about it, she washed the man's upper body. But she didn't dare to turn him over. Where had Sadao gone? His anger having subsided, she became anxious again and wiped her hands on the wrung-out towel. Fearing that the man would catch a chill, she covered him with the quilt again.

She whispered, "Sadao!"

As she called out, he happened to be preparing to come in. His hand was already on the door, and now he pushed it open. She saw him holding a surgical bag and already wearing a surgical gown.

She exclaimed, "Have you decided to operate on him?"

He said curtly, "Yes." He turned his back to her, shook out a sterilized towel, and laid it on the floor in a higher part of the room, then took out his surgical instruments and placed them on it.

He said, "Bring the towels."

Obediently and anxiously, she walked to the shelf and took down the towels. She should also get a few old straw mats to prevent the delicate carpet on the floor from being stained with blood. She went to the back balcony and brought in a handful of straw mats that the gardener had placed there to protect the delicate shrubs on cold nights.

When she returned to the room, she saw that it was already useless. Fresh blood had seeped through the dressing on the man's wound, staining the mat under him.

She cried out, "Oh, the mat!"

"Yes, it's stained," Sadao replied, seemingly unconcerned. He ordered her, "Help me turn him over."

She silently obeyed, and he carefully began to wash the man's back.

She said, "Yuzi wouldn't wash him."

"Then did you wash him?" Sadao asked, without pausing his quick, decisive movements.

She said, "Yes."

He seemed not to have heard. She had long been accustomed to his intense focus on his work. She wondered if he could notice what he was operating on while he was operating so wonderfully.

He said, "You have to give him anesthesia when he needs it."

"Me? I've never done such a thing," she replied blankly.

He said impatiently, "It's very easy."

He was now removing the bandage, and the blood flowed even faster. He looked at the wound under the bright surgeon's lamp on his head. Calmly and with interest, he said, "The bullet is still inside, and I don't know how deep the rock wound is. If it's not too deep, maybe I can remove the bullet. But the bleeding is not just superficial. He has lost a lot of blood."

At this point, Hana choked up. He looked up and saw that her face was already ashen.

"Don't faint," he said coldly. He did not put down the tool he was using. "If I stop now, this man will surely die." She put her hand over her mouth, jumped up, and ran out of the room. He heard her retching in the garden. But he continued to work.

### Social Service: Where Can the People's Voice Be Heard?

— Bu Ping Ming (Speaking Out Against Injustice)

Most Depressed When Complaints Cannot Be Heard; Incomplete Politics Leads to Loss of Popular Support

Mr. Editor: I have been reading your esteemed publication for days, and I can see the spirit of respecting public opinion and serving the people, leaping off the page, which I deeply admire! Newspapers are the voice of the people and a public tool for promoting public opinion. However, where can the people's lamentations be heard? Hasn't the central government already stipulated "freedom of speech" after the victory of the War of Resistance? But how many newspapers are willing to genuinely speak for the people and represent public opinion? I hope that your newspaper can truly live up to its name and fulfill this important mission. The public will naturally wholeheartedly support your newspaper's position. Here are a few suggestions that I would like to contribute, please give me the opportunity to publish them.

(1) Thoroughly Punish Traitors: The regulations for punishing traitors have long been announced, and the news of the commencement of trials has also been seen in the newspapers. However, the number one and number two traitors are all people of very low status. Why not first deal with those who hold special appointments and those who are known for colluding with the enemy? The newspapers also reported that more than 400 people were arrested in Shanghai, but only 30 or so were sent to court. Why is the case not being resolved for the rest of the people? It is said that some are allowed bail. The common people are baffled by the subtle clues in the process. The responsible authorities should publicly announce what is happening.

(2) Selling at Reduced Prices Is Not a Good Method: A few days ago, I saw in the newspaper that a large amount of cotton cloth was taken out of the sealed treasury and handed over to the four major companies for sale at reduced prices, and that a large amount of white sugar was being auctioned off on the Bund. The common people have doubts about these two methods. Because very few people can buy them. If we consider Shanghai's five million citizens, I don't know if the benefit is gained by one in a thousand or one in ten thousand. In my opinion, the "rationing system" is much better than selling at reduced prices. Strict rationing of daily necessities is the fairest method and can be adopted.

(3) Roads for Special Classes: Nanjing Road is the most prosperous street in Shanghai, but now it has become a road exclusively enjoyed by special classes, which is too arbitrary and unreasonable. Only cars are allowed to travel, and rickshaws and pedicabs are not allowed to pass, which not only affects the market, but also makes it impossible for the old and the young to pass. I have two grandparents in their seventies who, because of their old age, have wanted to go to Nanjing Road several times, but they have been unable to walk there. Children under the age of ten are also unable to approach it. In fact, even though traffic is congested, as long as more traffic police are dispatched to maintain order, it is not necessary to restrict human-powered vehicles. Moreover, Jiujiang and Hankou Roads have already decided to implement one-way traffic, so why not restore Nanjing Road to its original state? (The rest is omitted)

Editor's Note: I agree very much with the opinions expressed by Mr. Bu Ping Ming. Reporting news and promoting public opinion is our duty, and we will certainly work hard to do it and will not shirk our responsibilities. There are indeed many unreasonable things in the current society that need the public to supervise and urge the responsible authorities to be vigilant. We are now in an era of democracy, and any political affairs should be based on the people, which no one can prevent. I advocate that all "people's grievances" and "people's complaints" should not be kept in one's stomach, unspoken and unvented, or discussed in whispers and suspected in secret. These are not solutions. We should have a spirit of fearlessness, a bright and upright attitude, and express our views in writing and send them directly to this column. We will give priority to publishing them and making them public to the masses, so that the responsible authorities can use them as reference material. This is an excellent thing, and I wonder if readers agree?

### Opening Shanghai-Haimen Shipping Route: Urging China Merchants Steam Navigation Company to Handle It

— Haike (Seafarer)

Recently, it has been reported that coastal and river shipping routes have been opened one after another, and that the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company has taken over enemy and puppet ships, a considerable number. Therefore, all routes and un-opened ports should be quickly reopened to facilitate merchants and travelers. I, the writer, have lived in Haimen for generations and travel between Shanghai and Haimen from time to time. Seeing the various sufferings of sailing vessels over the years, it is truly difficult to describe them in a single sentence. For example: (1) the boats are small and crowded, and there are no awning facilities, so passengers are prone to disease in the summer and rainy weather; (2) the boats stop in the middle of the river if there is no wind, and it is unbearable to hear of pirates coming to rob them; (3) sudden strong winds may cause capsizing, and lives are in danger. The above is by no means a false statement. On behalf of the people of Haimen and Qidong counties, I respectfully request the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company to quickly allocate two ships of about 1,000 tons each, sailing daily to and from the ports of Haiqi, which will not only ensure the safe travel of passengers, but also allow the transportation of the main products of the two counties, such as cotton, homespun cloth, grains, livestock, and local products, to Shanghai in large quantities for supply. Therefore, the resumption of shipping can no longer be delayed. Before the war, there were four ships traveling on the Shanghai-Haimen route, two ships a day, which was very convenient. Now that the victory of the War of Resistance has been three months, this route has not been reopened, and the people are looking forward to it. I urge the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company to quickly plan to reopen the route in the short term to meet the expectations of the people.

Editor's Note: The reasons for Mr. Haike's request for the resumption of shipping on behalf of the people of Haiqi counties are sufficient and are indeed an urgent matter at present. We hope that the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company will quickly prepare and provide us with information on the handling of the matter for publication to meet the expectations of the people.

### Service Briefs

Kunshan reader asks: In the newspaper in the upper part of September, it was reported that "all land sales in the occupied areas are invalid." I don't know if it can be redeemed at the original price? I hope you can provide details in your column. (Note) Land that was illegally occupied by the enemy and puppets or forcibly traded by using the power of the enemy and puppets during the period of occupation can be redeemed at the original price. See the regulations issued by the Shanghai Land Administration Bureau for details.

Wang Zhicheng is looking for the owner: At 12:00 noon on the 25th of this month, I picked up 1 million yuan of puppet currency near the Siming Bank on Nanjing Road. I hope the owner will specify what items were attached to it and come to the Tongkang Chengold Shop in the Laojiuzhang Building, Gaoyang Lane, Nanjing Road, to find Wang Zhicheng within this week. If it is not claimed after the deadline, it will be used for the charitable activities organized by Shen Bao and Xin Bao for the benefit of the owner.
