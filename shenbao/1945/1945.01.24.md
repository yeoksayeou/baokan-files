### House Budget General Meeting: Japanese Prime Minister Answers Questions on War Situation; High Morale of Troops on the Philippine Front

Tokyo, 23rd (Central News Agency) – During the general budget meeting of the Japanese House of Representatives on the 22nd, Mr. Masazumi Ando questioned the government about its views on the decisive battle situation in Luzon. Prime Minister Koiso replied: "While the future course of the war cannot be predicted, the morale of our troops on the Philippine front is extremely high and vigorous. Especially in light of the enemy's recent hesitant movements, I have assured our troops that they will be able to skillfully plan and bravely fight, annihilate the enemy forces, and achieve a favorable advancement in the war situation. As for the impact of the operations around the Philippines on the future course of the war and our nation's strength, I need not elaborate further, as everyone is already fully aware. In short, we have great anticipation and hope for the development of this war situation."

Tokyo, 23rd (Central News Agency) – The general budget meeting of the Japanese House of Representatives, which began on the 22nd, is proceeding with earnest deliberation, and is expected to conclude on the 26th. After the conclusion of questions in the subcommittee meetings on the 28th and 29th, the bill will be submitted to the plenary session for approval on the 30th. Furthermore, if the new government submits a temporary supplementary military expenditure bill during this period, it is expected that it will be immediately deliberated and passed on the same day, and submitted to the plenary session. A decision has been made to exert every effort to cooperate in the implementation of the budget.

Enhancing Air Combat Strength

Tokyo, 23rd (Central News Agency) – Mr. Tanaka Funada raised a question on the issue of expanding air combat strength at the House of Representatives budget meeting on the 23rd. Minister of Munitions Yoshida replied: "Under today's war situation, producing the required aircraft is indeed an extremely difficult problem due to resource constraints. However, the production in Showa 19 (1944) has increased significantly compared to Showa 16 (1941). The front lines urgently need aircraft, and at the same time, the manufacturing sector in the rear is not bound by past plans and is working hard to expedite production. To meet the needs of the soldiers on the front lines, we continue to fight day and night, even under air raids. I believe that we still have room for improvement in transportation and labor. While I cannot disclose specific figures for production quantity, the upward trend in manufacturing far exceeds that of the enemy United States. The only question is how to maintain this upward trend in the future. I believe that all military production efforts must be concentrated on enhancing air combat strength to achieve this goal."

### Foreign Minister Clarifies Belief in Overall Sino-Japanese Peace; Full Support to the National Government

Tokyo, 23rd (Central News Agency) – Foreign Minister Shigemitsu, in response to Mr. Nakatani's question at the budget meeting on the 23rd, clarified the government's strong support and belief in overall peace between China and Japan. The main points are as follows: "The spirit of the Greater East Asia Declaration is to thoroughly return East Asia to the hands of East Asians, so that East Asia can be stable. However, Chongqing is indeed obstructed by the military and political forces of the United States stationed there. Therefore, eliminating the aggressive forces of the enemy United States is of utmost importance and urgency. However, the matter of Chongqing should be regarded as a domestic issue, to be handled primarily by the Chinese themselves, which is only natural. The Empire will consistently base its efforts on the principles of the Greater East Asia Declaration, in the hope of achieving success. The late Chairman Wang Jingwei succeeded to the aspirations of Sun Yat-sen, the Father of the Nation, and advocated Pan-Asianism. At the beginning of the establishment of the National Government, he advocated overall peace and sought to accomplish the unfinished goals of the Father of the Nation. Chairman Chen Gongbo also deeply understood the righteous cause and emerged to save China from its current crisis. The Empire will provide full assistance to this endeavor."

### Mr. Ando Delivers a Solemn Speech

Tokyo, 23rd (Central News Agency) – During the questioning at the budget meeting on the 22nd, Mr. Masazumi Ando spoke of the illegal act of American aircraft indiscriminately bombing the Ise Grand Shrine and delivered a solemn speech as follows: "It is clear that the Ise Grand Shrine area and its vicinity have no military or production facilities. The enemy aircraft must have conducted aerial reconnaissance beforehand and fully understood this. Unexpectedly, they still bombed the shrine. This kind of barbaric act is unforgivable by both gods and humans and is deeply resented by all one hundred million citizens. The enemy aircraft's desecration of this revered shrine of the nation will not diminish the Japanese people's original intention to complete the holy war. Instead, it will arouse their fighting spirit and strengthen their determination to fight against the enemy with a common hatred. The government and the people must respond to this illegal and violent act, considering the sacrifice of the divine spirit as our own sacrifice. We must firmly resolve to win the war and resolutely destroy the enemy."

They began to retreat from the vicinity of Lake Hamana at approximately 4:00 PM. The battle results are currently under investigation. Due to the fierce pursuit by the Japanese air defense forces, the damage on the ground was very minor."

Over Four Thousand Killed and Injured in Bombing of Hong Kong Residential Area

Hong Kong, 23rd (Central News Agency) – The Chongqing-U.S. Air Force raided Hong Kong again on the 21st, indiscriminately bombing and strafing Chinese residential areas, killing and injuring over four thousand Chinese. Over 20 Chongqing-U.S. Air Force B-24 aircraft, taking off from the Kunming base, intruded into Hong Kong at approximately 3:45 AM on the 21st. Fearing Japanese military attacks, they blindly dropped bombs from above and then hastily fled. The areas affected by this indiscriminate bombing were mostly densely populated Chinese shops and residential areas. Over 500 buildings were damaged, over a thousand people were killed, and over three thousand were injured.

### Japanese Special Attack Corps; Courageous Spirit; Instills Fear in Enemy Aircrews

Tokyo, 23rd (Central News Agency) – The enemy, known for its vast material resources, is experiencing shortages due to supply difficulties. Furthermore, due to the unjust nature of the war and the weakness of spiritual conviction, the enemy's fear is intensifying. In addition, what the enemy fears most is the courageous spirit of the Japanese army. This fact is evident in a diary found on the body of an enemy aircrew member who was shot down by the Japanese army in a recent attack on a certain location. The diary stated: "On a certain day, the terrifying Japanese aircraft formation flew in again today. Due to the daily attacks by Japanese aircraft, we are all suffering from sleep deprivation. Even now, just hearing the sound of Japanese aircraft, our spirits are disoriented." Their state of fear and panic was such. Furthermore, on a certain day, the Japanese army formed a special attack air corps. Yesterday, they sank a U.S. aircraft carrier in the Leyte Gulf and Sulu Sea areas. It is said that the Japanese special attack corps uses one aircraft to exchange for one ship, colliding with them in a kamikaze manner. This type of combat method is truly a tactic that no other country in the world possesses. When discussing the special attack corps, the aircrews all change color. Therefore, it has recently been confirmed that there is great fear of the special attack corps within the barracks."

### Washington Conceals Bombing of Macao Incident

### Glimpses of Suzhou

— Yifei

Provincial Administration Gradually Becoming Clear

It is undeniable that the past Jiangsu administration had many unsatisfactory aspects. Although the tax situation was extremely complicated, the lack of unity between the military and political affairs was a significant factor. In order to eliminate past obstacles and increase administrative efficiency, the central government implemented a policy of military and political unification, and appointed a Jiangsu native to govern Jiangsu, hoping to achieve twice the result with half the effort. Therefore, Mr. Ren Yuandao, a native of Hai, was specially transferred to take charge of the military and political power of Jiangsu Province, bringing a fresh atmosphere. Upon taking office, Mr. Ren announced the three key points of his future administration: respecting public opinion, eliminating corruption, and stabilizing people's livelihoods, all of which are essential and desired by the public. Mr. Ren has been in office for over two months, during which he has convened county administration, security, police, education, and construction conferences, presiding over each meeting in person. His spirit of diligence and hard work is admirable. This is also a manifestation of Mr. Ren's determination to govern with vigor and reform with determination. When the reporter stayed in Suzhou, he had the opportunity to meet with Mr. Ren, who informed him of several points: (1) At this time of the decisive year of the Greater East Asia War, Jiangsu, as an important rear base, is determined to stand on the position of the nation and the people, and to cooperate and assist allied states to complete the holy war and achieve final victory. (2) The future administration of Jiangsu will follow the national policies already established by the National Government and the legacy of the late Chairman Wang, striving to thoroughly implement the central government's decrees within Jiangsu Province. (3) Emphasize spiritual construction, so that the group of political personnel will not be discouraged by the current difficult environment. We should embrace the spirit of the Father of the Nation's unyielding revolutionary spirit, so that the comprehensive peace that has not yet been realized can be achieved through our efforts. (4) I will lead by example, be selfless, and retain all existing personnel in the provincial administration, except for those who resign. I have also increased their salaries to ensure that they can serve with peace of mind and serve the people. This point can be reported to the elders of Jiangsu. In short, according to the reporter's observation, the provincial administration has gradually become clearer, which is truly gratifying.

Suzhou's Financial Sector

(1) Banking Industry: Before the war, there were a total of seventeen banks in Suzhou, with the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications being the giants among them. The Bank of China was established in 1913, and the Bank of Communications was established shortly after. The Jincheng Bank, a rising star, was established in 1931. At that time, the banking industry in Suzhou was extremely prosperous, worthy of being called the golden age of the industry. Taking Jincheng as an example, in the autumn of 1937, the bank's fixed deposits reached seven to eight million yuan, accounting for a large proportion of the total deposit amount. On November 12, 1937, due to military action, all banks in Suzhou ceased operations. It was not until the winter of 1939 that Zhou Wenrui, a comprador of the Bank of Taiwan, began to prepare for the establishment of the Sumin Bank, which was smaller in scale and had a limited scope of business. In 1941, due to the needs of the environment, a number of small banks were established; these small banks had weak capital, only two to three hundred thousand yuan, and their main business was lending at high interest rates. Their organizations mostly did not comply with the government's legal requirements. Now, in order to strengthen the financial sector, the government ordered all small banks on November 21 of last year to increase their capital to six million yuan. Recently, banks that have complied with the order to increase capital include Chang Kang and Yuan Yu. Banks newly established last year include Wei Ben, Wei Da, Huimin, and Minyi, which was reorganized from the Xinji Qianzhuang. The China, Bank of Communications, and Jincheng Banks, which are financially strong, resumed operations successively in 1943. Currently, there are a total of 31 banks in Suzhou. Except for the Central Reserve Bank, the Bank of Taiwan, the Jiangsu Local Bank established by the province, the Jiangsu Farmers Bank, and the semi-official Huaxing Bank, the rest are commercial organizations. The main operations of general banks are still similar to those before the war, mainly lending; the difference is that in the past, most loans were credit loans, but now some people use non-controlled products such as silk as collateral for loans from banks. Mortgages of real estate are still rare. As for the banks themselves, there are very few fixed deposits, and current deposits are temporary in nature and cannot be fully utilized, so there is often a shortage of funds. According to people in the industry, the total amount of silver and money in Suzhou now is only 500 million yuan, no wonder they are always short of funds.

(2) Money Shops: Before the war, there were twelve money shops in Suzhou. The largest in capital, such as Jinsheng and Baoda, was only 40,000 yuan. As a result of the war, all of them went bankrupt. The main reason was that the credit loans they lent to rice shops and silk shops (most of their customers were in the rice and silk industries) could not be recovered due to the business downturn in those industries, which led to the total collapse of the entire industry. Now that time has passed, they have sprung up like mushrooms after a rain, with 82 having been established one after another. The main factors for this abnormal prosperity are nothing more than the following: First, the security in the four villages surrounding Suzhou is poor, and wealthy households in the countryside bring their funds to the province, causing the market to be filled with floating funds. According to rural customs, running a bank or money shop is considered an honor. Therefore, those with capital are willing to try the taste of being a bank or money shop boss. Second, although the profit margin of the silver and money industry is said to be thin, the capital required is also low. At a time when prices are soaring, not to mention huge department stores, even opening a small cigarette and paper shop with a modest scale would require more than one million yuan, while in the past, a money shop could be established with only 300,000 to 500,000 yuan. No wonder those with floating capital flock to it.

Currently, the silver and money industries in Suzhou each have their own associations. The money industry also has a money shop reserve fund and its own bill exchange, and it also participates in the bill exchange organized by the banking industry. Organizationally, it is more advanced than the old money shops. Unfortunately, their vision is short-sighted, and they only focus on making profits, making no contribution to the urgent need for agricultural loans.

General Public Life

Under the pressure of constantly rising prices, the difficult situation of the general public in Suzhou is comparable to that of Shanghai. In fact, the suffering may be even greater than that of Shanghai, namely the tyranny of the local uniformed class. Incidents of forced purchases are endless. The reporter witnessed a person in yellow clothes with a "Procurement" armband coming to the Changchun Sauce Garden store on Jingde Road and using 600 yuan to forcibly purchase four catties of soy sauce. At first, the shop owner pleaded for leniency, but eventually succumbed. The person in yellow clothes left triumphantly after being arrogant. The merchants dared to be angry but dared not speak out. On the day the reporter left Suzhou, the provincial authorities had issued a strict prohibition, which was celebrated by the merchants, but its effect remained to be seen.

Editorial

### On the Current Wartime Parliament of Japan

The 86th session of the Japanese Parliament, the so-called "Wartime Parliament," adjourned temporarily last December 27th and resumed again on the 21st of this month. At this time of the decisive battle in the Greater East Asia War, this session of Parliament is receiving more attention from all parties. The particularly important tasks are, first, to adapt to the new situation of the decisive battle and complete the domestic decisive battle system; and second, Japan's diplomacy under the new war situation, especially further cooperation between China and Japan. I would like to express some of my views on these two points, in the hope of attracting the attention and efforts of informed people in both countries.

Regarding the completion of the domestic decisive battle system in Japan, there has been new progress recently. The following three points are particularly noteworthy and are expected to be deliberated by this session of Parliament:

First, the Japanese government announced five emergency decisive battle measures to be implemented swiftly at the Cabinet meeting on the 12th of this month, and re-examined the new national organization plan centered on the Imperial Rule Assistance Association (IRAA). In order to establish a strong political posture to strive for the victory of the Greater East Asia War, the "Special Committee for Establishing the National Posture for Certain Victory" of the IRAA passed a landmark motion to "establish a new national party" at the general meeting on the morning of the 17th. This is intended to more effectively mobilize the power of the people to cooperate with the government to complete the war. This point is expected to be enacted by this session of Parliament.

Second, the focus of the deliberations in this session of Parliament is on various urgent bills to adapt to the current decisive stage, especially the 27 bills submitted by the government to both houses, such as the amendments to the Pension Law, the Military Service Law, the Army Military Court Law, and the Navy Military Court Law, the Subsidy Law for Salaries of Active Youth School Staff, and the Wartime Financial Adjustment Law. The proposed 1.9 billion yen tax increase, the 22.2 billion yen general social budget, the special emergency supplementary budget, and temporary military expenses will all be used to demonstrate the "special attack spirit" of 110 million people in this session of Parliament.

Third, Prime Minister Koiso delivered a policy speech in Parliament on the 21st, providing detailed explanations on (1) strengthening the air defense system, (2) thoroughly increasing military production, (3) striving to increase food production and strengthen the self-sufficiency system, (4) strengthening the labor system and national labor mobilization, and (5) thoroughly transforming all materials into combat power. In addition, his statements on evacuating the population from large cities, promoting the construction of new ships, having military officers and civilians jointly shoulder the responsibility of defending the country, and strengthening the unity of the countries of Greater East Asia, are all sufficient to illustrate Japan's political方針to gather all its strength, strengthen its conviction, and complete the war. The future achievements of the Parliament will be immeasurable.

Japan's relations with the countries of Greater East Asia, especially with China, have also become a point of attention from all parties in this session of the Japanese Parliament. Prime Minister Koiso emphasized the strengthening of the unity of the countries of Greater East Asia, and in his policy speech, he stated the continental policy direction of "supporting production on the mainland" and "striving to enhance transportation capacity between Japan, Manchuria, and China." Foreign Minister Shigemitsu's speech also clearly indicated the determination to thoroughly implement Sino-Japanese cooperation in both political and economic terms, and to assist in the construction of a new China. This sincere expression is, of course, given even greater importance in our country's government and public sectors.

Since our country joined the war, although friendly relations between the two countries have been progressing, there are still inevitably things worth contemplating and carefully considering regarding the ideals and actual manifestations of both parties. We cannot help but have ardent expectations for the attention and discussion on China's problems in this session of the Japanese Parliament.

When Foreign Minister Shigemitsu answered the question from Mr. Kanemitsu Tsuneo on the 21st, he strongly stated that he is currently considering new economic policies to improve China's poverty problem. Although we have not seen Foreign Minister Shigemitsu explain the specific content of this new policy, the Tokyo telephone call reported by the Mainland News yesterday (23rd) indicated: (1) Rational operation of resource combat capabilities, (2) Countermeasures against inflation, and (3) Ensuring transportation capacity. It can be clearly seen here that the allied states ardently hope that we will fulfill our task of cooperating to complete the war and further build a new and prosperous China.

Standing from the position of the Chinese people, in terms of what we have felt most deeply since joining the war, nothing surpasses the issues of resources, currency, and transportation. But we also deeply know that the crux of all these problems lies in the stagnation and decline of agricultural and industrial production and the lack of political power to overcome all kinds of difficulties. Looking at China today, it is truly a "crisis-ridden situation." Therefore, what we must say to the allied states and the Chinese authorities today is that the only key to the success of the so-called "China's resource combat capabilities" and the so-called "new economic policy towards China" lies in saving China from its current state of poverty and decline. It must start with assisting in increasing production, and then we can talk about truly gathering combat power and cooperating to complete the war. However, in order to increase production and achieve realization, we must frankly review the pathological conditions of the past that have reduced production. We believe that it is more appropriate for Chinese people to handle the direct and indirect work of increasing production themselves, with Japanese people in an assisting role. While encouraging ourselves, we also express our sincere expectations for this session of Parliament of the allied states.

German War Report

Attacks by powerful German units in the above two areas have completed the defensive formation. After fierce fighting, the Soviet army has made progress on the eastern front of Oppeln. Intense fighting has begun southwest of Łódź and between Kalisz and Toruń. The pressure from the southwest of East Prussia towards the north by the Soviet army has increased. The Soviet attack in eastern East Prussia has expanded south of the Rominten Heath. The Soviet attacks between Friedland and Insterburg have all failed. In the above operations, the German 61st Infantry Division alone has destroyed 25 Soviet tanks. The Soviet army has broken through the German defense line between Insterburg and Kurisches Haff, and fierce fighting is underway.

Four Major Targets of the Soviet Offensive

Berlin, 23rd (Central News Agency) – Huitong News Agency reports: A German military spokesman pointed out that the Soviet winter offensive has four main strike targets: First, to attack Breslau and penetrate into Silesia. Second, to attack Posen and Brandenburg. Third, to advance towards Elbing. Fourth, to advance towards Königsberg. According to reports, defensive works have been constructed in the eastern and northeastern suburbs of the industrial area and west of Kempen, forming a line.

Successful German Defensive Battle

Berlin, 23rd (Central News Agency) – Huitong News Agency reports: Responsible German military sources stated last night that the German army is implementing countermeasures on the Upper Silesian border, marking the first time since the Soviet army launched its offensive. Regarding the success of the German defense in Upper Silesia, as stated in yesterday's German war report, the sources said that the German command's goal is to achieve the greatest military effect with the least amount of territory abandoned. It is very important that the Soviet army has been prevented from reaching its most important offensive target. The task of the German army is to protect the Upper Silesian industrial area with strong defenses, while at the same time crushing the Soviet plan to isolate East Prussia by advancing from the south to Danzig. The implementation of this task requires the sacrifice of some land. Although this phase has not yet ended, the battles in Upper Silesia and the southern border of East Prussia show that the Soviet advance has been partially repelled, and the success of the German defensive battle is considered the beginning of the solidification of the German defense line.

German Counterattack in Hungary Achieves Victory

Berlin, 23rd (Central News Agency) – Huitong News Agency reports: German armored units and infantry stormed into Stuhlweissenburg with whirlwind speed and are now pursuing enemy forces a few kilometers north of the city. This is the second major victory for the German army since the Soviet army broke into the Danube River south of Lake Platten in Hungary. The Soviet Union attempted to attack Vienna with 30 infantry divisions, 3 artillery divisions, 7 tank brigades, and 1 anti-aircraft artillery division, but failed. The German army launched an offensive on January 19, and the Soviet plan was shattered. Every village between the northern end of Lake Platten and Stuhlweissenburg has been fortified by the Soviet army, so the German army encountered strong resistance during the attack. When the German army captured the first line of defense, the ratio of German to enemy deaths was about 101 to 20 to 50. The scene of the Soviet retreat was no less tragic than the 1940 campaign in France. The number of shells piled up next to the German flat-trajectory guns and anti-aircraft guns shows the intensity of the resistance.

### German Southern Army on the Western Front Recaptures Hagenau; British and American Troops Prepare for a New Offensive

Berlin, 23rd (Central News Agency) – German news agency reports: The German army, in its offensive in the Vosges Mountains, broke into Hagenau on Monday.

Berlin, 23rd (Central News Agency) – Huitong News Agency reports: The war on the Western Front has now entered an interim phase. The large-scale American offensive at Ardennes has been relaxed since Friday, so there are only local battles there now. It is believed that there is an understanding between the British and Americans, to launch offensives on the eastern and western fronts simultaneously. However, while the Soviet army is fiercely attacking the Eastern Front, Eisenhower's offensive suddenly stopped. This is due to the success of Rundstedt's offensive in overturning the plans of the British and American armies. Eisenhower is currently preparing everything in military and political terms to launch a new offensive on the Western Front. To that end, he is currently reorganizing his First and Third Armies. A few days ago, General Patton's troops were seen withdrawing from Ardennes and being transferred to the Saar and south of Bitche, to carry out local offensives. Although the British Second Army's offensive in the Roermond triangle involves only five divisions, it appears to be a preparatory measure for Eisenhower's new offensive.

### Roosevelt-Churchill-Stalin Conference

May be Held on Soviet Territory

Stockholm, Sweden, 23rd (Central News Agency) – Huitong News Agency quotes the London "Daily Mail" as saying: The meeting between Roosevelt, Churchill, and Stalin may be held on Soviet territory and preparations are being accelerated.

Words Reflect the Heart

Lisbon, 23rd (Central News Agency) – German news agency reports, Washington news: Many important figures who listened to President Roosevelt's inaugural address on Saturday believe that the speech truly reflects the seriousness of Roosevelt's state of mind and attitude as he is about to confer with Churchill. The general tone of the speech indicates Roosevelt's determination to strive to achieve his ideal of peace, although he is also aware that he may not be able to reach a perfect state.

### South's Prime Minister in Exile Forced to Resign

Stockholm, Sweden, 23rd (Central News Agency) – German news agency reports, British Broadcasting Corporation news: The "Yugoslav" crisis caused by King Peter's refusal to accept the Subasic-Tito agreement has led to the resignation of the Subasic government. The successor to the position of Prime Minister may be Mr. Grol, a leader of the anti-Tito faction of the South in London and an opponent of the Subasic-Tito agreement.

### German Official Commentary on Soviet-Hungarian Armistice Agreement

Berlin, 23rd (Central News Agency) – Huitong News Agency reports: A German Foreign Ministry spokesman said that the only noteworthy aspect of the armistice agreement signed between Moscow and the illegal Hungarian government is that it is solely represented by the Soviet Union. According to the spokesman, after Horthy's illegal Hungarian government betrayed Germany, it originally hoped to conclude a treaty with Western countries. Therefore, it sent Eckhardt to the United States, Revesz to Sweden, and other personnel to Lisbon and Cairo. Now, as with Bulgaria and Romania, its hopes have been dashed. And in terms of the armistice agreement, the Soviet Union can do whatever it wants in Southeast Europe without external interference.

### Maritime Competition Between the United States and Britain

Stockholm, Sweden, 23rd (Central News Agency) – According to maritime news sources: The total number of ships owned by the United States and Britain is 41 million tons, of which Britain has 10 million tons and the United States has 31 million tons. Before the outbreak of this war, the ratio of maritime power between the United States and Britain was two to one. However, British maritime power is now far inferior to that of the United States. Taking advantage of the decline of British maritime power, the United States wants to occupy the top position in the world's maritime transport, a goal that is already evident in the current war. And the shipbuilding capabilities of the United States and Britain differ greatly. Given that the United States is more actively building ships, it can be seen that the future gap between the maritime powers of the United States and Britain will be even greater.

### Wallace's Transfer to U.S. Secretary of Commerce

Will Cause Internal Strife in the Democratic Party

Lisbon, 23rd (Central News Agency) – Huitong News Agency reports, Reuters dispatch: President Roosevelt's appointment of Wallace as Secretary of Commerce is likely to cause internal strife between the left and right wings of the Democratic Party. Wallace is the leader of the Democratic Party's liberal New Deal faction, while former Secretary of Commerce Jones is the backbone of the Democratic Party's conservative faction. The change of the Secretary of Commerce appears to be a victory for the New Deal faction, but Jones remains the President of the Reconstruction Finance Corporation, a government lending agency, and his influence in the business community is above any public or private lending agency in the country. Wallace's appointment as Secretary of Commerce must be approved by Congress. After taking office, he must also prevent the alliance between Republicans who support Jones and Democratic financiers from the southern states. The power of the Reconstruction Finance Corporation led by Jones is indeed above the Department of Commerce.

### Moine Assassination Case: The Murderer Sentenced to Hanging

Stockholm, Sweden, 23rd (Central News Agency) – German news agency reports, Cairo news: The Egyptian High Military Court formally sentenced the two murderers in the Moine assassination case to hanging yesterday, to be carried out within the next three weeks.

Commentary

### Reading Mayor Zhou's Proclamation to the Citizens

— Jiang Xianqi

January 15th was the auspicious occasion of the inauguration of Shanghai's Mayor Zhou and his senior cadres. Although I was not invited to attend the grand ceremony, I still went to the municipal government building at eleven o'clock that morning to express my heartfelt congratulations. However, I was ultimately blocked by the guards and unable to meet the newly appointed officials, and returned home with a copy of the "Proclamation to the Citizens."

The first paragraph of the "Proclamation to the Citizens" briefly explains the complexity, seriousness, and depravity of the current situation in Shanghai, as well as the process by which Mr. Zhou came to serve as mayor. Mr. Zhou tells us that after Acting Chairman Chen intended to entrust the affairs of Shanghai to him, many friends advised him to consider the difficulties of Shanghai's environment in the future and not to take on the burden and sacrifice himself in vain. However, he firmly believed that in this extraordinary period, one should not consider personal matters, and finally, under the orders of Acting Chairman Chen and the urging of his comrades, he resolutely took on the heavy responsibility! I remember Mr. Wang once said that "the peace movement is a work of entering hell and jumping into a fire pit." With the current situation so serious and the environment so difficult, Mr. Zhou's concurrent appointment as Mayor of Shanghai is naturally with the determination of "If I don't go to hell, who will? If I don't jump into the fire pit, who will?"

Indeed, "in such a situation and such an environment, even a heavenly deity with three heads and six arms would not be able to break the stalemate and improve the status quo." Shanghai is like a patient with "disease entered into the marrow," the accumulated germs of years have penetrated deep into the heart, and with the addition of external colds, the disease is even more serious. However, this patient is not dead yet, and this patient must not die, so we must find a way to save it in a situation where there is no way. If Western medicine doesn't work, we will switch to Chinese medicine; if acupuncture and medicine are ineffective, we will take decoctions again. Plasters for bruises and injuries are applied, and tonifying pills to replenish the center and benefit qi are swallowed. With such a fair and meticulous famous doctor as Mayor Zhou, plus Mr. Luo Junqiang, a "iron-fisted assistant" with魄力 and vitality who does what he says, to operate when needed and give injections when needed, I think Shanghai can be saved, and Shanghai has a solution!

The root cause of China's political inability to get on the right track can be summarized in one sentence: "selfishness and self-interest." Because there is "selfishness," there will be "chaos," and because of "chaos," the people will "suffer." Now Mayor Zhou has assured everyone that he and his cadres are all young and promising, with ideals and a sense of career. They are determined to "do a good job," their spirit is "public interest outweighs private interest, society comes before the individual," and they further emphatically stated: "Absolutely will not use their power and position to seek personal gain." They "are determined to lead by example, not to be corrupt, not to pervert the law, not to engage in malfeasance, and not to extort by trickery." This way of working is deeply aware of the past malpractices of Chinese politics, and this declaration is also aimed at the source of the disease in Chinese society. In the past, and even now, many of those in power have indeed failed to lead by example, "only allowing state officials to set fires, but not allowing the common people to light lamps," "only caring about personal enjoyment, and not caring about the life and death of the common people." It is even commonplace and too numerous to mention to use their positions to engage in corruption and abuse of power, and to oppress the common people. Mayor Zhou is insightful and has endured hardships. Since he can make such responsible guarantees to the citizens when he takes office, I think he will definitely be able to establish a style of integrity in a corrupt and degenerate society where life is oppressive and human desires run rampant.

The day after Mayor Zhou took office, I took a tram from the South Bund to Fook Hing Road and heard a lot of chatter from the "common people." It seems that everyone is paying attention to the inauguration of the new officials of the municipal government these days. The price of rice has fallen, and commodity prices have stopped rising, which shows that even in a bad social environment, people are still afraid of the sanctions of justice. A northerner on the tram said, "Mayor Zhou will definitely not be ambiguous about corrupt officials in the future. On the day before his inauguration, he specially pulled out a director of the Supervision Bureau under his jurisdiction and executed him by firing squad, which is to show his power to future corrupt people!" Another passenger said, "Isn't that right? Secretary-General Luo's way of doing things in Anhui is also very powerful! It is said that one of his captains beat a post office clerk, so he immediately took the captain to be shot. In the future, this group of people wearing uniforms in Shanghai must also be careful!"

Also, on another occasion, it seemed that someone was discussing Mr. Luo's speech: A lady said, "It is said that the treatment of the police will be increased several times in the future, but after being able to maintain their lives, they will not be allowed to extort the common people. The old and bad police will be eliminated, and all will be young and strong. Public officials in general must also be able to make a living, and whoever is corrupt will be in danger of being beheaded!"

——This is the voice of the real citizens!

——This is the expectation of the real citizens!

Travel Correspondence

### Sketches on the Road between Beijing and Shanghai

— Special Correspondent of This Newspaper, Danming

The train ticket prices have risen. At a time when the government authorities are trying to flatten commodity prices, the price of train tickets has actually risen by 140%. Even state-owned public utilities cannot help but be affected by commodity prices, and we can also see the degree of hardship in people's livelihoods in China today. It is said that when the authorities of the Ministry of Construction of the National Government approved China Railway's request for a price increase, they made it a condition that China Railway try to improve the current state of business. Therefore, although the reporter can remain silent about the previous hardships of the journey, after China Railway's price increase is implemented, when embarking on this journey that is like a devil's path again, I would like to report the truth to the readers.

Black Market Tickets Have Not Been Eliminated

Night trains have always been called "single-carrying trains." If I want to investigate the truth about the inside story of the station, this is a good attempt. Taking the train, the first hurdle is buying tickets. Every time the reporter passed the Eight Immortals Bridge on the tram in the evening and saw people carrying quilts in front of the travel agency, preparing to wait overnight to buy tickets early in the morning, I couldn't help but feel mixed emotions! "Could it be that there is still a black market to buy tickets?" I thought to myself. I went into the travel agency to buy a ticket. I was fortunate to have a few familiar staff members, so I didn't buy a black market ticket, but because of the exchange of tickets, it turned out that I lost 500 yuan. After buying the ticket, in order to see a friend, I walked into his office and heard a servant on the phone:

"The ticket has not been bought, because a place specializing in selling black market tickets in the Hardoon Building has been sealed."

"Well then, think of a way."

With that, the servant hurried out the door. Soon he returned and continued to speak on the telephone receiver:

"There is a way, but it will sell for three thousand yuan!"

Hearing this, I couldn't help but ask him: "Where does it cost three thousand yuan to go?" He said, "A third-class ticket to Wuxi." "Where can I buy black market tickets?" I asked.

"It is very difficult to buy black market tickets now," he replied to me. "Only people from China Railway are secretly peddling them through acquaintances. If you don't know this person, you have no way to buy them."

The China Railway authorities have recently been rectifying their operations, and evidence has been obtained here. However, it is clear that the efforts of the station alone are not enough to fundamentally eliminate black market tickets. Because after the reporter entered the station and asked his companions, although there were not many people buying black market tickets, it was not absolutely none. Now the black market price of a second-class ticket to Nanjing is close to seven or eight thousand yuan. May I ask, if the black market ticket price is not eliminated, will the significance of China Railway's price increase this time only help fuel the rise of the black market? In particular, it is said that because of this price increase, the price of rice in Shanghai has risen again these days!

The Scenery Before Punching Tickets

The second hurdle for taking the train is punching tickets. Usually, tickets are punched half an hour before the train departs, but because I am taking the night train, if you don't squeeze in the front, you won't be able to find a seat. It is okay not to sleep for one night, but it is impossible to stand upright all night. Therefore, most passengers go to the station as early as possible. Probably the night train from Shanghai to Nanjing is scheduled to depart at 10:05, but passengers have already arrived at the station to line up around 7:00. The reporter has taken the night train several times, so I have a lot of experience. On the evening of the 19th, I left home at 7:00 and took a rickshaw to the station. When I arrived at the station, it was not yet 8:00, but the first and second class ticket punching area was already crowded with people. So I lined up at the first and second class civil servant ticket punching area. Because I was bored, I talked with the people in line about their experiences of going out. According to several people who often travel back and forth between Shanghai and Bengbu, "The Zhabei Station used to be the most chaotic, but since former Governor Luo took charge, with the spirit of using heavy penalties in troubled times, it is now very different from the past." Therefore, they hope that Mr. Luo can have the same achievements after coming to Shanghai to serve as the secretary-general of the municipal government. The Shanghai Station now has a police station. Perhaps there will soon be extraordinary measures taken against all those who engage in malfeasance!

The situation of selling black market tickets at the station could not be seen with my own eyes because the ticket office was outside the station, but the scene of the black hats asking "single carriers" to buy passage was captured in my eyes. When the reporter was standing in line, there was a burst of noise, but I saw five people who looked like villagers and were carrying goods being driven out of the platform by Allied military police with whips. It turned out that they had first paid 500 yuan each to the black hats, so they entered the station first, but unexpectedly encountered the military police and were driven back. It was not easy to wait for the military police to leave before they limped back into the platform from the black hats. They were taking the slow train to Changzhou.

The people in the Beijing-Shanghai area all know the "black hat" name, and no one's heart does not beat when it is mentioned. Therefore, the reporter specially took a careful look at them today. It turned out that they were the staff of China Railway, some with armbands with the words "Guidance" written on them. They didn't look abhorrent, but when it came to punching tickets, their power was indeed amazing. They could arbitrarily ask the third-class passengers in line for money, and they could also open the iron bars of the ticket punching area to satisfy the "Yellow Fish Head," inviting the benefactors to walk into the platform, and then open the iron bars of the ticket punching area in the queuing area, ordering the passengers in line to step back, allowing the batch of benefactors to squeeze in the front. Therefore, the order became chaotic, and the later passengers kept crowding forward, which aroused the Allied station staff, who had to stand on the wall and command the black hats to maintain order with whips. At this time, the black hats were truly awe-inspiring, like executioners, raising their whips and dropping them, causing women to cry and children to scream, which was really unbearable to see.

"How cruel, how can they be so heartless?" Someone was discussing there.

Chatting in the Car with Single Carriers

When the bell rang and the ticket punchers punched the tickets, it could be said to be the most tense scene. The crowded situation at that time was even more difficult to describe. Especially because we stood until 9:30, suddenly a slow train entered the station, and the civil servant ticket punching area had to give way so that civil servants and Allied soldiers could exit the station. Therefore, the original queue was crowded beyond recognition. After the slow train passengers left, they lined up again, and the chaos of the order could be imagined. What's more, there were particularly many passengers today, and the ticket punching time was extended to 9:55, so people who didn't know when the train would depart were even more eager to be the first to punch their tickets. It was easy for the hospitable to squeeze out of the ticket punching area, so the reporter had to run quickly. However, when I ran to the first second-class carriage, I saw that the entrance was already packed with people. Fortunately, there was also a second-class military carriage, half of which was for passengers, and the reporter took a seat. Soon the people in line were completely on the carriage, but most of the women and children did not have seats, and there was simply no room for a foot in the carriage. The reporter was sitting next to a "single carrier." He was dressed in short clothes, wearing a velvet hat, and there was a hole in his cotton-padded jacket, which was obviously a single carrier. I asked him what he was carrying. He said it was sixty cartons of cigarettes. It turned out that what he was carrying was not rationed cigarettes, but Three-Six brand and other inferior goods. It is said that he earns 4,000 yuan each time he goes to Beijing, in addition to the second-class ticket. When he returns to Shanghai from Beijing, he brings pork or chicken, and when it is good, he can earn 10,000 or 20,000 yuan. He was originally a factory worker, but because the factory closed, he had to make a living by this. Unfortunately, he bought a joint ticket from Xiashi to Nanjing, but did not buy an express train ticket. Later, he was fined 2,900 yuan when he was caught checking tickets. At the same time, when the ticket inspector came, the Chinese conductor shouted for the third-class passengers to walk over, otherwise they would be fined more than 20,000 yuan! The reporter thought: Since China Railway is increasing ticket prices and also increasing fines, I wonder if they have also taken care of the comfort of passengers? The second-class carriage today is so crowded that there is no gap. Did they not have a limit on the number of tickets sold? If the number of tickets sold increases with the demand on the black market, what kind of state-owned enterprise is this?

Being a single carrier is not easy either. Because the reporter had nothing to do on the train, he chatted with those single carriers. It is said that they buy second-class tickets for several reasons: (1) They can avoid walking into the station from the fence, because there is a policeman at the entrance of the fence who wants to buy a passage for at least 100 yuan; (2) They can avoid being scoured by the black hats with "Guidance" armbands when queuing. If he sees that you have a lot of goods, he will open a "Yellow Fish Head," otherwise it will cost at least 200 yuan; (3) They can avoid being ripped off by the ticket puncher when punching tickets, which can save at least 100 or 200 yuan; (4) They can avoid being searched and extorted by the Chinese conductor with black hats and "police ride" "Yellow Hats" in the car. At the same time, the Allied conductors do not inspect in the third-class carriage, so those bad eggs can sell as much as they want, and sometimes there are inexplicable black hats who come up to rob things and extort money at other small stations. Therefore, this single carrier told me, "I would rather spend 1,500 yuan more!"

The Tension When Leaving the Station

There was nothing to say in the car overnight. The next morning at 9:30, we arrived at Xiaguan Station. When getting off the bus, the order became chaotic again, especially when approaching the ticket collection office. The inspection at the station has now been cancelled, but the ticket collectors have replaced the past inspectors in collecting money from single carriers. As long as you carry a lot of things and look like a single carrier, he will grab you and "fine" you. So, while collecting tickets, he talks about bargaining, making Nanjing Station lively again. Naturally, there are police officers helping to maintain order, but in short, it is all about legal tender. When the reporter left the ticket collection office, fortunately, I only had a briefcase in my hand, so I was not harassed. On the rickshaw entering the city, there were few pedestrians, and the air was relatively clear.

### Municipal Economic Bureau Establishes Policy Guidelines, Resolutely Punishes Illegal Merchants

After Director Xu of the Shanghai Municipal Economic Bureau took over, the important personnel in each department and section, as well as the stocks below, have been determined and commissioned separately. The articles of the organizational regulations have also been revised and submitted to the municipal government for approval and then submitted to the Executive Yuan for record. It also supervised all subordinates to be honest and clean, handle industrial and commercial registration, strengthen the organization of various industry associations, earnestly promote the movement of materials, manage and guide farmers, industry and commerce to strive to increase production, strictly manage illegal price increases, and strive to make Shanghai's overall economic development reasonable. At the same time, it will resolutely take strict measures against illegal merchants who hoard and speculate, and thoroughly investigate and punish them.

### Three Types of Extra Rice Rations to Be Sold Starting Today, Priced at 50 Yuan Per Sheng

The Goods Rationing Office recently decided on the issuance of one dou of Grade B Phase 9 extra rice rations, one dou of Grade D-1 Phase 9 extra rice rations, and 6.2 sheng of Grade D-2 Phase 9 extra rice rations. It is stipulated that sales will begin from the 24th to the 31st of this month, priced at 50 yuan per sheng. Holders of the above tickets should pay close attention.

### Special Rations Must Be Shipped By Deadline

Regarding the special allocation of flour to various noodle product merchants, the Municipal Flour and Bran Unified Distribution Office began to allocate and sell them at the beginning of this month, and it has been half a month. The original deadline was the 20th, but due to the continuous air raids, the bank's business hours were shortened, and transportation was inconvenient, so a small number of merchants did not have time to pay and ship the goods. The Unified Distribution Office, in consideration of the merchants' difficulties, temporarily decided to extend it to the 25th of this month. As of tomorrow, the deadline will expire. All those who have not paid and shipped the goods are limited to complete these procedures within today and tomorrow to avoid being out of date.

### Forged No. 37 Ration Card Discovered

The Municipal Goods Rationing Office, based on the No. 37 comprehensive ration card with Nos. 3092 and 3131 issued by the office and accepted by retailers, has recently discovered a forgery and the forgery organization has been seized by the police authorities. It is now being thoroughly investigated according to law, but it is feared that the forgery is still remaining outside and intended to be used, and the people will be deceived. In addition to sending a sample of the genuine certificate to each retail outlet and state-owned sales office for verification, it has also reported to the municipal government and sent a letter to the police bureau for secret investigation and arrest.

### Mahjong Tax to Be Suspended

Mayor Zhou of this city found in the handover documents that there was a matter of collecting entertainment taxes for playing cards. Because the matter was close to being annoying, he immediately ordered the suspension of the collection of this mahjong tax. All issued card tax licenses should be immediately recalled and invalidated. The municipal government ordered the Finance Bureau to handle the matter and announced it to the public. It is said that the authorities have been ordered to cooperate in the implementation.

### Intensified Collection of Underreported Income Tax

The Shanghai District Branch of the Income Tax Office of the Ministry of Finance previously stated that since the fiscal year 1944 has ended, many companies and factories still have not paid the first type of profit-seeking enterprise income tax for the fiscal year 1943. Since the profit-seeking income tax for the fiscal year 1944 is about to be levied, the bureau specially dispatched five major groups of collectors from the 4th of this month and led tax police to major roads to investigate whether each large and small company, factory, and line has declared and paid taxes. If it is found that they have not declared and paid taxes, they will be ordered to pay taxes in accordance with the regulations within one month (that is, before February 4). It is also learned that in order to increase tax revenue and unify taxation, the bureau will also implement the collection of temporary profit-seeking income tax on dog racing tracks. Negotiations are now underway, and the Yi Yuan authorities have been ordered to fill out and submit profit forms and declare and pay taxes on schedule.

### Special Pork Tax Will Be Collected Centrally

Since the change of the Director of the Finance Bureau of this city, the collection of various taxes has been actively reorganized. The special consumption tax on pork in this city was previously collected on behalf of various pork retailers. However, there are inevitable omissions and unclear procedures. It has been decided that the slaughterhouse will collect the tax centrally from the 25th of this month. Afterwards, various pork retailers will no longer have to pay separately. The special tax not paid before the 25th of this month will still be collected by the original collection agency to collect from the retailers, and they shall not escape.

### Propaganda Office Convened Theatrical Community Yesterday For a Discussion, Determined to Strictly Prohibit Illegal Demands From Staff

Liu Dexuan, Director of the Municipal Propaganda Office, convened those responsible for Peking opera and spoken drama in this city at the conference hall of the Propaganda Office at 2:30 pm yesterday (23rd) for a discussion, with 15 people attending. Director Liu made a detailed statement on the past malpractices of the Propaganda Office's work on the spot. In the past, due to the examination of scripts and registration, it was very easy to establish connections with all parties, so that there were even illegal demands. For example, bad dramas were approved for examination due to bribery. In the future, the Propaganda Office staff would ask for subsidies from the outside world and forcibly set free viewing positions. There are too many things to mention. In the future, the above-mentioned things will be strictly prohibited from happening again. According to reports, the Propaganda Office staff have fixed living expenses, and illegal demands should be stopped urgently, and it is hoped that all walks of life will report them. It is said that the Propaganda Office will continue to convene those in charge of Yue opera, Shen opera, and miscellaneous drama in this city tomorrow (24th) for a discussion.

### Shanghai Indian Community Celebrates Bose's Birthday

Chairman Bose of the Provisional Government of Azad India celebrated his 48th birthday yesterday (23rd). Sha Hai, the leader of the Indian National Army in this city, jointly organized a grand tea party with various overseas Chinese on the eighth floor of the Cathay Hotel to show their celebration. Mayor Zhou and Secretary-General Luo (represented by Counselor Pan Da) and Director Liu of the Propaganda Office also attended. Important personnel from the Allied embassies, consulates, and army, navy, and media authorities in Shanghai also attended to congratulate. It is also reported that Sha Hai, the leader of the Indian National Army in Shanghai, also issued a proclamation to the public yesterday, saying that all ethnic groups in East Asia should strengthen unity, devote all their efforts to eliminate their long-time enemies Britain and the United States, to complete the war, and ensure the peace and restoration of East Asia.

### Various Circles Schedule Memorial Service for Mr. Yamashita

Mr. Yamashita Kikusaburo, former cabinet advisor and famous entrepreneur of Japan, passed away in Japan on December 13 of last year. The Shanghai branch of Yamashita Steamship Co. and the Shanghai branch of Yamashita Mining Co. specially scheduled a memorial service at the Industry and Commerce Friendship Association Hall of the Bund Xingya Building on the afternoon of January 30, starting at 4:00 pm for the seventh anniversary of his death. Mr. Yamashita has a very close relationship with China, and dignitaries from all walks of life in this city will go to pay their condolences at that time.

### The Attitude of Train Ticket Sellers Needs to Be Corrected Urgently

The Shanghai Municipal Traffic Company has made every effort to restore various means of transportation in this city, and all tram and trolleybus lines have been gradually restored, which is convenient for the citizens. However, drivers and ticket sellers on various tram lines sometimes behave unreasonably towards passengers. Although there are many passengers waiting for the bus at various stations, empty buses often pass by, allowing only one or two passengers to board, while other passengers are left standing. Such situations are often discovered, which is truly detrimental to the good intentions of the Municipal Traffic Company to maintain public transportation. It is hoped that the company authorities will pay attention.

### Reporters' Regular Meeting to Resume This Week

The Municipal Propaganda Office recently decided to resume the reporters' regular meeting starting this Saturday. The time is scheduled for 2:00 pm, and the address is on the second floor of the Municipal Government. At this reporters' regular meeting, the Director of Propaganda will attend to answer questions from the city's press corps on propaganda work.

### Raising the Amount of Private School Establishment Funds

The Municipal Bureau of Education, considering the high rise in prices in recent years, felt that the amount of establishment funds for private secondary schools, as well as the flexible measures for raising funds promulgated by the Ministry of Education and Youth Affairs around the years 1933 and 1940, were no longer applicable in the current environment. Therefore, it specifically drafted opinions and submitted them to the Ministry of Education for approval. It has now been ordered to approve an increase in the original amounts, namely, the establishment fund for junior high schools to be 300,000 yuan, and for senior high schools to be 500,000 yuan. To facilitate fundraising for the schools, they may still refer to the flexible measures for school establishment funds promulgated in 1940 and be allowed to raise funds in installments. Those running secondary schools will have something to follow.

### Youth in District One Trained as Cadre Personnel

After two weeks, the training class will hold a graduation ceremony, and subsequent sessions will continue on schedule.

### Health Association Promotes Tuberculosis Prevention Checkups

The Chinese Health Association, in view of the current difficult times and the hardship of general life, recognizes that the spread of tuberculosis is becoming increasingly rampant. According to recent statistical results, more than 20 percent of the population suffers from latent tuberculosis, which has a significant impact on public health. To meet the urgent needs of society, the association is promoting X-ray checkups for tuberculosis prevention, in order to popularize early diagnosis, prevent problems before they occur, and achieve the goals of saving medical expenses and providing relief to the poor and sick. The preferential vouchers for the X-ray checkups are calculated at a half-price of 500 yuan and have been distributed to leaders from all walks of life in order to jointly promote the eradication of tuberculosis and protect public health. After all, the cost of treatment for one person is ten or a hundred times the cost of prevention. The more difficult life becomes, the more prevention is needed. If we can eliminate latent patients and complete the work of tuberculosis prevention, it will truly be a public benefit. All proceeds from checkups this week will be donated to the Shen Xin Er Bao student loan fund. Association address: 996 Jing'an Temple Road, Majestic Building.

### Establishing a Representative Organ of the Citizens: The Municipal Council

— Lan Yan

At this critical juncture of the war, officials and the people should unite as one and cooperate closely to increase strength and overcome difficulties. We regret to see that in Shanghai, a city with a population of five million and the political, economic, and cultural center of the country, there is no organ representing the people. On the other hand, to win over the people, it is necessary to implement a government close to the people. To implement a government close to the people, it is necessary to respect public opinion. The way to respect public opinion is none other than to value public discourse and establish organs of public opinion. Mr. Zhou Fohai has now taken over as the mayor of this city and will certainly bring a new approach to municipal administration. We urgently hope that a representative organ of the people of the whole city—the Municipal Council—can be established. I remember that as early as 1931, the National Government promulgated the organizational law of the Municipal Council, but for various reasons, the cities were slow to establish it, but to this day, it is still felt to be urgently needed.

Undeniably, there are many gaps between officials and the people today. When the authorities issue a decree, the people, not understanding the intention of the authorities, may even misunderstand the good intentions of the authorities, or this decree may not fully conform to the general customs of the people, so that although the people do not actively oppose it, they passively fail to implement it effectively, which will certainly hinder the administration of the authorities. Not long ago, the municipal government organized a rice registration for the distribution of goods, and most citizens thought that this was a prelude to the authorities' forced purchase, so most of them avoided it, and very few went to register. This is because officials and the people cannot cooperate closely. To unite officials and the people as one, there must be an organ representing the people.

In the era of the Public Works Department, the Chinese Ratepayers' Association could be said to be a disguised municipal council, and when the concession was recovered, the association was abolished accordingly. Later, a Municipal Advisory Committee was established, which was also a representative organ of the citizens, but in substance it was not a municipal council, and many good suggestions made by the committee in the past have not been fully realized.

Regarding the organization of the Municipal Council, I have three humble opinions:

First, regarding the number of councilors, assuming that the city has a population of five million, according to the organizational law, there should be 110 councilors. This number is appropriate. In fact, it may not be possible to directly elect the councilors by the citizens, but the authorities may select them, and it is necessary to recruit leaders from all walks of life, various experts, and those who have true talent and learning and noble character to serve.

Second, the Municipal Council has the power to resolve all municipal administrative facilities, but according to the current situation, special attention must be paid to (1) matters concerning the reorganization of municipal financial revenue, the raising of municipal public bonds, and other matters that increase the burden on citizens; (2) matters concerning the livelihood and relief of citizens; (3) matters concerning the promotion of municipal education and other cultural matters; (4) matters concerning municipal budget decisions; (5) matters concerning the operation of municipal public property and public business.

Third, the Municipal Council is not a government office, but a people's organization, and it must stand in a detached position and strive to avoid all formalism and empty talk.

We sincerely hope that the Municipal Council will be established today.

### Stimulating "Mutual Aid" and "Compassion" Wishing for Swift Assistance from Those in Society with Resources

In modern times, one cannot be solely concerned with self-cultivation, let alone only concerned with profit and forgetting public benefit. Society is a whole. If only one person becomes rich and extravagant, while the masses live in hardship, lacking clothing and food, forming a state of unequal wealth and uneven happiness, what kind of society is that? The masses are trapped in a dire situation, while I leisurely enjoy myself, without expressing compassion or making plans for mutual assistance; such a person is simply a cold-blooded animal, and we do not believe that he has a bright future. Therefore, we often advise the generally wealthy and noble people in the current environment: to sponsor social welfare more, to provide more relief to the poor masses, in order to fulfill the supreme compassion of mankind. Taking the scholarship movement as an example, is it not a cause promoted based on the psychology of "mutual aid" and "compassion"? Therefore, its effectiveness also depends entirely on the degree of this psychology among those with resources in society. The results of this "special fundraising" are certainly not bad, but not so good either! The start of school for all schools is only seven days away, and the fundraising goal is still far off. We are extremely apprehensive and anxious for the five thousand impoverished students! We hope that benevolent gentlemen will quickly provide assistance, generously donate, and accumulate immeasurable merit!

Zhi Zhong Donates Full Tuition Waivers

Zhi Zhong Girls' Middle School, located at the intersection of Datong Road and Dahua Road, is known for its comprehensive management. Recently, in response to the "special fundraising" for the scholarship fund in this newspaper and the scholarship fund specially set up by Anhua Bank on Shanxi Road, it has established five full tuition waiver slots each for senior high school and junior high school. Female students who live near the school and are in the same grade (starting in the fall semester) and whose families are impoverished and who wish to transfer to the school can register with us first for recommendation. Ten full tuition waiver slots for junior and senior high school students are equivalent to waiving 200,000 yuan in tuition and fees. The school's enthusiasm for helping students is truly admirable. We hope that other schools will follow suit to maximize the effectiveness of scholarship assistance. Society will be fortunate.

Xingzhong Boy Scouts Fundraise for Scholarships

A letter from the Xingzhong Elementary and Middle School Boy Scout Fundraising Team states: "Dear Sirs, We have come to sell newspapers and fundraise for scholarships to help impoverished students, benefit society, and cultivate talents for the country. The results are obvious and deeply admirable. Boy Scouts are based on serving society. Our team, inspired by this righteous cause, immediately organized a fundraising team, and with the support of enlightened parents and enthusiastic people from all walks of life, we have raised 200,450 yuan, which will be distributed to the Xin Shen Er Bao newspapers specifically for scholarship loans. These meager contributions are to show our small amount of support. We hope that influential people in society will generously sympathize and assist in promoting this cause. We are extremely grateful."

Three Brothers Jointly Form Filial Piety Team

Mr. Pan Zhiquan of Jianyuan Xingxian Company wrote: "Your newspaper is fundraising for the eighth scholarship fund, and I believe that contributing to education is very meaningful. Therefore, in addition to donating to our hometown schools every year, we also donate to the Rescue Out-of-School Volunteer Team run by Xinwen Bao every time. I have always admired your newspaper's active efforts in running the scholarship fund and should do my best to support it. I am now providing a check for 50,000 yuan, which is a joint donation from Pan Zhiquan, Pan Zhiheng, and Pan Yizhi, three brothers, and is named the Filial Piety Team. This small amount of money is to fulfill our obligations. I hope you will accept it and appreciate our intentions."

Wanlan Girls' High School Reduces Tuition Fees

Wanlan Middle School in this city was founded by enthusiastic educators and is very serious about relief efforts. This semester, in view of the difficulty for students to enter higher education, it has specifically lowered tuition fees. Junior high school tuition is only 10,000 yuan. It is also heard that the school offers preferential treatment to impoverished and outstanding students and has established many fee reduction and half-fee scholarships. Impoverished students with excellent academic performance can apply for registration. Students living nearby can also come directly to the school to submit documents and be admitted without examination. The school will start on February 2nd and classes will begin on the 5th. The school address is located inside the Shanghai Art College on Qiancaishi Road.

Major Manufacturers Donate Goods

Mr. Qiu Da Jun donated a woolen shirt. Zhengde Condensed Milk Factory donated six cups of Zheng brand sugarcane milk. Deng Yikang Sugar Factory donated five catties of white sugar. Other factories are still in contact separately, and we hope that enthusiastic manufacturers will donate goods automatically. The address of the bazaar is Room 302, YMCA, 8 Immortals Bridge, telephone number 4040.

Clinic Fee Revenue Used for Scholarships

A letter from the Foguong Sanatorium states: "Dear Sirs, Our hospital's Department of Psychiatry uses methods such as meditation, diet, guidance, and hypnosis to treat insomnia, neurasthenia, kidney deficiency, and various neurological symptoms. In order to respond to your newspaper's scholarship movement, we have decided that from the 22nd to the 28th of this month, all income from psychiatric outpatient clinic fees will be used to subsidize scholarships. Outpatient hours are from 2:00 PM to 5:00 PM. The address is 123 Lantian Road (Masnan Road). Please publish these two notices in the newspaper so that patients can recover their health early and subsidize student loans. We are extremely grateful."

### Work Report of the Municipal Winter Relief Committee

The Shanghai Special Municipality Winter Relief Committee has budgeted 260 million yuan for this year's winter relief expenses. The sources are (A) 200 million yuan allocated from the National Government's temporary relief treasury bonds (not yet received), (B) 10 million yuan allocated by the National Commercial Control General Association from the cotton cloth distribution profits of the previous year, with more than 4 million yuan still available, which will soon be allocated to the committee for use. (D) 50 million yuan donated by the Shanghai Citizens' Welfare Association. The funds were originally intended for poverty relief work such as operating low-priced grocery stores. The funds were raised from all walks of life and have now been allocated to the committee. The committee is currently organizing three temporary relief efforts: (1) Operating nine soup kitchens, which can provide porridge for a total of 9,000 people per day. Porridge distribution began on December 25th of last year and has been ongoing for one month, and will continue for another month. (2) Operating three shelters, which are currently being actively prepared and will soon begin accepting people. (3) According to the committee's clothing distribution plan, the committee requested the municipal government to consult the Executive Yuan to instruct the Commercial Control Association to allocate 2,720 bolts of cotton cloth and 250 piculs of cotton. This has been approved, and the cotton cloth has been received. The cost is estimated at more than 22 million yuan at the military and police allocation price. However, cotton could not be allocated for the cotton item for the time being, so we had to purchase seed cotton, which costs 20,000 yuan per picul, totaling 7.5 million yuan. It has now been handed over to contractors for urgent production. As soon as it is produced, it will be distributed immediately. It is expected that it can be fully distributed before the Lunar New Year. The above three items are temporary relief efforts, costing about 40 million yuan. The remaining 200 million yuan will be used to carry out active relief work, such as student loans for impoverished students, small loans, and relief for hidden poverty. However, it has not yet been approved by the committee and will be discussed at a meeting after all funds have been collected.

(Another News) The Shanghai Special Municipality Winter Relief Committee's Clothing Distribution Plan is tentatively as follows: The quantity includes 5,000 sets of large-size cotton clothing, 2,000 sets of medium-size cotton clothing, 3,600 sets of small-size cotton clothing, and 3,000 pieces of women's cotton robes, totaling 13,600 sets/pieces. The distribution area is limited to within the jurisdiction of this city. The locations will be determined separately on a temporary basis. The distribution agencies will be jointly organized by the committee and the Municipal Social Welfare Bureau or entrusted to other charitable organizations. Distribution standards: (A) The elderly, weak, disabled, and those without hobbies, (B) Orphans, widows, and widowed husbands without the ability to support themselves, (C) Impoverished low-wage earners with many children, (D) Those in shelters who have no cotton clothing to keep warm.

### Hongren Hospital's Year in Review

— Wang Yimin

In the past year, Hongren Hospital was constantly plagued by shortages, either running out of rice at the beginning of the month or coal by the fifteenth. One day it was the electricity being cut off, and the next it was the gas being shut down. Other matters, like the endless paperwork, filling out forms, and submitting reports, were secondary. The result was utter exhaustion, leaving them with no choice but to let things take their course. Despite these difficult circumstances, they somehow managed to struggle through the year with every ounce of strength they had. In that year, they saved 3,369 young lives, treated 9,039 hospitalized patients (both surgical and non-surgical), provided outpatient care to 47,503 individuals, and attended to 871 people injured on the streets and sent by the police. They also provided examinations for over 1,000 students with scholarships from the Shen Bao and Xin Shen Bao newspapers. Indirectly and directly, they assisted over 40 doctors from St. John's University and 18 nurses. This is the hospital's small contribution to society.

They managed to survive the difficulties of 1944, but who knows if they can escape the misfortunes of 1945? Today, the hospital can be said to have reached a dead end, truly in a state where it cannot close nor remain open. Having once relieved the illnesses and suffering of others, it is now itself plagued by a multitude of ailments, beyond remedy. The reason for this is undoubtedly the influence of both money and supplies. The seven necessities for a hospital are firewood, rice, oil, salt, medicine, water, and electricity. For the first four, one must have considerable power to be able to purchase them at will on the black market. But the hospital is not a producer; it is a consumer. It daily takes its limited income to compete with the endless rise of prices, ultimately resulting only in a feeling of helplessness. As for gas, water, and electricity, these are another problem altogether. In recent years, there has been a shortage of coal, leading to insufficient gas, water, and electricity supplies. The hospital's allocation has been decreasing daily. Today, many important functions have long been suspended, and when they are occasionally carried out, heavy fines are imposed. In addition, the number of patients has been increasing daily, making it impossible to cope. These two pressures are tightening day by day, leaving the hospital unable to breathe. If, unfortunately, an incident occurs and the injured come swarming in, one can only find the hospital as empty as a fishmonger's stall with dried-up fish. Therefore, for the sake of the hospital itself, it would be best to close its doors and live off its reserves, so it can survive for a little while longer. The hospital is established for society and should sacrifice itself for society. Originally, society cannot exist without hospitals, and hospitals cannot survive without society, but this close relationship has become detached in recent years. The hospital continues to serve society, but society has forgotten about the hospital due to other important issues. Currently, many hospitals in Shanghai are faltering, facing immense difficulties. It can only be hoped that the government will consider the safety of the patients, the future need for hospitals, and establish concrete and effective preferential measures for the prioritized allocation of water and electricity.

### Child Prodigy Weilaqiaosi Qiaozhi Holds Piano Benefit Concert

Date: February 6th, 5:00 PM
Location: Lyceum Theatre

A philanthropist, seeing the increasing number of refugees and orphaned children in the city in need of relief, initiated a piano concert. They specially engaged the piano prodigy Weilaqiaosi Qiaozhi to perform. The proceeds from ticket sales will be donated to various charitable organizations, using the funds from the child's artistic talents to help children in distress. This glorious act is worthy of praise. The program performed by the child prodigy Qiaozhi consists of world-renowned pieces, as well as compositions of his own. The child's two sisters will also accompany him on stage. One, Weilaqiaosi Shafei, is ten years old this year, and the other, Weilaqiaosi Meiling, is eight and a half years old. Both are known as piano masters. This program will feature a trio performance by the children, making it an unprecedented event in Shanghai. On that day, 95 tickets will be offered as donations to this newspaper's scholarship fund and other charitable causes. They are priced at 5,000, 2,000, and 1,000 yuan respectively, and will be sold by this newspaper's Social Service Department starting today. We hope music lovers and philanthropists will enthusiastically purchase tickets and participate in this great event.

### Shanghai Epidemic Hospital Launches Fundraising Campaign

Shanghai Epidemic Hospital, located at 25 Xizang Road, has 72 free beds year-round, providing free medical care, meals, and year-round free medical consultations and medicine to the poor and sick. During the summer epidemic season, outpatient services are completely free. In the past year, the hospital's medical work included 53,815 outpatient visits, of which 41,016 were free, and 22,430 inpatient admissions, of which 12,104 were free. The hospital's income was over 15,370,000 yuan, of which over 7,170,000 yuan was from donations. Expenditures were over 15,660,000 yuan, resulting in a deficit of over 293,000 yuan. Currently, the hospital's funds are depleted, and its relief work for the poor and sick cannot be maintained and is on the verge of collapse. At this critical juncture, it has no choice but to appeal to the public for assistance. It is expected that this year's expenses will increase three or four times compared to last year. Therefore, it is launching a fundraising campaign with a target of 20,000,000 yuan (which will only cover expenses for six months). It is deeply hoped that people from all walks of life will be charitable and generously donate so that this target can be reached. It would be most fortunate if, at the end of this old lunar year, people would divert their customary social spending to help the hospital, and if businesses and manufacturers would allocate a portion of their profits to donate funds, thereby benefiting the poor and sick, and contributing to society. Surely the merit would be immeasurable!

### Elementary School Winter Vacation In-Service Training Begins with Great Success

The elementary school teachers' winter vacation in-service training program, organized by this newspaper, held its opening ceremony at Shanghai Women's Middle School the day before yesterday (the 21st) at 2:00 PM. A total of over two hundred elementary school teachers attended, creating a grand occasion. The chairman first gave an opening speech, stating: "Education in Shanghai has declined in quality in recent years. The main reason is that teachers live a poor life, work too hard, and have no energy for further study. However, education is a century-long plan for the nation and cannot be neglected. This newspaper has repeatedly held vacation in-service training programs to supplement their shortcomings, improve the level of teachers, and increase teaching efficiency. Everyone should work harder, devote themselves to children's education, and live up to their sacred mission." Then, Dr. Tan Tiankai gave a lecture on "The Yan-Li School of Thought," and Mr. Wei Wuchou spoke on "The Self-Cultivation of Elementary School Teachers," with many insightful and moving words. Finally, educator Mr. Shi Renfu spoke on "Elementary School Moral Education," and Mr. Shen Baiying spoke on "Kindergarten and Arithmetic Teaching," with concise arguments and detailed explanations. The atmosphere at the meeting was harmonious. The meeting adjourned at 4:30 PM.

### Responding to Midwifery

A letter from the Class A students of the Huimin Advanced Midwifery Vocational School states: "We are writing to inform you that as the end of the semester approaches and graduation is imminent for the students in this class, we originally planned to hold a tea party to commemorate the occasion. However, the teachers believed that in these extraordinary times, it is unnecessary to spend so much and instructed us not to hold one. In addition to our gratitude, the students each donated 1,000 yuan, totaling 12,000 yuan, and sent it to your office. Please allocate it to the Huimin maternity subsidy fund, to provide some assistance in providing free delivery services to poor pregnant women. This would not only put the students at ease, but the teachers would also approve. We are very grateful for your trouble."

### Saving Transportation Fees to Help the Poor

Mr. Chen Dimin wrote in a letter: "Considering that poverty and sickness are the greatest suffering in life, I have specially saved the transportation fees from the past year, totaling 5,000 yuan, and delivered them to your office to be used to help the poor. I know that this is a drop in the bucket, but it is a token of my intentions."

### Ciyou Association's Fundraising Still Hopes for Continued Efforts from All Sectors

According to the China Ciyou Association, the association received continued donations from all sectors over the past two days, totaling 306,300 yuan. Among them, Mr. Liu Jihan, a member of the association, raised 150,000 yuan, and his enthusiasm for charity is deeply appreciated. However, the association's fundraising campaign has lasted for two months, and the fundraising results are still far from the goal of 10,000,000 yuan. It is hoped that all sectors will continue their efforts and generously donate large sums of money so that the association's fundraising can be concluded as soon as possible, which will surely greatly benefit children. If you would like to donate, you can send it directly to the association (Zhonghui Building, No. 28, Da Shanghai Road), or this newspaper's Social Service Department can also collect it on your behalf. If you would like to donate by phone, please call 82273, and the association will send someone to collect it with a receipt.

### Fuyou Orphanage Urgently Needs Support, Hoping All Sectors Will Generously Contribute

Since the Shanghai Fuyou Orphanage began its fundraising campaign, two weeks have passed. Although it has received enthusiastic support from people in all sectors of society, it is still far from reaching its target. Lin Kanghou, the commander of the orphanage's fundraising team, and Ding Fubao, the chief of staff, in order to promote the campaign fully, sent letters to all sectors to appeal for support and led the team leaders to actively fundraise. Shen Yongkang, the deputy commander, specially solicited donations from friends and relatives in Hangzhou and Songjiang, raising a total of 260,000 yuan. His arduous travel is admirable. It is hoped that charitable individuals, adhering to the principle of loving children and caring for the young, will generously donate to complete the 10,000,000 yuan target so that the orphanage's educational endeavors will not be interrupted. How fortunate that would be!
