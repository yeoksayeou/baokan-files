### The Third Grand Review of Youth, Chairman Chen Personally Gives Admonition, Thousands of Chinese and Japanese Representatives Display Vigorous Spirit

Nanjing, 5th (Central News Agency) – The third National Youth Grand Review was solemnly held at the Youth Hall parade ground at 9:00 AM on the 5th, which was Youth Day of the Republic of China. A grand reviewing stand was erected in the center, with a huge portrait of the Founding Father and the national flags of China and Japan hanging above it. The stand's front was filled with third Grand Review emblems and small flags, fluttering in the wind with a vigorous spirit. Starting at 8:00 AM, over three thousand people, including representative teams from various provinces and cities, military training students from Beijing, youth league members, and Japanese youth representatives, entered the field in an orderly fashion and stood in formation. Honorary chairmen Chu Minyi, Li Shengwu, Xiao Shuxuan, and Zhou Xuechang, as well as guests Hu Yukun, Zhao Zunyue, Chen Jun, Zhou Longxiang, Yang Kuiyi, Li Ouyi, He Bingxian, Shen Erqiao, and Lu Runzhi, totaling more than twenty people, arrived, along with foreign guests including Japanese Ambassador to China, Mr. Tani, and officials led by the Manchurian Ambassador Mr. Li. Acting Chairman Chen personally inspected the review and delivered an admonition. At precisely 9:00 AM, the military band played, respectfully welcoming Acting Chairman Chen. Guided by an usher, all the reviewing officers ascended the platform, marking the beginning of the grand review. After the general commander reported the number of people being reviewed, Acting Chairman Chen and other reviewing officers and guests toured the field for a week. This was followed by a march-past, with each team marching forward in an orderly manner. The order of the procession was led by the Chinese representative team, followed by the Japanese representative team, the Beijing military training student youth band, youth teams from various schools, students from agricultural training institutes, and representative teams from various provinces and cities, including North China, Zhejiang, Shanghai, Jiangsu, Huaihai, Anhui, and Northern Jiangsu. The entire group marched in synchronized steps with high spirits. After the march-past, Chinese youth representatives respectfully presented a flag to Acting Chairman Chen as a tribute. The flag was embroidered with the six characters "Long Live the Supreme Commander." Chairman Lin received the flag and presented it to Acting Chairman Chen, who then delivered a sincere admonition to everyone. His words were full of encouragement, deeply moving all who listened. Finally, the entire group sang the Youth League song and shouted national slogans, concluding the ceremony at around 11:00 AM.

### Love and Respect Each Other, Build a New East Asia, The Original Text of Acting Chairman Chen's Admonition

Nanjing, 5th (Central News Agency) – The original text of Acting Chairman Chen's admonition at the Third National Youth League Grand Review is as follows: Today is the 34th Youth Day, and we are also holding the Third National Youth League Grand Review. Thousands of energetic youth representatives from all over the country are gathered on this square, and we are also honored to have youth representatives from our allied nation, Japan, participating. This fully demonstrates the organization and strength of Chinese youth in China. I am extremely gratified. In the history of the Chinese revolution, youth have left behind brilliant achievements. Now, in the process of the revolution, we are encountering unprecedented difficulties. The fate of the motherland hangs by a thread. To overcome these difficulties, rescue and revitalize the motherland, and ultimately liberate and stabilize East Asia, we must have the sincere unity of the entire nation, dedicating all our manpower and resources to the country. Youth are the backbone of society, and they must first practice the work of revitalizing China and protecting Asia, leading the people in practicing the work of revitalizing China and protecting Asia. Recently, the national movement to advocate for unity and national salvation has been vigorously developing. The youth's movement for unity and national salvation is also vigorously developing. All youth across the country, whether in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Guangdong, Guangxi, Sichuan, Zhili, Hebei, Gansu, or Shaanxi, are all compatriots of the Republic of China, all descendants of the Yellow Emperor, and all love their motherland. Only the communists betray the country, kill compatriots, deceive the people into deep suffering, and implement red policies. We must launch a struggle against communism and rescue the youth and compatriots under the tyranny of the communists. The late Chairman Wang advocated for the New National Movement and considered the youth movement as the focus of the New Movement's work, organizing and training the nation's citizens and youth to complete the great cause of the national revolution under the banner of the Three Principles of the People. Since the passing of the late Chairman Wang last year, the international situation has been so treacherous, and the domestic situation has been so chaotic. I hope that the nation's youth will stand firm in their positions, train themselves more, enrich themselves, understand the importance of their responsibilities, strengthen their organizations, and fulfill the legacy of the Founding Father and the late Chairman Wang, building a bright and brilliant Republic of China. I further hope that the youth of China and Japan, and the youth of all parts of East Asia, will love each other, respect and understand each other, and work together to build a free and liberated New East Asia.

### Chongqing Kuomintang Convenes the Sixth National Congress

Central News Agency Report – According to information from Chongqing, the Chongqing Kuomintang convened its Sixth National Congress on May 5th. The main agenda of this congress is to decide on the convocation of the National Assembly on November 12th of this year and to approve the draft constitution.

### Sketch of Prime Minister Suzuki

When the important task of forming a cabinet fell to General Kantaro Suzuki, he was burdened with the heavy responsibility of the Privy Council President. At the time, there was a real lack of respect, with some people expressing uneasy voices saying, "Is he still standing at the forefront of the nation with his seventy-nine-year-old body?" No one but a man of utmost sincerity and dedication could shoulder the burden of Japan's current predicament. Only when the Japanese people realized that General Suzuki was such a person did they feel relieved. The old prime minister, General Kantaro Suzuki, shouldering the burden of the Japanese situation, how has he been striving since forming the cabinet? What supports him is the heartfelt support of Japan's 100 million people who want to lead this war to victory, the seventy-nine-year-old General Kantaro Suzuki.

The Prime Minister's Style

Anyone who has met General Kantaro Suzuki will feel that he is not a politician for the masses. He is neither so-called "of the masses" nor a "politician," but a true general. What is most endearing about him since taking office as prime minister is this point. In the past, there was no opportunity to connect with the public, so how to touch the hearts of the people and how to grasp the voices of the people after taking office as prime minister has become a point of deep contemplation for Prime Minister Suzuki. This is what people close to Mr. Suzuki say. Prime Minister Suzuki is quite willing to listen frankly to the opinions and requests of the people. Since forming the cabinet, Prime Minister Suzuki has been quietly and steadily moving forward.

The first time General Suzuki appeared on the streets after becoming prime minister was to inspect the disaster area of ​​Tokyo on April 15. At that time, he only brought a secretary. During the air raid on the night of April 13, the area near the prime minister's private residence in Koishikawa was turned into a sea of ​​fire. Thanks to the resolute firefighting activities of people who admired the prime minister and police officers, the prime minister's residence and its surrounding area were preserved in the vast fire zone, but it was once extremely dangerous. At that time, General Suzuki was in an open space in Otsuka, mixed in with a group of citizens of the capital, encouraging each other and sheltering in air-raid shelters. At this time, incendiary bombs were falling like rain, and no one knew that the old man was the prime minister, until a teacher from a national school shouted: "Ah, isn't that Mr. Suzuki!" Everyone then recognized him.

That night, Prime Minister Suzuki certainly did not sleep all night, but at 4:30 AM on the 14th, he went to the official residence as usual to work, and he was even busier than usual. The broadcast that night was also Prime Minister's own idea. After the broadcast, he felt that it was not enough, so there was the tour of the disaster area the next day. When leaving the official residence, the Prime Minister said: "I really want to send some gifts to the disaster victims!" But the prime minister's family, who usually lives a very frugal life, could not find any suitable items for a while. "Then send them my snacks and try to comfort the disaster victims?"

Secretaries' Meeting

A meeting that demonstrates the Prime Minister's hope to implement politics that are close to the hearts of the people is a meeting that the Prime Minister must have with secretaries Suzuki I., Suzuki T., and Nishimura Naomi every night from 9:00 PM. Before General Suzuki became prime minister, as long as there was nothing special, anyone who wanted to meet him could quickly get an opportunity to meet; this was the custom of General Suzuki's family. After becoming prime minister, General Suzuki said to his secretaries:

"I want to meet anyone and listen to anyone's words."

However, the Prime Minister certainly has no reason to receive everyone, so sometimes the secretaries receive them on his behalf. These three secretaries report everything they have seen and heard during the day to the old prime minister every night, no matter how big or small. Since the Suzuki Cabinet was formed, the number of letters and petitions sent to the Prime Minister's official residence has been no less than hundreds every day. The Prime Minister naturally does not have so much leisure time to read their contents one by one, and the secretaries open them and relay them. Therefore, the meeting every night always lasts more than an hour.

Determination to Win

Getting up at 5:00 AM and going to bed at 10:00 PM is General Suzuki's daily routine, but since becoming prime minister, this routine has been broken. The first statement at the inauguration: "I am willing to bury my old body in the front ranks of the people!" This is by no means a rhetorical phrase. The spirit of staying up all night for two or three days seems to have driven away the age of seventy-nine. Although people close to him advise him "not to overwork," the prime minister is still full of energy and does not take it seriously. According to one of his close aides, that kind of advice would tarnish the prime minister's determination to die.

Being inherently sincere, serving the public with sincerity, believing in the victory of the Greater East Asia War, comforting the people from time to time, and inspiring the people from time to time, is this old prime minister, Suzuki! (Translated from the Asahi Shimbun, April 21)

Weekly Commentary

### Commentary on the Chongqing Sixth National Congress

— Zhu Kejia

The Chongqing Kuomintang convened its Sixth National Congress starting (May 5), seemingly focusing on discussing the political outline after the end of the war. Judging from the information available here, the main agenda will focus on: 1. Concrete issues of convening the National Assembly; 2. Final decision on the May 5th Constitution; 3. Amendment of the Kuomintang's political program. From the perspective of the Kuomintang's fifty years of arduous struggle, apart from the First National Congress in 1924 under the personal leadership of Mr. Sun Yat-sen, this "Sixth National Congress" is more significant, because the above three issues to be discussed have objectively important relationships in various aspects, both internal and external. However, this is an observation based on the program posted on the stage. In reality, the play is still a play. But after watching so many similar continuous dramas, no matter how wonderful the performance on stage and how thunderous the applause from the audience, what effective results have they had for the interests of the country and the nation? Today, the common people have lost their charm for any good play. What they expect is not the beautiful singing, but the practice of saving the lifeblood of the country!

As for the issue of practice, there is no need to mention the old events that have disappointed the Chinese people in the past. Take today's theme of the Chongqing "Sixth National Congress": convening the National Assembly has been the common hope of the people for twenty years, but all they have gotten is listening to party members reciting the moving words in the Premier's will and the repeated breaches of trust by the authorities. Now, even if it is decided to hold it, how will the people elect truly representative representatives? How will the representatives exercise their powers to formulate the basic law of the country? The Chongqing Kuomintang political machine obviously has no satisfactory answer. As the Chongqing China Democratic Political League's declaration (January 30 of this year) said: "If only a part of the representatives elected in the 25th and 26th years are selected, and a number of representatives are assigned from some provinces where elections are impossible, in order to meet the quota of 1,440, and then several hundred Kuomintang Central Committee members and alternate Central Committee members are added as ex officio members, and a constitution that the whole country should abide by is to be formulated with this, and it is still said that it is returned to the people, and it is intended to achieve the national unity, we believe that the result will be counterproductive." In fact, how can the people in the Democratic Political League not know the intentions of the Chongqing authorities? In reality, the Chinese people all long for the early convening of a true National Congress of National Representatives to discuss national affairs and implement constitutional government, but it will only be possible after the national peace and unity is achieved. Otherwise, even if it is achieved, it will only be the opinions of a part of the people in less than one-third of the country, which will not be able to solve the overall national affairs in the future and will only increase future divisions.

Objectively speaking, the Chongqing "Sixth National Congress" has failed to eliminate the selfishness of individuals and factions, so it has failed to gain the support and trust of the people. This is an expected thing. We must solemnly point out: "When the Great Way is practiced, the world is for all." Now, the Chongqing Kuomintang's Sixth National Congress only knows how to create clever names, but in reality, it maintains and expands the rights of individuals and private parties, so it will naturally not have any effective prospects. However, looking at the overall situation, the consequences are extremely serious. If the Chinese people do not quickly plan for national peace and unity, then internal wars and external troubles, and endless wars will connect, and the Chinese nation's sinking will be fearful. I deeply hope that the whole country, from top to bottom, will quickly and fiercely wake up! Be practical, unite and unite, and strive for survival for China and East Asia.

### Dönitz Encourages German Troops to Continue Anti-Soviet Resistance; Western Isolated Troops Surrender to Britain and America

Stockholm, May 5th, Central News Agency Dispatch - According to a German radio report: German new head of state General Dönitz broadcasted to the German troops in central, southern, and southeastern Germany today as follows: "The only purpose for which the German troops must continue to fight is to rescue the German people from 'Bolshevization' and 'enslavement'. This is your most sacred task. This task will certainly be realized in the future in the spirit of the former head of state and in the spirit of defending the nation. However, anyone who plans for his own survival alone will not only fail to save the entire society but will also be a public enemy of the German people, and we must deal with them in the same way. Unconditional obedience, iron discipline, and cooperation in all aspects should be emphasized now more than ever before. Furthermore, the isolated German troops in the north, west, and south have laid down their arms after glorious struggles, but further fighting against the Western powers has become meaningless."

Stockholm, May 5th, Central News Agency Dispatch - According to news from London: It is widely believed that the German government under the leadership of Admiral Dönitz has moved to Norway. It is reported that the new German head of state discussed with the German administrative officials stationed in Denmark and Norway yesterday.

Stockholm, May 5th, Central News Agency Dispatch - According to the London Observer: The German troops in the Netherlands, northwestern Germany, and Denmark have surrendered to General Montgomery. This, combined with the surrender of the German troops in Italy and western Austria to Marshal Alexander, has created a situation in which there will be no more German resistance to the Western Allied forces. In theory, the German naval, land, and air forces in Norway and the German troops in various ports in France and the Aegean Sea can continue to resist, but the German troops are now only resisting the enemy coming from the east.

Stockholm, May 5th, Central News Agency Dispatch - According to a Danish broadcast of a German Supreme Headquarters communiqué on the 4th: After fierce fighting, the German troops in the Mecklenburg region entered the Allied-occupied zone on the west bank of the Elbe River and laid down their arms and surrendered.

### Eisenhower Declares Thorough Destruction of German Troops

Zurich, May 5th, Central News Agency Dispatch - Eisenhower declared on the 4th: "We will thoroughly destroy the German troops on land, at sea, and in the air. Those who are now requesting surrender are only the defeated German troops."

### Churchill Remains in London Awaiting Developments

Stockholm, May 5th, Central News Agency Dispatch - Rumors of Germany's surrender are spreading all over Europe. The London radio station describes it with the phrase "imminent." British Prime Minister Churchill will personally announce this news to the British people. He remained at his official residence on Downing Street today and attended Parliament for only two minutes. A loudspeaker has been placed in his office, ready to announce to Parliament when the surrender news arrives. Since the initial news of Himmler's peace negotiations from San Francisco, reports of collective or individual surrenders have been coming from neutral countries and from the battlefields every minute, but the news that Marshal Montgomery is directly negotiating surrender with the new German head of state has not yet been confirmed. However, the situation is extremely fluid, and anything is possible. The individual surrenders of German troops show that the German troops only want to continue resisting for a few days, but there is still reason to believe that the war may not end immediately, because there are still hundreds of German submarines operating overseas, and the Allies must wait for them all to return to show their sincerity. However, the fact that the Ministry of Domestic Security has issued instructions to prepare for celebrating Victory Day is an indication that the Allies cannot wait too long.

### 1.5 Million German Troops in Encirclement Pockets Continue to Resist

Stockholm, May 5th, Central News Agency Dispatch - While the British, American, and Soviet armies are sweeping away the remaining resistance strongholds of the German troops with large forces, offices all over the world are spreading rumors that Germany is about to surrender. Various parties are making strong inferences about the possibility that the Allies will issue a final surrender ultimatum, which will make the Germans who continue to resist unprotected by law. Just as important as crossing the Kiel Canal is the problem of how to deal with the 500,000 German troops who have surrendered since the Allies broke through the Elbe River bridgehead, which the British army is finding difficult.

According to Allied observers, there are approximately 1.5 million German troops in various encirclement pockets in various parts of Europe who continue to resist. The main areas are listed below: The German 20th Army, commanded by General Boehme, has approximately 150,000 to 300,000 troops, possessing 300 submarines and a small number of aircraft in Norway. In Czechoslovakia, eastern Austria, northwestern Yugoslavia, and a small part of Bavaria, part of the 8th Army, commanded by General Höhne, is still fighting in the Czech Republic. The remnants of the 1st and 19th Armies, commanded by Field Marshal Kesselring, and a small number of stormtroopers in eastern Austria and Bavaria, as well as parts of the German 6th and 8th Armies and the remnants of the 2nd and 6th Panzer Armies, may still be in the area. There may still be six to ten divisions of troops in Yugoslavia, with a considerable strength of approximately 350,000 troops in this pocket. The 25th Army, commanded by General Christiansen in western Netherlands, has approximately 100,000 troops. In the area of 5,000 square kilometers around Liepāja in Latvia, approximately 15 to 30 divisions of German troops continue to resist. In the northern pocket, several divisions of German troops between the Elbe and Ems rivers are defending Emden and Wilhelmshaven. In the southern Aegean Sea and the islands of Greece, it was previously reported that 10,000 German troops were stationed on Crete and 20,000 were distributed on Rhodes. Between the Bug and Tisza rivers, at the meeting point of the American and Soviet forces, an unknown number of German troops are still surrounded. There are a total of 91,000 troops in the French port areas, including 12,000 in Dunkirk, 25,000 in Lorient, 35,000 in Saint-Nazaire, and 19,000 in La Rochelle. There are still 20,000 to 31,000 German troops on the small islands in the English Channel, and an unknown number of German troops and marines on the Frisian Islands and Heligoland in the North Sea. There are still thousands of German troops on the Hel Peninsula.

### Voting Issues at the San Francisco Conference

Disagreement Between the United States and the Soviet Union

Lisbon, May 4th, Central News Agency Dispatch - According to a San Francisco dispatch: The Byelorussian issue seems to be a difficulty at the San Francisco Conference, and now the United States and the Soviet Union disagree on the voting issue. The United States advocates a majority voting system, while the Soviet Union advocates an absolute majority system of more than two-thirds. As a result of inviting Byelorussia, Ukraine, and Argentina to participate, the total number of participating countries is now 49. If the United States' proposal is adopted, the conference can pass a resolution with the approval of 25 votes. If the Soviet Union's proposal is adopted, at least 33 votes are required. The reason why the United States advocates majority rule is that the 21 countries in the Americas, plus the American puppet states of Liberia and the Philippines, total 23 countries. Therefore, if it obtains the support of two more countries, the United States can arbitrarily control the conference. However, the Soviet Union thoroughly advocates a two-thirds majority, and its attitude is quite firm.

### Colonial Issues and Japan's Stance

Chinese and Japanese Nations Struggle for Independence

European countries have successively seized colonies in the Americas, Africa, India, Australia, and the South Seas. Any gap in areas outside Europe is immediately exploited by them. Later, they extended their reach to Japan and China, demanding the opening of commercial ports for trade and facilitating Christian missionary work. Through various methods, they gradually eroded the independence of East Asian countries, leading to the gradual decline or control by others, groaning under the domination and exploitation of imperialist countries. More than half of the East Asian nations are in this state. Only Japan, China, and Thailand勉强maintain the nominal status of independence, but as early as a century ago, they had become semi-independent, with the potential of becoming colonies. Japan was the first to awaken and strive for complete independence, and China also launched the National Revolution to seek complete independence. Thailand is also actively working towards this goal.

Britain and America Adopt Malicious Policies

When the Anglo-Saxons crossed over to the Americas, how did they treat the Native Americans? And how did they treat the indigenous people of Australia? The Anglo-Saxons adopted a malicious policy of never compromising with the indigenous people, killing them all. We only need to read the history of Anglo-Saxon development in the Americas and Australia to understand that their methods are selfish and inhumane. The Latin nations' method of developing South America is to adopt a compromising approach, taking into account the interests of the indigenous people, or intermarrying and integrating cultures. The Anglo-Saxons are different, they are the most terrifying nation in the world. Not only do they not allow each nation to find its place, but they also seize it by force. This behavior is the main cause of war. In other words, the real cause of war lies in the fact that countries such as Britain, America, France, and the Netherlands possess vast and fertile territories and colonies that exceed their population proportions and are not open to others. For example, Britain has the largest colonies, and on average, each Briton can control 17 people of different ethnicities. This unreasonable state is the cause of war.

Colonial Resource Allocation Issues

Twelve or thirteen years ago, scholars around the world advocated that in order to avoid war, the distribution of colonies must be adjusted. In September 1935, American Major Howe discussed this issue, and his proposal to redistribute colonial resources attracted attention from various countries. On October 17th of the following year, the International Labor Organization passed a resolution to establish a committee on raw material resources. Although Japan had already withdrawn from the League of Nations at that time, it was still invited to join, and Commercial Secretary Shuto of the embassy in Germany represented Japan in the committee. At the meeting on March 8th, 1937, the British representative Lister proposed the following: Oppose the redistribution of territory, oppose opening the doors of colonies. The economic relationship between old colonies and their home countries is inseparable, and opening colonies often hinders their development and harms the well-being of residents. It is extremely difficult to obtain raw materials. Secretary Shuto, following instructions from the Japanese government, advocated: 1. Labor, technology, and capital can freely enter all lands, 2. Abolish restrictions on the export of raw material resources by various countries, 3. Eliminate trade barriers, and apply the Congo Basin Treaty regarding the opening of colonies to all colonies worldwide. He clarified the proposal for opening colonies. However, the initiator of the meeting, Britain, avoided solving important issues, and representatives from the Union of South Africa, the Netherlands, Canada, and France all supported Britain's proposal, leading to the complete failure of the meeting. Japan's proposal was not only the proposal of Mr. Shuto at that meeting. In January 1936, when the Japanese opened the 68th session of the Diet, Foreign Minister Hirota also advocated free trade, open doors, freedom of communication, and equal access to resources in his speech. The following year, in Foreign Minister Arita's speech on diplomatic policy in the Diet, he further clarified the Japanese government's specific policies for opening colonies, advocating that the Congo Basin Treaty be applied to all colonies worldwide. Regarding the opening of colonies, Japan's proposal has always been consistent.

Six years after this speech, in 1943, colonies in various parts of the Greater East Asia were successively declared independent and liberated. The Greater East Asia Declaration is an epoch-making milestone in national progress, and the colonial issue in Greater East Asia has gradually been resolved. The colonial issue, which has often been the cause of war, has been reduced.

Adhere to Ideals and Shatter Violence

However, Britain and America are attempting to use force to turn the now independent countries back into colonies. They verbally advocate freedom and lead backward countries, but in reality, they deprive other countries of freedom and independence and exploit their interests. Why did this war start? We are fighting in the Pacific to liberate colonies, while Britain and America are fighting to make the liberated colonies become colonies again. Will ideals prevail, or will violence prevail? We firmly believe that we will be able to shatter the enemy's violence and adhere to our ideals. This is our only mission and great intention. (End)

### Central Reserve Bank to Issue Gold Certificates Starting Tomorrow to Tighten Currency and Suppress Prices

In order to tighten currency, suppress prices, stabilize people's livelihoods, and increase combat power, the National Government's Ministry of Finance has specially approved the Central Reserve Bank to issue gold certificates. These gold certificates are denominated in one tael, five taels, and ten taels. They are scheduled to be issued starting tomorrow (the 7th). At the same time, a Gold Certificate Issuance Reserve Management Committee will be established to be responsible for managing the gold that backs the issuance of gold certificates. Minister of Finance Zhou specially issued a statement, and Vice President Qian of the Central Reserve Bank also met with reporters from the Sino-Japanese News at 3:00 p.m. yesterday (the 5th) to clarify the significance of issuing gold certificates. The details are recorded below:

### Minister of Finance Zhou Issues Statement

Minister of Finance Zhou Fohai issued a special statement regarding the issuance of gold certificates, saying: "The government, in view of the recent price and currency situation, believes that tightening currency and suppressing prices are indispensable tasks for stabilizing people's livelihoods and increasing combat power. Therefore, it has decided to order the Central Reserve Bank to issue gold certificates. This is a suitable and effective method for the recovery and tightening of currency. Gold certificates are certificates that are periodically redeemable for gold. They have sufficient gold reserves, and influential figures from the government and the public have been recruited to form the Gold Certificate Reserve Management Committee, which is specifically responsible for the issuance of certificates and the management of gold reserves, to guarantee the redemption of gold certificates upon maturity. It is very easy for people to purchase gold certificates, which is more convenient than purchasing cash and can avoid the danger of hoarding. These gold certificates can also be freely traded, providing the public with a good and secure investment channel. The main purpose of issuing gold certificates is to recover and tighten currency. Therefore, the value of the Central Reserve Bank notes will naturally become more stable. However, there will be no changes to the currency system. Therefore, this measure is definitely not creating a new currency, nor is it to link the Central Reserve Bank notes to gold. It is hoped that the public will understand this purpose and actively subscribe to help achieve its success."

### Preparation Committee Officially Established

In order to manage the gold reserves for the issuance of gold certificates, the Central Reserve Bank has specially established a Gold Certificate Issuance Reserve Management Committee within the Shanghai Branch of the Central Reserve Bank. Zhou Fohai, President of the Central Reserve Bank, will serve as the Chairman of the Committee, and Qian Daqu, Vice President, will serve as the Vice Chairman. Shao Hongzhu, Director of the Issuance Bureau, Liu Ruxiang, Director of the Business Bureau, and Yuan Fudeng, Chairman of the Shanghai Special City Chamber of Commerce, Wu Zhenxiu, Chairman of the Bank of China, Tang Shoumin, Chairman of the Bank of Communications, Ye Fuxiao, Chairman of the City Bankers' Association, Zhu Boquan, Chairman of the Bank Union Reserve Committee, and Pei Yunqing, Chairman of the City Money Trade Association, have been appointed as members. The establishment ceremony was held at 10:00 a.m. yesterday (the 5th) at the Shanghai Branch of the Central Reserve Bank.

### Measures for Issuing and Redeeming Gold Certificates

Measures for the Central Reserve Bank to issue and redeem gold certificates:

(1) This bank is specially authorized by the Ministry of Finance to issue gold certificates, divided into three types: one tael certificates, five tael certificates, and ten tael certificates.

(2) Gold certificates are redeemed for gold on a specified date based on the certificate, recognizing the certificate but not the person.

(3) The issuance date of the gold certificates will be determined and announced by this bank at any time with reference to market conditions.

(4) The sale price and redemption date of the gold certificates will be announced by this bank at the time of issuance.

(5) The sale of gold certificates is based on the principle of collecting cash, but checks or bank notes paid by this bank may also be collected.

(6) Gold certificates may be redeemed for gold bars, but when the weight of the gold bars differs from the face value of the certificate, the difference should be calculated and collected according to the sale price of the gold certificates.

(7) These rules will be implemented after approval, and the same applies to amendments.

### Celebrating Youth Day, Holding a Joint Gathering, Attended by More Than a Thousand Youth Representatives

In order to celebrate the "May 5th" Youth Day, the city youth league headquarters sent representatives to Beijing to participate in the national youth league member review. In addition, at 9:00 a.m. on the 5th, a youth gathering was held at the Great Light Theater. Gu, the secretary-general of the New Life Movement Shanghai Branch, represented Secretary Li Liuxiao, as well as Yuan Weicun, Shen Zhaofeng, and responsible officials from each district league headquarters, all came to guide the meeting. More than a thousand professional youth students and youth league members attended the meeting. First, Secretary Li gave a speech, elaborating on the meaning of Youth Day and the responsibilities of young people. Then, the Youth Song was sung, and Shen Zhaofeng led the entire group in shouting national slogans, and the music was played to complete the ceremony. Finally, a Youth Theater Troupe performed "Soul of the Party Member," and the meeting ended at 12:00 noon.

In addition, four schools in Zhabei, including the Qunyi, Laian, and Huguang Municipal Elementary Schools, jointly held a joint review at the Zhabei Elementary School playground at 10:00 a.m., with Shi Yun, the principal of Zhabei Elementary School, serving as the reviewing officer. More than 300 young people participated.

### Director of Information Idebuchi Expresses Thoughts on Youth Day

The information department of the Japanese Army in Shanghai held a regular press conference at 11:30 a.m. on the 5th, as usual. Director Idebuchi arrived on time with Lieutenant Nakagawa, and Director Idebuchi explained the recent war situation on the spot. He also expressed his thoughts on Youth Day for Chinese Youth in the East Asian region as follows: "Youth is the driving force of the country, and its thinking and ability to act contribute greatly to the country and nation. Youth in all countries tend to be the same. Especially in times of national emergency, every country relies more on youth. Japanese youth go to the front lines to serve in the army, and others actively engage in production at home. Therefore, Japanese youth are working hard in every job, just like in China and East Asia. In short, any country takes youth as the center." Finally, Director Idebuchi raised his glass to wish all the youths of the Greater East Asia nations happiness without end, and the meeting ended at 1:30 p.m.

### Citizens Returning to Their Hometowns Should Process Household Registration Changes

Many residents of Shanghai who have returned to their hometowns have not processed household registration changes and have simply taken their residence permits with them, resulting in a chaotic household registration situation that is prone to corruption. The root cause is that the processing is slow and the application procedures are difficult, so people regard reporting changes as a daunting task. If transportation is convenient, they simply depart without legally processing the change procedures. Household registration and other matters are the basic requirements of government administration. At this time when Shanghai is evacuating its population, the application for changes by idle residents must be simplified as much as possible and processed immediately upon arrival, without delays. The Municipal Government has issued orders to each sub-bureau and Baojia office, instructing each district Baojia general office to comply. It is hoped that citizens who move will be sure to process the declaration according to the procedures and not take their residence permits back to their hometowns to prevent abuses.

### Strict Enforcement of Vehicle Lighting and Sound Control by the Police Bureau; Air Defense Headquarters Inspects All Vehicles in the City

Due to repeated enemy air raids on Shanghai, the Municipal Police Bureau is strengthening its air defense tasks, especially strictly enforcing lighting control. In addition to indoor lighting control, it is also paying attention to vehicle lighting and has ordered each sub-bureau to strictly enforce it. All vehicles must be equipped with air defense lights in accordance with the regulations of the military and police authorities, and sound control must also be strictly observed. Violators will be arrested, the vehicles will be taken to the bureau, and the owners will be required to improve the vehicle lights and be punished, in order to improve the city's lighting control. It is reported that the Lao Zha Sub-bureau mobilized all the police officers of the second team the night before to thoroughly enforce vehicle lighting control in the district, detaining more than 200 various vehicles in violation of regulations, and they were all punished according to law.

Also, it is reported that the Shanghai Municipal Civil Air Defense Headquarters is strengthening the implementation of air defense in view of the increasingly tense situation. In order to inspect the lighting and sound control of vehicles throughout the city, the chief of the air defense section, Yamamoto, the deputy chief, Li Zhenhuan, and Kobayashi of the transportation section have been taking turns inspecting designated locations in each district sub-bureau from 8:00 p.m. to 10:00 p.m. every day since the 3rd of this month. It is scheduled to end on the 8th. However, on the 17th Air Defense Day on the 9th, personnel from the Air Defense and Transportation Sections will conduct inspections throughout the district from 8:00 p.m. to 9:00 p.m. and from 10:00 p.m. to 11:00 p.m.

### Yangtze River Sailing Transport to Expand Routes

Since the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company added a sailing transport department in the middle of last month to manage the Yangtze River sailing vessel transportation on various lines, the business has been quite developed. It is now known that the company is actively planning to expand the sailing routes. It is reported that the direct sailing routes will include more than ten ports on the Yangtze River, including Renjiagang, Lao Honggang, Yaogang, Tianshenggang, Shierwei Port, New Port, Zhang Huanggang, Chongming, and Hai, with at least one round trip per week. It will greatly help smooth the transportation of materials.

### Silver and Money Industries Change Check Collection Time

The banks and financial institutions in this city received a notice from the United Reserve Depository yesterday, regarding the change of time for the collection of negotiable instruments among the industry. It is stipulated that exchanges must be completed before 10:00 a.m. every day. Overdue transactions will be exchanged the following day. All banks and financial institutions have been implementing this change since yesterday morning (the 5th).

### 19th Period Household Sugar; Deadline for Supplementary Issuance

The office announced that retailers should issue sugar based on receipts from the 6th to the 10th of this month, and supplementary issues will not be made after the deadline. All citizens who submitted the Y-ticket of the 44th General Ration Certificate to the retailer during the sugar sale period and obtained the store's receipt must take the sugar based on the store's receipt within the deadline, and do not delay themselves.

### Seventeenth Air Defense Day: Training Alert Time - Sirens Will Not Sound Except for Actual Alerts

The ninth of this month is the seventeenth Air Defense Day. The Civil Air Defense Headquarters of the city will, as usual, launch air defense drills in various districts of the city. This training includes controls on lighting, traffic, and sound. However, on this training day, the sirens will not sound. The time of issuance and cancellation of alerts will be published in advance in various newspapers and broadcast on the radio.

### Introducing the Nanshi People's Hospital

— Xi

The "Nanshi People's Hospital," as the name suggests, reveals its location and characteristics. In fact, this hospital is located close to the city center at 775 Minquan Road, near Zhengjia Wood Bridge. The property of the hospital was formerly the Tongyi Benevolent Association Building, which was once used as the "Green Treasure Gambling Hall." Transportation is very convenient. It is not only the largest and most well-equipped hospital in Nanshi at present, but also the only large hospital in the southeast corner of Huangpu District. It is a pity that it is not well-known.

### Establishment Process

The hospital was founded in the late spring of the thirty-second year of the Republic [1943]. At that time, public-spirited individuals recognized that Nanshi had not yet recovered from the devastation of the war, and all facilities were mostly rudimentary. The residents of the area were mostly people with weak financial resources, and with the rising prices, ordinary people found it increasingly difficult to bear the burden of medical expenses. Therefore, every summer, epidemics bred, and they were helpless. Thus, the establishment of the Nanshi Epidemic Hospital was proposed to supplement the shortage of hospitals in the area. The hospital was initially set up at Sanle Ying, Yifeng Lane, Zhaojia Road. The layout was roughly arranged, and diagnosis and treatment were immediately provided. From summer to autumn and winter, it saved the lives of five to six thousand civilians. Later, as more people became aware of it and the number of patients increased, the hospital site was insufficient. Furthermore, due to the lack of a fully equipped hospital in the area, the hospital's board of directors resolved to expand it into a people's hospital.

After moving to the new site in January of the thirty-fourth year [1945], the buildings were renovated. The entire hospital has more than eighty rooms, with good air circulation and ample light, which is very suitable for medical use. The chairman of the board is Wang Yongkang, and the president of the hospital is Jin Xuegao. There are ten doctors, sixteen nurses, six interns, and twelve hospital staff. The director of the medical department is Zheng Weiru, under whom are divided: Internal Medicine, Pediatrics, Surgery, Tuberculosis, Obstetrics and Gynecology, Dermatology, Ophthalmology, Addiction Treatment, Otolaryngology, Physical Therapy, and Dispensing (double prescription) departments. The director of the general affairs department is Xu Weiyu, under whom are divided: Document Department, General Affairs Section, and Accounting Section.

### Complete Equipment

The expanded hospital has more than forty wards, with a total of more than one hundred and twenty beds. Specialized doctors in various departments were also newly hired, with experts in charge. Nurses were added, X-ray machines were purchased, and a surgery room was newly opened, equipped with the latest German-made operating table, electric hemostatic device, etc. The laboratory is also equipped with extremely precise instruments. The important equipment of the hospital is almost all available, which is much more complete than the small hospitals in the city.

### Free Diagnosis and Treatment

The hospital provides completely free medical treatment for civilians from 9:00 AM to 11:30 AM. From 2:00 PM to 5:00 PM, a small consultation fee is charged: 100 yuan for the first visit, 50 yuan for a follow-up visit, 200 yuan for an emergency visit, and 400 yuan for a house call. For ward meals, first-class is 2,400 yuan per day with two meals and one porridge, second-class is 2,200 yuan per day, second-class is 1,800 yuan per day with two meals and one porridge, and third-class is 1,000 yuan per day with two porridge and one meal. Delivery hospitalization for one week, including medical expenses, surgery fees, and room and board, costs 10,000 yuan. Those with difficult financial situations can request free medical treatment. Therefore, monthly expenses are about 4 million yuan, and the income is far from sufficient. We hope that people from all walks of life will actively donate funds to expand the people's medical fund.

Sports

### Soccer Third Division League: Re-Match Decides Championship - Xuan Hui vs. Warren, 10:30 AM This Morning at Jiaozhou Park

In the final between Xuan Hui and Warren in the Third Division Soccer League, the struggle unfolded at Jiaozhou Park last weekend. The result was a 1-1 draw, and no goals were scored in extra time. It has now been decided to re-match at Jiaozhou Park at 10:30 AM this morning to determine the champion. Most of Xuan Hui's team is based on the players from the Third Provinces team from last year's First Division, so their combat strength is quite strong. The team's coach, Father Wang, considering the draw last week, was not satisfied with the adjustment of the lineup, so he decided to bring back Melson to resume the key position of center back. In the forward line, Gu Yi will lead the three armies, and Pang Panfang will serve as the right substitute. At that time, they will surely be able to overcome difficulties and achieve results. Warren's strength is also quite elite. When the two teams meet, an exciting match is expected.

Xuan Hui: Gao Zhiwen, Wang Guoguang, Zhuang Wenquan, Xu Guofu, Melson, Zeng Shijie, Zhen Yuwei, Xu Deming, Gu Yiche, Pang Panfang, Zheng Simin.

Warren: Gu Biao, Wang Chunjiang, Wen Yulin, Anderson, Lang Shaoshan, Shen Longzhang, Gu Quanquan, Liu Zuru, Hu Bin, Lin Jiacheng, Xu Huanming.

### Poor Woman Searching for Daughter

A woman named Zheng recently came to this office claiming that she lives at 30 Jiahe Lane, Changde Road (formerly Hart Road). Her husband has been missing for a long time. She is a single mother of a four-year-old daughter named Cui'e, who was wearing a towel shirt, had hair on her head, a fair face, round eyes, and was holding a lucky-shaped vegetable basket. She went missing on May 2nd at the entrance of the alley and could not be found after searching everywhere. It was heard that near the Chongsong Pharmacy opposite the Jimei Village on Jing'an Temple Road, she was taken away by a young man in a gray suit and a young woman in a striped cheongsam and wearing sunglasses, whose names are unknown. Before leaving, they declared to the public that they would send her to the radio station to search for her. Mrs. Zheng rushed to the scene after hearing the news, but it was too late. She then went to various radio stations to inquire, but there was no news. After losing her daughter, Mrs. Zheng spends her days and nights in tears, in unbearable pain.
