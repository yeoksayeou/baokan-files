### Inspection Tour of Anhui, Huai, and Henan Completed: Acting Chairman Chen Returns to the Capital Yesterday, Inspecting Troops and Addressing Responsible Persons Along the Way

Nanjing, 22nd (Central News Agency) – To inspect the actual military and political situation in various localities, Acting Chairman Chen of the National Government departed from Nanjing on the 15th of this month for a northward tour.

On the return journey, they rested briefly in Xuzhou and Bengbu, and on the 22nd, they safely returned to the capital.

Nanjing, 22nd (Central News Agency) – Since assuming office, Acting Chairman Chen of the National Government has shown exceptional concern for the general political situation in various regions. Previously, in his capacity as Premier of the Executive Yuan, he inspected Suzhou, Hangzhou, and other places. In mid-April, he visited North China. Now, with the situation becoming increasingly urgent, in order to understand whether the military and political facilities in various regions can adapt to the current situation, he took time from his busy schedule to inspect Anhui, Huai, and Henan provinces for seven days, passing through Bengbu, Xuzhou, Shangqiu, Kaifeng, and other places. He was warmly welcomed by military officers, civilians, and Allied officials from all regions. Having completed his inspection on the 21st, he departed from Bengbu at 8:05 PM and arrived safely in the capital at 6:00 AM on the 22nd. A detailed account of the events is as follows:

Situation in Bengbu

At 9:00 PM on the 15th of this month, Acting Chairman Chen departed from Pukou aboard a special train for Bengbu, accompanied by over a hundred people. When the train departed, senior officials from various ministries and commissions of the Central Government gathered at the Xiaguan Wharf to see him off. It was raining heavily that day. After boarding the train, the Chairman frequently looked up at the sky, his face showing pleasure, as the capital had been suffering from a long drought, and the rain brought hope for agriculture. He seemed to feel no inconvenience from traveling in the rain. The train passed through Chuxian at midnight and Mingguang at 5:00 AM. Representatives from all sectors of the Party, government, military, and academia in these areas stood in the heavy rain late at night to welcome him. The Chairman sent special representatives to get off the train to express his regards and listen to their reports. At 7:30 AM on the 16th, the train arrived in Bengbu. Governor Lin Dongqian of Anhui Province, having heard the news in advance, had already made preparations and arranged a temporary residence in Tangyuan. When the Chairman arrived, Governor Lin led the heads of various provincial government agencies and senior Allied officials in standing solemnly at the station to welcome him. Amidst the melodious military music, Acting Chairman Chen stepped slowly off the train, raised his hand to greet the welcoming party, and went straight to the residence after leaving the station. The entire city was decorated with national flags, and the people lined the streets to welcome him with utmost respect. At 7:40 AM, he arrived at the residence to rest. After breakfast, at 9:00 AM, Governor Lin accompanied him to the parade ground. At 9:30 AM, the parade began. In the pouring rain, the Chairman ascended the inspection stand. First, the Chief Commander, Qin Hanqing, reported the number of officers and soldiers, police, defense corps, and youth groups under inspection. Then, accompanied by Governor Lin, he disregarded the muddy ground and walked around the parade ground to inspect the troops. All the inspected soldiers, police, youth groups, and students were greatly inspired by the Chairman's tireless spirit and felt deeply grateful. After the march-past, they respectfully requested Acting Chairman Chen to deliver a speech (the full text is recorded separately). The speech lasted for several tens of minutes. Finally, Governor Lin led the crowd in shouting slogans such as "Long Live the Chairman" and "Long Live the Republic of China," their voices resounding through the sky. At around 11:00 AM, the parade ended, and he returned to the residence. After a brief rest, he went to the provincial government to meet with officials and inquire about matters, expressing his deep appreciation for Anhui's military and political facilities. At 11:40 AM, in his capacity as Premier of the Executive Yuan, he sent representatives to visit the Allied Liaison Department and the Consulate General, to express condolences to the Allied Army Hospital, the Bengbu Provincial Hospital, and the Red Swastika Society, and to express appreciation to the Anhui Daily and the Bengbu Branch of the Central News Agency.

On the 17th, the special train arrived in Xuzhou. Governor Hao led all senior Party, government, and military officials, as well as senior Allied officials, in welcoming him. The special train arrived at the residence at 6:15 AM. The public lined the streets, and foreign residents also lined up to welcome him. The entire city was covered with slogans, and national flags fluttered in the wind, creating a new atmosphere. After Acting Chairman Chen arrived in Xuzhou, he saw that the city's buildings were magnificent and the layout was orderly, and he expressed his appreciation for the rapid reconstruction work. At 9:00 AM, he went to the Yunlongshan training ground to inspect the troops, accompanied by Governor Hao. The inspection began at 9:30 AM. On the inspection platform, the large characters "The Party Must Not Be Divided, the Country Must Be Unified" were spelled out. At that time, 21 cannon salutes were fired from White Cloud Mountain to pay tribute to the Chairman. First, the Chief Commander, Ji Rui, reported the number of officers and soldiers, police, defense corps, youth groups, firearms, and horses under inspection. Then, the Chairman was invited to inspect the troops for a week. After that, the march-past began. Approximately 20,000 soldiers, police, and students from Huaihai participated in the inspection, each forming a column of ten people. As they passed the inspection stand, they saluted. The troops continued to pass by for about two hours, and the Chairman stood in front of the stand throughout, frequently raising his hand to return the salute, showing no signs of fatigue. The soldiers were all inspired. The Chairman expressed his appreciation for the Huaihai soldiers' excellent equipment, outstanding quality, neat steps, and magnificent military appearance. After the march-past was completed, the Chairman was respectfully invited to deliver a speech (the original text is recorded separately). Then, Governor Hao led the crowd in shouting slogans. The inspection concluded at 12:00 PM, and he returned to the residence to rest. At 12:20 PM, senior officials from various departments and commissions of the provincial government met with the Chairman. At 1:00 PM, Governor Hao hosted a banquet. After a brief rest, the Chairman, in his capacity as Premier of the Executive Yuan, sent representatives to visit various Allied agencies and organizations. At around 5:00 PM, he inspected the repair shop, the 25th Division training regiment, the Huaihai Hospital, and other places, expressing his appreciation. At 7:00 PM, he hosted a banquet for senior provincial officials and Allied military and political dignitaries. The guests and hosts enjoyed themselves and the atmosphere was lively. At 11:00 PM, he departed from the provincial government. Tens of thousands of officials and civilians lined up to see him off with lanterns, the lights glittering and winding like a dragon, creating a novel and unprecedented grand scene.

Arriving in Shangqiu

At 5:40 AM on the 18th, the train arrived in Shangqiu. Zhang Fengfeng, Commander-in-Chief of the Fourth War Area, led the senior generals of the War Area to welcome him at the station. Local officials, civilians, and Allied residents and officials lined both sides of the avenue outside the city to welcome the Chairman's arrival. After the Chairman got off the train, he boarded a prepared car and went to Shangqiu County, where the welcoming crowds cheered enthusiastically along the way. Since the Incident, the situation in Henan had been unique, and few central officials had visited. Now that Acting Chairman Chen had come to inspect, their joy was indescribable. At 6:00 AM, he arrived at the residence. At 7:00 AM, he reviewed the troops, whose military appearance was extremely solemn. Division Commander Wang Xiangjiu served as the Chief Commander. The entire venue was surrounded by tens of thousands of spectators, who could be said to have come from all over the city, fully expressing their affection. After the inspection was carried out in accordance with the ceremony, the Chairman addressed the military officers and civilians of the area, emphasizing the issue of China's unification and encouraging them to strive for Henan's prosperity. Finally, Commander-in-Chief Zhang led the crowd in shouting slogans such as "Obey the Central Government" and "Support the Supreme Commander." Tens of thousands of people responded in unison, their voices shaking the sky. At around 9:00 AM, he returned to the residence, where the generals met with him. At 10:30 AM, Commander-in-Chief Zhang reported on the situation of the War Area. Then, the Chairman summoned the generals of various armies. After listening to the reports, the Chairman expressed his appreciation for the security situation within the military region, stating that the area not only maintained its special points but also occupied a complete surface, with no trace of communist forces existing within its borders. At 12:30 PM, Commander-in-Chief Zhang hosted a banquet for the Chairman at the War Area Headquarters and invited senior Allied generals to accompany them. At 4:30 PM, he inspected the military education corps, where the corps respectfully requested the Chairman to deliver a speech, recounting the failures of past Chinese education and encouraging them to abide by discipline and seek knowledge. The listeners were inspired. He then continued to inspect the ordnance branch and the military hospital. The Chairman showed great concern for the wounded and sick soldiers. At around 6:00 PM, he had earnest discussions with relevant parties. At 7:00 PM, he hosted a banquet for the generals. At 11:00 PM, he departed from Shangqiu for Bian, and the entire group went to the station to see him off.

Encouraging the People of Henan

At 4:30 AM on the 19th, he arrived in Bian. As Governor Bao Wen was away in Ping for official business and could not return in time, General Gu Bingdong, Director of the Kaifeng Pacification Headquarters, led the senior officials of the provincial capital, the public, and Allied officials and residents in gathering at the station to welcome him. The public and students waited on both sides of the road in the city. At 5:00 AM, he arrived at the residence to rest. At 6:30 AM, he went to the Pacification Headquarters to inspect the Fifth War Area. Commander-in-Chief Pang Bingdong was an old friend of the Chairman, and they were extremely happy to meet again in Bian. When the Chairman arrived, the senior generals of the War Area stood solemnly on the training ground to welcome him. The inspected soldiers were well-trained. When the inspection reached the technical demonstration, air raid sirens suddenly sounded. At that time, the Chairman watched the performing soldiers, remaining calm as usual. The inspected soldiers were greatly inspired by this spirit. After the demonstration was completed, at 12:20 PM, he gave a speech to all the officers and soldiers in the auditorium, earnestly instructing them on national peace and unification, repeatedly clarifying the importance of the Party not being divided and the country being unified, and analyzing the world situation, encouraging the military and civilians of Henan to strive for peace and work hard for unification. The listeners were deeply moved. At 1:00 PM, the provincial government and the Pacification Headquarters jointly hosted a banquet and invited Allied generals stationed in the area to accompany them. At around 3:00 PM, he had increasingly important talks with Chinese and Japanese figures. At 6:00 PM, he hosted a banquet. At 9:00 PM, he departed from Bian, and the entire group saw him off, with the public expressing their reluctance to part.

Returning to the Capital Yesterday

At 2:00 AM that night, he passed through Shangqiu, and Commander-in-Chief Zhang made a special trip to the station in the middle of the night to pay his respects. At around 3:00 AM, the special train continued eastward. At 10:00 AM, he arrived in Xuzhou, and Governor Hao led officials and civilians in welcoming the Chairman. After getting off the train, he went to the residence to rest. In the afternoon, he summoned relevant parties for earnest discussions. At 9:00 AM, he responded to Xuzhou. On the 21st, at 6:00 AM, he arrived in Lin, and Governor led officials in welcoming him. At 6:05 AM, the Anhui Provincial Youth Corps presented a flag to the Chairman. At 6:10 AM, after resting briefly at the residence, he began summoning military, government, Party officials, and representatives of the gentry at the residence at 7:30 AM for instructions, which lasted until around 11:00 AM. At 4:00 PM in the afternoon, local military and government officials respectfully requested the Chairman's calligraphy, and the Chairman granted their requests, writing many screen panels and horizontal plaques. At 9:00 PM, he departed from Bengbu, and the entire group saw him off. At 6:00 AM on the 22nd, he safely returned to the capital. Under the respectful welcome of officials from various central departments, he crossed the river and took a car back to his official residence to rest.

### Acting Chairman Chen's Address: Announcing Three National Policies, Striving for National Independence and Freedom

Nanjing, 22nd (Central News Agency) – Acting Chairman Chen delivered earnest speeches while inspecting youth groups in Bengbu, Xuzhou, Shangqiu, and Bian. This article is a comprehensive record. (A Record of Acting Chairman Chen's Address to the Armies of Anhui, Huai, and Henan) I am very pleased to meet you all on this inspection tour of Bengbu, Xuzhou, Shangqiu, and Bian. Along the way, I have seen new atmospheres in various local constructions, which are the results of the effective leadership of local responsible officials and the efforts of military officers and civilians throughout the province. Now, seeing the vigorous spirit and orderly steps of all the officers, I feel immense comfort and firmly believe that the Central Government has entrusted the right people to the localities.

I have two objectives in this inspection tour: First, the current situation is tense and at a critical juncture. It is important to know whether the general military and political facilities in various localities can meet the needs of the current situation. Therefore, I want to personally visit various places to understand the truth. At the same time, I am well aware that you have worked hard in the localities due to the complexity and difficulty of the environment. I would like to take this opportunity to meet with you and express the Central Government's condolences to all of you. Second, it is to announce the intentions of the Central Government and clearly tell everyone that the Central Government's policies will not change no matter how urgent the situation may be. What are the Central Government's policies? Simply put, they are "Peace, Anti-Communism, and National Construction," which are the national policies personally set by the late Chairman Wang upon returning to the capital. We strive for national freedom through peace, achieve national unification through anti-communism, and consolidate national independence through national construction. No matter how urgent the situation may be, the Central Government will continue to work hard to inherit the legacy of the late Chairman Wang, and will not change now, nor will it change in the future.

Hoping for Three Efforts from the Military and Civilians

In addition to the above two points, I would also like to tell you and hope that everyone will work hard on the following three issues: China's participation in the war is voluntary, not only to strive for China's independence and freedom, but also to follow the teachings of the Founding Father. Because in the past century, in the Asian region east of the Suez Canal, except for Japan, which is an independent country, although Thailand is nominally independent, it is actually controlled by Europe and the United States and only maintains a semi-independent status. The rest, such as India, Annam, Burma, the Philippines, Malaya, Sumatra, and Java, have all become colonies of Britain and the United States, and our China has fallen into a sub-colonial status. To strive for the independence and freedom of our own country, we must unite with weak nations to fight together. It is not enough to achieve China's freedom and independence alone; it is necessary for all East Asian nations to be liberated in order to guarantee our independence and freedom. If we examine the current situation, it seems that the European war has ended, but do you think that this is the true victory of Britain and the United States? Absolutely not. (To be continued)

Editorial

### Rationally Solving the People's Food Problem

Regarding the people's food problem, we have repeatedly discussed our views and made active suggestions to the relevant authorities. Since the authorities implemented emergency measures, we have further suggested that the second major task be implemented immediately, which is to make every effort to suppress rice prices, because emergency measures are a means, and suppressing rice prices is the goal. After rice prices are suppressed, we should further strive to rationally solve the people's food problem. Otherwise, temporary drops or easing of rice prices will be difficult to sustain. Our so-called second step of measures includes the following three key points:

First, the people's food problem is by no means a sudden problem. It has causes and will inevitably affect the people's food problem in the future. In order to rationally solve it, we should not only consider the present but also consider at least the next year. Therefore, we believe that before the autumn harvest this year, we must plan the most appropriate solution in advance, gathering opinions and strengths from all parties to promote it together. Regarding the most important purchase methods in the future, opinions from various parties are certainly not completely consistent, but in any case, in order to rationally solve the people's food problem and to fulfill the common purpose of the Greater East Asia War, close cooperation between the Chinese and Japanese authorities and the Chinese people is indispensable; it cannot be successfully achieved without any one of these parties. Therefore, before the autumn harvest, we must concentrate the opinions and strengths of the three parties to plan a comprehensive and appropriate solution.

Second, in terms of the current people's food problem in this city, emergency measures alone are not enough. After these emergency measures, we must take measures to ensure that the emergency measures are fully effective; otherwise, the problem will become serious again. What we mean by measures to ensure that the emergency measures are fully effective is to ensure the smooth flow of food rice sources. Speaking of this, relying solely on the grain merchants of this city is not enough. Because, today, to ensure the smooth flow of food rice sources, first, a sufficiently adequate capital cost is required, second, sufficiently adequate means of transportation are required, and third, the power to avoid various obstacles along the way is required. To have solutions for these three aspects is definitely beyond the ability of current grain merchants. Therefore, it also requires the joint efforts of the Chinese and Japanese authorities and the Chinese people to achieve this common requirement of ensuring the smooth flow of food rice sources. The main thing is still for the municipal government to support it, or for a civil organization to cooperate with the existing, relatively sound food control agencies under the cooperation of the Chinese and Japanese parties.

Third, there are still many factors hindering the rational solution of the people's food problem in this city. For example, because the aforementioned smooth flow of sources cannot be achieved, the authorities' emergency measures may lose their effectiveness. On the other hand, the vast majority of the people are suffering from double oppression. Because grain merchants need cash and do not accept payment orders and promissory notes in credit currency, ordinary citizens are subjected to double oppression and still have to buy food at the highest price. Our newspaper has recently received letters from people from all walks of life complaining about the pain in this regard, no less than hundreds or thousands. For example, a certain Mr. X wrote in a letter that he is an employee of a certain large department store, with elderly and young family members and no permanent property. In addition to his own lunch at the company, the salary he earns each month is only more than 60,000 yuan, and this month's income is only enough to buy one dou of rice. The company issues checks uniformly, and what is exchanged is only a payment order, and it is necessary to discount it to exchange it for cash, otherwise, it is impossible to buy miscellaneous grains, vegetables, and daily necessities. It is difficult for the whole family to survive on even a thin gruel. Another example is a letter from a cultured person, Mr. Mo, who was lucky enough to borrow a 200,000 yuan check and managed to exchange it for a payment order. He personally went to Zhoujiabang to buy rice, hoping to be cheaper, but no one accepted the payment order. After all kinds of efforts, he finally managed to discount it to cash at 80%. As a result, a loan of 200,000 yuan only bought two dou of rice, and he found 4,000 yuan in cash! Now, the general public is enduring unnecessary suffering under such an irrational situation. Therefore, we also hope that the relevant authorities will quickly seek solutions to the various relationships that actually hinder the solution of the people's food problem. Specifically, it is to: Strictly prohibit any behavior that hinders the smooth flow of rice sources. Thoroughly implement restrictions on banks issuing payment orders and effectively crack down on the evil practice of discounting. Public and private institutions should issue salaries in cash as much as possible; otherwise, at least salaries below 100,000 yuan should not be issued by check.

In short, in this decisive stage, everyone should abandon their own selfish profits and take the overall situation into account, and not let the vast majority of the people endure unnecessary suffering, thereby reducing the total strength in the decisive battle.

### Wartime Economic Measures Law Announced and Implemented by the Japanese Government; Tokyo Metropolitan Volunteer Corps Fully Established

Tokyo, 22nd (Central News Agency) – The Japanese government, in view of the tense situation that the mainland will be transformed into a battlefield, in order to implement the Wartime Emergency Measures Law established and passed by the 87th Extraordinary Diet as soon as possible, with the Legislative Bureau as the center, began to prepare various implementation items after the closing of the Diet. On the 19th, it was decided at the Cabinet meeting to implement the Wartime Emergency Measures Law and the date of implementation of the Wartime Emergency Measures Law. After adapting to the points amended at the Diet, the provision on the function of the Wartime Emergency Measures Committee in Article 4 of the bill was revised. It was then passed by the plenary meeting of the Privy Council on the 20th. The Japanese government announced it in the official gazette on the 22nd. Thus, this epoch-making extraordinary legislative Wartime Emergency Measures Law will be widely implemented in the mainland, Korea, and Taiwan starting from the 23rd.

Tokyo, 22nd (Central News Agency) – The Yodobashi Ward team of the Tokyo Metropolitan National Volunteer Corps was established today. With this, all 35 ward teams in Tokyo have been formed. In addition, 1,580 service teams in the textile industry have also been formed early. The overall service system of the entire textile industry in Tokyo has been largely completed. The Japanese authorities issued a mobilization order for this on the 22nd. The Tokyo Metropolitan National Volunteer Corps headquarters is scheduled to convene various cadres on the 23rd to review various matters, with the aim of dispatching them to various war-stricken areas within days to fulfill their mission.

### Communication: Impressions of Eastern Zhejiang (6) – A Ramble in Xiangshan

— Yifei

Before the changes, transportation from Ningbo to Xiangshan was extremely convenient. The two places are only a hundred or so li apart, with a highway connecting them, and a car could reach the destination in about three hours. Currently, due to the special circumstances, the highway is damaged, and one must detour to reach Xiangshan, which takes up to two days. The security on land is still relatively stable, but the sea route is rife with pirates, especially the section from Xiangxiatan to Huangxi after crossing the sea from Fenghua, which is the most dangerous. The most recent robbery occurred on the western day (May 24th) before the reporter left Fenghua. At that time, in addition to the loss of property, the travelers were stripped of their clothing as well.

The reporter only made a brief stay in Fenghua and set off from Fenghua County on May 28th, arriving at Xiangxiatan at 3:00 PM. That day, he stayed in a small hotel facing the pier. Such hotels are simply equipped, with only a bed and a table in the room, and no signboard outside.

From here, one crosses the sea to Huangxi in Xiangshan County, a journey of about seven hours. The speed of the boat depends on the size of the tide, and the departure time from both shores varies from day to day. On the eighth and twenty-third days of each lunar month, sailings are suspended due to the lack of tide. On the ninth day, the anchor is raised at dawn, and the departure time is delayed by three hours each day thereafter, in a recurring cycle, demonstrating the wonders of creation.

The next day at dawn, the reporter, braving the wind and wearing the moonlight, followed the travelers and boarded a sailboat, drifting across this vast Xiangshan Port. Midway, they frequently saw small boats sailing towards them in the distance, causing suspicion and fear. The travelers were all very nervous, with a sense of impending doom, but fortunately, the journey was smooth. They finally arrived at Huangxi on the coast around 8:00 AM, but it was still fifteen li from the county seat, so they had to change to rickshaws, which took another hour and a half to complete the journey. The terrain of Xiangshan is connected to the mainland on the southeast and west sides, and faces the sea on the north side. The Central Government stipulated that "Shibu Town," which belongs to Xiangshan, be assigned to Nantian County. (Note: This is a newly established county, and its jurisdiction includes part of Xiangshan and villages along the coast of Ninghai County.) Therefore, it is slightly smaller than before. Currently, the entire county has only one town and thirty-six townships. The county seat is located in Dancheng Town.

Dancheng is an ancient city, named after its shape resembling a "dan" character, hence it is also called "Dan City." The city walls are as round as a "dan," with the northern part protruding, resembling a "horn," with a circumference of about seven li. There are many famous historical sites, the most famous being the North Temple outside the North City Gate, which houses huge statues of the Four Heavenly Kings, made by famous Ming Dynasty artisans. Outside the East City Gate is the East Temple, which is magnificent and extraordinary. Outside the West City Gate is "Cliff House," a natural cave on high ground, where villagers gather on the Double Ninth Festival. Outside the South Gate is a large plain with thousands of acres of fertile land, stretching as far as the eye can see.

Land Rental Relations

The entire county of Xiangshan has about two million mu of farmland, and Dancheng has more than five thousand mu. The relationship between landlords and farmers is different from other places. There is no distinction between large and small fields. Before planting, the tenant farmers submit a written note, commonly known as a "rent ticket," with a format roughly as follows: "Rent voucher for ×× jin of grain, for verification. Date ××× signed." If the landlord is dissatisfied with the tenant in the following year (due to poor farming or rent arrears), they can notify the tenant at the end of the year to take back the land and dispose of it as they see fit, and the tenant has no right to object, which is different from the situation in Shaoxing, Ningbo, and Fenghua. As for the amount of rent grain, it is calculated as follows: The best-quality fields require 300 jin of grain for both the upper and lower seasons throughout the year; the upper-middle-quality fields require 250 jin of grain for both seasons. Fields with only one season of rent require 100 jin. The price of land is currently 200,000 yuan per mu for the best-quality fields.

Xiangshan has always been a rice-producing area. In the past, the rice produced in the entire county could supply the local population for a year and a half. Now, due to the relationship of rice sales and supply, and the stationing of troops in the area, the rice is often transported to other places for sale in large quantities for profit, causing food shortages during the lean season. On the day the reporter arrived, the price of rice in Xiangshan County had risen to 400,000 yuan (it was only around 50,000 yuan in April).

Xiangshan's Famous Products

Xiangshan produces many things, such as maozhu bamboo, firewood, sweet potatoes, and sugarcane, all in large quantities. The former comes from the western part of the county, and nearly a hundred large sailing boats transport it to Shanghai for sale each month. The latter comes from the eastern part of the county and is sold exclusively to Danyang and Zhenjiang in Jiangsu Province. In addition, "Xianan Township" also produces salt. The most famous products are the yellow croaker dried fish (commonly known as "fish fragrance" or "white ginseng") from Juexi, thirty li from the county seat, and the iodine mines (i.e., green stone mines) in Wushishan, Maoyang Village. Juexi produces a large amount of yellow croaker dried fish. Recently, the tax on each boat is about 100,000 yuan, so the amount is quite considerable, which often leads to covetousness from various parties. Conflicts arise from the conflict of interests, and the last major clash occurred in March of this year during the fish season. The local area is troubled, and the common people suffer.

A Glimpse of People's Livelihood

The lives of the people in Xiangshan are no different from those in other parts of eastern Zhejiang. The rich cannot bear the heavy taxes and levies and flee, while the poor are left to be exploited and struggle on the brink of starvation. The former are the gentry and wealthy merchants, who are now facing "military grain," "allocations," "operating expenses" (supplying the army with food, oil, vegetables, etc.), and "temporary loans." Recently, a so-called "contingency fund" has been created. For example, a local squire with a hundred mu of land often has to pay tens of thousands of yuan for the "contingency fund." The authorities often demand immediate payment, or else they will be detained as hostages. Therefore, the gentry are afraid of them like tigers and can only passively resist, fleeing with their families. Although the poor do not have the "glory" of "allocations" and "loans," it is not easy to make a living under rising prices.

### Japanese Troops Continue to Fight Fiercely on Okinawa Island; Air Force Fiercely Attacks Enemy Ships

Tokyo, 22nd (Central News Agency dispatch) – In the southern Shimajiri area of Okinawa Island, the enemy forces, with the joint support of aircraft and warships, continue to attack fiercely, actively attempting to penetrate the central part of the battlefield, and are gradually launching attacks towards the south. The Japanese garrison forces are in difficult circumstances, but their morale is exceptionally high. From the highlands of Aragaki and Maehira to Mabuni and Kodo, and from the 81st Highland north of Makabe Village to the area south of Maeri on the west coast, they have formed a strong defense and are engaging in fierce battles with the enemy forces.

Ryukyu Islands Base, 22nd (Central News Agency dispatch) – The Japanese air force has repeatedly attacked enemy ships in the vicinity of Okinawa from the evening of the 21st to the dawn of the 22nd. Among them, special attack units daringly attacked two enemy battleships and one unidentified type of warship. Torpedo attack units launched deadly attacks on one enemy cruiser and one unidentified type of warship, causing great damage to the enemy.

Central News Agency dispatch – According to a Washington broadcast, United Press reporter E. G. Halon reported from the island on the 20th that large-scale fierce battles are now taking place in the northern part of Okinawa Island, covering an area of more than 500 square miles. With the support of artillery, cannons, and aerial bombing, the American troops are pouncing on the Japanese forces. The enemy's 27th Infantry Division is advancing into the northern region, crossing mountainous dense forests. This front line is 30 li from the northern end of the southern front line. American troops who usually fight in the mountainous areas are assisting the frontal troops in attacking Japanese strongholds. However, the Japanese strongholds are located in the 1,100-foot-high Mount Kushi, and the 2nd Artillery Division of the Japanese army is currently participating in this arduous battle.

### Stilwell Succeeds as Commander of the US Tenth Army

### Japanese Commando Unit Crosses the Sea for Night Raid

Southern Frontline Base, 22nd (Central News Agency dispatch) – The control of the waterways between Palau and Peleliu Islands has a great impact on the enemy's operations in the Philippines and Borneo, and on the supply of the Mariana base, both now and in the future.

On that night, the Japanese close combat assault team was divided into three groups, infiltrating the north, east, and northeast sides of the island using ambush tactics. They departed from their positions on the opposite shore in heavy rain at 8:00 PM. Because they could not use the mobility of boats, each member of the close combat team tied their weapons to their backs and swam forward in the heavy rain. After about three hours, they reached the landing point. The close combat team suddenly broke into the enemy's position, destroyed their main locations, and repeatedly engaged in close combat, killing and wounding more than 210 enemy soldiers, destroying two artillery pieces, one artillery tractor, three tanks, and eleven tents. This was the great achievement of the close combat team. At that time, the enemy had not expected the Japanese army to swim across the sea for a night raid, resulting in panic and disarray.

Although they are under severe sanctions from the authorities, these fellows are unafraid of the law and are still plotting behind the scenes.

### Public Official Coerces Civilian Property: Case Cracked

Regarding the case of Zhang Da San, the main perpetrator who coerced civilian property and was executed by firing squad yesterday by the Shanghai Branch of the National Government Special Court, this reporter went to the court to inquire about the truth in order to understand the circumstances of the crime. The person in charge of the court granted an interview.

Framing Villagers

According to the discussion, Zhang Da San was a current public official who caused his own death by associating with bad friends. It is said that Yang Xunye, who used to be an interpreter in the Pudong Garrison Team, had recently been unemployed and was living idly. He thought that his nephew Zhou Chuanran (i.e., Yang Chuanran) often traded cotton and rice between Pudong and Shanghai, and that rice merchants and villagers from his hometown often came to Shanghai with him. He believed that these villagers were ignorant and could be framed as guerrillas and extorted for huge sums of money. Therefore, he agreed with Zhou Chuanran that if any villagers came to Shanghai, he should be notified immediately. He was also afraid that his individual strength was too weak to achieve his goal, so he invited Zhang Fengsan to participate when the time came. On March 17 of this year, when Zhou Chuanran was helping fellow villagers Zou Bingwen, Qian Maosheng, Yang Yunzhang, and others to come to Shanghai, he learned that Qian Maosheng and Yang Yunzhang had checked into Room 67 of the Anshang Hotel on Yongping Road, and Zou Bingwen had checked into Room 72 of the Xinxin Hotel on Da Shanghai Road. Because he also lived in Room 80 of the Hexinxin Hotel. At about 10 p.m., when the fellow villagers were playing mahjong in their room, he went to Yang Xunye and told him where the fellow villagers were. Yang Xunye went to Room 327 of the Yazhou Hotel, where Zhang Da San often stayed, and asked him to arrest them quickly. He also invited Liu Changchun and Jiang Hengrong, who were also public officials in the room but had already left their posts, to go together. Zhang Da San then carried handcuffs, and the four of them went to Room 67 of the Anshang Hotel, pointing out that Qian Maosheng and Yang Yunzhang were colluding with the guerrillas. They took them to Room 10 of the Hexing Hotel, pretending to arrest Zhou Chuanran as well. Then they went to Room 72 and threatened Zou Bingwen in the same way, taking him away as well. Along the way, they claimed that they were taking them to a certain place and then transferring them to the military police.

Detention and Extortion

Qian Maosheng and others were very frightened when they heard this and asked for help. They were taken to Room 434 on the fourth floor of the Yazhou Hotel, which was temporarily opened, and detained there. Qian Maosheng's wrists were handcuffed to show intimidation. After Qian Maosheng and others lost their freedom, Yang Xunye and others planned to extort 500,000 yuan from them. Zou Bingwen first handed over 80,000 yuan in cash that he was carrying, and the remaining 420,000 yuan was the responsibility of Zhou Chuanran to issue checks to pay for. Their residence permits were also detained as collateral. After Yang Xunye obtained the 80,000 yuan in cash, he took it to Room 327 and handed it over to Zhang Da San. Later, he claimed to Qian Maosheng and others that he still needed to thank them with 100,000 yuan for running around to help with this matter. The next day, Zhou Chuanran received 50,000 yuan in cash from Qian Maosheng and issued eight checks for 50,000 yuan each from the Puzuo Agricultural and Commercial Bank, totaling 400,000 yuan. He quickly delivered them along with the cash to Yang Dongye to transfer to Zhang Da San. The two checks, totaling 100,000 yuan, were kept for his own use.

Arrested on the Spot

After Qian Maosheng reported the matter to the Huxi Military Police, on the 19th, when Zou Bingwen was paying Zhou Chuanran 150,000 yuan in cash and a 75,000 yuan check from the Shanghai Huiyuan Bank at the Hexinxin Hotel, he was arrested on the spot by the Japanese Military Police. He was sent to the police station and then presented to the mayor of this city, who submitted it to the National Government for trial by this court. After this court completed the trial, it submitted the verdict and case file to the Chairman of the National Government for review. Just recently, an order was received from the National Government, and the execution was carried out today (the 22nd). However, Yang Xunye, who initiated the crime, was not sentenced to death because he was not a current public official.

If the planned goals are not achieved, we will strengthen or supplement them at any time. We will adhere to the principle of "resolving and acting" to achieve the purpose of the meeting.

Ensuring Public Security

(Q) The banditry in various counties has not been quelled, which is of great importance to the people's livelihood. Does your office have any specific plans to ensure public security?

(A) Although the banditry in various counties has not been quelled, each has its own special circumstances, and the weakness of military force, the unsound organization of the intelligence network, and the failure to earnestly promote Baojia work, resulting in the inability to establish public security, are also major reasons. This administrative meeting discussed this issue. However, how to take effective precautions, the methods are currently being formulated into specific plans. The plans to be taken are nothing more than: Strengthening the military strength of each county and coordinating the replenishment of guns and ammunition. Organizing a strict intelligence network to detect various intelligence. Strictly implementing household registration change registration, reviewing and randomly checking household registration, so that bandits cannot hide. Strengthening the Baojia self-defense corps and encouraging the people to automatically search for bandit traces, so that the military and civilians can unite and jointly bear the responsibility of maintaining local public security. Strictly formulating reward and punishment methods.

Eliminating Gambling

(Q) It seems that the gambling trend in various counties and districts has not been completely eliminated. How does your office plan to crack down on it?

(A) The county and district's smoking and gambling industries have been strictly prohibited by this office in accordance with the measures agreed upon in the police talks and submitted to the municipal government for promulgation. Afterwards, the county magistrates of each county should be instructed to instruct the police bureau to strictly prohibit them.

Teacher Treatment

(Q) At this administrative meeting, there were many issues concerning the Xingying matters in the counties and districts, but among them, improving teacher treatment and promoting Yijiao were the most fundamental considerations. I wonder if there is a whole Fang Zou method, and what is the method?

(A) Regarding the issue of improving teacher treatment, we are currently planning to work with the Municipal Education Bureau and the Finance Bureau to draft measures based on the actual situation and submit them to the government for review and implementation. What can be reported at present is that the mayor can issue the salary rice for teachers and staff of county-run schools from July onwards, equivalent to that of civil servants.

Police Uniforms

(Q) It is heard that police uniforms in various counties are being recruited locally. In order to maintain the dignity of the municipal government and prevent corruption, please order the municipal government to stop this and also unify the Ning method.

(A) Regarding the police uniforms of various counties, the municipal government has previously requested the Executive Yuan to allocate them together with the fabrics required by the municipal police, which has been approved and is being handled by the Municipal Cotton Federation. The above-mentioned fabrics have been issued this month according to the requested quantity and are currently being rushed to be made by the municipal government's merchants. It is expected that they will be distributed in early July, so there is a unified method in fact. As for the police uniforms of the various counties and districts that have been manufactured and issued on their own, they were handled by the police bureau according to the measures agreed upon at the police talks, and the county government prepared an estimate and submitted it to the government for record, because it was not known when the allocated cloth could be received. However, since the end of last month, the municipal government has ordered all counties and districts that have requested self-financing to stop and wait for unified handling.

Troop Supply

(Q) For the issue of supplying local troops in various counties and districts, merchants are often asked to donate advance funds, but the receiving agencies have never published the accounts, causing much public resentment and repeated disturbances. The municipal government should pay attention to this.

(A) This issue was raised by Nanhui County at this administrative meeting to stipulate the method. It has been resolved that this office will work with the Finance Bureau to draft detailed measures and submit them to the government for instructions.

Emergency Repair of Seawalls

(Q) The Saisan Seawall is in imminent danger. Please ask the municipal government to quickly raise funds for emergency repairs. The funds can be used for the pig tax designated for seawall expenses.

(A) Regarding the repair of seawalls, the Baoshan County Government raised it at this administrative meeting, and it has been resolved to submit it to the government for review, and it has been resolved that the office can decide by the government.

### Yijiao Association Hosts Free Middle School Summer Class: Opening Summer Classes for Four Levels of Junior and Senior High School First

Recognizing the large number of out-of-school youth, the Free Education Committee of this newspaper is eager to find ways to provide relief. In the spring, it discussed establishing several free middle schools in suitable locations, but it has been unable to implement this due to the difficulty in renting school buildings. Now, Ms. Yuan Aiyu, the principal of Lujia Road Free Elementary School at 10 Hejiaqiao, Fahuadong Town, has generously agreed to lend four classrooms, each capable of accommodating 50 people. The school building is spacious, well-lit, and has a beautiful environment, about one mile from the end of Taishan Road, making transportation convenient. This association has decided to first try running summer classes, enrolling three levels of junior high school and one level of senior high school, with 50 students in each level.

### The Modern All-Seeing Eye: Radio Wave Warning Device

"Detected! One hundred and seventy degrees, zero hundred kilometers, sensitivity two."

"Understood, continue tracking!"

-- Orders issued without a moment's respite in the command center.

In an instant, a soldier from a certain radio wave warning team tenses his eyes and ears, focusing intently on the "Braun tube." It turns out that the radio wave warning device, crystallized from the essence of science, has now detected an enemy aircraft zero hundred kilometers away over the southern ocean.

High on a cloud-piercing mountain, the receiving tower rotates slowly, as if pulled by invisible threads. Inside this receiving tower is something called a "Braun tube," ingeniously constructed. It can be said to be the soul of the radio wave warning device.

In the center of the receiving room, a circular object extends through the roof, resembling the periscope of a submarine. "One hundred and seventy degrees," "One hundred and sixty degrees."

Function of New Weapon

"That pole is the receiving tower. This is the Braun tube," M, a lieutenant, explained to me, who was accompanying me on the tour. Looking into the tube, I saw a pale blue light in the lens. When the light aligns with the scale at forty degrees, it is called "sensitivity one;" at forty degrees, it is called "sensitivity two." When an aircraft enters the radio wave range of the warning device, the light in the tube refracts and changes. Because of the slowly moving silk thread, the position of the enemy aircraft can be immediately determined.

The soldier rotated the handle, and the image in the Braun tube changed constantly. Above, the pointer on the large map rotated like a clock hand. On the map, thin lines radiated out in all directions from the base, each line marked with degrees. A soldier next to the map looked at where the pointer stopped and confidently made a judgment. This is something that the British and Americans cannot do; only we, the miraculous Japanese soldiers, are capable of. Generally speaking, the faint light indicates a high-altitude B29, while the dense light mostly indicates a smaller aircraft. Also, intensely flickering light indicates a small aircraft, while slowly flickering light indicates a large aircraft. If the tip of the light shows a branching shape, then the incoming enemy aircraft is sure to be a formation. However, in reality, these changes are extremely subtle, appearing and disappearing, making it difficult to be sure."

How incredible, I never imagined it would be so mysterious! And the skill of the team members' observation is even more admirable to the reporter.

Life in the Warning Team

Lieutenant M, who led the tour, told me about the daily life of the radio wave warning team as he escorted me down.

It is said that one squad has about ten members, divided into two groups, alternating every two hours. While on duty, they concentrate all their energy on their eyes, peering at the Braun tube. Even during mealtimes, food is brought from the barracks. Even during rest periods, they are not allowed to go out. When off duty, the soldiers never idle; they still have to dig trenches, cook food, and do other chores. The captain is very caring towards them.

Later, we visited Captain So-and-so, the team leader. Walking into the barracks, every soldier's face shone with excitement. It turned out that another squad's radio wave warning device had caught an enemy aircraft. Hurrying into the command room, it was filled with the sounds of telephones, telegraph keys, and commands.

"Flight number one (the order in which the enemy aircraft were detected), one hundred and seventy degrees, zero hundred kilometers, sensitivity two."

"Understood, continue tracking."

"Flight number three, one hundred and eighty degrees, zero hundred kilometers, sensitivity three, Fukui ten kilometers, high brightness, branched tip."

"Understood, continue tracking."

The captain had a war map spread out on his desk, covered with a sheet of glass. The tracks of the enemy aircraft were drawn on the glass. Based on the information obtained, models of B29s and small aircraft were moved back and forth on the board. "It's a formation, today's enemy aircraft!" Lieutenant M said.

The captain constantly responded to the reports from the radio wave warning device squads, giving necessary orders. At the same time, he reported to a certain headquarters.

"Is this the operations room? The enemy aircraft are a formation of B29s guided by small aircraft," the captain said confidently into the phone.

Two or three minutes later, air defense information was transmitted by radio.

Red lines on the map indicated that the enemy aircraft were approaching the Japanese mainland. Suddenly, a target changed direction and headed south. "Track!" "Stop tracking at × minutes!" "Alert from × degrees to × degrees!" All the actions of the enemy aircraft were monitored, and the movements of the main targets were reported quickly and accurately. Before long, the enemy aircraft flew into the range of visual observation.

"Approximately thirty P51s leading four B29s are invading the mainland from Kujukuri Beach." Hearing the radio report, a smile finally appeared on the captain's face. The soldiers also rejoiced.

Needed for Air Defense

In an instant, friendly air force units began to engage the enemy. All the officers and men were concerned about the results of the battle and the damage incurred. However, the warriors of this unit had no offensive weapons, except to silently wish success to those active on the air defense lines.

The captain said to me: "Our work is inconspicuous, but its importance, you must understand. Our creed is to not let a single enemy aircraft slip through our warning network. Moreover, regarding this point, we have full confidence. After accurately detecting the enemy aircraft, we hope that everyone will make every effort in air defense activities to minimize damage. Only when the enemy's losses are great and our own damage is minimal do we feel that our work is gloriously unparalleled." (Translated from the June 22nd issue of the "Continental New Daily")

### Record of Swimming Across the Sea Off Okinawa

At the end of April, when the battle for the Kerama Islands was intense, a Japanese unit commander, in order to contact the headquarters, swam alone across eight li of sea. On the way, he encountered several enemy boats and patrolling aircraft, but fortunately, he was able to avoid their attention and successfully reached Okinawa Island, completing his mission. His firm, fearless willpower and indomitable fighting spirit truly represent the character of Japanese soldiers. Here is a record of his experience:

When the enemy Americans landed on Kerama, some of the women and children among the island's residents who could not directly participate in the battle immediately retreated to the mountains to assist in rear-area duties such as securing food. Almost no one on the island did not participate in the battle, even elementary school students sharpened bamboo into spears, picked up weapons, and charged into enemy lines with the garrison. At the same time, they collected various metal containers such as tin cans and made hand grenades to attack the enemy.

生死問題置諸腦後

The department commander needed to take personal charge for contacting and reporting the local situation at headquarters on Okinawa Island, so one day in late April, he left and took advantage of the dark, moonless night to cross the enemy sentry line and swim alone across the sea between Kerama and Okinawa Islands, a distance of approximately eight li. His boldness and bravery were worthy of a Japanese samurai. In his heart, he had already discarded the question of life and death. He only remembered one thing: those underage elementary school students, holding hand grenades, charged into enemy lines alongside Japanese soldiers, carrying out a final attack. This tragic scene was clearly imprinted on his heart. He was determined to convey the heroic actions of these youngsters to the rear.

The squad leader set out when the weather was already clear. He infiltrated the enemy line in the darkness, safely passed the heavily guarded sentry lines, and groped his way forward until he finally reached the coastline. However, the difficulties were yet to come! Could the department leader, who had full confidence in his swimming skills, safely cross this rough sea? The surging waves crashed against the giant rocks. Even in the darkness, the white waves could be clearly seen. In these turbulent waves, it was said that there were also schools of man-eating sharks. This eight-li stretch of water was fraught with dangers, no different from a dragon's pool or tiger's den. Moreover, enemy American patrol aircraft were constantly flying and searching day and night in the sky, and enemy fleets loaded with soldiers, weapons, and supplies were constantly traveling back and forth. Could he avoid the enemy's attention? Heaven knew! However, with an important mission ahead, he did not care about any difficulties in the future.

A Leap Into The Alarming Waves

The squad leader quietly went to the water's edge, took off his night clothes, strapped on his military sword, and prepared to commit suicide immediately if he was discovered by the enemy. Other than this, he only carried a little candy and raw rice, wrapped in oil paper. When he was prepared, he leaped into the alarming waves. Although it was the sea of the southern country, the seawater was still cold in the April night. The moonlight was blocked by dark clouds, and the sea was as dark as ink, almost like a heavy rain. Fortunately, the Big Dipper was still shining in the sky. The department leader was indeed very strong and almost never knew what fatigue was, but after swimming hard for an hour or two, his head began to spin. He heard the sound of the ships, which had passed by many times, because he couldn't see anything in the dark. The commander clearly saw the approaching hull. Soon, he could hear the enemy soldiers talking. The leader quickly turned over and hid under the wreckage of the enemy ship that he was holding onto. After the enemy ship had passed, he floated back to the surface of the sea to breathe. Fortunately, the moon was hidden in the clouds, and the sea was pitch black, so he was spared from being discovered and escaped the danger.

More than twenty enemy boats had just passed, followed by the rumble of a squadron of aircraft, shaking the cold air of the sea at dawn. The dense clouds covering the sky had faded at some point, and a crimson dawn began to appear on the eastern horizon. Five squadrons of small aircraft flew in the sky where the sun was about to rise. Perhaps they were enemy Grumman carrier-based aircraft. The leader looked up at the sky. Didn't he see Japanese aircraft in his pupils? He could even see the Hinomaru markings under the wings! In an instant, a surge of heat welled up inside the leader's frozen body. He was very excited and forgot his fatigue. He raised one hand high and shouted as loudly as he could. However, the warriors on the aircraft did not know that on this sea there was their brave comrade in arms, carrying a great mission, swimming as hard as he could. They flew in a neat formation all the way to the west, instantly passing over the department leader's head. They were probably a special attack force heading to attack enemy ships. The squad leader stopped stroking the water and temporarily forgot himself, watching his friendly aircraft until he could no longer see their silhouettes. His big eyes unconsciously shed tears, and his nasal cavity felt a surge of acid. He was not sentimental, but the great reality was too exciting for him.

Use Enemy Corpses to Conceal Yourself

The squad leader continued to swim forward with all his strength. He didn't know how much time had passed. The sun was already high in the sky. Although the weather still contained the risk of sudden changes, the strong sunlight of the tropical southern country occasionally shone through the gaps in the clouds, illuminating the sea. The ice-cold seawater gradually warmed up. At this time, the squad leader heard the sound of aircraft again. This time, it was not friendly aircraft, because it was clearly the roar of a large four-engine aircraft. Looking up, it was indeed an enemy American PBY large bomber. The altitude was only a few hundred meters. It seemed to be flying from Aka Island. Before this, the squad leader had encountered many drowned enemy soldiers' corpses along the way. At this time, there was also an enemy soldier's body floating near him, probably dead for less than two or three days. He swam near a giant dead body with yellow hair and used him to conceal himself, in order to fool the eyes of enemy aircraft. His plan actually succeeded, and he escaped the danger safely again.

Major Mission Finally Completed

Before long, the low hills of southern Okinawa Island appeared in the squad leader's eyes. Since last night, he had been swimming and swimming, not knowing how many times he had almost fallen into the abyss of despair, but now, the destination was finally in sight. In order to complete the major mission he was carrying, this daring act finally had results. If he was exhausted and died here, then it would really be "failing after piling up nine mountains," a "one basket short of success." However, he was extremely hungry, and his fatigue had reached its peak. His whole body was numb and had lost all feeling, and the movements of his limbs were no longer agile. However, relying on his strong willpower, his numb hands and feet still stroked and paddled.

The residents of Okinawa Island discovered the squad leader, carrying a military sword and completely naked, lying on the coast near So-and-so, when it was already that evening. (Special correspondents Yagi and Fujita) (Translated from the May 20th issue of the "Mainichi Shimbun")

### Overview of the County Administration Office's Rent Administration Policies

— Cai Gengshun

The policies implemented by this office in the past two months can be summarized as follows: 1. General administrative work; 2. Rectification of police work; 3. Coordination and guidance of land tax collection in kind. These are described in detail below:

(A) General Administrative Work

Inspection of various counties and districts: Since its establishment, this office has been eager to understand the educational status and local conditions of various counties and districts to provide a reference for policy implementation. Following the Mayor's orders, inspections were conducted in the southeast districts on May 8th, 11th, 15th, 19th, and June 5th. After each inspection, a detailed report was prepared, listing the progress of work related to residents, civil affairs, pao-chia, police, and land tax in each county, and submitted to the Mayor for review. Recently, an administrative meeting was held. The remaining counties and districts that have not been inspected will be visited separately in the near future.

Convening of Administrative Meetings: In order to strengthen county administration and improve efficiency, an administrative meeting was convened on June 15th, bringing together the county magistrates and the heads of district public offices. All central issues were carefully discussed in light of practical needs for the Mayor's selection. The resolutions of the meeting have been organized and will be reported and implemented separately. The progress of the resolutions will be announced regularly.

Strengthening Pao-Chia Work: During inspections of various counties and districts, this office found that pao-chia work was not fully up to ideal standards. The city government also felt that command was not satisfactory. Therefore, in conjunction with the Pao-Chia Committee, measures were proposed. All pao-chia monthly donations will continue to be collected in accordance with the methods used in the city, and the principle of "taking from the local area and using it for the local area" will be followed. Standards for the salaries, office expenses, and other costs of the staff involved have been set, and the proposal is currently being reviewed by the government. Once approved, it will be implemented across the board.

Increasing the Salaries of Public Servants in Various Counties: Regarding this issue, the Mayor has agreed to provide the same salaries as public servants in the city, effective from July 1st, so that they can work with peace of mind.

(B) Rectification of Police Work

The rectification of police work in various counties is one of the key focuses of this office's policies. After this office convened the executive meeting on April 20th, the question of whether each county recognizes its reorganization and whether there are acts of outward compliance but inward disobedience must be constantly investigated. Secret agents were dispatched to various counties for secret investigations and honest reports to achieve the goal of eradicating abuses and purifying customs.

Manufacturing and Issuing Uniforms: The uniforms for the police in the city and various counties have been approved by the Executive Yuan upon the request of the municipal government. The Municipal Cotton Control Committee has allocated materials based on the requested quantities. The goods were shipped in early June, and the municipal government is currently inviting merchants to rush production of the uniforms for the police in various counties. It is expected that they can be distributed to the police in early July.

Repairing Firearms: The issue of police firearms and ammunition in various counties was discussed and resolved at the last police affairs meeting and submitted to the government for unified handling. However, it would be a waste to discard the old and broken firearms that the police stations in various counties already have and that can still be repaired. We have discussed the situation with the Central Tax Police Corps or the Municipal Police Bureau's Repairing Office, asking them to repair the firearms on our behalf. At the same time, we will still request the government to supplement the firearms separately to strengthen our capabilities.

Increasing the Office Expenses of Police Bureaus in Various Counties: The office expenses for police bureaus in various counties were previously limited and often insufficient. They urgently need to be increased. Based on the methods agreed upon at the police affairs meeting, this office drafted payment standards, uniformly increasing the original amounts tenfold. This has now been approved.

(C) Coordination and Guidance of Land Tax Collection in Kind

The collection of land tax in kind is managed by the Municipal Finance Bureau, and this office plays a coordinating role. This matter is still a novel undertaking in the city. With the exception of Shenjiang, the collection in various counties is handled by the county finance bureaus. However, in the counties, the county magistrate is the highest administrative officer, and in fact, the public trusts the county magistrate the most. In order to have the county magistrates of various counties assume real responsibility for collecting land tax in kind, in order to achieve the greatest effect and meet all the government's needs, in addition to ordering the county magistrates of each county to supervise the county finance bureaus in earnest, this office also proposed at the administrative meeting that each county organize a systematic land tax collection organization to carry out publicity, persuasion, supervision, and other work. Detailed methods will be drafted and submitted to the government for approval, and then implemented across the board.

### Dredging Rice Sources

— Lu Yi

With rice prices skyrocketing and the people's lives in dire straits, suddenly seeing the news headline, "Dredging Rice Sources, Replenishing People's Food, National Government Adopts Emergency Measures," was like rain in the sky to farmers who had suffered a long drought. After reading the June 16th editorial in this newspaper, "Supporting Emergency Rice and Grain Measures," the few suggestions provided are indeed extremely valuable. Especially the second point, regarding the issue of dredging rice sources, it states, "It is hoped that all relevant parties will promptly and effectively assume the responsibility of assisting and supervising the dredging of rice sources, especially in transportation. Military and police personnel should not only be absolutely prohibited from demanding bribes for rice and grain movement but should also provide protection at all times."

In fact, in the past, in the private transportation of rice and grain, it was indeed often hindered and extorted by illegal military and police personnel. Taking the suburbs of Shanghai as an example, according to a survey by the Xin Shen Bao, there were as many as fifty toll booths along the way. Not only did the porters suffer from exploitation, but the source of rice for the general public depended on these porters for nine out of ten parts. The impact was significant.

The source of rice in Shanghai, in addition to the suburbs, also relies heavily on the continuous supply from other rice-producing areas. In the past, the transportation of rice by ordinary porters along the Beijing-Shanghai line, although mostly in small quantities, was also subject to different restriction methods by the local authorities in each rice-producing area. For example, the restrictions in Suzhou, Changzhou, and other places were the strictest, and even ordinary people were absolutely prohibited from exporting small amounts of rice for their own consumption, even rice by-products. Sticky rice cakes, fried rice noodles, and pastries were also subject to restrictions. However, before the beginning of the Lunar New Year this year, Nanjing, Wuhu, and surrounding areas had no restrictions on transportation by ship or train, so porters flocked to transport rice, which also led to strict local bans.

As a result, ordinary porters mostly switched to transporting miscellaneous grains such as flour, red beans, and mung beans, which also helped to alleviate the food problem in Shanghai. However, although the transportation of these goods was not restricted in the place of origin, the places along the railway line unreasonably made things difficult. In addition to a few police officers (railway police) and "black hats" extorting bribes on the train, when the train arrived at the station and stopped, ordinary illegal military and police personnel openly boarded the train to forcibly seize goods (generally called "robbing the train" by porters). Not only rice and flour, but sometimes even miscellaneous grains were not spared. Under duress, everyone dared to be angry but did not dare to speak out, so ordinary porters regarded the transportation of rice and grain on the Beijing-Shanghai line as a daunting task. Here are a few points based on my personal observations:

The restriction methods for rice and grain movement should be uniformly abolished across the board, and priority should be given to them. In the past, although some local authorities did not have rice and grain restrictions, they were often subject to restrictions due to the temporary measures of the railway authorities. However, these measures were often taken by petty people for personal gain under the guise of public interest. For example, when porters exited Nanjing Railway Station, even when issuing invoices, it was often a way for a few staff members to line their own pockets. As for the regulations on the weight and area of luggage carried by train passengers in the past, they should also be relaxed and adjusted in line with the actual needs of rice and grain dredging, so that rice and grain transportation can be effectively and smoothly circulated.

### How to Solve the Current Cash Panic

The lack of cash is an inevitable phenomenon in the process of wartime currency devaluation, but if there were no profiteering merchants adding fuel to the fire, the situation would not be so serious. To eliminate this evil trend and stabilize people's livelihoods, I would like to offer the following suggestions:

The financial authorities should immediately prohibit the circulation of appropriation notes on the market within a time limit. Appropriation notes that are already circulating on the market should be deposited into banks within a time limit, and large amounts should be replaced with Central Reserve Bank (CRB) promissory notes. In the past, some banks and firms issued appropriation notes indiscriminately. Once appropriation notes are withdrawn, the use of funds is reduced, and the number of negotiable instruments circulating on the market decreases, which will not only help solve the cash panic but also help curb prices.

The CRB should issue promissory notes with denominations of whole numbers, at least one million yuan or more. The CRB should issue and redeem them based on market needs and according to the guarantee reserves of each bank and firm, so as to adjust to actual needs.

Private checks, under a certain amount, can be presented to the original bank for stamping and certification to purchase goods from stores. Stores should not refuse to accept them or use this as an excuse to raise prices. However, it must be stipulated that they must be submitted to the bank within a certain period of time after the date of issue (such as one week), and they will be invalid after the deadline to prevent forgery, loss, and other disputes, so as to supplement the shortage of cash.

The CRB should increase the supply of cash to each bank and firm in accordance with its business scope. Each bank and firm can withdraw cash for depositors according to a prescribed standard and must not refuse, such as:

A. Each week, a certain percentage of the total deposit amount can be withdrawn (such as one-tenth).

B. The number of cash withdrawals per household per week must not exceed a certain amount (such as 300,000 yuan).

C. Small depositors with a certain amount (such as 100,000 yuan) or less are not subject to restrictions on cash withdrawals.

D. When withdrawing deposits, if the remaining amount after giving CRB promissory notes is over 100,000 yuan, promissory notes should be used. If it is less than 100,000 yuan, it should be supplemented with cash.

When the CRB supplies cash to each bank and firm, it should record the serial numbers. If there is a discounting situation, the perpetrators can be investigated based on the serial numbers.

It is forbidden for stores to sell goods with double prices for cash and negotiable instruments.

Observing that there is no cash shortage panic in small cities and rural areas, it can be seen that the value of Shanghai's exports of industrial products and imports of rice and grain cannot be offset, which is also one of the reasons for the lack of cash. The government should immediately order that the transportation of non-strategic industrial daily necessities should not be detained by customs, military, and police.

In short, the lack of cash is an inevitable trend in wartime. The main factors causing it are artificial manipulation and the psychological panic of the general public. Once the CRB can supply a large amount of cash in a short period of time, people's hearts will be at ease, and the problem will be easily solved. It is also hoped that the financial authorities can break through sentimentality and thoroughly investigate the illegal profiteering activities of each bank and firm, then the cash panic will be solved easily.

### Beyond One's Station

— Cen Jia

Every day when going to school or respectfully returning home from school, Xiao Wen always lingered in front of several large bookstore doors on "Culture Street." Although this year, because his father sent his fourteen-year-old sister to the factory to work, leaving him at home to take care of his three-year-old brother, and not letting him continue his studies, he always had to linger here. What made him linger were the children's books with an emphasis on pictures displayed in the window. — Looking at the bright red and green covers of these books, it was like standing in front of "Guanshengyuan," marveling at the exquisite cakes and pastries. Xiao Wen was always used to eating and watching colorful comic strips. Before reading, after seeing those comic strips, the things at the bookstore's door, although there was no sign saying "The door opens wide, no money, no entry," Xiao Wen usually dared not enter, except to wander around outside. Once, he tried to walk in with a burst of courage, but as soon as his trembling hand touched the books on the counter, before he could even open them, a clerk shouted loudly:

"Hey kid, are you buying or not?"

"I…"

"Look—you've dirtied the books!"

"His eyes are darting around—he must be thinking of stealing!" another clerk said.

Xiao Wen was scolded until he was dizzy and didn't know how to argue, just standing there woodenly.

"Aren't you leaving yet! What are you standing there for?"

But today, Xiao Wen mustered up his courage and walked into one of the largest bookstores. He walked very lightly, afraid that the old cloth shoes on his feet would damage or stain the smooth tiles on the ground. He secretly watched to see if the clerks behind the counter were looking at him, or even coming over to chase him out. He held the hot, crumpled banknotes tightly in his pocket, ready to show them immediately if they questioned him—"I'm here to buy books."

At this time, the clerks were either busy chatting or dealing with customers, and they didn't notice him. Xiao Wen finally safely reached the children's books section.

Xiao Wen's height wasn't as tall as the counter, so the clerk who was focusing on reading the tabloid didn't notice someone approaching. Xiao Wen shouted several times, "Sir, buy, looking at the new fruits of the world in the kitchen, making people salivate for sesame cakes, fried dough sticks, and noodles, it's blurry and dull. It's more flavorful to look at these exquisite children's books. Now, he can't even look at them!" But the voice was too weak, and as soon as it came out, it disappeared. The "sir" continued to read his newspaper until a female customer walked in with high heels, and the clerk woke up as if from a dream, raised his head, and incidentally discovered Xiao Wen.

"Sir, buy books!" Xiao Wen raised the banknotes high.

"What books?" the clerk asked lazily, frowning, while still looking down at the tabloid.

"Sir, how much are these… these few?"

Almost every book was one that Xiao Wen liked, but he handed over all the money he had—which he had hidden from his parents, saving the money for the big sesame cake they gave him every morning for almost a month—and only managed to buy two thin books. —However, although the number of books was small, they were treasured books that he had longed for through the window for so long, and now he actually had them in his hands. Xiao Wen was already going crazy with joy.

He held the books tightly, rushed out with hops and skips, almost bumping into the female customer. Xiao Wen was afraid that the female customer would chase after him and hit him, so he ran even faster. But before he could step out the door, he was grabbed from behind.

"Just bought the books!"

"Just bought them? —Where's the receipt?"

"Receipt?" Xiao Wen stared at the other person with a pair of bulging eyes.

"Even a little brat like you steals things, I didn't see it coming!"

The clerk snatched the books away and raised his hand, wanting to slap him.

"It's true… you can check it out." Xiao Wen used all his strength to push away the descending hand, while reaching out to snatch back the stolen books.

As a result, thanks to the confirmation of the original clerk, the charge was finally cleared, but the complaints were unavoidable.

"Who told you to run so fast, not even wanting the receipt!"

This little humiliation couldn't diminish Xiao Wen's excitement after buying the books. He hadn't even looked at the contents yet. He really wanted to secretly open them and take a look on the road. But after looking at them, he seemed afraid that these beautiful pictures would disappear in the strong sunlight and turn into blank paper, so he had to endure it and hurry home.

Xiao Wen's home was very close to those bookstores. Soon, he arrived.

He climbed the creaking wooden staircase to the loft. The loft was as dark as a cave, with only a one-foot square window, and the glass was gone, covered with dirty yellow kraft paper, and there were several cracks in the paper. This loft was also very low, and only Xiao Wen could walk upright in it. The floor was covered with many obstacles—lead buckets, coal stoves, earthenware pots, oil bottles, and the like. If you weren't careful, you would knock something over.

At this time, Xiao Wen's parents and sister were all working in the factory, and only the two little brothers were at home. Just now, Xiao Wen had sneaked out while his brother was sleeping. Now, his brother was already awake and crying his heart out. The quilt that was supposed to prevent him from falling off the bed had been pushed to the ground. If Xiao Wen had come later, his brother would have fallen off himself.

Xiao Wen hurriedly put down the books, picked up the quilt, dusted off the dirt, wiped away the phlegm, folded it neatly, and put it on the bed. He also wiped away his brother's tears and snot, and found some empty boxes, empty cans, and cigarette cards for him to play with, finally stopping his crying. Xiao Wen then withdrew his brother, pushed the only chair away, dragged over a swaying bamboo chair, sat on it, and then carefully opened the paper package and began to read.

The first book was called "My Family,"—this was a very presentable "family": with a garden, a children's room, a reading room, a dining room, a bedroom, a kitchen... The furniture and various decorations were very novel and luxurious, and there were many things that Xiao Wen had never seen before. The children had to drink a glass of milk every morning, and in addition to three meals, there were several snacks. …When they were at home, they sometimes studied their lessons in the reading room, sometimes read interesting books and newspapers, sometimes kicked a ball in the garden, patted a badminton, sometimes the older brother and younger sister gathered together to sing and dance, sometimes they formed a circle to listen to their parents tell stories. …Their father often brought back candy and toys to share with them when he came home from work; on holidays, he often accompanied them to see plays and visit parks….

There was also a book describing the grand occasion of this family celebrating the New Year. On this day, the children all wore bright and beautiful clothes, dressed neatly. They initiated the opening of a trade fair, inviting children from school, relatives, and neighbors to participate. They used the reception room as the venue, hanging lanterns and festoons, arranging seats, and distributing candy and snacks… they were really busy for a while. When everything was ready, the children came one after another. Big

Xiao Wen slowly turned the pages one by one, carefully admiring the pictures and reading the annotations, his eyes rarely blinking. At the same time, he involuntarily stroked the pages of the book, as if he could really touch the bodies of the children in the pictures and the real objects of candy and toys.

Just as he was reading with relish and reluctant to put it down, suddenly his brother cried loudly! Xiao Wen had to get up in a hurry and find something else to coax his brother to stop crying. Then he reassembled the bamboo chair that had come apart and collapsed on the ground, and picked up the two books that had fallen on the ground and were stained with phlegm. He wiped off the phlegm with his sleeve, and then sat back in the chair and opened them to read.

Although the books were still the same, being awakened to the reality of his environment made Xiao Wen begin to compare his own family with those in the books, and he realized that the distance between the two was incomparable!

At the same time, he also realized that the children in the book seemed to have the ability to feel, and seemed to have seen the simple and dilapidated situation of Xiao Wen's home. At this moment, they were all looking at Xiao Wen with a mocking look, their every move—whether playing, eating, or reading… seemed to be secretly scolding him…

"Little beggar, stay away—you don't have this kind of luck!" Indeed, Xiao Wen had never drunk milk, and the side dishes for his meals were often just a plate of pickles or a plate of bean sprouts… In addition to a snack of porridge, his parents rarely brought back even a sesame seed-sized piece of candy for him to eat when they came home from work. When they had free time, they never told him any stories. When they opened their mouths, it was either bickering or complaining about the high cost of rice and firewood; taking their son to the park or seeing a play—don't even mention it. Chopping firewood, boiling water, carrying water, sweeping the floor, making coal balls… Xiao Wen had to do all these things; while his parents were working, he could sneak in a little play; when they came back, he had to be busy with this and that. In the evening, when he had a little free time, there was no electricity, and since his parents had to go to work early the next morning, they were not willing to light an oil lamp, so they went to bed early. And they slept on a rock-hard wooden bed…

Why did the children in the pictures live such happy lives? —This didn't seem to be without reason. He often saw children outside who looked very similar to those in the pictures. But he himself was suffering. Could he blame his parents for being useless? But they were clearly often exhausted from their work, and just wanted to sleep when they came home. Not long ago, one time when only he and his father were at home, his father coughed for a while, and suddenly coughed up a few mouthfuls of yellow phlegm with blood. Because the light was dim at the time, his father didn't notice, but Xiao Wen, who was squatting on the ground chopping firewood, saw it and finally cried out in fear. His father bent down to take a look, shook his head, sighed, and then wiped the phlegm away with his foot, and then warned Xiao Wen not to tell his mother. He still spits up phlegm from time to time, but Xiao Wen has never seen his father go to a doctor or take any medicine. Although his father often beat him and scolded him, sometimes even beating his mother, often making his mother cry, when his father was not around, his mother often held him tightly, telling him with tears in her eyes not to hate his father because of this. He was really a very upright and knowledgeable person, extremely diligent, and didn't drink or smoke. It was only because he worked like a horse and a cow that he not only couldn't make a name for himself, but even living was becoming a problem, and his heart was extremely depressed, and his attitude had changed greatly. Xiao Wen also felt that his father was not a fierce person. When the landlord came to collect rent, or the lender came to demand payment, no matter how fierce or vicious they were, his father always tried his best to be careful and begged.

The more Xiao Wen thought about it, the more he couldn't understand it. A huge question mark was cutting into his fragile heart like an iron knife.

The two books slipped from his hands to the ground at this time, but Xiao Wen didn't feel it at all.

### Life

— Ling Jiao

Please do not tell me in that sad tone: "Life is just a dream!"

Even if you say so, and regard life as an illusion, we must make this dream - with effort - become more beautiful and more vivid. Don't you want to see yourself in a dream, riding a steed high, carrying a precious sword, and overcoming everything?

### Love of a Slave

— Xiaofeng

"The love of a slave cannot blossom into a beautiful flower."

I remember these two lines from some song lyrics. At the time, after hearing them, many questions arose: Why wouldn't the love of a slave have beautiful blossoms? Aren't slaves also people? Also, what kind of people are slaves? At that time, in my naive heart, I couldn't really understand so much, so I didn't particularly like this song. When others sang it, the somber mood stimulated me, but honestly, I preferred lighter songs, those filled with exuberant emotions, that truly captivated me. I was immersed in such songs. I once sang loudly to the wilderness, under the soft moonlight, almost like a primal cry. But that was precisely a natural outpouring, humans are filled with so many emotions like joy, anger, sorrow, and pleasure, so humans sing for this reason, singing about what they love, and also singing about what they hate.

Come to think of it, quite some time has passed. I began to get closer to the noisy atmosphere, and jazz music accompanied me. Pure and sincere songs gradually left me, fading away in my memory. Some rough lyrics were also gradually forgotten. I learned affectation, and I also learned to sing some affected lyrics. Although this also contained a kind of beauty, it was a different kind of beauty. Beauty truly has many forms in the world. I pursued this kind of beauty, and I also pursued those other kinds of beauty. I also thought this was a kind of enjoyment; embracing and assimilating enriched me. I felt satisfied. I absorbed new forms of beauty while also discarding old ones.

Just like in the past, recently I listened to the ladies on the music scene twisting and wriggling as they sang, and I also listened to the low, melancholic chants carried by the wind on the lakeside. Sometimes I was excited and wanted to ask them something; sometimes I remained silent. However, I'll tell you, this is perfectly clear. In a quiet corner, I heard that long-forgotten song!

"The love of a slave cannot blossom into a beautiful flower."

Although the song's mood was still somber, it was clearly a sharp sound wave vibrating. I could imagine that it was a lively vocal cord emitting the sound. I was surprised, why not sing some bright lyrics?

Under the faint moonlight, behind that iron railing, the sound waves spread out from there. It was a girl, her hair sharply distinct in the darkness. She had no melancholy mood at all. I knew she had a cheerful heart. She was just humming casually, she didn't appreciate the somberness of the tune, she was just singing for fun.

I politely asked her, no, I almost interrogated her:

"Girl, based on your own experience... can you understand the love of a slave?"

After that, I learned a little more. She patiently told me a lot:

"A slave isn't necessarily a servant, nor necessarily a prisoner of war, nor necessarily those stories about slaves in history...

"As long as love is built on a foundation of money, it will not blossom into beautiful flowers and fruits."

"Why?" I still seemed to have some doubts. Every time the somber song resounded, the sharp sound waves echoed around me, and I was disturbed by this discordant song.

### Spring

— Lin Qi

A rumor was spreading in the Senior Year Two classroom at the Linzhong High School: Chen Shijia was pursuing Xu Meiwen.

When everyone talked about this rumor, they would unconsciously glance at Xu Meiwen in the front, and then sneak a peek at that guy in the suit in the back.

Xu Meiwen sat in the first row, so people behind could see her immediately. Xu Meiwen was currently copying from the algebra notebook of Huang Guifen, who was sitting next to her.

So, that Lao Ling showed disdain and curled his lips, saying:

"What's so great about Xu Meiwen? Copying algebra from others."

"Ah Q!" someone defended her. "You can't get her yourself, so you're just jealous."

Everyone burst into laughter. Then someone else turned around to look at Chen Shijia.

That guy in the suit was buried in a novel by Zhang Ziping, not hearing what others were saying. He was using all his energy to memorize the sentences. When he saw a female name, he would think of Xu Meiwen's dimples.

At this moment, he had just finished a short story, so he asked Fan Zhen next to him:

"Hey! Strategist! Do you think Zhang Ziping writes well?"

Here, it's necessary to introduce Fan Zhen. He was Chen Shijia's strategist and secretary. The letters Chen Shijia sent to female classmates were all taken care of by Fan Zhen. Therefore, that young master in the suit called the literary figure "Strategist."

Fan Zhen was a literary figure, so he naturally didn't take anything seriously.

"Zhang Ziping? Shh!" He smiled disdainfully. "It's always the same old thing."

Chen Shijia felt happy. He suddenly thought that those letters Fan Zhen wrote for him must be effective. But—

"But she still hasn't replied yet. -- It's been a week and three days."

"What's the rush?" The strategist comforted him. "Is everything in the world that easy?"

Indeed, nothing in the world is easy. Take his situation as an example. For that Xu Meiwen, how much thought and time had he spent? At first, he just followed her after school, following her to the entrance of the alley, watching Xu Meiwen go in. He stood there for a while, then came back. Then, he looked for opportunities to talk, but he didn't know how. Until now, he hadn't officially spoken a single word to her. Finally, the strategist taught him a trick: write a letter. However, it had been another week and three days with no reply.

"Xu Meiwen is actually so difficult?" Chen Shijia thought to himself.

However, only heaven knows. Xu Meiwen was not difficult at all. At this time, Xu Meiwen was thinking about her father's furious face:

"What is this?" The old man shouted loudly, clutching the five torn pieces of letters in his hand. "Although our family isn't doing so well now, we've always been a scholarly family for generations. I can't let people laugh at me for having no discipline!"

Xu Meiwen didn't know anything, not even who wrote them. But her father even limited her to reply within three days, but she didn't know what to do.

Huang Guifen told her that people in the classroom were spreading "rumors" about her, so Xu Meiwen guessed half of the truth. Plus, in the past few days, people often liked to shout her name together with Chen Shijia's name, for example, Wang Jianzhang often shouted for no reason:

"Chen Shijia! Have you seen Xu Meiwen's composition book?"

Then everyone would burst into laughter again.

Chen Shijia had once very generously promised everyone that if things were successful, everyone would get to eat ten candies. Therefore, for the sake of ten candies, everyone hoped things would be successful.

Although there were also many people who were not very enthusiastic. Yu Cunzhi had said:

"Chen Shijia's way of love is wrong! This is a business transaction, a temporary impulse, not love!"

He could say what he wanted, but few people listened to him. As soon as Yu Cunzhi opened his mouth, it was all about common ideals, mutual encouragement, and so on, as if only he understood love.

"I advocate aestheticism," the literary figure Fan Zhen also expressed his opinion, "but it's also about the unity of body and soul, unlike Yu Cunzhi's common this and mutual that. Therefore, regarding Chen Shijia's matter, I hope to facilitate its realization in the shortest possible time. That's the key."

However, in the shortest possible time, nothing had been realized.

Everyone was eagerly waiting for those ten candies.

One day, Chen Shijia finally received a letter from Xu Meiwen.

It was very simple: My father recently tore up a letter, I believe it was written by you. To avoid future trouble for everyone, it's best to write fewer of these letters. Meiwen. Chen Shijia immediately went to find the strategist.

"This is called suppressing first and then promoting," the strategist said with a strategist's tone. "The art of war says, make the real seem illusory, and the illusory seem real. In my opinion, there's a lot of sense in this!"

"Stop putting on airs! What should we do now?"

"Act quickly. Be bold, and follow her to her house."

"Won't there be any danger?"

"Leave it to me." The strategist patted his chest.

However, Xu Meiwen didn't come that day, and she didn't come the next day either. Chen Shijia inquired and found out that she was sick.

The strategist had a flash of inspiration and came up with a plan.

"Old Chen! This time heaven has given you a great opportunity. You can walk into her house openly and honestly, saying that you're the representative of the entire class, coming to inquire about her illness."

Chen Shijia almost jumped up, and he wanted to hug Fan Zhen and shout a few times.

He bought a bunch of violets on the street, and the strategist sent him to the entrance of the alley. Then, five minutes later, Chen Shijia came out dejectedly.

"You hit a snag? Her father was home?" Fan Zhen looked at his face. "Stop the attack! I give up," the young master said dejectedly.

"What happened?" Then Chen Shijia told his strategist in detail. The first thing that caused his bad impression was that Xu Meiwen only lived in a kitchen shed, which was a mess with everything inside -- toilets, pots, everything was in there. Also, Xu Meiwen was drinking corn porridge, without even any side dishes.

"The room for the servants in our house is much cleaner than that!"

Secondly, Xu Meiwen didn't say a word to him, although her mother was still polite in entertaining him with a few words. This didn't matter. Xu Meiwen kept looking at a book, and Chen Shijia knew at a glance that the book belonged to Yu Cunzhi.

"I asked her, 'Did you borrow it from Cunzhi?' She grunted, 'Yes.' From beginning to end, I said this one sentence." "Yu Cunzhi has this trick too," the strategist said like a defeated warrior.

"So, I give up. Besides, just looking at that house is really unbearable."

The next day, Chen Shijia and others arrived at the school and spread rumors. "Hey! Did you know that Yu Cunzhi lent a lot of books to Xu Meiwen to read!"

This was naturally a new piece of news. Everyone went to ask Yu Cunzhi, and Yu Cunzhi didn't deny it at all.

"Lending books is just lending books, what's the big deal!"

"Good!" Some people shouted.

"Hmph!" The strategist Fan Zhen said: "Who doesn't know that using lending books as a guise."

"Yu Cunzhi! How many candies are you planning to give us each?"

"What are you talking nonsense about?" Yu Cunzhi blushed red. "Is lending books worth making such a fuss about?"

"Why don't you lend them to me then? Huh!" Chen Shijia found a reason.

"She borrowed them from me herself."

She went to borrow them from him herself! Chen Shijia's heart trembled. He thought: Why don't I have a book that I can lend to others? That's terrible. He, Chen Shijia, didn't have a single book. Even that novel by Zhang Ziping was borrowed from Fan Zhen.

"Chen Shijia! Don't be discouraged. Keep trying!" Someone cheered Chen Shijia on.

"Forget it!" He thought to himself: "I don't have any books, and I don't know how to say a lot of common whats and mutual whats to Xu Meiwen. What's the use of trying?"

He told this to the strategist Fan Zhen, and Fan Zhen said:

"You idiot! At this rate, you can forget about love for the rest of your life!"

Chen Shijia scratched his head and stared blankly at the strategist for a long time.

### Prelude to the Sino-Portuguese Cup Final Next Tuesday

The historic Sino-Portuguese Cup football match had a good record in the Shanghai football scene. However, since the incident, it has been silent, mainly because the authorities did not have the time for it. Until this year, the organization established by the authorities has been running smoothly, and there is a move to resume the Sino-Portuguese Cup football match, which has attracted the attention of football fans. The football skills of the Chinese and Portuguese armies always have their special appeal.

This year's cup competition still adopts the best-of-three system as in the past. The first game was played at Yiyuan Stadium on January 1, and the second game was held at the Racecourse on February 16. The former was New Year's Day, and the latter was the Lunar New Year's Day, which shows the authorities' special attention to this cup competition. However, after the second game, the two sides each won one game, and there was no follow-up for more than four months. All my fans think this is a strange thing. Until recently (21st), the authorities announced. This final battle has been decided to be held at the Racecourse Stadium at 5 pm next Tuesday (26th). There is a situation where it finally comes out after a thousand calls. Or is it that good dramas must arrive so late?

Before the competition, the author hopes that the Chinese team can win, so I dare to make a small contribution. But before discussing it, I plan to briefly supplement the situation of the first two games. The interval is long, and fans may have forgotten it, so even though it is past its prime, it can still be used as a reference.

The First Portuguese Victory

The competition was held in Yiyuan on January 1. Because it was a good time, the grand occasion was unprecedented. As a result, with a score of four to two, the Portuguese army won. In the process of scoring, China's Sun Jinshun took the lead and scored one goal, one to zero. The second goal was scored by Bao Xiutuo, one to one. The first half ended without a winner. In the second half, the first goal (the third goal) was scored by Su Ruomiao. The fourth goal, Han Longhai headed the ball into the net. The fifth goal was again scored by Su Ruo, and the sixth goal was scored by Bao Xiutuo. The total result was four to two, and the audience sighed. It was because the Chinese team was not complete that day, and many soldiers were absent. The lineup is recorded below.

Portugal

V Su Ruo, Hu Pan, Victor Costa, W Pan, Tuo Sun Li, Aowei La, Bao Xiutuo, Mi Ke Lai Tuo, A Group Ke Sha Lai, Liao Fu En

Chinese Team

(First Half) Liu Li, Ning Meng, Yang Liang, Sun Jinshun Xian, Zhang Lin, Gen Li Yichen, Han Wu Xiangqi, Zheng Yingquan, Han Longhai, Jia Youliang

(Second Half)

Li Yao

Zhang Li Tiansheng, Meng Yiliang, Luo Shoufu Bang, Li Yichen, Sun Xiaoshun Lun, Zhang Lin, Gen Zheng Yingquan, Han Longhai, Jia Youliang

Second War China Wins Big

February 16 (Abolishing Lunar New Year's Day) confronted at the racecourse. As a result, China broke the Portuguese team with a score of five to zero. But in fact, the Portuguese team's lineup was sparse. Because of the cause of the Donghua athletes, the Chinese team did not participate, and it was not seen how strong it was. Therefore, the game did not have a very satisfactory battle situation. The scorers were Yu Liming, Li Yichen. At the end of the first half, Li Yichen, Li Yichen, Gao Xiuqing. The lineup for the day is as follows.

China vs. Team

Portugal, Zhou Qilin, Yu Li, painted Gao Xiuqing, Dong Li Tiansheng Shi Meng, Liang Gao Baozheng, Jie Wu Qixiang (top) Yu Liming Yu Liming (top) (bottom) Lei Shihua

Portugal

Greenburg, Bolag, Kema, Han V Su Ruo, Sha Ke Lai Tuo Lai Yuan A, Klasha Bolayuan

The Third Silver Cup Decision

This sudden final battle has been scheduled for next Tuesday. Based on the situation of the players in recent days, it may not be possible to have the most normal state, so I dare not make a judgment on whether the performance will be wonderful. Only because this game is decisive, it is better to do it for real. The author is in the position of the press and has to talk about preparing for a rainy day. If it is really urgent, it is better than not talking about it, and I hope to win the silver cup. In the history of the ball, it cannot be changed. It is better to first review the Portuguese team's lineup. Although there may be changes, the most ideal one is the following:

Costa, V Su Ruo, Pan Victor, Tai W Pan, Sun Li, Aolie, Wei La Bao Xiutuo, Lai Ke Lai Tuo Lai Yuan

A Kelasha, Fu En

According to the above lineup, the tactical speculation of the Portuguese team is made. Even if its lineup is slightly adjusted, its combat strategy is roughly the same. Because the style of the Portuguese team is always like this. Its defenders, in addition to trying their best to block the enemy's wings, often use the trick of tempting people to offside to save energy. The two midfielders must follow the ball between the enemy's abundant. The central defender sits in the center, and at the same time, he is the rear, and his guard pattern is almost visible. On the front line, it focuses on the method of flying wings and central breakthrough. Among them, the two inside forwards retreat most of the time to serve as seven defenders to fight and carry the ball to the front line.

Knowing this, the Chinese team should prescribe the right medicine to achieve the effect of defeating the enemy. First, it may be necessary to propose a corresponding lineup. With Sun Jinshun's recent departure from Shanghai, Li Biao Qu Yongfu's injury, and Li Yichen's recent poor condition, there is a feeling of lack of talent on the front line. Looking for the next best thing, let's propose it like this.

Song Lingsheng, Liu Zuru, Zhang Wu Qixiang Luo Shoufu Bang, Xin Fuzhen, Dai Linjing Lun, Zhang Lin, Gen Han Longhai

Meng Yiliang, Jia Youliang (new force) Liu Xianhan, Zhuang Youren, Liang Shutang, Yu Liming, etc.

According to the proposed lineup, the midfielders and defenders have plenty of strength and rich experience. To block the team's two amazing activities can be competent. The two midfielders are also able to have the ability to carry the ball to help the offensive. Even more valuable is that the above five forwards should be the most reasonable ideal at the moment. Liu Guru is in very good condition recently and can be competent. Dai Linjing's center forward is indispensable, because of the strength of even Fan. Han Longhai has a fierce rush, which can be used to use the opponent's intention to use the trick of tempting the enemy offside, and it is extremely possible to rush into building power. This is to fight poison with poison. Jia Youliang has not only not retreated recently, but also has a good state, so his cut ball must have wonderful moves. Liu Zuru on the left wing is quite capable, so he can show his skills from it. As for the reason why the goalkeeper Chong Zhang Banglun, Yu is rather that Liu Xianhan may have a sense of rawness. From the point of view of Zhang's two results in the Baima team, he is still satisfactory.

The author is talking about soldiers on paper and is in the position of an observer, making sincere comments. I don't know if it can invite the authorities to look forward to it and adopt it?

### Prelude to Summer Football League War

— Shuang Dai

The Football Association has ended this football season, and as summer approaches, it will hold a summer football invitational tournament. The initial preparation was for six strong teams, Dong, Friendship. Overseas Chinese Association, Portuguese Chamber of Commerce, Warren, Shanghai Police. Now I hear that Donghua has decided not to participate. So there are only five teams. This matter has been brewing for a long time, and it can become a reality when the Football Association is in progress. Then in this summer, the people of Shanghai can still enjoy the football players galloping on the court, which is an unexpected blessing.

The purpose of the Football Association to open the football league is to enable players to have a chance to connect in the summer, not to be unfamiliar, and to have a skilled performance in the morning light of the next game, so that the level has the possibility of improvement. This method cannot be said to be inappropriate. However, I think it may be too bitter for the ball, but the Warren and Shanghai Police teams can be said to be two newly organized teams. The former is the overlord of Group C this year, and the latter was once rumored to have disintegrated. The former has drawn in famous players, and the latter has tried to make adjustments. So the two teams have become quite considerable.

Now the news has come that the two teams have scheduled a friendly match at Jiaozhou Park at 5:30 this afternoon (23rd). This may be the so-called prelude to the summer football league, and it is also an opportunity for these two new armies to give us an estimate. Whether the summer football league has appeal has a great relationship with the Taoism game.

The reporter once visited Warren Changju for an interview. According to Yao Naizhi, the person in charge, their team has gathered famous players from De Shangqiao Lian Huatong and other teams this time, and their strength is quite strong. However, coming from various teams, it is inevitable that there is a suspicion of being a rabble, so he invited the famous instructor Ma Shan'er to serve as an instructor. He uses his best teaching methods, just like printing well-filled lecture notes, and he goes to the venue every day to explain in detail according to the pictures. Really, it gives each player the opportunity to understand the ball path the most. Therefore, although they are soldiers gathered from various teams, they already have a good tacit understanding. When the time comes, I really dare not guarantee how good the results will be, but what can be guaranteed is that it will never be as bad as generally imagined.

Shanghai Police, because people like Robert Cotov Yuzhenghua left, it was rumored that it would disband at the end of the season, which made many fans regret it. This time, being able to make a comeback is enough to excite fans a little. They selected good materials from Group B and drew in a few pillars from the Jewish team, so the whole team is neat and average enough. What is worrying is whether there will be the best performance on the stage.

Today, I hope the boss blesses, don't rain, then, the Taoism friendship competition must be a ball game that fans are eager to watch. It is even more hoped by the Football Association that it will become a game and at least observe the strength of these two new armies to make a budget for the Summer Football League. Now explore and record the military appearance of the Warren Shanghai Police teams:

### Volleyball League First Division Championship - Zhongbei Individual Techniques

— (Jie)

Due to continuous rain this week, many volleyball league matches have been rescheduled. No matches were completed in the women's first division, creating an irreparable regret. Last week, I introduced the women's division champion, the Three Provinces team. Now, let's introduce the Zhongbei team, which has secured the first division championship. Looking at Zhongbei's schedule, only one match against the White team remains, while all other teams have at least two losses. Therefore, even if Zhongbei loses to the White team, it will not affect their championship title. Here is an individual introduction of each player in order.

Team Leader and Captain Wang

Zhu Zhongtao is the team leader and captain. As the name suggests, he is known to be a man of both words and action. Listening to his pre- and post-match talks to the team, they are indeed insightful. He also occasionally takes to the field, trying the position of left front. Observing his skills, it is clear that he is a veteran player. However, due to a lack of practice, his jumping block and spike can only be maintained for a short time. Afterwards, it becomes apparent that he cannot jump as high, and his elasticity is insufficient.

Right Front Li Baocheng

Li is tall and has excellent elasticity. His signature move is a perfectly timed and skillfully placed spike when jumping. Neither too strong nor too gentle, its landing point is unpredictable. Moreover, due to its speed, the opposing team cannot defend against it. Li Baocheng was well-known for this skill in the north, and it is no wonder that his agile movements captivate fans in Shanghai. However, his serve lacks unique success, which is a minor flaw. Middle Front Mai Bingyao

The middle front's skills should focus on setting and blocking. Mai excels in both of these areas. He has a long-standing reputation in volleyball. Watching his skillful sets, one only needs a few practice sessions with him to receive the most appropriate ball. His setting skills have reached a refined state. Although Mai is not very tall, his timing when blocking is also accurate. Furthermore, Mai sometimes makes a surprise backhand flick, but his serve is not worth mentioning. In fact, he often serves the ball into the net, leaving people wondering why he cannot improve.

Left Front Chen Xuechong

Some believe that Chen Xuechong is a newcomer to volleyball, but this is not the case. It is said that when he studied in Beiping (Beijing), his interest and skills in volleyball were greater than in basketball. Chen's jumping ability is well-known to fans. Because of this, he can jump high, and his strength is sufficient. Therefore, his spikes are fast and powerful. The opposing team finds it difficult to block his high shots, and it is even harder to save them. He and Li Baocheng are the main scorers on the left and right front. Because of his jumping ability and strength, his blocking is also effective.

Right Back Zhao Yalin

Zhao is considered the only newcomer in this year's first division teams. However, in fact, Zhao's volleyball reputation in the north is well-known. While in the north, Zhao played in the front row. This time, due to team composition, he is trying the right back position, leading some to criticize the use of talent in a lower position. Unexpectedly, his first attempt revealed a powerful spike, unstoppable and fierce. This shows his mastery of volleyball. He also uses his quick mind to perform surprising saves, truly a natural talent.

Middle Back Hou Ruoyu

Those in the middle back position must be able to save and receive the ball, as well as make accurate passes. Since they have the most opportunities to get the ball due to their position, their passes must be able to supply the middle front for attacking opportunities. Hou Ruoyu has a good sense of passing the ball. However, Hou's agility in defending against enemy balls has diminished compared to the past. Perhaps due to increasing responsibilities, his diving is not as good as before. Hou sometimes makes a powerful spike, but it is often inaccurate and lacks precision. Overall, he is still a valuable player.

Left Back Yuan Bingqiu

Yuan is very thin, and some may think that he cannot make powerful spikes. However, Yuan's spikes are not only powerful but also accurate. He does not make frivolous attempts, which is commendable. In our memory, Yuan has consistently maintained his superior position in the volleyball scene, maintaining a normal state of composure and humility. Yuan has a very clear mind. Sometimes, when the opponent blocks effectively, he will make a lob over their heads. This may come from experience. Yuan and Zhao are the main scorers on the two sides of the back row.

Right Third Row Zheng Jichang

Zheng excels in boxing, so his powerful spikes are self-evident. He also has a good understanding of volleyball. In the third row, he has the quickest reach and a willingness to dive, so he can make amazing saves from seemingly impossible situations. His serve is also remarkable. Combined with his strength and experience, he can be described as a talented player in the third row.

Middle Third Row Huang Yaohua

Huang Yaohua is the most popular volleyball player in recent years. Huang's saves are not only practical but also aesthetically pleasing. When saving a difficult ball, he always lets out a loud shout. As soon as the sound comes out, the ball has already been saved in his hands. Due to these reasons, he is particularly appealing to the audience. Moreover, his serve is excellent, arguably the best in Shanghai, which is another reason for his popularity.

Left Third Row Chen Zhaobang

Chen, Zheng Jichang, and Huang Yaohua were previously on the same team, forming the most coordinated third row. Chen is the most stable of the three, but his skills are not much different from Zheng and Huang. However, he seems heavier, so he rarely dives to save the ball. His serving skills are also above average. These three players in the third row can be considered the best in Shanghai. As for Ma Canxi, Yu Xunshi, Zhuo Guorong, Li Zhenzhong, Bao Songyuan, and others, they have fewer opportunities to play due to other commitments or a willingness to give way to others. Therefore, we will have to omit them.

### Softball League: Sino-Philippine War Tomorrow - Panda Team Shows Their Skills

— Shan Miao

In this year's softball league, the Chinese Panda team was originally scheduled to have their debut match against the Samurai team on Tuesday (19th), but it was postponed due to rain and wet ground. Tomorrow (24th), Sunday morning at 10:00 AM, the Pandas will face the Philippine community team at the Tongxing Field (intersection of Route Lory and Avenue Haig in the former French Concession). Recalling last year, the Pandas, after an extremely hard-fought battle, narrowly defeated the Philippine community team by only one point. Therefore, tomorrow's match, with the two strong teams meeting again, will undoubtedly be exciting. Fans should not miss it!

Skills Are Similar

From a defensive standpoint, the two teams' skills are actually similar, especially the outfielders, who are good at catching high balls. However, the Panda team is slightly better at infield defense. In terms of shortstop, Liang Yousheng of the Chinese team sits at the gate, and any ball hit will be caught by him. Moreover, the Panda team's infielders cooperate smoothly, and they are skilled at covering and double plays. Wen Ruixiong, the third baseman, throws the ball from his wrist, and no base runner can outrun it, no matter how fast. Therefore, tomorrow, fans can enjoy the Chinese team's excellent infield skills. The Philippine team's defensive weakness lies in the second and third basemen. Their shortstop is also very mediocre, but the first baseman and catcher, Tang Qiaosilang, are quite prepared. The Chinese team should be careful when stealing bases, paying attention to Tang Qiaosilang's throws. At the same time, do not swing too early at pitcher Taishan's pitches, because his pitches are mostly soft and low. The Chinese players should be careful when swinging to avoid being tricked.

Score Will Be Very Close

The outcome of tomorrow's match will be very close. Why? Because the Chinese team's weakness is in offense, while the Philippine team's weakness is in defense. Therefore, when the Chinese team hits, they should not hit high balls. The best shots are low balls hit between the second and third basemen. Whether the Panda players can control this well is a question. According to Japanese and American baseball teams, the direction and distance of hitting are also part of the strategy. For example, in a full base situation, a high ball should be hit to the left outfield; when there is a runner on third base, a bunt should be used. Japanese and American baseball players swing their bats as they wish, observing the situation and adapting accordingly. The Chinese players' hitting has not yet reached perfection. Few can hit home runs. I have observed that the Panda team spends a lot of energy on defensive skills and neglects batting practice. I hope Mr. Liang will pay attention to this. No matter how skillful the defense is, if there is no way to attack, it is in vain. When selecting players, avoid emphasizing defensive skills and select more players who can hit the ball, so that offense and defense are balanced, and the chance of scoring is higher. I remember last year when the Portuguese Commercial team played against the Philippine community team, the Philippine team was still leading by one point until the final inning. Fortunately, the Portuguese team was good at hitting, and in the last inning, Tang Bala's home run secured the final victory. This is a good reference for the Chinese team.

Chinese Team Should Use Hitting

In short, if the Chinese team can use hitting in tomorrow's match, victory can be expected. The reason they won against the Philippine team last year was only because the Philippine first baseman dropped a catch, allowing Liang Yousheng (the only runner on base in that game) to return to home and score one point.

The Panda team's lineup for tomorrow's match:

Catcher: Wang Xiushan, Huang Yingrui. Pitcher: Li Qisheng. First base: Wang Nianzu. Second base: Wen Tianhua. Third base: Wen Ruixiong. Shortstop: Liang Yousheng. Center field: Liang Youwen. Left field: Tang Weiye. Center field: Wang Nianzi. Right field: Zhong Baoluo, Liang Youyi. It is said that the Philippine team is preparing to avenge their previous defeat. The Chinese team should do their best to defeat them.

### My Views on the Revision of the Rules of Round-Gate Ball (1)

— Di Xianzhang

Round-gate ball is a ball game created by Qian Jun Xucang. Since 1941, it has gradually become popular after a series of exhibition matches, friendly matches, and cup matches. Round-gate ball collects the advantages of basketball, football, German handball, and water polo, and develops from them. By careful consideration, taking the best and discarding the worst, it has become what it is today. The teams participating in the cup matches are not only teams organized by Chinese people, but also those from foreign countries. This proves that round-gate ball is beneficial to physical fitness. It is hoped that people in the sports world at home and abroad will promote it, so that round-gate ball matches can be held not only in China, but also in any corner of the world. This will add a lot of glory to the Chinese people in the history of sports.

In the autumn of 1941, in a round-gate ball demonstration match, Mr. Qian Buqun invited me and Mr. Yu Juefei to serve as referees. At that time, the rules used were based on Mr. Qian's personal rules. During the match, the players' skills in round-gate ball were still experimental, and there were not many highlights, but there were also no obvious flaws. After several matches, the rules were found to be inadequate, and Mr. Qian repeatedly revised the original rules in each cup match. As a result, the rules of round-gate ball gradually became perfect, which is a fortunate thing. Now, I will list and explain the items that have been added and changed, and add my own humble opinions, hoping that experts will forgive my inappropriateness.

The rules of all ball games are based on the principle of equal benefits. The rules of round-gate ball are of course no exception. In addition, the rules of any ball game have been revised and amended several or dozens of times before they are perfected.

### Number of Players

According to the original rules drafted by Mr. Qian in the first demonstration match, Chapter 5, Article 1 of the Ball Team, "Each team should have six players (one goalkeeper, one center forward, one left and one right forward, one left and one right defender)...", six players were present. However, at that time, because it was an experimental nature, the players' skills were not pure, so it was slack, and it was impossible to have an exciting performance in the game; therefore, in the second demonstration match, one center defender was added, and considerable achievements were obtained. Since then, it has been stipulated that the number of players is seven. Furthermore, the original text of Article 3 of Chapter 5 of the Ball Team: "Each team must have at least five players, and any team with less than five players shall not start the game" should also be changed to "Each team must have at least six players, and any team with less than six players shall not start the game."
