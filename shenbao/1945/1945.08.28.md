### "Befriending the Distant and Neighboring with Kin" Policy Achieves Preliminary Success; Premier Sun Discusses Sino-Soviet Treaty

Central News Agency, Chongqing, 27th – After the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance was approved by the Legislative Yuan, a Central News Agency reporter visited Premier Sun Ke, but due to the limited time, a thorough discussion was not possible. The reporter then visited him again on the 26th. Sun first stated: "The signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance can be regarded as an epoch-making initiative in Sino-Soviet diplomacy." Sun then described to the reporter the diplomatic relations between China and the Soviet Union over the past twenty-two years, stating,

Guaranteeing Far East Peace

"The greatest significance of this treaty is that it guarantees peace in the Far East and prevents Japan from launching aggression again within thirty years. This regional security system, under the umbrella of the United Nations, provides an additional layer of protection for peace in the Far East. During this period of peace, we will lay the foundation for national construction and create a truly strong country, so that peace in the Far East can last forever." The reporter inquired about the impact of the treaty on domestic unity. Sun replied with a pleasant tone, "This treaty has a great impact on promoting the unification of our country."

Promoting Unity and Establishing a Buffer Zone

"I believe that the issue of domestic unity will take a sharp turn for the better. The treaty clearly stipulates that the Soviet Union's aid to us, both morally and materially, will only be related to the National Government recognized by all our allies, meaning that it will not be related to local governments or other regimes not recognized by the central government, and will never interfere in our internal affairs. As for the Outer Mongolia issue, our country recognizes its independence, which is necessary both in fact and in the spirit of Sun Yat-sen's Three Principles of the People. Outer Mongolia's independent status has been a reality for twenty-five years, and the lives of its people are improving daily. Our country should recognize this and establish normal diplomatic relations. This buffer zone benefits both China and the Soviet Union. As for the provisions regarding the China Eastern Railway and Lushun, they are also based on the alliance relationship, allowing the Soviet Union and China to jointly keep watch over Japan to prevent it from rising again and permanently securing peace in the Far East. This is indeed necessary. In short, the most affected by the signing of the Sino-Soviet treaty is Japan. Peace in the Far East can now be guaranteed, and the foundation for national construction can be laid. It can be said that this is a preliminary success of our foreign policy of 'befriending the distant and neighboring with kin'."

Minister Zhang Zhizhong Expresses His Thoughts

Central News Agency, Chongqing, 27th – After the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance was approved by the Supreme National Defense Council, a Central News Agency reporter paid a special visit to Minister of the Political Department Zhang Zhizhong to ask for his thoughts. Minister Zhang spoke with excitement and pleasure, saying: "The Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance marks the beginning of a new stage in Sino-Soviet diplomatic relations and is a guarantee for stabilizing the Far East and maintaining world peace. For China, we have won the victory in the eight-year war against Japan, and by concluding a treaty of friendship and alliance with the Soviet Union, we have also won peace. China, through this long and arduous war of resistance against Japan, deeply understands that consolidating the international order of peace is the foundation for completing China's national construction. The establishment of friendly relations between China and the Soviet Union not only enables China's national construction work to proceed smoothly but also provides a solid guarantee for peace in the Far East and international cooperation. This is not only welcomed by China and the Soviet Union but also by peace-loving countries around the world. I sincerely hope that the people of our country will cherish the international status we have gained through eight years of war against Japan, cherish the precious friendship between our country and the Allied countries, and cherish the favorable environment for peaceful construction that we have gained through the conclusion of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance. Let us work together with one heart and one mind under the leadership of Chairman Chiang, starting from now, to prepare to work hard for thirty years for national construction. I firmly believe that we will be able to gradually complete the construction of a new China based on the Three Principles of the People and create a glorious new page in the great history of the Chinese nation."

### Triumphal Song Publicly Soliciting Musical Scores

Educator Shen Xingong, a pioneer in using Western music to write songs in China, recently composed a Triumphal Song at the request of the expeditionary Indian (missing character) intelligent youth army. To be solemn, he is publicly soliciting musical scores. There is no shortage of famous composers in Shanghai. It is hoped that they will actively submit their contributions (the musical scores should pay attention to grandeur and liveliness) to the Shanghai Office of the Central Propaganda Department, 1105 Taishan Road, or the Central Organization Department Translator's Office, 149 Yuangmingyuan Road. After selection, it will be submitted to the authorities for approval and officially promulgated so that it can be sung during the celebration of victory. The lyrics are as follows:

Triumphal Song

First Verse

Joy! Joy! Joy! Sing the Triumphal Song and return home,

See parents, elders, sisters, and brothers again,

Fighting for eight years and traveling ten thousand miles, following the leader and persisting to the end,

Mostly because we are unwilling to let power trample on justice,

Brothers risked their lives, compatriots shed blood and tears,

Seizing the final victory and laying the foundation for a strong nation.

Long live the Republic of China! Long live, long, long live!

Long live the Republic of China! Long live, long, long live!

Second Verse

Rise! Rise! Rise! Reconstruction and development are not easy,

May all our compatriots encourage each other from now on,

Be selfless and uphold justice, put the country first, and work together in harmony,

Build our country into a modern democratic polity,

Enable our compatriots to live and work in peace and contentment, seek freedom and equality for mankind,

And jointly maintain lasting peace throughout the world with the Allied countries.

Long live the Republic of China! Long live, long, long live!

Long live the Republic of China! Long live, long, long live!

### Destroying the Home for the Revolution, An Interview with Deputy Secretary-General Peng

— Fang Cheng

Historically, there have been many stories of "destroying the home (to) avert disaster" and many heroic deeds of "abandoning the pen to join the army." From a conservative point of view, it seems that these stories are all made by (missing character) . In fact, the motivation of the parties involved stems from the enthusiasm to forget the family for the sake of the country and to sacrifice oneself for righteousness, without the slightest bit of luck or opportunism. And the reason why our nation's lifeline can be continued and justice can be (missing character) is precisely because of the (missing character) on this group of " (missing character) ".

The Grandson of Peng Gongbao

In the list of senior personnel of the Shanghai Action Corps Headquarters, besides Secretary Cheng and Zhang, who felt very unfamiliar, there was also a Mr. Peng Tao. It is said that Mr. Peng is from Hunan. He is the grandson of Peng (missing character), and graduated from the University of Hong Kong. In terms of family background, he is a descendant of a scholarly family, and also the son of a general. In terms of education, the University of Hong Kong is a famous university in the Far East, and the (missing character) of the University of Hong Kong was once yearned for by most young people. With such a family background and education, it is enough for ordinary people to be proud and enjoy the happiness of a playboy. However, Mr. Peng did not care about these vanities, but was determined to participate in the revolutionary movement, to the point of destroying his family and going bankrupt for the revolution, and experiencing the tragic life of the world for the revolution. During my last interview with Mr. Cheng Kexiang, Secretary-General of the Shanghai Action Corps, I learned snippets of the brief history of his comrade, Mr. Peng Shou, Deputy Secretary-General and Director of the Propaganda Department. To know more details, I made a special visit.

Destroying the Home to Join the Revolution

At the western end of the long and (missing character) Feilu Road, reaching the office location of the Propaganda Department, I immediately met Mr. Peng. My first impression of him was humility and elegance. After sitting down, I first raised the question about Mr. Peng's past struggles. He pondered for a moment and said with a smile, "Isn't this just a dangerous dream? After graduating from university, I felt deeply that the warlords were dividing the country and the national situation was on the verge of danger. I was determined to participate in the revolution. Although my family tried to persuade me in many ways, I didn't care at all. Later, I crossed the oceans twice to study in the United States, and after returning to China, I continued to participate in the revolutionary work." This shows that Mr. Peng also had the heroic deeds of "abandoning the pen to join the army" and "destroying the home (to) avert disaster."

"When the Northeast Incident occurred in 1918, my blood boiled even more. With the approval of the relevant authorities, I worked secretly in the Northeast as a common citizen for a long time, and presented the results of my work to the relevant authorities. At the beginning of the August 13th Shanghai Incident, I first penetrated deep behind enemy lines and worked on the enemy's front lines, living every day in a hail of bullets, artillery fire, and airplanes. For my aspirations, I forgot all the dangers. Later, when Shanghai fell and the National Army withdrew westward, I had no choice but to go to work in Guangzhou. When Guangzhou fell, I returned to Shanghai, and then (missing character) went to work in Wuhan."

"In the 29th year of the Republic (1940), I came to Shanghai again and still often traveled between Nanjing and Shanghai as a people's revolutionary. Later, I tasted the flavor of iron windows, but my determination to fight became stronger. I made persistent efforts until today. However, my old homes in Hengyang, Changsha, and Hangzhou have all been razed to the ground, leaving only half of the ancestral temple left by my ancestors." Mr. Peng recounted his tragic history in one breath. I was very moved after listening and expressed my great respect. I then raised my opinion on joining the Shanghai Action Corps this time. He said:

"During this transitional period when Japan has accepted the Potsdam Declaration and the National Government is preparing to take over, but the National Army has not yet arrived, we certainly have the responsibility to maintain the security of Shanghai as a whole and the entire social order. However, all Shanghai citizens should recognize its importance and understand its responsibilities at the same time. My comrades and I have long been dedicated to our aspirations. As long as it conforms to our aspirations, we will not refuse even to go through fire and water, let alone other sacrifices. Moreover, my comrades and I are participating in this work as people who have been selected, and we have no political relationship."

Full of Mystery

At this point in the conversation, the waiter reported that a guest had arrived, so I bid farewell. On my way back, a question mark appeared in my mind: "He and his comrades are participating in this work as people, but he is wearing a general's military uniform, and it is also the style of the central army? Maybe he is particularly modest! From the look of his words and actions, he seems to be a person who has undergone rigorous training. Mr. Peng is really mysterious!

### Yesterday's Market Conditions

Yesterday, gold jewelry was listed at 5 million yuan per tael. Inside and outside the industry, the price at noon was 47 million yuan. Foreign currency: US notes, 100,000 yuan; Hong Kong notes, 3,000 yuan, or 6,000 yuan; old currency, 130 yuan; customs gold, 2,550 yuan. The interest rate for interbank lending by the Money Traders Association was 0.3 yuan. Silver was 35,000 yuan, and silver dollars were 21,000 yuan. Off-exchange trading of Chinese stocks gradually became prosperous, so the downward trend of stocks slightly stabilized. Various parties had a slight intention to absorb, resulting in stable confidence and firming transaction prices. The unified public price market was mixed with firmness and weakness. The supply of rice to the market was not scarce, and the demand was average, resulting in stable prices. The market for daily necessities remained stable, and the market for cigarettes rebounded.

### I Hope So

— Cheng

The Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance has been signed, which clearly stipulates that the Soviet Union's assistance to us, both morally and practically, is related to the National Government recognized by all our allies. In other words, it does not have any relationship with local governments or other regimes not recognized by the central government, and it will absolutely not interfere in our domestic affairs.

US Ambassador Hurley left Chongqing on the 27th for Yan'an, with the consent of Chairman Chiang, intending to accompany Mao Zedong to Chongqing to discuss with Chairman Chiang. Therefore, the domestic unity issue, which is attracting the attention of the people of the country, may have a sharp and downward turn for the better. This is good news among good news.

Mr. Zhang Zhizhong said, "For China, the Sino-Soviet alliance means that we have won the victory in the eight-year war of resistance against Japan. By concluding a treaty of friendship and alliance with the Soviet Union, we have won peace again." We, the people of the country, hope so.

### "Vagrant" for Two Years (Part 1)

— Yan Fu

I remember very well that July 17th of the year before last was the first day I stepped into the Shanghai Vagrant Training Center. Two days before, I was caught by a Russian patrolman from the ×× Police Station on ××× Road. Because the clothes I was wearing were so (missing character), it was simply un(missing character) people. Being caught into the vagrant center was something I expected!

"Do you have a citizen's certificate?" "Um...!" "Whack!" The whip came down!

In this way, I became a prisoner. My arms were netted and I was taken around the street for a big circle. When I reached the police station, a total of six people had been caught with me.

The Russian policeman took us to his superior and said very respectfully, "I Catch Dix Men. Sir." He had captured six wild (missing character), like a meritorious deed!

We were locked up in a prison cell. After a while, around 9 p.m., a prison guard brought a bucket of clean water into the cell, shouting at us to wash our hands clean. We were going to the court to take fingerprints and make statements right away.

"What do you do? Where have you stolen things? Confess quickly!"

"............"

All ten fingers were blackened with ink and pressed on white paper. I was a little dazed, like a dream.

I know very well that I am the most unmotivated person. I can't even solve the minimum living needs for myself. No wonder I ended up in this situation. Even so, I have never complained about myself or condemned myself, because I have never done anything against my conscience.

In less than two days, the prison cell was full of sixty or seventy people. This pile was all rotten stuff, dregs, the things people hate most, a (missing character) dying on the road to ruin.

On the morning of the 17th, under the supervision of masked officials, doctors, nurses, and bailiffs, we boarded a canvas-covered truck and drove away.

The truck was bumping (missing character) forward. Because of the canvas cover, the scenery on the street could not be seen. It was even more impossible to escape. The weather was (missing character) gloomy and very windy, like sighing at the frustration of life.

The truck stopped, and that was the Shanghai Vagrant Training Center. A white wall surrounds a square city, like the ruins of ancient Rome.

After being examined by a doctor, having our heads shaved, taking a bath, and registering at the center, I was an out-and-out vagrant. From then on, I lived in the vagrant center.

The hand of a giant (missing character) arranged for me to go from the free world to a land of isolation, only listening to the autumn (missing character) chirping every night, telling how boring life is.

Soon, I learned that this place used to be called the "Shanghai Tramp Training Center," founded by the (missing character) Wang Yiting. It had been suspended after the incident, and now it was run by the World Red Cross, which changed the name to "Shanghai Vagrant Training Center." It changed the former "tramp" to "vagrant." It is said that changing this one is of great significance. Once a chairman of the Red Cross came to the center to (missing character) speak and explained the meaning of changing the word "tramp" to "vagrant." He said: "Changing the word 'tramp' to 'vagrant' has a profound meaning. Generally speaking, it can improve your reputation and status. Because 'tramp' and 'vagrant' are fundamentally different. 'Tramp' refers to unemployed vagrants, people who are idle and wander around, greedy for food and lazy. Therefore, vagrants have some inferior and bad representations; but 'vagrants' are different. Vagrants are homeless people, or those who are forced to live a vagrant life because of the current environment. It is not because of their own inferiority that they (missing character) fall; therefore, they are different from the greedy and lazy 'tramps.' Also, the word 'tramp' has no definite goal. Tramping around, they can trample everywhere. This is a chaotic and disordered phenomenon. The word 'vagrant' is the opposite. For example, flowing water only flows downwards or upwards. These are all with a goal. Having a goal makes it easier to improve. For example, vagrants are all tending downwards. Now we have to find ways to improve them. Isn't this better organized and has a better goal than tramps?"

### Welcoming Victory

— Niansheng

The cheers of victory ended the suffocating nightmare of the past eight years. We (missing character) wake up from darkness and pain, embracing full of passion and joy, welcoming light! New life!

Victory has opened a new page in history, and the arduous and heavy task is the unfinished journey. The days of ease and comfort are still far away! We still have to shed more blood and sweat!
