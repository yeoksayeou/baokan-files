Railway Thieves Will Be Punished According to Law

Nanjing, 23rd (Central News Agency) – In order to consolidate wartime transportation in the rear and ensure the safety of cargo and luggage, the Ministry of Construction believes that theft of railway equipment, passenger luggage, and other goods should be subject to special punishment depending on the circumstances, given the importance of wartime transportation. If railway employees commit the above-mentioned acts, the original sentence will be increased by up to one-half. The ministry has jointly drafted the temporary regulations for wartime punishment of theft of railway equipment and transport items with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, which were submitted to the Executive Yuan and passed at the 241st meeting according to the review opinions, and submitted to the Supreme National Defense Council for approval. It will be implemented as soon as the deliberation is completed.

### Four Enemy Planes Attacked Nanjing, Two Were Shot Down

Nanjing, 23rd (Central News Agency) – American P51 type aircraft stationed in Chongqing, totaling four, intruded into the airspace over the Nanjing area twice on the 23rd, in the morning and afternoon. They were intercepted by the Japanese Air Force in aerial combat, and two of them were shot down. Thanks to the activity of the air defense forces, the enemy planes gained nothing and fled.

### Japanese Planes Night-Raided Zhijiang Airport

Continental Front Base, 23rd (Central News Agency) – On the night of the 21st, a Japanese elite bomber squadron attacked the enemy airfield in Zhijiang, Hunan Province, and bombs hit two small planes on the ground, which caught fire and burned. There were also two major explosions. The entire Japanese squadron returned safely to base.

### Five American Experts Left Chongqing to Return to Their Country

Guangzhou, 23rd (Central News Agency) – According to a Chongqing broadcast on the 21st, five American technical experts from the Chongqing Wartime Production Bureau suddenly resigned and returned to their country. The establishment of the Production Bureau was based on the advice of the United States. The high expectations for these technical experts when they first joined the Bureau were not difficult to imagine. Now, they have retreated halfway, indicating the extent to which they could not cooperate with the staff in Chongqing. Therefore, there will inevitably be various disputes in the Wartime Production Bureau in the future.

### The Morale of the Japanese Rear Is Extremely High: Ambassador Tani's Talk with Reporters

Japanese Ambassador to China, Mr. Tani Masazane, met with a group of reporters in Shanghai at 11:00 AM yesterday (the 23rd), explaining the policies towards China that were decided upon during his recent return to Japan, and strongly stated that the morale of the Japanese people in the rear is extremely high. He finally hoped that the Japanese people in China would unite and rise up. The content of the talk is recorded as follows:

Sufficient Strength to Promote the War

During my return to Tokyo this time, I was most deeply impressed by the increasingly high morale of the people in the rear and the fact that Japan still has sufficient strength to advance the war. Enemy planes are bombing the Japanese mainland, and robberies are frequent. The rear has long become the front, but they are used to it. As soon as they see enemy planes, they feel that the war is close to their side. Officials and civilians cooperate with each other, and today it has developed into a comrades-in-arms bond. Therefore, regardless of enemy air raids, increased production is not hindered in the slightest, so that the mobilization of domestic resources still leaves a considerable degree of strength. From this point, it can be recognized that Japan still has sufficient ability to conduct operations in the future. The enemy is disregarding bloodshed and forcibly carrying out landing operations, attempting to destroy Japan's war-making capabilities, but their purpose is feared to be difficult to achieve.

Implementing Economic Measures for China

The economic measures for China decided in Tokyo this time are not innovative, but merely to quickly implement what has not been implemented in the past, in order to adapt to the needs of the war situation. The main content is the integrated operation of local agencies in a three-in-one manner, and strengthening the rapid connection with Tokyo.

The Director-General of General Affairs of the Greater East Asia Ministry, Ando, came to China the other day and held a meeting of embassy and office directors in Nanjing to discuss issues related to prices, currency, production, and transportation. In short, the sole objective is to rapidly promote the local war effort. Director-General Ando has a deep understanding of the local economic situation, and it is expected that he will be able to achieve the intended purpose of the economic measures in the future.

Regarding Maintaining the Value of Savings Certificates

Regarding maintaining the value of the currency, there are two kinds of countermeasures, active and passive. The former includes increasing production, withdrawing currency, and issuing securities, while the latter includes emergency measures such as the price countermeasures implemented this time. However, in order to maintain the value of savings certificates, the ratio of 18 yen to 100 yuan of savings certificates has always been firmly adhered to, and concrete countermeasures are being gradually promoted at the same time.

### Japanese Submarine Sinks Enemy Cruiser in Philippine Waters

Tokyo, 22nd (Central News Agency) – A Japanese submarine, which has been demonstrating its fierce power in the vicinity of the Philippines, sank a large enemy cruiser in the Mindoro Sea on the 21st. At 10:30 AM that morning, a submarine commanded by Chief Petty Officer Matsuda discovered a fleet composed of two large enemy cruisers, several cruisers, and dozens of destroyers and transport ships sailing in the Mindoro Sea. It immediately charged in. At approximately 11:30 AM, a Japanese torpedo hit a large enemy 10,000-ton class cruiser. The enemy ship's forward magazine exploded in flames, and before long, the entire ship sank.

### The Central Government Emphasizes Streamlining Administration and Formulates Various Measures to Simplify Procedures such as Changing Organizations

Nanjing, 23rd (Central News Agency) – In order to adapt to wartime needs and emphasize methods of simplifying government administration, the central authorities have approved two principles at the 64th National Defense Council meeting. First, in the future, the procedures for changing the organization of various central government organs and their subordinate organs, such as determining principles and amending articles (including abolitions, mergers, and new establishments), should be streamlined. Second, in the future, when various ministries, commissions, and departments of the Executive Yuan increase fees, fines, and penalties for matters under their jurisdiction in order to meet needs and simplify procedures, they should first submit the principles for increasing fees to the Executive Yuan meeting for discussion and then submit them to the Central Political Committee for approval. As for relevant laws and regulations, the relevant ministries, commissions, and departments should amend them based on the approved principles and then submit them to the Executive Yuan for approval or record without submitting them to a meeting or forwarding them to the Central Political Committee. However, those that should be sent to the Legislative Yuan for deliberation should still be handled by the Executive Yuan as usual. Regarding the first item, four specific measures are proposed as follows:

Four Measures for Changing Organizations

(1) When the organization of various Yuan and directly subordinate organs of the National Government is to be changed, the principles should first be submitted to the Central Political Committee for approval. The laws and regulations related to the organization should be amended by the organ based on the approved principles and then submitted to the Central Political Committee for transmittal to the Legislative Yuan for deliberation without being submitted to a meeting of the Central Political Committee. (2) When the organization of various ministries and departments of the Executive Yuan is to be changed, the principles should be deliberated together with the amended organization law at a meeting of the Executive Yuan, and the principles should be submitted to the Central Political Committee for approval. The amended organization law should be directly transmitted by the Executive Yuan to the Legislative Yuan for deliberation without being submitted to the Central Political Committee. (3) When the organization of subordinate organs of various departments of the Executive Yuan is to be changed, the principles should first be submitted to a meeting of the Executive Yuan for discussion by the various departments, and the principles should be submitted by the Executive Yuan to the Central Political Committee for record. The laws and regulations related to the organization should be amended or drafted by the responsible departments based on the approved principles and then submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval without being submitted to a meeting of the Executive Yuan. However, those related to two or more departments should still convene a meeting of representatives from the relevant departments and commissions for review. If the laws and regulations require deliberation by the Legislative Yuan, they should be transmitted to the Legislative Yuan for deliberation. (4) When the organization of military organs is to be changed, the Military Affairs Commission should refer to the second and third measures. However, if the laws and regulations that should be submitted to the Legislative Yuan for deliberation are not submitted to the Legislative Yuan due to military secrecy, they should still be submitted to the National Defense Council.

### Turkish Foreign Minister Invited to Visit London

Stockholm, 23rd (Central News Agency) – The Turkish Foreign Minister has decided to visit London recently at the invitation of the British government. In addition, the US government will establish a policy of political and economic cooperation with the Turkish government before the San Francisco Conference.

Geneva, 23rd (Central News Agency) – The German News Agency, London message: Officials announced that French Foreign Minister Bidault accepted the British government's invitation on Thursday to visit London. This trip will provide an opportunity to clarify France's position related to Rand, develop and promote plans to increase economic assistance to France, and seek to agree on a number of strategies for the issue of British and French interests in the Levant.

### French Ambassador Gaudelu Arrives in Moscow to Assume Office

Stockholm, 23rd (Central News Agency) – The German News Agency message: A Reuters Moscow message said that the French Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Gaudelu, arrived in Moscow by plane on Thursday.

### Churchill Explains the Atlantic Charter

Answering questions from members of parliament

Stockholm, 23rd (Central News Agency) – The German News Agency, London message: Prime Minister Churchill answered in the House of Commons yesterday regarding whether the Polish-Baltic agreement violates Article 2 of the Atlantic Charter, specifically stating that the Atlantic Charter is an instruction and not a rule. During the question time, Mr. Churchill firmly refused to discuss the situation of the Crimean Conference.

### The US Secretary of State Issues a Warning

Strictly Prevent Nazi Activities

Lisbon, 23rd (Central News Agency) – Havas Agency message, Reuters message: US Secretary of State Stettinius said at the Pan-American Conference that Nazi and Fascist secret elements may still invade the Western Hemisphere to prepare for a return to the Americas in the economic and political aspects, so they should still be paid attention to.

### The Turkish Parliament Meets to Listen to the Report on the Situation

Lisbon, 23rd (Central News Agency) – Havas Agency message: A Turkish radio station said that the Turkish National Assembly was convened by Speaker Emda today to hold a plenary session. At that time, the government will report on the general situation.

Stockholm, 23rd (Central News Agency) – Havas Agency message: Helsinki message, Finnish Foreign Minister Engell and Svente reported to the Congressional Foreign Affairs Committee yesterday on the diplomatic and political situation. The Committee believed that the government's recent reports were unsatisfactory. As for the content of the two foreign ministers' reports this time, it is still impossible to know.

### Guo Pei Writes an Article on the European Crisis: Germany Resolves to Fight to Complete Its Historical Mission

Berlin, 23rd (Central News Agency) – The German News Agency message, Dr. Goebbels published an article in the German weekly, the main points of which are as follows: Although Stalin did not think about publicly announcing his plan in the past, his 200 million slaves are now working hard to realize his plan. Stalin dreams that the future world will be under the dictatorial rule of the Moscow International. Although there has been an agreement between Roosevelt and Churchill, if the Germans lay down their weapons, the Soviet Union will occupy all of Eastern and Southeastern Europe and most of Germany. Then, even if this vast area is isolated, it will engage in large-scale massacres of its people. The Jewish newspapers in London and New York may praise it. In the future, Britain will be less able to carry out European and world policies that represent its own interests. In 1948, President Roosevelt will be defeated in the election, and the Republican isolationists will be elected as president. Their first move will probably be to withdraw American troops from Europe. This move will be praised by the entire American people. In this war, Britain has been forced to abandon its 200-year-old balance of power policy and recognize a world power in Europe. This power will never stop until it includes Britain in its dictatorial scope. Four weeks before the outbreak of this war, the German leader proposed adjusting British-German foreign policy. Germany should respect Britain's sea power, Britain should respect Germany's land power, and air power should be equal. The two countries should jointly guarantee world peace. If this were the case, communism would not spread. Now communism has come to the Varta River. Whether it can be stopped depends entirely on the resistance of the German army. This is the situation of the war. The communique of the Yalta Conference has failed to change it. All we have is our strength and ideals. We will never give them up. This is a prerequisite for our survival and the completion of our historical mission.

### Minister Matsushima Explains the Battle of Iwo Jima: The Enemy American Forces Suffered Heavy Losses

The Allied Japanese Fleet News Department held a regular briefing yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM. Minister Matsushima, Lieutenant Matsumoto, and trustees Toshio Hayashi, Saka Tsume, Wang Bingnan, and Liu Zhennan, as well as reporters from various newspapers, attended. Minister Matsushima gave a speech, explaining in detail the Battle of Iwo Jima and the losses of the enemy Americans in the Pacific. The main points are as follows:

Japanese Forces on Iwo Jima Strongly Intercept the Enemy

On February 16th and 17th, powerful American mobile units appeared in the sea south of Tokyo. Their air units bombed the Japanese airfields south of Kanto. At the same time, they carried out the Battle of Iwo Jima. The total number of enemy planes during the air raids was 1,000 on the 16th and more than 500 on the 17th. The Japanese side had prepared for the enemy's bombing in advance. Under the air force interception, more than 300 enemy planes were shot down, and the Japanese side suffered very little damage. The American fleet was commanded by Spruance. It consisted of a large number of battle cruisers and aircraft carriers, and it mobilized a large air force from the Mariana Islands. However, the war results obtained by the enemy were very small. When the enemy attacked Iwo Jima, they used a powerful fleet to cover the landing of their Fourth and Fifth Army Corps. They encountered strong interception from the Japanese side. Their hard battle was unprecedented in this war. The number of American landing troops was approximately 30,000. As of the 21st, the losses were already over 10,000 people and 25 or 26 ships. The magnitude of the enemy's losses can be imagined, while the Japanese army has always firmly defended its main positions. By the 22nd, the enemy's personnel losses had reached 12,000 people. In order to replenish its forces, it landed another division. In an area of only 300 yards, the enemy fought hard and suffered great losses, and their morale was greatly demoralized. Their commander ordered "anyone who flees from the battle will be executed immediately." The Japanese army calmly responded to the battle, using the air force and land forces to cooperate in the attack.

Landing Enemy Forces Suffer Heavy Losses

After the enemy Americans began landing at the southern end of Iwo Jima, they divided their forces into two groups to attack. One group attacked the central area, and the other group attacked Mount Suribachi to the west. However, their progress was only two hundred yards. On the sea, they used submarines to attack the enemy, so the enemy Americans suffered unprecedented heavy losses. According to statistics, the damage is as follows: As of the 21st, the enemy Americans suffered 12,000 personnel losses on land and 8,500 personnel losses at sea, averaging 5,000 personnel losses per day on land and 200 personnel losses per hour. The area of Iwo Jima is 32 square kilometers, and the enemy occupied 10 kilometers. Their loss for every kilometer occupied was 1,200 people. Therefore, the degree of damage to the enemy in this battle was even greater than in the past battles of Gilbert, Makin, and Tarawa. The air force that attacked Tokyo, after completing the air raid, still flew back to the sea east of Iwo Jima to replenish supplies. However, due to the excessive damage to its mobile units, it could not replenish them and reduced its activity.

Japanese Forces in the Philippines Carry Out a Surprise Attack

In the Philippines, the enemy Americans, with the 37th Division and the 1st Cavalry Division, jointly attacked Manila. After the 14th, the Japanese army launched a surprise attack from the northern part of Manila. By the 17th, they had suppressed the enemy's main forces at the Barmagan and Quezon airfields and rushed into the city of Manila, making contact with the local Japanese army and navy. This move was completely unexpected by the enemy Americans, and the American army fell into a state of confusion. Therefore, the defense of Manila has now been reversed, and the enemy Americans are gradually in a position to be annihilated. Therefore, the American side has been quite silent about the war in the Philippines recently, which is generally considered strange. It is because they suffered a major blow from this surprise attack that they were unable to say anything.

Enemy Propaganda Has a Different Purpose

At present, the Japanese army in the Pacific is at the stage of launching a major offensive. We are grateful for the courageous and hard fighting of the soldiers on the front lines, and we are especially grateful for the various cooperation in China to complete this Greater East Asia War. Now, the ability of the enemy Americans to fight has reached its highest point. Their Secretary of War Stimson recently said: If the United States cannot replenish the front-line forces in a rapid and appropriate manner, then there is no way to fight the war. Its urgency can be seen. Also, in the midst of this tense war situation, the enemy has repeatedly propagated that the Japanese army has massacred Filipinos and Javanese in the Philippines and New Guinea. In fact, these are all false propagandas. The purpose of their propaganda is nothing more than to arouse the people's resistance to Japan and to create an excuse for killing people when landing on the Chinese mainland or the Japanese mainland in the future. In the past, some people in China predicted that Japan would inevitably fail in the Greater East Asia War. This kind of concept should be corrected urgently.

Unfounded Rumors Are Completely Untenable

Yesterday, a friend came to Shanghai from Tokyo and talked about the past rumors that the Omura area of Kyushu, Japan (near Sasebo), had been repeatedly bombed by enemy B29 type aircraft and had been razed to the ground, and that the streets were difficult to distinguish. Some Japanese people also believed in this kind of rumor. Now, according to what they have seen, it is completely untrue. As for the so-called aircraft bombing, no one knows where the bombs fell, and there has not been any change in the local area. It can be seen that rumors are not credible. Also, the enemy Americans used as many as 600 warships and boats to attack Iwo Jima recently, but from the 19th when they landed to the 21st, the progress was only 200 yards. In the past, some people in Shanghai overestimated the strength of the enemy Americans, which is completely wrong and should be urgently corrected.

The German Military and Civilians Will Fight to the End

Regarding the European war situation, the German army is fully demonstrating its intention to counterattack the Soviet army, which has advanced to the vicinity of Berlin. There are fierce counterattack battles in Königsberg, Stettin, Frankfurt, and its south. The Western Front is also conducting a strong counterattack against the British and American forces. The German military and civilians are embracing the spirit of fighting to the end and fully demonstrating their combat capabilities. If China and Japan can cooperate to the end, it will be easy to defeat the British and Americans and protect East Asia.

Editorial

### On the Dispersal of Industry

Modern warfare is total war. Whether at the front lines or behind them, whether producers or transporters, all are part of the entire war system. Therefore, destroying the enemy's production facilities and hindering their transportation are crucial steps in combat. Currently, the Greater East Asia War has reached a decisive stage. Enemy air raids are inevitable, and Shanghai is an important base in the rear. Thus, Shanghai's industry and surrounding transportation are likely to be targets of enemy air raids. This is the first thing that should be noted.

Dispersal efforts are being planned and implemented. Relying solely on persuasion cannot overcome the inertia of the general public. In the future, forced dispersal may be implemented when necessary, but this is not a thorough solution. Analyzing the reasons why the general public remains in Shanghai, the majority do so because of their jobs, believing it difficult to live if they leave Shanghai. Therefore, resolving the issue of employment after dispersal is the second thing that should be noted.

In the future, transportation will become increasingly difficult. As a result, the exchange of agricultural products needed for Shanghai citizens' daily lives and Shanghai industrial products needed by the countryside will also become increasingly difficult, greatly impacting the daily lives of people in both urban and rural areas. This is the third thing that should be noted.

To resolve these three issues, we believe that dispersing Shanghai's industry is a worthwhile consideration. We offer these humble opinions in the hope of attracting the attention of the city's industrial sector and providing a reference for the Chinese and Japanese authorities.

Considering the perspective of factories, there are four difficulties in implementing dispersal:

First is the power issue. Currently, most factories in the city rely on electricity as their power source, with very few owning their own generators. Once dispersed, small towns certainly do not have sufficient facilities to supply electricity to factories. Even if they wanted to install their own engines, there would be many difficulties in terms of capital and technology.

Second is the factory building issue. Currently, finding housing in the interior is not easy. Even if suitable factory buildings and sites can be found, issues such as obtaining factory establishment permits from local governments are also very troublesome.

Third is the transportation issue. Factory machinery is large and heavy, not as easy to move as ordinary people's luggage. However, technical difficulties are relatively easy to solve. As far as I know, when a group of newly opened factories in Taicang and Changshu transported machinery from Shanghai, the difficulties encountered during transportation, from obtaining transport permits to the extortion along the way, were beyond the imagination of the average person.

Fourth is the funding issue. Although factories would rather endure temporary relocation losses, the working capital required during the relocation process is also quite substantial. With current financial tightening, not to mention official assistance, borrowing this sum from the financial sector is also quite difficult.

Industrial dispersal is indeed an extremely arduous task, but it is not an unsolvable problem. Currently, production enterprises should not be viewed simply as profit-making organizations but as part of the war machine. All participating countries in this war have listed industrial dispersal as an important national policy. Regardless of how difficult the work or how large the expenditure, factories are willing to endure, and governments provide full assistance. Therefore, if a firm decision can be made regarding the dispersal of Shanghai's industry and political support is obtained at the same time, then even if various difficulties arise due to dispersal, they can be reduced to a minimum.

Secondly, the electricity supply for factories in this city is severely restricted. Therefore, factories that rely on electricity, which are the majority of small and medium-sized enterprises in Shanghai, may face reduced production or shutdowns at any time (many are already shut down). Rather than lingering on in the present, it is better to look to the future, endure the current inconvenience and losses, and seize this opportunity to lay a permanent foundation for the future. It is hoped that industrial circles will voluntarily form groups of related factories. For example, Industry A and Industry B are often interconnected, and primary processing and reprocessing factories cannot exist separately. When relocating to safer areas, a group of factories can jointly install a power generation device, which not only reduces costs due to shared expenses but also makes it easier to solve technical difficulties due to greater financial resources. In this way, the power issue will not arise.

The city's Dispersal Committee should establish a separate department, such as a Factory Relocation Committee. This committee must include relevant military and government agencies, such as the Economic Bureau, Security Command, Blockade Management Office, Water Police, and the county governments of the dispersal destinations. It must also include the financial industry, mainly the Central Reserve Bank, as well as industrial experts. Then, jointly research and develop a sound implementation plan, designating the factories to be dispersed and the relocation locations. The locations must be dispersed and not concentrated, must be in rural areas and avoid cities, must be convenient for transportation, and must be able to use natural forests for air raid shelters. Then, the group of factories will relocate to the designated location, with the committee supporting the acquisition of relocation and factory establishment permits, the bank providing loans, the military escorting the transport, and industrial experts guiding and solving technical difficulties. In this way, several important issues—transportation, funding, technology, and politics—can be easily resolved.

In the past, the large boilers of the Longzhang Paper Mill and the Liuhegou Iron Factory were able to safely pass through the Three Gorges, thousands of miles away, under extremely difficult circumstances. Then, are Shanghai's small and medium-sized factories unable to disperse to the countryside, which can be reached in a day? After dispersal, from the factory's perspective, some raw materials and fuels can be obtained locally, labor and food costs can be relatively low, and the risk of air raids can be reduced. From the government's perspective, which participating country's government does not assist industry in increasing production? Does not break up industry into smaller units? Government support for industrial dispersal is an undeniable duty. From the Dispersal Committee's perspective, Shanghai is a commercial and industrial city, and industrial and commercial employees and their families account for the largest part of the population. In today's situation where foreign trade has been suspended, commerce almost relies on the city's industry. Once industrial dispersal is realized, at least industrial employees and their families will inevitably relocate along with it, and the purpose of dispersal will naturally be easier to achieve.

The dispersal of industry is of great importance, not only during wartime but also during peacetime. It is hoped that the authorities responsible for dispersal can give it special and careful consideration.

### Divine Wind Corps of Japan Fiercely Attacks, Sinking Seven Enemy Warships; Pillars of Fire Discovered Off Iwo Jima

Tokyo, 23rd (Central News Agency): The Special Attack Force of the Divine Wind Corps of the Japanese Air Force attacked enemy mobile units around Iwo Jima on the afternoon of the 21st, sinking or destroying two enemy aircraft carriers and five enemy warships. According to observation reports from the highlands of Iwo Jima, at 5:55 PM on the 21st, a large fire suddenly broke out among the enemy fleet in the waters east of the island, visible from the high ground. At 6:00 PM, it was further confirmed that ten large pillars of fire had erupted in the waters southeast of the island. At 6:50 PM, eleven more large fires were confirmed to have erupted in the waters from the east to the southeast. The above reports have confirmed these to be the results of attacks by the Special Attack Force of the Japanese Divine Wind Corps.

Tokyo, 23rd (Central News Agency): Since 7:00 AM on the 22nd, enemy landing forces on Iwo Jima, under the cover of naval bombardment and heavy and medium tank units, have advanced towards the southern village area. After fierce counterattacks by the first line of Japanese troops, the two armies are now engaged in fierce fighting. At the same time, Japanese tank units have also launched fierce battles against enemy tank units. Meanwhile, an enemy force on the western side of the island, along with a tank unit, attempted to advance from the Chishima village area towards the Tun Su-tai area in the north. After a brave counterattack by Japanese troops in that area, they were repulsed and pursued to one kilometer southwest of the village. As of 7:00 PM on the 22nd, the enemy on the west coast had been forced to retreat from several locations west of Chishima village. At the same time, due to fierce attacks by Japanese troops in the south to the northern geothermal areas, the enemy was forced to retreat from the first line. As a result, the enemy's attempt to reach the Motoyama airfield through the geothermal area has been fiercely blocked by Japanese troops in the front. Since landing on the 19th, the enemy forces, disregarding losses, have attempted to forcibly advance, but due to continuous counterattacks by Japanese troops, they have not only completely stopped but have also suffered continuous damage to their entire force, resulting in a weakening of combat power and a state of forced retreat.

White Blade Battles Unfold in the Nigane Beach Area

Tokyo, 23rd (Central News Agency): Japanese raiding parties on Iwo Jima attacked the enemy's first-line sentry posts from late at night on the 20th to the morning of the 21st, destroying numerous enemy supply warehouses, weapons, and ammunition. Furthermore, a unit of Japanese troops is currently active near the enemy's landing point in the Nigane beach area, engaging in white-blade battles with the enemy and killing many of them.

Tokyo, 23rd (Central News Agency): On the evening of the 22nd, the enemy forces on Iwo Jima established two pontoon bridges at the southern landing point in the southeastern part of the island, with two transport ships docked. These pontoon bridges were within the firing range of Japanese forces. Due to fierce attacks, they became difficult to use.

Central Pacific Base, 23rd (Central News Agency): Three days have passed since enemy forces landed on Iwo Jima. Through the courageous interception of Japanese forces, they have not advanced an inch. At present, the front lines of the two armies remain unchanged compared to the evening of the 20th. However, the enemy forces are still building bridgeheads in areas such as the south wharf and the south airfield, and reinforcements are continuously landing from the south coast, numbering over ten thousand. As of 6:00 PM on the 21st, the enemy's first line seemed to have formed a front line from the western landing point to the Chishima Fortress, Funami-dai, and Takasago-dai landing points. They concentrated tanks and artillery in the southern area of Funami-dai and continued to transport soldiers and equipment to the front from the south airfield and the vicinity of the landing point, creating a chaotic situation. However, the enemy forces have only appeared north of the airfield, subjecting the Japanese positions in the north to heavy artillery fire. The morale of the Japanese troops is high. The northern positions constructed on the high ground are considered to be a strong and impregnable fortress painstakingly completed by the Japanese. Japanese troops are holding the positions, subjecting the enemy forces to heavy artillery fire or incendiary rounds, causing them heavy casualties. It is reported that the Japanese troops in the Suribachi-yama position are fighting bravely against a superior number of enemies, disregarding the enemy's encirclement.

Nimitz Announces the Battle Situation on Iwo Jima

Lisbon, 23rd (Central News Agency): The Nimitz Headquarters announced on the 22nd: "Due to the fierce resistance of the Japanese troops on Iwo Jima, the American troops have made little progress. American troops have now landed another Marine division to increase their strength. The Japanese troops are fiercely resisting with artillery and white-blade attacks." Furthermore, a United Press report on the 22nd stated: "The landing enemy forces, gradually advancing north towards the central airfield, have been completely blocked in front of the airfield. The resistance of the Japanese troops in the southern region is also gradually increasing. American troops are currently holding the Suribachi-yama position, engaging in fierce battles with Japanese troops using tanks and flamethrowers. On the afternoon of the 21st, due to fierce counterattacks by Japanese troops on the east side of Suribachi-yama, American troops lost four tanks. Moreover, the American and Japanese troops have now engaged in close combat, and the American troops can no longer obtain air cover, relying only on tanks, flamethrowers, machine guns, and other firearms to continue fighting the Japanese troops. American medical units, coastal cargo handling units, and soldiers in landing craft are all subjected to shelling by Japanese troops. This time, another Marine division has re-landed, so the total force has reached four divisions, and they are still continuing to fight hard." Furthermore, war correspondent Landzback described the fierce battle as follows: "There is no fixed front line on the fiercely contested Iwo Jima. The entire small island is covered in gray dust, and at night it is surrounded by cold air. Since the American naval forces arrived near the southern airfield on the 19th, that area and the Suribachi-yama area have become the front line. In fact, the entire coastal area within range of artillery fire has become a front line. Because the entire island is only five miles long, and because the Japanese artillery fire is very fierce, there is no so-called safe zone. Japanese troops are currently using all the caves and other cover on the island to fiercely resist. In recent days, American troops have used thousands of tons of bombs to bombard Japanese positions from the sea and air, but the Japanese resistance has not diminished. On the third day of the landing operation, the enemy forces have felt that this island is the only difficult battlefield in the Pacific. As for how much time it will take to completely destroy the island, no one can say for sure."

Lisbon, 23rd (Central News Agency): According to a dispatch from Washington, a United Press dispatch from the Pacific Fleet Headquarters stated: "From the night of February 21st to the 22nd, the four front lines of the American Marine Corps on Iwo Jima repeatedly blocked fierce counterattacks. On February 22nd, they began an attack towards the central airfield. The American Marine Corps were subjected to fierce shelling by Japanese troops. As of the afternoon of the 22nd, American troops advanced slowly in the rain, destroying several Japanese artillery positions, weakening their airfield, but there was little change on the front lines. The American troops on Suribachi-yama corresponded with the northern front line and began another offensive. By noon, American troops launched an attack on the front of Suribachi-yama under the most difficult circumstances. The American fleet subjected the Japanese positions in the northern region of Iwo Jima to heavy artillery fire. Although under rainy and poor weather conditions, the naval air force still provided heavy artillery, machine gun strafing, and artillery support to the ground forces. On the 21st, Japanese bombers and fighter squadrons attacked several American surface ships around Iwo Jima, causing many difficulties for the ships. As of 5:45 PM on the 21st, the total casualties of the ground troops amounted to 4,553. The landing of logistics supplies is very difficult due to the volcanic coastline. It is still continuing."

Lisbon, 22nd (Central News Agency): According to reports from the front lines, fierce battles are continuing day and night on Iwo Jima, centered on the Suribachi-yama area and the northern area of the south airfield. A communiqué issued by the Nimitz Headquarters on the 21st stated: "The Fifth Amphibious Task Force, having gained a foothold near the south airfield, attacked the central airfield on the 21st. Another unit is currently engaged in battle with Japanese troops in the south of the island. The naval forces assisting the two battlefields are engaged in a major battle for every inch of ground due to the intense firing of Japanese artillery and rocket launchers. Furthermore, Japanese troops are currently counterattacking all the strongholds within the area invaded by American troops. On the night of the 20th, Japanese troops attacked the American left wing under the cover of artillery fire and tanks. The American troops were forced to use naval guns to fire shells and flares to cover their ground forces in combat. From this, it can be seen that the American troops are currently in a state of hard fighting."

### Manila Street Battles Continue Fiercely; No Change in Northern Luzon Plains

Luzon Front, 23rd (Central News Agency): The street battles in Manila are currently extremely fierce. Japanese garrison troops are holding the ruins of the old city of Intramuros and its nearby central government offices, city hall, and buildings near the University of the Philippines, launching strong and fierce counterattacks. The vicinity of Nichols Airfield, the Paseo area in the south of Manila, the vicinity of Paco, and the coastal areas have become battlefields everywhere. Because the enemy forces have repeatedly failed to capture the city, after declaring the destructive attack, they began a terrible shelling and bombing from the 21st onwards. Later, towards evening, they invaded a corner of the city with three tanks and 500 infantry, but due to the naval forces of Japan coordinating fierce counterattacks, they were eventually repulsed. In the vicinity of Nichols Airfield and the Paseo area in the south of Manila, the naval forces of Japan launched courageous ramming tactics against the enemy, and the fierce fighting is extremely intense. In the battle near Paco, six enemy tanks have been destroyed, over 400 enemy soldiers have been killed or wounded, and many flamethrowers and other weapons have been captured. The land and naval forces of Japan on Corregidor Island are still securing the positions on the surrounding hills and dense forests, launching fierce battles against the enemy, causing great damage to the enemy. Also, the artillery on the island still in the hands of the Japanese is shelling dozens of enemy warships that are patrolling around the island and occasionally shelling it with naval guns. At the same time, they are preventing enemy warships from invading Manila Bay from the North and South Channels.

Tokyo, 23rd (Central News Agency): Japanese troops who departed from the highlands northeast of Manila attacked the enemy at Angat on the 17th, repulsing 600 enemies and continuing to attack, inflicting great damage on them. Furthermore, Japanese troops who broke into Meycauayan encircled approximately 150 enemies carrying five armored vehicles near Bulacan, five kilometers northeast of the city, and annihilated them at 3:00 PM on the 17th, capturing four armored vehicles and destroying another. The Japanese troops in that area gradually returned to their original state from the night of the 20th. The Japanese troops who were stubbornly holding on to Intramuros (within the old city) continued their tough defense and repeatedly launched attacks on the enemy. At the same time, the Japanese troops at the Mckinley Barracks in the southeast also launched a bloody and courageous battle against the enemy. The enemy forces were still attempting to reinforce their forces at Camp Crame. In addition to reinforcing their forces in the Marikina area north of Manila, they also reinforced Manila from the Aklan area south of Manila.

Tokyo, 23rd (Central News Agency): There has been no major change in the battle situation in the northern plains of Central Luzon in recent days. However, enemy forces attempting to break through the Japanese defensive lines in the area between San Jose and Salasa and attempt to encircle the rear of the Japanese positions at San Jose were counterattacked by Japanese troops when they moved out, inflicting a severe blow and forcing them to retreat to the west. There has been almost no change on the Santo Tomas front. On the Pozorrubio front, Japanese troops launched a counterattack on the 16th against a strong enemy force, inflicting considerable damage on them. Japanese troops on the Tarlac and San Jose fronts launched brave attacks against the enemy at any time, destroying a pair of heavy howitzers on the night of the 16th and destroying several of their supply warehouses. The enemy in that area attempted to encircle the rear of the Japanese positions at San Isidro, disrupting the Japanese rear, but were heavily attacked by the Japanese side and began to retreat on the 17th.

### Millions of Troops on the Eastern Front Launch Decisive Battle; Soviet Forces on the Southern Flank Reach the Banks of the Nizh River

Berlin, 23rd (Central News Agency): Huitong News Agency: The great battle raging around Guben and west of Breslau in Silesia, and in West Prussia and Pomerania, is intensifying, and the clash of millions of troops is entering a new phase. The situation is particularly tense with Soviet forces reinforcing and advancing on the directions of Crossen, Frankfurt, and Küstrin. The current lull in the key battle locations seems to be the calm before a storm.

Berlin, 23rd (German News Agency): Within the past two days, two focal points have emerged in the Silesia region. The first is west of Breslau, where Soviet forces are constantly transferring infantry and artillery formations, pressing the German covering artillery force in front of the Riesengebirge (Giant Mountains), while also attacking the Breslau fortress from the south. The second major battle focus is in the Lauban-Görlitz area, where Soviet forces have expanded their large-scale combat to the Nizh River. Soviet forces reached the river on Wednesday along a wide front, as far as Guben.

Fierce Fighting in East Prussia; German Forces Withdraw from Zinten

Berlin, 23rd (German News Agency): On Wednesday, the battle in East Prussia unfolded into a large-scale affair, with approximately 2,000 Soviet aircraft constantly assisting ground operations. Although Soviet ammunition and tanks are of extremely superior quality, there were no noteworthy victories to be mentioned on that day. The main Soviet formations are currently concentrated near Braunsberg and the Zinten area. Other powerful Soviet forces are fiercely attacking the German line in Samland, their objective clearly being to sever the connection between Königsberg and the sea. After several hours of fierce fighting in the city of Zinten, German forces had to withdraw to the west. At that time, the area was completely leveled. Near Braunsberg, Soviet forces attacked east and northeast all day long on both sides of the highway, where a large tank battle unfolded.

Stockholm, Sweden, 23rd (Central News Agency): Huitong News Agency: Last night, Moscow admitted for the second time that Soviet forces had again withdrawn from the Samland peninsula. Soviet reports stated that, after a counterattack by a large German force, Soviet forces were forced to retreat from the northern coast of the bay.

### Denmark Under German Military Control Declares Martial Law

Stockholm, Sweden, 23rd (Central News Agency): Regarding the resolutions of the Crimean Conference, the Allied forces are reportedly launching attacks on Germany from all four directions (east, south, west, and north). Recent discussions have focused on the Allied forces’ northward push into Germany. According to a report from Copenhagen, the German military authorities stationed in Denmark have been broadcasting daily throughout Denmark since the 22nd, declaring a state of emergency from 8 PM to 4 AM the following morning.

### Soviet Army Casualties Since the Start of the War Reach Fifteen Million

Lisbon, 23rd (Central News Agency): According to a report from New York, Shen Hanli, a well-known anti-Soviet commentator, stated in a notification in New York on the 21st that the Soviet Union has lost 15 million personnel in this war.

### International Cotton Advisory Committee Meeting to Be Held Next Month in Washington, D.C.

Lisbon, 23rd (Central News Agency): Huitong News Agency reports that the U.S. State Department announced that the International Cotton Advisory Committee will hold its fourth meeting in Washington, D.C. on March 26th.

### Allied Aircraft Attack Germany, Shoot Down Over a Hundred; No Change in the Western Front

Berlin, 23rd (Central News Agency): On the 21st, Allied aircraft attacked Berlin and the Rhine-Westphalia region in the west, and bombed Winnöenburg. The German air defense forces shot down 117 of them that day and night, mostly four-engine heavy bombers. The German Air Force's night fighters were particularly active in this operation.

Berlin, 23rd (Central News Agency): Huitong News Agency reports: Eisenhower's major offensive into northern Germany has not yet materialized. The First Canadian Army is on the northern flank, the U.S. Third Army is on the southern flank, and two-thirds of the British Second Army and the U.S. First and Ninth Armies are in the central part of the Western Front, but have not yet exerted their combat power. One air transport division has also not participated in the battle. The major battle between the German army and the British and American forces has not yet begun. The British and Canadian armies are applying pressure between the Rhine and Meuse rivers, but have not succeeded. The U.S. Third Army is making even slower progress and suffering heavier losses. The launch of a major offensive on the Ruhr River front is also far from certain. However, it is also possible that Eisenhower will seek other developments.

### Germany Reduces Food Rations

Berlin, 23rd (Central News Agency): The German government announced that in order to ensure food rations for April, temporary measures are being taken to temporarily reduce the ration amount by 12.5%.

### Soviet Forces Attacking Germany Cause Concern for Britain and the United States

After the Soviet Red Army launched a large-scale artillery bombardment on January 12th, they immediately launched an unprecedented winter offensive from the Sandomierz area. This was expected by Germany, which has always known the strength of the Soviet Union and that it would be able to launch a surprising offensive, so Germany calmly responded. The United Nations' plan to invade German territory on the Western Front suffered a disastrous defeat, so the Soviet Red Army launched a massive offensive from the east to seek a surrender under the city walls. The numerical superiority of the United Nations forces over the German forces has been fully demonstrated on all battlefields, especially on the Eastern Front. Before this Soviet winter offensive was launched, according to the estimates of neutral military experts, the Soviet forces were as follows:

Soviet Military Strength

East Prussian border area: 20 to 30 infantry divisions, 10 armored divisions, 10 to 20 artillery regiments.

East Prussia to Warsaw area: 20 infantry divisions, 20 armored divisions, 10 artillery regiments.

Warsaw to southern Poland area: 40 infantry divisions, 30 armored divisions, 25 artillery regiments.

Krakow and Upper Silesia: 25 to 30 infantry divisions, 20 armored divisions, 20 artillery regiments.

In addition, the Petrov army (Fourth Ukrainian Front) operating in Czechoslovakia has 15 infantry divisions, 5 armored divisions, and 2 artillery regiments. On the Hungarian front, there are another 20 to 30 infantry divisions, 10 to 20 armored divisions, and 5 artillery regiments, as well as the Romanian army that surrendered to the Soviet Union, about 10 infantry divisions. Against such a powerful Soviet army, the German army has only one-fifth of its strength, or at most no more than one-half. However, Germany has reserve troops in the rear. It is generally estimated that there are two armored divisions stationed in Frankfurt on the Oder River, two to three elite guard divisions, and a similar number of Volksgrenadier divisions.

Political Infighting

This Soviet military breakthrough of the German front is the largest of the Soviet military offensives. But what is most noteworthy is that this Soviet winter offensive happened to coincide with the time when Britain and the United States were launching political offensives against Germany and the Soviet Union. In addition, the United Nations failed to break through the German defense line on the Western Front, but the Soviet Red Army won a major victory on the Eastern Front.

Therefore, it can also be said that the Soviet Union thwarted the political offensives of Britain and the United States. Due to its military achievements, the Soviet Union has already gained a vast sphere of influence in Eastern Europe, Central Europe, and Southeastern Europe. However, the United States believes that the Soviet Union's rapid development was entirely instigated by Britain. Now Britain is unable to resolve the internal disputes in Poland, Yugoslavia, Czechoslovakia, Italy, Greece, and other countries. Britain and the United States are astonished at seeing their powerful ally exerting unimaginable power, and have no choice but to give in to the Soviet Union. Therefore, in order to limit this behavior of the Soviet Union, Britain and the United States had to urgently seek to convene a summit of the three major powers. However, the recent Soviet military developments on the Eastern Front have completely shattered the optimistic psychology that Britain and the United States had been so confident in the past.

In other words, initially, due to the Red Army's rapid military success, Britain and the United States were overjoyed, thinking that the war was about to end, but now their joy has turned to worry.

Soviet Strategy

What is Stalin's intention in adopting this blitzkrieg tactic? Is Stalin perhaps dealing with Germany in the same way as he is dealing with other European countries, trying to expand the Soviet Union's influence?

This is what Britain and the United States are worried about. At the same time, within Britain and the United States, there are many people who are criticizing and condemning the failure of the Western Front to progress according to plan. The public opinion circles in Britain and the United States must break through the German defense line as soon as possible. The realist Stalin, seeing that Britain and the United States are at a loss with the domestic political problems of the "liberated countries," believes that this is the best opportunity to launch an offensive. The summit of the three countries has already been held. If Britain does not resolve many problems as soon as possible in the face of its powerful allies, it will not be able to show its true colors.

Student Aid News for Readers

### Joint Charity Performance by University Students; "Fleeting Wealth" to Be Performed for Charity Today and Tomorrow; Tickets Sold in Addition to Pre-Sold Honorary Tickets

Students from fourteen universities in the city, including St. John's, Shanghai, Aurora, Aurora Women's College, Fudan, Comparative Law School of China, Jiaotong, East China, Datong, Daxia, Wend, Nantong, Franco-Chinese Institute, and German Medical School, have been preparing for two months for a joint charity performance of the stage play "Fleeting Wealth" to raise funds for the readers' student aid fund of this newspaper. The dress rehearsal yesterday morning at 10 AM was very successful. It has been decided that performances will be held at the Guanxin Grand Theater at 10 AM and 7 PM this morning and tomorrow. At that time, we respectfully request the support of people from all walks of life to attend and provide guidance to express our gratitude.

This joint charity performance of "Fleeting Wealth" initiated by students from various universities to raise student aid funds is entirely voluntary. All work related to rehearsals and donations is also entirely undertaken by the students. The student aid fund office only provides guidance and supervision. This semester, tuition fees at various schools have skyrocketed along with prices, while industry and commerce are very depressed. As a result, donations to this year's student aid fund were not very enthusiastic at first. This situation aroused the spirit of self-help and mutual assistance among the students of various schools. In addition to this charity performance, 96 special fundraising teams are entirely composed of students from various schools. Recently, the charity bazaar jointly organized by the two new newspapers and the Young Men's and Women's Christian Associations also achieved unexpectedly satisfactory results due to the enthusiastic efforts of the students from various schools. The academic achievements of the student aid students were publicly exhibited before the rainy season for inspection by all sectors of society. This year's charity performance, charity bazaar, and fundraising work can also be said to be an opportunity for all sectors of society to inspect their extracurricular work spirit. This kind of activity also adds valuable experience to themselves. Because of the short time, this charity performance was not fully prepared, but we deeply believe that each role can do their best according to the plot of the play, predicting that the students of various schools will be able to make contributions to the country and society in the future. Participation in the charity performance, charity bazaar, and fundraising work is not limited to student aid students. The enthusiasm and efforts of other students are even more admirable.

Please Pay Attention to Ticket Exchange Time

All those holding honorary tickets and regular tickets, originally scheduled for 2 PM on the 17th, can exchange them at 10 AM on the 24th; and tickets for 7 PM on the 17th, can exchange them at 7 PM on the 24th. Also, tickets for 2 PM on the 18th, can exchange them at 10 AM on the 25th; and tickets for 7 PM on the 18th, can exchange them at 7 PM on the 25th. Now, to reduce trouble, there is no need to make a reservation, and you can exchange them as soon as you arrive. This is very important.

Shanghai University Wins Two Banners

This joint charity performance of "Fleeting Wealth" by fourteen universities has received enthusiastic support and generous donations from all sectors of society, achieving satisfactory results. Students from various schools have been working day and night to promote ticket sales, and their spirit is commendable. It is reported that Shanghai University has achieved the best ticket sales among the fourteen universities, with a total of 1.2 million yuan, winning the group banner. Pei Huizhen, a student from the Department of Political Science of the university, achieved the best individual ticket sales, with a total of 300,000 yuan, winning the championship. Zhang Xiaofang, a student from the Department of Sociology, won the second place with a total of 230,000 yuan. This has become a popular story.

Lin Yinming wrote: "Regarding the incident that I handled at the beginning of the month, because the original party breached the contract, I lost credibility with Mr. Jing Shuping and Mr. Shi Yongshun, causing Mr. Shi to suffer losses. Now, thanks to the understanding of the two gentlemen, they have returned the 200,000 yuan in Central Reserve Bank notes that I compensated to Mr. Shi, and refused to accept it. I feel ashamed and guilty in my heart. Now, in the name of Mr. Jing and Mr. Shi, I will donate the funds to your newspaper's student aid fund and the Xinwenbao's loan scholarship fund, each 100,000 yuan, to benefit the two gentlemen and thank them for their spirit of chivalry."

### Police and Military Authorities Determined to Cooperate, Enforce New Price Ceilings, and Issue Specific Measures Hoping Merchants Will Comply

In order to thoroughly suppress prices and stabilize the people's livelihood in this city, the economic authorities have adopted emergency measures, and the Price Review Committee has assessed and set price ceilings for eleven major commodities, which have been announced and implemented. The Municipal Police Department is determined to cooperate in maintaining these newly established price ceilings. With the assistance of the military and police authorities, the Fourth Division of the Economic Police Team will take firm and decisive measures. All outstanding economic police officers have been mobilized to form investigation teams of three officers each, cooperating with military police to conduct thorough investigations in shops and markets throughout the city. Those who violate the regulations will be severely punished upon verification. A reporter from the Central News Agency made a special visit to the person in charge of the team yesterday. According to him, the team is fully determined to maintain the new price ceilings in order to stabilize the people's livelihood. As for the specific measures, it is hoped that merchants will cherish themselves, strictly abide by them, and avoid breaking the law.

Enforce Formal Labeling

(1) For all goods, all shops must mark the price on the item, using labels, so that citizens can see it at a glance when shopping, and merchants must not take advantage of this to raise prices at will. Violators will be punished. (2) Issue invoices, regardless of the format. For the sale of any item, shops and companies must issue invoices to ensure fairness. However, the format of the invoice is not restricted, but if there are false invoices, it will be considered a violation and severely punished. (3) Enforce government orders. Regardless of the reason, the Economic Police will enforce the new price ceilings. That is, all goods must be sold in accordance with the new price ceilings. Even if merchants have any reason to raise prices, the team will ignore them and severely punish them in accordance with the law.

Strictly Punish Refusal to Sell

Any shops or businesses that have goods and refuse to sell them in accordance with the new price ceilings will also be severely punished. As for wholesale businesses, although the authorities do not limit wholesale prices, the principle is that the maximum profit should not exceed 20%. For example, if the price ceiling is 1,000 yuan, the wholesale price should only be 800 yuan. Violators will also be punished. For the above measures, the chairmen of the various trade associations should closely assist the authorities and urge their colleagues to implement them faithfully. If any colleague or shop violates the law, the chairman of the relevant trade association will also be held jointly liable. It is hoped that citizens will cooperate in reporting illegal merchants for investigation and prosecution.

### Winter Relief Committee Schedules Meeting, Distributes Winter Clothing

The Municipal Winter Relief Committee, in order to distribute winter clothing, convened twenty-seven organizations including public welfare, charitable, and moral groups at 3:00 PM on the 23rd to hold the first representative conference for distributing clothing. Those present included Hu Shouqi from the Social Welfare Bureau, Qiu Lihua from the Child Protection Section of the Health Bureau, Chen Zhiqing, the town head of Xujiahui, An Ziying, the district chief of the Salvation Army, and more than thirty others. Chairman Huang Jingwan delivered the opening speech, followed by speeches by Hu Shouqi, Ding Bingnan, Zhang Zhiyu, An Ziying, Zhang Yichen, Dong Zizu, and others, who expressed many opinions on the methods and precautions for distributing winter clothing. The following was then decided: (1) Apply for winter clothing procedures starting immediately, (2) Distribute winter clothing in various districts starting on March 1, (3) The winter clothing work will end on March 10. It is reported that the Winter Relief Committee's work on distributing clothing in the 33rd year (of the Republic) was originally planned to be completed earlier, but due to procedures such as donations, the allocation of cotton cloth, and sewing and distribution, it had to be delayed until now. However, the authorities' concern for the poor is especially worthy of praise. It is heard that the committee's goal of making 12,600 sets of winter clothing has now been achieved. In addition to the total of 10,400 sets to be distributed to the various groups, the remaining surplus will be reserved for special purposes in the future.

### Director Zhou Distributes Six Million Yuan in New Year Bonuses to Subordinates

Police Chief Zhou, who is also the director of the city's police force, has issued six million yuan in bonuses to his subordinates from the deputy director down to the section chiefs, to encourage them during the Spring Festival. The distribution method is: 53,000 yuan per person for the deputy director level, 30,000 yuan per person for the section chief level, 15,000 yuan per person for the deputy section chief level, and 8,000 yuan per person for the section director level. Other personnel of the same level will be issued according to the previous standards according to their respective ranks. The payments were issued by the accounting section of the First Division of the bureau, starting at 11:00 AM on the 21st. As for the police officers below the section director level, 35 million yuan in donations from the Citizens' Welfare Association will be distributed by grade.

In September of last year, Wang Chonghua sent a letter seeking employment and was assigned as a traveling reporter. He was suspended after a half-month trial period. It is recently learned that the person still uses this paper's business card outside. In addition to investigating this, we hope that all sectors of society will pay attention and not be fooled.

### Mr. Zhang Mengqu Passed Away in Beijing

Mr. Zhang Mengqu, named Ertian, was from Hang County, Zhejiang. He was well-versed in classics and history, and also studied Buddhism and medicine. He was the author of books such as "History of Weihou Feizhuan" and "Baihoutong Kao," which were famous at home and abroad, and especially admired by Japanese and German people. When the Qing History Museum was established, Zhao Erxun admired him and invited him to be a co-editor. To compile national history in plain clothes was indeed an unusual event. Later, he taught at Peking University, National Chengchi University, Jiaotong University, and other schools. His students were all over the world. Recently, news came from Beijing that Mr. Zhang passed away in Beijing on the morning of February 19 (the seventh day of the first lunar month). His old friends at sea all mourned him. It is heard that Mr. Zhang was poor and his funeral was simple. Since there was no way to prepare for the funeral, relatives and friends planned to raise funds to help with the funeral.

### Reconstruction Bank and Bank, Re-Elect Official and Business Directors and Supervisors

After the Shanghai Special City Reconstruction Bank increased its capital, the originally appointed official and business directors and supervisors should be re-appointed and re-elected according to the rules. Regarding the election of business directors and supervisors, the shareholder meeting was opened in October last year. Sun Yaodong, Chen Shaowei, Wang Yizhi, Shen Jixuan, and Li Liwen were elected as directors, and Ji Yilong was elected as a supervisor. All official directors and supervisors were also appointed by the municipal government: Zhou Fohai, Luo Junqiang, Zhao Shuyong, Xu Jiang, Shen Guanzhun, and Ling Xianwen as directors, and Liu Xingquan and Xu Songping as supervisors. On the afternoon of February 20, the bank held the first joint meeting of directors and supervisors after the capital increase in the municipal government conference room. Zhou, the mayor, and Luo, the secretary-general, were unanimously elected as managing directors. Sun Yaodong, another business managing director, was re-elected. Zhou, the managing director, was also appointed as the chairman of the board by the municipal government to preside over the bank's affairs.

Sports

### Basketball Finals Last Night Ended Without Result

In the Public Basketball League, the two winning teams from Group A and Group B, Donghua and Zhongbei, met in the finals last night. Unexpectedly, when the game reached the last eight minutes, the Donghua team questioned referee Wang Jien's decision, believing it to be wrong. The referee ruled that Donghua had forfeited the game, while Donghua declared that it reserved the right to protest. The game ended unhappily. Last night, Donghua was in the lead all the way, with the score being 30 to 24. In the other two women's matches, Sansheng won against Overseas Chinese with a score of 27 to 15, and the Green Team won against Lianyi with a score of 54 to 12.

### Thoughts on Song Zhengyin's Oil Paintings

— Wen Zhaotong

Currently, people seem to have forgotten art, forgetting this highest form of human cultural activity. We see: the Shanghai art scene is so desolate, perhaps there are one or two art exhibitions that gather sporadically. But, when asked what its essence is? It turns out to be just a gathering for excitement.

Although the oil painting exhibition of the young painter Song Zhenggu is not particularly eye-catching, at least he is not like the usual gathering for excitement. He is presenting the true results of studying art, explaining how he studies? And explaining what he is studying?

Mr. Song's entire output is about forty or fifty works, including figures, landscapes, and still lifes. His style tends to be very new. But, this new trend may be the reason for the young painter's self-indulgence. However, there will be no such danger in Mr. Song's art, because Mr. Song is developing in many ways in terms of expressive techniques. This is a general characteristic of modern art.

Ten years ago, my old friend Liu Shi Jun, graduated from the Department of Art of Japan University. After returning to Shanghai, he held a solo exhibition. The Chinese people regarded his works as having the general characteristics of modern art. In the past ten years, I have not heard of anyone succeeding him. Now Mr. Song also graduated from the school, and his artistic style is exactly the same. If it is said that he and Mr. Liu complement each other on the domestic art scene, who would say it is not appropriate?

### University Alumni Advancement Association, Amusement Fair Postponed

Rescheduled for March 14

The University Alumni Advancement Association, together with university alumni, launched a grand amusement fair to respond to this newspaper's education assistance and poverty relief campaign. The planned entertainment programs include the drama "Happy Reunion" and the Peking opera "Chun Qiu Pei." In order to strengthen the lineup, celebrities and singers were invited, as well as the Happiness Orchestra's Hawaiian music. Although the alumni have been enthusiastically working hard, due to the scale of the event, it was not possible to prepare in time, so it could not be performed as scheduled. It has now been decided to postpone the performance to 2:00 PM on March 14 at the original Jin Cheng site. All the tickets issued before will be valid at that time. It is hoped that all sponsors will understand. It is also reported that the association has scheduled a meeting for cadres at its association on Jiujiang Road at 4:00 PM on the 25th of this month. All members are requested to attend on time.

### Please Uphold the Righteousness of Respecting the Worthy and Providing Generous Support to Scholars

Since the war started in our country, scholars from all over the country have taken refuge in the corners of Shanghai. Many of them are living in difficult circumstances, bordering on utter exhaustion. These people have devoted their entire lives to academic pursuits, and they are truly the backbone of the country and the essence of the nation. They stand tall like the spiritual light of the Lu Temple, admired by scholars. But now they are ashamed of empty bottles and hungry stomachs! I hope that the many wealthy people in Shanghai will admire Wei Gongzi's lofty style of being friendly to Zisi, and treat these scholars with the righteousness of respecting the worthy, providing generous support, and giving regular salaries and food, so as to alleviate their worries about life and enable them to concentrate on researching and writing. If this is the case, then it will not only be the private fortune of the recipients, but also benefit the promotion of scholarship, the cultivation of customs, and the future of the country and nation! (Huang Jingwan)

### Expanded Tuberculosis Prevention, X-Ray Examination Time

The Hongqiao Sanatorium in this city, in view of recent statistical reports that tuberculosis is extremely rampant, and also due to the daytime power restrictions, has expanded the fire-visiting tuberculosis X-ray examination time, changing it to every night from 6:00 PM to 8:00 PM. This will greatly help to popularize early diagnosis and promote tuberculosis prevention work. It is hoped that the general public will plan ahead and carry out the examination as soon as possible, and not miss this opportunity. The location is 990 Taishan Road.

### Continuing to Send Injury Treatment Vouchers

Lin Zhentang has always been enthusiastic about charitable undertakings. It has made a great wish to print free injury treatment vouchers, distribute them to the poor and sick, and invite Mr. Tong Zhongyi, a martial arts expert, to be responsible for medical services. I have received one hundred copies twice before, and they have been sent out. Now I have received another fifty copies, which I will distribute on your behalf. Patients can pick them up from this office and be introduced to the clinic. After diagnosis, all injury medicines and ointments required will be provided free of charge. However, because the medicine is expensive, costing at least hundreds for minor cases and thousands for serious cases, it must be limited to the truly poor and sick. The location is 23, Lane 124, Southern Section, Tongfu Road, Weihaiwei Road. Time: 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM. Serious illnesses are treated immediately.

### Canadian Condensed Milk Charity Sale to Help the Children's Relief Association

The Chinese Children's Relief Association held a fundraising campaign last year, and the results were satisfactory. However, due to the sharp rise in prices and high expenses, it is still difficult to continue to provide for the more than 300 orphans currently being cared for. Now, Qu Chaojun, feeling sorry for the young children, has specially donated two bags of corn flour, totaling 400 catties, for the association's orphans' food. He will also sell 48 cans of Canadian condensed milk saved by his son and others through a charity sale. The minimum bid price is 72,000 yuan (calculated at 1,500 yuan per can), and all proceeds from the sale will be used to help the Children's Relief Association's expenses in order to maximize the effect of relief. According to Qi Chaojun's opinion, the condensed milk is produced by Haining Foreign Company, 13 and a half taels per can, and the current market price is 1,680 yuan per can. Buyers not only do not suffer losses, but also benefit from a very meaningful good deed. It's a win-win situation. It is expected that enthusiastic people will be happy to make this happen, and it will not disappoint Qi Chaojun's efforts. (Buyers can contact the association, phone number 82273).

### The Problem of Population Dispersion

— Jin Xiong Bai

Regarding the issue of dispersing the population of Shanghai, whether it is to reduce the harm of air raids or to maintain the supply of food and public order in Shanghai, it is a matter of urgent importance. The municipal government has already decided to organize a dispersion committee to handle this matter full-time, and the municipal advisory committee will also assist it with all its strength, so that the key points can be grasped and the details worked out. In the near term, it will definitely be able to proceed smoothly step by step.

The dispersion method decided this time is based on the principle of being voluntary. Of course, charitable institutions such as nursing homes, orphanages, and disability homes, which have no need to stay in Shanghai, should be forcibly dispersed. So, what is the total number of residents who will be voluntarily dispersed in the first step? We can only guess now that there are indeed many who are willing to leave Shanghai, but the exact number is still impossible to count. Handling dispersion is not only a difficult task, but also requires too much funding. If the number of people in the first step cannot be determined, once it is implemented, many difficulties will be felt. Therefore, I advocate that the number of registered people and the location of their return to their hometown should be determined immediately. Only after this can the funding and preparation of transportation be thoroughly resolved. As for the organization handling the registration, I think that the various hometown associations and citizen welfare associations are duty-bound.

Second, before dispersing the population, everyone is paying attention to the transportation problem. The difficulty of transportation, poor management, and the extortion of hooligans and irresponsible staff will all affect the progress of the work, which is indeed a serious problem. But I don't think this is the most threatening problem, because with the strength of the city government and all the citizens, it is still enough to overcome this difficulty under the current environment. If the dispersion of the population is only to help them get train tickets and ship tickets, and how to escort them onto the train and ship, then our dispersion work has already determined the root cause of failure. A certain kind of resident wants to leave Shanghai because they feel that there may be some kind of danger in the future. They have the financial resources themselves, and they also have their own methods of transportation, which are of course not within the scope of our work. The target of our work is, first, part of them still have property or work in their hometowns to maintain their livelihoods, or they are working in Shanghai and plan to send their families back home. What they need help with is only the transportation problem. The second type is those who cannot live in Shanghai and have nowhere to return. The dispersion of the former is relatively easy, as long as the transportation problem is solved. The latter type of residents is more troublesome. The fundraising for travel expenses, the selection of dispersion locations, the maintenance of life after arrival, and the attention to management not only require a lot of money and a long time, but especially reliable, capable and responsible staff.

The timing is getting more and more urgent, and we should decide and implement it immediately. If we wait until we have to disperse before starting to handle it, it may be too late.

Special Issue on Population Dispersion

### Humble Opinions on Dispersing the Population

— Chen Riping

Since Shanghai opened as a port, it has become the economic and financial center of our country due to its geographical relationship. Moreover, due to frequent internal conflicts in the past, more and more residents of the interior have moved here, regarding it as a place to live and work in peace. The population has increased to as many as five million people.

Since the Sino-Japanese Incident occurred earlier, and the European and Greater East Asia wars followed, overseas transportation has been completely blocked. At this time of increasingly fierce war, the exchanges between various places have become more and more obstructed. This city was originally an industrial and commercial area, and the supply of food depends on all parties. In the event that transportation is cut off and food transportation is insufficient, it is inevitable that various serious situations will arise. Therefore, the issue of dispersing the population of this city is the most urgent issue that needs to be resolved today. In view of this, the municipal government has set up a Population Dispersion Committee to actively promote this matter. However, dispersion work is not easy. Without a detailed plan and careful preparation, it is not enough to achieve complete success. I have a few points that must be considered first, listed as follows:

(1) Regarding the Receiving Areas:

A. Ensuring Public Security;

B. Ensuring Food Supply;

C. Facilitating Production Activities.

The public security of the receiving area must first be paid attention to, otherwise repeated relocation will exhaust the people's patience, and the officials will also be overwhelmed. At the same time, whether the food in the area is easy to collect and transport is a concern. I am afraid that the problem in this place will be solved, and the problem in the other place will arise one after another, which is not a perfect solution. Secondly, it is also a hidden worry that the dispersed people are idle all day long. If they can be integrated into production activities, it will benefit both the public and private sectors. Therefore, whether the production activities in the area are convenient should also be paid attention to.

(2) Regarding Transportation:

A. Railways;

B. Waterways;

C. Other Vehicles.

Transportation is essential for dispersion. How to prepare it should be carefully planned and well coordinated, otherwise the effort will be doubled and the result will be halved, and it will be difficult to achieve results quickly.

(3) Dispersion Procedures:

A. Those who have the financial resources and the means should disperse on their own;

B. Those who are supported by charitable relief organizations should ask the organizations to request the Dispersion Committee to find a way;

C. Those who have the financial resources but no means should ask the Dispersion Committee to find a way;

D. Those who have no financial resources and want to disperse should ask their hometown associations or other public welfare and charitable organizations to find a way;

E. The general elderly, weak, women and children should be persuaded to disperse by the various hometown associations or Baojia offices;

F. Those who have no occupation and no fixed residence should be dispersed by the government.

(4) Detailed Measures:

Detailed measures should be discussed and decided by the various hometown associations, public welfare and charitable organizations, Baojia offices, and the Population Dispersion Committee.

The above are just a few suggestions based on my limited knowledge, offered for the consideration of the municipal authorities, and for the discussion of those who care about the issue of dispersing the population of this city.

### Prerequisites for Evacuation

— Zhu Gongming

On the 5th of this month, the newspaper reported on Secretary-General Luo's conversation regarding the evacuation of the city's population, stating that the government has decided to establish a population evacuation committee to actively carry out the task. This demonstrates a profound and far-reaching plan. Observing the current situation, the matter has become extremely urgent. If the evacuation is left to the citizens themselves, it will inevitably lead to delays and errors, making it difficult to achieve the government's planned evacuation of one million people. This is because the psychology of the citizens tends to be complacent, and they often do not feel anxious until a crisis is imminent. Expecting them to evacuate on their own will inevitably lead to delays and mistakes, resulting in very little success. The government should step forward to actively supervise and guide, so that the elderly, weak, women, children, and unnecessary personnel can be evacuated to various places as soon as possible, to avoid unexpected events and unnecessary sacrifices.

Secondly, there is the issue of providing convenience for those being evacuated: Currently, the two major obstacles for travelers are the train stations and wharves, which are truly frightening. The chaotic situation at the North Sixth District of Shanghai has gradually improved after rectification; however, the situation at the steamship wharves is equally chaotic, even worse than at the train stations. Not only is it difficult to buy ship tickets outside of the black market, but every piece of luggage arriving at the port must go through three or four layers of extortion. Even when it is moved into the ship, no matter the suitcase or basket, each piece costs several thousand yuan, sometimes even more than ten thousand yuan. The extent of such black market practices for getting luggage on board can be imagined. Illegal behaviors by the "red and white hats" (porters) at these steamship wharves should naturally be improved.

The restrictions on luggage taken by evacuating citizens should be relaxed. Generally, when citizens return to their hometowns, they do not want to purchase everyday items here due to the high prices, and prefer to buy them in their hometowns. This is especially true for women. Even a small piece of cloth will be taken back to their hometown, unwilling to give it up. Furthermore, due to the lack of supplies in the countryside, such as cotton cloth, towels, foreign-made goods, soap, and matches, they will inevitably prepare to bring some with them, fearing a shortage in the countryside. However, these items are all under control. Often, when the wharves are inspected, those carrying two extra towels or two pairs of foreign socks are immediately taken out and confiscated. Such strict restrictions are a hardship for those evacuating. If families with many children or those who have not returned to their hometowns for many years are carrying daily necessities for their own use and to give to relatives and friends, the quantity often exceeds the limit. In the minds of those carrying them, they still feel that what they are carrying is not enough. In reality, carrying two towels or two pairs of foreign socks can lead to confiscation. For example, for cotton clothing materials, the limit seems to be three yards per person, but in practice, it is difficult to carry even one yard. If based on need, a man's robe requires thirteen feet of material, and a woman's robe requires nine feet. In the minds of those evacuating back to their hometowns, returning today and not knowing when they will return to Shanghai, bringing a piece of clothing material back home is normal. However, one piece of clothing material already exceeds the three-yard limit and can be confiscated by law. Furthermore, if a family of six returns to their hometown at the same time, can the amount of clothing material they carry be combined according to the limit of eighteen yards? This also becomes a problem in reality. Therefore, the restrictions on luggage carried by evacuating citizens returning to their hometowns should be relaxed.

All citizens evacuating back to their hometowns must register with the police station in their jurisdiction beforehand. In addition to registering, the police station should immediately issue a return home permit or "evacuation certificate," and send the list of evacuated people to the evacuation committee daily to facilitate the allocation of transportation. Another copy of the list should be sent to the distribution office to stop rations. After the evacuation committee receives the list from the police station, it will reasonably allocate transportation according to the order of registration, the evacuation route, and the requested transportation. The evacuees will not suffer from the lack of boats or cars, and the authorities can also understand the evacuation situation on each route and the total number of evacuees. In addition to specifying the name, gender, age, place of origin, route, and number of luggage items in the return home permit "or evacuation certificate," it should also indicate that the police and military police along the way should provide preferential treatment and protection and should not cause difficulties. At the same time, the municipal government should separately send letters to the police and military police agencies in various locations, requesting that they provide effective protection for the evacuated people returning to their hometowns.

Again, the number of means of transportation should be increased. In addition to increasing the number of trains on the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou railways and the number of ships on the outer sea and Yangtze River lines, efforts should also be made to increase inland waterway and long-distance buses. In addition, private boats and vehicles should be used on a large scale to ensure that evacuating citizens do not suffer from the inability to leave and the difficulty of moving through the crowds. Other issues, such as restricting individual porters from occupying transportation and selling tickets on the black market, are also within the scope of rectifying transportation and should be resolved together.

Finally, reducing the fare for the evacuating citizens and subsidizing the travel expenses for poor citizens who cannot afford to return to their hometowns are also important issues. If the municipal government and relevant parties can reasonably resolve the above issues, it is expected that the government's plan to evacuate one million citizens will not be difficult to achieve.

### On the Issue of Population Evacuation

— Lu Feng

Wartime Shanghai has too many people. Currently, with the advancement of the war, all transportation and production forces are restricted, but the number of consumers has not decreased. In a state of demand exceeding supply, prices are soaring, and people's livelihoods are insecure. This large population residing in Shanghai not only does not contribute to production but also affects public security. In addition, if Shanghai is subject to air raids, the issue of population evacuation is an urgent matter.

The municipal government has closely organized the Population Evacuation Committee, which is gathering wisdom and discussing comprehensive countermeasures. I believe that the following key points should be considered regarding this issue.

(1) Consider the smooth flow of transportation mechanisms

(2) Adopt a one-stop collective evacuation

(3) Strictly screen those who do not need to reside in Shanghai

(4) Study livelihood strategies for the evacuated population

First, the various restrictions on transportation mechanisms make people feel that the journey is difficult. Coupled with the rampant black market, even necessary travel is inconvenient. Therefore, regarding the evacuation of Shanghai's population, everything cannot proceed without maximizing the strengthening of transportation forces.

Second, charitable organizations, schools, religious groups, factories, and the like should be properly considered for relocation outside the city. The authorities should assist in their evacuation and provide various conveniences.

Third, vagrants without legitimate occupations should be strictly screened and evacuated outside the city.

Fourth, if the above-mentioned forcibly evacuated people cannot make a living outside the city or do not have new friends to assist them, their countermeasures after relocation should be sought. Currently, the policy of China participating in the war is to increase production as the primary task. Therefore, it may be considered to establish light industrial production organizations so that the evacuated population can work and live without waiting for death.

Of course, to make the evacuation of Shanghai's population of more than three million residents a reality, in addition to skillfully using various agencies, a large amount of economic expenditure to subsidize the consumption of the evacuated population is also necessary. This matter is of great importance and requires gathering wisdom and having various authorities and experts study and formulate comprehensive measures to implement it.

### Organization and Work of Evacuation Agencies

— Zhao Yishan

The importance of population evacuation in wartime cities has attracted attention from all sides. The author returned to Shanghai from Hong Kong, where the evacuated population accounted for about half of Hong Kong's population. Since the authorities organized an evacuation agency—the Homecoming Guidance Office—the work has been quite effective. Therefore, to evacuate the population, it is necessary to first establish a sound organization as an agency to guide the evacuation work, so that it can proceed step by step to achieve the expected results. Based on what I know about the organization and work of the Hong Kong "Homecoming Guidance Office," and incorporating my own opinions, I drafted the following outline of the Shanghai Municipal Homecoming Guidance Office.

Organization

Production Guidance Committee

Prerequisites

It is necessary to unite the leaders of all industries in the city, organize a production guidance committee, and use idle funds to develop production undertakings at the evacuation destination so that evacuees do not lose their jobs.

The number of evacuees and the amount of luggage must be listed in a table, and the supply of transportation vehicles, the protection of residence along the way, and the convenience of various application procedures and inspections must be effectively discussed with the transportation and security authorities. So that the evacuees do not suffer material losses and mental pain.

It is necessary to obtain special rations of daily necessities from the relevant authorities so that they can be provided free of charge and rationed at public prices to the evacuees.

It is necessary to contact the local authorities in advance and establish homecoming reception centers in various places to provide voluntary services and to contact local industrial and commercial circles to arrange the work of evacuees.

The authorities must designate a location with convenient transportation as the address of the office, and the address of the accommodation should be divided into multiple locations, determined by the office according to the situation, mainly using public property.

Expenses

Expenses are divided into three types: government public funds, its own income, and fundraising donations.

### Why Evacuate the Population?

— Gu Nanqun

I have never been good at speaking, and I am even worse at writing articles, so I rarely speak, and even less write articles. This time, the Shen Bao sent a letter requesting an article, so I had no choice but to stand on my own professional position and write a few words:

I am a doctor, and I cannot leave my profession in three sentences, so I have to say a few words about population evacuation based on my own professional experience.

Population evacuation, at this time and in this place, is really too necessary. The trend of the situation is certainly the main reason, but the difficulties in clothing, food, housing, and transportation caused by the war should also be evacuated as soon as possible.

Why? During wartime, everything is subject to considerable restrictions, and clothing, food, housing, and transportation are no exception. The first two points, clothing and transportation, are not discussed much due to space limitations and also because they are outside the scope of what I am familiar with. Here, I will only talk about the two items related to my profession, food and housing, and it should be evacuated quickly.

First, during this period, prices will inevitably gradually skyrocket, and life will become increasingly difficult. Most citizens cannot even obtain enough food and clothing, let alone talk about proper nutrition. Therefore, most people suffer from malnutrition. Malnutrition makes it easy to get sick, so it is better to go to the countryside, which is easier to obtain. This is the first reason why evacuation should be done quickly from the food perspective.

Second is the housing problem. Because part of the city's houses were destroyed in the war and have not been restored to the pre-war scale, the population has increased instead. Therefore, except for a few houses where not many people live, most houses are extremely crowded. In this situation, the air is turbid, and diseases arise. According to the statistics of our Nanyang Hospital, the mortality rate of infectious and acute diseases has been higher in recent years than before, increasing from 2.3% to over 5%. Although it is not necessarily entirely accurate, it can be inferred that the air in the countryside is fresher. Although the sanitation facilities are not complete, it is very rare for so many people to be crammed into a small house, unless they are extremely poor people without even a tile. This is the second reason why evacuation should be done quickly.

Third, we must talk about the destructive power of modern scientific warfare explosives. Everyone knows that modern warfare is very cruel. According to newspapers and magazines, the situation in several major cities in Europe being bombed is simply terrible. Just take what we have heard and seen to report, and it is enough to be shocking. Around May of last year, workers in an iron shop near the former Beile Road in the old Eighth District mistakenly recognized a purchased bomb as an old iron block and exploded it when hitting it. At that time, more than a dozen people were seriously injured and sent to our Nanyang Hospital for treatment. Some were blown open and their flesh was rotten, some had incomplete limbs, and some were scorched all over. Among them, three people died soon due to their serious injuries, and two or three people who were less seriously injured became disabled after being cured. I believe that the citizens of this city will not ignore this situation just because they have not experienced it themselves! But this is only a small bomb. The destructive power of high-altitude bombing, which is more powerful and more frightening than these, is of course even more unimaginable; even its destructive power sometimes exceeds the extent to which our doctors can treat it. This is the third reason why evacuation should be done quickly.

The above three points, as long as we quietly imagine, leaving this city is really too urgent and too necessary. It is certainly impossible to completely avoid the fluctuations of war, but the countryside is safer than the city, which is an undeniable fact. I sincerely advise my compatriots who think it is not necessary to stay in this city, leave this city as soon as possible! An ancient proverb tells us: "In small turmoil, live in the city; in large turmoil, live in the countryside." This is a wise proverb for self-preservation that has been experienced in the bloody lessons of war, and I hope that all citizens of the city will quickly assess the situation and take care of themselves.

### Dongting Mountain as a Discussion Area for Shanghai Citizens to Evacuate

— Xiang Kangyuan

Shanghai's population is too concentrated. Not only is there a need for evacuation in air defense during periods of tense war, but also in terms of the soaring prices of rice roots and fuel, it is necessary to persuade some agencies and households to move to other places to find food. Now the municipal government has organized a committee to handle evacuation matters. I would like to contribute my humble opinions for discussion:

We can deduce that some citizens whose old homes are in neighboring provinces and cities are willing to move back to their old homes; because according to the ordinary situation, the connection between individuals and their family, friends, and assets in their place of origin is generally closer than in other places. If you move back to your old home, everything will be easier. These citizens only need to be assisted by the municipal authorities in terms of transportation, and they can happily go there without any other problems, so it is easier to handle. However, another part of the citizens whose place of origin is in Shanghai, or whose place of origin is very far away and cannot return home, or whose place of origin is in a neighboring area but cannot return due to other difficulties, then the municipal authorities, in addition to solving transportation problems, must also find places to move to for resettlement. Now I propose Dongting West Mountain in Wu County as the evacuation site for these people, and I will elaborate on the reasons and methods as follows:

A. The Environment of Dongting Mountain: Dongting Mountain is under the jurisdiction of Wu County, standing alone in Taihu Lake, with fertile land and beautiful folk customs. Because it is isolated from the mainland, it is not easy for the war to affect it. Not only is it an ideal refuge in wartime, but it is also a beautiful residential area in peacetime. It is rich in fruits, tea, fish, shrimp, and vegetables, and it is not far from the county seat of Wu County, so the supply of food is also very convenient. This mountain and nearby areas are rich in bamboo and wood. If you want to build simple houses to accommodate the people who move there, the materials can be taken locally, which is very easy. The Taihu Lake coast is rich in reeds. Therefore, the daily fuel of the mountain people can be taken infinitely.

The biggest drawback of Dongting Mountain at present is that Han security is not guaranteed. But I think things depend on people. If the immigrants have sufficient financial resources and are well-organized, the bandits on the mountain and in the lake are nothing more than a sore on the foot, and it will not be difficult to eliminate them soon. The British book New Year's Pass in Hong Kong is a good example.

B. The Method of Moving to Dongting Mountain: The Population Evacuation Committee of this city should quickly contact the Wu County Government and the Dongting Mountain Hometown Association in Shanghai, first investigate the houses available for residence in West Mountain, estimate the number of people who can be moved there, and stipulate the amount of fees to be paid per person (the first batch is assumed to be 500,000 yuan per person). Then announce to the citizens that anyone who is willing to evacuate to the mountain should apply for registration at the designated location. Assuming that 100,000 people move to the mountain in the first batch, the Wu County Government will specially form a Dongting Mountain Administration Bureau (or it can be reorganized and expanded by the district office of the mountain) to be responsible for organizing the civil affairs of the mountain. For example, distributing housing, rationing food, ensuring public security, etc., first build the mountain into an area where good people can live and work in peace, and then registered citizens can rest assured to go there and sit back and relax.

At present, it is more difficult to obtain land transportation tools than water transportation; Fortunately, from Shanghai to the mountain, you can hire a dedicated small wheel to tow civilian ships, so the transportation problem is not difficult to solve. Along the way, the tax police regiment should also send armed escorts to ensure safety. After the first batch of 100,000 people goes to the mountain, the second evacuation of citizens will be decided. This will be continued until the population on the mountain reaches the saturation point. But we believe that the amount of fees to be paid by the second and subsequent batches of people going to the mountain should be reduced batch by batch so that those with less power can also enjoy this right. There are also some groups and populations that the municipal government believes must be forcibly moved out of the city, then it is not only possible to evacuate them free of charge, but even to give them subsidies to go to the mountain. This method is tantamount to allowing those with less power to enjoy the light of those with more power, and also to have the opportunity to move to the mountain; only those with more power have a slight priority in the evacuation process.

C. The Civil Affairs of Dongting Mountain: The civil affairs on the mountain should adopt a considerable degree of autonomy. In addition to the Management Bureau, a Civil Affairs Association should be formed by the mountain people to stipulate that certain political contributions should be reviewed and agreed by the Association in advance before they can be implemented; certain facilities should be jointly responsible by the Association to assist the Management Bureau, especially the security guard, in addition to maintaining a strong standing team, the mountain people should actively participate in training and develop self-defense forces, so that the military and civilians can contact each other and respond flexibly, and it is easy to achieve macro effects in defense.

Finance is the driving force behind all undertakings. Opening Dongting West Mountain as a relocation area for Shanghai citizens should be based on the premise of having strong financial resources. Cleaning up bandits, organizing roads, adding new houses, maintaining security guard forces, etc., all require huge expenses before they can be held. The above article proposes that the Shanghai citizens going to the mountain must first pay a fee of 500,000 yuan per person. The total number of 100,000 people in the first batch has reached 50 billion yuan. In addition, the fees paid by subsequent batches of people going to the mountain seem to be very large; but considering the vastness of the expenses required to organize public security, it seems that only this is enough to succeed.

The livelihood problem of Shanghai citizens after moving to the mountain should also be planned in advance. In addition to relying on their own property or relying on remittances from other places, the Management Bureau may as well designate a considerable area of open space to recruit people to rent, so that they can plant fruit trees or vegetables for the mountain's consumption; if the harvest is abundant and the transportation is available, they may as well sell it to other places in exchange for food. In addition, those with special skills, such as those who study medicine, can practice medicine; those who study education can open schools; those who are good at trading can engage in trade between neighboring areas and the mountain, etc. All can do what they can and get what they need.

In short, the plan to open up Dongting Mountain and relocate Shanghai citizens is quite complicated and arduous; but if the government and the people work together and persevere, it is not difficult to promote its realization in the short term. We must not run the mountain as a temporary set for wartime avoidance, but should adhere to the policy of a century-old plan, that is, even after peacetime, we should continue to run it, carry it forward, and create a beautiful residential area in Taihu Lake, which will shine with the Xlangyu, Gulangyu, and Moganshan managed by foreigners, then the manpower and financial resources spent now will not be in vain?
