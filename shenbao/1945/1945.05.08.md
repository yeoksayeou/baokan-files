### Fierce Battles in Southern Okinawa: Japanese Forces Launch Intense Counterattacks, Sinking or Destroying Five Enemy Warships Around the Island

Tokyo, July 7th (Central News Agency dispatch) – In the southern region of Okinawa Island, Japanese ground forces, in response to the intense and continuous attacks by Japanese special attack units against the enemy's mobile forces and fleet around the island, launched fierce counterattacks against the repeatedly assaulting enemy forces. By the morning of the 6th, they had restored their original positions. However, around 2:00 PM that afternoon, the enemy approached the Japanese positions again, and fierce battles ensued. The enemy's main point of attack is currently on the west coast, with the enemy's front line running from Uneko (運接) to Kobatsu (小波津), and the area between Maesato (前地) and Minamikata (南方中間). All Japanese air units are continuing to attack the enemy's northern and central airfields. On the night of the 5th, four fires broke out at each of the northern and central airfields. Furthermore, Japanese special attack units continue to attack the enemy fleet, achieving significant results.

Southern Front, July 7th (Central News Agency dispatch) – Since the start of the land battle on Okinawa Island, Japanese forces have inflicted heavy casualties on the enemy. Initially, the enemy facing the Japanese positions consisted of the 96th Division, the 7th Division, and the 27th Division of the 24th Army. Now, only the 7th Division remains. The others have been replaced by the 77th Division of the 24th Army, which had previously landed on the Kerama Islands and surrounding islands, and the 1st Marine Division from the northern area. The number of enemy aircraft attacking the island was 230 on the 1st, 37 on the 2nd, 190 on the 3rd, 180 on the 4th, 230 on the 5th, and 150 on the 6th, with their attacks being very subdued.

Southwestern Islands Base, July 7th (Central News Agency dispatch) – Japanese air units continue to attack enemy air bases and surrounding enemy warships on Okinawa Island. From the 5th to the 6th, the main targets were seaplane bases, where 25 large fires broke out. In the sea off Kerama, a special-purpose aircraft carrier caught fire and sank, and two other vessels of unknown type caught fire. In addition, four columns of fire could be seen from the land. On the 6th, one vessel of unknown type sank in Kadena Bay, and another was hit by a torpedo.

### Special Attack Planes Achieve Significant Results in Surprise Attack; Aerial Battle Unfolds West of Iheya Island

Forward Base, July 7th (Central News Agency dispatch) – After the Japanese military launched a general air offensive four days ago, a certain aircraft of the Shinbu unit commanded by Second Lieutenant Ina (伊奈) and Second Lieutenant Shima (　島), guided by Second Lieutenant Nakayama (中山), departed from the base at dawn on the 6th. The enemy's air power at the bases has seen fierce battles in the past one or two days. According to Japanese reconnaissance on the 2nd, the northern airfield had six large aircraft and 81 small aircraft, while the central airfield had 60 small aircraft. On the 5th, the northern airfield had only about 40 large and small aircraft, and the central airfield also had fewer small aircraft. The enemy fleet around Okinawa, stationed in Kadena Bay, Nakagusuku Bay, and Itoman Bay, is still deployed in these three locations. Subjected to intense attacks by Japanese special attack units, they are dodging and evading, lacking the aggressiveness they had at the beginning of the operation. Taking advantage of this opportunity, the Japanese special attack units launched an attack on the 6th, dealing a heavy blow to the arrogant enemy. The aircraft of the special attack unit led by Nakayama, using accurate navigation methods to avoid enemy radar detection, successfully executed a surprise attack. At 8:34 AM, the base received a telegram stating that they had arrived over the target. At 9:10:10 AM, they commenced their assault, and it is believed that they achieved significant results.

Japanese Frontline Base, July 7th (Central News Agency dispatch) – During the general offensive launched by the Shinbu unit of the Japanese Army Special Attack Forces on the 4th, the aircraft of Captain Tojo (東條), commander of a certain fighter squadron, and Sergeant Maruko (丸子), of the latest Japanese Army fighter "Hayate" (疾風), which was responsible for providing direct cover, encountered dozens of enemy aircraft in the sea west of Iheya Islands and shot down one and damaged another. After completing their mission, the two returned to base. According to their account, the situation of the special attack aircraft ramming into the enemy was as follows: Their aircraft arrived over the battlefield west of Iheya Island at 0:00 AM on the 4th. Looking down, they saw five enemy battleships and cruisers, and twelve or thirteen destroyers, moving around. A large vessel, resembling a battleship, had two large columns of fire rising from it and was in a state of being unable to navigate. A vessel resembling a destroyer and five others in the vicinity were also ablaze. A blimp was parked in the nearby sea, engaged in rescue operations.

Editorial

### A Voice of Justice

-- In Praise of Foreign Minister Togo's Statement

Japanese Foreign Minister Togo, on the 6th of this month, clarified Japan's solemn attitude towards German diplomacy regarding the situations of Himmler, commander-in-chief of the German domestic army, seeking peace with Britain and the United States, and Marshal Donitz's declaration of continued resistance. This is truly a voice of justice in current international politics.

Regarding the Tripartite Pact between Japan, Germany, and Italy, which was established on December 11, 1941, three days after the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, Article 1 stipulated: "Japan, Germany, and Italy shall pursue the war forced upon them by the United States and Britain with all their strength until victory." Article 2 stipulated: "Japan, Germany, and Italy shall not cease hostilities or make peace with either the United States or Britain without complete mutual understanding." Article 3 stipulated: "The three countries shall also cooperate closely after the completion of the war to establish the just new order stipulated in the Tripartite Pact of September 27, 1940." These three articles clearly stipulate the attitude that Germany should take. However, now that Germany is without Hitler, Himmler, the commander-in-chief of the domestic army, is begging Britain and the United States for surrender. At the same time, Marshal Donitz, after taking office, expressed his intention to continue fighting against the Soviet Union, while only seeking compromise with Britain and the United States to the extent that it does not hinder the war against the Soviet Union. As the head of state, to openly make such a statement, and to act in the same way as Himmler, is in complete violation of the Tripartite Pact between Japan, Germany, and Italy, and is even contrary to Japan's policy of neutrality towards the Soviet Union. Therefore, Foreign Minister Togo cannot but make a solemn statement.

The news of the German authorities violating the Tripartite Pact brings to mind the relationship between Germany and the Soviet Union three years ago. Before the outbreak of the European War, the Soviet Union advocated a collective security system, constantly conducting diplomatic negotiations with Britain, France, and other countries. However, Britain and France lacked sincerity. In order to adapt to the situation at the time, the Soviet Union went on to conclude a treaty with Germany, establishing the German-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact on August 23, 1939. At the time, the whole world was shocked, believing that after cooperation between Germany and the Soviet Union, the old order of imperialism would collapse. At the same time, Germany was also able to smoothly complete the blitzkrieg against European countries thanks to this treaty with the Soviet Union, causing the power of European imperialism to collapse like a house of cards. At that time, the establishment of the Japanese-Soviet Neutrality Pact and the German-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact were important contributing factors. If Germany had not attacked the Soviet Union on June 22, 1941, but had marched westward, then the British Isles could have been taken after Dunkirk, and the United States was still unprepared at the time (this is what the United States admitted), and would certainly have been unable to aid Britain. At that time, with Japan, Germany, Italy, and the Soviet Union leading the overthrow of the old imperialist system and establishing a new world order, it would not have been just an ideal. Unexpectedly, the June 22 war created a major turning point, giving Britain and the United States time to prepare for war at their leisure, leading to the prolongation and expansion of the world war.

Now, unfortunately, Germany has again violated the Tripartite Pact, which is truly regrettable. However, Foreign Minister Togo's timely declaration of a firm stance has refreshed the world's attention. We wholeheartedly support Foreign Minister Togo's statement. First, although Germany has ultimately broken its promise, it has no actual impact on the Japanese government's determination to complete the Greater East Asia Defense War. Second, once Germany's breach of contract has been proven, Japan can obtain freedom of action based on a new perspective to complete the common ideals of Japan and the East Asian nations. We, the entire East Asian nations, will of course, without hesitation, firmly believe, cooperate with the allied nations, and complete the purpose of the Greater East Asia War.

### Japanese Forces in Okinawa Seize Divine Opportunity to Annihilate Enemy; Director Matsushima Speaks at Press Conference

The Mingbang Fleet Press Department stationed in China held a regular press conference at 2:00 PM on the 7th, attended by Director Matsushima and more than ten reporters from various newspapers. Director Matsushima reported on the Pacific War situation, the European war situation, and the crisis of the San Francisco Conference. The main points of his speech are recorded as follows:

### Enemy Losses of 250,000 Men

Since the beginning of May, fierce battles have unfolded on Okinawa Island. From May 4th, the Japanese army, with a new posture, launched a fierce offensive from land, sea, and air. The enemy, starting from the west, launched an attack with the 27th, 96th, and 73rd Divisions against the Naha and Naha area. However, the 96th Division in the middle has been annihilated. The enemy then transferred the 6th Naval Division and the 77th Army Division from the north to join the 96th Division in battle, but suffered serious blows. As of May 2nd, the enemy's land losses, according to their own announcement, were over 14,000. At the same time, the losses from attacks on the Japanese mainland and operations around Okinawa Island were 11,413 men. The total number of losses announced by the enemy is over 25,000 men. Based on past enemy propaganda, we can use one-tenth as a calculation standard. Therefore, the enemy's losses this time are at least over 250,000 men. With the attacks by the Japanese Army, Navy, Air Force, and Special Attack Forces, as of May 2nd, the enemy had a total of 520 warships sunk or damaged.

### Enemy Forces in Okinawa Attacked from Front and Rear

There are also situations that were not only seen on Iwo Jima and Saipan, which are according to the enemy's May 4th announcement. Three thousand Japanese soldiers, with twenty tanks, landed from the east and west sides on the night of the 4th and began a frontal assault on the enemy's 96th and 77th Divisions. With the enemy forces being attacked from the front and rear, the enemy claimed that they had repelled the Japanese forces behind them on the morning of the 5th. The enemy warships around Okinawa Island are constantly being damaged and reduced in number. As of May 6th, the enemy warships remaining in that area only include two special aircraft carriers, four battleships, and ten cruisers. Under the attack of this fleet, columns of fire occur continuously, that is, the enemy warships are constantly being damaged. The Japanese Air Force has also inflicted considerable damage on the enemy's air power at the east, central and west airfields near the central two coasts. The number of enemy aircraft attacking the Okinawa battlefield has been decreasing compared to previous totals. Previously, there were often around 500 aircraft, but as of May 6th, it has been reduced to 80 aircraft. The Japanese side now has a solid grasp of the initiative in the Okinawa operation. Whether it is air superiority or the divine opportunity to annihilate the enemy, it is in the hands of the Japanese army. Therefore, the more intense the Japanese military's attack, the closer the day will be for the annihilation of the enemy on Okinawa Island. Okinawa Island has a kind of venomous snake called "Habu", which is extremely poisonous, and many enemy soldiers are victims of it. Previously, during the Japanese rule of Kagoshima, about 10,000 Japanese people were injured each year. This venomous snake can enter the ground and climb trees, just like the Japanese mainland ground forces and air force, and is giving the enemy unbearable suffering.

### Two Routes of German Forces Continue to Resist

On the European front, since the heroic death of Hitler, the enemy has been propagating that the German army has surrendered. Based on our judgment, it is not yet at this point. General Donitz is in the north of the German army, and General Kesselring is in the south. They are currently engaged in fierce battles on the southwest border of Czechoslovakia. There are still more than 25 divisions of the German army in the southwest border of Czechoslovakia. According to enemy propaganda, they can also resist for more than three weeks. What is particularly noteworthy is that the British and American forces have one million troops on both sides of the Elbe River, and the Soviet army has four million troops. This uneven distribution of forces, regardless of any political conditions, will definitely form a strategic problem. It is absolutely impossible to immediately transfer the forces to the east. If the German army completely stops fighting, the question of how many British and American troops will be transferred to the Pacific is very problematic, that is, the time to realize this is still in the distant future.

### US-Soviet Relations Become Increasingly Tense

At the San Francisco Conference, US Secretary of State Stettinius had a head-on clash with Molotov over the Polish issue, and the US-Soviet conflict has expanded. According to Stettinius's broadcast on May 5th, sixteen key figures of the Polish government-in-exile were arrested in Moscow. The reasons for this should be clearly explained first. Stettinius used this to agitate Molotov. This issue not only shows that the dark clouds over the future of the San Francisco Conference are thick, but also intensifies US-Soviet relations.

The European food problem is extremely serious, and its severity is far greater than the surrender of the German army. According to a statement issued on May 4th by Mr. Fowler, Director of the US Foreign Economic Administration, 200 to 300 million people in Europe must be provided with food to maintain their survival, but this food can only support them for three months. The United States is transporting food to Europe from the US mainland, Australia, and Canada to supplement the food supply. Important supplies are limited to the US military and the military and civilians of its allies, but German citizens are excluded. This issue will develop into a famine front and become a serious social problem, which may also lead to a third world war.

### US Troops Enter Czechoslovakia and Occupy Pilsen

Stockholm, Sweden, July 7th (Central News Agency dispatch) – In the past 24 hours, Prague and Copenhagen, the two major European capitals, have been the focus of attention in the European War. It is reported that in Prague, negotiations are underway with the German army to peacefully hand over its administrative power to the Czech government, and hostilities have now ceased. Czech underground activists suddenly launched an uprising, and the German army took swift action. The Czech radio station urgently called for Allied assistance, and Patton's Third Army, which was rushing to the rescue, passed through the Little Maginot Line on the western border of Czechoslovakia and penetrated 37 kilometers into Czechoslovakian territory. It is also reported that US troops have occupied Pilsen (an important city in the Czech military-industrial complex) and advanced 20 kilometers towards Prague. Fighting has also broken out in Copenhagen, but uniformed Danes have begun to search for pro-German elements on the orders of the new government. 175 British troops landed by air at noon and entered the city, only to encounter slight resistance from the German army. When the crowd attempted to invade German warships docked in the port, the German warships opened fire. The fighting around the Royal Palace was particularly fierce, and the roof tiles of the palace were damaged by artillery fire. The German Ambassador to Denmark, Mr. Best, has also been arrested by the Danish Freedom Council.

In the 4th edition of our agency's report on the 5th, "Japanese Forces Vigorously Attack Ryukyu Enemy Warships," in the section on the results achieved by the Japanese special attack forces and air force around Okinawa, the phrase "destroyed or damaged three cruisers or destroyers" was missing the four characters "one battleship" after "destroyed". This is hereby corrected.

### Denmark and Italy Request to Participate in the San Francisco Conference

Lisbon, 7th (Central News Agency dispatch) - The participating countries in the San Francisco Conference have reached 49.

According to a dispatch from San Francisco: the representatives of the United States and Britain are showing reluctance on this matter.

### Future Domestic Problems in the United States

Shortly before the San Francisco Conference, Roosevelt suddenly passed away from a cerebral hemorrhage. His position in American politics and diplomacy was extremely important, and his influence was undeniably strong, profound, and far-reaching. The depth of his influence varied internally and externally, and its manifestation would take some time. Roosevelt's indelible achievement in American history was "national unity," something that had been desired but never achieved since the Civil War, or rather, since the founding of the United States. The meaning of the term "United States" also illustrates this. Based on this foundation, Roosevelt's footsteps in American diplomacy can be summarized into two points: thoroughly strengthening the interventionist Eastern Asia policy hidden under the guise of Open Door Policy and equal opportunity, and fundamentally overturning the traditional isolationist policy toward Europe. This can be said to be the policy demanded by American capitalism, which constantly pursues markets and profits. Although the path taken by the United States may be tortuous due to the different personalities of its leaders, its general direction is unrelated to whether Roosevelt is alive or not, because it has already been determined.

After the Manchurian Incident, Hoover was defeated in the 1932 presidential election, and when Stimson, known for his non-recognition policy, was rumored to be about to change his diplomatic approach to Japan, Roosevelt suddenly took the stage and held a long consultation with Stimson. As a result, he declared his intention to fully follow Stimson's policies. This shows that the policy toward Japan demanded by American capitalism is the same whether it is under the Democratic Party or the Republican Party. This fact was not only revealed by the Manchurian Incident. It had already appeared at the end of Wilson's term, after World War I, which can be called the pinnacle of isolationism, when the US Senate refused to ratify the Treaty of Versailles. One of the focal points of the US Senate's opposition to the treaty was the Shandong issue. Because Wilson made concessions to Japan at the peace conference, the US Senate refused to ratify the treaty.

### The Collapse of Isolationism

In short, interventionist diplomacy and aggressive diplomacy are the traditions of the United States' Pacific policy, but it would be impossible to develop this into a military war without overthrowing isolationism in its relations with Europe. From the standpoint of American imperialism, Roosevelt made a huge contribution to the success of this matter. When capital hopes to extend beyond national borders to the world, that is, when it inevitably takes on internationalism economically, it can no longer cling to isolationism politically. Therefore, the collapse of isolationism, although dependent on Roosevelt's efforts, was always the path demanded by American capitalism.

However, it is undeniable that Roosevelt's personality played a major role in relations with Britain and the Soviet Union. For example, with regards to American-Soviet relations, it was Roosevelt who acknowledged the Soviet Union despite the rampant domestic opposition. During last year's presidential election, the Kremlin also openly supported him. Although it is impossible to easily predict what American-Soviet relations will be like after Roosevelt's death, what is particularly subtle is: won't the domestic situation in the United States affect American-Soviet relations?

### The Results of the New Deal

Roosevelt's domestic policy can truly be regarded as a progressive measure, that is, determining that unemployment is the responsibility of society as a whole. This overturned the Puritan tradition of viewing unemployment as the result of individual laziness, and Roosevelt implemented a series of policies called the "New Deal" based on this new social view. The main reason he was able to break American tradition and be elected four times was not so-called vote-buying or a Jewish conspiracy, but the result of the working masses supporting the new policies. This may have to be frankly admitted. But here, too, there are grounds for opposition from the capitalists.

In last year's election, Vice President Wallace resigned and Truman was selected instead, in an attempt to alleviate the opposition of the financial community to the New Deal. If Roosevelt had foreseen that he would die today, he would have tried his best to keep Wallace, who was brave and loyal to the New Deal. Now, Truman, who has close ties to the financial community, has assumed the presidency in accordance with the constitution. In terms of cabinet members, the New Deal faction is in a lonely and declining state. This is where the biggest problem for the United States in the future lies.

That is, under the New Deal, Roosevelt, in order to check the financial magnates of Wall Street and to facilitate gaining the support of the masses, worked hard to promote liberalism. As a result, labor unions developed rapidly, and they became like enemy countries to the government, parliament, and the financial community. At this point, the problem arises. Under the banner of liberalism fostered by the New Deal, the working masses began to consider what democracy should be like. The world trend of the People's Front, especially the rise of pro-Soviet enthusiasm among the masses after the outbreak of the German-Soviet war, further promoted this trend.

### Where will Truman Go?

After Roosevelt's death, how will the Truman cabinet, which has a strong financial flavor, lead these masses? Today, the United States is in a state of national frenzy, pursuing the dream of victory and igniting hatred for people of color. Perhaps there will be no difficulties in this wartime excitement. However, when it comes to post-war issues, or with the progress of Soviet work in the United States, how will the two conflicting classes in the United States react? This is a future problem and the most subtle thing. (Kyozo Mori, former New York correspondent for Asahi Shimbun) (Translated from the April 14th Asahi Shimbun)

### Gold Securities Reserve Fund Designated for Special Custody, Banks and Citizens Enthusiastically Purchase Securities

After the issuance of gold securities on the 7th, banks and the general public went to purchase them with great enthusiasm. It is heard that after issuing the gold securities on the 7th, 8th, and 9th, the Central Reserve Bank will deliver the same amount of gold reserve in full to the Issuance Reserve Fund Management Committee for safekeeping, in accordance with the total amount issued during these three days, for redemption upon maturity. The Management Committee will establish a special vault to store the gold, clarifying management responsibilities. It is also heard that it is planned to designate the treasury of the United Bank Preparatory Committee as the special vault for storing the reserve fund.

Economic Circle's Thoughts

The gold securities issued by the Central Reserve Bank have been listed for sale from the 7th to the 9th, according to the recently published price of 780,000 per tael. Yesterday, a Central News Agency reporter visited a prominent figure in the economic circle and asked about his feelings regarding the Central Reserve Bank's issuance of gold securities. He said that Shanghai has been flooded with floating capital in the past two years, which has failed to find its way into proper investment channels, and has instead been used to purchase and hoard materials. Part of the capital that has flowed into the rural areas of the interior has been unable to flow back to Shanghai because farmers in the interior cannot purchase suitable commodities in Shanghai. Therefore, Shanghai has suffered from the evil trend of hoarding materials, causing prices to continue to rise, the cost of goods to increase, and the turnover of funds to feel increasingly insufficient. Although the Central Reserve Bank has tried its best to adjust funds and increase currency chips, the demand is still difficult to meet, and speculative phenomena have emerged. In addition, the evolution of the situation has affected the entire financial instability. The Central Reserve Bank's issuance of gold securities, with the main purpose of maintaining the value of currency, tightening currency, suppressing prices, and enhancing wartime economic strength, is a timely and good policy. Since the gold securities have full reserves and the public is allowed to freely trade gold securities, it is a new investment avenue for general asset holders, and it should be supported by all sectors of society, finance, and industry. The market situation on the 7th became more stable. Not only did the stock market tend to stabilize, but also the prices of various goods tended to decrease.

### Shanghai Municipal Transportation Company

— Jia Xi

—An Analysis of Shanghai's Public Utilities, Part Two—

Numerous Types of Punishments

The company has many punishment methods, with the main ones being as follows:

Dismissal: Dismissal is considered the most severe punishment in factory administration! However, serving in the tram company carries the risk of dismissal for even the slightest matter. Sometimes, hundreds of people are dismissed at once, mostly for "skimming." After the war, tram routes shortened, and the number of passengers surged. Often, passengers on short trips would get off without paying, or they couldn't buy tickets because it was too crowded. These were considered "missed fares," intentional "skimming," and could result in dismissal. There were also cases of ticket sellers being suspended for "skimming" and, in anger, throwing themselves into the Huangpu River.

Fines: Ticket sellers are fined almost every month, while drivers and workers in other departments are fined less often. To reduce punishment, some secretly pay to avoid consequences.

Demotion: If a worker commits a fault in service, such as skimming, missing fares, issuing wrong tickets, or having conflicts with passengers, the company will demote them for a few days, forbidding them from working. In addition to not receiving wages, they must wait at the company until assigned a shift again. The demotion period ranges from three or four days to ten or more days. Workers at the company call this punishment "office putting down the hat" because they are not allowed to work without a hat.

Rice Deduction: Since the introduction of rationed rice, this punishment has been added. If ticket sellers skim, miss fares, issue wrong tickets, or if inspectors let people on the tram without tickets, their rice ration for the month is suspended. To keep their rice, inspectors and ticket sellers must work diligently.

These four forms of punishment have no regulations or limits. The type of punishment received depends entirely on "luck." In the mechanical department, suspensions and fines are less common, but the workload is heavier.

Working Hours for Internal and External Staff

Previously, workers in the transportation department worked about nine hours a day, divided into morning, afternoon, and night shifts, or sometimes just morning and evening shifts. After trams switched to early morning and late evening services, workers still only worked one shift a day. However, from April 1st of this year, they switched to full-day work. Trams on routes 2 and 5 (trolley) and 21, 16, and 24 (trackless) depart from the Hart Road depot. Routes 7, 8, and 1 depart from the Huishan Wharf. Usually, they depart at 6:00 AM and return to the depot at 11:00 AM, then depart again at 3:00 PM and return around 8:00 PM. On Sundays, they depart at 6:45 AM, stop at 12:00 PM, reopen at 2:00 PM, and stop at 8:00 PM. Recently, routes 2 and 7 have also switched to full-day service. On the surface, it seems that workers in the transportation department work more than ten hours a day, but in reality, it's twelve or even thirteen hours. Because of the preparation for being sent to the work location and the time lost traveling back and forth to change shifts, an average of more than two hours is lost each day. For example, if the early shift starts at 6:00 AM at Hart Road or Jing'an Temple, Huishan Wharf, starting from the company (because they have to go to the company to punch in), it takes almost 30 minutes to get to the destination, so the person taking over the shift has to arrive at the destination before 6:00 AM, meaning they have to prepare to leave around 5:00 AM. They finish at 11:00 AM, then take over again at 3:00 PM until 8:00 PM. By this calculation, the time lost going back and forth each day is more than two and a half hours. On Sundays, the tram stops at 12:00 PM and reopens at 2:00 PM. Because too much time is spent traveling back and forth, there is practically no time to eat. On the other hand, if a driver or ticket seller is a few minutes late, they not only can't get on the tram that day, but they are also fined. Therefore, starting work at 6:00 AM is tantamount to fulfilling their duties at 5:15 AM. Furthermore, after the ticket seller finishes their shift, they must balance the accounts, hand in the money, receive tickets, and match tickets. Drivers must also inspect the vehicles, losing about 45 minutes. External affairs officers, such as ticket inspectors and dispatchers, must also prepare reports, which takes another 30 to 45 minutes. Moreover, if the tram is behind schedule or doesn't arrive at the station on time, they will be heavily fined. Now that the routes are short, there are fewer trams, and passengers are crowded, the tram moves slower, and the ticket seller's job is even more intense, increasing the workload. The mechanical department's work is fixed at nine hours per day, divided into day shifts, which is more regulated than the transportation department. When work is busy, it is temporarily extended by one or two hours to three or four hours, and wages are paid hourly. The same is true for mechanics in the workshop. Accountants in the general accounting office and banknote managers all work nine hours, while senior staff in other departments work about six or seven hours.

General Living Conditions of Employees

The problem of ticket sellers "skimming" is mostly driven by the pressure of life. New ticket sellers often make mistakes due to unfamiliarity, resulting in missed fares and fines. Therefore, ticket sellers often receive less than half their wages at the time of payment. The only way to compensate is through fraud. In recent years, the company has seriously cracked down on the issue of ticket seller fraud and has established ticket booths. Passengers must purchase tickets in advance before lining up to board the tram. At the same time, a lottery is held to reward passengers for keeping their tickets and preventing them from falling into the hands of ticket sellers. Therefore, skimming is now rare.

Dismissal, fines, demotion, and rice deduction are common occurrences. After numerous deductions, they are left in a state of semi-unemployment and semi-starvation, making it difficult to maintain their personal lives. It is even more unimaginable for those with family burdens. A worker has to support several people, and the wife and two or three children are often unable to work. Recently, many employees have sent their families back to their hometowns and are living alone in Shanghai. The company has very few cultural and educational facilities, such as worker's night schools or schools for workers' children. Due to poor nutrition and unsanitary living conditions, disease or infectious diseases are more likely to threaten them.

Workers' marriages are mostly based on arranged marriages and parental decisions. Their spouses are mostly from the same hometown, and there are also quite a few who live together after being introduced by friends. Hobbies: Gambling is the most common. Prostitution has recently become popular again because their families have returned to their hometowns. More than twenty people at the old station smoke opium. The saying that "workers at the new station are hooligans" is actually just a joke; only a very small number of people are like that. Socializing is a legitimate form of entertainment in advanced countries, but here it is used as a means to solve living problems. Their expenses on social obligations are also quite high each month.

The company has more than three thousand workers, but it doesn't have its own hospital, club, library, educational institution, school for workers' children, or sports field. Therefore, visiting the Great World amusement park, going to the company, and watching grand operas or movies with institutional backdrops have become the highlights of their monotonous lives. Some ambitious people also like to box, watch plays, and read books and newspapers. Mechanics have weekly days off, while transportation workers have rotating days off. Most workers like to sleep on their days off or during their spare time, which is the inevitable result of extreme fatigue. (The End)

### Urging Citizens to Cooperate in Completing the Mission of Self-Police and Self-Defense: Director Gu of the Baojia Office's Broadcast Speech Yesterday

Gu Jiwu, the Director of the Baojia Office of the Shanghai Police Bureau, broadcast to the entire city's public on the evening of the seventh at 9:30 PM via Shanghai Radio Station. He explained a great deal about the Baojia work in the city, and his speech is recorded as follows:

A Miracle in Municipal History

Everyone is a citizen who has lived in Shanghai for many years and is most familiar with the living environment here, which, generally speaking, is complex and deformed. Of course, this situation was not formed overnight, but we want to establish an organized and disciplined Baojia system in such an environment. No one can deny that this is an arduous task.

When the Baojia was first established, some people said that the Shanghai Baojia could not be implemented. However, over the past few years, with the enthusiastic cooperation of citizens and local elders, it has already reached some scale, and the result of fighting with the surrounding environment has achieved some success. This may be said to be a miracle in Shanghai's municipal history.

Emphasizing Practice, Not Empty Talk

I understand that Baojia is a difficult task, but because I was entrusted by the authorities and because of my personal interest, I resolutely undertook this task with many comrades. However, our Baojia Office is only a subordinate department of the Municipal Police Bureau, that is, the liaison and transfer agency between the government and the people, and the leading agency for Baojia affairs. I am like a leading coachman and a border guard. Regardless of how far the Baojia work can be promoted and how much contribution it can make to the country, I will just do it with the purpose of not counting success or failure, and bearing in mind the purpose. I have a concept for serving the Baojia, which is to practice more than empty talk, to value the real training of the people, to cultivate outstanding talents, to serve the local area, to promote a perfect Baojia system, and to dedicate it to the rejuvenation of the country and the nation, and to share the responsibility of defending East Asia. Therefore, one more point of effort we give is one more point of contribution.

Time and Space Are Not Limited

Secondly, I think that Baojia work is not limited by time or space. The hearts of Chinese and foreign people who seek a peaceful and happy life are the same. In the current complex environment, the only way to seek a peaceful and happy life is to start with the Baojia work of self-policing and self-defense. Therefore, we only ask whether it is in line with the principles of people's autonomy and self-defense and whether it should be done. After obtaining real confirmation, we will do it with a spirit of fearlessness, and success, failure, praise, and slander are not considered. At the same time, the Baojia Office is the central agency for promoting the Baojia system in the urban area. I am in charge of the Baojia Office, and in fact, I bear the heavy responsibility of promoting the Baojia. Therefore, I am obliged to plan and promote Baojia work, to cooperate in maintaining neighborhood security, and to relieve the suffering of the people, and I must do my best. However, things in society often lead to bad speculation because they are too responsible and too devoted. However, I only ask that the Baojia work progresses day by day so that the people can get real benefits, and I will never have other thoughts. In other words, I only seek peace of mind.

Striving for Soundness in Expenditure and Income

Regarding the Baojia's funding issue, we have spent a lot of effort to create a sound method. On the income side, we issue corresponding fee-paying stamps to the special households, shop corpses, regular households, and attached households reported by each district. Therefore, there are accurate statistics on how much funding should be received in the entire district, and each district committee affixes the corresponding stamps when collecting fees from each household as proof. On the expenditure side, in addition to allocating 20% to the urban Baojia Committee for overall facilities, all are autonomous by each district. Because each district's committee is composed of local gentry and elders as committee members, and the branch director also participates directly, there is absolutely no corruption. It can be said that it is taken from the people and used for the people, which is very reassuring to us.

Further Cooperating with Municipal Administration

Recently, due to the appointment of Mayor Wu and the appointment of Secretary-General Luo as the chairman of the Urban Baojia Committee, the Baojia work has been epoch-makingly refreshed. In the future, we will further assist in promoting municipal administration, such as in public health. We hope that citizens will, in the spirit of Baojia, automatically cooperate with the health authorities to clean up the city and use the Baojia mechanism to widely prevent epidemics in order to eliminate epidemics that endanger citizens. In the future, the citizen's rationing system will be based on the Baojia district as the rationing district, with precise statistics, so that every citizen can get the due rationing items, and there will be no corruption.

The current situation is urgent, and evacuating the population is the top priority. In addition to actively assisting in the promotion of the Baojia Office, I hope that citizens and women and children who do not need to stay in this city will register with their respective general joint Bao. We will try our best to help with transportation so that they can return home.

Regarding the importance of air defense, I think all citizens have fully understood. The Baojia is standing on the front line of air defense. I hope that citizens will always pay attention to fire control and all air defense measures and not treat life as a child's play.

The promotion of the Baojia system has been in place for several years. To date, we have not been able to reach the ideal state of affairs that you all have. Although due to personnel constraints and restrictions on laws and regulations, we have to unite the people, train the people, achieve the rejuvenation of the country and the nation, and then share the responsibility of defending East Asia, we must continue to work hard and bury ourselves in hard work. We hope that citizens will assist us with enthusiasm and fight together to complete our mission of self-policing and self-defense.

### Shanghai You You Nursery's Sixth Recruitment Campaign

The Shanghai You You Nursery currently houses 150 orphans. Due to the difficulty of food supply in Shanghai, it was moved to Xu Gong Bridge in Anting in mid-March. It has more than 40 acres of farmland and several thatched houses, and it is implementing a farming and reading education to complete a self-sufficient production plan. However, with a large population, it is not easy to maintain. Therefore, the sixth recruitment campaign was launched with a target of 10 million yuan. Yesterday afternoon, Director Lin Kanghou and Chairman Zhang Wenkui invited philanthropists from all walks of life to discuss the recruitment at the YMCA. More than 20 people attended, including Wen Lanting, Lu Zhixue, Tan Tiankai, Xu Zhichao, Dong Hao, and Huang Jingwan. Zhang Jusheng reported on the hospital's affairs, and Zhu Lianxiang reported on the finances. They all agreed that rescuing orphans and giving them appropriate education is a top priority today. They hope that charitable people in society will give sympathy, enthusiastically help, and jointly support this righteous cause so that the goal of 10 million yuan can be achieved as soon as possible. It is what we hope for. On the spot, Mr. Zhang Chunyan generously donated 3 million yuan, and the rest of the people pledged to donate 2 million yuan.

### Mr. Xue Fengyuan Generously Donates Righteous School Funds

Mr. Xue Fengyuan, the current Deputy Secretary-General of the Executive Yuan, is extremely enthusiastic about culture and education. He has assisted greatly in the editing of this newspaper's yearbook. Now, he has donated 15,000 yuan to this newspaper's "Righteous School Funds" to promote it. His enthusiasm is admirable. We would like to thank him on behalf of the poor students.
