### Enemy Ships off Okinawa Heavily Damaged; 21 Other Ships Damaged by Hurricane

Central News Agency dispatch from a Frontline Base, 14th: Japanese air forces attacked enemy ships off Okinawa Island and nearby waters at dawn on the 14th, inflicting heavy damage.

Central News Agency dispatch from Lisbon, 14th: A dispatch from Da Fao Island states that the Nimitz Command announced the following on the 13th: On June 5th, the U.S. Third Fleet, between the Philippines and Okinawa, suffered damage to 21 ships due to a violent hurricane. These included the new battleship "Alabama," the "Indiana," the "Massachusetts," and five aircraft carriers such as the "Essex." The cruiser "Pittsburgh" lost 100 feet of its bow to the waves and is currently undergoing intensive repairs. Other damaged ships are still participating in operations. The hurricane's speed was said to be 166 to 220 nautical miles per hour.

### Mobile Unit Attack; Extremely Poor Skill

Proving the Enemy Suffered Heavy Losses in the Okinawa Battle

Central News Agency dispatch from a Frontline Aviation Base, 14th: The enemy mobile unit, which suffered a disastrous defeat in the Okinawa battle and retreated to rear bases in the Leyte and Ulithi areas, reorganized its forces shortly after. On the morning of the 10th, it approached the Japanese mainland and launched carrier-based aircraft to attack aviation bases in the Kanto region. This mobile unit was composed primarily of the surviving escort carriers "Lexington II" and "Essex," "Independence," etc., mixed with converted carriers. However, the poor skill of their attacks was unprecedented, a concrete proof that the enemy mobile unit had been heavily struck by the Japanese forces and suffered excessive damage. Their aviation skills were also extremely poor; a large formation of 1,200 aircraft was only barely able to put on a show. Their low level of skill was exactly the same as that of the combat-bomber combined units taking off from the Okinawa base. This proves that the enemy mobile unit and naval forces in the Okinawa operation have suffered heavy losses. During the Okinawa operation, enemy aircraft repeatedly experienced forced landings due to engine problems. This shows that the enemy army, which prides itself on abundant supplies, is in an inescapable predicament in the Okinawa operation.

### Squad Leader Shimada; Discusses Mainland Landing Battle; Psychological Contradictions on the Chongqing Side

Lieutenant Colonel Shimada, head of the Shanghai Japanese Army Press Unit, answered questions from reporters from various newspapers in this city on the "exaggerated propaganda of the enemy U.S. regarding a mainland landing battle" at the regular press conference yesterday (14th) morning. Squad Leader Shimada expressed his views as follows:

The enemy will transfer troops from Europe to East Asia. In terms of air force and army strength, the air force can move faster, while the army will take considerable time. The earliest a landing could be realized is after October of this year. The possibility of the enemy gathering forces in the Pacific and landing on the Chinese mainland depends on the scale of the landing. If the enemy dares to land on the mainland, it must have a huge force. Currently, the enemy's tactics are still focused on large-scale bombing of the Japanese mainland, destroying small and medium-sized cities and transportation lines. In the event the enemy lands on the mainland, the southeastern coast, such as Guangdong and Fujian, is more likely.

Recently, Chiang Kai-shek mentioned the landing of U.S. troops on the Chinese mainland in three speeches, claiming that the Chongqing army's self-reliant general counter-offensive must be actively supported by the United States with military and economic assistance, which he is confident can be achieved. He shows reluctance to see the realization of the U.S. military's landing, but at the same time hopes for U.S. assistance. The contradictions in his psychology are obvious.

### Fierce Fighting Continues Around Balikpapan; Enemy Troops on Ternate Island Surrounded

Currently, fierce fighting continues in the Balikpapan hilly area and along the line connecting the second airfield on the Samarinda highway. The Japanese army has made a slight strategic retreat. The enemy has invaded the first airfield. The results achieved by the Japanese army in this land and sea battle are as follows: four enemy large destroyers sunk, six minesweepers sunk, two transport ships sunk, three landing craft sunk, fifteen aircraft shot down, and 2,200 enemy soldiers annihilated.

Central News Agency dispatch from a Southwest Pacific Base, 14th: The Japanese army is surrounding and pressuring the enemy troops who landed north of Ternate Island, further tightening the encirclement on the 12th, annihilating over 300 enemy soldiers and inflicting heavy damage.

### Suzhou-Shanghai Highway; Being Actively Constructed

Central News Agency dispatch from Suzhou, 14th: The Suzhou-Shanghai Highway has been progressing smoothly since the Suzhou and Shanghai provincial and municipal authorities began construction. All bridge and road surface engineering will be completed gradually. It is learned that the provincial government, in order to celebrate wartime achievements and facilitate wartime transportation, has instructed relevant authorities to expedite the repair of the Suzhou-Shanghai-Kunshan-Taicang-Qingpu-Anzhen highways. In addition, the load-bearing capacity of all bridge signs will be uniformly increased from 6 metric tons to 11 metric tons to meet needs. To gather collective wisdom, a meeting of relevant authorities was convened yesterday at the Construction Department. First, Director Sun of the Construction Department reported in detail: the situation of repairing various highways, the strengthening of automobile control, the collection of road maintenance fees, the maintenance of provincial highways, the recent work status of the Construction and General Engineering Office, and the adaptation of wartime measures and cooperation in various new construction plans during wartime. After discussion, key points were decided. In addition to the Suzhou-Shanghai and Kunshan-Taicang roads, which will still be handled by the Construction General Engineering Office, projects such as the Qingpu-Anzhen Road will be handled by the respective county governments. It is reported that the Construction General Engineering Office has been working overnight since receiving the order, and has already drafted a detailed plan, which has been submitted to the province for approval. Construction will begin soon, with the goal of completing it in the shortest possible time to facilitate transportation. This will be a long-term benefit, leaving a brilliant legacy for Jiangsu's construction, cooperating in the war, and adapting to wartime measures. Great expectations are placed on all parties.

### Ministry of Finance Report; Recent Policy Overview; Measures Taken to Stabilize Shanghai's Financial Situation

Central News Agency dispatch from Nanjing, 14th: Vice Minister Chen Zhishuo of the Ministry of Finance met with Chinese and Japanese journalists in Nanjing at 10:00 AM on the 14th in the Ministry of Finance conference room and announced the following regarding the Ministry's recent policy overview:

In terms of finance, recently, due to the lack of cash in the market, allocation notes have emerged in Shanghai. The disadvantages are evident: discounting is prevalent, stimulating price increases and having a significant impact. In light of this, the Ministry of Finance has ordered the cessation of allocation notes' circulation and replaced them with bank drafts. However, a few banks are still issuing promissory notes excessively, causing volatility in prices in Shanghai. Recently, the Ministry has instructed the Central Reserve Bank's Financial Affairs Inspection Office to revoke the licenses or severely punish some illegal banks based on the inspection results. It is believed this will stabilize prices in Shanghai to some extent.

Regarding salt affairs adjustment, future policies for the Salt Affairs Office will focus on adapting to reality. The former Zhonghua and Yuhua companies have been dissolved. In the future, the two parties' transportation and sales will adopt a unified system, contract out to merchants by region, and unify transportation and sales matters. The government will assist from the sidelines. The contracting work ended on June 18th and the progress is very good, with very enthusiastic investment from all parties. From July 1st, the salt tax will be increased to 3,000 yuan per dan.

Regarding the issue of civil servant compensation, the increase in civil servant salaries for the second half of the year was approved at the 74th National Defense Conference on the 12th, deciding to increase it to secure their livelihoods. The large rice ration system will also continue to be maintained.

Regarding the issue of salary rice procurement, approximately 60,000 dan of rice is needed each month for civil servants and military police salaries. At a time when rice procurement is difficult, it is not easy to secure this amount each month. In addition to discussing procurement methods with relevant parties, a meeting of local financial authorities will be convened within the next few days to plan to collect real goods on behalf of the central government from the local real goods collection system in various provinces and cities to supplement the source of salary rice.

Weekly Review

### On Bank Drafts and Increased Currency Issuance

— Shi Zhen

Recently, the proliferation of bank drafts in the market has been like carps crossing the river. At the same time, although the Central Bank has been trying its best to ease the cash position of banks and financial institutions, the amount of deposits that depositors can withdraw is only slightly more than before and still cannot meet legitimate needs. The first impact of the excessive issuance of bank drafts is rising prices. At the same time, when depositors need cash in excess of the amount they can withdraw, they have to discount it on the black market. In other words, it increases the unnecessary burden and suffering of the people. The authorities prohibit promissory notes but allow the issuance of bank drafts, which, in addition to creating a superior position for banks and financial institutions, can be said to have further increased the unnecessary suffering and loss of the people. Banks issue bank drafts originally to meet the needs of customers, facilitate cash payments, and make it easy to carry. However, today, banks and financial institutions issue drafts not only without being prompted by customer requests, but also with the intention of forcing customers to accept them. The only excuse is the shortage of cash, and the resulting bad consequences are credit inflation and rising prices. An analysis follows:

The Credit Issue of Bank Drafts: When banks issue drafts to replace cash, it has already caused prices to rise. However, promissory notes have the backing of the Central Reserve and the two monetary preparation associations. With sufficient reserves, they still cannot be compared with cash. Moreover, the quality of banks and financial institutions in Shanghai varies. Among them, there are some who operate with speculation as their business. A few bad apples are enough to harm the whole group. Therefore, in terms of the credit of bank drafts, they are inferior to promissory notes and there is a real need for restrictions. This is the first point.

The Issuance Issue of Bank Drafts: Promissory notes must go through exchange procedures and check the cash position before issuance, so there are still concerns when they are issued. However, it is an undeniable fact that the recent thirty-five banks and financial institutions have taken advantage of their position to excessively issue promissory notes. Moreover, since the issuance of bank drafts does not go through exchange procedures, there is no need to check the cash position. Under the guise of "withdrawal within ten days," there is no lack of daring and reckless issuance without any scruples. Therefore, since July 3rd, the cash position of banks has been tight, and prices of goods, stocks, gold, etc., have only risen and not fallen, which is not unrelated to the proliferation of bank drafts. It is detrimental to the people's livelihood and of no benefit, and there is a real need for restrictions. This is the second point.

The Forgery Issue of Bank Drafts: Forgery of bank drafts will inevitably cause people to suffer losses. Banks can easily detect forgery and return the drafts, but stores and individuals, except for tracing the original owner, have to recognize the loss themselves. The forgery that occurred with promissory notes in the past will definitely not disappear with the use of bank drafts, but will intensify, so there is an even greater need for restrictions. This is the third point.

Therefore, the issuance of bank drafts by banks may be beneficial to the banks themselves, but it is of no benefit to the country and the people. Currently, some banks issue bank drafts, which is even more harmful because it promotes discounting. Discounting means that banks obtain cash but do not pass it on to depositors, but instead discount it at a high price to make huge profits. The banks themselves and their employees collude with each other. Recently, withdrawing cash from banks is like climbing a ladder on a steep riverbank, motivated only by profit and unrelenting in their pursuit.

Furthermore, the benefit of banks issuing drafts is not only that they can replace cash, so a large amount of cash can be discounted out the back door, but also that they can create credit to purchase materials. In wartime, prices are bound to rise gradually. Due to the excessive issuance of bank drafts, prices are even more likely to rise. Moreover, bank drafts do not require interest deductions. After ten days, at most, a new draft is presented and exchanged. Recently, Hwa Chi stocks have only risen and not fallen, which is due to the loose cash position and the fact that bank drafts are causing trouble. It is not surprising that a small bank issues an average of 10 million yuan in drafts per month. It is also not surprising that Hwa Chi stocks rise by 100% in a month. Due to the banks' behind-the-scenes promotion, a small bank can earn at least 10 million yuan or more per month by excessively issuing drafts. No wonder that recently some bank employees are arrogant and complacent, while other salaried employees and ordinary people are more likely to appear emaciated and struggling to survive due to the double exploitation of prices and cash shortages.

In conclusion, issuing bank drafts and restricting cash withdrawals are two sides of the same coin and are absolutely linked. Bank drafts cannot achieve the status of being equivalent to cash, especially in the present time when there are many banks and a shortage of supplies. The excessive issuance of bank drafts and the restriction of cash withdrawals should be strictly prohibited. Since December 1, 1943, the Central Bank's Financial Affairs Inspection Office has banned financial institutions from issuing long-term drafts, both to improve the financial system and to gain the trust of the people. However, at that time, the issuance of drafts was limited, and its harm was not significant. However, the authorities had already planned for a rainy day and nipped problems in the bud. Now, just over a year later, why are banks allowed to excessively issue drafts, putting themselves in a contradictory position? Do they think that a ten-day period is harmless? It should be known that the ten-day period is just a trick. When it expires, no cash is paid, but another draft is exchanged for another ten days. Repeating this cycle, what is the difference between a bank's long-term draft and a bank's short-term draft? Moreover, the extent to which the Central Bank's currency is contracted is limited or may not be able to contract, while bank drafts can take the opportunity to be issued in large quantities. Not only is the currency supply in the market only increasing, but it seems that the Central Bank's exclusive right to issue currency is also shared equally by all banks and financial institutions. Is this the phenomenon that wartime financial control should have? The harm of the Central Bank's inflated currency issuance versus the simultaneous issuance of drafts and credit expansion by various banks is obvious to anyone with intelligence. It is hoped that the financial authorities will consider this carefully. Rather than allowing various banks and financial institutions to issue drafts, it is better to increase the issuance of currency quickly, thereby eliminating the exploitation of Chinese people and reducing the burden on the people.

### Random Talks on the European War (2)

The Soviet Red Army relentlessly bombarded German positions with this kind of artillery, pouring in tremendous amounts. In contrast, the British and American way of fighting was to deploy an absolute majority of aircraft to attack Germany with the power of the air force. Most of the British and American tanks were small and not very impressive. A German officer who participated in the Battle of Leipzig said so. However, above the British and American tank formations, their air force constantly provided cover and led the way. Before the tank formations even reached a city or town, the British and American aircraft would carry out a terrifying bombing, turning both cities and villages into flattened ground. Therefore, the German army had no choice but to abandon the artillery used to deal with these small tanks and retreat in droves. As a result, many places offered no resistance at all, allowing these small tanks to rampage at will. The British and American forces also used "air trains" to constantly replenish supplies, so even if the German army completely destroyed railways and roads, it could not reduce the speed of the British and American tank formations.

### Germany Lacks Repair Materials

Regarding the damage caused by air raids, Germany's speed of repair and restoration was initially truly astonishing. Major damage that normally took a month to repair could be repaired perfectly in Germany in just two or three hours, restoring it to its original state. When an iron bridge was bombed and fell into the river, it was soon lifted by a huge crane and re-erected on the river in its original form within a few hours. The same was true for factories, railways, and buildings. However, since last summer, the air raids by British and American aircraft have become increasingly frequent, and the materials for repair have gradually become scarce. As a result, the speed of restoration has decreased day by day, and finally, the railway network has been cut off inch by inch. In addition, due to the loss of Romania, there was a shortage of gasoline for the roads running across the country, making it difficult to make full use of them. As a result, the mobility, which can be called the lifeblood of internal operations, was completely lost. Moreover, high-speed highways in Germany were so large and solid that it seemed impossible to destroy them in a short time. As a result, once the battlefield moved to the country, these highways were used by the enemy to fully exert their mobility. "These roads are really good!" Soviet mechanized units moving along these modern highways often exclaimed. Today, Germany has become a ruin, and only these highways remain to show the achievements of German culture.

### Germany's Advantages

Although Germany was ultimately defeated, there are many things to learn from Germany. For example, the planning based on its scientific talent is one of them. The thorough mobilization of its citizens is also commendable. In order to compensate for the huge loss of manpower at the front, even housewives were mobilized, even mothers with children, numbering more than two million. As a result, the German military authorities were able to draw five million troops from the factories to the front. Those who received fresh troops were also properly arranged, with no one being redundant or working in a job that did not suit their abilities. Even in the early stages, production did not decline due to the replacement of male and female workers. The authorities had long considered the trivial household chores of housewives, and their working hours were always based on a three- or four-shift system, striving to reduce rest time. Later, as air raids intensified and more factory equipment was destroyed, and the repair work did not progress as well as expected, many people lost their jobs. As a result, some people were demobilized or transferred to work in other important factories. This measure proceeded smoothly and fairly until the end.

Especially in the food policy, its planning was carried out without regret, and everything was implemented with a perfect coupon system. As long as there was a ration card, bread, butter, sugar, vegetables, meat, etc. could be purchased, and the quantity did not change until the end.

### The Municipal Government Orders the Police Bureau to Strictly Prohibit Hoarding of Rice and Grain, and Hopes that Citizens Will Cooperate in Reporting Illegal Activities

The municipal government believes that, at the beginning of the implementation of emergency measures for rice and grain and the opening of rice transportation, there is a concern that a small number of merchants may take the opportunity to hoard, and that local competent authorities may restrict circulation under the pretext of maintaining local food supplies. Therefore, it has separately informed the relevant agencies to effectively prevent such incidents. Now, in order to ensure that the emergency measures obtain thorough results, it has ordered the Municipal Police Bureau to strictly investigate and prohibit merchants from taking the opportunity to hoard and restricting circulation under various pretexts, in order to eliminate malpractices and emphasize laws and orders. After receiving the order, the bureau has ordered the Economic Security Section and the Economic Police Corps to strictly comply, mobilizing all economic police to conduct thorough investigations and severely crack down on the above-mentioned illegal activities, and hopes that citizens will cooperate in reporting them.

### Special Bank Drafts of 50,000 and 100,000 Used as Cash in Circulation, Implemented Immediately

In order to curb the bad practice of discounting and eliminate the panic of cash shortage, the Central Reserve Bank, after active discussions and research, has determined concrete measures to regulate cash and is gradually implementing them. All difficulties will be solved step by step. In addition to issuing new 10,000 yuan notes from yesterday (14th), it is now also actively promoting the circulation of special Central Reserve Bank drafts based on the key points of regulating cash that were decided at a recent meeting with banks and financial institutions. Two types of special drafts, 50,000 yuan and 100,000 yuan, will be implemented immediately, canceling the horizontal lines and using them as cash in circulation, and can also be used for transfers. Other special drafts of 500,000 yuan and 1,000,000 yuan can be used for daily cash positions and can supplement exchange positions. As for the 10,000 yuan special draft, the horizontal lines will also be canceled and used as cash in circulation. According to the person in charge of the Central Reserve Bank, after the implementation of this method, the cash panic in the market can be resolved immediately, and there will never be a recurrence of past phenomena.

### Anxious About Scholarship Funds, Urging Wealthy People to Donate More

Recently, the weather has been extremely hot, and everyone's spirits seem to be a little depressed, which has affected our fundraising for scholarship funds. There are only a few people who have recognized the donations, which makes us, especially the thousands of poor students who are directly affected, very anxious. According to our budget, we should have an average of more than 10 million yuan in donations every day, and we can raise 300 million yuan in a month. However, the recent situation is that we have only received 2-3 million yuan a day in the past 8-9 days, or even only 300,000-400,000 yuan, which is too pitiful! In such a large city as Shanghai, there are wealthy people as numerous as the hairs on an ox, but everyone is so indifferent to this social welfare project of nurturing talents for the country, which is too cruel.

Dear readers: In today's era, we must see life more clearly. My property is given to me by the public, and it is temporary rather than permanent. We bring nothing with us when we are born, and we take nothing with us when we die. If we can understand this, we should have a great epiphany, turn private into public, create benefits for the public, and create living Buddhas for everyone, which is for ourselves and for our descendants to accumulate virtue, and we will be rewarded with good in the future and benefit endlessly. So, what is the value of donating a little scholarship money? Thinking of the thousands of poor students, it is indeed the most meaningful wish. The ancients said, "Accumulating wealth is not as good as accumulating virtue." I urge the wealthy people in Shanghai to have a good thought. The merit is immeasurable.

Attention Old Students: Students of all levels in universities, middle schools, and primary schools who have not yet received the application form at the museum are requested to collect it from 8:00 am to 5:00 pm on the 16th and 17th with their student status certificate. It can also be collected on their behalf. New students must apply to the original school. Do not delay. - This office is open -

### A General Discussion of Potatoes

— Zhao Wu

At a time when rice is scarce and the consumption of mixed grains is being promoted, it is necessary to introduce the types of mixed grains and increase their production. The potato is one type of mixed grain. This article provides a general overview of its varieties, characteristics, and cultivation methods, and is offered for the reference of those concerned about the mixed grain issue. The author, Mr. Zhao, is the Director of the Experimental Farm at the Agricultural College of St. John's University. This is also introduced here.

In recent years, due to natural disasters and man-made calamities in our country, agricultural products have often been harvested poorly, and the supply of staple foods such as rice and wheat is insufficient. Therefore, the cultivation of mixed grain crops has been promoted to supplement the shortfall. Among these, the potato, in particular, is a new contribution among the mixed grains, and its cultivation area is widespread, covering almost the entire globe. As early as the 18th century, Western countries had already advocated planting it, but because Westerners preferred wheat as a staple food and had become accustomed to it, it could not be popularized. However, at the end of the 18th century, Europe experienced a food crisis, and efforts were made to promote the widespread planting of potatoes. By the beginning of the 19th century, cultivation techniques had improved, and yields were abundant, making it one of the main agricultural products. The edible part of the potato is the underground stem, and the fruits are plump and rich in starch and sugar. In addition to being used as a staple food, it can be used as an industrial raw material (such as for extracting starch and alcohol). Potatoes are well-suited to the climate and soil conditions of various regions. If they are rotated with other crops, they can improve the soil and increase productivity.

### Characteristics

The potato is an annual herbaceous plant belonging to the nightshade family. It originates in the highlands of Chile and Peru in South America. Its characteristics are briefly described below:

Roots – These are fibrous roots that penetrate the soil to a depth of about two feet, but they are not very developed.

Stems – These are divided into above-ground stems and underground stems. The above-ground stems bear leaves and carry out photosynthesis, and they are two to three feet tall. The underground stems are called stolons, and their tips develop and swell to form tubers, which are oval or kidney-shaped and rich in starch and sugar. They can be cooked and eaten or used as an industrial raw material. The outer skin is white-yellow or light red, and the skin has depressions, commonly called eyes, which contain dormant buds. After planting, these buds develop and grow.

Leaves – These are alternate pinnate compound leaves with long petioles. The leaf shape is nearly round, and the color is dark green, soft, and juicy.

Flowers – The pistil and corolla are both divided into five petals, and the petals are connected in a tubular shape, forming a cyme inflorescence. The flower colors include pale white-purple and light yellow, etc. (To be continued)

Fruits – These are round or oblate, very small, and contain seeds that can be used for propagation. However, their heredity is very poor, so except for use in breeding new varieties, they are rarely used for propagation.

### Uses

Potatoes are a staple food in European and American countries, or used as vegetables and livestock feed. In our country, they are often used as a supplementary food. They can also be mixed with flour to make bread, and can be used as raw materials for the manufacture of starch and alcohol. The residue can also be used as feed for pigs.

### Varieties

There are many varieties of potatoes. More than two thousand varieties have already been discovered, and new ones are invented every year. If classified by use, there are edible varieties, industrial varieties, and mixed-use varieties. If classified by maturity period, there are early-maturing, mid-maturing, and late-maturing varieties. These are described below:

(A) Edible varieties: These are delicious and have a fine texture. They mature relatively early, and the tubers are medium in size, oblong, with smooth skin and few eyes. The flesh is white with a yellowish tint. They store well, but because they are planted early, the yield is not very abundant, so they are suitable for planting in gardens.

(B) Industrial varieties: These are used for extracting starch and manufacturing alcohol, and are also used for feeding livestock. They are high-yielding, contain a lot of starch, store well, and are disease-resistant. The tubers are large, so this type can be used when planting on a large scale.

(C) Mixed-use varieties: These potatoes contain a lot of starch and can be used as an industrial raw material. They also taste good, so they are the most commonly planted.

According to German test results, the earliness or lateness of the growing season is closely related to the amount of yield. Early-maturing varieties take 109 days from planting to maturity, and yield 2,000 catties per mu, with a starch content of 14.7%. Late-maturing varieties take 132 days to mature, and yield 4,000 catties per mu, with a starch content of 18.8%. Late-maturing varieties have a longer growing season, so the yield is abundant, the starch content is high, and the disease resistance is strong, so they are better than early-maturing varieties.

### Cultivation Methods

Climate: Potatoes prefer a cool and refreshing climate, and can be cultivated in both the north and south of China, but they grow best in a temperate climate, with high yields. During the growing season, they cannot tolerate extreme heat or drought, and too much rainfall can easily lead to root rot, so it is not very suitable.

Soil: The soil quality is not limited. Potatoes can be planted in any barren soil, newly reclaimed land, or dry and loose soil, but to obtain abundant yields and good quality, it is necessary to choose loose, well-drained, fertile sandy loam or clay loam. It is also important to pay attention to good drainage.

Fertilization: Potatoes require a large amount of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium, especially potassium. About 2,000 catties of decomposed compost, 30 catties of superphosphate of lime, 20 catties of potassium sulfate, or 100 catties of wood ash should be used per mu. These should be applied as a base fertilizer once before planting. For nitrogen fertilizer, about 20 catties of ammonium sulfate or 20 dan of human manure should be applied after planting.

Land Preparation: Before planting potatoes, the land must be plowed to loosen the soil so that the tubers can develop fully. If it is fallow land, it should be deeply plowed before winter freezing to freeze the eggs of germs and pests. For land preparation, high ridges should be used in low-lying areas with poor drainage, and flat ridges can be used in dry areas.

Seed Potatoes: Whether or not the selection of tubers is appropriate can affect the yield. During the potato growing season, select strong and disease-free plants in advance, and use them as seed potatoes at harvest time. The size of the seed potatoes should be moderate (about one liang in weight). Seed potatoes that are too small will not develop well and will not produce a good yield. Larger ones must be cut lengthwise into two or three pieces, but care should be taken to ensure that each piece has at least two eyes. The cut surface must be coated with wood ash to prevent rot. About 150 to 200 catties of seed potatoes are required per mu.

Planting Time: The planting time varies depending on the climate and variety in each region. In the suburbs of Shanghai, potatoes can be planted twice a year. The first time is in the spring, between February and March, and they can be harvested between June and July. The second time is in the autumn, in mid-August, and they are harvested in late October (the autumn potatoes are harvested and stored for use as seed potatoes for the following spring).

Planting Method: For the potato planting method, simply open a trench between the ridges, three to four inches deep. Then, place the seed potatoes in the trench at equal distances and cover them with soil. The width of the ridges should be two feet, and the plant spacing should be seven to eight inches.

Management: Potatoes can germinate two weeks after planting. During the growing season, cultivate twice to remove weeds. When the stems are about one foot tall, hill the soil to prevent the tubers from being exposed to the ground. If flower buds are found, they should be removed to ensure that the development of the tubers is vigorous and plump.

Harvest: The harvest time varies depending on the earliness or lateness of the variety. In Shanghai, early-maturing varieties are harvested in June and July, and autumn-sown varieties are harvested in late October when the stems and leaves turn yellow. The yield per mu is about 2,200 catties in fertile land and only about 1,500 catties in barren land.

Storage: Remove the soil from the potatoes and store them in a cool, dry place. If the quantity is large, use a cellar storage method. Dig a pit, cover the bottom with rice straw, pile the potatoes in, and cover them with wheat stalks. In winter, this will prevent them from freezing easily. Insert bamboo tubes into the center to allow air to circulate.

### Pests and Diseases

If yellow and dark brown spots are found on the leaf surface, pay attention and remove the diseased plants and burn them to prevent infection. If semi-spherical small beetles called  beetles are found eating the leaves of the potatoes, they should be killed by hand in the early morning when the adult beetles are not active. There is also a kind of cutworm that eats the roots. The affected plants will fall over and die. If they are found, the larvae should be dug up and killed near the plants, or sulfur powder or pyrethrum powder should be sprinkled around the roots to kill them.
