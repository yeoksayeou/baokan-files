### Enemy Ships and Vessels around the Ryukyu Islands: 50 Sunk and Destroyed; Fierce Attacks by Air and Naval Forces Yield Results

Imperial Japanese Headquarters Announcement

Tokyo, March 31st, Central News Agency Dispatch: Imperial Japanese Headquarters announced the following war situation in the Ryukyu Islands area at 4:30 PM on the 31st: Although the attacks by enemy mobile force carrier-based aircraft have ceased since March 30th, intense naval gunfire continues to be directed at Okinawa Island. Japanese air and naval forces have attacked enemy ships and vessels, and the confirmed results are as follows: Two aircraft carriers sunk, one battleship sunk, four cruisers sunk, six destroyers sunk, one transport ship sunk, and sixteen vessels of unknown type sunk. One battleship damaged, one battleship or cruiser damaged, one cruiser damaged, five destroyers damaged, one transport ship damaged, and eleven vessels of unknown type damaged.

Central Pacific, March 31st, Central News Agency Dispatch: The enemy mobile force in the seas and skies of Okinawa Island is continuously reinforcing its strength from the rear. Dozens of battleships, cruisers, and destroyers approach Okinawa Island and continue to patrol near Okinawa Island on the 30th. On the morning of the 31st, a portion of the enemy forces, including several battleships, approached Kume Island. Although dense fog covered the southwest area on the 30th, the enemy still launched approximately 300 carrier-based aircraft to attack various locations. The Japanese forces engaged in fierce fighting, and by dawn on the 30th, Japanese torpedo boats had sunk one enemy cruiser and one destroyer, and also sunk one enemy submarine.

### Japanese Soldiers and Civilians on Okinawa Island Await Orders, Preparing for a Great Decisive Battle

Tokyo, March 31st, Central News Agency Dispatch: The enemy forces closing in on the Okinawa fortress have launched an attack with their main forces. The Japanese army, in defense of the homeland, is fighting bravely. Thanks to the do-or-die efforts of the air and naval forces, two enemy aircraft carriers and fifty other enemy ships have been sunk, and thirty-nine battleships and other vessels have been damaged, resulting in the destruction of countless lives and vast amounts of supplies. Under these glorious achievements, morale is further boosted. Today, Japanese air forces continue to sortie bravely, and are relentlessly attacking the enemy fleet that is still patrolling near Okinawa Island and concentrating intense artillery fire on the southern part of the island, expanding the battle results. The results achieved so far are comparable to the combined achievements of the naval battles in the Philippine Sea and Leyte Gulf, where the enemy invasion forces were intercepted. It is expected that the enemy, having suffered bloodshed, will react with extreme caution. Furthermore, although enemy support ships continue to be sunk near Okinawa, they continue to reinforce their forces, but these are merely bait for the Japanese army, so future results will be even greater. In addition, the Japanese ground forces on Okinawa Island are also awaiting orders with intense and magnificent emotions.

Tokyo, March 31st, Central News Agency Dispatch: The enemy American forces are attempting to invade the Ryukyu Islands, so they have deployed the Pacific Fleet to gradually occupy the various islands of the Ryukyu Islands, with the attack on Okinawa Island being particularly fierce, and there is a strong possibility of an imminent landing. At the same time, the enemy relies on its vast war power to directly attack the various islands. Its mobile force is approaching the Kyushu region and is still patrolling in Japanese waters, with the apparent goal of cutting off the Japanese supply lines to the Ryukyu Islands battlefront. The enemy gunboats' bombardment of Okinawa Island is intensifying daily, averaging 500 rounds per day until the 27th, increasing to 2,000 rounds on the 28th, and reaching 7,000 rounds on the 29th. The operational activities of the enemy fleet around Okinawa Island are similar to the situation before the landing on Iwo Jima. Furthermore, small flotillas are approaching Okinawa Island along with the fleet, which confirms that the date of the enemy's operation to seize the island is approaching. The Japanese air and naval forces and special attack units are continuing to launch do-or-die attacks on enemy ships and vessels daily, achieving considerable results. In addition, the ground forces and civilians on Okinawa Island are actively preparing, hoping to launch a great decisive battle where one Japanese soldier kills ten enemies when the enemy troops step onto the island.

### Graduation Ceremony for Officer Trainees; Training Speech by Commander Chen, Emphasizing Cultivation and Providing Encouragement

Nanjing, March 31st, Central News Agency Dispatch: Twenty officer trainees from the seventh class of the Central Army Officer Training Corps completed their training, and a graduation ceremony was held at 9:00 AM on the 31st. Commander Chen personally attended and delivered a training speech, the gist of which is as follows:

I feel that the general public, whether young people or soldiers, lacks cultivation. Cultivation means that one must constantly study one's knowledge and constantly review one's actions. Cultivation is not a difficult problem. If one knows what needs to be done and constantly studies it, one can develop a habit. If one does not do what one should do, one will feel uneasy in one's heart. If one does what one should not do, one's conscience will be punished. People generally develop bad habits due to tradition, which hinders their progress in life and has a great impact on the nation. This is caused by a lack of cultivation.

Uphold Discipline, Unity of Knowledge and Action

Upholding discipline is a habit. If junior officers develop good habits, they do not necessarily need the supervision of their superiors. Upholding discipline is a form of cultivation, also known as character, which is a traditional habit. Mr. Wang Yangming said: "Knowing without acting cannot be called knowing." The unity of knowledge and action is the greatest goal of cultivation, and one must also be consistent in words and deeds. What we say, we must put into practice. It is better not to say what we cannot do. Now, many young people are either too unrestrained or too decadent, without any cultivation. In the past, when we were students, before entering military school, we felt very resentful towards the warlords. We felt very happy when we saw the opinions in the newspapers. At the same time, we saw many comrades who gradually went down the path of the warlords after entering military school. What is the reason for this? It is because of insufficient cultivation.

China is facing many difficulties at this stage. People generally only care about solving their own difficulties and do not care about the happiness of others. They only care about their own convenience and do not care about the convenience of others. This is a lack of cultivation, which has resulted in bad habits and has become a common problem. So-called learning and cultivation mean not causing difficulties for others, and not sacrificing the convenience of others for one's own convenience. Only in this way can one become a perfect person, and the army can become a perfect army.

Words and Deeds of Famous Generals Can Serve as Models

I hope that after returning to your posts, you will use the words and deeds of famous generals in history as a reference. How they commanded their subordinates, how they sought to create happiness for the country and the people, because learning is experience, which is the accumulated conclusion of success. Of course, we ourselves are not enough. We must also use the words and deeds of famous people in history and the words and deeds of famous generals as an aid to our own words and deeds. This is the most important thing. Secondly, we should also pay attention to making friends. We can also get a lot of help from friends, but we must make good friends. Today, I am not speaking as an officer, but as a senior telling you my experience as a farewell gift.

### Notes on Attending the Wartime People's Representative Conference

— Yifei

March 28th, a clear morning. The National Assembly Hall on Guofu Road was decorated with a sign that reads, "Wartime People's Representative Conference of Various Provinces and Cities." The venue was on the second floor, neatly arranged, and the walls were covered with large slogans, the most notable of which were "Tell the Truth Responsibly" and "Open Speech to Express Public Opinion."

Portraits of Representatives

There were eighteen units participating in the conference, with forty-nine representatives present. The representatives included professors, doctors, and businessmen, with elderly people with white hair and energetic young people. Their clothing varied, including long gowns and mandarin jackets, and Western suits. The "New People's Dress" of the representatives from the North was particularly unique. Since the representatives came from different provinces and cities, their dialects also differed. The chairman found it quite difficult to manage during the discussions.

Conference Atmosphere

On the second day of the conference, the discussions on war-related issues were heated, with speakers eager to express their views. Often, debates would last for a long time over a slight difference in wording. In particular, the passionate speeches and unique insights of Mr. Pan Junqian and Mr. Zhao Songpo, representatives from Tianjin, earned them considerable applause, adding color to the conference.

A Tense Moment

At 4:00 PM on the afternoon of the second day of the conference, just as Mr. Pan Junqian, a representative from Tianjin, was describing the harm caused by opium in Tianjin, air raid sirens blared. Ten enemy aircraft appeared in the sky, the sound of the engines clattering, corresponding to the booming sound of anti-aircraft guns. For safety, the chairman proposed a temporary adjournment, but after only five minutes, the enemy aircraft moved further away, and the representatives returned to the venue to continue the discussion. Unexpectedly, after a few more minutes, the enemy aircraft returned, flying very low, skimming over the roof of the venue, and indiscriminately firing machine guns, resulting in sixteen civilian deaths and injuries in the vicinity. At the time, the representatives disregarded the danger and returned to the venue to continue the meeting before the air raid alert was lifted. Their patriotic sincerity was admirable.

A Batch of Proposals

There were twenty-four proposals at the conference, the content of which was primarily related to national planning and people's livelihoods. Except for those that were similar and merged, fourteen proposals were formally passed. Among the important proposals in the category of national planning were the "Request to the Government to Protect the People's Freedom of Speech and Assembly, Adopt Public Opinion, and Establish Public Opinion Organs," proposed by Mr. Xu Lie and Mr. Xu Guangda, representatives from Beiping, as well as the "Launch a Unified National Salvation Movement to Inherit the Legacy of the National Father and Complete the Revolution" and "Unify the National Administrative System and Complete National Independence and Unity as Soon as Possible." Regarding people's livelihoods, in addition to the "Strengthen Local Security to Save Lives" and "Stabilize Food Prices and Facilitate the Transportation of Materials to Maintain the People's Livelihoods," the most notable proposal was the "Thoroughly Strengthen the National Anti-Opium Movement and Request the Government to Implement a Strict Anti-Opium Policy," proposed by the Tianjin representative. The representative bitterly denounced the harm of drugs, speaking with alarm, saying that there were more than 130,000 opium addicts in Tianjin, North China, accounting for one-tenth of the city's population, and more than 200 opium dens. It was even said that some were addicted to opium even before the age of twenty. The "Li Zhan" area in the bustling district of Tianjin was planning to open fifty opium dens, but the matter was stopped after opposition from the city's Anti-Opium Association and enthusiastic individuals. The city has now established the "Tianjin National Anti-Opium Association Smoking Cessation Hospital," which uses the "Dongguang Agent" smoking cessation drug invented by Dr. Zhengshan of a friendly country, which can eliminate opium addiction within forty-two hours. It has been repeatedly tested and is effective, curing many opium addicts. It is a pity that the original inventor keeps the prescription of the drug a secret, so it cannot be mass-produced to save opium addicts across the country from suffering.

### Japanese Forces on the North Coast of New Guinea Launch a Night Attack, Completely Occupying the Enemy Positions at Sansapor

Southern Front Base, March 31st, Central News Agency Dispatch: Japanese forces in the northern New Guinea area attacked enemy positions at Sansapor on the moonlit night of February 20th and completely occupied them. The enemy landed a large number of mobile forces in the area on March 21st of last year and installed acoustic devices around the airfield and positions to warn of approaching Japanese forces. In December of last year, after destroying the enemy positions, Japanese forces launched a fierce attack on Sansapor on the moonlit night of February 20th, and the enemy desperately resisted with land and naval forces, including hasty bombing, the dispatch of destroyers, and minesweepers, but all were repelled by the Japanese forces and retreated to the Mair area. The enemy forces in Sansapor were the advanced base for protecting the Mair airfield, and after the Japanese forces occupied it, they can ensure the stronghold on the northern coast of western New Guinea, and the Mair airfield has great military significance.

### Anti-Axis Forces Attempt to Encircle the Ruhr Area; German Forces Taking Effective Countermeasures

Berlin, March 31st, Central News Agency Dispatch: Reuter reports: Montgomery's intention to encircle the Ruhr area is becoming increasingly clear. The pressure of the British Second Army northward and eastward is greater than the pressure southwest towards the Ruhr industrial area. The anti-Axis forces have made little progress after crossing the Glebbeck, but their northern vanguard has advanced past Stadtlohn and Dulmen, pushing towards Munster. The vanguard in the south is advancing north and northeast from Marburg. If these northern and southern vanguards can meet in the Munster, Paderborn, and Kassel area, the Ruhr industrial area will be completely surrounded. The straight-line distance between the two vanguards is still over 100 kilometers, and the German authorities will undoubtedly strive to prevent the enemy from completing this plan. The enemy is still continuing to attack the German defensive positions between the Rhine, Ruhr, and Sieg rivers, and there have also been further attempts by the enemy to cross the river between Düsseldorf and Leverkusen in an attempt to attack the Ruhr industrial area from the front.

### Voting Rights Issue in the San Francisco Conference

Lisbon, March 31st, Central News Agency Dispatch: According to a Washington dispatch: The Japanese consulate announced on the 29th that, during the Yalta Conference, the Soviet representatives requested recognition of the voting rights of the Byelorussian and Ukrainian republics, so the Soviet Union could obtain three votes in the General Assembly. The American representatives also made securing three votes a condition. According to a London dispatch: Although Britain recognized the Soviet Union's three votes during the conference, it did not recognize the American three votes, and it was shocked by the American government's announcement.

Weekly Review

### China's Foundational Construction

— Wang Xiangrong

In the past half-year, the atmosphere of overall peace has been very strong, and the public's expectation for overall peace has become increasingly urgent. However, up to now, we have not been able to find the slightest glimmer of hope. Not only that, but with the support of Britain and the United States, Chongqing has launched a general counter-offensive against mainland China. Under these circumstances, is the realization of overall peace still possible? In our opinion, the realization of overall peace is absolutely possible, because its realization is not the hope of a certain part, but a historical necessity. In other words, the occurrence of the Sino-Japanese Incident has its historical inevitability, and the end of the Sino-Japanese Incident also has its historical inevitability. Regarding the Sino-Japanese issue, we believe that a comprehensive solution must be reached. But why is it still so clueless today? In our view, it is because the Chinese side has not been able to possess the conditions to cope with this historical necessity. The so-called conditions to cope with this historical necessity are the failure to complete China's foundational construction and the failure to establish a foundational perspective.

Everyone knows that the Sino-Japanese issue must be resolved comprehensively, and everyone also knows that the resolution of the Sino-Japanese issue is a political rather than a military matter. However, no one can calmly review the Sino-Japanese issue. We have seen that in recent years, the opinions in the peace zone have mostly been saying things that the Japanese love to hear. And what about the anti-Japanese war zone? It specializes in attacking Japan. In our view, both of these attitudes seem to obliterate the facts and distort the truth. They have not been able to speak from the standpoint of the Chinese people! Their arguments are solely based on emotion. In our view, this kind of emotion-based approach to examining and handling the Sino-Japanese issue is the greatest crisis for the future of China and Japan. But unfortunately, today's China is full of this high-pitched rhetoric.

Since the incident, over the past eight years, the Japanese side, whether government or civilian, has been able to adapt to the times and appropriately change its policies. In our view, this change in policy is a kind of self-reflection on the part of Japan. Why does Japan need to constantly reflect on itself? Because the world situation is constantly changing, and countries that survive in this environment cannot but change with it. But what about our country? Apart from hearing some high-pitched rhetoric, we can also get a principle, which is to respond to all changes with constancy. In the eyes of us young people, this attitude is very disappointing. We believe that whether we are examining a comprehensive solution to the Sino-Japanese issue or planning the post-war revival and construction of China, today, we Chinese must have a universal and thorough introspection movement. In our view, this introspection movement is the foundational construction of China.

We believe that when examining a comprehensive solution to the Sino-Japanese issue, we must have a basic concept, which is that China is a country that needs to survive independently, and Japan is also a country that needs to survive independently. When discussing China's post-war reconstruction, we also have a basic concept, which is that China must be an independent and autonomous country before we can talk about revival and reconstruction. This basic concept is the establishment of a Chinese foundational perspective and the completion of Chinese foundational construction.

Ten years ago, Mr. Fan Zhongyun and other ten professors issued a declaration on the construction of Chinese foundational culture, advocating neither complete Westernization nor complete Easternization, to save Chinese culture from the misfortune it suffered after the May Fourth Movement. At that time, the situation they encountered was not as difficult or as complex as it is today. Therefore, they only focused on the cultural aspect. But in today's situation, we believe that the construction of China's foundation is no longer applicable only to the cultural aspect, but also universally applicable to politics, economy, and military affairs. Therefore, we dare to use the strength of our few people to propose this slogan of building China's foundation. The construction of China's foundation is a very empty slogan. How can we complete the construction of China's foundation and establish a Chinese foundational perspective? Although we are all laymen in politics, we are also very willing to point out more concrete ways.

We believe that in today's situation, a comprehensive reform must be carried out. Political reform should strengthen the National Government and establish the basic strength for negotiating peace. Economic reform should stabilize people's livelihoods and cultivate national strength. Military reform should defend the country and assist in combat. Cultural reform should establish a new ethical outlook. To be more specific, in politics, we must point out that the Republic of China is unified, regardless of east, south, west, or north. In other words, the Republic of China must be a unified Republic of China. We also believe that talent must be the main focus, that the one-party dictatorship must be opened up, and that the legitimate freedom of the people must be guaranteed. In diplomacy, we should work with all friendly countries to seek construction from the standpoint of the Chinese people. In economics, we should establish thorough state capitalism, build a heavy industry China, and eliminate all disputes over interests through the control of state capital. In the military, we advocate centralized military power and oppose warlord separatism. In culture, we hope to use our inherent culture as a foundation, and absorb and digest foreign cultures to integrate them into a new culture. We believe that the future of the Chinese nation and the revival of the Republic of China must not be allowed to be manipulated by a few people. We do not want to revolt, nor do we have political ambitions, but we are a part of the Chinese nation, so we demand comprehensive reform.

Seventy years ago, China and Japan jointly sought reform, but seventy years later, Japan has become one of the world's great powers, while China has become weak and不堪. The biggest reason for this is that the Japanese can talk about reform from their own perspective. But we Chinese have always wanted to rely on others. Therefore, seventy years later, the results we can see are also vastly different. The Meiji Restoration in Japan created Japan, one of the four great modern powers, but the result of our Reform Movement of 1898 and revolution has deepened our semi-colonial status. This historical lesson makes us unable to not rise up again today. At the same time, the situation around us does not allow us to deceive others anymore. So at this time, we, with the strength of a few young people, put forward this slogan.

We demand that all Chinese people stand on China's foundation and strive for China's independence under this condition. We know very well that the establishment of a Chinese foundational perspective and the completion of Chinese foundational construction depend on the assistance of allied countries, but as the saying goes: "Heaven helps those who help themselves." Therefore, we believe that in the process of this movement, the most important thing is to rely on Chinese people with a sense of national concept to fight for the assistance of allied countries with the Chinese foundational struggle. We oppose all ideas of relying on external forces. We believe that as long as we can grasp reality, recognize the future, and continue to work hard, our future is bright. Conversely, no matter how much the allied countries assist us, it will be in vain!

Time does not allow us to procrastinate and deceive ourselves any longer. Japan has already begun the mobilization of the national armed forces, which is related to the fate of the nation. We do not demand a revolution, but we are a part of the Chinese nation, so we ask our compatriots to be aware and to reflect. And we ask our government to complete the foundational construction of China through comprehensive reforms, and to promote the realization of overall peace and the comprehensive solution of the Sino-Japanese issue through our own efforts.

### Declaration of the People's Representative Assembly (Continued)

Relieving People's Suffering

We demand reasonable economic measures to resolve the suffering of the people. In his Principle of People's Livelihood, the National Father advocated equalizing land ownership and regulating capital, aiming to protect national capital in order to resist the economic aggression of colonialism, while at the same time limiting the expansion of private capital, so as to avoid repeating the mistakes of European and American capitalism. At present, the people's livelihood is extremely difficult. If we do not quickly find ways to provide relief, the 400 million compatriots will have no way out. The war is the root cause. The war has led to insufficient production, inconvenient transportation, lack of raw materials, increased consumption, soaring prices, falling currency values, the deterioration of landlords, the heavy exploitation of corrupt forces, and the local distribution of spoils by corrupt officials. All of these are factors that have contributed to the suffering of the people today. We have personally experienced and suffered deeply in various places. We sincerely hope that the government will find ways to treat the symptoms and prescribe the right medicine, and strive to relieve one point of suffering for every point of suffering that can be relieved, and implement one step of measures for every step of measures that can be implemented, such as suppressing food prices, dredging up sources of materials, improving the material control system, strengthening industrial and commercial organizations, rectifying commercial ethics, and revitalizing light industry. We also hope that the government will find ways to implement these measures as soon as possible, and that the people should also conserve consumption as much as possible, increase production, and cooperate with the government.

National Armed Self-Defense

We must consolidate public security and complete the organization of national armed self-defense. In the National Father's teachings, communism has always been regarded as the source of national and social turmoil. Therefore, in his lectures on the Principle of People's Livelihood, the National Father specifically pointed out the errors of Marxist communism. The National Father's original intention of accommodating the Communists was to encourage the Communist Party to abandon its organization and ideology, join the Kuomintang, and follow the Three Principles of the People. This was clearly stated in the joint declaration of the National Father and Joffe. However, the Communist Party broke faith and attempted to seize the leadership of the National Revolution. Therefore, the Kuomintang decided to purge the Communists and further encircle and suppress them. Since the incident occurred, the communist bandits have taken advantage of the name of resisting Japan and saving the country. Over the years, the flames of communism have risen sharply, and wherever they go, they are like locusts. In the future, we must consolidate local public security, so that the people can live and work in peace, and universally implement military training, and ultimately form a national armed self-defense organization.

Hoping to See Implementation

The above six points are believed to be the key to alleviating the current difficult situation. If they can be implemented one by one, the improvement of other social education and cultural aspects can also be implemented step by step. We respectfully request the National Government to implement them separately as soon as possible, in order to comfort public opinion, and we also hope that our compatriots in the mainland will unite with us and continue the peace, anti-communist, and nation-building movement led by the late Chairman Wang during his lifetime, to realize the unfulfilled wishes of the National Father since his death twenty years ago, and to complete the construction of a new China based on the Three Principles of the People under the leadership of Chairman Chen. This is our declaration.

### The Shanghai Sub-Court of the Special Court Officially Established Today: Court President Cai Talks About Future Handling Policies

The National Government, in order to punish corrupt officials and eliminate illegal merchants, reduce litigation procedures, and strive for speedy handling of cases, specially established a Special Court in the capital last March. In this city, the 66th Supreme Defense Council also decided to set up a sub-court, and specially appointed Cai Rixin, the former Chief Prosecutor of the Jiangsu High Court, as the court president, with Zhao Zhengdang and Gao Nanqu as judges. Since accepting the appointment, Court President Cai has been making preparations and has decided to use the western building of the Shanghai Local Prosecutor's Office on Xichang Road as the court address. Now it is ready, and it will be officially established today (the 1st) and start working. It is reported that the internal organization of the court, under the court president, has a general office and a specialist office. The secretariat is presided over by the chief clerk, and there are two sections: general affairs and records. Important personnel have been decided. In order to understand the future handling policies of the sub-court, the reporter interviewed Court President Cai. He kindly gave the following statement:

Court President's Statement

"In recent years, the world has been deteriorating, and dishonest officials have been engaging in private gain, and ignorant merchants have been manipulating prices, resulting in the people's livelihood becoming increasingly difficult and the rule of law being lost. The government cherishes the people and knows that the usual measures are not enough to meet the needs of wartime. Therefore, the Regulations on Punishing Crimes Committed by Public Servants, the Special Criminal Law in Wartime, and the Regulations on Punishing Crimes of Hoarding Important Commodities have been formulated. Moreover, because ordinary judicial organs have too many levels of review, and it takes a long time to finalize a case, which is not enough to achieve the quick effect of punishment, the Special Court has been organized to hear cases that violate the specified articles in the above-mentioned laws through simple and quick procedures, and the crimes in Articles 1 to 6 of the Emergency Law on Punishing Crimes Endangering the Republic of China and Articles 339 to 341 and 346 to 348 of the Law on Offenses can also be tried by the Special Court. Once a judgment is approved, it will be executed immediately. This measure of the government is indeed important for governance and chaos, but on the one hand, it is hoped that the people of the country will be vigilant, so as to prevent the occurrence of such incidents. It is also the meaning of what the book says: "Punish to stop punishment, and hope for no punishment." Since the establishment of the Special Court in the capital, many cases of corruption have been handled, which has been heard and seen by the people of the country. The government believes that Shanghai is an important place and should set up a special court in Shanghai to handle the above-mentioned cases nearby. The Special Court Shanghai Sub-Court Organization Regulations have been promulgated. This court has been organized in accordance with the order and was established today. I am honored to be the court president, and I am deeply afraid that I will not be able to do the job well. In the future, if I receive cases issued by the government, I must handle them carefully, so as to ensure fairness and impartiality, and not to wrongly acquit anyone. I hope that all people in the city will follow the teachings of the law, not covet wealth through illegal means, so that such cases rarely occur, and the law can be used without punishment, which is a blessing for the country and society."

The salaries of staff members have also been increased, with the lowest-ranking appointee receiving a monthly salary of 18,325 yuan, and the same distribution of rice.

Adjusting Personnel

On the one hand, we are adjusting personnel to enhance administrative efficiency. For those who are old and weak, incompetent, have bad character, and unnecessary personnel, we are eliminating them. As of now, a total of 2,875 officials, officers, and police have been laid off (38 units in addition to the General Bureau), including all French personnel and other nationalities who were hired.

Uniforming Uniforms

Regarding uniforms, in the past, due to various reasons, the styles were quite inconsistent, which was not only unsightly but also violated the law. We have already ordered all units to modify them to be uniform. The titles have also been adjusted. (Ranks) such as police superintendent, police inspector, and police officer are still in use. All assistant staff and administrative staff titles are unified and changed to the same as police inspector and police officer. (Staff) are in accordance with the central government's regulations, with the titles of director, deputy director, department head, section chief, section member, clerk, inspector, and police officer as the standard.

Rectifying Duty

In other aspects of duty, we are also trying our best to rectify. In the General Bureau, we are strengthening the supervision work, and we will reward those who have merit and punish those who have made mistakes, and we will never show favoritism. In the branch bureaus, we are reducing posts and increasing patrols. Since February, although we cannot say that all evils have been eliminated, the practice of police officers extorting money along the way has indeed decreased. You are all representatives of public opinion and mouthpieces of the people. As the saying goes: "The bystander sees more than the player." In the future, I hope that you will not hesitate to guide us at any time. Not only will I personally accept it sincerely, but I also believe that our superiors will be happy to accept it.

Answering Questions

Suppressing Gambling

How should the authorities deal with the increasing gambling in this city? The authorities have long been determined to ban gambling. The bureau has heard about the increasing gambling in this city recently and has ordered all units to carry out suppression. Once discovered, they will be investigated and dealt with according to law. There are several such cases every day, but the bureau does not hold banquets. I hope you will try your best to report them. What was the outcome of the arrest of more than 100 foreign gold merchants last month? This matter involves economic security measures. However, the detainees were not gold merchants but Jews along the street. Because they were suspected of possessing enemy currency, they were warned and released within a few hours.

Detaining Vagrants

The air-raid shelters that have been completed in this city are often occupied by beggars and vagrants who live and use drugs. Is the authorities paying attention to this? In the past, we have ordered all units to arrest vagrants at any time and transfer them to labor camps. However, the number is limited, and the labor camps themselves have various problems with food and other issues, so they cannot accommodate all of them. If the above situation is reported, the bureau will pay attention to it and take measures to suppress it.

Jiang Yanyan Case

After the murderer Yanyan, who killed the traveler Xu Peiwen, was arrested, what is the progress of the interrogation? What crime will he be prosecuted for? This case is currently under detention and is still under investigation by the branch bureau. As for the progress of the interrogation, it is not convenient to disclose it before it is publicly announced. As for the prosecution, it is the power of the court, and the bureau is not in a position to comment.

Torture During Interrogation

Some branch bureaus still use torture when investigating cases. What are your opinions on this? The use of torture during interrogation has been repeatedly prohibited. If there are still such cases, you can report them as much as possible.

The equipment of the police stations in various counties and districts is not sufficient, which will inevitably affect the maintenance of public security in other places. What countermeasures do you have? The police stations in various counties and districts have always had firearms. However, the Municipal Government has now established a county administration, and all police matters in various counties should be handled by the administration.

Station Order

On the 16th of this month, the Police Department and China Central Railway Company held a joint meeting to discuss measures to rectify the order of the station. What are the specific countermeasures? This matter is currently being drafted by the company. In the future, legitimate travelers will have to provide documents to disperse the people, and government employees must have proof documents to purchase tickets and board the train. This measure will be announced and implemented next month.

Recently, it has been difficult for legitimate travelers to buy tickets for the Shanghai-Nanjing route, and they have to seek out the black market, which has a great impact on the evacuation of citizens to their hometowns. How does the police department plan to crack down on this? The situation in the North Station is roughly the same. The bureau will consider countermeasures and crack down on it.

### Mr. Yan Junren's Birthday Celebration Funds Transferred to Aid the Anti-Tuberculosis Association

Mr. Yan Junren is a man of great talent and virtue, admired both at home and abroad. In recent years, he has retired to Shanghai and shown concern for his homeland, providing much support for charitable and educational causes. This year, on his sixty-ninth birthday in early April according to the lunar calendar, Mr. Yan, in consideration of the difficult times, was unwilling to hold any celebrations. However, after repeated requests from relatives and friends, and considering that the Shanghai Anti-Tuberculosis Association's First and Second Lung Hospitals and clinics have been operating for many years, with considerable achievements in tuberculosis prevention, and that they provide treatment and work for the needy, relying on donations from all sectors of society for support, and that recent price increases have made it difficult to continue, with an estimated shortfall of 8 million yuan for this year, he generously agreed to transfer all the funds collected from relatives and friends to aid the Association's expenses. Seven institutions in this city, including the Continental Bank, Shanghai Commercial & Savings Bank, China Enterprise Bank, Songhua Bank, Jiuan Bank, Shen Bao Newspaper, and Xinwen Bao Newspaper, have been appointed to collect the birthday donations. Mr. Yan has extensive connections, and the number of people sending birthday gifts is considerable each day. In addition to issuing receipts, the names of the donors will also be published successively.
