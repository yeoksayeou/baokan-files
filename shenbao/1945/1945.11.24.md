### National Army Vanguard Crosses Lianshan, Rapidly Advances Towards Huludao and Jinzhou; Communist Army on PingSui Railway Invades Datong

[United Press, Chongqing, 3rd] According to news obtained by a United Press reporter from military circles, the National Army's 13th Corps, equipped with tanks, heavy artillery, and armored forces, is advancing towards Jinzhou. The vanguard of the National Army has already crossed Yunshan, with one part heading south directly towards Huludao, and another part advancing northeast towards Jinzhou. The National Army anticipates that the Communist Army will put up a strong resistance in Jinzhou. The main force of the Communist Army's armored divisions is currently concentrated in the Shenyang area, preparing to fully block the National Army's offensive.

[Reuters, Tianjin, 22nd] The National Army has entered the territory of the Nine Eastern Provinces and by tonight has reached 180 *li*, pressing towards Jinzhou, the central point of the Beining Railway, where approximately 10,000 to 20,000 Communist troops are stationed. It is expected that this will be the first place they resist the National Army. So far, the Communist troops encountered by the National Army have been poorly equipped and trained. The National Army's main force is advancing rapidly along the railway line, and Communist troops' destruction of tracks and bridges is immediately repaired by the National Army's road repair teams. The major battle of Jinzhou is expected to begin at the end of next week. If the National Army can capture it individually without significant loss of strength, then reaching Shenyang, more than 600 *li* away, should be easy.

[United Press, Chongqing, 23rd] According to reliable sources, General Ma Zhanshan is currently leading his troops to the territory of the Nine Eastern Provinces. It is also said that another Northeast guerrilla leader, General Wang Delin, has also mobilized his old troops to assist the National Army in taking over the Northeast. It is widely believed that General Ma Zhanshan still has great potential influence in the Northeast, especially in the Heilongjiang area.

[Further Dispatch] A high-ranking military official who recently returned here from Qinhuangdao told reporters: The Communist Army currently has two fully equipped divisions in the Northeast, and several armed brigades in North China, all of which are the most elite of the Eighth Route Army. He also said that all the armored vehicles, tanks, and artillery in the divisions were war materials that the Soviet Union received from the Japanese. Zhu De is currently in the Shenyang area, busy setting up the first line of defense near Jinzhou. The Communist Army intends to capture the National Army in one fell swoop when it reaches the railway line, but in any case, the National Army is currently deploying a three-pronged pincer movement to defeat their plan.

[United Press, Chongqing, 3rd] According to a spokesperson for the 12th War Zone Headquarters, the main force of the Communist Army on the PingSui Railway is advancing towards Datong. In the Datong area, the Communist Army has deployed five tanks, driven by "foreigners of unknown nationality." In addition, 40,000 Communist troops are heading to Tangshan via Guan. Near Tangshan's Kaiping, 10,000 Communist troops have long been engaged in destroying roads. Around Shanhaiguan, the army is about 40,000 strong. The Communist Army forcibly conscripted farmers near the railway line between Tianjin and Qinhuangdao, forcing them to destroy the tracks. It is rumored that the Communist troops heading to Jehol looted grain along the way. The National Army had conflicts with the Communist Army in Miyun County, 90 *li* north of Peiping, but they were not intense.

### Sino-Soviet Negotiations; Rumors of a Joint Communiqué Being Issued

[Reuters, Chongqing, 23rd] According to a local newspaper, China and the Soviet Union will soon issue a joint communiqué on the status of the Northeast and its joint administration. The Chinese and Soviet authorities are still in harmonious negotiations. The Soviet authorities are prepared to fulfill their treaty obligations. The fate of the Northeast depends on the political negotiations. If they proceed smoothly and are successful, then all major cities and towns in the Northeast can be defended by the National Army within a month and a half.

[United Press, Chongqing, 23rd] Reliable sources report that Marshal Malinovsky, commander of the Soviet forces in the Transbaikal region, has telegraphed the officials in charge of receiving the Northeast to return to Changchun and continue negotiations. According to Chinese newspapers, when Xiong Shihui, director of the Northeast Headquarters, was still in Changchun, Malinovsky proposed that China and the Soviet Union jointly manage various mineral resources in the Nine Eastern Provinces. One newspaper reported that the central officials who went to Changchun from Chongqing to take over were treated very poorly. The Soviet side placed them in the former Japanese Coal Industry Office, where they were actually under surveillance. The entire staff of more than 300 people was provided with only one car, two trucks, and a few horse-drawn carriages. On November 16th, the Communist Army surrounded the airfield. These receiving officials were protected by the Soviet side and were able to return on ten aircraft.

### Communist Army Claims to Have Occupied Yancheng; National Army Relieves the Peril in Baotou

Urgent appeals for sanctions from Ningxia, Henan, Singapore, and other places

[United Press, Chongqing, 23rd] The Communist Army announced today that the New Fourth Army has occupied Yancheng.

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 23rd] Hundreds of thousands of people from the counties of Sizhou, Xuyi, Lingbi, Wuhe, Tianchang, Dingyuan, Jiashan, and other cities in Anhui Province have fled to the Tianjin-Pukou Railway due to the brutal killings by the Communist Army.

[Central News Agency, Luohe, 23rd] The Communist Army has now gathered more than 20,000 troops in Zaoyang and its surrounding areas of Qifanggang, Xiangyangzhen, and Heilongmiao, equipped with more than 1,000 machine guns, attempting to defend the Dahong and Tongbai mountains they have seized. In addition, the Fifth Division Guard Regiment and the core army of Li Xian's Communist Army have recently expanded their organization into the 33rd, 34th, and 35th Regiments, claiming that they will establish a base in the Dahong and Tongbai mountains, disrupt transportation, and attack the National Army as a backing for the Communist Party's negotiations with the government. Gong Yunjian, the Communist Party district chief of Queshan, and the leaders of Luchuan and Yuan Xinren surrendered to the Queshan County government on the 10th.

[United Press, Chongqing, 23rd] After the National Army adopted the tactic of breaking through the encirclement in Baotou, the perilous situation in Baotou has been relieved. The Communist Army then resorted to flank warfare and has reached 30 miles west of Baotou, attempting to penetrate deep into the Suiyuan region of Free China.

[Central News Agency, Tianjin, 23rd] Passenger tickets are sold on the Beining Railway as far as Tangshan, but the Communist Army still harasses the area from time to time. On the evening of the 21st, a small group of them sneaked into the area between Chadian and Lutai, attempting to destroy the No. 18 and No. 19 railway bridges. Fortunately, they were discovered and driven away by the road repair team, so traffic between Tianjin and Tangshan has been unimpeded in recent days. However, passenger trains between Peiping and Tianjin have been delayed in the past two days due to the frequent appearance of Communist troops lurking along the line.

[Central News Agency, Dingyuanying, Alashan Banner, 23rd] Organizations such as the Ningxia Alashan Banner Farmers, Businessmen, and Workers Association have sent a telegram to Chairman Chiang, stating that the Communist Army is causing chaos and disturbing the country, and requesting that effective sanctions be taken quickly.

[Central News Agency, Kaifeng, 23rd] Organizations such as the Henan Provincial Farmers Association, Construction Industry, Vocational Workers Union Federation, and Postal Workers Union have jointly sent a telegram to the whole country, requesting joint efforts to stop the Communist Army's actions that harm the country and the people.

[Central News Agency, Singapore, 22nd] Overseas Chinese here are concerned about the crisis in the motherland, and all compatriots deeply hate the Communist Party's illegal attacks.

### Vietnamese Communist Party Dissolved

[Central News Agency, Hanoi, 22nd] The Central Executive Committee of the Vietnamese Communist Party officially announced in the *Min Guuo Daily* that it has voluntarily disbanded, effective immediately, and will establish a Marxist Research Society.

### Zhou Enlai Awaits Flight to Yan'an; Nineteen Companions, Ye Jianying May Come to Chongqing

[This Newspaper, Chongqing, 23rd] Zhou Enlai is still waiting to fly to Yan'an in recent days. Because Zhou is traveling on an American P-47 aircraft, which flies to Chongqing from Shanghai, the aircraft has tried to fly three times but turned back to Shanghai due to thick ice forming on the aircraft in the highlands between Sichuan and Hubei due to the recent cold wave. Zhou is accompanied by fifteen staff members, and one reporter each from the Associated Press, United Press, the *Sun*, and the *New York Times*, totaling twenty people. It is heard that Ye Jianying may accompany Zhou to Chongqing as a representative of the Political Consultative Conference and to participate in the Three-Man Group military meeting. If Zhou can shorten his time in Yan'an, and if the Communist Party can accept the central government's intentions, the Political Conference may be convened on the first of next month.

### Being Considered by the Ministries of Finance and Economy; Conversion of Puppet Currency Funds; Leaders of Various Industries and Businesses Express Opinions for Reference

[Special Dispatch from This Newspaper] Since the promulgation that 200 puppet currency units equal one legal currency unit, most of the account balances in the city's industrial and commercial sectors have been adjusted since September or October. A small number of merchants will have to wait until the beginning of the year to sort things out. The most difficult issue to resolve is the conversion of capital. This newspaper's economic reporter learned from official sources that nearly 200 industry associations in the city have appointed reorganization committees, but it is said that membership registration in each association is not very enthusiastic. Similarly, the industrial and commercial registration to be organized by the Bureau of Social Affairs, as well as the business declaration of direct tax bureau, are also difficult to fill out because the capital conversion issue has not been decided. Regarding this issue, the reporter visited various relevant parties to explore opinions and summarized them as follows:

Concrete Measures Not Yet Decided

According to the person in charge of the Accountants Reorganization Association, the association has organized a small group meeting to discuss the reorganization of capital amount many times. The plans proposed by various accountants also number dozens, but so far there is no concrete plan that is completely legal and easy to implement. However, after summarizing the various accountants' plans, the following is assumed: (A) If the funds are entirely legal currency, and were forcibly converted into puppet currency at a rate of 200 to 1, then the original amount of legal currency should be restored. (B) If the capital was originally legal currency, and the capital was increased after the circulation of puppet currency, in other words, in addition to the capital amount of legal currency being converted at a rate of 200 to 1, and then puppet currency was received as increased capital, the original capital should still be restored to the legal currency amount, and then the assets should be roughly estimated. If the situation is still good, then the increased amount of puppet currency capital received should be converted into legal currency at a rate of one to one. (C) If the funds were entirely collected after the circulation of puppet currency, then the assets should be largely estimated, and if the situation is still good, then they should be converted at a rate of one to one. If the above proposed method results in excessively high or low net assets, then procedures for increasing or decreasing capital should be followed. In short, all efforts should be made to simplify the conversion process to avoid multiple changes. As for the tax issue, in addition to the fact that excessively high net assets should be handled according to the method of raising stocks and distributing dividends, the government should exempt income tax and profit tax on the difference obtained from capital conversion.

Accounting Experts Express Opinions

The reporter also interviewed multiple accounting experts on this matter. According to them, if this method is studied from the perspective of accounting theory, there are certainly many issues that still need to be discussed. However, for the sake of simplifying the reorganization of industrial and commercial capital amounts, it is still a principle that can be adopted. If other exceptional problems are discovered during implementation, they can be handled separately. It can be seen from this that the difficulty of the capital amount conversion problem is not without obstacles to the recovery of industry and commerce. The City Chamber of Commerce has also telegraphed the Ministries of Economy and Finance to clearly indicate the method, but has not yet received a response, which shows that the government is also considering this issue carefully. The City Chamber of Commerce, for this capital amount conversion problem that is not easy to solve but must be resolved quickly, has specially proposed it for discussion in the Industrial and Commercial Laws and Regulations Research Committee organized by the chamber, and invited famous accounting law experts and industrial and commercial leaders in the city to jointly study it. A more reasonable method for resolving this capital amount conversion problem may be agreed upon soon.

Temporary Fluctuations Can Be Resolved

According to the executive director of the Chamber of Commerce, the business community in the city has already experienced a period of volatility since the clearly defined conversion rate for puppet currency was announced, but this only refers to the puppet currency circulating on the market. Now that it has been implemented and withdrawn, it will soon come to an end. As for the conversion of general property amounts in accounts, it is not necessary to convert them all according to this ratio. Moreover, in the case of banks and trust businesses, how to legally reorganize and convert the puppet currency capital received when puppet organizations forcibly increased capital is particularly difficult. I hope that if any industrial and commercial sectors have concrete methods, they will provide them as much as possible so that we can gather ideas and benefit from each other and make suggestions to the government. Because the various difficulties in the recovered area, especially the suffering caused by frequent changes in currency value, are best known to us merchants. Now the Chamber of Commerce has submitted a request to the Ministries of Economy and Finance for instructions. It would be unwise to criticize after the government's joint legal regulations are in place.

The Central Government Cares About the City's Industry and Commerce

According to the director of the Industrial and Commercial Laws and Regulations Research Committee of the Chamber of Commerce, the city's industry and commerce are very concerned and eagerly hope to reduce fluctuations as much as possible within the possible scope so that the restoration work can proceed smoothly. I sincerely hope that this capital conversion problem can be resolved as soon as possible. Recently, most of the visits and inquiries to the association have focused on this issue, but to find a completely satisfactory method that is both reasonable and legal, as the representative of the Accountants Association said, there is still no concrete method and further research is needed.

Reorganizing Funds Worth Considering

Pan, the person in charge of the City's Machinery Dyeing and Weaving Industry Association, said that the reorganization of the capital amount on the enterprise's books is indeed a problem worth worrying about. The association has discussed it many times, but there is no proper method. However, the idea of converting part of it at a rate of 200 to 1 is not well-considered. Because the 200 to 1 ratio is a redemption method determined by the central government in consideration of the suffering of circulating puppet currency in the recovered area. As for capital, in accounting terms, it is the balance of assets minus liabilities, and it is not the capital owner's existing currency. The form of capital has long been changed after several operations, and the value of net assets must be reorganized, so how can the method of reorganizing circulating currency be used to reorganize the capital amount? The association is currently gathering colleagues to discuss this issue in detail.

### Accountants Association; Decides on Processing Method

The Reorganization Committee of the Shanghai Institute of Certified Public Accountants has decided and passed the method of converting enterprise puppet currency capital into legal currency. The decision on the current amount of enterprise capital can only be based on the net value of its existing assets and accurately account for its legal currency value as the basis for its legal currency capital. The proposed method is: (1) If the capital was originally legal currency and was later converted to puppet currency but the capital was not increased or decreased, the capital should be restored to its original legal currency amount. (2) If the capital was originally legal currency and was later converted to puppet currency and the puppet currency capital was increased, the net value should be estimated in legal currency based on its existing assets. If this net value is sufficient to cover the original amount of puppet currency capital on the books, it may be converted to legal currency at the original amount of puppet currency. If the amount is insufficient, the investors should make up the full amount in legal currency or reduce their capital amount. (3) If the capital was puppet currency from the beginning, it should be handled in accordance with the provisions of the second item above. The processing and adjustment of enterprise capital should be carried out by the person in charge of the company or enterprise, who should convene a meeting of shareholders or investors to submit the capital processing method for approval and then implement it in order to avoid disputes. In the future, when the monetary system is stable and the tax system is revised, the net value of assets will be accurately accounted for and the amount of capital will be adjusted to achieve the goal of accounting accuracy, which is the only wish of our accountant colleagues.

### Editorial: The Control of Atomic Energy

Our Minister of Foreign Affairs recently sent a note to US Secretary of State Byrnes stating the Chinese government's views on the control of atomic energy, declaring two points: (1) The Chinese government hopes that the Atomic Energy Management Committee under construction will be established immediately to ensure that this kind of energy is transferred away from destructive goals and used for peaceful and humanitarian purposes; (2) The Chinese government fully recognizes that the only way to thoroughly protect civilization from being destroyed by scientific knowledge is to abandon war. This can only be achieved by consolidating and expanding the power of the United Nations organization. This note reaffirms our country's basic principles for dealing with international issues: that is, in order to maintain international justice and human civilization, we advocate that the use of atomic energy should be shifted from its destructive goals to goals that benefit mankind; war should be abandoned, and the organizational power of the United Nations should be consolidated and expanded. The National Government has never had selfish motives in dealing with international issues, but stands on the position of maintaining international justice and human civilization. This is not only supported by the people of the whole country, but also warmly supported by other general countries.

We have often heard of other countries' foreign policies: such as the US Monroe Doctrine and Open Door Policy, and the British Balance of Power, etc. If someone asks what our foreign policy is, we can say that it is to maintain international justice and human civilization. In the past, we could say that we had no foreign policy. In the situation of a semi-colony, we were always in a passive position in international politics. We could only act passively and could not provide our opinions actively. Now the situation has changed. In the past few years, our country's activities in international politics have gradually solidified into our country's foreign policy, which is a very gratifying thing.

In the treacherous international politics, many hidden reefs will inevitably form, most of which are caused by hegemonic thinking. Our advocacy of maintaining justice is not entirely an empty voice, but expresses the wishes of many small and weak nations. Maintaining justice and seeking the welfare of mankind are originally lofty moral values. Our foreign policy is to maintain these moral values. The solidification of this policy is due to the principle of impartiality and peace in our country's Three People's Principles. Impartiality is neither biased nor partisan, and it is precisely the advocacy of justice; harmony is harmony, and peace is balance. From the starting point of impartiality and peace, we advocate that there should be coordination internationally, and these basic moral values should be maintained. However, the solidification of this policy has also been through painful experiences. In the past, because international justice was not upheld, there was the "September 18th Incident"; because international justice was not promoted, it led to foreign aggression. Therefore, the solidification of this policy is the result of a hundred years of humiliation, eight years of war, and the shedding of countless blood. This represents the ideal of our nation, and at the same time, it can be said to represent the hope of mankind.

Regarding the control of atomic energy, we should especially focus on the standpoint of international justice and the welfare of mankind. Since the dropping of two atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the entire future of mankind has changed. The use of atomic energy may bring infinite happiness to mankind, or it may lead to the destruction of the entire human race. Just think about it, one atomic bomb almost destroyed the entire Hiroshima, killing and injuring more than 300,000 people; then the entire country, the entire world, could be destroyed by a very small number of atomic bombs. Mankind has entered a new era due to the use of atomic energy. This era will be a watershed in human history. If atomic energy is used for the benefit of mankind, future generations will see today's humans as if modern humans see humans in the Stone Age.

Because atomic energy is very destructive, if it is used as a weapon, it will be a decisive factor in future wars. Whoever can manufacture a large amount of atomic bombs can control future wars. Therefore, the views of various countries on the control of atomic energy may not be the same. Although the success of using nuclear energy to manufacture atomic bombs was in the United States, it was achieved through international cooperation. The United Kingdom supplied talent, Canada supplied talent and necessary materials, and the United States also supplied talent and materials; in addition, there were Italian scientists, German Jewish scientists who fled abroad, and Danish scientists. Especially because the success of atomic bomb manufacturing was in the United States, the United States seemed to regard it as a magic weapon bestowed by God. It obtained this magic weapon due to God's entrustment, to use it to maintain world peace. The Soviet Union did not participate in this international cooperation, so it demanded openness. On the point of openness and secrecy, there is actually no dispute. No scientific invention can maintain long-term secrecy; the question is how to shift the goal of its use, from its destructive properties to seeking peace for mankind and seeking welfare for mankind. On this point, our government's views on the control of nuclear energy are indeed worthy of our praise.

But the main point of the problem is still that mankind should repent and have a new outlook on life and a new outlook on the country because of the successful use of atomic energy. Because atomic energy is very destructive, human life should be thoroughly reformed and strive for harmony. The failure of the Axis countries to control the world with hegemonic tactics should awaken other countries that think of controlling the world with hegemonic tactics, and no longer commit the same mistakes. The success of atomic bomb use should also awaken their futility of their attempts: however, even now there may still be countries that think of controlling the world with thunderous tactics. The atomic bomb has changed the world, and the atomic bomb should change people's hearts even more. We especially feel resentment and regret that in such an atomic age, how should our whole country unite and cooperate in the arduous task of nation-building and catch up? We were originally an industrially backward country, and people have already reached the use of atomic energy, while we are still stuck in the state of handicrafts. Now that the eight-year War of Resistance has ended victoriously, it is the time to work hard for rehabilitation and move towards the road of nation-building, but there are still people with ulterior motives who sabotage transportation and rebel with troops. The people are already longing for governance, how can they endure war again. The atomic bomb should awaken them!

Whether mankind can abandon war is not the question we want to answer. In the international aspect, if we want to prevent war, we can only strengthen the power of international organizations. Because of the use of atomic energy, the organizational power of the United Nations should be strengthened and consolidated. This is the most effective international method of controlling atomic energy. In our government's statement on its views on the control of atomic energy, this is another point that is worth praising. The incompetence of the past League of Nations failed to prevent the outbreak of the Second World War. Now, because of the use of atomic energy, we cannot repeat the mistakes of the past. We must strengthen and consolidate the organizations of the United Nations, so that mankind can avoid mutual slaughter and enter a new era; mankind can benefit from the successful use of atomic energy.

### The British House of Commons Debates the Washington Atomic Bomb Declaration; Attlee Calls on All Countries to Respond

[Central News Agency Reporter Ren Lingsun, London, 22nd Dispatch] British Prime Minister Attlee, when deliberating in the House of Commons at noon on the 22nd, reported on his trip to the United States and called on all countries to broadly endorse the principles outlined in the statement on atomic energy jointly issued in Washington by himself, US President Truman, and Canadian Prime Minister King. The House of Commons was packed when the British Prime Minister delivered his speech. He told those present that what the United Kingdom, the United States, and Canada discussed during the Washington talks was not only the future policy on atomic energy, but also the greater issue of eliminating world wars. From Attlee's point of view, the atomic bomb has made the general public realize that if civilization is to be maintained, a world war must never be allowed to recur. "If countries do not act in good faith and are determined not to use the threat of war as an instrument of policy, the international community will not be able to effectively control the atomic bomb and other destructive weapons." According to the Prime Minister, the Washington Conference was held at his suggestion.

Eden's Speech Targets the Soviet Union

Former Foreign Secretary Eden then spoke, suggesting that the veto power stipulated in the United Nations Charter should be abolished to adapt to the situation after the discovery of atomic energy, and called on all countries to frankly state their current views on sovereignty. Eden also discussed relations with the Soviet Union, saying: The Soviet Union's suspicion and distrust of its two major allies, the United Kingdom and the United States, who jointly achieved victory, is deepening, which is undeniable and deeply regrettable. He firmly believes that the peace of the future depends on the understanding between the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union. We know that the Soviet Union's preparations are not to deal with us, and we also hope that it will deepen our preparations, which are also not to deal with the Soviet Union.

### Full Text of the British Prime Minister's Speech

[Reuters, London, 23rd Dispatch] British Prime Minister Attlee declared in the House of Commons last night that all weapons of total war are sufficient to destroy everything. If we want civilization to continue to exist, we must eliminate total war and prevent it from appearing in the world again. None of the weapons applicable to total destruction can occupy any legitimate position among the necessary weapons used for ordinary maintenance of internal security and protection of the government against illegal actions. He then described the details of his consultations with the US President on atomic energy, saying, "I think it is impossible to turn the atomic bomb into a simple issue without mentioning other weapons for destruction. In the past, there was a time when the weapons used in war were very primitive in our eyes today. The losses and destruction caused by war could often be repaired and restored in a few years. Although the pain was great, it was still limited, and sometimes the losses were even minor. Those in power calculated the cost of war and compared it with the benefits they obtained, and it was still worth using. In fact, the so-called benefits are not worth mentioning today. This attitude towards war can no longer be held in our generation."

### To Maintain Civilization and Prevent War from Recurring

The atomic bomb is now the latest term for destructiveness, but this may not be the last. As of today, there is no way to deal with it. Therefore, if we want civilization to continue to exist, we must prevent the recurrence of the First and Second World Wars. Therefore, when I addressed the US President, spoke at the City Hall, and in various discussions, I always thought about what kind of world order is necessary in the new era when science has placed such tragic weapons in human hands, not only must the atomic bomb be eliminated from the armories of all countries. I emphasize this point because there have been many attempts to eliminate certain weapons or certain war behaviors and have achieved some success in the past. In the past, there have been several wars in which both sides were able to faithfully abide by the Geneva Conventions, but the attempt to eliminate certain weapons can be said to have failed. Before the outbreak of the war from 1914 to 1918, the use of gas warfare was prohibited, but it was still used later. I dare say that if the Nazis thought it was worthwhile to use gas, they would have used it again in this war. Today, the power of bombing a city is enough to fill the world with terror, and in this war, the citizens of London have tasted this every day. I do not believe that in a world of war, except for a very limited scope, the "Queensberry Rules" (this rule was originally used for boxing matches) can be applied.

### If There is No Good Faith, Control Will Be Difficult to Achieve

We should now pay attention to the fact that in a war of comparable scale to this war, all kinds of weapons will be needed. The large-scale use of atomic bombs will inevitably result in the complete destruction of large cities, the deaths of tens of millions of people, and the regression of civilization to an unimaginable era. Even if we exhaust our efforts, we cannot find a safe way to effectively guarantee the prevention of a country that is determined to invade from manufacturing atomic weapons. Since all countries are faced with the tragic reality of destructive science, they will urgently realize that it is imperative to find a way to get rid of the poison of war from the world.

The meetings of the United Nations organizations are now undoubtedly aimed at eliminating war. I use the words "firmly adhere to this" because in my opinion, this is the core of the problem. Just like the inspection or control system of weapons, it is difficult to be effective without sincerity. However, no matter how carefully all international organizations are formed, if all countries are not determined not to use war or the threat of war as an instrument of policy, and if all countries are determined to treat each other with mutual trust and prevent war from happening, then there will be no benefit. This is the only true solution, and all defense methods that contain any chance of success cannot be ignored or underestimated, but mutual trust is ultimately necessary.

### Mutual Exchange of Knowledge Between the United Kingdom, the United States, and Canada

We should remember that there is already a vast area of trust on the ground today, that is, there will never be a day when war will break out between us and any autonomous territory. There will never be a day when war will break out between the United Kingdom or Canada or any other autonomous territory and the United States. (Applause) Broadcasting this trust to the world seems to be the work that any politician should do. The Washington Declaration was made to increase trust so that we can work harder to keep the fear of war away from the world. In this declaration, the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom jointly stated that they are willing to exchange basic scientific knowledge and consult with any country willing to reciprocate to send scientists to exchange knowledge. The Prime Minister then said that the development of atomic energy for peaceful purposes is unlikely to be realized without many years of research, or it may not be realized in a few years. The procedures and methods currently under development should lead to this purpose. People from several sides have suggested that the knowledge of this method should be made known to all, like basic scientific information. However, I do not think it is wise to tell the world by radio broadcast. First, this knowledge cannot be made clear to people in the form of ways, manuals, or blueprints. It can only guide scientists and technicians to a factory to explain everything in detail before they can understand it. And there are only a limited number of people with this expert knowledge. It is impossible to do this without their personal presence, and it takes a long time. If this is done to various countries, it is obviously extremely difficult, and I also think that it should not only be done to a specific number of countries. Second, this invention can be used for peace and war.

### It is Obviously Not Appropriate to Disclose Weapon Secrets at Present

The United Nations organization has just been born and has not yet left its cradle. Is it wise to advertise to the world the procedures for manufacturing destructive weapons? We mean that this must wait until there is greater trust and greater security guarantees between countries. Now we should ask, what kind of guarantee can be slightly effective? Have you not said that it is actually impossible to think of a guarantee system that is sufficient to be effective? I ask the whole House to pay attention to the words in the third section of the joint declaration, so that we can know that without mutual trust, no system can be effective. Although the method of creating atomic energy is quite complicated and requires a large airport, the finished product is quite small. The bomb in Hiroshima was not very heavy, but controlling this extremely dangerous substance obviously requires extreme caution. However, the countries that signed the Washington Declaration have stated that once an effective guarantee that can be implemented can be agreed upon, they are willing to share the methods of actually using this invention in industry with all countries on a reciprocal basis. In order to achieve this goal, we have suggested setting up a committee in the League of Nations organization. The Prime Minister then asked the whole House to pay special attention to the regulations that the committee's work should be carried out step by step. He also emphasized that special actions should be based on the need for trust. The Prime Minister also asked the whole House to note that the committee will not only deal with atomic energy, but will also involve all weapons applicable to total destruction. At this point, the Prime Minister repeated the original declaration, and said, "This is our declaration, and I hope the world will respond to this principle. Now I specially put forward here a suggestion to spread scientific information for peaceful purposes and to prevent its misuse in war, and I hope that all countries will accept it."

### Foreign Secretary Bevin Clarifies the British Position; Please Show Your Cards

[Reuters, London, 23rd Dispatch] British Foreign Secretary Bevin continued the two-day foreign policy debate in the House of Commons today, asking any country, large or small, that expresses suspicion of the United Kingdom to speak clearly, because only frankness can overcome suspicions between countries. "I want to reiterate what I said before, that is, show our cards on the table."

Here are the key points of his policies towards various countries: "France": We hope to cooperate closely with the new French government.

"Italy": It is hoped that the northern provinces of Italy, which are currently occupied by the Allied forces, will be returned to the US government within a few weeks, except for a small part.

"Greece": It is hoped that Greek politician Themistoklis Sofoulis will continue to be in power to save the political crisis. It does not support holding a referendum under the current circumstances.

"Iran": The British government has recently ordered the military authorities to strictly abide by the British-Soviet-Iranian Treaty.

### Nazi Party Members Have Many Conspiracies; They Plan to Bomb the Nuremberg Court; They All Know that the Lives of War Criminals Are Difficult to Save; Destroying the Court Will Make the Leaders Die Together

[Reuters, London, 23rd Dispatch] The Nuremberg Court now employs many German civilians. One of them, a nineteen-year-old girl named Rommel, works as a librarian. She recently told a reporter from the Daily Mail stationed in Nuremberg that we are all afraid of encountering misfortune because the Nazis in Bavaria and Nuremberg will try to bomb the court. I know that you British have never thought about how much you are envied here, and you have never expected how many lawless people are lurking around you. They have not acted yet, but we believe that they will act when they see how the war criminals are being tried. They all know that most of the war criminals will not be able to save their lives, so they will not hesitate to destroy the court and make their former leaders die together. The trial of the Nazi leaders has entered its fourth day today. Presiding Judge Lord Lawrence announced that the trial will be suspended for one day tomorrow. US prosecutor Wallace continued to describe the process of Nazi conspirators controlling Germany.

### Korean Leader Kim Gu

— Wu Jiatang

[Special Report from This Newspaper] Chairman Chiang's special plane, which had been staying in Shanghai for four days, took off from Shanghai at 8:00 AM yesterday morning under the warm sunlight, carrying Kim Gu, Chairman of the Korean Provisional Government, and four of his staff members, heading east. When Mr. Kim left Jiangwan Airport, he indicated that he might return to Shanghai again soon, but the date was still difficult to determine. He stated that his future policies will be aimed at promoting friendly relations between China and Korea as the most important goal; at the same time, he expressed his deep gratitude to the various military and political leaders in Shanghai for their warm hospitality.

A Shocking Scene in Hongkou Park

Kim Gu—a fresh revolutionary leader—Chairman of the Korean Provisional Government, amidst cheers of victory, was the first to win the banner of freedom and independence for his country and returned to Seoul yesterday.

Although he is already in his seventies, his face still reveals a rare composure, fully demonstrating superhuman perseverance. It immediately reminds people of the shocking bombing case at Hongkou Park in Shanghai thirteen years ago. On April 29th of the 21st year of the Republic of China (1932), Kim Gu's "slaughter the Japanese" policy achieved its greatest success.

No one can forget this time of exceptional achievement. Shirakawa returned to his country in a coffin after being injured in the explosion, Consul General Shigemitsu lost a leg, and Admiral Nomura became one-eyed.

Chairman Chiang is a Great Leader

Shanghai occupies an important position in the history of the Korean revolution. The first Korean Provisional Government was initially organized in Shanghai. Other underground anti-Japanese activities were also first planned in Shanghai. In the past, our government and the Kuomintang continuously provided assistance to Korean revolutionary patriots, so Mr. Kim said to reporters very sincerely: "Chairman Chiang is a great leader and a good friend of Korea!"

Mr. Kim faces many difficult problems upon returning to his country this time. Although Korea has now been liberated, it is still under Soviet-American military occupation. Because the two sides cannot compromise with each other, it has laid the foundation for a crisis of direct conflict. Mr. Kim told reporters: "We are returning to our country this time at the invitation of the US military authorities, using our personal connections to seek the unification of Korea."

Striving for Independence and Freedom Through Our Own Efforts

The 38th parallel has now become the dividing line between North and South Korea; South Korea, under US military occupation, includes Gyeongsang North and South, Jeolla North and South, Chungcheong North and South, and Gangwon provinces. This is Korea's agricultural area, with a population of over 20 million, accounting for two-thirds of the total Korean population. North Korea is an industrial area, currently under Soviet rule. It has the largest hydroelectric power plant, chemical plant, textile factory, fertilizer factory, airplane manufacturing plant, military industrial plant, and gold mines. Since agriculture and industry have been divided into two military and political regions with no communication, farmers in South Korea feel panic about industrial products, while workers in North Korea are extremely short of food and other agricultural products.

Mr. Kim clearly understands the complexity of these issues and that they cannot be resolved in a short period. He said: "We hope that a proper solution can be produced within the framework of the United Nations so that Korea can achieve the sovereignty it has been fighting for for more than 30 years." After returning to Korea, in addition to assisting the US military authorities in implementing administrative affairs as an advisor, he also hopes to convene a national congress of all Korean political parties in a short period to realize constitutional government.

Ensuring Appropriate Solutions to People's Livelihood Issues

The Korean Provisional Government includes five political parties: the Korean Independence Party, the Korean National Revolutionary Party, the New Korea Democratic Party, the Korean National Liberation Alliance, and the Korean Anarchist Federation. The leader of the Korean Independence Party is Kim Gu, which is currently the strongest political party. The second strongest is the National Revolutionary Party, led by Kim Kyu-sik, the Vice-Chairman of the Korean Provisional Government. In Korea itself, there are also the Democratic Party and the Committee for National Construction, which have considerable influence in Korea. At the same time, the Communist Party, under Soviet occupation, is naturally raising its head. The important task that Kim Gu is currently burdened with is to promote cooperation between all parties and factions, so that the political parties will join hands and move towards unification. Secondly, he needs to find ways to solve the problems of food, clothing, and housing for the Korean people. Kim Gu's hope is to establish a peaceful and unified Korea and make it a cornerstone of peace in the Far East. (Written by Tonggang for Kim Gu)

Education and Sports

### Ministry of Education to Implement the Second Phase of National Education Starting in January Next Year

Eliminating Illiteracy Thoroughly, Regardless of Rear Areas or Recovered Areas

[Chongqing Airmail from Dahuashe] The first phase of the National Education Plan implemented by the Ministry of Education will expire at the end of this year. The second phase of National Education implementation has now been planned, and notifications are being sent to education departments and bureaus in recovered areas and provinces and cities in the rear area to implement it starting in January next year.

[Chongqing Airmail from This Newspaper] The Ministry of Education has ordered all provinces and cities in the recovered areas to step up the implementation of national education and thoroughly eliminate illiteracy. According to the implementation guidelines, national education is divided into two parts: "compulsory education" and "remedial education for illiterate people." It should be implemented simultaneously in the National Primary Schools and Township (Town) Central Schools, and the compulsory education part should be enriched as soon as possible. All school-age children aged six to twelve should receive four, two, or one year of compulsory education, except for those who may receive six years of primary school education. Illiterate people aged fifteen to forty-five should also receive primary or advanced public remedial education in stages, but it should first be implemented for men and women aged fifteen to thirty-five, and then continue to older people. Illiterate children aged twelve to fifteen may be given appropriate compulsory education or remedial education for illiterate people, depending on the actual local situation and their physical and mental development. This national education has been implemented in the Great Rear Area for many years. The people of the recovered areas should follow the guidelines and supplement the implementation of this national education.

### Registration for Temporary University Preparatory Classes Begins

According to the person in charge of the Temporary University Office yesterday: Registration for the Temporary University preparatory classes has now begun. Among the students reporting, there are more from Jiaotong University, about one hundred, followed by more than two hundred from the National Medical College, more than one hundred and fifty from the Shanghai Business College, more than one hundred from the Conservatory of Music, seventy from the German Medical College, and only more than ten from Lei Shude. It is also heard that Minister Zhu will discuss future school administration policies and the hiring of professors after the registration procedures for the Qianming Temporary University preparatory classes are completed.

### Ministry of Education Plans to Utilize Enemy Buildings to Establish Various Educational Facilities

[Chongqing Airmail from Dahuashe] The Ministry of Education recently stated that the establishment of various educational facilities in major cities in the past has always suffered from the lack of suitable addresses, and many have been forced to compromise. Since the Japanese invaders entered, the number of immigrants has increased, scattered in key locations, or established schools at all levels to educate their overseas Chinese, or established various institutions to implement governance. The buildings and houses are distributed in various cities. Now that the enemy and puppets have withdrawn, their buildings can be used as much as possible, considering what is appropriate, to establish various educational facilities. The planned method is as follows: (1) If the location is suitable and meets the needs, the school will still be a school, the group library will still be a library, and the reading room will still be a reading room. (2) If the old school site, old library, etc. are not suitable, they can be moved to suitable houses built by the enemy. (3) The ministry will transfer the order to the Executive Yuan to inform the receiving agencies and local officials to give priority to educational administrative agencies and provide all conveniences.

### Chenyou Cup Basketball, A Main Battle in Group A, Hualian Beats Donghua

Overseas Chinese Lost to Desheng

Since the start of the Chenyou Cup basketball game, the game between Hualian and Donghua in Group A yesterday was the most exciting. No less than a thousand fans came upon hearing the news. Fortunately, the Zhongqing authorities imposed absolute restrictions on the sale of tickets and asked the military and police to maintain order at the venue, so the order was very good. The results of the two games are as follows:

Desheng—Overseas Chinese (Group A) 26—21 Hualian—Donghua (Group A) 50—28

The Desheng vs. Overseas Chinese Battle

The Desheng vs. Overseas Chinese battle took the stage first. The strengths of the two teams were similar, and the scores rose and fell, each refusing to give way. At the end of the first half, Desheng won by one goal with a score of 10 to 8. In the second half, Desheng adopted a rotational warfare tactic, frequently changing players. This method proved effective, and Overseas Chinese eventually lost to Desheng, with a score of 26 to 21.

Hualian Wins with Wisdom

After the end of the previous game, Donghua and Hualian took the stage, and the audience's spirits were greatly lifted. Li Zhenzhong, the main player of Hualian, made a mistake, and Hualian took the opportunity to rise. Kong Guangyi and Quanchang each had wonderful shots, taking the advantage of 4-0 and 8-2 in an instant. After that, Donghua actively counterattacked and gradually saw signs of progress, but it was still difficult to exceed the advantage. At the end of the first half, Hualian took the lead with a score of 21 to 16.

After the rest, Hualian played steadily, looking for openings to score. Donghua still relied on a surge of blood and rushed around, causing the forbidden door to open wide. Hualian's score gradually increased. The biggest difference was 38-20. Donghua still fought like a trapped lion, and Li Chongyouliang had another masterpiece, but time was not on its side, and it was still no match for Hualian. In the end, Hualian won with a score of 50 to 28.

### Building New Educational Authority (Continued from Yesterday)

— Dong Renjian

The system is often the remnants of various past educational activities. Its institutions can no longer adapt to the current social needs, but it continues to maintain its vested interests, exerting great power and becoming an obstacle to improving education: If "education is life," the nature of the school should change, and grades, academic years, academic performance, and credits should add more meaning. Since the school is not an "ivory tower," why can't it be integrated with society? Why can't education and politics be used for each other? Why should students' activities be divided into in-class and out-of-class? Why can't teaching and learning be combined? What is the task of the tutor? What is the role of testing? Do we want to take the university entrance exam? What should we test? What can we get from the exam? We want to inspect and supervise: but how to inspect? How to observe? How to supervise? How to guide? You must know that new eight-legged essays, new private schools, and new pedantic teachers are all authorities everywhere, and as a result, they only waste children, waste young people, and waste life—waste their precious time, energy, habits, emotions, knowledge, and will!

The mission of current educators: Overthrow the old educational authority and quickly build up the new educational authority!

### The United States Will Ship Materials to China, Prices Will Generally Decline, and the Coal Shortage Problem Is Expected to Be Solved

Two Groups Hosted the Chengdu Journalists' Delegation Yesterday

The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce and the Shanghai Local Association hosted the Chengdu Journalists' Delegation at the Pudong Fellow Villagers Association at 6:00 p.m. yesterday. More than 200 leaders from industrial, commercial, and journalistic circles attended. Du Yuesheng and Wang Xiaolai delivered welcome speeches successively and discussed various issues. After four hours of talks, important reports were made on prices, coal, shop assistant life, and factory resumption.

Shanghai Prices Begin to Decline

Han Xiao, a journalist from Chengdu, raised (1) the price issue and (2) the factory resumption issue. Xu Jiyin replied briefly: Chairman Chiang telegraphed Mr. Du Yuesheng, asking him to use the power of social justice in Shanghai to stop the price increase. After Mr. Du invited leaders from all walks of life and deliberated several times, he curbed the increase on the one hand and dredged transportation on the other. Today, great results have been seen, and the prices of various daily necessities have fallen sharply. The gold market has also plummeted. In the future, the downward trend will continue, and the livelihoods of five million citizens can be slightly restored. As for factory resumption, it has been decided that regardless of how the property rights of each factory are, they should all start work immediately and engage in production. In addition, Lu Jingshi has tried many ways to relieve unemployed workers.

A Large Number of Materials Are Coming to China

Next, Liu Hongsheng reported: After President Song came to Shanghai and ordered a quick solution to the coal shortage problem, coal is now being transported south one after another. Due to transportation and security conditions at the place of origin, the output has been reduced by three-quarters. It is now being transported from various sources. From next month, it will be available for Shanghai's production power. In addition, transportation is also an important issue in stabilizing prices. After the war, due to the suspension of foreign merchant ships, the number of ships accounted for 75% of the pre-war number. Only Chinese merchant ships remained, which felt scarce. It has now been decided to purchase 30 US Liberty ships, each with 9,000 tons, and 18 sea-going ships, each with 3,000 to 5,000 tons, are also being negotiated for purchase. What is most sufficient for the people of Shanghai to be informed of is that 90 US ships, 32 of which are fully loaded with flour and wheat, are naval vessels and are equipped with houses for US troops to land and other daily necessities, will arrive in China. This is greatly related to the supply of Chinese materials. It is also helpful for stabilizing prices in Shanghai in the future.

Cheng Cangbo Sympathizes with Shop Assistants

Next, Cheng Cangbo, a guidance member of the Xinwen Bao, raised the issue of equal treatment for shop employees and the issue of Shanghai banks closing at 3:00 p.m., hoping that the industries would pay attention to it. The manager of the Guohuo Company replied that the six major companies have unified methods, and the monthly salary for employees starts from 8,500 yuan. Next, Xu Jiyin replied about bank service hours and treatment: 3,700 yuan for trainees for less than one year, 5,000 yuan for more than two years, 7,200 yuan for probationary employees for more than three years, and 8,600 yuan for junior employees. He also said that bank treatment is also very ordinary.

Du Yuesheng Delivers a Welcome Speech

Then, Du Yuesheng delivered a welcome speech, saying that during the war, Sichuan Province supported the national human and material resources, and the press expounded the great righteousness of the country and the nation, expressing a warm welcome to the journalists' delegation to Shanghai for investigation. Cha Xiupan of the Sino-US Daily News hoped that Du and Wang would be able to host the press at any time, so that the hard work of local leaders in serving the community would be known to all walks of life. Du and Wang expressed their willingness to actively communicate in the future.

Pan Gongzhan is Concerned About Production

Next, at the urging of Wang Xiaolai, Pan Gongzhan, a guidance member of the Shen Bao, stood up to deliver a speech. He first said that he happened to be in Chengdu on the day of victory, and he knew all walks of life and the press in Chengdu. After returning to Peidu and then Shanghai, he had been engaged in journalism in the past, and now he has re-enlisted after many years. He was very happy to meet the Chengdu press here today. Pan then said that in order to seek the balanced development of industries in various places in the future, he hoped that the factory owners would continue production in Sichuan Province. Finally, Yan Duhe and others delivered speeches respectively, expressing their admiration for the contributions of the Chengdu press during the war.

Shanghai Council Members Suggest Eight Items

National Council members in Shanghai, Xi Yushu, Tao Baizhou, etc., sent a joint telegram to Song Yaolun, President of the Executive Yuan, and Vice President Weng, regarding the price problem in this city, suggesting eight items: (1) It is appropriate to increase the allocation of navigation equipment to facilitate freight transport. (2) Step up the mining work of each mine. (3) The enemy and puppet materials should be unsealed and sold at low prices. (4) The enemy and puppet factories should be transferred to private operation as soon as possible. (5) The government should give reasonable financial support to private industries. (6) The government should核 supply foreign exchange head positions at reasonable prices as much as possible. (7) The method of collecting and redeeming pseudo-currency urgently needs to be improved. (8) It is necessary to increase production and expand sources as much as possible to relieve the people's difficulties.

Price Stabilization Will Be Discussed Again

Du Yuesheng, chairman of the Shanghai Local Association, has been exchanging opinions with leaders from all walks of life and discussing effective ways to stabilize prices since receiving the order from Chairman Chiang. According to Mr. Du's statement to our reporter last night, he plans to convene representatives from various industries again in one or two days to discuss detailed plans. It is rumored that Mr. Du has organized a five-person committee to stabilize prices, which is said to be inaccurate.

### Improving the Handling of Pseudo-Currency, Deciding to Increase Redemption Agencies, Those Who Are Willing to Redeem on Behalf Can Contact the Bank of China

The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce previously suggested three points to the Ministry of Finance to improve the method of handling pseudo-currency: (1) Please increase the redemption agencies. Any bank that has been approved by the ministry to continue operating, the Central Bank may entrust to redeem on behalf. (2) The banks that redeem on behalf shall open a national currency deposit account in proportion to the pseudo-currency received, and withdraw funds by bill or by draw as needed. (3) Please reiterate the explicit order that pseudo-currency is temporarily allowed to circulate. The Ministry of Finance replied to the above two points, in principle, it can be approved, and the association shall directly negotiate with the Central Bank Shanghai to handle it. Before the deadline for the redemption of the third point of pseudo-currency, it could originally circulate in the market, and the association should inform all industries to be aware of it. After receiving the telegram, the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce has appointed standing director Jin Runxiang and supervisor Luo Qinghua to negotiate with the Central Bank Shanghai. It is heard that after the issuance bureau of the Central Bank received the telegram order at the same time, it has yesterday sent a letter to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to inform all banks and money shops that those who are willing to redeem on behalf should come to the bank to handle the procedures. The Municipal Chamber of Commerce has sent letters to the two public associations of banks and money shops, and quickly notified the member banks and money shops.

Small Denomination Legal Tender Should Be Accepted Unconditionally

The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce received a letter from the Finance and Finance Special Commissioner's Office of the Ministry of Finance stationed in the Beijing-Shanghai area. Recently, banks have refused to accept 5 yuan and 10 yuan small denomination legal tender, which is very inappropriate. In addition to 公吿 and ordering the two public associations of banks and money shops to inform each bank, all legal tender face value shall be accepted unconditionally, regardless of size, and shall not be discriminated against, and hope to inform all merchants to comply with it.

Redemption Procedures Will Be Changed

The improved pseudo-currency redemption procedures will be implemented from the first of next month. According to a report from the Dagang News Agency, the Issuance Bureau of the Central Bank held a special meeting at No. 15 Bund yesterday morning for this purpose, and is now formulating methods. The characteristics of the revised methods will be that each bank can transfer pseudo-currency, but there are many abuses that may occur due to the transfer. Therefore, it is now being carefully studied.

### No Special Permits Required for Imported Goods, Simplified Procedures for Exported Goods, Application Forms Still Required

[Special Report from This Newspaper] During the Anti-Japanese War, in order to control resources, the government promulgated measures for obtaining licenses and reporting the transportation of imported and exported goods. On March 13th of this year, it was revised and promulgated again. Now that the Anti-Japanese War has been won, these control measures have been resolved. There are no special import permit requirements for imported goods. Although export goods still require continued procedures, in order to facilitate merchants, the procedures are simplified as much as possible. Except for the application forms, which should still be used, all other matters are abolished. Therefore, the Ministry of Finance has issued a circular to all provinces and cities, officially abolishing the above-mentioned revised measures for obtaining licenses and reporting the transportation of specially permitted imported goods.

### Gold Prices Plunge, Down 50,000 Yuan, Securities and Foreign Currencies Follow

The market price of gold in Shanghai was already abnormally high compared to the British and American markets. Recently, with the abundant supply from the wartime capital Chongqing and the gradual opening of shipping, cash has become very tight, leading to a gradual decline. Yesterday, prices plummeted. Yesterday, merchants from all over the country who were handling goods were dumping actual goods. Speculators who had borrowed money were at their wits' end and had to reluctantly liquidate. The entire day was one-sided. The opening price immediately fell to 813,000 yuan, and soon broke through the 800,000 yuan mark. In the middle of the day, trading was sluggish, with little progress. By noon, prices were still struggling around 785,000 yuan. Speculators finally felt panic and scrambled to liquidate, causing prices to fall sharply throughout the afternoon. In the end, prices were down by 50,000 yuan compared to the previous day. This was the result of the collapse of speculators after days of weakness. The government's efforts to lower prices also had an impact. The long-awaited listing by the Central Bank has not yet materialized, and buyers seemed to have given up hope. However, after the sharp decline, caution should be exercised to prevent a rebound. Silver shops continuously lowered the price of gold ornaments to 83,000 yuan. The price of silver dollars continued to fall, but the decline was still limited. The last price was 430 yuan. The listed price of silver bullion was also reduced to 700 yuan.

After struggling for many days, the foreign currency market also collapsed yesterday. The US dollar fell from 1,370 yuan at the beginning of the morning and never recovered, finally breaking through the 1,300 yuan mark. The Hong Kong dollar also seemed like a frightened bird, rushing to sell off, except for the 1930 issue, which declined slightly. As a result, the US dollar fell by 70 yuan, the 1936 and 1937 Hong Kong dollars fell by 5 yuan, the 1930 issue fell by 20 yuan, the Australian pound fell by 3,100 yuan to 3,400 yuan, and the Rupee fell by 280 yuan to 330 yuan. The black market discount suddenly loosened yesterday, because speculators had been idle for a long time and the way out was still blocked. In the end, it retreated to within one and a half jiao.

Public bonds rebounded yesterday. Professionals took profits and sold off. Amid the cries of plummeting prices, non-professionals did not dare to inquire again, forming a supply-over-demand situation. As a result, prices fell by 20 to 30 yuan compared to the previous day. It seems that the difference will still be squeezed.

Chinese stocks were also affected by gold and bond prices, and buying interest declined. As a result, prices fell by half a percent to ten percent. The outlook is not optimistic. The news of resumption of operations cannot be realized in a short period of time. Retail investors have weak staying power, which has led to this situation. Yesterday, amid the weakness of gold prices, people were weak and major investors were watching, with few inquiries, while retail short sellers were active. As a result, prices are trending downward, and the trend seems to be changing.

Yesterday, large-cap foreign stocks seemed to be disintegrating, with significant declines and no buyers. Small-cap stocks fell but were still stable, but supply still exceeded demand.

### Pigments Have Orders

Pigments from Sichuan Province are slightly declining, with White Water Beach indigo powder dyeing surface ash, Kuai Kuai indigo, vermilion from Jiangxi Province are slightly declining black indigo powder, and other provincial pigments have not shown fatigue. As for the needs of local factories, there is actually an increase, but because foreign firms in this city have received foreign orders, actual sales are sluggish. However, after inquiring with the dyeing and weaving industry, they said that the delivery dates for the orders received by a few foreign firms are not fixed and the procedures take a long time, so the future situation is worth considering.

### Sichuan Sales Rise, Cash Shortage, Prices Show Contradictory Signs

Recently, general prices have risen less and fallen more, and the market shows signs of leveling off. After inquiring with the financial community, credit is not very tight, but there is a shortage of cash. It is found that funds are flowing inward, going to various villages to purchase agricultural products. According to general observations, the shortage of cash is unlikely to be resolved in a short time. Therefore, cotton yarn, grain, etc. were all weak yesterday and are not easy to be optimistic about. However, Sichuan sales goods are rising due to smooth shipping between Shanghai and Chongqing. Once they are mobilized, they are all reported to be rising, creating a contradictory situation for a time. Details are recorded below:

Cotton Yarn Falls: Cotton yarn fell along with gold prices. Buyers are watching and not moving forward. Supply from all parties is very strong, and the ships loaded with goods by Sichuan and Hankou merchants have already departed. Demand is slightly sluggish, causing the price of coarse and fine yarn to fall by 20,000 yuan. Moreover, American cotton has arrived in Shanghai, and the market is small, so the footing is unstable.

Rice Falls: The source of rice is still strong, sales are sluggish, and prices continue to fall by 500 to 600 yuan. Medium-grade goods fell by 700 yuan. White rice also fell by 500 yuan. Flour is slow to move, and also fell by 100 to 200 yuan. Oil: There is a lot of oil coming from Bengbu, and the price has fallen by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan. Raw peanuts fell by 1,000 yuan. Soybeans fell by 300 to 400 yuan. Corn lacks prosperity. The supply of all grains is greater than demand, and there is still little optimism.

Silk Prices Fall: Yesterday, the silk market entered the eight-point range due to gold prices, and people's hearts were weakened. Only a few loads were transacted, and the decline was strong. Ordinary factory silk opened at 670,000 to 700,000 yuan per load, a drop of 100,000 yuan. Another five loads were sold for 750,000 yuan. High-end factory silk is expected to be exported in the future, so the decline is small, selling for 1 million to another 50,000 yuan. Jili silk lacked trading and the market was quiet.

Lead Falls: The trend of lead is that users such as can factories and paint factories are purchasing sporadically, so the market is stable and weak, currently shouting around 30,000 yuan. As for type lead, cultural institutions are buying, and the trend is stable, shouting sales of 36,000 to 37,000 yuan.

Hardware Rises: Yesterday, the hardware market situation showed a slight turnaround. Although transactions by local factories still did not improve, the guest sales side showed a prosperous atmosphere. For example, Chongqing merchants have a very rich demand. The goods they purchase, such as round nails, white lead wire, white lead skin, and tinplate, are all being packed and exported in large quantities. The Shanghai-Chongqing shipping line is now smooth, and exchanges are frequent. The two places can help each other out of their difficulties, which is a good phenomenon for the hardware industry after the victory.

### Grocery Market Resumes

The Sugar, North and South Grocery Joint Market is jointly organized by nine Rongtong groups: the sugar industry, the northern goods industry, the seafood industry, the southern goods industry, the cooked food industry, the longan industry, the exchange industry, the sesame vine industry, and the beeswax industry. It built its own Western-style building at 67 Zhonghua Road in Nanshi, with a very grand format. The director, Ge Weian, and other staff members were publicly recommended by the various associations. After Nanshi fell, it moved to 23 Tongyun Street in the former French Concession. Now that the country has been restored, the original site has been refurbished and moved back to its old location for trading.

### Two Ways to Withdraw US Bank Deposits

According to reliable information from Shanghai, the US government has recently decided on a method for dealing with the problem of Chinese people's deposits frozen in US banks. Deposits of US$500 or less can be withdrawn freely at any time. As for deposits of more than US$500, depositors who apply for it can also withdraw them in the same way, in order to facilitate the capital activities of our Chinese people.

### Fuel Difficulties

The coal market seems to be hovering at its peak. Buyers are turning weak and watching because coal prices have risen too much in recent days. Transactions are sparse, but the sales of bituminous coal powder are still active. Firewood arrives mostly wet, and prices are slightly stable and weak, but there are still many transactions.

### The Harvest of the Anti-Japanese War

— Huang Jiayin

During the eight years of the Anti-Japanese War, China can be said to have benefited from misfortune in many aspects. In terms of foreign affairs, China jumped from a semi-colony to one of the four major powers due to its victory in the Anti-Japanese War. In terms of domestic affairs, the several major migrations of the government, educational and cultural institutions, and the people during the Anti-Japanese War have made the people of various parts of China more aware of each other, and made China a truly unified country.

Personally, I have been to the rear area twice. The first time was through Hong Kong to Guilin, where I stayed for a short period of time; the second time was through Heliujieshou to Chongqing, where I lived for a longer period of time. If it were not for this Anti-Japanese War, it would be simply unimaginable for the people of China's coastal metropolises to move to Guangxi and Sichuan in groups.

People who go to the interior for the first time probably have the feeling of "city people going to the countryside." Especially people who grow up in the environment of a metropolis lack the opportunity to contact the majority of the real Chinese people and land, and they do not have a correct understanding of their country. In the minds of people who have not been to the interior, the impression of China is probably mostly derived from textbooks. I dare to guarantee that this is very different from the actual situation. This is the so-called "seeing is believing."

I feel that one of the greatest gains of this Anti-Japanese War is that the Chinese people have a more accurate understanding of their country. This is of great benefit to the future of the country and the nation.

### Remembering People

— Jia Shui

Recently, I often think of a British social worker I once knew slightly.

It's Miss Mary Oliver. She was born into a wealthy family. When she was young, she went out with her nanny and passed through the East End of London. The car suddenly broke down and stopped for repairs. The nanny told her not to move around, lest she get infected with the turbid breath of the slum and get sick. This gave her a great feeling. She was a human being too, and she shouldn't stay there for even a minute. What about the men, women, old, and children who live there all day, all night, all month, and all year round? After she grew up, she gave up her comfortable and honorable life as a young lady and became a social worker. She used her family's property to establish Kingsley Hall in the East End of London, which was dedicated to serving the workers and the working masses there.

She had been to China, and not just once. The one time I knew about was in the spring of 1938. She investigated the facts of the Japanese manufacturing and selling red pills and white pills and other poisons in Northeast China and North China, and made a detailed report to the Japanese people, the British government, and people all over the world. She was such an "external" person, managing things that were not her own. She sympathized with the Indian independence movement, helped the movement with words and writing, and was a friend of Gandhi.

Now that the war is over, she wrote to me, encouraging me to be the Gandhi of China. I'm afraid I'm not a person who lives up to her high expectations, but I can't help but miss this gray-haired lady, admire her life's development, admire her spirit of selflessness and self-sacrifice that flows out everywhere unexpectedly, and her extremely broad sympathy for the oppressed who seek freedom and happiness.

### Hitler Falls for a Honey Trap

— Jin Chun

In the past, we have heard stories about Hitler and his lovers, but we did not know that one of his lovers was a spy, and this spy was actually sent by the Soviet Union. I think that even the German leader who fell for the honey trap was dreaming, even though we didn't know it before. This news was recently revealed by the Soviet side.

Olga Tschechowa was born in the Caucasus. Her husband's name is Leiber. Tschechowa slipped into Germany in 1921 and became a famous movie star. Soon, she became Hitler's closest girlfriend. During the war, she served as a spy for the Soviet Union, probing the reality of Germany. When a group of German tycoons wanted to ask Hitler for something, they mostly asked her to intercede, and she recorded this information in a gold-boxed notebook and sent it secretly to Moscow by her chauffeur.

When the Soviet army besieged Berlin, Tschechowa was hiding in a certain air-raid shelter. When Berlin fell, she was rescued by a Soviet colonel and escorted back to Moscow.

The bottom of the ocean cannot be photographed with a camera, which has always been a regret for researchers in geology and marine biology. However, a camera that specializes in photographing the ocean has recently been invented. It has a device that emits electricity and a special motor that automatically takes a picture when it touches the bottom of the sea.

With the progress of medicine, it is now possible to remove eggs from the human body, fertilize them outside the body, let them mature, and observe the first two cell divisions.

A serum for preventing paralysis has been successfully tested and has been tested on some animals.

Medical scientists studying the fluorescence emitted by the white matter in the human brain have discovered a medium called plaque. It is said that this discovery reveals a new dawn for the treatment of nerves.

Literature

### Talking About Books (1)

— Wei Feng

According to the editor, Free Talk is willing to have a little space every Saturday to let me talk specifically about newly published books, and limited to Western books. I think this is probably useful for friends in Shanghai; because we have been blockaded for so long, even though we can still get new books published abroad, it's still a good thing to hear the news first.

It is also difficult to see new foreign books in the so-called rear area. Because of the convenience of my work, I see more, but it is still too narrow and too biased. Therefore, in the future, it will inevitably be limited to "one eye."

During the war, the British and American publishing industries did not have much restrictions. At the same time, because price controls were effective, the cost of living in the United Kingdom has only increased by 20%, and the United States only 12%. The purchasing power of the general public has not weakened, and the sales of good books are still strong. Several books have sold more than two to three million copies last year alone.

I now assume that each time I introduce a book, the nature is unlimited, but when I write, literary works will definitely be more. Each time I plan to write only about 500 words. If readers send in short essays about books, or have any opinions to offer, I think the editor and I would be very welcome.

Short Masterpiece

### The Enemy (3)

— Pearl S. Buck, translated by Zhu Qi

"He's injured," Sadao exclaimed. He hurried closer to the man, who lay motionless, his face buried in the sand. An old hat on his head was soaked in seawater. He was wearing broken, wet clothes. Sadao squatted down beside him and turned the man's face around. They saw that face.

"A white man!" Hana whispered.

Yes, this was a white man. The wet hat fell off, revealing his wet blond hair, which was very long, as if it had not been cut for several weeks. His young, painful face was covered with a disheveled blond beard. He was unconscious and had no idea what they were doing.

Now Sadao remembered the wound, and he searched for it skillfully. Blood flowed from the place he touched. Sadao saw a gunshot wound on the lower right back of the man, which had burst open again. The skin and flesh there had been blackened by gunpowder. This man had been shot a few days ago, and the wound had not been treated. Unfortunately, the rock was pressing on the wound.

"Oh, he's bleeding really badly!" Hana said softly and solemnly again. Now the fog had completely covered them, and at this moment, no one would pass by here again. The fishermen had already gone home, and even those who occasionally passed by to pick up floating objects on the beach thought the day was over.

"What shall we do with him?" Sadao said to himself. But his trained hands, as if of their own volition, were doing their best to stop the man's bleeding. He bandaged the wound with seaweed from the beach. The man groaned in a coma, but did not wake up.

"We'd better send him back to the sea." Sadao said, answering his own words.

Now that the blood had stopped, Sadao stood up and patted the sand off his hands.

"Yes, that would naturally be best," Hana said calmly. But she continued to stare at the motionless man.

Sadao said, "If we take a white man into our house, we will be arrested. If we turn him over as a prisoner, he will surely die."

In her heart: "The most merciful thing is to put him back into the sea." But neither of them moved. They looked at the lifeless body with curiosity and disgust.

### Social Services: Future Working Guidelines; Advocating for Seven Social Undertakings

— Ji Ping

Student Aid Funds Remain the Focus of Work; Wishing for Guidance from Social Elites

The re-publication of this newspaper and the daily meetings with our beloved readers are truly a great joy. The expectations that everyone places on us are both profound and sincere, and naturally, our commitment to serving everyone should be equally far-reaching. For example, concerning "Social Services," there are truly countless things we should and want to do, and it's hard to know where to start. I recall that the establishment of the "Social Services Department" of this newspaper was still three years ago, precisely during the period of full-scale war and the decline of people's livelihoods. My colleagues, while diligently holding their posts, devoted their spare energy to six relief projects. Although no special effects were seen, it was merely an attempt to fulfill the responsibility of advocacy. Now, the War of Resistance has been won, the sun has shone again, and everything is waiting to be rebuilt. This is truly the initial stage of restoration and construction. The colleagues of this department have always regarded serving society as their mission, and they are willing to exert their meager efforts, following behind the readers, and do their best. However, my colleagues have limited talent and abilities. I sincerely hope that social elites will often provide guidance to correct any shortcomings!

In the past, this newspaper specially established a "Social Services Department" and a "Reader Student Aid Fund Office," dividing labor and cooperating to do their best. From now on, these two departments will be merged into one, called the "Social Services Section." The working guidelines are briefly described as follows: (1) Reader Student Aid Fund... In accordance with the past student aid purposes, providing assistance to poor, talented, and out-of-school youth, and cultivating talent for the country, this task is the focus of the department's work.

(2) Orphan Education Aid Fund... Rescuing orphans without parents and homeless street children, providing appropriate education so they can become useful people.

(3) Medical Aid Fund... Providing relief to the generally poor and sick, providing medical treatment and medicine, and guiding them towards health and happiness.

(4) Student Health Check-up... Specially contracting with major hospitals to provide physical examinations for aided students and treat illnesses.

(5) Small Loan Fund... Providing loans to unemployed poor people to run small businesses, giving them the opportunity to make a living, repaying the principal in installments, without interest.

(6) Maternity Aid Fund... Helping poor pregnant women, providing free delivery, and providing guidance on prenatal and postnatal hygiene and infant care knowledge. The greatest virtue of heaven and earth is life, so this aid fund has the highest intention of protecting mothers and children.

(7) Martial Arts Training... Promoting public sports, advancing national health, specially inviting experts to provide guidance, without any fees.

In summary, we are willing to work tirelessly and do our best. We hope that the public will provide material assistance and spiritual encouragement. Let us all join hands and move forward on the road of serving society!
