### Japanese Army Garrison Unit Launches Bayonet Attack; Commander of Tarakan Dies in Battle

Southern Front Base, 7th (Central News Agency Telegram) – The Japanese garrison unit on Tarakan Island has been engaging the enemy's powerful landing force for days, launching bayonet attacks, increasing the enemy's casualties. On April 25th, when the Japanese army's suicide squad launched a fierce attack on the enemy, the highest commander of the American landing force, Lieutenant General Serisi, was shot in the abdomen and died in battle.

Southern Front Base, 7th (Central News Agency Telegram) – Since the enemy landed on Tarakan, Himaat-kun, a member of the local volunteer force who has been advancing with the Japanese soldiers and fighting actively on the front lines, carried explosives and charged into an enemy machine gun position during a night attack on May 21st, destroying it and fulfilling his final aspiration. On the 3rd, the Supreme Commander of the Southern Navy praised his meritorious deeds and announced them to the entire army.

### Fierce Fighting Continues in the Davao Area

### The Tragic Spirit of the Japanese Special Attack Corps

Tokyo, 7th (Central News Agency Telegram) – Oahira Takayoshi, director of the Domei News Agency's editorial department, visited various special attack bases for a week and returned to Tokyo on the 6th. According to his account of the heroic situation at each base, special attack planes that will never return are sent to Okinawa every day. The members of the special attack corps who board the "Shinryu" are calm and composed. These members all firmly believe that air power will win, and that certain death and a certain hit are the foundation of victory. I once heard the commander's instructions before departure, and his tragic spirit was deeply engraved in my heart. We were born in Japan, inheriting 2,600 years of brilliant history, and we must continue this ancestral history forever. The history of tomorrow depends on us to create. We must not disgrace our ancestors, but follow in the footsteps of the loyal Nanmasasue and march forward boldly. The members of the special attack corps have no doubts, only believing that loyalty will win, and persevering to the end. Each base has a self-sufficient system, and everyone from the commander to the military personnel is working hard to fight and produce at the same time.

### The Chongqing Army Newly Establishes the Jiangsu and Zhejiang War Zones

Editorial

### Painful Lessons: On the United Nations Agreement on Partitioning and Governing Germany

The four countries of Britain, the United States, the Soviet Union, and France signed an agreement in Berlin on the 5th of this month on partitioning and governing Germany. The full text has been published in yesterday's newspaper. After patiently and meticulously studying this so-called "historical document," the impression we gained, apart from the word "tyranny," could not find a more appropriate term. It is clear that this is another "masterpiece" of British and American imperialism. Considering that the United Nations has, for several years, unanimously criticized the "tyrannical politics" of the German Nazi Party, is there any difference between this kind of partitioning and governing method and what the Germans did in the occupied territories for several years? The British themselves have the proverb of "history is the most stubborn." What a pungent irony this "historical document" is to the British and Americans, who are full of maintaining world peace and security and posing as liberators!

Policies of tyranny and revenge can never solve international political problems. This has been repeatedly proven throughout thousands of years of history. It is unexpected that in this twentieth century, in the so-called civilized powers of Britain, the United States, the Soviet Union, and France, there is such a German scheme that violates human reason, which is surprising! The motive for this tyrannical policy of the United Nations authorities may be, as their communiqué stated, to permanently eliminate the revival of German militarism and achieve the ideal of maintaining world peace and security; but the opposite is true, and the result is not peace and security, but a new war crisis! Now the German people, under the threat of the enemy, certainly cannot but bow their heads and endure for the time being, but every German who has the courageous blood of their ancestors flowing through them will never endure humiliation for long!

What is even more serious is that at the time of implementing this plan to punish the defeated country, which is based only on power and violence, at the time of knowing only how to seize rights and not hesitating to completely betray its oath, the conflict between Britain, the United States, the Soviet Union, and France themselves has developed in the Polish issue, in the Near East issue, and in the San Francisco Conference! What is in store for those who inflict tyranny is not only the targets of their tyranny, but also the perpetrators themselves! Although the call for a three- or four-way meeting between Truman, Churchill, and Stalin is growing louder and louder, and they are trying to eliminate this crisis, judging from the stalemate at the San Francisco Conference and the recent resurgence of anti-Soviet flames in Britain and the United States, even if such a meeting is held, it will not have any results.

The tyrannical plan for dealing with Germany can only have one possible effect on us Eastern nations, and that is to make every Eastern nation realize that Asians are the masters of Asia. Under this painful lesson, we will more strongly encourage the self-esteem of our Eastern nations, and encourage our Eastern nations to strengthen unity with China and Japan as the center, in order to fulfill the purpose of Asia for Asians.

### Fierce Battles Between the Two Armies on Okinawa Island; Japanese Air Force Active; Enemy Seems to Be Preparing for the Next Attack

Ryukyu Islands Base, 7th (Central News Agency Telegram) – The Japanese Air Force launched a fierce attack on an enemy ship in the waters off Okinawa on the night of the 5th. After further investigation, it was learned that the Japanese planes carried out close-range bayonet warfare and fierce aerial torpedo attacks on three unidentified enemy ships. On the 6th, Japanese planes again fiercely attacked enemy ships in the sea south of the island. Several groups of enemy ships gradually approached the vicinity of the southern part of the island, carrying out naval gun fire on the Japanese army's positions. Japanese and American forces are engaged in fierce battles. On June 1st, the number of enemy planes attacking the entire island's front line totaled more than one hundred and several dozen, showing an active state.

Tokyo, 7th (Central News Agency Telegram) – As the battle line on Okinawa Island is gradually moving south, the ground fighting is becoming more intense. The enemy forces that landed on the western coast on the night of the 5th continued to advance. The enemy advancing south from the north has also reached the area of Zhenyubi, and its movement has slowed down slightly, but the enemy in that area seems to be preparing for the next attack.

Front Base, 7th (Central News Agency Telegram) – The war situation in Okinawa has now reached a serious stage. Since the Japanese air force units landed at the northern and central airfields on the 24th, the battle for air supremacy over Okinawa Island has been going on for two weeks. In order to regain the geographical advantage of air supremacy, the enemy seems to have adopted the following methods: Strategic Bombing by B29 Type: Continuous three times of bombing the Keihin area, the number and scale of Osaka and Kobe are unprecedented. The enemy may be trying to mobilize more than 900 B29-type aircraft from the Mariana base to turn Japan's major cities into ashes. This is because the Japanese Giretsu Airborne Corps and the Kamikaze Shinbu Special Attack Corps attacked the Okinawan air supremacy from the 24th of last month to the end of that month, which caused a setback, so they tried to use this as a restraint and cut off the succession of the special attack corps. Organization of Small Aircraft: Because the use of the northern and central bases by enemy ground aircraft is obstructed, they are trying to mainly dispatch P51, F6F, F4, U and other types of aircraft from the Ie Island base to suppress the Okinawan sky, and are striving to restore the use of the northern and central airfields. In addition, the air power of the mobile unit was dispatched to ensure the air supremacy of Okinawa, and a total of 400 aircraft were dispatched to attack the Japanese bases, with the aim of the aviation facilities of the Japanese bases, in order to completely control the activities of the Japanese special attack corps. The Movement of Enemy Mobile Units: The enemy mobile units in the vicinity of Okinawa are all based on three aircraft carriers. One group appeared east of Okinawa on the 3rd, and the mobile units in the west are also gradually moving northeast, but they are all in the area outside the range of the Japanese base air force, and are acting cautiously, and have repeatedly changed their course at night to conceal their purpose. This is different from the actions of the enemy mobile units in the previous two months, so it can be seen how they want to avoid the power of the Japanese special attack corps.

Travel Correspondence

### Impressions of Eastern Zhejiang (1)

– Yifei

On the Hangzhou-Xiaoshan Road

This reporter was dispatched to Eastern Zhejiang for investigation. The route taken was along the Hanyi Highway, passing through Xiaoshan and Shaoxing to the Cao'e River, then crossing the river to Baiguan on the opposite bank, and heading straight to Ningbo, then turning to Fenghua, with the hometown as the end point. The total journey is 324 kilometers. (Excluding the Shanghai-Hangzhou section.) Because wartime transportation is not smooth, stops were made repeatedly along the way to wait for transportation, and it took a total of half a month for the round trip.

Difficulty in Travel

The most detestable aspect of this trip is the frequent sight of checkpoints and military police arbitrarily extorting money from ordinary travelers, resulting in financial losses. These military police often forcibly take travelers' belongings when inspecting them, occupying them as their own. This is more blatant than extortion. These illegal acts of military police were previously only heard of, but witnessing the reality makes one deeply detest and abhor them. Take Hangzhou as an example: to travel from the city to Xixing (belonging to Xiaoshan County) on the opposite bank, separated only by the Qiantang River, you have to pass five checkpoints starting from Fengshanmen. The Fengshanmen and Xixing checkpoints are the most fierce, causing all kinds of difficulties for travelers, using the pretext that citizens' certificates from various places are not valid, and extorting huge amounts of bribes, the amount of which varies from several thousand to tens of thousands of yuan depending on the person. If travelers protest slightly, a large palm will immediately arrive, and they will threaten to tear up their residence permits. After a long time of entanglement, the travelers become impatient to start their journey, and finally give in. According to general estimates, the total amount of illegal extortion income per checkpoint per day is approximately between six or seven hundred thousand to one million yuan. The strangest thing is that these military police openly claim that they have to pay a huge "start-up fee" to their "superiors" every day (the police at Fengshanmen said that they have to pay 160,000 yuan every day), while the Xiaoshan County police in Xixing said that their positions were all bought with huge bribes. In order to recover their capital, they have no choice but to rely on the welfare of travelers. According to Zhejiang Province's new governor, Ding Mocun, who recently took office, and at the beginning of his office, he hopes to strictly prohibit the extra-war actions of illegal military police to facilitate travel.

Starting from Hangzhou City at 10:00 AM on May 14th, I bought a boat at the No. 1 Wharf of Sanlang Temple (under the jurisdiction of Zhejiang Province Construction) to cross the Qiantang River to the Yidu Wharf. We passed the "Long Bridge." Most of the bridge wood was destroyed, and walking on it felt quite uneasy. Especially for children, if they are not careful, there is a great danger of falling into the river. After crossing the river, I took the Huazhong bus to Xiaoshan at 12:30 PM. The two places are only 11 kilometers apart, so it only took about three quarters of an hour to reach, and the fare was 2,000 yuan.

Xiaoshan

When the bus arrived in Xiaoshan around 1:00, travelers who wanted to go to Shaoxing had to change buses. The bus stopped at the foot of Xishan Mountain in Xiaoshan. It was hot and sultry, and the bus was unbearably hot. Since there were still two hours to stay, I took the opportunity to visit the streets. The county seat of Xiaoshan has been abandoned, and there are only a few ruins that can be used for tourists to mourn. The area of the urban area is not large, and there are many mountains in the four borders. The population of the entire county is about 120,000, and most of them are farmers. Because of the lack of production, people's livelihood is extremely difficult. In the county seat, only the "Long Street" next to the Zhiguo Temple near the bus station is about two li long. There are sporadic small shops on both sides. More than half of the houses in the entire city were destroyed by artillery fire during the incident, and broken walls and ruins are everywhere. Outside the east gate, there is a huge chimney standing independently. Asking the villagers, I learned that it was the original site of the "Tonghe Gong" textile factory before the war. The factory buildings have been wiped out, and the area is desolate and full of coffins. The villagers' words are full of feelings about the past and present.

In addition to highways directly to the Qiantang River and Shaoxing, there are also trains from Hangzhou City, and there are also small steamships belonging to the Huazhong Railway (now renamed the Zhongzhina Transportation Group) to Shaoxing. Unfortunately, the former has recently been suspended, and the latter is irregular, and the public security is unstable along the way, and it is often attacked in the middle, so the number of shifts is at least limited, and merchants cannot use it, and its contribution to transportation is minimal.

### B29 Enemy Planes Attack Osaka and Kobe; Confirmed 68 Shot Down

Tokyo, 7th (Central News Agency Telegram) – The Central Military District Headquarters announced at 2:00 PM on the 7th of this month: About 250 B29 type enemy planes from the southern region invaded the surrounding area of Osaka City from the Kii Channel around 10:00 AM on the 7th and exclusively mixedly dropped incendiary bombs and bombs. From around 10:40 AM to 1:10 PM, they gradually retreated from the Kumano Nada. Fires broke out in the northern part of Osaka City, which were gradually extinguished. The results of the battle and the extent of the damage are currently under investigation.

Tokyo, 7th (Central News Agency Telegram) – About 350 B29 type enemy planes attacked Kobe on the morning of the 5th. After the Japanese army fiercely counterattacked, a detailed investigation confirmed that 68 were shot down, and 160 were damaged. Among the 68 shot down, some were shot down by ground fire, and the other 37 were shot down in air combat.

Fukuoka, 6th (Central News Agency Telegram) – About 30 enemy small aircraft, divided into five formations and led by two patrol airships, invaded the vicinity of Sata Point from Shibushi Bay from around 3:00 PM to 4:00 PM on the 6th and acted over the Osumi Peninsula and the Satsuma Peninsula. After 4:00 PM, they returned to their original route. The enemy aircraft probably took off from Okinawa Base and tried to suppress the Japanese army's special attack forces.

### The Soviet Union Expresses Dissatisfaction with Britain for Harshly Treating Soviet Wartime Criminals

### Four Countries Exercise Administrative Power, Willing to Consult with the United Nations, Soviet Side Plans to Disperse British and American Military Strength

Lisbon, 7th (Central News Agency) – Washington reports that the governments of the United States, Britain, the Soviet Union, and France issued a statement on the 5th, the original text of which is as follows: The governments of the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union, and the Provisional Government of France, having issued a statement in Berlin on May 5th, have now assumed supreme authority over the administration of Germany. The four governments hereby announce that they are willing to consult with other United Nations governments regarding the exercise of administrative power.

Three Countries Appoint Political Advisors

Lisbon, 7th (Central News Agency) – The political advisors of the British, American, and Soviet occupation forces in Germany, who previously also served as representatives of the Civil Affairs Department of the Central European Management Committee, according to a telegram from London, the British government has also appointed Sir William Strang, the former British representative to the European Advisory Commission, as advisor to the British forces. The American military advisor will be Mr. Murphy. It is feared that the Soviet Union will appoint a Deputy People's Commissar.

Lisbon, 7th (Central News Agency) – American journalist Mr. Middleton, in an article in a New York publication, stated that the first meeting of the Allied Control Council, attended by the military leaders of the four countries, each accompanied by top political and military advisors, concluded hastily after the four countries signed a joint declaration regarding the disposition of defeated Germany. It is reported that General Zhukov was only authorized to sign this joint declaration on behalf of Moscow, and therefore, during the meeting, he was unwilling to participate in discussions regarding the organization of the Control Council and its various procedures and methods, and silently waited for the representatives of the other three countries to resolve various important issues. The journalist further commented, "The Soviet authorities are now cautiously considering dispersing the military strength of the two major Western European allies (Britain and the United States). They are waiting for the American forces to withdraw from a portion of the Soviet occupation zone and for the British forces to withdraw from the western region of the Elbe River. General Zhukov's unwillingness to participate in various issues is nothing more than for this reason. However, unless the four governments jointly issue a demarcation line for the occupation zones, the British and American military strength cannot be completely dispersed."

Soviet Newspaper Publishes Map of Occupation Zone

Stockholm, 7th (Central News Agency) – A London dispatch states that a Soviet newspaper yesterday published a detailed map clearly outlining the Soviet occupation zone in Germany as detailed in the first document issued by the four occupying powers. The map both confirms the reports concerning the division of the territories and indicates that the Soviet occupation zone will start from Lübeck (British occupation zone), including Magdeburg, the entire region of Saxony-Anhalt, and the entire Saxony region. The public publication of this detailed map of the Soviet occupation zone is in fact related to the two demands that the Soviet authorities will propose: that the allocation of zonal division matters should begin immediately, and that the British and American troops should withdraw immediately from the areas designated as the Soviet occupation zone. If the United States wishes to implement the withdrawal, it will have to abandon 150 kilometers of territory in the Saxony and Saxony-Anhalt regions, including Leipzig, Zwickau, Halle, Dessau, Weimar, Jena, and Eisenach. At the same time, the United States must withdraw 60 kilometers from central Germany, including Magdeburg. The British withdrawal will require Britain to abandon a small portion of the area, including the city of Wismar on the Baltic Sea. It is generally believed that the British and American authorities both hope to resolve the division of the Austrian occupation zone at the same time. The British and American military delegations that have arrived in Vienna are currently working on resolving this matter.

The special tax section of the Municipal Finance Bureau only has types such as wood, bamboo, livestock, etc. However, recently someone suggested to the bureau to collect a special business tax for tea houses and water shops, and requested permission to try it out. It is learned that the responsible authorities of the bureau, after considering the matter, believe that if the special tax is implemented, the burden on merchants and the people will be heavy, which will further stimulate prices. Therefore, the proposers were instructed that to open a tea house, they must apply to the bureau for a business license, pay the license business tax, and collect the special consumption tax on behalf of the government. The request to open a special business tax for tea houses and water shops in this city is close to excessive and cannot be approved.

### Education Issues Mayor's Scholarship

The bureau has ordered all schools to collect and forward the scholarship. It is also heard that the bureau, with the mayor's intention to reward outstanding students and subsidize the poor, will expand the number of awards and increase the scholarship amount starting from the next academic year.

### Summer Water Consumption Reduced by 30% of Limit, Adjustments Can Be Applied for if Consumption is Insufficient

The Municipal Water Company Authority stated that since the summer season has arrived, the water demand of each user will increase accordingly. Starting today, the water consumption can be handled according to the summer limit, but in order to strengthen water conservation, the limit will be reduced by another 30%, which is calculated as 70% of the limit stated in the original notification. According to the business authorities of the company, the reduction of the summer water limit for citizens is actually to strengthen water conservation. It is hoped that all users will cooperate in saving water and ensure that the amount of water used does not exceed the limit. If there is any confusion about the limit, or if the limit is insufficient for use, you can directly negotiate with them, and it is hoped that you will provide a written statement of the number of people and the amount of water required for consideration and adjustment.

In order to understand the actual electricity demand of each factory, it has ordered the China National Industries Association to conduct a survey on the current electricity demand of factories with excellent performance and perfect equipment in this city for reference in implementing power distribution adjustment. After receiving the order, the association has now begun planning and implementing it. It is reported that the factories to be surveyed by the ministry include: knitted goods, wool fibers, wool products, silk factories, silk fabrics, commercial products, blended fabrics, Western medicine, pigments, dyes, alcohol, chemical industrial raw materials, and other products, industrial oils, coal balls, cigarettes and tobacco leaves, rubber, hardware, electrical appliances, leather, papermaking, etc. It is also learned that the association is also conducting a survey on the electricity demand of daily necessities factories in this city.

At the same time, it also urges the Rice and Grain, Flour and Wheat, Oil Grain, Cotton Industry, Daily Necessities and other control committees to quickly prepare a summary of the implementation of control business over the past year for submission to the Executive Yuan for review.

### Illegal Discounting of Negotiable Instruments Should Be Cracked Down On

There is a lack of cash in this city, and the practice of discounting crossed checks and fund transfer orders is still rampant. The source of cash for these small money houses deserves attention. The Central Reserve Authorities also clarified their determination to crack down on such illegal discounting. However, according to reporters, the discounting is still being carried out openly and secretly. Not long ago, the discount per yuan was only three or four cents, but it suddenly jumped to seven or eight cents yesterday. The competent authorities should find ways to strictly crack down on it, and the whereabouts of the vouchers received by each bank and bank should also be secretly investigated.

### Enemy Forces in Okinawa Suffer Unprecedented Damage: Military Expert Assesses World Situation

A certain military commentator in this city recently gave me the following statement regarding the recent war situation and international landscape:

Fierce battles are underway on the ground south of Okinawa Island, at the Naha airfield and port, and south of Shuri. The main Japanese forces continue to inflict significant blows on the enemy. In the seas surrounding Okinawa, Japanese special attack units brave severe weather to launch fierce attacks on the enemy fleet, causing heavy damage. As of now, enemy losses on land are approximately 80,000 personnel. If we calculate based on a loss of 75% for each ship sunk and 50% for each ship damaged, the losses at sea would be over 320,000, totaling 400,000. Considering the losses in previous battles at Leyte, Mindoro, Ie Shima, and Okinawa, the numbers increase with each encounter. According to Hanson W. Baldwin of *The New York Times*, the losses of American personnel are extremely serious, prompting a warning. Lawrence also stated that the losses suffered by the U.S. military in the Okinawa campaign are more severe than those at Pearl Harbor, hence the plan to form a commission of inquiry to investigate. This proves that American continued operations against Japan will undoubtedly lead to even greater personnel losses. The Japanese military, with its spirit of "one kills a hundred" in special attack units, will inevitably make the American personnel losses a severely critical problem. According to Lieutenant General Millard Harmon, the U.S. commander of mobile forces on Okinawa Island, speaking to reporters in Washington on the 3rd, the Japanese special attack units use a dive-bombing tactic. With the sacrifice of only one person, the accuracy is superior to ordinary attacks. Therefore, the U.S. military should utilize all possible measures to deal with this threat. At the same time, Hanson Baldwin also stated that the U.S. losses in this operation are greater at sea than on land, which proves the success of the Japanese special attack units. Therefore, victory in the future war will undoubtedly belong to Japan. Furthermore, in Kangas in Luzon Island, Santa Fe, Mindoro, Tarakan, and Buin in Bougainville Island, Japanese morale is high, and fierce battles continue.

Handling the German Issue

According to a broadcast from San Francisco on June 7, the Allied Supreme Command Committee, consisting of representatives from the United States, Britain, the Soviet Union, and France, reached an agreement in Berlin regarding the terms of Germany's unconditional surrender, which has been announced in London, Moscow, Washington, and Paris. The territory of Germany is divided into four zones as defined on December 31, 1937: the northwest to Britain, the southwest to the United States, the east to the Soviet Union, and a portion of the west to France. It is questionable what contribution this measure will make to the postwar peace advocated by these powers. Considering the events of the twenty years after the First World War and the recent so-called new world organization, it seems extremely vague. The various countries plan to separate Austria and Czechoslovakia from Germany, which will inevitably form a painful existence for the Germanic people, whether in Europe or the world.

Near East Problem

The conflicts among the countries of Lebanon have come to an end militarily, but they are not yet resolved politically. According to a broadcast from San Francisco on June 6, General Spears requested that the Soviet Union and China participate in discussions, namely a meeting of the five major powers, but Churchill rejected this, believing that it would take a long time. Churchill also stated in the House of Commons that the United States, Britain, and France should immediately come forward to mediate this conflict. Based on the various disputes caused by the First World War and the recent social problems in the Islamic world, the situation is extremely complex.

San Francisco Conference

On June 6, London's *The Times* published a commentary on the San Francisco Conference from San Francisco, stating that the opinions of the United States, Britain, the Soviet Union, France, and China are extremely divided regarding the veto power. Stanley Babson, a special correspondent for Reuters in San Francisco, stated that Truman and Churchill have requested Stalin to reach a compromise. If the opinions of the various countries differ on this issue, and if the disputes over mandated territories are added, the outcome of the San Francisco Conference will inevitably become a soap bubble. Before the closing of the conference, it is filled with all kinds of disputes, which shows that this conference has become a grand opening but a poor closing, and will inevitably end inconclusively. The repeated delays in the return of Harry Hopkins, the American envoy to Moscow, to Washington are undoubtedly greatly related to this.

Kuomintang-Communist Friction

According to a Reuters dispatch from Chongqing on the 6th, Chen Cheng, Minister of War of the Chongqing government, admitted that there have been various frictions between the Chongqing government and the Communist Party in recent months. He also stated that the munitions loaned by the United States have never been used in the war against the Communists. Song Ziwen's visit to Moscow will undoubtedly create more difficulties on this issue. Chen stated that the responsibility for the Kuomintang-Communist friction should be borne by the Communist Party. This issue has been silent for a long time, and now its exposure is nothing more than a promotional stunt. After the Sixth Plenary Session of the Central Committee, the number of standing committee members of the First Executive Committee was increased, with Wu Tiecheng replacing Kong Xiangxi. This represents a gesture of flattery towards the reform faction of nationalism.
