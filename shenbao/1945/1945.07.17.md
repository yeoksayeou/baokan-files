### His Majesty the Emperor Commends Soldiers Fighting Bravely in Borneo, Expresses Gratitude to Troops There

Tokyo, 16th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese forces at Balikpapan and Tarakan Island in Borneo, fighting bravely with few soldiers, inflicted heavy blows on the enemy. Particularly in the Balikpapan area, since the 8th, they have killed or wounded 400 enemy soldiers. Furthermore, the Japanese troops on Tarakan Island cleared out the remaining enemy on the 13th, achieving significant merit. During Chief of Staff of the Army General Staff, General Umezuâ€™s, report to Chief of the Army General Command, General Takeda, on the 14th regarding the war situation, His Majesty the Emperor commended the courageous battles of the Japanese generals and soldiers in both locations and conveyed a special expression of gratitude to the troops there.

Southern Frontline Base, 16th (Central News Agency) - The fighting in the Balikpapan area has now shifted to the Bingling Mountains. The Japanese army's unique charging tactics destroyed enemy tanks one by one, causing the enemy great distress. Relying on the power of mortars and aerial bombing, they attempted to destroy Japanese positions. On the 11th, with four tanks and three companies of troops, they attacked the Japanese army's deep defenses on the Marinda Highway but were driven back by the Japanese army's fierce attack. The enemy suffered 150 casualties. Enemy aircraft changed the direction of bombing, attempting to burn down Nining, behind the Japanese army's positions, and landed a small number of troops. However, considering the overall war situation in that area, it is no longer of much value. The Japanese air service unit on the ground repeatedly attacked enemy forces in the airfield area, destroying three enemy barracks and two material accumulation points, as well as damaging 20 engines. In response, Japanese special attack planes, on the night of the 10th, strongly attacked enemy ships in the harbor, sinking a destroyer.

### Fleet Attacking Hokkaido Temporarily Retreats to the Sea, Many Enemy Carrier-Based Aircraft Shot Down

Tokyo, 16th (Central News Agency) - Four days after the enemy mobile unit attacked the Kanto region on the 10th, on the 14th and 15th, carrier-based aircraft and naval guns attacked the Tohoku region and southern Hokkaido region of Japan. On the 16th, due to poor weather and other factors, they appeared to temporarily retreat to the sea. However, when they attacked the Kanto region on the 10th and the Tohoku and Hokkaido regions on the 14th and 15th, a considerable number of enemy carrier-based aircraft were shot down. However, considering the overall situation, it is thought that they have not suffered significant losses, and close vigilance is still required regarding their future movements. Furthermore, the enemy carrier-based aircraft that attacked the Tohoku region and southern Hokkaido region totaled approximately 1,000 on the 14th and reached 1,050 on the 15th. Japanese damage was extremely minor.

Tokyo, 16th (Central News Agency) - The enemy mobile unit that appeared on the eastern sea of Kanto on the 10th has now moved north, and on the 14th, morning attacks by carrier-based aircraft targeted the Tohoku region and southern Hokkaido region. According to an announcement by Nimitz Headquarters on the 12th, the main force of the mobile unit consisted of more than ten vessels, including four standard aircraft carriers, four battleships, and five cruisers, all of which are the latest American fleet, accompanied by oil tankers. In addition, there should be several converted auxiliary aircraft carriers, which are responsible for the direct cover of the fleet after the carrier-based aircraft of the standard carriers depart. On the 10th, more than 1,200 carrier-based aircraft attacked Kanto from morning to evening.

Aomori, 16th (Central News Agency) - On the morning of the 14th, enemy aircraft dispatched a total of about 200 carrier-based aircraft in succession, and in the afternoon, a total of 5-600 large and small aircraft attacked the entire area of Aomori Prefecture.

Lisbon, 16th (Central News Agency) - According to a telegram from the Azores, Nimitz Headquarters announced on the 15th the shelling of Muroran as follows: The US shelling force, composed of several battleships from the Pacific Fleet, began shelling the shores of Muroran in southern Hokkaido at around 9:35 AM (Tokyo time) on the 15th and is still continuing under the command of Rear Admiral Barbey. It is also reported that the battleships "Iowa," "Missouri," "Wisconsin," and two destroyers participated in the operation during the shelling.

Air Raids on Japanese Mainland and Korean Border

Tokyo, 16th (Central News Agency) - Eight enemy B-29 aircraft, at around 0:30 AM on the 16th, invaded the mainland from the Fukushima region, passed through the Yamagata and Niigata regions, dropped naval mines in the Sea of Japan, and then escaped south from Fukushima. A part of the enemy aircraft escaped south through Nagano, Kai, and Suruga.

Nagoya, 16th (Central News Agency) - At around 0:30 PM on the 15th, approximately 100 enemy P-51 aircraft, led by a small number of large aircraft, attacked the Tokai region, mainly targeting airfields.

### Chongqing National Assembly Will Begin Summoning

Guangzhou, 16th (Central News Agency) - Conflicting opinions have arisen at the Chongqing National Political Council regarding the implementation of party and government affairs. Therefore, Chiang Kai-shek had to postpone the National Assembly scheduled to be convened in November. Regarding this matter, the Chongqing United Press reported as follows: "The Yan'an and Democratic League factions oppose the Chongqing-proposed National Assembly, given that the assembly is completely controlled by the Kuomintang. Therefore, Chiang Kai-shek may intend to postpone the convening of the assembly. At the same time, Chiang Kai-shek stated at the Political Council that it is regrettable that those who oppose the implementation of constitutional government after the war are attacking the government's policies. However, the government will decide on various issues concerning the convocation of the National Assembly after listening to the views of everyone. From this, it can be seen that Chiang Kai-shek intends to postpone the National Assembly session."

### Suzhou-Changshu Highway Prepares for Repair

Suzhou, 16th (Central News Agency) - The repair work on the road surface and bridges of the Suzhou-Changshu Highway has long been completed by the Wu and Chang counties in conjunction with the Engineering Office of the Provincial Construction Department. Currently, due to several heavy rains washing away the roadbed, it has been damaged again. Therefore, Wu and Chang are now preparing to recruit workers for further repairs.

Editorial

### What Responsibility Have the Economic Actors Fulfilled?

The editorial in the Dalu Xinbao two days ago, titled "The Responsibility of Chinese Economic Actors," concluded: "We especially hope that Chinese economic actors do not forget the fate of the nation for the sake of private gain." This statement is very painful.

The so-called economic actors refer to people in the financial and industrial sectors. Standing in the position of the people, we can ask them: In recent years, have they contributed more to the country and society, or have they done more harm? Or they can ask themselves: How much effort have they made for the country and society?

For example, the recent rural loans in the rice-producing areas of Jiangsu Province are the electricity-time opportunity for the Shanghai economic sector to fulfill its responsibilities. The purpose of rural loans is to increase production and reduce the suffering of farmers. But how many people in the Shanghai economic sector can recognize its importance? Also, Shanghai's factories are stagnating in production due to insufficient electricity and other raw materials. We therefore have a suggestion for the dispersal of small factories, but how many economic actors can make up their minds to move the factories to the interior, create a new environment, and open up new industrial outlets?

What we hear are only unfounded rumors in the market, what we see are only speculations in gold bars and stocks, or hoarding and opportunistic transactions. The places where national laws and regulations are insufficient, and the places where economic policies are inadequate, have become good opportunities for them to exploit and profit. Whether it is the allocation slip or the promissory note, if we only think about the good aspects, it is originally a temporary transitional measure. However, the authorities have not thoroughly investigated the many malpractices and the extensive harm, but the economic actors in Shanghai believe that they can do whatever they want. Therefore, they issue allocation slips in excess and manipulate the spot exchange rate, creating a chaotic phenomenon in the financial sector and causing a great threat to the lives of the general public. These economic actors can be said to be only afraid that the national economy will not collapse. They completely forget the national concept and the social concept, and only seek to satisfy their private interests and desires.

Even among the leading figures in the economic sector, there are inevitably shameless people mixed in. On the surface, they say that their political views are different, but in reality, they try their best to pursue exorbitant profits in the peace zone. This situation proves that the political views they say are just a mask. Can a person who truly loves the country and the people do such a thing? If these people do not thoroughly realize this, not only will the "self-defense and self-governance" system not be established, but it will also lead to serious consequences for the country and society!

Taking a step back, we at least hope that they can do something for the place where they live, eat, and trade, and take out a bit of their conscience to serve the local community. Otherwise, their self-interested profiteering behavior is really enough to promote the chronic collapse of the social economy.

If we only wait for the economic actors to reflect on their own initiative, I am afraid it will be extremely difficult. Therefore, we advocate strengthening political power. Only strong politics can curb the bad phenomena in the economic sector. The report on the thirty-five bank guilds that was published a few days ago is only the tip of the iceberg of the corruption in the financial sector. The elimination of the bad elements in the entire financial and industrial sectors still depends on strong politics. We are eagerly looking forward to it.

Translation and Commentary: The Responsibility of Chinese Economic Actors

What is expected of the Chinese people in order to prepare for the occurrence of extraordinary events is the establishment of a system of self-defense, self-governance, and self-reliance, and the prevention of public suffering arising from the development of the war situation to the minimum extent. We have repeatedly firmly advocated this, and we firmly believe that this basic belief is shared by both Japanese officials and civilians.

The reason why so much is expected of the Chinese people in order to prepare for extraordinary events is that traditional Chinese morality is still strong and powerful, and the concepts of popular autonomy and homeland defense are still deeply rooted. If the Chinese people truly rise up with the determination to protect their own hometowns, no matter what happens in the future, the Chinese territory and people can be safe and sound. Conversely, if the enthusiasm for self-defense and self-governance is lost, the national tragedy is unavoidable.

The reason why we reiterate this proposal here is that in the recent activities of Chinese economic actors, there are indeed situations that make us feel contrary to our expectations. By observing the recent dishonest behavior of financial institutions, the rumors spread in the market, and the active speculators, we can know that it can be said that these bad economic actors are the ones who will cause extraordinary events in Shanghai in the future. If these people do not fundamentally reflect on this, the construction of a system of popular self-defense, self-governance, and self-reliance is hopeless.

Let's take a few specific questions as examples. For example, the allocation slips issued by Chinese commercial banks may not be reprehensible in essence. However, the banks misused the allocation slips and issued them improperly, causing credit to expand, the financial foundation to be in a dangerous situation, and giving the price side a bad influence. The allocation slip is just a temporary countermeasure for the banks, but once it is put into use, it runs counter to the mission of the allocation slip due to private interests and desires. Because of this situation, although the allocation slip was abolished, the promissory note took the stage, but there is no change now.

Furthermore, speaking of the coming problem, since the implementation of emergency measures for rice, the price of rice in Shanghai has shown a slight downward trend, while the price of rice in various places has gradually risen, causing the local people to suffer. Speculators in Shanghai and other places want to compete to buy rice in various places, and the result is such a real situation. It is still fortunate that the lack of cash and the difficulty of exchange have hindered the activities of rice merchants, and the price of rice in various places has barely gradually prevented the rise. In the future, if funds can be allowed to flow into various places by any means, the rice speculation business will inevitably be very rampant. This is also the result of the plotting of dishonest economic actors who ignore the suffering of the people and enrich their own pockets.

In the Shanghai market and other places, there are unfounded rumors every day that make people panic. Due to these rumors, speculators act recklessly, and then the price of gold bars and commodities jumps accordingly. Many speculators have accumulated hundreds of millions of fortunes, and the lives of the people are gradually declining. This is the true state of the Shanghai economic sector. In this way, how is the establishment of a self-defense and self-governance system possible!

We deeply believe that China's territory and people must be defended and prepared for by the Chinese, but a part of the Chinese economic actors are disregarding the sacrifices of their territory and people and are obsessed with private interests and desires. In this way, can China's emergency system be built! We raise the responsibility of Chinese economic actors again because of the above facts. The responsibility of economic actors is very important now that the situation is so pressing. We especially hope that economic actors do not forget the fate of the nation for the sake of private gain. (Translated from the Dalu Xinbao, July 15)

### Cleaning Up Corruption and Extortion: Governor Ding's First Order

â€” Our Reporter Tang Yi

The so-called "Anti-Communist Alliance Zhejiang Branch," falsely claiming a name, defrauded good citizens on trumped-up charges. They even privately established branches in various counties and extorted tolls along the way. Governor Ding heard the report and was furious, ordering them to cease their activities. This was listed as the most important first news item in the Zhejiang Daily on July 14th.

To understand how dark the Zhejiang provincial government was in the past, just look at the following two incidents, which can give a general idea: On the short journey from Hangzhou to Fuyang, there were more than 40 officially established checkpoints collecting donations, and countless deserters from the police force running "temporary donation collection" businesses; from Wuxing City to the Chen Yingshi Tomb scenic spot outside the South Gate, within a few miles, there were 18 checkpoints, and the number of plainclothes officials impersonating military police was impossible to count. Not only was it difficult for good merchants and civilians to go out, but they often faced the danger of "sitting at home and misfortune falling from the sky."

Look also at how the police at the Hangzhou train station city gate extorted travelers. According to an investigation by the Zhejiang Provincial Police Department (from June 1st to 4th), there were the following eight types:

Long-Standing Abuses by the Hangzhou Police

When selling train tickets at the station, there is a fixed quota, and the "farming teams" must buy tickets. The police take the opportunity to extort money, with each traveler having to pay 300 to 500 yuan.

When individuals traveling alone carry controlled goods, or carry a larger quantity of uncontrolled goods, the police extort money, usually ranging from one or two thousand to ten or twenty thousand yuan each time, with particularly large sums of dirty money involved.

Those carrying a large amount of cash, or carrying enemy currency, are the best targets for extortion, mostly depending on the amount carried. However, some transporters automatically make prior arrangements, paying bribes to pass through.

Travelers with a large number of luggage items are regular customers of the police.

When peasants carry vegetables and rice into the city, they are either asked for cash at the checkpoints or part of their goods are confiscated.

Villagers who exchange the proceeds from selling rice, firewood, and vegetables for daily necessities have to leave behind "toll money" when passing through the city gates.

To avoid difficulties when cars pass through the city gates, they have to pay once every three to five days, ranging from three to five thousand to ten or twenty thousand yuan each time. As for cars smuggling goods, they are extorted tens of thousands of yuan each time.

The police at the Liangshanmen train station, thinking that "the heavens are high and the emperor is far away," extort at least 500 yuan from each passenger, whether they are entering or leaving the station, carrying items or empty-handed.

Therefore, the police at the train station and city gates have lucrative positions, and each person trying to obtain them pays bribes starting from at least 150,000 yuan.

The above points are only from the results of official investigations. At the same time, this is just the police; in addition, there are all kinds of groups and soldiers, as well as plainclothes individuals who do not wear uniforms. The defenseless people are truly said to be in deep water and scorching fire.

Cutting Through the Gordian Knot

In such a bad environment, we can imagine the troubles of Ding Mou, who appeared as the responsible person in charge.

Like lightning, within a month, a large number of county magistrates were dismissed and transferred. Ding, in the name of the provincial military and political commander, issued extremely strict orders prohibiting corruption and extortion, abolished the blockade management bureau, abolished the inspection stations, and unscrupulous officials, soldiers, and police were accused and punished in silence. Just like the many vertical lines engraved on Ding's triangular face, and the paleness of his complexion, he is stern and unforgiving.

For major policies, the reporter still focused on the police, who have the closest relationship with the common people.

A patrolling officer and policemen at the Changshanmen train station were arbitrarily extorting travelers. Lu Yiran, who also served as the police chief, personally went to arrest them, confiscating 690,000 yuan of dirty money from the policemen. It was also verified that the patrolling officer collected 300,000 yuan from the policemen in the name of sending holiday gifts to the station chief during the Dragon Boat Festival. The patrolling officer and all the policemen below him were all dismissed.

Zhu Qingxiang, the police chief of the second station in the city, Wang Jinquan, the police chief of the fifth station, and a certain Sun, a policeman of the eighth station, extorted 20,000 yuan from a traveler from Jiaxing to Hangzhou (because they were carrying 1.2 million yuan in cash). All three were dismissed and would never be employed again.

Wang Chunjiang, a policeman from the second provincial police brigade, was selling black market train tickets at the station. After verification, he was sent to court for punishment.

Han Baokun, the police chief of Shanmen, hired a child named Yu Hongsheng as an accomplice, secretly collecting illegal fees at the city gate. After it was reported, the police chief personally investigated and confiscated the dirty money on the spot. The police chief was immediately dismissed.

The police guarding Qingchunmen and Shanmen made things difficult for rice vendors entering the city. The two police sub-bureau chiefs in charge were warned.

Future Expectations

Lu Yiran, who is also the police chief of Hangzhou, said that the rectification results only reached one-third of the expected target. If it is not affected by political, economic, or "other" forces, it is not difficult to achieve further progress.

Governor Ding Mou told reporters: "I have only been in office for over a month, so it is naturally difficult to completely eliminate corruption and extortion. However, if given time, the suffering of the people will gradually be reduced. To eliminate the current bad phenomena, we must fundamentally start by improving the salaries of civil servants, soldiers, and police. On the principle of not increasing the burden on the people, the provincial government is reorganizing tax revenues, eliminating embezzlement, and has achieved considerable results. Central government employees have grain allowances, but we don't. Although the salaries of Zhejiang provincial government employees have been relatively high in the past two months, they are actually still not keeping up. Now we are preparing to make up for it to the same level of treatment. The main source of revenue for the finance is the land tax. It will certainly be difficult to achieve this goal in August and September, when the collection of actual goods has not yet begun." Governor Ding said here, a shadow covering his face, and after a moment of silence, he said in a resolute tone: "However, Iâ€”am determined to do so."

### U.S. Under Secretary of the Army Admits to Japanese Tactical Skill; Cave Warfare Especially Effective

Lisbon, 16th (Central News Agency telegram) - A dispatch from New York reports that U.S. Under Secretary of the Army Patterson, on the 15th, elaborated on the tactics of the Japanese army as follows: The Japanese army's combat situation, which has recently achieved great effectiveness, is cave warfare. This tactic will be even more effective if implemented on Japanese soil. Furthermore, the Japanese army has recently increased the implementation of skillful tactics. Taking the Okinawa operation as an example, when facing enemy naval gun fire, the Japanese army adopted the tactic of attacking the landing enemy troops at sea, while simultaneously defending and securing positions. The effectiveness of Japanese firearms is even better than last year. On the other hand, the Japanese air force, which previously dove into American ships diagonally from the sea to launch torpedoes, now dives straight down toward the target ships from high clouds. The Japanese army is also appearing on the battlefield with new types of amphibious tanks, light tanks, and reconnaissance vehicles, whose functions are very good. These vehicles have demonstrated their various advantages in past operations in Manchuria and China.

### Song-Stalin Talks Related to East Asia

Tokyo, 16th (Central News Agency telegram) - Song Ziwen has held several talks with Chairman Stalin in Moscow over the past two weeks, working to improve the relationship between Chongqing and the Soviet Union. According to a joint statement issued by Chongqing and the Soviet Union on the 14th, Chairman Stalin had to attend the Three-Power Conference urgently, so the talks were temporarily suspended, and Song Ziwen has also returned to Chongqing. This announcement indicates that it is related to the Soviet Union's East Asia policy, and the relationship between Chongqing and the Soviet Union is now at a time for a comprehensive review. After five talks with Song Ziwen, Chairman Stalin has likely understood the attitude of Chongqing, so he will determine his final policy toward Chongqing after clarifying the intentions of the United States at the Three-Power Conference.

Stockholm, 16th (Central News Agency telegram) - According to a dispatch from Moscow: Song Ziwen, the head of the Chongqing Executive Yuan and Army, returned to Chongqing on Saturday. It is said that he will return to Moscow in two weeks.

### Traffic Restored on Both Sides of the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway Line

Hangzhou, 16th (Central News Agency telegram) - In the past, in order to prevent unscrupulous people from sabotaging wartime transportation, the authorities specially set up obstacles on both sides of the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway line and erected wooden signs prohibiting nearby residents from entering at will.

### British Garrison in Greece Will Not Withdraw For Now

Lisbon, 16th (Central News Agency telegram) - According to a report from Athens: Recently, due to the British sphere of influence on the Greek-Turkish border and the Soviet sphere of influence on the Albanian, Yugoslav, and Bulgarian borders, the situation in the Aegean Sea has suddenly become uneasy. It is widely believed that the British garrison in Greece will remain until the spring of next year, or perhaps even longer. However, it is speculated that the fundamental plan of the British authorities is to at least have the garrison hold through the winter, and then, after the winter, have three divisions of fully equipped and well-trained Greek troops take over the defense of the area. If the situation in the Balkans becomes even more unstable, the British will not only reduce the number of their defensive forces, but will increase it. The British government deeply understands that Greece is an important key to controlling the eastern Mediterranean and the Suez Canal region.

### Draft of Trial Procedures for War Criminals Finalized

Stockholm, 16th (Central News Agency telegram) - According to a dispatch from London: According to the draft trial procedures finalized last week, all war criminals must have witnesses present at the same time when they are summoned to the international court for trial. The draft was jointly drafted by Judge Yorkson, the U.S. representative, and the representatives of the British, Soviet, and French legal systems. However, this is based on the comprehensive product of the legal codes of Britain and the United States, which are not stipulated in the Soviet Union and France. Under these legal procedures, any defendant is presumed innocent before being interrogated, until witnesses prove him guilty. This draft has now been accepted by the Soviet Union and France.

### Wavell Admits Conference Failure, Considers Second Steps

Lisbon, 16th (Central News Agency telegram) - A dispatch from Simla: Viceroy Wavell, at the Simla Conference reconvened on the 14th, stated as follows: The Simla Conference has ultimately failed. I proposed to the various parties participating in the conference a list of representatives who would participate in the Executive Council in the future. With the exception of the Muslim League, all other parties have submitted lists. I temporarily selected representatives of the various parties. I thought that the various parties in India might accept this view. Unexpectedly, when explaining the solution to Jinnah, Jinnah declared that the Muslim League could not accept this method of electing representatives. Since Jinnah had this determination, I knew that continuing the conference would be meaningless. I am now considering a second step. No matter what measures are taken in the future, my tasks, including the administration of the war against Japan and the preparation for post-war development, will still be promoted by the Indian government.

The Ninth Shanghai Special Municipal City Delegates Congress of the Chinese Kuomintang was held yesterday (the 16th) at the Huzhou Guild Hall on Guangzhou Road. Attendees included Luo Junqiang, the Central Government-appointed Election Supervisor; Hu Zewu, Deputy Secretary-General of the Municipal Government; Dai Yingfu and Qian Jianwu, members of the Central Committee; Liu Yangshan, Xu Chao Yuan, Zhou Yuying, and Gu Senchen, ex officio delegates; and elected delegates from each district: Wang Yilu and Zuo Peiyuan from the First District; Wang Wujun from the Second District; Xia Ren from the Third District; Gong Yifei and Qian Peishen from the Fourth District; Lu and Yu Zhenhui from the Fifth District; Zhang Sheng and Lu Zongxun from the Sixth District; Zhang Zhonggang and Shen Shijing from the Seventh District; Ding Zhensheng and Cao from the Eighth District; Liu Yi and Sheng from the Ninth District; Xie Ziyu from Fengxian District; Zhang Jie from Nanhui District; Chen Geng from Shenjiang District; Shen Langshan from Yongsha District; Huang Yinchang from Chongming District; Zhang Wenyuan from Jiading District; Jin Jian from Baoshan District; and Xu Yinxiang from the Wusong Direct Branch. Guests numbered several dozen. The presidium consisted of Liu Yangshan, Xu Chao Yuan, Yu Zhenhui, Liu Yi, and Shen Langshan.

Conference Proceedings

The opening ceremony was held at 9:00 a.m. The ceremony proceeded as usual. First, Liu Yangshan, a representative of the presidium, delivered the opening speech. Next, Luo Junqiang, the Central Election Supervisor, gave a speech. Committee member Xu Chao Yuan reported on party affairs, and Municipal Government Secretary-General Hu reported on municipal affairs. At noon, the Municipal Party Headquarters hosted a banquet for all the delegates. At 3:30 p.m., the discussion continued, and more than ten important cases, including the increase in the expenses of the urban district party headquarters, were passed. At 4:00 p.m., the election of the next term's Executive and Supervisory Committee members and delegates to the Chinese Kuomintang National Congress was held, and it concluded successfully at around 6:00 p.m.

Chairman's Address

Liu Yangshan, a representative of the presidium, said in his opening speech, "Today is the date for the election of the Executive and Supervisory Committee members of the Ninth Shanghai City Delegates Congress of our party. We are very pleased that the Central Government has sent Committee member Luo Junqiang to supervise the election and Committee member Dai Yingfu to provide guidance. Our party's election system has been interrupted for more than ten years and is now being restored. The election of our party is based on the principle of democracy. If the party and national election systems do not work, then true talent will not be discovered, and progress cannot be made in military and political affairs. The revolutionary spirit of our party will not be developed. Moreover, members join our party because they have political desires. If they have the opportunity to achieve their desires, they will naturally be excited. Otherwise, outstanding members will become demoralized, and those with ulterior motives will take the opportunity to become active. Now, if we want to revitalize party affairs, we must restore the election system. When the election system was interrupted, our party only had a shell left, with no spirit, only the name of the party, without showing the power of the party, and there was no way to exert the functions of the party. Therefore, the holding of this Delegates Congress and the restoration of the election system has a profound meaning. It is not just a matter of proposing proposals, but also of practically leading the masses to serve the country in the future."

Supervisor's Address

Central Committee member Luo, the Election Supervisor, said in his instructional speech, "Today is the first time we have restored the election system, and I am very honored to be here to supervise the election on behalf of the Central Government. For many years, there has been nowhere to see that the Kuomintang has a special spirit. It exists in name only. We cannot but acknowledge this fact. At present, the Communist Party is rampant. If our party does not promote the spirit of revolution, it will never be victorious. Today is the day when the election system is restored, and it is also the time when our party's spiritual work begins. Our party has more than fifty years of history. In the future, we must continuously strive for the party and the country, upholding the legacy of the martyrs. This depends on the efforts of all comrades."

Central Committee Member Dai's Words

Central Committee member Dai Yingfu said, "I believe that the work of the party does not emphasize form but emphasizes spirit. As long as we adhere to the ideology and promote the spirit, there will be infinite work to be done. Otherwise, it is dangerous to simply say that there is no work to be done. Work must be created. Looking back, the first Delegates Congress of Shanghai was held under the power of the warlords, and the environment was very difficult. However, we were able to fight unremittingly and still show the effectiveness of the party. Therefore, in the future, we must seize the opportunity, search for materials, and create welfare for the local area and the country."

Reader's Scholarship News

### Urging Philanthropists to Advocate and Fulfill the Responsibility of "Reserving Talent for the Nation"

Our newspaper's ninth session of the scholarship fund's "special fundraising" aims for 300 million yuan, scheduled to be raised within one month. Can this wish ultimately be realized by the deadline? There is no absolute certainty. However, based on past experience, we are determined not to be disappointed. Why do we have this confidence? Because Shanghai is the economic center, and there are wealthy and enthusiastic people in the economic and industrial circles everywhere. This 300 million yuan scholarship fund, shared and pledged by so many philanthropists in Shanghai, should certainly be achievable with optimism.

According to the regulations of the "special fundraising," it is divided into an honorary team of 1 million yuan and an ordinary team of 100,000 yuan. We do not harbor extravagant hopes, but only seek to adopt a cooperative approach to pledging to teams. For example, several groups or individuals jointly pledge to an honorary team or an ordinary team. In the end, "many hands make light work," and it will not feel strenuous. Our newspaper has various printed materials such as fundraising brochures, team pledge forms, and sub-pledge forms available at any time. If you are willing to help as you please, please send a letter or telegram, and we will send personnel to discuss and handle it according to your instructions.

The Yu Lin Society Teams Up to Support Scholarships

Mr. Qian Gongxia of the Yu Lin Society wrote: "After reading your newspaper's article 'Anxious about Scholarship Funds,' I was deeply moved. Since the Yu Lin Society changed its operations, it decided to donate 30% of its profits to scholarships. Because it had not yet accrued enough, it had not yet started. Today, I see the article and know that scholarship matters are urgent and brooks no delay, and it is urgently necessary to rise up together and devote all our efforts. Therefore, I specially submit a check from Wen Hui Book and Newspaper Agency's prepayment for Yu Lin pamphlets as a small response from the Yu Lin Society. Our society was founded by several colleagues in the education sector, and its purpose is to engage in social education work through publishing. Unfortunately, our ambition exceeds our ability, and we have not yet achieved anything. This time, promoting scholarships is nothing more than doing our best. I hope that all sectors will enthusiastically donate to rescue students who have dropped out of school. This is the good fortune of the poor children and the good fortune of the country's future."

Birthday Banquet to Support Scholarships

Mr. Sheng Fuhai wrote: "The sixteenth day of June this year is my father's birthday. In order to please my parents, I originally intended to hold a banquet. However, my father believes that in this time of national crisis, it is not appropriate to be extravagant. He instructed me to save the expenses of the banquet and use them for awards. Now, I respectfully follow his strict orders and send the 100,000 yuan banquet fee to your newspaper, hoping you will check and receive it."

Notice to All Levels of Schools: There are still a few student application forms for this session that have not been claimed. Please inform them to come and claim them within days with their student identification card. Also, please send personnel with a letter of certification to the office to collect the new student application forms. We are afraid of loss if sent by mail, so we will not process it.

### Six Government Employees Accused of Malfeasance Transferred to Special Court for Trial Under Anti-Corruption Laws

Yesterday, six criminals involved in three cases of corruption, intimidation, and fraud, namely Shao Tianxing, Wu Lianqing, Huang Mingqun, Yang Xiyou, Zhang Ruiyin, and Bo Yue, were found to be true by the Third Division's Investigation and Interrogation Section. With the approval of Acting Chairman Chen of the National Government via the Municipal Government, they were ordered to be handed over to the Shanghai Branch of the Special Court for trial. The bureau has handed over the aforementioned criminals and case files to the Shanghai Branch of the Special Court for trial. The details of the case are as follows:

Police Rice Fraud

Shao Tianxing, an employee of the Police Welfare Society of the Police Bureau, gave the rice tickets that had been claimed but not stamped to his friend Wu Lianqing for delivery. He entrusted Jiang Liandi to claim it twice in order to benefit himself, which was very bold and reckless. After the Investigation and Interrogation Section summoned Jiang Liandi, Jiang Lingdi, and others for questioning and after detailed investigation, it was found to be true that Shao Tianxing dared to deliberately use his position to collude with Wu Lianqing to commit fraud and seek personal gain in the distribution of police rice, violating Article 2 of the Law on Punishing Corruption of Government Employees.

Withholding Police Rice

Huang Mingqun, the chief of the 10446th Police Station of the Dongchang Road Branch, colluded with Huang Guiquan, the director of the first section of the branch who had already fled, to withhold the free rice rations of the police officers by taking advantage of their positions. The police department ordered the investigation and interrogation section to investigate after someone reported it by anonymous letter. In addition to trying to arrest the escaped Huang Guiling and others, Huang was found to have violated Article 2 and Article 7, Paragraph 2 of the Law on Punishing Corruption of Government Employees.

Intimidation and Fraud

Yang Xiyou, No. 516 of the Lujiiawan Branch, Zhang Ruiyin, No. 4961, and Bo Yue, No. 5175, broke into Li Quanfu's house at No. 2, Lane 502, Changxing Road, at about 12:00 pm on May 12 of this month. They intimidated Li by claiming to interfere with gambling and light bulb leaks in the room and demanded that he be taken to the police station for investigation. They defrauded Li of cash and remittance orders totaling 80,000 yuan. After the investigation and interrogation section found it to be true, the criminals were found to have violated Article 5 of the Law on Punishing Corruption of Government Employees.

In the future, each bank must strictly follow the requirement to issue transfer application forms for mutual payments between fellow traders, and it must be based on the next-day funds, and no concessions should be made.

Anyone who wants to place any bicycle parking rack on the sidewalk must first apply for a license from the Bureau. The application form for the license can be obtained free of charge from the Review Section of the Sixth Division of the Bureau.

The applicant must present a drawing, detailing the dimensions, structure, materials, and style of the parking rack, as well as the location of placement, and must indicate the distance between the parking rack and trees, lampposts, fire hydrants, or public parking areas.

The parking rack is limited to being placed in front of the applicant's house, and the width occupied from the side starting from the front must not exceed two feet on the sidewalk, and must not extend beyond the curb line and occupy the roadway, or occupy the area in front of other people's houses.

The parking rack must not be placed on sidewalks less than eight feet wide, and must be at least two feet away from fire hydrants or faucet joints.

The applicant is fully responsible for the parking rack and must maintain its complete condition at all times. At any time, if the Bureau believes that the placed parking rack violates the regulations or is unsatisfactory in any way, such as obstructing or endangering pedestrians and traffic, the applicant must properly improve it in accordance with the regulations within the specified period after receiving notice from the Bureau. Otherwise, the Bureau may remove all or any unsatisfactory total price of the parking rack, and all fees paid will be confiscated.

The Bureau may collect parking fees for the parking rack occupying the sidewalk and use it to improve the roads. If the parking fee is not paid on time, the Bureau may remove the parking rack.

### Tuition Fees and Teachers' Living Problems in Private Schools: Yun Shao

As this semester restarts, municipal schools are proceeding with preparations for the next semester on time in accordance with the regulations of the authorities. However, most private schools are still wandering in different directions and unable to agree on the path because tuition fees cannot be based on rice prices. Although recruitment advertisements have been published repeatedly in newspapers, the tuition fees, which are a prerequisite issue, have been omitted. This phenomenon is truly a miracle. Therefore, parents are unable to determine whether their children should go to school or not. As a result, schools recruit new students, but new students do not come; old students do not arrive for sorting. Inevitably, everything is stagnated. Among them, the most distressed are teachers. The inability of schools to determine tuition fees and the inability to predict the number of students have had a major impact on the issue of hiring. Often, schools, since there is no certainty about the number of students in the next semester, will temporarily dismiss all teachers regarding the issue of hiring, and then rehire them when there is a solution. I know that there are not a few who are actually doing this. So-called retaining teachers with proven experience, can teachers really be secure in their positions?

From the perspective of school authorities, if tuition fees are high, the number of students will inevitably decrease; if tuition fees are low, teachers' lives may not be taken care of. This is like saving the sparrow but starving the hawk; who can have it both ways? Today, people in society are all focused on the soaring price of gold and the rising price of white rice. Speculators are strutting with pride, but who knows that those who bury their heads under the window, cultivating the next generation of citizens for society, are shackled by the yoke of life, and are about to eat soil and drink yellow springs without being understood by people?

Municipal schools cannot accommodate all elementary and secondary school students in the city. This is a matter of fact. As household rice cannot meet the needs of all citizens, the authorities should not ignore the cultivation of private schools, and those with power in society should also rush to help. If they are allowed to live and die on their own, I am afraid that the number of unemployed teachers, out-of-school children, and schools that close down in the next semester will increase with time, creating unexpected contradictions. Is this a blessing for society?

The current difficult problems in education are no longer concealable. In other words, schools cannot help but determine income based on expenditure, and tuition fees are rising; parents cannot help but determine expenditure based on income, causing their children to drop out of school; teachers cannot help but lose their positions due to the decrease in students. The solution is that people in society should quickly rise up to rescue out-of-school children, and the municipal authorities should quickly stop private schools from dismissing teachers without authorization. On the one hand, they should also carefully plan how to subsidize the lives of private school teachers (irregular targeted rations are not enough) and give them stability, so that tuition fees will not rise sharply with prices, and parents can also ease their burden, and children will not be out of school!
