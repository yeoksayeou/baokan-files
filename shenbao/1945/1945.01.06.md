### Japanese Air Force Continues Attacks; Bombs Enemy Airfields and Ships; U.S. Secretary of War Admits Supplies Are Threatened

Japanese Military Base in the Philippines, 5th (Central News Agency) — At the beginning of the new year, Japanese air force units continuously attacked enemy airfields and ships in Tacloban. On the 1st, they sank one enemy medium-sized transport ship and damaged two others in the Sulu Sea. During this attack, they also witnessed an enemy large transport ship that had been burning the previous night explode and sink. This attack caused one fire at an enemy airfield in San Jose and two fires at the Tacloban airfield, one of which exploded. The explosions instantly turned the area into a sea of fire. Japanese army air units, on their way back, sank one enemy small transport ship in the Sulu Sea and bombed the Tacloban airfield on the same day, causing two major fires. Despite this heavy blow, the enemy attempted to reinforce their fighting capacity in San Jose. On the 3rd, they dispatched five 100-ton large transport ships and over sixty small boats to the Sulu Sea. However, two aircraft from the Japanese Kamikaze Special Attack Corps struck, hitting and setting fire to one large ship, while another caught fire and tilted but did not sink. In addition, they sank one enemy 1,000-ton landing craft.

Forward Base in the Philippines, 5th (Central News Agency) — The elite Japanese air force launched a major attack on Mindoro Island on the night of the 3rd. One unit bypassed enemy patrol aircraft, braved intense enemy anti-aircraft fire, and quickly attacked the runway and affiliated facilities at the northern airfield of San Jose, causing two fires and destroying two enemy aircraft on the ground. All Japanese aircraft returned safely to base. Other Japanese aircraft also bombed the airfield.

Forward Base in the Philippines, 5th (Central News Agency) — A Japanese bomber squadron attacked the enemy airfield in Tacloban at dawn on the 2nd, repeatedly carrying out dive-bombing attacks. As a result, seven locations were set on fire and two major explosions occurred, causing heavy damage to the airfield facilities and barracks area. All Japanese aircraft returned safely to base.

Lisbon, 5th (Central News Agency) — According to a Washington dispatch, U.S. Secretary of War Stimson stated at a meeting with reporters on the 4th, regarding the war situation in the Philippines: The Japanese army's attacking power on the Philippines defense line is still very strong. The U.S. military's supply line on Mindoro Island is constantly threatened by Japanese air force bombings. Although the United States has suffered damage in this supply battle, it is continuing to reinforce the front line with supplies.

### Fire at the Head Office of the Bank of Korea

### New Year's Message from Bose, Chairman of the Provisional Government of India

Tokyo, 5th (Central News Agency) — Bose, Chairman of the Provisional Government of Free India, broadcast a New Year's message to various parts of the Greater East Asia region at 7:20 PM on the 4th, expressing the Indian people's determination to expel the British and strive for freedom. The main points are as follows: The Greater East Asia War is being fought for justice and freedom. We will spare no effort to participate in the war to achieve political independence and economic liberation. If we fail to seize this excellent opportunity to restore our inherent freedom, we will inevitably suffer political and economic oppression in the future and fall into the shackles of the United States, which is inheriting British imperialism. This large-scale war is destroying the foundations of the modern world. To overthrow the old order, a long and arduous struggle must take place. We, the Indian people, fully understand the importance of our responsibilities and national crisis, and we also experience the strength and cunning of British imperialism. However, we cannot deny that British imperialism is not easily overthrown with the support of the United States and other Allied nations. We understand the internal corruption of British imperialism, believe in the power of India today and the combat strength of our allies, and believe in ultimate victory. On February 4, 1944, the war that the Indian National Army (i.e., the Indian Liberation Army) had been waiting for is now being fought against Britain and other Allied countries in the Arakan region of Burma. The Indian Independence War is gradually expanding in the border areas of India and Burma and in various places within Indian territory. Today, free Indians can celebrate the New Year with the vow to expel all the British from Indian soil.

Sukarno's Determination

Jakarta, 4th (Central News Agency) — Sukarno, Chairman of the Central Advisory Council of Java, broadcast to various parts of Greater East Asia from the Jakarta Radio Station at 7:30 PM on the 4th, representing the 70 million Indonesian people, expressing their determination to work closely with the East Asian nations to defeat Britain and the United States. The main points are as follows: The 70 million Indonesian people, located on the southernmost front line, vow to live and die together with the Greater East Asian nations to defeat Britain and the United States. The Indonesian people fully understand the significance of this holy war. Japan's righteous pursuit of justice and fairness is the standard of the Five Principles of the Indonesian Spirit during wartime. This program is not only the spirit guiding the Indonesian people in the war but also an unshakable program after the war. Ultimate victory will belong to us. If the nations of China, Japan, Thailand, the Philippines, Burma, India, and Indonesia can unite closely, they will jointly crush Britain and the United States throughout the world. Indonesian youth have now risen to defend their homeland. Hundreds of thousands of young people are either joining suicide squads or joining defense conscript armies, waiting to kill the enemy. But the 70 million Indonesian people are also advancing day and night, strengthening the rear's fighting capacity. Indonesia is determined to follow Japan and the nations of Greater East Asia and resolutely rise up to strive for final victory.

Broadcast Speech by the Deputy Prime Minister of Burma

Rangoon, 4th (Central News Agency) — Burmese Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs, Thakin Mya, exchanged broadcasts with the leaders of the Co-Prosperity Sphere at 7:20 PM on the 4th, expressing the nation's determination, generally stating: The so-called offensive by Britain and the United States is now unfolding in the Pacific and Burma. This year will be a year of fierce struggle. We are facing a decisive stage in the historical struggle. We will further strengthen our determination to fight. In the past, we have achieved many military and political results. The Burmese people, like the Japanese and other peoples, possess military strength. In particular, the unique fighting spirit of the Japanese Kamikaze Special Attack Corps is superior to everything else in war. At this beginning of the fourth year, we will work together to deliver the final blow to the enemy that cannot be remedied. This is the determination of the Burmese people in the new year, and it is also the determination of all East Asian nations.

### The Touchstone for Clarifying Officialdom

— Chen Binhe

Yesterday, five organizations, including the Shanghai Special City Advisory Committee, held a tea party to welcome Acting Chairman Chen. I participated in the event and delivered a speech, which is reproduced below:

Today, various organizations in Shanghai are welcoming Acting Chairman Chen, firstly to express gratitude for Acting Chairman Chen's past achievements in Shanghai, and secondly to express our hopes for Acting Chairman Chen's future aspirations. Mr. Li Zanhuh has already explained this very clearly. I would like to take this opportunity to say a few words from the standpoint of a citizen.

It is undeniable that the general situation in the entire peace zone is not entirely satisfactory. On the other hand, the demands of the current situation are extremely urgent and pressing. Therefore, the current situation cannot meet the demands of the times. This is an extremely dangerous phenomenon.

Why has such a dangerous phenomenon formed within the peace zone? In summary, it is due to the lack of political power. Of course, this has been forming gradually for a long time. We believe that the leadership has been closely monitoring these phenomena and is determined to rectify them. This can be seen in the repeated instructions issued by Acting Chairman Chen since he took charge of the central government. For example, in the key points that Acting Chairman Chen presented in his inaugural address last year and his New Year's address this year: The third point said "Resolved to clarify officialdom." The fifth point said "In government, we should value integrity, implement construction, and not only need to be steadfast, but also need to move forward." These are all suggestions for political reform.

We have always advocated reforming politics, which in practice means clarifying officialdom. We believe that there are two major enemies in politics today: one is corruption in officialdom, and the other is profiteering in society. If these two major enemies are not thoroughly eradicated, then politics will never be clear and prices will never be stable. Clarifying officialdom is naturally a major undertaking. However, we can now use the ability to accomplish the smallest two things as a touchstone for whether we can clarify officialdom in the future. The first is to strictly prohibit extortion by military police in various places. Think about what extortion is. What is it if it is carried out by people wearing national uniforms? In the past, *lijin* (internal transit taxes) were considered the most troublesome and harsh taxes on the people, but they were abolished with determination. The harassment of extortion now is ten to a hundred times greater than *lijin*. If the government can have the determination to concentrate its forces to eliminate extortion first, it would not be difficult. Let's assume a three-month period for eliminating this. The second is to ban the arrogance of the "black hats" at the train stations. The "black hats" are just small servants at the stations. Is it possible that the power of politics is less than the power of the "black hats"? Although these are employees of the North China Railway and should be the responsibility of the North China Railway, if the North China Railway does not have the ability to ban them, then our government cannot sit idly by and should intervene and ban them. Government officials traveling on the Beijing-Shanghai and Beijing-Ping lines, who has not witnessed this firsthand and felt disgust? Let's assume a one-month period for banning this. If these two small things cannot be done in one month, cannot be done in three months, then all other work to clarify officialdom and reform politics will become empty talk.

Secondly, Acting Chairman Chen also said that today production has gradually stagnated. It is undeniable that in the future, we must attach equal importance to both military and civilian needs, in order to encourage people to devote themselves to the continuation of production. We admire the accuracy of this observation and judgment. Our country's participation in the war can only lean toward economic cooperation, so we must emphasize production. The three provinces and two cities in the peace zone are the wealthiest regions, and it is truly unjustifiable that they have now reached a state of production stagnation. If this is due to the inconvenience of transportation, or the obstacles of certain unreasonable measures in the planned economy, then we should study the interests with the relevant authorities of the Allied nations and use all our strength to overcome this difficulty. The biggest problem at present is the reduction in agricultural production. Therefore, the most important thing to increase agricultural production is to alleviate the suffering of farmers and provide them with the daily necessities they need. To secure the source of these goods, we must emphasize light industrial production. The coordination of agricultural and industrial production is a cycle. We hope that the government will promptly promulgate implementation measures to encourage farmers to increase production, and that there will be an overall plan for all industrial production, with half of the industry turning to military needs to fulfill the task of economic cooperation in the war, and the other half used for civilian needs, and that most of the produced materials will be circulated to rural areas to exchange for agricultural products. Only in this way can we achieve the goal of encouraging people to devote themselves to the continuation of production.

What we need in a political leader is someone who is just, broad-minded, and profound. We believe that Acting Chairman Chen has all of these qualities, and we cannot help but express our fervent hopes.

### Raids on Taiwan and Ryukyu; Enemy American Fighting Spirit Declining; Salt Field Captain Talks About the Pacific War Situation

The joint press conference held by the Allied Japanese authorities, land, sea, and air in Shanghai was held yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM on the fifth floor of the Huizhong Hotel on Nanjing Road. Navy Press Department member Captain Shiota was present. He instructed Lin Junfu, Wang Bingnan, Liu Zhennan, etc. Captain Shiota, representing Minister Matsushima, gave a speech on the spot, explaining the anxiety and distress of the enemy Americans in the Pacific Philippines, especially the recent decline in fighting spirit in the raids on Taiwan and Ryukyu. In addition, he explained that the resources of the Americans are quite exhausted. The details are as follows:

Weak Fighting Spirit in Raids on Taiwan

The U.S. military, judging that the Philippines operation has made no progress, as a result of anxiety, launched raids on Taiwan and Ryukyu on the 4th using carrier-based aircraft and land-based aircraft. Compared with the raids in October last year, the number has decreased significantly, and the attack methods are also very inferior, as if they were practice battles. Therefore, our important facilities have not been damaged in the slightest. The most significant phenomenon of this raid is the weak fighting spirit of the enemy. Therefore, we imagine that most of the aircraft participating in this operation were flying squads that had not been trained enough. The above refers to carrier-based aircraft. As for land-based aircraft, they fled in a panic without dropping bombs. From this, it can be seen that the enemy's move is nothing more than a scare tactic.

Future War Situation is Important

Of course, the enemy's operational goal is to attack Taiwan in the hopes of cutting off the Philippines supply lines. At the same time, it wishes to discover the movements of the U.S. Navy and transport convoys in the Palau Islands. This operation is a preparatory work for the next operation. As for whether the enemy will go to Luzon Island or other locations in the next operation, it can only be determined by how the situation changes. The enemy hopes to open up the current war situation at this time, so the future war situation is very important. Secondly, regarding the British side, it is still difficult to determine how the British Pacific Fleet will cooperate in this operation. However, from all aspects, the Philippines front has intensified from the beginning of the new year. The Japanese side is making preparations for operations, and there will continue to be great victories in the future battles on the Philippines, which you can look forward to.

The Hearts of the People in the Philippines Are Extremely Stable

After Captain Shiota finished speaking on behalf of Minister Matsushima, he spoke about the situation on the Philippines front, saying that according to people who recently came from the Philippines, although the Philippines is constantly bombed by the enemy, the hearts of the people are still extremely stable. Of course, materials are not as abundant as before, and prices are also quite high, but the people's hearts are not shaken. Especially after the enemy landed on Leyte Island, not only were the general public not shaken, they enthusiastically assisted the Japanese army in combat. MacArthur's headquarters issued a warning to the general public stating: If there are Filipinos who help the Japanese army, they will all be killed. Originally, the enemy's first plan for this operation in the Philippines was to expect Filipinos to help them, but the result was the opposite. Therefore, the enemy issued this order in anger. The Japanese in the Philippines have a strong fighting spirit and are completely in line with the Japanese army. Local production in the Philippines has reached a considerable level, and weapons can also be repaired locally.

Enemy British Fleet Incapable of Combat

In addition, regarding what enemy General Fraser said: The British Pacific Fleet, although obeying the orders of the British government, must take its command from the enemy Americans in the Pacific, and in terms of strength, it must also be balanced and not exceed the U.S. fleet. Yesterday, the enemy released news stating: The British Pacific Fleet is linked to the Seventh Fleet, indicating that the British Pacific Fleet is responsible for protecting the supply lines to Australia. Therefore, it is judged that the British fleet would never dare to fight the Japanese fleet and does not have a large military force. Today, the army's new aircraft will appear, surpassing enemy American aircraft in speed and quickly. The production of enemy American bombers, the B2429 type, and the p51 type fighter jets has sharply decreased, decreasing by an average of more than 1,000 aircraft per month. The reason is actually due to the insufficient labor force. In order to solve the problem of human resources and protect military strength, the enemy American does not hesitate to reduce the rear's productive workforce and replace it with machines to increase production. According to the former U.S. Production Bureau's Mobilization Bureau, it still boasted to the general public about the vast size of its productivity, but the most difficult thing is the lack of human resources. It deeply hopes that the people will cooperate, otherwise it will be difficult to win the war against Japan. Since the start of the war, the U.S. has rarely made such remarks. Now, because it has driven all human resources to the front line, it is using sweet words and deception. Furthermore, according to yesterday's German news agency, the United States has drafted farmers aged eighteen to twenty-eight into military service, and is deeply anxious about the suffering of its own human resources. Japan, on the other hand, has only dispatched half of its army and navy overseas, which shows the might of the Japanese army.

### Japanese Cabinet Approves Tax Increase Outline

Tokyo, 5th (Central News Agency) — The Japanese government has carefully reviewed the tax policy for the next year, first reviewing the general accounting budget of 22.244 billion yen for the next year and the recently decided additional budget for temporary military expenditures, and at the same time, in order to strengthen wartime finances and absorb general floating buying power, it has decided to implement a tax increase policy of 1.8 billion yen annually. This was approved in the cabinet meeting on the 4th. As for the contents of the tax increase outline, it has been decided to announce it on the 5th. After the draft of the tax increase outline has been sorted out, it will be endorsed in the cabinet meeting on the 22nd, and will be formally approved as a legal outline. The targets of this tax increase are the classified income tax law, the special tax law, and income taxes, which are direct taxes, and liquor tax and transit taxes, which are indirect taxes.

### Outline for the Allocation of Increased Production Subsidies to Cooperatives This Year

Nanjing, 5th (Central News Agency) — In order to quickly allocate agricultural increased production subsidies this year, fully exert the function of cooperatives, and promote increased production work, the Agricultural Increased Production Promotion Committee of the Executive Yuan has formulated the "Outline for the Allocation of Agricultural Increased Production Subsidies to Cooperatives in the 34th Year of the Republic" and the details have been passed by the committee and promulgated for implementation. The contents of the outline include:

(2) The methods for allocating the subsidies are as follows: (A) Each county and district cooperative branch applying for subsidies should fill out an application form and business plan in six copies and send them to the relevant authorities. (B) Each relevant authority will send one representative to jointly review the matters. The application form and business plan can only be forwarded for collection after approval. (C) When reviewing the application form mentioned above, in addition to sending personnel to conduct on-site investigations as a reference for approval, each authority may also form a supervisory team and send it to the area to supervise the increased production work.

(3) The subsidies for cooperative technicians and township agricultural promotion associations under the increased production subsidy items shall be issued for two months in advance in principle.

(4) The subsidies for the training of agricultural instructors for key farmer cooperatives under the increased production subsidy items should be allocated with reference to the investigation reports of the supervisory team.

(5) Other increased production subsidies may be allocated in advance for the necessary parts in accordance with the business plan and the investigation reports of the supervisory team.

(6) The committee and relevant authorities may contact and send personnel to review the use of the subsidies by the cooperative at any time.

### New People's Society Holds Meeting

Beiping, 5th (Central News Agency) — In order to handle the proposals of the joint conference of the entire body in the 33rd year of the Republic of China and to discuss the implementation plan in order to fulfill the mission of increased production and transportation borne by North China as a rear base, the Central Headquarters of the New People's Society held a meeting at the society this afternoon (5th) to discuss the handling plan for the proposals.

### Director of Intelligence Department, Kishi, Returns to Nanjing; Expresses Impressions of Hankou; Hankou's Air Defense Facilities Are Extremely Complete

Nanjing, 5th (Central News Agency) — Director of the Intelligence Department of the Japanese Embassy, Mr. Kishi Ichi, recently went to Hankou on official business and returned to Nanjing on New Year's Day. Yesterday, he met with a group of reporters at his official residence and expressed his impressions of the air defense situation of Japanese residents in Hankou under bombing: The Japanese residents in Hankou, under blind bombing, under the guidance of Consul General Nakano and other officials, are actively engaged in reconstruction work, and their spirit is admirable. The local Japanese army and navy authorities have repeatedly provided them with convenience and assistance, which is especially appreciated. In the air raid on December 18, there were very few casualties among the Japanese residents. The main reason is that the air defense facilities are complete and the usual training is sufficient. Even after the blind bombing, they were able to respond calmly, as if they were practicing. We deeply feel that organized air defense is the most important work in air defense, and we especially hope that the equipment of air-raid shelters in various places can be improved in the future.

### The Headquarters of the First Area Army Moves to Suzhou; Each Army and Division Still Stationed in Original Defenses

Nanjing, 5th (Central News Agency) — Commander-in-Chief of the First Area Army, Mr. Ren Yuandao, since concurrently serving as Governor of Jiangsu Province and Pacification Director stationed in Suzhou, has worked hard to unify the military and administration of the entire province. Currently, because the headquarters of the First Area Army was originally located in Nanjing, and now in order to facilitate command and office work, he has specially moved the headquarters of the First Area Army to Suzhou. As for the remaining armies and divisions, they will still be stationed in their original defenses and will not be changed. In order to facilitate liaison with the central authorities, the First Area Army Headquarters Liaison Office will be established at the original site of the headquarters in Nanjing. It is heard that the candidate for the director of the Liaison Office of the headquarters will be formally announced in the near future.

### Sun Liangcheng's Troops Transfer to Northern Jiangsu

(Central News Agency, Shanghai) General Sun Liangcheng, concurrently the Pacification Director of Northern Jiangsu and Commander-in-Chief of the Second Route Army, has been ordered to transfer his troops. He personally led his elite soldiers from Henan to Taizhou, suppressing bandit troops and pacifying the people along the way. With a firm belief in "Revitalizing Asia and Protecting China," he completed the troop transfer mission. According to someone from Northern Jiangsu yesterday, after General Sun arrived in Jiangsu, he met with Chen Caifu, commander of the 26th Division stationed in Jiangsu, and Sun Yutian, commander of the 38th Division, in Yancheng. They were warmly welcomed by the local people. When General Sun's troops marched into Northern Jiangsu along the Longhai Railway line, they engaged in a fierce battle near Funing, Xiangshui, and Jiang with the main force of the communist Old Eighth Route Army. Because the officers and soldiers fought bravely, they finally defeated the bandit troops completely, inflicting countless casualties. The strength of the communist bandits in Northern Jiangsu has been greatly weakened by this blow. The coerced militiamen have successively repented and returned. The officers and soldiers used the militiamen as guides to thoroughly eliminate the bandit strongholds and implement a policy of both suppression and appeasement. To plan the establishment of strongholds, he specially accompanied General Chen Caifu, who has been stationed in Jiangsu for eight years, to inspect Wu Gu Zhao Zhuang, Dongtai, Haizhou, Taizhou and other places, while also investigating popular sentiment. He was warmly welcomed by the local people and attended public rallies to express sympathy to the people in various places, encouraging them to follow national policies wholeheartedly, so as to achieve the goal of military-civilian unity in completing the war effort and realizing the late Chairman Wang's legacy.

### Soviet Artillery Bombardment, Fierce Attack on Buda-Pest, German Troops Still Defend Underground Fortress

(Central News Agency, Stockholm, 5th) Soviet troops occupied the high ground around Budapest and began bombarding German strongholds with rocket artillery starting on the first. According to a Reuters dispatch from Moscow, German positions were located in the basements of tall buildings and connected by deep trenches, making them veritable underground fortresses. The intense Soviet bombardment appeared to be ineffective. Soviet forces continued to increase their explosive power and on the third had occupied most of the Buda district west of the city, up to the Danube's west bank, Mido Ros Home Di, and Ma Xing Jia Li Tai Bridge. German air forces in the skies above the city constantly attacked Soviet supply lines and, starting on the second, began to supply German strongholds besieged by Soviet forces from the air.

German Troops Maintain Initiative

(Central News Agency, Berlin, 5th) Highton News Agency: Since Marshal Rundstedt seized the initiative on December 16th of last year, he has maintained this advantage. The situation on the Western Front can be described in the following five points: (1) The German offensive between the Moselle and Meuse rivers has scattered the US First Army. (2) Eisenhower had to urgently transfer General Patton's Second Army from the Saar front to the gap in Belgium to protect the northern flank of the anti-Axis forces from threats. Therefore, the threat to the German forces on the Saar front has now been lifted. (3) The US Seventh Army also had to take over the front line formerly defended by the US Third Army. The American and Seventh Armies south of Balaton were forced to withdraw from the land they had captured at great cost outside the Maginot Line and the German West Wall. (4) The German West Wall defenses are far stronger than the enemy imagined, so German troops were able to launch a counter-offensive and halt their advance. (5) German morale is high, and they have achieved a balance in military equipment production, so the war situation is favorable to the German forces.

### Anti-Axis Forces in Italy for the Po River Plain

Dispatching Forces of Twenty Divisions

(Central News Agency, Berlin, 5th) In order to compete for the strategically important Po River Plain, the anti-Axis forces have dispatched as many as twenty divisions. The commander-in-chief of the anti-Axis forces in the Mediterranean region is attempting to gradually break through the Apennine valleys and directly approach the southwestern corner of the Po Plain. Although the enemy has deployed large numbers of tanks and ordnance in this area, they have not been able to complete the encirclement. German generals are responding effectively, and enemy advances have repeatedly failed.

### Soviet Union May Recognize Polish Provisional Government

Anglo-American Attitude Worthy of Attention

(Central News Agency, Stockholm, 5th) Highton News Agency, Moscow: Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov met yesterday with the leader of the "Hungarian Provisional Government" delegation, Li Ang Ge Qi.

(Central News Agency, Stockholm, 5th) German News Agency: According to the Swedish Daily Newspaper, although London had hoped that the Soviet Union would not recognize the Lublin Polish government before the anti-Axis three-nation conference discusses the Polish issue, if the Ukrainian, Byelorussian, and Latvian Soviet Republics have already recognized the Lublin government, then the Soviet Union's recognition of that government is only a matter of time.

(Central News Agency, Stockholm, 5th) German News Agency, London: The Polish Peasant Party, led by former Prime Minister Mikolajczyk, issued a statement saying that if Britain, the United States, and France recognize the Lublin Committee, it would be tantamount to approving the establishment of a communist Poland. A communist Poland will soon be incorporated into the Soviet Union, and with the consent of Britain, the United States, and France, its independence, freedom, and strength will be destroyed.

### British Conservative Party Congress Postponed

(Central News Agency, Stockholm, 5th) Highton News Agency citing London: The British Conservative Party Congress, originally scheduled to be held from January 29th to 31st, has now been postponed to March 14th to 15th. This news has caused a stir in political circles. It is said that Roosevelt, Churchill, and Stalin will hold a meeting at the end of this month, and if the congress is not postponed, Churchill and Eden will be unable to attend.

### German Navy's Battle Achievements Last Month

(Central News Agency, Berlin, 5th) The German Führer's headquarters announced on the 4th: In combat during December, the German Navy sank six hundred tons, sixteen destroyer escorts.

### The Decisive Battle Politics of the Capital and the New Year

— Special Correspondent of This Newspaper, Dan Ming

The 34th year of the Republic of China is the year of the final decisive battle between the Axis and anti-Axis camps. Therefore, on New Year's Day entering this year, we can see that the Chinese people, both government and public, are showing a kind of resolute new spirit. Especially in our country's capital, although brilliant national flags are fluttering in the clear sky, the people of the whole city are enduring a difficult life and expressing deep expectations for the government's decisive battle politics.

Simple Government Celebrations

As usual, on New Year's Day, the National Government holds a celebration in the National Government Auditorium, gathering high-ranking civil and military officials from across the country. Although they did not stop New Year's greetings like the Allied agencies in China, the celebration held that day was also very simple. Acting Chairman Chen simply read aloud the prepared New Year's instructions. Chen's face was visibly slightly older, and in his steady steps, one could see that he was making courageous plans for the future fate of our country. Since Chairman Wang's death, he has consistently adhered to the firm belief that the country must be unified and the party indivisible, inheriting the consistently policy of the past, which is truly worthy of our admiration. Because it is the year of the decisive battle, the New Year's celebration was completed in a simple and solemn atmosphere, lasting only about twenty or thirty minutes. There were particularly few news reporters present that day. Especially unexpectedly, reporters from our country's newspapers and news agencies did not go, and Japanese reporters were not seen either. Exceptions included a reporter and a special correspondent from the New Shen Bao stationed in Beijing, as well as two reporters from a German news agency. At the same time, during the New Year's celebration every year, in addition to news reporters, there are often cinematographers from film companies and press photographers, but their presence was also not seen this time.

The Memorable Ningyuan Building

Since I had arrived at the National Government, I talked with several acquaintances officials. I learned that the Executive Yuan is located behind the National Government Auditorium. After Acting Chairman Chen concurrently served as the head of the Yuan, he has now set up an office for the head of the Yuan. Because Chairman Wang used to work in his residence, there was no such office before. However, before this office was set up! Acting Chairman Chen used to meet with important figures at Ningyuan Building, and the Executive Yuan meetings and Supreme National Defense Council meetings were also moved here from Chairman Wang's residence. Originally, Ningyuan Building was behind the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and used to be where the National Government received foreign guests. What is especially memorable is that the signing of all treaties with the Allied powers after the National Government's return to the capital was held there. The reporter lingered there for a long time, thinking of the late Chairman Wang's magnificent achievements during his lifetime, truly feeling the peach blossom human face! To the right of the National Government Auditorium was originally the Legislative Yuan, but due to personnel changes, it has now been changed to the Control Yuan!

Quiet in Personnel Changes

Staying in the capital during the New Year, I felt particularly lonely this time. Most of the important officials of the National Government have gone to Shanghai, although the agencies only had one day of holiday. It is said that Acting Chairman Chen will also go to Shanghai for the handover of the municipal government, and with the personnel changes in the Shanghai municipal government, most of those who are pursuing their careers in the officialdom have also set their sights on Shanghai. Speaking of the capital, in the partial personnel changes in the Executive Yuan this time, the Minister of Propaganda was replaced. However, because Minister Lin was transferred to the Governor of Anhui Province, it is said that the original staff will also follow him. Therefore, before the new minister has arrived, the atmosphere in the capital is becoming more and more quiet! I don't know whether these personnel changes can lead our country's politics to a more clear stage. When Acting Chairman Chen went to take over the Shanghai municipal government before, it is said that all the government cars were driven away. Perhaps there has been progress after two or three years! As a reporter, I am, of course, more concerned about the future of the propaganda industry. If the establishment of the China News Association today leads to a new unity of reporters, then the new propaganda authorities should fulfill their new propaganda mission at this crucial juncture of the decisive battle.

New Construction of Rural Autonomy

I unintentionally ran into a former student of mine on the street. He is now the district chief of a certain district in Lishui. I heard many things about the "New Fourth Blaze" from him. The "New Fourth Army" is called the bandit army, but in reality, it is all affected by the official oppression of the people's rebellion. Now, it is said that there is peace in the places where these "bandit armies" are located. However, they unanimously rise up to arrest those who abuse their power for personal gain. From this point of view, the corrupt officials under the National Government's rule are actually only being restrained by the "bandit army" today, which is truly heartbreaking. It is said that Acting Chairman Chen has mustered up his determination to purify the officialdom since the Allied powers returned to the capital. His approach is to start by reorganizing rural township administration and autonomous groups. The National Government will have new plans for the Baojia system in townships and will promulgate unified regulations. Rural construction will begin with the three methods of self-defense, self-government, and self-sufficiency. If our country can quickly establish such a strongman team with three missions, the reporter firmly believes that bandit troubles may be reduced a lot. In addition, we now have only one thing that needs to be worked hard, that is, currency must be linked to production, otherwise, the result of continuing to increase the issuance of currency is quite dangerous in the future. Because the treatment of National Government civil servants will soon be improved, but this kind of palliative method is not a fundamental solution. The only method of relief is to adopt a production standard. Although the New Year is quiet in the capital, the light of its new efforts is gradually emerging. We hope that Acting Chairman Chen and his comrades will boldly do it! (Sent from Nanjing on January 2nd) Stacks of Japanese Shell Production

They specially jointly held a welcome tea party at the Cathay Mansions on Changle Road at 4:00 PM yesterday (the 5th) on the occasion of his visit to Shanghai for official business. High-ranking officials of the National Government, directors of various bureaus of the municipal government, leaders from all walks of life, Ding Shou Cun, Ding Fu Bao, You Huai Bi, Wang Huai Lian, Wang Hai Bo, Wang Shi Yuan, Wang Bo Yuan, Gan Dou Nan, Zhu Kong Jia, Zhu Bo Quan, He Wu Liang, He Zhuo Xian, Li Shou Hei, Li Zu Gui, Shen Chang Geng, Shen Si Liang, Wang Xiao Shui, Zhou Yu Ying, Zhou Bang Jun, Shao Shi Jun, Shao Shu Hua, Jin Xiong Bai, Shuai Bo Chun, Lin Bai Sheng, Wu Huan Zhai, Wu Yong An, Wu Song Gao, Wu Kai Sheng, Wu Guo Zhang, Hu Yi Yi, Jiang Xi Yuan, Sun Li Fu, Sun Zhong Li, Yin Zi Bai, Xu Bu Sun, Xu Tian Shen, Xu Tie Shan, Ma Run Fang, Yuan Hou Zhi, Yuan Jun Chang, Zhang Jun, Chen Shao Gui, Chen Ya Fu, Chen Zhong Fu, Chen Ri Ping, Chen Bo Fan, Zhang En Lin, Zhang Su Min, Zhang De Qin, Huang Jing Qi, Huang Xuan Ping, Huang Yu Zhai, Xu Li Qiu, Xu Guan Qun, Xu Xiao Chu, Feng Bing Nan, Xiang Kang Yuan, Yang Wu Sheng, Huang Di Sheng, Ye Fu, Liu Yang Shan, Liu Jing Ji, Zhao Zheng Ping, Xiong Jian Dong, Pei Yun Qing, Liao Jia Nan, Pan Bing Chen, Lu Feng, Dai Ai Lu, Dai Ying Fu, Wei Shan Fu, Luo Ne Zhai, Su Cheng De, Gu Yu Qi, Gu Nan Qun, and others, more than 400 people in total, attended and were warmly received by Li Si Hao, Wen Lan Ting, Yuan Lu Deng, Lin Kang Hou, and Chen Bin He, representatives of the five organizations.

At exactly 4:00 PM, Acting Chairman Chen gracefully arrived, performed the ritual, and first the chairman of the conference, Li Si Hao, delivered a welcoming speech. Then, the presidium presented a commemorative cup, followed by Acting Chairman Chen delivering instructions. His words were earnest and inspiring, with many encouragements, which deeply moved the listeners, and applause broke out like thunder. Afterwards, Chen Bin He, the representative of the presidium, gave a speech. Finally, refreshments were served, and the meeting ended in a warm atmosphere at around 5:00 PM.

Li Sihao

Chairman's Speech

Acting Chairman Chen, distinguished officials, distinguished guests, today, the Municipal Advisory Committee, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the Municipal Welfare Association, the Charity Group, the Shanghai Branch of the News Association, and other organizations, are holding a tea party to welcome Acting Chairman Chen on the occasion of his visit to Shanghai. We are very honored by your presence. Acting Chairman Chen served as the Mayor of Shanghai for four years, during which he made arduous efforts for the restoration and construction of Shanghai. In particular, the negotiations and reception of the concessions, the completion of the unification of the municipality, were the most glorious page in his political achievements. Standing in the position of the citizens of Shanghai, we express our sincere gratitude. Now that Acting Chairman Chen has left the position of Mayor of Shanghai, we have a sense of regret, but in the future, he will assume greater responsibilities in the central government, and he will certainly be more active in guiding the construction of this city. We hope that Acting Chairman Chen will continue to uphold his loyal and patriotic aspirations, start anew with the people, innovate politics, and take increasing production, stabilizing people's livelihoods, and establishing public security as the starting point to gradually put politics on the right track. We wish Acting Chairman Chen good health, a prosperous career, and good fortune to the country.

Acting Chairman

Instructional Address

Acting Chairman Chen then delivered his instructional address. His words were earnest. First, he expressed his gratitude for the warm reception of the various organizations. He then said: "In the past few years, there has not been much success in the work I have done. I have made no contribution to the country, and I have not been able to help Mr. Wang." In the middle, when he mentioned Mr. Wang's spirit of "forgetting oneself for the country" and "having the country but no self" in the past ten years, Mr. Chen's eyes were filled with tears, which deeply moved the listeners. Finally, he said: "I have been in Shanghai for more than four years, and I have been determined from the beginning to only seek merit and not be afraid of mistakes. However, I have not seen any merits in the past four years, but I have made many mistakes, and I am deeply ashamed. Although everyone can forgive me, I cannot forgive myself. In the future, the situation will become increasingly serious, and I dare not say that I am confident in completing everyone's expectations. I only hope to follow Mr. Wang's spirit of "forgetting oneself for the country" and "having the country but no self," and continue the unfinished business. As long as China can achieve peaceful unification, I will not shirk difficulties and will not hesitate to sacrifice. This is something I can responsibly tell everyone, tell all the citizens of Shanghai, and even the 450 million compatriots across the country."

### Entertainment Venues Strictly Prohibited from Operating Overtime

In order to control electricity consumption and adapt to the wartime system, the municipal authorities have long stipulated and announced the operating hours and electricity usage times of various industries and ordered the Municipal Police Bureau to strictly supervise various industries to comply. However, at present, some entertainment venues disregard the laws and operate overtime, which is illegal. The Administrative Section of the Bureau ordered the Security Administrative Section to send personnel to various districts to conduct strict investigations on a daily basis starting yesterday (the 4th). Entertainment venues operating overtime will have the overtime time recorded in the investigation register at the time, and the venues will be required to stamp it as proof. They will be severely punished in accordance with the law, and customers staying will also be punished in accordance with Article 37 of the Violation of Police Law.

### Household Coal Briquettes Eagerly Awaiting Distribution

Recently, as the Spring Festival is approaching, the price of firewood and charcoal fuel in this city has soared. Families in the middle and lower classes of citizens are in danger of running out of food. With regard to the distribution of the seventh phase of household coal briquettes, they unanimously hope that the authorities will distribute them early in order to alleviate the serious threat to citizens' fuel supply. After the sixth phase of household coal briquettes was fully distributed, it has been almost two months since then, but there is still no definite distribution date for the seventh phase of coal briquettes, which has turned the black market coal briquettes active, which is contrary to the fundamental purpose of stabilizing people's livelihoods and suppressing prices.

### Directors of Various Bureaus Transferred, Expediting Handover

The 235th meeting of the Executive Yuan of the National Government passed the transfer of the directors of the Finance Bureau, Public Works Bureau, Economic Bureau, the Director of the Goods Allocation Office and the Director of the Special Tax Office for Silk Construction of the Ministry of Finance of Shanghai Special Municipality. After the transfer, the various bureaus and offices have been ordered to expedite the conclusion and prepare for the handover to the successors. The directors of the various bureaus and offices will report to Beijing for instructions and set a date for the respective handovers.

### Yimiao Police Bureau Holds Joint Security Conference

After the re-adjustment of the Baojia in the entire Nanshi District, the newly appointed Baojia chiefs have been officially commissioned to carry out the Baojia mission. The Yimiao Police Sub-Bureau specially convened a joint security conference for the Bao chiefs of the Yimiao District in the conference room of the sub-bureau yesterday afternoon. The conference was presided over by the sub-bureau chief Meng Xianqi, who instructed the new Bao chiefs on various measures to be taken in preventing and controlling the current situation.

### Banks with Cash Flow Problems Stop Check Clearing, No Impact on Financial Consolidation

Since the Ministry of Finance promulgated the guidelines and implemented the strengthening of the financial institutions in this city, financial institutions with generally unsound content and organization have been greatly affected and have successively tried to increase their capital amount and absorb deposits to replenish their reserves in order to meet the requirements of the government's strengthening laws. However, there are occasionally several financial institutions that have not only failed to increase their capital, but also found it difficult to absorb deposits, so they suddenly showed poor cash flow and were unable to cope with their operations. After the operating accounts for the past year were completed and the holiday period expired, the clearing of checks of certain three banks has been suspended by the bank association clearing house, except for the Jianghai Bank, which automatically announced its liquidation because it did not intend to continue operating. This suspension of check clearing is due to the fact that the banks themselves have no good skills to use their operating funds, resulting in this bad phenomenon, and has no impact on the entire finance. On the contrary, it can enhance the credibility of legitimate financial institutions, but it is expected that before the strengthening policy has completed its mission, a large number of illegitimate financial institutions will still have the same situation.

### Police Bureau Regularly Holds Judicial Liaison Meetings

The Judicial Department of the Municipal Police Bureau, in order to strive for the advancement of the entire judicial business of this city, has decided to hold judicial liaison meetings on the 15th of each month starting this month. In addition to the chiefs of the various departments of the department and the directors of the judicial shares of the various sub-bureaus, the heads of the various judicial organs such as the Shanghai District Court, the Shanghai District Prosecutor's Office, and the Shanghai Prison, as well as the various figures in the Shanghai judicial community, will be invited to attend. The judicial business and the various tasks of preventing crime will be discussed in detail to jointly plan the advancement.

### China News Association Shanghai Branch Established - Former News Federation Declared Dissolved

The Shanghai Branch of the China News Association has been established and will begin operations from New Year's Day. The office is located at the former address of the News Federation at 160 Great Shanghai Road. The Association will hold a tea party at the Hua Mao Hotel on Nanjing Road at 4:00 PM today to welcome people from all walks of life and announce its establishment. At the same time, the former Shanghai News Federation is declared dissolved. Declarations are published separately as follows:

Declaration of Dissolution of the Shanghai News Federation

This Federation was established on January 27, 1943, and has been in existence for almost two years. Two years ago, various Chinese and Japanese newspapers in the city collectively felt that in order to fulfill the mission that the news industry should bear, and to strengthen the solidarity of the news industry, it was necessary to take a unified step to jointly promote progress. Therefore, the Federation was specially organized. On the day of its establishment, the primary goal was to promote Pan-Asianism and the national policies of China and Japan, to study the development of the news industry and to exert its performance, and to fulfill the mission of the news industry as the pioneer of the times. At the same time, this was set as the direction of our work. Over the past two years, thanks to the solid guidance of the Chinese and Japanese authorities, the warm care of people from all walks of life, and the efforts and cooperation of colleagues in the industry, especially the harmonious cooperation of colleagues assigned by various newspapers to participate in this Federation, the work of this Federation has been continuously promoted. We are grateful and fortunate for this.

We have tried to review the work done in the past two years and compare it with the initial goal. We cannot help but feel ashamed. Although we have made considerable efforts to promote Pan-Asianism and the national policies of China and Japan, we have not been able to fully meet expectations due to limited capabilities. Regarding the research and development of the news industry, we feel that we have not exerted even one-tenth of our efforts, and we dare not claim to be pioneers of the times. Although limited by the environment where manpower and resources are insufficient, the entire mission of the news industry requires eliminating obstacles and actively promoting progress. Now, the Shanghai Branch of the China News Association has been established to develop the entire Chinese news industry. The establishment of this Federation was originally to meet the needs of the time and place, and its work is exactly the same as that of the News Association, with the same goals. Therefore, it has been decided to dissolve. Colleagues from various newspapers in this Federation will continue to participate in the Association in order to realize the unfinished business of this Federation. This is our declaration.

Declaration of

Establishment of the Shanghai Branch of the China News

Association

The China News Association was established on September 25, 1944. The articles of association stipulate the establishment of branches in various important regions. This Association was established in accordance with the articles of association. Two years ago, the news industry in this city had already organized the Shanghai News Federation in order to jointly promote the mission of the news industry, which is the same as the mission of this Association, and the work is consistent. Therefore, the foundation of this Association has already been laid. In the future, under the guidance of the General Association, we will certainly seek to enrich it further.

When the China News Association was established, a declaration had already been announced, and the work and mission were roughly explained. There is no need to repeat them here. However, Shanghai is the center of national culture and education, and especially the most developed region of the national news industry. In the past, each acted independently, failing to achieve the effect of division of labor and cooperation, and failing to form the power of the center of public opinion. After the establishment of the News Federation, it initially had the scale of a unified step. Now that this Association is officially established, on the one hand, it will continue the unfinished business of the News Federation, and on the other hand, it will follow the instructions of the News Association to promote work. Secondly, in this decisive period of the Greater East Asia War, special attention must be paid to the key points of the decisive battle propaganda. First, emphasize the important relationship between the Greater East Asia War and the life and death of various East Asian countries. If we win, we will coexist. If we lose, we will perish together. Therefore, we must awaken the national determination and firm the belief that we will win. Second, we must require the government to pay attention to public opinion, and the basis of public opinion propaganda should be the interests of the public. If it is beneficial to the country and the people's livelihood, we will promote and praise it. If it is harmful to the country and the people's livelihood, we will not hesitate to remonstrate. Regarding political corruption, social speculation and profiteering, hoarding, and the abnormal phenomena of only caring about private interests and not caring about the public, we will regard them as targets of public criticism, expose them collectively, and leave them nowhere to escape. In short, awakening the deaf and exposing the treacherous and incompetent, guiding society on the right track, and expecting political integrity, increasing national strength, and contributing to the Greater East Asia War, is the general direction of the work of this Association. We respectfully ask people from all walks of life to provide guidance and criticism. This is our declaration.

The important officers of the Association have been determined:

Chairman: Chen Binhe

Standing Directors: Osaka Yoichi, Chu Baoheng, Xu Liqiu,

Jin Xiongbo, Huang Jingzhai, Chen Riping, Yuan Shu, Moriyama Takashi

New Year's City Voice

### The Problem of the Municipal Fiscal Center

— Gu Guodong

The Municipal Government Accounting Office was established in July 1942. For the past two years, its achievements have been remarkable. However, after the merger of the first and eighth districts into the municipal government, many fiscal matters urgently need to be promoted starting this year. Here are some of the key issues concerning the municipal fiscal center:

(1) Compilation of the Municipal General Budget

Since the city took over the concessions and the merger of the first and eighth districts on February 1st of last year, and the incorporation of the first district into the municipal government on August 1st, the municipal administration has become unified. Regarding accounting matters, because the fiscal year had not ended at that time, and because the actual situations of the first and eighth districts in the past were different according to their old practices, it was not possible to merge them by completely eliminating their differences. However, the compilation of the city's general budget for this year should be unified with a single general budget of revenue and expenditure as the principle. The city's budget should not be divided into three parts: "Old First District," "Old Eighth District," and "Old City District," based on past practices. As a result, the city's revenue and expenditure cannot be centrally planned and managed. Consequently, the salaries and benefits of various municipal agencies also vary due to the different revenue and expenditure situations of the three parts, which is not appropriate. The government budget is the basis for implementing policies, so a sound budget is necessary to implement good municipal administration.

(2) Establishment of the Municipal Accounting System

When the Accounting Office was established, the "Shanghai Municipal Government Accounting Regulations" were promulgated, but after several revisions, they have become outdated. They should be redrafted to determine the basis for the implementation of accounting by various municipal agencies. Moreover, after the merger of the first and eighth districts, the three parts of the budget are divided into three sets of accounts. The "Old Eighth District" and "Old City District" are handled in accordance with the municipal accounting regulations. The "Old First District" still uses the accounting system of the former Public Works Department, which leads to divergences in municipal accounting matters. In the future, it is hoped that the design and establishment of the accounting system of various agencies will be clarified and that the "Accounting Regulations" will be redrafted.

(3) Replenishing Municipal Accounting Personnel

From the Accounting Office down to the accounting personnel in charge and assistant accounting personnel in various units and agencies, there are very few specialized talents. The old practice of appointing personnel based on the old practices of officialdom, employing the principles of appointing people from the same hometown or old subordinates, should be abolished. This reduces administrative efficiency and even makes it impossible to clarify accounting matters, to promote accounting smoothly, and to strictly enforce accounting powers. In the future, it is hoped that the Accounting Office and various agencies will employ personnel with accounting knowledge as much as possible as accounting personnel in charge and assistant accounting personnel. If there is a shortage of talent, it may be possible to openly solicit reserves for use. Regulations on the appointment of accounting personnel should be formulated to strengthen personnel management.

(4) Improving the Municipal Accounting Organization

The existing departments within the Accounting Office have not been set up separately according to the different matters. Each department is divided according to the limits of "Old First District," "Old Eighth District," and "Old City District." In order to seek to improve the organization and implement a comprehensive organization that adopts an internal control system, various departments should be set up separately for accounting, budgeting, statistics, auditing, and inspection. In addition, offices for specialists and inspectors should be established. Specialists are responsible for the research of accounting policies and special assignments. Inspectors are responsible for supervising the accounting of various municipal agencies and conducting on-site audits in order to promote and increase the effectiveness of accounting work.

The above points are just a few of the major issues that are related to the municipal fiscal center. All of the city's revenue and expenditure should be calculated and balanced in a unified and centralized manner, making it coordinated and fair. The approval and payment of various expenses should be guided legally and reasonably. All personnel, land, and materials should be statistically detailed and accurate, so that the construction of various projects can be weighed in order of urgency, determining the priorities, gains, and losses, so that public funds are not wasted. Accurate budget preparation, sound accounting system, sufficient accounting personnel, and a sound accounting organization are the urgent tasks of the city's accounting policies at present. We hope that the authorities will pay attention to them.

### Reader Scholarship News - University Students Expand Scholarship Campaign - Full-Effort Charity Performance of "Wealthy Floating Clouds"

University students receiving aid from the Newspaper Reader Scholarship Fund have decided to hold a charity stage play for two days to expand the "Special Fundraising" effort. All proceeds from ticket sales will be used for the scholarship fund. After a long period of preparation, things are finally starting to take shape. The play is "Wealthy Floating Clouds," directed by the famous directors Zuo Lin and Zhang Fa. The play has 20-30 male and female actors and is not limited to scholarship students. More than 300 university students have volunteered. After careful selection by Mr. Zuo Lin, those with acting talent and more stage experience have been selected to participate. They are now actively rehearsing and plan to perform in mid-February. The title of the play, "Wealthy Floating Clouds," can be said to be targeted at reality. Confucius said, "Wealth and honor obtained through injustice are like floating clouds to me." We advise the general "wealthy and honored" officials and businessmen at sea to deeply appreciate this and re-examine their "outlook on life" in order to correct their mistakes. This play is adapted by Mr. Yuan Jun based on a Western, modern, successful philosophical comedy. Readers who have a good memory will remember a famous film called "You Can't Take It With You," which is the same as the play "Wealthy Floating Clouds." At a glance, you can know the excellence of the content of this play and the splendor of the performance. Here, in addition to admiring the enthusiasm of the university students for helping with scholarships, we also hope that people from all walks of life will give sponsorship in order to achieve complete success.

Application Forms

Deadline Tonight

This office began issuing the eighth session application forms and student status certificates based on the receipts issued previously. Yesterday, from morning to evening, schools at all levels, from large to small, sent staff to the center to collect them. A few schools have not yet collected them. We hope that they will come to collect them today and fill in the names and numbers according to the above, and forward them to the scholarship students for careful filling. The schools should then fill in the recommendation letter and return it to this office by January 15 at the latest for review. The student status certificates should be properly preserved and sent to this office after approval to be stamped for solemnity. Universities can give the receipts to the representatives of the scholarship student fellowship to collect them. The eighth session application is temporarily limited to old students who received scholarships in the previous session. New students should postpone their applications. Students of all schools should pay attention.

Xinben Girls' Middle School

Joint Fundraising

A letter from Team B of Senior One of Xinben Girls' Middle School says: "Respected Sirs, our classmates recently read the appeal for aid to students from poor families who are dropping out of school, which was published in your newspaper. We were deeply touched. We, as members of the academic community, could not bear to sit idly by. However, we felt that our own efforts were weak and we could not help much. Therefore, we launched a joint fundraising effort. We have received donations from people from all walks of life, totaling 84,640 yuan, which we respectfully present to fulfill our human duty of mutual assistance. We also hope that students from all schools will respond and alleviate the suffering of young people who are dropping out of school. We hope so."

Women's Ping Pong

Finals Tomorrow

Since this newspaper launched the fundraising campaign for the current scholarship fund, we have received enthusiastic responses and generous donations from all quarters. Zhengxing Girls' Middle School is donating tickets to the finals of the Zhengxing Cup Ping Pong Tournament, which is hosted by the school, to those who donate to the scholarship fund. This is an unprecedented example in the education and sports communities. We hope that people from all walks of life will follow suit and work together to expand the scholarship fund. Zhengxing Girls' Middle School on Luoyang Road has a long history and is serious about running the school. After this newspaper announced the special fundraising plan, the school immediately responded and organized a fundraising team. Its spirit of enthusiasm for helping with scholarships is a model for other schools. The school launched the first Zhengxing Cup Shanghai Women's Individual Ping Pong Championship. Dozens of people signed up to participate. After several group elimination matches, six group champions were produced. The situation in each match was extremely enthusiastic. After two more rounds of the rematch, only the final match between Lin Jinlan and Zhou Ruihua remained in the entire order. The school will hold the finals tomorrow (the 7th) at 2:00 PM at the West Xu Fitness Room on Jing'an Temple Road. All the upstairs tickets were given away completely within one day. People from all walks of life went to donate and ask for tickets in an endless stream. The school's staff have been enthusiastically running around for this all day, and we are deeply touched.

Charity Sale of Cakes

### Proposal to Reduce Enrollment Advertising Costs and Use the Savings for Scholarships

— Li Shanlun

It's the end of the semester again. Students are busy preparing for the end-of-semester exams, and schools are not only handling the end-of-semester matters but also preparing to enroll new students for the next semester. At this time, newspapers are often filled with more than 50 lines of enrollment advertisements, which are published continuously every day. Some schools often publish advertisements from the end of the semester until formal classes begin after the start of the semester, which lasts for more than three weeks, which means a huge amount of money will be spent. According to the recent advertising rates, each long line costs 1,200 yuan, and three lines a day published in two newspapers would cost 7,200 yuan. If the advertisements are published for 20 days, it would cost 144,000 yuan. Isn't this a huge expenditure in the school's total income? If the same price ratio is calculated for 50 days during the summer vacation, it would be equivalent to 360,000 yuan now. With such a huge expenditure, schools have to raise students' tuition to make up for it, while on the other hand, they have to reduce the salaries of teachers and staff and other legitimate expenses to balance their income and expenditure.

With such a huge amount of money, even if we calculate the current advertising costs for the winter vacation, if we use it for student loans, each school could add 10 full-tuition students or 20 half-tuition students, which would benefit both the school and the students. According to statistics, there are more than 300 famous schools in Shanghai. If we calculate the total amount of advertising expenses for 50 schools, there would be 500 free students or 1,000 half-tuition students. If the individual funds of each school are added to the salaries of teachers, assuming an average of 14 teachers per school, each teacher could increase their monthly salary by 2,500 yuan. If we compare the advertising costs during the summer and winter vacations, the statistics would be even more impressive.

Looking at the above facts, we can see that most schools in Shanghai are mismanaging their funds. Moreover, the huge expenditure on advertising costs is also a major factor in the increase in tuition. The sharp increase in tuition is directly proportional to the number of students who are dropping out of school. Although tuition increases, the number of students decreases, and the school's economy may not be affluent, the large number of students who are dropping out of school is an undeniable fact. Moreover, there are several loan students in each school whose chances are funded by enthusiastic donors in society. Can the school waste the donations of everyone on unnecessary items? Of course, it shouldn't.

Schools publish enrollment advertisements because it is related to the future of the school itself. If it weren't for this, the number of students would inevitably decrease. After the end of the semester, the school may not be able to maintain itself, so they publish enrollment advertisements. However, because a few schools are profit-oriented, they continue to publish enrollment advertisements on a large scale after the end of the semester. Once this trend starts, others will follow suit and dare not fall behind, creating a competitive situation. Seeing the huge expenditure on advertising costs, it is certainly not their intention. If schools in Shanghai unite and plan to publish enrollment advertisements, they will be able to turn hostility into friendship and turn waste into reality. In my opinion, schools should unite and formulate a plan to publish enrollment advertisements in groups on any day of the week in newspaper A or newspaper B. This will allow readers to have an equal opportunity to find them. The location does not need to be as grand as before. It is only necessary to create an enrollment column in the classified ads. The content should be concise, only listing the class, department, exam date, and school address. Schools with similar characteristics can even publish together. If the above plan can be implemented, advertising costs can be reduced by more than 20 times. The money saved can be used to increase teachers' salaries or directly reduce tuition, which are all good things. The school will not lose anything. On the newspaper side, although they will lose some income, I think the wise newspaper authorities will not hesitate to do so and will not worry about this income. I am writing this in the midst of requests for instructions on tuition standards, hoping that it will be used as a reference and encouragement to make it a reality, which would be a great blessing for students.

### Children's Welfare Association - Merger of Two Institutions

The Shanghai Children's Welfare Association wrote: "Respected Sirs, after the outbreak of the war, we realized that many children were displaced due to the impact of the war, so we established the Children's Welfare Institute on Bailinan Road to accommodate a large number of homeless children. In addition to education and upbringing, we also provide various production skills. Since its establishment, we have received support from all walks of life. In 1940, in order to meet the actual needs, we established a second institute at 519 Liyuan Road, Nanshi (formerly Huile Garden), which has been in operation for five years. However, our association has no funds. The source of funds depends entirely on the continuous assistance of enthusiastic people from all walks of life. We have benefited endlessly over the years, for which we are deeply grateful.

However, in recent years, the cost of living has risen sharply, and prices have soared. The number of children in the institute has also increased, and the daily supply is huge. There is often a danger of running out of food. Although our colleagues have tried their best to find resources, there is still a trend of 'difficult to sustain.' Therefore, in order to reduce daily expenses and facilitate operations, we have implemented a merger before Christmas. All the children from the original first institute have been moved to the address of the second institute in Nanshi. In the future, we still hope that charitable people from all walks of life will continue to provide assistance and funding to save these lambs without parents. If you would like to donate money or goods, please send them to the institute on Liyuan Road, Nanchang, and we hope that you will visit the institute at any time to provide guidance."

### Responding to Midwifery

Mr. Wang Yangwu wrote: "Respected Sirs, I recently read the news that Mr. Wang Shenglan donated money to benefit poor pregnant women. After admiring it, I deeply feel that this move is indeed necessary, so I specially donate 5,000 yuan to help poor pregnant women at the Huisheng Hospital. Please follow the procedures you have set and have the hospital settle the accounts with you on a monthly basis. Thank you for your trouble."

### Health Association Scheduled to Host Education Community

At this time of the historian's summer vacation, the general living conditions are poor. According to recent statistics, the spread of tuberculosis in this city is extremely rapid. In view of this, the China Health Association is actively promoting tuberculosis prevention X-ray examinations, promoting them to all walks of life, so that the general public can have early diagnosis and prevent problems before they occur to protect the health of the public. Since its implementation, the work has been very intense, and all parties have provided assistance. The association is scheduled to host the authorities of large, medium, and small schools in this city at the Maggie Mansion at 996 Jing'an Temple Road at 3:00 PM on Sunday, the 7th of this month, to discuss how to promote tuberculosis prevention work, which is very important to public health in various schools.

### Donating to Aid Elementary School Teachers' Medical Expenses: Benefitting the Impoverished

Effective Remedy for Frostbite: Yang Benyu's administrative management letter states: "To whom it may concern, I suffered from frostbite, which was cured by rubbing camphor and lanolin. A friend's husband also had it, and testing hawthorn also proved effective. Considering that many people suffer from this disease in winter and it easily leads to ulceration and unbearable pain, I am specially spreading this formula in Guangzhou, hoping fellow sufferers will pay attention to it. The formula is as follows: lanolin 10%, camphor 4%, heat into a salve and apply to the affected area."
