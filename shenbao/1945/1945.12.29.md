### Resolutions of the Three Foreign Ministers Conference: Affirming the Leadership of the National Government to Establish a Unified and Democratic China; Reaffirming the Policy of Non-Interference

[Reuters, London, 28th dispatches] The Chinese government is expected to have received notification of the final communique of the Three Powers Foreign Ministers Conference and has likely expressed agreement with the various clauses listed in the communique. The resolutions of the Three Powers regarding Chinese affairs can be categorized as follows: (1) Affirming the necessity of the National Government in Chongqing to lead the establishment of a unified and democratic China. (2) Affirming the necessity of ending the Chinese civil strife. (3) Affirming the necessity of expanding the participation of democratic elements in the government. (4) The Allied nations must not interfere in China's internal affairs. [United Press, Moscow, 27th dispatches] The resolutions of the Three Foreign Ministers Conference regarding China are as follows:

The three foreign ministers exchanged views on the situation in China. They agreed on the establishment of a unified and democratic China under the rule of the National Government and the cessation of civil war. They also reaffirmed their support for a policy of non-interference in China's internal affairs. Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov and U.S. Secretary of State Byrnes held several talks on the issue of Soviet and American troops stationed in China. Mr. Molotov stated that the Soviet army had disarmed and disbanded the Japanese army in the Northeast, but at the request of the Chinese government, the Soviet army would postpone its withdrawal until February 1, 1946. Mr. Byrnes pointed out that the U.S. military was stationed in China at the request of the Chinese government and mentioned that the United States must fulfill its initial responsibility to implement the surrender terms, disarm and disband the Japanese army. Once the responsibility is discharged, or the Chinese government can assume the responsibility without the need for American assistance, the U.S. military will withdraw. The two foreign ministers agreed that the troops of both the Soviet Union and the United States should withdraw from China at the earliest possible time after completing their missions.

[Our Newspaper Report] A broadcast from San Francisco on the 28th stated: Chinese Minister of Propaganda Wu Guozhen recently declared that the Chinese government has not yet received the full text of the declaration of the Three Powers Foreign Ministers Conference, therefore it is not convenient to announce its attitude.

Joint Control of Japan Was Originally Advocated by Our Country

[United Press, Chongqing, 28th dispatches] Chinese people here express welcome for the Three Powers Foreign Ministers Agreement, especially the agreement regarding China. They all hope that this agreement will safeguard China's sovereignty over the Northeast and promote China's peace and unity. Regarding the agreement on the early withdrawal of American and Soviet troops from China, its significance is twofold: first, the Soviet army was originally scheduled to complete its withdrawal from the Northeast on January 3, which is now bound to be delayed; second, the U.S. military will withdraw as soon as the disarmament and disbandment of the Japanese army is completed. Official sources stated that they will issue opinions after studying this agreement. A spokesperson said that China's inclusion in the United Nations Japan Control Committee is in line with China's wishes. As for the Korean issue, China has always advocated Korean independence.

[Central News Agency, Washington, 28th Special Telegram] It is learned from authoritative sources that regarding the Allied nations' joint control of Japan, the Soviet Union initially proposed that a committee be formed by China, the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union to carry out the control work. The Far Eastern Advisory Commission advocated by the United States includes representatives of all countries directly engaged in war against Japan, but it is purely an advisory body without the power to directly implement or decide on policies. Before the Far Eastern Advisory Commission meeting in November, our government had drafted a compromise proposal. In addition to the aforementioned Advisory Commission, a Japanese Control Committee should be formed by China, the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union. This committee has the power to decide on policies for certain specific matters (such as the Japanese constitution and the Japanese government). However, the power to implement resolutions and command troops should still belong to the Supreme Commander of the Allied Forces. This Chinese compromise proposal was generally agreed to by the United States. The scheme for the control of Japan agreed upon at the Moscow Three Foreign Ministers Conference is largely China's proposal. Therefore, when the foreign ministers of the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union sought our agreement, we readily agreed.

### Control Committee for Japan: Does Not Change MacArthur's Command Authority; Still Holds Leading Position in Administrative Management

[United Press, Moscow, 27th dispatches] The Three Powers Foreign Ministers Conference of the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union concluded successfully today and issued a communique. Regarding the control of Japan, it was decided that the Far Eastern Commission would be organized by representatives of eleven United Nations countries, and the Japan Control Committee would be organized by the four countries of the United States, the Soviet Union, China, and Britain. Once these two committees are established, the Supreme Commander of the United Nations in Japan, General MacArthur, will transfer most of his duties to the respective committees for handling. Any instructions issued by the Commander must be submitted to the Far Eastern Commission for review. The United States will be responsible for drafting various instructions based on the decisions of the committee, and instructions related to fundamental reforms in the organization or government of Japan must be consulted with the committee. Although MacArthur is subject to these restrictions, he still holds a leading position in the administration of Japan and will serve as chairman of the Four Powers Control Committee.

[United Press, Washington, 28th dispatches] The resolutions of the Three Foreign Ministers Conference of Britain and the Soviet Union regarding Japan, in fact, do not change the authority of General MacArthur as the Commander of the United Nations. The mission of the Four Powers Control Committee for Japan is only to provide the commander with consultation and advice, and the United States is one of the four members, and MacArthur is the chairman of the committee. Although the Three Foreign Ministers Agreement increases the power of the Far Eastern Commission to formulate policies, it also stipulates a voting method that can prevent any decisions on Japan that are not approved by the United States. Therefore, the United States can prevent any attempt to change MacArthur's implementation of various instructions. The committee also guarantees respect for the existing Japanese control mechanism, including the command system from the U.S. government to the Supreme Commander's jurisdiction over the occupation forces.

[Central News Agency, Washington, 27th Associated Press] The main reaction to the two points announced by the Three Foreign Ministers Conference, the Far Eastern Commission and the Allied Nations Committee on Japan, is that the Soviet Union has achieved complete success in its demand for equal joint management of Japan. Although there are veto provisions in the voting procedures of the Far Eastern Commission, the Soviet Union can still exert considerable power in the long-term policy towards Japan. Experts particularly pointed out that this agreement has restricted the U.S. government from issuing instructions to the Supreme Commander of the Allied Forces, which should be in accordance with the policies decided by the Far Eastern Commission. Regarding the veto provisions, similar to those stipulated in the San Francisco Conference, there is a clause that "the decisions of the Far Eastern Commission can be implemented without unanimous agreement, but must at least be approved by a majority of representatives, and should include representatives from the four countries of the United States, Britain, the Soviet Union, and China."

[Reuters, London, 28th dispatches] Regarding the resolution on the control of Japan, Washington believes that it is a major concession by the U.S. delegation. Right-wing figures are expected to point out that President Truman and Byrnes have repeatedly insisted that they will not allow the United States' final decisive say on the occupation of Japan to encounter interference. According to the decision of the Moscow Conference, General MacArthur, the Commander of the Allied Forces stationed in Japan, will have leading administrative responsibility, but he will be subject to policy controls, which will be decided by voting. Those who criticize it generally believe that the smoothly working occupation administration to date will be disrupted by the new method. It is heard that the occupation forces of Britain, China, and the Soviet Union will soon be sent to Japan, but their numbers are likely to be quite small, and the main burden of military occupation will still be borne by the United States.

### National Government Orders

### Divided Opinions in Korea on the Allied Trusteeship: Reluctant Acceptance vs. Opposition

[Central News Agency, San Francisco, 27th Associated Press] Han Kil-mo, representing the Korean People's League, told the press that the Korean people reluctantly accept the decision of the Allied nations to establish a joint trusteeship over Korea for five years. The Korean people had hoped to meet the spirit of the Cairo Declaration and obtain a better solution so that Korea could achieve freedom and independence as soon as possible. However, for the sake of world peace and the political stability of Asia, we would rather have a glimmer of light than complete darkness and accept the agreement of the Three Foreign Ministers Conference with a spirit of compromise. We hope that the powers can immediately cancel the division of Korea into two and establish a provisional committee to prepare for the democratic government to be established by the Korean people.

[Associated Press, Seoul, 27th dispatches] A spokesperson for the unofficial Korean government led by Kim Koo today reiterated the demand for immediate independence and opposed the plan for a five-year joint trusteeship of Korea by the Allied nations.

### Japanese War Criminals Who Invaded China: Sakai Will Be Brought to Trial; Admits to Meeting with Communist Party Representatives Twice

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 28th dispatches] After the arrest of Sakai Takashi, a Japanese war criminal who invaded China, a reporter made a special visit to the spokesperson of the Army Headquarters. According to reports, Sakai Takashi served as the battalion commander of the Tianjin Garrison Army during the September 18th Incident. Later, he was transferred to be the chief of staff of the Tianjin Garrison Army of Meijiro Umezu. At that time, the various disturbances in Peiping and Tianjin were all instigated by him, such as the Hebei Incident in 1935, when the Japanese demanded that our troops and party headquarters withdraw from Hebei, as well as the subsequent instigation of the autonomy of the five provinces in North China, were all planned by Sakai. After the July 7th Resistance War, Sakai, with his qualifications as a "China expert," was promoted to commander of the North China Expeditionary Army. The crimes he committed in China are countless, but he had retired the year before last, so he was unknown in this surrender. However, Sakai has always regarded invading China as his way to advancement, so after his retirement, he repeatedly sneaked into China to engage in illegal activities. In early November, when Commander-in-Chief He patrolled Peiping, he learned that Sakai was carrying out a major conspiracy to disrupt North China, and immediately ordered an investigation and arrest. Because Sakai's whereabouts were secret, he could not be captured immediately. On November 29, Commander-in-Chief He also explained when hosting reporters in Chongqing that Sakai was colluding with the Chinese Communist Party and that the facts were being investigated. In order to whitewash their crimes, the Chinese Communist Party published an explicit telegram from Xinhua News Agency Yan'an on December 11, stating that Lieutenant General Sakai and Zhu did not participate in the Communist army's operations. On December 13, the Chongqing Xinhua Daily further falsely accused Commander-in-Chief He of having met with Sakai when he was in Peiping. This kind of behavior of deceiving compatriots is not worth refuting. In early December, Commander-in-Chief He re-issued the previous order, telegraphing Commander Sun Yingzhong of the Eleventh War Zone to quickly search and arrest him. At the same time, he telegraphed Takahashi, a Japanese liaison staff officer in North China, to come to Nanjing to inquire about the situation of Sakai's collusion with the Chinese Communist Party. Takahashi arrived in Nanjing on December 12 and admitted that Sakai had indeed been in constant contact with the Chinese Communist Party and revealed the address where Sakai Takashi was hiding. In mid-December, Commander Sun captured Sakai Takashi and sent personnel to escort him to Nanjing. After preliminary interrogation, Sakai directly admitted that he had attempted to disrupt North China. According to his confession, he had gone to the ancient temple in Wenquan Village, several kilometers west of Heilongtan, a suburb of Peiping, twice on September 7 and 11 to discuss cooperation with Zhang Xueshi, a representative of the Chinese Communist Party. However, because the Chinese Communist Party asked Sakai to find a way to make the Japanese army in North China refuse to surrender, the Japanese army in Peiping and Tianjin were afraid of violating the Potsdam Declaration and Chairman Chiang's orders, which would affect the future of Japan's entire national destiny, and did not dare to accept. At the same time, the National Army quickly arrived in Peiping and Tianjin by air, and Sakai's secret negotiations with the Chinese Communist Party could not be realized. However, Sakai did not give up and secretly lived in the western suburbs of Peiping, trying to revive his ambitions, but was eventually arrested and escorted to Nanjing by our army. He is currently detained in the Nanjing Garrison Command. Sakai is one of the war criminals and will be brought to trial together with other Japanese war criminals.

### Preliminary Hearing of Tianjin Traitors: To Be Sent to Court Immediately

[Central News Agency, Tianjin, 28th dispatches] The traitors detained in Tianjin are still being held separately. They have undergone preliminary hearings and are said to be transferred to the court for public trial in the short term. The Tianjin Branch of the Hebei High Court has not yet received any cases of traitors reported by the people, but the court has filed a public prosecution against Liu Yuzhang, the former president of the puppet Hebei High Court, who was previously arrested.

### President Song Visited Director Li Yesterday and Summoned Chiefs of Peiping and Tianjin: Announcing the Important Work Objectives for Next Year

[Our Newspaper, Peiping, 28th dispatches] President of the Executive Yuan Song Ziwen will stay here for three to five days after arriving in Peiping to solve the political and economic problems of North China.

[Central News Agency, Peiping, 28th dispatches] President Song went to the Military Affairs Commission in the morning to visit Director Li Zongren for consultations. He attended a banquet hosted by Mayor Xiong in the morning. At 4:00 PM in the afternoon, he summoned the chief military and political officials and special commissioners of various departments in Peiping to give instructions at the Qin Zheng Dian in Zhongnanhai. Mayor Xiong Bin of Peiping, Deputy Mayor Zhang Bojin, Mayor Zhang Ting'e of Tianjin, Mayor Du Jianshi, and more than 30 special commissioners from various departments attended. President Song's instructions were roughly as follows: I was ordered to come to Peiping this time to inspect the economic situation and the handling of the receiving of enemy and puppet properties. The most important work for next year is to stabilize finance, stabilize national prices, and restore Chinese and foreign trade in order to suit the country's income and expenditure. The economic, transportation, financial, and food aspects are all actively promoted with this purpose in mind. The receiving and handling of enemy and puppet properties is also extremely important. I hereby request that all military and political agencies in Peiping and Tianjin that are handling the receiving of enemy and puppet assets submit all schedules to me before 4:00 PM on December 30 for review and handling reports to the chairman. In addition, more than a dozen members of the Political Consultative Conference in Peiping have requested President Song to schedule a meeting to present the current situation in North China.

### National Army Arrives Outside Yingkou: Soviet Side Sends Telegram Welcoming Our Advance to Shenyang

[Also Jinzhou, 28th urgent telegram] After the telegram from the Soviet military officer stationed in Xinmin County welcoming our army's advance to Shenyang arrived in Jinzhou, the military and political officials stationed in Jinzhou, Jinzhou, and the general soldiers were very excited.

According to well-informed sources, this Sino-Soviet liaison may be completed quickly, and it is expected that our army will be stationed in Shenyang in the near future. In addition, since our army came out of the pass to take over the defense, although each route has been obstructed by bandit troops, the progress is still very rapid. As of the time of the telegram, there are no traces of bandit troops north of the railway, and farmers have returned to their hometowns one after another to take care of their homes. More than half of the 25 counties under the jurisdiction of Liaoning Province have been taken over by the provincial government.

The movement of Communist troops between Nankou and Zhangjiakou is particularly frequent, and the Communist Party is forcing the people to destroy transportation. In the Jinzhou area, General Du Yuming said that three divisions and one brigade of Communist troops have fled from various places in southern Jiangxi, Shandong, and Hebei to the area north of the Beining Road. These Communist troops are part of the New Fourth Army. There are currently four armies of the National Army in the Northeast, and another six armies will enter the Northeast after the entire area is received, but even with the current four armies, they are able to control the railway lines in the Northeast.

[Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 28th] Taoshanji, located only 23 kilometers from Xuzhou Station on the Puxu section of the Jinpu Railway, was again destroyed by 7,000-8,000 Communist troops at 9:00 PM on the 27th, and the bridges were also destroyed.

### Communist Party Proposes Ceasefire: Government Considering Response, Second KMT-CCP Talks Scheduled for Today

[Our Newspaper Dispatch] A San Francisco broadcast on the 28th stated: The first day of negotiations between the Chinese Kuomintang and the Communist Party resulted in positive outcomes. Wu Guozhen, the Minister of Propaganda, announced that Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek is reviewing the Communist Party's "ceasefire" proposal. A response is expected within days, and the second KMT-CCP talks are scheduled to be held on the 29th.

[Our Newspaper Dispatch] A San Francisco broadcast on the 28th stated: According to reliable sources, the Chinese Communist Party has presented the government with three major demands and eight additional demands. The content of the three major demands is as follows: (1) An immediate and unconditional cessation of hostilities between both sides within China and Northeast China. (2) All military and political issues between the parties can be resolved after a complete ceasefire. (3) A mixed delegation composed of the KMT, the CCP, and neutral parties will be organized to inspect war zones. The content of the eight additional demands is as follows: (1) The Political Consultative Conference should convene on January 1st. (2) Immediate preparations should be made to convene this conference. (3) The Secretary-General of the Political Consultative Conference must be a non-government official. (4) Chen Jiageng, a wealthy Singaporean overseas Chinese, should participate in the Political Consultative Conference with a non-partisan status. (5) (Telegraph code unclear) (6) Complete freedom of the press. (7) Release of political prisoners (including Zhang Xueliang and Ye Ting). (8) (Broadcast interrupted, content unknown). It is reported that the Central Government does not object to the above demands.

[United Press, Chongqing, 28th] Propaganda Minister Wu Guozhen announced today that the government authorities have received the ceasefire proposal from the Communist Party and are currently considering a response. Wu stated that the Communist Party's sole reason for proposing a ceasefire is that they were defeated after attacking the Central Army and are now aware of the weakness of their military strength, "hence the sudden change in attitude." He also said, "The Communist Party previously believed they could defeat us, and this current change in attitude is the most gratifying sign of realizing reconciliation." Wu pointed out that the government proposed a ceasefire as early as October 31st. We regret that the Communist Party's proposal did not mention two important issues: the restoration of railway transportation and the repatriation of Japanese military and civilians. In the past four months, the Communist Army attacked GuiSui and Baotou in Suiyuan Province, Tengxian in Shandong Province, and Xiangyang in Hubei Province. The Communist Army was defeated everywhere and suffered heavy losses.

[United Press, Chongqing, 28th] President Chiang is today considering the Communist Party's written proposal for an unconditional ceasefire. It is expected that the government will formally respond when the KMT and CCP representatives meet tomorrow. However, according to a government spokesperson, any plan to freeze both sides in their current positions will prevent the execution of two major tasks: the restoration of transportation and the repatriation of Japanese troops and disbandment. The Communist Party's proposal is a response to the Central Government's proposal on November 30th, when the Central Government proposed a cessation of hostilities and the withdrawal of the Communist Army 18 miles from the railway lines, which the Communist Party opposed.

[United Press, Chongqing, 28th] Diplomatic circles revealed today that the KMT and CCP representatives began meeting here yesterday, and the atmosphere was "quite good". Special Envoy to China, Marshal Marshall, had a long discussion with Zhou Jingwen, a member of the Democratic League in Northeast China, regarding the Northeast issue.

### Three-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference Communiqué: Released in Moscow, Washington, and London, Global Situation Now More Clear

[Reuters, Moscow, 28th] Following the conclusion of the Three-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference, a 5,000-word communiqué was released simultaneously in London, Washington, and Moscow yesterday. The communiqué resolved to establish a United Nations commission to control atomic energy, reorganize the current system for controlling Japan, establish a Far Eastern Commission to replace the Far Eastern Advisory Commission, and establish a committee of the United States, China, Britain, and the Soviet Union to control Japan, among other matters. The communiqué also announced the detailed steps for the formal recognition of the Romanian and Bulgarian governments by Britain and the United States and resolved to make Korea an independent nation. The communiqué is divided into eight parts, the final part dealing with the control of atomic energy.

[United Press, Moscow, 28th] In the communiqué of the Three-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference, the foreign ministers of the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union suggested forming an atomic energy management committee to ensure that atomic energy is used for peaceful purposes. Byrnes, Bevin, and Molotov agreed on the conditions for the recognition of the governments of Romania and Bulgaria by Britain and the United States and prepared to conclude peace treaties with Italy, Romania, Bulgaria, and Finland. Regarding the United Nations General Assembly, the three foreign ministers suggested that the United Nations General Assembly convene in January to decide on the organization of the Atomic Energy Management Committee by the United Nations Security Council, and France and Canada have been invited to support this resolution.

[Reuters, Moscow, 28th] British Foreign Secretary Bevin will depart for home via Berlin after a farewell talk with Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov today. It is believed here that Marshal Stalin's presence in Moscow and the Soviet representatives' more conciliatory attitude were important factors. When Stalin received Bevin and Byrnes, he revealed extremely realistic, balanced, and hopeful views. British and American representatives said today that although much remains to be done, the conference was a very helpful starting point. The global situation is now clearly becoming clearer than before. Byrnes had previously suggested that the next Three-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference might be held in Washington next March. The discussion of atomic energy control was more important than other topics. The exchange of views on this matter among the three parties was exceptionally frank and friendly but did not involve technical details. Bevin and Byrnes had informed Canada in advance of the positions they adopted. Canada will be invited to participate in the agreement on the control of atomic energy. During the discussion of future weapons, the three foreign ministers and their advisors talked about cosmic-ray-guided bombs, radar-controlled bombs, and other new weapons. The British and American representatives believed that Soviet interests in Eastern Europe had been adequately recognized, and the American representatives further believed that the agreement on Eastern Europe had satisfied more than half of the Soviet Union's ambitions.

Committee Established: Joint Control of Atomic Energy

[Reuters, Moscow, 28th] Regarding the issue of atomic energy control, the communiqué of the Three-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference stated: The Soviet Union, the United States, and the United Kingdom agreed to invite China and France, members of the Security Council, as well as Canada, to jointly preside over the first meeting of the United Nations organization's General Assembly to propose the establishment of an Atomic Energy Control Commission. The Commission should rapidly investigate all stages of the atomic energy problem and should make recommendations as soon as possible. The Commission should especially make special recommendations on the following items: (1) Expanded exchange of peaceful scientific information by all countries; (2) Expanded control of atomic energy to ensure that it is only used for peaceful purposes; (3) National disarmament should eliminate atomic weapons and other weapons with group destructive capabilities; (4) Preventing accidental violations or evasions by member states through inspection and other methods. The Commission's work should be carried out in several stages. The next stage of work should not begin until the previous stage has been completed. The Commission should not infringe on the powers of any organization of the United Nations, but should submit recommendations to these organizations for consideration in accordance with the United Nations Charter. The Commission shall be composed of one representative from each member of the Security Council, together with one representative from Canada (if Canada has not been elected as a member of the Security Council). The Commission's reports and recommendations should be submitted to the Security Council and, where appropriate, also to the General Assembly and member states of the United Nations.

Britain and the United States: Approve Romania and Bulgaria Plan

[Reuters, Moscow, 28th] The communiqué of the Three-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference announced the plan for Britain and the United States to recognize the governments of Romania and Bulgaria. In the case of Romania, a committee composed of the Soviet Deputy People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs and the American and British ambassadors to the Soviet Union should go to Romania to inspect and determine whether the country's government has been expanded and whether free and unhindered elections can be held as soon as possible. A similar decision was made regarding Bulgaria. The communiqué also reiterated the communiqué on the peace treaty procedures for the German satellite states, which was released by Moscow Radio on December 24th. The communiqué stated that the Moscow Three-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference from December 16th to December 26th was held in accordance with the subsequent resolutions of the Crimea Conference and supplemented the Potsdam Conference with affirmation, because the prior resolutions stipulated that the participating countries should exchange views on a regular basis.

Iranian Issue: No Final Decision Made

[Reuters, Moscow, 28th] British Foreign Secretary Bevin stated: Although the communiqué of the Moscow Conference did not mention the Iranian issue, the issue was discussed in detail during the conference, but no final agreement was reached. This matter is currently being discussed through diplomatic channels. [United Press, Moscow, 27th] According to British Foreign Secretary Bevin and U.S. Secretary of State Byrnes, the Three-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference discussed the Iranian issue in detail, but no final agreement was reached.

### General Reaction After the Communiqué: Belief that the United States and Britain Have Made Concessions, Stalemate Broken, Differences Resolved

[Reuters, London, 28th] Regarding the communiqué released after the conclusion of the Moscow Foreign Ministers' Conference, the general reaction is that the stalemate caused by the failure of the London Foreign Ministers' Conference in September has now been broken, and there is a possibility that other differences have also been resolved. The New York Herald Tribune stated: This communiqué requires one to acknowledge the ability of the three foreign ministers to take responsibility and make decisions. The communiqué itself is a very promising sign. According to a telegram from our correspondent Hard Kesel, responsible individuals in Washington believe that the stalemate has been broken. However, U.S. Secretary of State Byrnes, who departed from Moscow yesterday on his way back to the United States, is expected to encounter fierce criticism from the right-wing opposition because he has "retreated" from the position he adopted at the London Foreign Ministers' Conference. American officials do not conceal their view that Byrnes has made "significant concessions," and British Foreign Secretary Bevin has also made smaller concessions.

### Balkan Stalemate: Completely Broken, Washington Expresses Gratification

[Reuters, Moscow, 28th] The Moscow Conference decided to start drafting European peace treaties and broke the Balkan stalemate. Washington is greatly relieved. It is heard that President Truman will fully support Byrnes in his broadcast speech on the "State of the Union," which somewhat confirms previous reports that Byrnes's trip to Moscow had unprecedented authority to negotiate an agreement with the Soviet Union and had a guarantee of the president's full support.

### France May Approve Peace Treaty Tomorrow

Italian Newspapers Express Dissatisfaction

[United Press, Rome, 28th] Italian newspapers today expressed dissatisfaction with the draft Italian peace treaty prepared by the Moscow Three-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference. All newspaper commentary stated: Italy fought alongside the Allied powers for the last eighteen months of the war, but the three foreign ministers did not take this into account.

### Opinions of American Congressmen

[United Press, Washington, 28th] American congressmen vigorously supported the Three-Power plan to manage atomic weapons, but sharply criticized the United States' agreement to grant the Soviet Union veto power in the expanded control of Japan policy. Senator Wiley expressed his fear, saying, "This subsequent resolution will weaken MacArthur's power and make his task more difficult. We do not understand why we must grant the Soviet Union veto power over MacArthur's power. Japan was defeated by us, and we have no reason to make concessions to anyone." Other congressmen expressed excitement about the ability of the Three-Power Conference to establish an agreement on issues such as controlling Japan and managing atomic bombs. House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Bloom said, "This is a step that should be taken, and the more we can cooperate and agree, the better the chances for world peace."

### British Cabinet to Hear Bevin's Report Next Week

### Situation in Vietnam: Has Become a Political Problem

[Reuters, Saigon, 28th] In the past few days, many rebels have surrendered, and not a few important strongholds of Annam nationalists have been recovered. Therefore, the situation in southern Vietnam has become a political problem rather than a military problem, because the French army's offensive has made progress, and French administrative officials are now taking over the districts.

Heavy Fighting North of Saigon

[United Press, Saigon, 28th] North of Saigon, French forces and Annam forces are engaged in heavy fighting. According to the French side, the Annam forces have recently been reinforced by irregular troops who have retreated from southern Cochinchina.

### Representatives of the Far Eastern Advisory Commission: En Route to Japan

[United Press, Hamilton Field, California, 27th] Forty representatives of the Far Eastern Advisory Commission, traveling on two transport planes from Washington to Japan, were forced to land here due to inclement weather. They are now flying to Fairfield and are scheduled to fly to Honolulu tonight and then to Japan.

[Central News Agency, New York, 26th Special Dispatch] It is learned that after the representatives of the Far Eastern Advisory Commission arrive in Japan, they will carefully study how MacArthur is implementing the instructions of the American authorities. Most representatives believe that MacArthur has done a good job in accordance with the instructions of the authorities. In the past two months, the commission has paid the most attention to studying the instructions themselves. Although most representatives unanimously agreed that the instructions of the American authorities were sound, they believed that some parts of the instructions should be further clarified, especially the original instructions issued by the White House to MacArthur shortly after Japan surrendered. Regarding this point, the Advisory Commission established a Basic Policy Subcommittee, chaired by Australian Foreign Minister Evatt, to be responsible for revising and clarifying the basic documents. The revised documents are currently being sent to the relevant governments for consideration. If approved and agreed upon by the United States, the new basic instructions will be sent to MacArthur for compliance.

The Turkish Prime Minister made this statement when submitting the budget, which was passed by 376 votes to 4.

[United Press, Istanbul, Turkey, 27th] According to reports from Trabzon: After the people of the Soviet Georgian Republic proposed that Turkey cede 200,000 square kilometers of land in nine provinces along the Black Sea and the eastern frontier to the Soviet Union, the local people held demonstrations today to express their opposition and declared that the Turkish people would rather die than submit. Turkey is waiting for the communiqué of the Moscow Three-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference on this issue, and the situation is becoming increasingly tense. According to the semi-official Anatolian News Agency: Turkey was deeply stimulated after the Georgians made a demand for the cession of territory, and almost all of the Turkish army was mobilized. Istanbul reimposed martial law for six months. The Turkish Prime Minister today requested that the state of martial law in the eastern border province of Tunceli be extended for one year.

### Indian Constitutional Committee Proposes Establishment of an Indian Federation, Opposes Division and Domination, Lawrence to Give Broadcast on New Year's Day

[United Press New Delhi, 27th] The Indian Constitutional Reform Committee today submitted its final report, advocating the establishment of an Indian Federation, including all of British India and the Indian states. It also stated that demands for division or non-accession were unacceptable, as they would leave the states and provinces outside the Federation. Division would betray the essence of the constitution and constitute an unconstitutional act. Therefore, the committee proposed removing the provision in the 1942 Cripps proposal that allowed states and provinces to choose not to join. The report concluded that Indian Muslims are not a separate nation isolated from other societies, and therefore the demands of the All-India Muslim League are not sufficient to resolve various common problems, but rather would create new ones. Considering only national defense, dividing a country into two independent states would endanger each other's security and make them more susceptible to foreign domination. Therefore, the committee firmly believes that a democratic constitution is most suitable for India, and that a representative government is also suitable, even in a joint legislative and executive body.

[Reuters London, 28th] Authoritative sources report: Lord Lawrence, the Secretary of State for India, will deliver a personal address to the people of India via radio broadcast at 4:15 PM on New Year's Day (12:15 AM Wednesday, Shanghai time).

### With Marshal Ma: A Joint Performance of the Ba Mountain Rain Song - A Quick Sketch of His First Press Conference After Arriving in Chongqing

Our national guest, Marshal Marshall, amidst the unanimous and enthusiastic anticipation of Chinese and foreign individuals, has traveled from Leesburg Village in Foosini, to Washington, to Shanghai, to Nanjing, and then, on the 22nd, flew to Chongqing. Details have been reported by our newspaper's special correspondent. Two days after Marshal Ma's arrival in Chongqing (the 24th), he held a press conference for Chinese and foreign journalists. No less than sixty reporters attended, chatting and laughing, creating an extremely harmonious and lively atmosphere throughout the venue. This poetic and lush report below is expected to be closely watched by readers. (Editor)

Marshal Marshall resides in the temporary official residence of Yi Yuan in Chongqing. Yi Yuan was originally the private residence of Dean Song. Many American dignitaries who have written their great achievements in the history of Sino-American friendship, such as Curie, Willkie, Willson, and Hurley, have successively resided there.

On the morning of the 24th, Marshal Marshall held his first press conference for Chinese and foreign journalists after arriving in Chongqing. The appointed time was 9:45 AM. Around 8:50 AM, reporters had already braved the cold rain and arrived at the American Embassy on Liangfu Zhi Road.

At 9:40 AM, Marshal Marshall arrived, still wearing the same clothes he had on when he got off the plane that day. He first walked with his entourage across the open space in front of the embassy office to overlook the Jialing River shrouded in misty rain. The reporters waited for him in the corridor. Three minutes later, he and his entourage came over, took off their coats outside the door, and greeted the reporters in English as they entered: "Good morning!" He walked through the aisle cleared by the reporters and into another room.

Following that, an embassy staff member invited the reporters to enter. It was a not-so-large room facing the sun, packed with more than sixty Chinese and foreign reporters.

Marshal Marshall leaned against the fireplace, the flames in the fireplace were blazing, and on the wall above the fireplace hung a large map of the Pacific Theater of War. The reporters saw even more clearly today this marshal who was decisive in the battles across the two oceans. His neatly combed hair was completely silver-white, but his complexion remained radiant and youthful. The three rows of medals on his chest and the white five-star marshal's shoulder boards all recorded his glorious achievements from World War I to the victory of World War II. On the little finger of the marshal's left hand, he wore a gold-set gemstone ring. The red flames, the large war map, the marshal's white hair, imposing presence, medals, and gemstone ring... all constituted an incomparably magnificent picture.

"Ladies and gentlemen!" Robinson, the Chargé d'Affaires of the American Embassy, spoke first. After a brief introduction to the reporters, he invited the Marshal to speak.

Two Strong Legs, Good at Kicking Demons

The fire in the fireplace was burning very brightly. Before Marshal Marshall was about to speak, a lump of red-hot burning coke rolled out of the fireplace. The Marshal kicked it back in with his leather shoe. Marshal Ma was a famous soccer player in his early years. Today, in this small room, the reporters saw his unconscious performance. At the same time, this is a ready-made metaphor: telling the world's fire players that Marshal Marshall's strong legs are always waiting to kick you into the furnace.

"Ladies and gentlemen!" Marshal Marshall said, "I am very happy to meet you here today! Thank you all for coming in such large numbers. It is a pity that this room is too small. Regarding the United States' policy toward China, President Truman has made a statement that you all already know. I don't want to say anything more about it today. I cannot answer any of your questions now, because I know very little about China and have only recently started learning about many things about China."

China and the United States Care About Each Other

He continued, "However, during this war, I am very clear about the United States' material, trade, and military assistance to China. I have been to the area of Beiping, Tianjin, Qinhuangdao, and Shanhaiguan in North China before. This is my first time in Shanghai, Nanjing, and Chongqing. I miss China very much, and the government and people of the United States also miss China. I believe that the government and people of China also miss the United States." Marshal Marshall spoke in a slow and sincere tone, "Now, I would like to hear what questions you have."

"How long will the Marshal stay in Chongqing?" a Chinese reporter asked.

"I don't know yet."

Whether to Go to Yan'an is Still Under Consideration

"Will you go to Yan'an?" the reporter asked.

"I have not considered this matter yet."

"When can the American troops stationed in China withdraw?"

"Don't know yet!"

After many unanswerable questions, this question made Marshal Marshall and the journalists burst into laughter together.

Marshal Marshall said, "I can answer this one. I am invited to lunch by Chairman Chiang and his wife at noon, and this afternoon I will attend a cocktail party at the American Embassy."

The questions ended there. Marshal Marshall greeted Chargé d'Affaires Robinson, who was standing next to the desk, and walked out of the reception room. The reporters followed him out.

Browsing Chinese Newspapers with Great Interest

Marshal Marshall stood at the door, shaking hands with the reporters one by one and asking each person which newspaper they represented. The reporters thanked him one by one. At this time, the reporter specially presented him with two copies of the newspaper, which the Marshal browsed and looked at with great interest.

In front of the embassy office building, Marshal Marshall and the reporters took a group photo, ending the press conference. From 12:15 PM on the 22nd to now, Marshal Marshall has been in Chongqing for a full two and a half days. His impression on the Chinese and American people in Chongqing is extremely profound.

More Revelry on Top of Revelry

As the reporter writes this dispatch, it is the first Christmas after the victory. Outside the window, the poetic "Ba Mountain Night Rain" is falling. Let us let this guest from across the Pacific Ocean personally taste this lush poetry! This year's Christmas Eve in Chongqing, in the common memory of the Chinese and American people, is a layer of revelry added on top of revelry.

(Christmas Eve, 12:00 AM, Zhao Haosheng, sent from Chongqing.)

### Statistics on Losses in Soviet Agriculture

The figures of the losses inflicted by the German occupiers on Soviet agriculture are truly appalling. According to written evidence, the Special Committee for Investigating the Atrocities of the National German Fascist Aggressors estimates that the losses of collective farms alone amounted to 181,000,000,000 rubles. In addition, the losses of machinery and tractor stations amounted to tens of billions of rubles.

The German fascist aggressors destroyed the collective and state-owned farms, machinery, and tractor stations in the Soviet territories they occupied, according to a pre-determined plan. The German army destroyed, seized, or transported back to the country from Soviet collective farms and state-owned farm machinery and tractor stations 137,000 tractors, 40,000 combine harvesters, approximately 4 million cultivating tools, 265,000 seeders, and 885,000 harvesting machines.

The German army destroyed almost all of the agronomic laboratories of the collective farms. The aggressors also inflicted huge losses on livestock breeding. They killed or transported back to their country 7 million horses, 17 million cattle, and tens of millions of sheep. (Translated by US News)

Editorial

### The Achievements of the Three-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference

The Three-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference concluded in the Soviet capital on the 27th, lasting twelve days since its opening on the 15th of this month. The conference was convened because all parties, in light of the failure of the Five-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference in October, the Soviet Union's refusal to participate in the Far Eastern Advisory Commission, and the difficulties regarding the control of atomic energy, although holding fervent hopes, initially did not dare to have overly optimistic expectations. However, over these twelve days, the Moscow Three-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference proceeded in an atmosphere of harmony and coordination, and ultimately reached several important agreements, which is truly a comforting thing.

According to the communique of the Three-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference, which was released simultaneously in Moscow, Washington, and London on the 28th, the conference reached the following important agreements: (1) Establishing the Far Eastern Commission to replace the existing Far Eastern Advisory Commission, and establishing a four-nation committee of China, the Soviet Union, Britain, and the United States to control Japan; (2) The US and Soviet troops should withdraw from China within the shortest possible time after completing their missions in China; (3) Supporting the Chongqing National Government to implement democratic politics; (4) Establishing an Atomic Energy Management Committee to ensure its application to peaceful goals; (5) Regarding the Korean situation, the US and Soviet military headquarters will conduct consultations within two weeks to organize a joint committee to assist in the establishment of a Korean provisional government; (6) Britain and the United States recognize the conditions of Romania and Bulgaria, etc. In addition to these, some issues may have been raised for discussion, but their absence from the announced results does not mean that there are other secret agreements; it seems to only have been an exchange of views without reaching any agreement. However, even in terms of the announced results, the richness of the gains of this Three-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference has truly exceeded general expectations. This is another clear demonstration of the three powers' wholehearted cooperation in handling the world situation; we sincerely hope that this spirit of harmonious and coordinated cooperation can continue to be promoted and developed.

However, after reading the announcement of the Three-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference, we cannot help but feel many emotions. The Three-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference has agreements regarding China, but our country has no representative to participate in it. We do not deny that the Three-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference's agreements on China are quite wise; what we regret is that China's international status has improved after a long war of resistance, but there are still people in the country who do not value national interests and engage in internal struggles, so that the situation in China is also included in the agenda of the Three-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference. Anyone with sincerity should feel ashamed of this. Now that the three powers have insight into the situation in our country and have unanimously agreed to support the National Government in implementing democratic politics, conspirators who plot to undermine China's unity and those ambitious people who attempt to overthrow the National Government should restrain themselves.

Regarding the issue of joint control of Japan, we have pointed out that this issue is not a disagreement in principle, but a difficulty in execution. The defeat of the Japanese invaders was due in no small part to the strength of the American military, but China, the Soviet Union, and the United States have all made contributions. Among them, China has resisted Japanese aggression for the longest time and made the greatest sacrifices. In principle, we strongly agree with the joint control of Japan, but the so-called joint control may have various different interpretations. MacArthur in Tokyo is acting as the Supreme Commander of the Allied Forces, not as the Supreme Commander of the US Forces, in performing his duties, so MacArthur himself already represents joint control. The joint control of Germany is divided into zones of governance by Britain, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union. Although there is a joint control committee, in practice, it is practically a hollow shell. This is an example of the Allied powers' joint control of defeated Germany. It is said that the Soviet military has requested to send troops to occupy Hokkaido, but MacArthur only agreed to send troops to Kyushu. Whether the so-called joint control of Japan will follow the precedent of joint control of defeated Germany is also an issue of implementation. Furthermore, China, the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union may each send troops to Japan, without dividing the occupation zones of each country, and jointly control the entire Japan as the object. All of these are different interpretations that the joint control of Japan may cause. We believe that since MacArthur has entered Japan in the name of the Supreme Commander of the Allied Forces, the major Allied powers that fought against Japan should strengthen MacArthur's power with this as the center, and should not repeat the mistakes of joint control of Germany and implement a policy of zonal occupation. The Three-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference's agreement on the joint control of Japan can be said to be a good step forward in this direction.

Regarding the independence of Korea, the Cairo Conference already had a clear announcement. Now that the war has been won, the promises of the Cairo Conference should naturally be put into practice. The recent situation in Korea seems quite disappointing. The existence of the US and Soviet military occupation zones has left Korea in a split. The 38th parallel is a very painful wound for the Korean people. This unnatural division, although perhaps an inevitable result in military terms, is a hidden concern for the survival of the Korean nation. The Three-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference's agreement on Korea, while taking care of the facts, does not forget the spirit proclaimed by the Cairo Conference, which is a great achievement. The only urgent task of the joint committee at present is how to connect the US and Soviet military occupation zones, so that this artificial barrier can be eliminated; then Korea can embark on the road to democracy and independence.

Regarding the issue of atomic energy, it is also very gratifying that this Three-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference was able to reach an agreement. In the past, the three powers seemed to have quite different views on the issue of atomic energy. In fact, the core of the issue is not in keeping or disclosing the secret of the use of atomic energy, but in how to control the use of atomic energy. From a long-term perspective, it is impossible to keep the secret of the use of atomic energy; therefore, asking for the disclosure of the secret of the use of atomic energy seems to be meddling. The problem is control. Now that the British-Soviet Conference has agreed to organize an international committee to deal with issues regarding the use of atomic energy, it is believed that effective control will be obtained.

The Three-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference has been changed into a "Three-Power Dictatorship Conference." Although this is close to slander, from a realistic point of view, the convening of the Three-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference can exchange opinions with each other and reach agreements on some major issues, which is of great benefit to the stability of the international situation. It is regrettable that when the interests of China and France were involved, although the two countries maintained close contact with Moscow, they ultimately failed to actively participate in expressing their views. The reconstruction of the world order requires the concerted efforts of the United Nations. This Three-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference has established a good standard for international cooperation, and may that spirit be maintained for a long time. The world's future and the happiness of mankind depend on it.

As a result, compared to the previous close, Wing On Textile rose by 35 yuan, Mei Ya by 25 yuan, New Kwong by 2.5 yuan, and Kwan Hing and King Fook by 2 yuan each. Various parties are gradually searching for unpopular stocks in the stock market, taking advantage of their cheap value.

Foreign stocks, stimulated by Chinese stocks and boosted by the US dollar, flourished again. As a result, Ewo Textiles rose by another 120 yuan, Ewo Brewery by 40 yuan, Paper Industry by 40 yuan, and various unpopular stocks also generally rose by half a percent to one percent. Rubber stocks had only a few transactions and were relatively sluggish.

### Price Controls on US Cotton Fabrics Will Not Be Abolished for the Time Being

(Reuters, New York, 28th) It is reported that there is no hope of abolishing price controls on cotton fabrics before June 1946.

It is estimated that it will take about half a month for factories to clear their 1945 orders one by one.

### Yarn Sales Remain Healthy

Yesterday, the yarn market remained stable. Scattered households from Hong Kong and Guangdong continued to absorb 20-count special Double Horse yarn, rising by another 20,000. Sales from other merchant groups were sluggish. However, local cloth factories continued to have a healthy appetite for fine yarn. Each brand of 32-count and above rose by another 50,000 to 60,000 yuan. The price of 20-count and 16-count yarn rose by about 10,000 yuan. Transactions were not very active, but the trend was still considered strong.

### Japonica and Indica Rice See Further Declines

Soybeans, Raw Peanuts, and Soybean Oil All Rise

The source of rice from the southern gangs continued to surge, and the digestion in the city remained weak. Japonica and indica rice saw further declines of 200 to 300 yuan. However, Yang indica rice was scarce and remained strong. Bai Yuan rice was plentiful and continued to fall by a small amount of 300 to 400 yuan. Yin Yuan rice arrivals were quite strong, with supply exceeding demand, falling sharply by 600 to 700 yuan. There were few buyers. At the close, the early Bo rice from Qingdao gangs was slightly taken up, and there were not many transactions. The export of flour weakened, and the appetite in the city was still sluggish due to the continued distribution of the second phase of price-controlled flour. The price fell by several tens to 100 yuan compared to yesterday. Soybean retail sales were very active, and the price rose by 200 to 300 yuan. The oil market was inquired about by the Ningbo gang, and sales were still active, with the price rising by 1,000 yuan. Soybean cake sales were thin downstream, and the price fell by 100 to 200 yuan.

After following the procedures, a request was made to the Financial Commissioner to approve it. A reply has been received stating that the debts of enemy banks have been stipulated not to be cleared in any case, and the dismissal fee required by the factory should be paid with other funds.

### The Sugar Market Has Positive Outlook

The sugar market has a positive outlook because the Wuhu gang is absorbing a large amount, in fact because the New Year is approaching, and the rural attire has already moved, causing the merchants to have a positive outlook, and they are reluctant to sell, especially the white refined sugar, and the Yiwu Green is also the same.

### North-South Goods Sales Are Moving, Overseas Market is Strong

Bamboo shoots arrivals remain scarce, and the goods are also inferior. The sales are also mainly in the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo lines, and they are coming to Shanghai to purchase them, and the market has repeatedly seen sharp increases. Melon seeds, red dates, and black dates are all showing their beauty with them. The Xianghou mushrooms are also being handled by the Hong Kong gang. Seafood merchants see an opportunity to take advantage of, and they generally hold on to them and wait for a good price.

### The Market Price of Coal Briquettes Continues to Rise, Firewood and Charcoal Are Also Gradually Seeing a Turnaround

White coal briquettes continue to sell well. The inventory of the same industry is thin. The goods owners see an opportunity to adjust the price, and the market price continues to rise. The prices of bituminous coal are stable and constant, and the prices lack glory and disgrace. The number of boats arriving from overseas with firewood and charcoal has suddenly decreased due to the weather and wind direction, etc., and only a few river boats are still transporting them to Shanghai, so the market is gradually seeing a turnaround, and the market is gradually becoming firm.

### Building Materials Sell Well, Shipments Are Many - Market is Stable

Building materials such as cement, asphalt, roofing felt, and asphalt paper are selling very well, because there are government agencies purchasing them, and various factory owners who are repairing their factories are also purchasing them.

In the tea market, there is a lot of supply and the market is weak for coarse Chen green tea, but those with high quality are priced steadily, and transactions are still not lonely.

Among knitted goods, 32-count socks continue to rise, because the Wuhu, Nanjing, Chongqing, and other merchant groups are consistently purchasing.

Due to the gold price exceeding 80,000 yuan, there is a lack of buyers for cigarettes, and the market is showing beauty. Old knives are selling for more than 6,000 yuan, but the supply of British cigarettes is high and the price is falling.

### Hong Kong British Merchants Resume Business: Accept Three-Month Orders; Prefer British Exchange Over US Exchange

[Hong Kong Dispatch] Hong Kong's business is indeed thriving. Various foreign firms are preparing to resume operations, and some have already begun accepting orders for goods with a three-month delivery period, indicating that goods will arrive in three months. The orders mainly consist of building materials, timber, copper, iron, textiles, automobiles, and daily necessities. Although merchants generally tend towards business, British exchange is preferred over US exchange for purchasing foreign exchange, resulting in British merchants receiving more orders. This is because the Hong Kong government, in order to support British merchants, allows direct application to banks for British pound exchange with proof of importing goods from the sterling area, while applications for US dollar exchange must first be submitted to the authorities for approval, which is somewhat restrictive. However, competition from American merchants is very active, and it is reported that the US government will send a commercial specialist to Hong Kong to plan everything. The four major companies in Hong Kong have sent representative Huang Yongshan to Australia to purchase goods on behalf of the four companies.

Sir Stafford Cripps, President of the Board of Trade, stated in the House of Commons on October 15th that a tripartite joint organization had been established for cotton and other industries, consisting of representatives of employers, workers, and impartial individuals, so that British industry could compete in the world market and supply domestic consumption with affordable and high-quality goods. At a press conference on the same day, Cripps also stated that the government had firmly decided not to nationalize industries that established such organizations, but that the organizations could make any recommendations other than nationalization.

May be presented to the Central Propaganda Department for legal action

[Dahua News Agency, Chongqing Air Dispatch] The Executive Yuan previously formulated temporary measures for managing newspapers, news agencies, magazines, film, and broadcasting undertakings in recovered areas, ordering various provinces and cities to comply.

### Expert in Geography and Cartography, Su Jiabing, Passes Away

[Central News Agency, Local Dispatch] Su Jiabing, an expert in geography and cartography, passed away in Shanghai the day before yesterday (the 27th). Mr. Su graduated from National Peking University. He created the "Historical Map of Chinese Geography" and researched geography and cartography. His prolific works include the creation of the "Industrial Plan Map of Dr. Sun Yat-sen" and the production of the "Greatest Complete Map of the Northeast and the Map of China and Japan," making great contributions to China's cultural circles. When the August 13th Incident occurred, he was unable to move inland and lived in seclusion in Shanghai. Although he was under the oppression of the enemy, he still worked day and night, providing the people of China with maps of the Northeast provinces that did not change color. Last summer, he was arrested by the Japanese gendarmerie and imprisoned for nearly a month. He was subjected to torture and enticement, but he remained unyielding. After Mr. Su was released from prison, the internal damage was already deep. He was sent to the Red Cross Hospital by his family for treatment, where he was hospitalized for half a year. Recently, with the victory achieved, Mr. Su was mentally excited and seemed to be recovering. However, due to excessive internal injuries, he passed away on the 27th of this month.

The discussion was heated, and finally three improvement measures were proposed: (1) The school's finances should be made public and expenditures should be rationalized, (2) The school board should be responsible for supplementing funds, and (3) Salaries should be the same as those of municipal school teachers. For temporary relief, it was requested that the Director of Education initiate a Respect Teachers Movement. It is reported that the Association has already submitted a request to the Education Bureau for implementation.

Ying Yongyu, Huo Mingjie, Tang Zhidi, Zhou Songkang, and others, graduates of the Department of Commerce of Shanghai Law School, will hold a joint banquet on New Year's Day of the 35th year of the Republic to celebrate the school's relocation from Tunxi to Shanghai and to welcome Acting President Chu Hanlai for his hard work for the country and the school.

### Chengyou Cup Group A Yesterday: Shan Team Defeats Donghua by a Large Margin

Green Forest Suffers a Crushing Defeat

Desheng Triumphs

Yesterday, the weather suddenly turned cold, and the basketball court was not very crowded, perhaps due to the sudden price increase by the authorities. In the two matches, the first match between Desheng and Green Forest was relatively close. The second match between the Shan team and Donghua went by in a one-sided situation. As a result, Green Forest suffered a crushing defeat to Desheng with a score of 22 to 26. In the second match between the Shan team and Donghua, the score was 48 to 31, with the Shan team defeating Donghua by a large margin.

### Central Agricultural Experiment Station

— Chen Jiaer

The Qingbei Highway is a branch of the Chengdu-Chongqing Highway. Going north from Qingmuguan along the Qingbei Highway, four kilometers from Beibei, there is a small market called Tianshengqiao, which is also a station on the Qingbei Highway. If you jump off the bus here, what unfolds before your eyes is a vast and beautiful farm—the Central Agricultural Experiment Station.

In May of last year, former US Vice President Wallace visited Beibei. Instead of visiting the famous scenic Beibei Hot Springs, he made a special trip to visit this place. He praised it greatly and promised to do his best to assist after returning to the United States to facilitate connections and promote development.

The Central Agricultural Experiment Station is not just a simple farm, but also an academic research institution. It is located at the foot of Jinyun Mountain and experiments with the planting of rice, wheat, beans, cotton, melons, fruits, and vegetables. It conducts research on soil, fertilizers, diseases, and variety improvement, and has achieved great results. In recent years, it has not only made many inventions in agricultural affairs, but also, because of the good harvests, influenced the farmers in the nearby area to automatically improve their agriculture. This is most commendable. The tomatoes they harvest are as big as ordinary vegetable bowls, with a lovely red color. They are also experimenting with improving a type of mandarin orange produced near Beibei, striving to make its color, fragrance, and taste comparable to the Sunkist produced in the United States.

The staff work both mentally and physically, using both their brains and their hands. Sometimes they observe pests under a microscope, and sometimes they cultivate bacteria in a greenhouse. They use pens to depict the morphology of pests and bacteria, recording their changes. They also draw curves on forms, recording everything they have researched. Sometimes they also work in the fields with hoes and plows, improving agricultural tools for application and increasing work efficiency.

This is truly a new world. If more of these academicized farms were established in the country, agriculture would definitely make great progress, and there would be no need to worry about heavy industry lacking a foundation in the nation-building stage.

### Municipal Government Meeting Discusses: Construction of Public Housing; Widening of West Nanjing Road; Establishment of Shanghai Relief Home

The Shanghai Municipal Government held its 14th Municipal Government Meeting at 9:30 AM on the 28th. Mayor Qian Dajun, Deputy Mayor He Dekui, Secretary-General Shen Shihua, and bureau chiefs, directors, and advisors attended. Mayor Qian chaired the meeting. The following matters were discussed:

Key Resolutions

(1) The draft organizational regulations of the Shanghai Relief Home, jointly prepared by the Social Affairs Bureau and the Police Bureau, was discussed. Approved according to the review opinions. (2) The draft organizational regulations of the Shanghai Health Bureau's Health Experiment Institute, the Shanghai Health Bureau's Drug and Food Inspection Institute, and the Shanghai Drug Supply Office, submitted by the Health Bureau, were discussed. Approved with amendments. (3) The Public Works Bureau's proposal to construct public housing to alleviate the housing problem for some of the poor was discussed. Approved in principle, and: 1. Request the Chairman to instruct the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration to allocate materials; 2. Request the Executive Yuan to instruct the Shanghai Enemy and Puppet Property Management Bureau to allocate funds from the proceeds of selling enemy and puppet properties; 3. Repair funds will be allocated immediately by the Municipal Government; 4. The Public Works Bureau will begin work on this project. (4) The Civil Affairs Department's draft organizational rules for the Shanghai urban area's Baojia Reorganization Committee and the Shanghai urban area's temporary Baojia organizational measures were discussed. Approved with amendments. (5) The Public Works Bureau proposed: The temporary measures for restricting the issuance of construction permits have expired, but the city's overall urban plan is difficult to complete in the short term, and the road systems of each district cannot be stipulated and announced in time. Should the restrictions be extended? Approved. (6) The Public Works Bureau proposed: To widen the section of West Nanjing Road along the north side of the racecourse first to facilitate traffic. Approved.

Public Housing

During the city's occupation, the number of houses destroyed was countless, leading to ordinary people erecting simple shacks on vacant land for shelter. However, the materials used were mostly bamboo, wood, reed mats, etc., and they were built privately, making them very prone to fire and endangering lives. Hygiene was also often neglected. Therefore, temporary measures for banning private shack construction and temporary measures for shack construction were enacted to gradually ban them. In particular, those built on sewers, obstructing dredging work, were even more urgent. However, if they are demolished without appropriate relief measures, it would inevitably lead to displacement and neglect of the basic needs of the people. Therefore, yesterday's municipal government meeting decided on a public housing construction plan within the city, which will be carried out in three steps: (1) Add public housing villages, 1,000 units of Grade A and 2,000 units of Grade B, for a total of 3,000 units, with each unit limited to one household. (2) Restore the destroyed public housing villages on Qimei Road, Zhongshan Road, Pushan Road, and Xietu Road, rebuilding on the original sites, with 194 units of Grade A and 316 units of Grade B. In addition, existing public housing villages in the above locations will be repaired.

Relief Facilities

The main points of the organization of the Municipal Relief Home are as follows: The organizational rules of the Relief Home stipulate that the internal structure includes a director and a deputy director, who will be appointed by the Municipal Government upon recommendation by the Social Affairs Bureau. There will be three groups under them: general affairs, fundraising, and accounting. The most important relief facilities will include: (1) Home for the Elderly, (2) Infant Home, (3) Orphanage, (4) Home for the Disabled, (5) Vocational Training Center, (6) Women's Training Center, (7) Maternity Clinic, (8) Almshouse, (9) Other.

### Over 700,000 Japanese Nationals and Prisoners of War to be Concentrated in Shanghai

The Shanghai Port Transportation Headquarters, established to handle the repatriation of Japanese nationals and prisoners of war from various parts of Central China, was officially established a few days ago. Regarding the general situation of the repatriation of Japanese nationals and prisoners of war, Major General Xie Hao, who also serves as the commander, told the Central News Agency reporter yesterday that the total number of Japanese nationals and prisoners of war currently scattered throughout Central China is 733,134. They will soon be transported to Shanghai in batches to await ships for repatriation. So far, there have been three batches repatriated, carrying a total of 11,150 Japanese nationals and prisoners of war back east. Additionally, six U.S. landing ships were originally scheduled to arrive in Shanghai yesterday to take the fourth batch of 6,000 Japanese prisoners of war back to Japan. However, the ships did not arrive yesterday but are expected to arrive today. Starting from January next year, there will be over sixty ships of various sizes each month dedicated to transporting Japanese nationals and prisoners of war back to their country. Because both the Chinese and American authorities are eager to repatriate these Japanese individuals as soon as possible, the U.S. Shanghai Port Command and the U.S. Headquarters of the China Theater are working closely with our Shanghai Port Transportation Headquarters to carry out the operation. Regarding the investigation of Japanese war criminals, Xie stated that the list of Japanese individuals to be repatriated will first be submitted to the War Crimes Investigation Department for review. Those who are approved to return to Japan will then be concentrated in designated locations. The former site of the Shanghai Municipal Government is currently being used as the concentration site. Their luggage, personal belongings, and bodies will be jointly inspected by customs officers, police, and military police. After the inspection, trucks will transport the luggage, women, and children to the Qujiang Wharf to board the ships, while the men will walk to the wharf.

### Newsreel of Chairman's Visit to Beiping to be Screened Starting Today

The "Special Newsreel of Chairman Chiang's Visit to Beiping," recently filmed by the Central Film Studio, chronicles Chairman Chiang's meetings with elders in Beiping, visits to the Palace Museum and museums, a speech to students in the Taihe Hall, and the grand welcome of Chairman's visit to Beiping by the citizens. It premiered yesterday with very satisfactory results.

### No Country May Exercise Arrest Powers within Our Borders – Statement by Chen Guolian of the Foreign Ministry Office

[Report from Our Newspaper] Regarding recent reports of the French Consul General in Shanghai arresting over a dozen French Nazi members in Shanghai, this reporter specifically visited Chen Guolian, Director of the Foreign Ministry Office in Shanghai. Mr. Chen stated: The consular jurisdiction of various countries in China was announced as abolished long ago, and relevant countries have successively signed new treaties with our country.

For countries that have not signed new treaties with us or a couple that have not yet announced the cancellation of consular jurisdiction in China, whether their consular jurisdiction in China still exists remains technically questionable. However, this is only a question. In principle, these countries have long been considered to no longer enjoy this special treatment. Therefore, by-products attached to consular jurisdiction that existed unilaterally, such as the former Japanese consular police, are certainly not allowed to be retained, and are absolutely not allowed to operate within our country. As for the agreement that the Allied countries signed to address the jurisdictional management of troops stationed in each other's countries, which was based on wartime needs and to facilitate overseas troop management when they fought alongside our country years ago, where our country signed such with Britain and America. However, this was purely based on wartime needs and was of an absolute

reciprocal nature.

For example, our troops stationed in India, Burma, and other British or American territories or jurisdictions enjoy such treatment. France does not have a similar agreement with our country, and its consular jurisdiction in China is also considered to have been abolished. If, as reported, there is indeed the fact of exercising arrest powers within our country, it is a violation of rights and illegal, and should bear legal responsibility. However, Mr. Chen himself has only seen this in the news. The details of the situation are being thoroughly investigated in conjunction with relevant authorities. Once it is verified to be true, the government will handle it according to the law.

In addition, this office will officially start operating at the former Japanese Consulate on Huangpu Road next New Year's Day. The personnel of the office are currently en route to Shanghai from Chongqing. Currently, the work focuses on the reception and handling of enemy and puppet diplomatic administrative agencies and their properties. Once the office location is established and the personnel are sufficient, matters such as visa applications and passport issuance will be handled.

### Construction of Martyrs' Shrine to Commemorate Fallen Soldiers

The Third War Area Command, in order to commemorate the fallen soldiers, has specially established a Martyrs' Shrine on the original site of the former Shanghai Shrine on Jiangwan Road as a memorial. Wang Guanghan, Hu Jingru, Gou Jitang, Zhang _, and Zou Renzhi have been appointed to be responsible for the preparations.

### Shanghai Branch of the Foreign Relations Association Holds Meeting of Directors and Supervisors

The Shanghai Branch of the Chinese National Foreign Relations Association held its first joint meeting of directors and supervisors of the first session yesterday afternoon at 3 p.m. at the Eight Immortals Bridge YMCA. Over forty directors and supervisors attended, including Yan Huifeng and Li Jilan. Yan Huiqing served as the chairman. On the spot, it was resolved to invite Soong Ching-ling, Qian Dajun, Tang Enbo, Wu Shaoshu, Gu Zhutong, Kong Xiangxi, Li Deng_ _, Liu Hongsheng, Qian Xinzhi, and Li Zhaoshi as honorary directors. The meeting passed the proposals submitted by the general assembly and the work plans, and resolved to organize an Allied Nations inspection group. Finally, the standing directors were elected. It is learned that Yan Huiqing, Du Yuesheng, Pan Gongzhan, Xi Yushu, Wang _xiao, Gu Yuxiu, Rong Hongyuan, Qian Jianqiu, and Zhong Ketuo were elected as the first session of standing directors of the association. Furthermore, the association has decided to hold the first meeting of the first session of standing directors at noon on the 31st, still at the YMCA.

### French Consul General Philip Offers Cocktail Reception

The French Consul General in Shanghai, Philip, held a cocktail party at his private residence yesterday evening at 5:30 p.m. Those in attendance included our side's Deputy Mayor, Commander Li, Generals Lan and Tengshang Zhenbing, Councilor Zhang Yishu, Feng Youzhen of the Central Propaganda Department, Special Commissioner of the Foreign Ministry Chen Guolian, and many other dignitaries. From the American side were General Wedemeyer, General Stratemeyer, General Barbee, the British Consul, and the Director of the Press Office, among others. In addition, there were over thirty French dignitaries and military personnel in Shanghai, as well as over a hundred guests. They laughed, talked, and drank, creating a splendid scene for a time.

### General Wedemeyer to Receive Reporters Today

General Wedemeyer is scheduled to receive Chinese and foreign reporters from the city at 11:00 a.m. today (the 29th) in the conference room on the eighth floor of the Construction Building. All participating reporters must bring the reporter pass issued by the former U.S. Headquarters.

### Shipping Date Postponed Due to Unclear Sea Obstacles

[Report from Our Newspaper] The Taikoo Company's Beihai vessel, managed by the British Far East Shipping Management Office, was scheduled to arrive in Shanghai on the 27th after its first post-war voyage from Hong Kong via Shantou. The arrival was later changed to yesterday. According to the manager's announcement yesterday, the ship was expected to arrive at 8:00 a.m. this morning. However, due to the incomplete clearance of obstacles at sea, the journey was slower, and the arrival date could not be determined. The vessel's departure from Shanghai to Hong Kong, originally scheduled for the 30th, was also postponed to the end of the month due to the delay, with export to Hong Kong scheduled for New Year's Day. The English ship Bromisthesis, from the American port of Philidelphia, carrying 6,700 packages of relief wheat to China managed by the same office was expected to arrive in Shanghai on the 27th. However, as of dusk, there was no news of its arrival. Suddenly, the manager announced: the vessel was diverted to arrive today; yesterday, according to reliable information from the shipping industry, the vessel encountered difficulties approximately 90 nautical miles from Wusongkou, near Sheshan Ocean, while sailing two days prior. The details are unknown, and it is feared that the vessel will not be able to enter the port today.

Coal Shortage in Shanghai, Continuously Transported to Hankou

Due to the coal shortage in Shanghai, coal has been continuously transported to provide assistance. Currently, 2,000 tons need to be transported to Hankou. The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company has dispatched three ships, the Jiangning, Tongmeng, and Jiang'an, for transportation. The Jiangning ship, loaded with 800 tons, is scheduled to sail to Hankou today. The Tongmeng ship is also loaded with 800 tons and will sail upstream tomorrow. The Jiang'an ship arrived in Shanghai today and is scheduled to sail to Hankou next Monday, also carrying 400 tons. Approximately 70,000 to 80,000 tons of coal are shipped from Qinhuangdao to Shanghai each month.

Lightship Aground Near Huangzhou

The lightship near Huangzhou on the Yangtze River waterway is aground, and the water level in Hankou has receded. According to a telegram from Hankou received by the shipping industry, the Customs Yangtze River Navigation Affairs Office issued a temporary navigation notice stating that the lightship is currently aground on the sand. From the Huangzhou Pagoda, the bearing of the lightship aground is 306 degrees, 2.82 nautical miles. It is currently used as a shore navigation marker, with a class 6 translucent light. Upstream vessels should keep a distance of three cables from the left bank. After passing the lower Huangzhou dock, the port side of the vessel should be three cables apart from the starboard side of the lightship. Vessels should navigate between ships during daylight hours until further notice regarding the lightship. The water level at the location was 17 feet on the 23rd of this month, and the water level in Hankou was 9 feet 7 inches. Please inform all upstream vessels, etc. All shipping agencies have been notified to advise captains to pay attention after receiving the information. It is also learned that the waterways of Beiyang Tianjin, Baihe, Qinhuangdao, and other rivers freeze every winter, and navigation is suspended. Import and export vessels can only moor outside the port. However, this year is exceptional, and navigation is still possible without freezing.

Fare Regulations for Nanyang Routes

Passenger and Cargo Registration for Minyu Vessel Handled

The Minsheng Company's Minyu vessel has been missing for a week since the accident on the night of the 22nd. All cargo carried by the ship was salvaged on the 26th, and attorney Wei Wenda has been entrusted to handle compensation matters for passengers and cargo owners' losses. Regarding the salvage of the Minyu vessel, the company has dispatched six divers who are working underwater all day. So far, one-third of the ship's hull has emerged from the water, and it is expected to be completely salvaged in about a week. The total loss is estimated to be over ten million yuan.

### First Batch of Price-Controlled Oil to be Sold Next Week - Each Person Can Purchase Five Jin

The first price-controlled sale of cooking oil in the city is scheduled to begin on January 5th next year.

However, there will be no restrictions on the quantity of price-controlled oil distributed, and the actual sales volume of each retailer will be used as the standard.

Scalpers Discovered During the Fifth Phase of Price-Controlled Cloth Sales

During the fifth phase of price-controlled cloth sales, the five major companies on Nanjing Road have been selling for the past three days, and the crowd of purchasers has been very large. The situation is different from the fourth phase of sales for two reasons: one is that the prices set in the previous phase were too high, and the bleached cloth received by the companies has not yet been sold out. They are currently seeking instructions from the Enemy and Puppet Property Management Bureau on how to handle it. The other is that the foreign exchange gold price was falling at that time, and purchasers were taking a wait-and-see attitude. However, the companies have discovered scalpers buying up the cloth. Yesterday morning, the Tashing Company's iron gate at the price-controlled sales area was damaged due to the scalpers, and two people were injured. One was a child named Miao Fa, an apprentice at the Meishin Shirt Factory, who suffered a fractured forehead and teeth. The other was a woman whose foot bone was crushed. Both were sent to Renji Hospital for treatment. The cloth being bought up by the scalpers is the Laba Jian brand fine cloth. Each person can purchase ten zhang for 8,000 yuan each time. As soon as they leave the company's door, someone buys it for 11,000 yuan. It is hoped that the authorities will strictly enforce the law and crack down on this.

### Chairman of the Textile Enterprise Council, Dong Yanzhang, Arrives in Shanghai Yesterday

### Jeep Crashes into Police Booth

(Report from This Newspaper) At approximately 10:10 PM on the 26th, at the public bus ticketing booth at the old west gate in the southern district, a large jeep belonging to the American military drove by at high speed and crashed into the booth. The police officer Liu Dafu, who was standing next to the booth, sustained a severe injury to his left ankle. The vehicle was sent to a police hospital for treatment.

### Director of the Taiwan Agricultural and Forestry Department Arrives in Shanghai to Discuss Fertilizer Shortage

Yesterday afternoon, the reporter visited Zhao Lianfang, Director of the Taiwan Provincial Department of Agriculture and Forestry, who had just flown to Shanghai from Taiwan. When asked about the agricultural and forestry situation in Taiwan, he answered as follows: (1) The rice production in Taiwan this year is approximately 4.9 million taishi (approximately 1.8 shishi). Before the war, the production was over 9.5 million taishi. The reason for the decrease in production is the lack of fertilizer, insufficient rainfall, and the reduction in the number of farmers due to enlistment. The total food consumption in Taiwan is approximately 6.4 million taishi, so Taiwan's rice supply is still insufficient. (2) There are approximately 3 million farmers in Taiwan. Their working methods are similar to those in the Jiangsu and Zhejiang areas, but they are accustomed to using chemical fertilizers. (3) The quality of the rice produced is very good, similar to the japonica rice produced in Jiangnan. (4) The chemical fertilizer required for all the farmland in Taiwan is several hundred thousand tons, which was previously imported from Japan, but the source has now been cut off. (5) In order to expand rice production, the area of sugarcane land has been reduced as much as possible. (6) The main task of this trip is to discuss and resolve Taiwan's fertilizer problem, and he is scheduled to return to Taiwan in early next week.

### The 35th New Year's Day is Approaching Soon - All Sectors are Preparing for Grand Celebrations

[Report from Our Newspaper] The first New Year's Day after the victory is coming in three days. All sectors of the city are currently preparing for grand celebrations to express their enthusiasm for the nation's future and the upcoming national construction efforts. The joint Party, government, and military conference decided on the methods to comfort the Allied forces and American troops stationed in China the day before yesterday. In addition to generally distributing comfort items, the municipal authorities will also invite Allied soldiers to gather for a celebration to thank them for their hard work and contributions to the Allied war effort and their time stationed in China. The municipal government and its affiliated bureaus will only take one day off during New Year's Day to expedite their work, and other industries will follow this example, as they do not want to miss this good trading opportunity. However, the banking industry will continue to take three days off as usual for year-end closing, and will resume business as usual from the 4th. Movie theaters are competing to show the most exciting new movies to entertain guests, and Beijing opera and drama theaters will add evening performances. The football league organized by the Municipal Sports Association will also launch its first major battle on New Year's Day. Citizens are planning where to spend this joyful holiday to release the frustrations they have suffered for the past eight years. Recently, there have been rumors that the curfew will be lifted during the New Year's Eve and New Year holidays. A reporter from this newspaper inquired with the relevant authorities and learned that this is not the case. However, a special pass will be issued on New Year's Eve similar to Christmas. In addition to Allied military and civilians, Chinese citizens with legitimate reasons can also apply to the municipal government for a pass. Those without a pass will still be strictly prohibited from traveling during curfew hours. Citizens are advised to pay attention.

### All Zhejiang Associations Hold Tea Party - Welcome Sun Xiaolou Yesterday - Hope to Actively Promote Relief Work

The All Zhejiang Associations, together with the Ningbo, Shaoxing, Jiaxing, Wenzhou, Quzhou, Fenghua, Zhenhai, Dinghai, Huzhou, Xiangshan, and other Shanghai-based native place associations, held a tea party at 3:00 p.m. yesterday on the fourth floor of the Ningbo Native Place Association to welcome Sun Xiaolou, Director of the Zhejiang-Fujian Branch of the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, to express their welcome and to present the relief needs in various places.

Chairman's Speech

Over fifty people attended including He Bingsong, He Dekui, Liu Hongsheng, Fang Jiaobo, Wang Yansong, and other Zhejiang natives in Shanghai, as well as representatives from various native place associations. Chairman Wang Xiaolai delivered a speech, saying that the counties of Zhejiang Province have suffered severely during the eight years of the war of resistance, and the disaster-stricken people after the war are urgently in need of relief. He hoped that Director Sun would tell them about the principles and steps for Zhejiang's relief. At the same time, he also hoped that everyone present would tell Director Sun about the disaster situation in Zhejiang's counties and the real need for relief as a reference for providing assistance.

Three Major Principles

Director Sun said in his speech that during the eight years of the War of Resistance, most of the counties in Zhejiang Province were occupied, and millions of people were in deep water and fire. He will follow the Central Government's orders and local public opinion to do his best to carry out relief work, adhering to three principles: (1) Speed: Distribute all relief supplies quickly to those who need relief. (2) Fairness: We will provide relief to those who truly need relief. We will absolutely not provide relief to those who are living well and trying to obtain relief supplies. (3) Universality: Provide relief to the general public suffering from disasters.

Key Points of Relief

The office currently has several important things to do in Zhejiang and Fujian: (1) Eradicate plague and malaria. (2) Relieve the food shortage. (3) Revive agriculture and fisheries. In addition, the seawalls near Haiyan and other counties are also planned to be repaired to prevent floods. Representatives from various villages and associations then expressed their opinions. A Shaoxing representative hoped that relief work would go deep into the countryside, with towns more important than cities. A Jiaxing representative said that Jiaxing needs mulberry saplings, silkworm eggs, and fertilizer. A Taizhou representative said that they need medicines and cotton seeds. A Dinghai representative appealed for relief to the fishermen in Dinghai and its surrounding areas.

Eight Opinions

### Yang Changji's Trial Concluded Yesterday - Sentencing Scheduled - Served as a Japanese Military Police Assistant and Committed Many Evils

The traitor Yang Changji served as a Japanese military police assistant in the Japanese Northern Railway Station Military Police Team for many years during the enemy-puppet era. He was responsible for inspecting luggage and goods at the Northern Railway Station. All valuable luggage and goods of merchants traveling to and from the station were often confiscated by him without cause. After the Japanese surrendered, Yang fled to other places in an attempt to escape justice.

Traitor Arrested on Train to Shanghai

Unexpectedly, in early October of this year, Yang was taking a train to Shanghai at Kunshan Railway Station, and he happened to be seen by the victims Wang Lianfang, Wang Ada, and other solo merchants. The Wangs followed him to Shanghai, and after getting off the train, they took him to the military police team. After questioning by the team, he was transferred to the High Prosecutor's Office for investigation and verification. The office then filed a public prosecution with the High Court in accordance with Article 2, Section 8 of the Regulations on Punishment of Traitors. Yesterday morning at 10:00 a.m., Judge Liu _gui, Cao Jun, Zhu Zonghai, and Prosecutor Lin Wopeng of the High Court opened a court meeting for trial. Yang initially tried to deny his actions in every possible way. The court temporarily detained him and summoned the informant Wang Lianfang to court. According to Wang, "I used to be a solo merchant. In 1941, I carried a box of western medicine, planning to take it to Jinhua by train for sale. Unexpectedly, it was found by Yang and confiscated. Because Jinhua was still in the hands of the National Army at that time, the Japanese military police suspected that I was related to the government and subjected me to torture. First, they poured cold water on me, and then they whipped me with leather whips. Fortunately, I was released soon. There were dozens of such incidents every day.

Solo Female Merchant Sexually Assaulted

Yang's biggest crime was that any vulnerable woman running a solo business, if she had any beauty, could not escape his clutches. Yang Changji, also known as Little Yang, had more than ten wives and concubines. Travelers would tremble at his name as if he were a demon. My complaint against him this time is only to seek justice for countless victims." At this time, the court summoned Yang Changji to court again and confronted him with the facts provided by the plaintiff. However, Yang still tried to deny it, claiming that Wang had personal grudges against him, that he did not serve as a Japanese military police assistant, and that he only worked as a supervisor at the Mitsubishi Wharf. However, the court considered that the case was clear, and after the defendant's lawyer made a defense for Yang, the court decided that the case would be sentenced at 2:00 p.m. on January 4.

### Relief Agency Issues Flour: Thorough Investigation Procedures

The Relief and Rehabilitation Administration's second phase of flour distribution began yesterday (the 28th). Purchasers are required to complete payment procedures at the bank first. The agency is conducting very thorough investigations of each applicant merchant. It is reported that a small number of retailers could not be investigated because their addresses were unclear. Moreover, it is inevitable that some have no store at all, while others are not flour retailers at all. To prevent this, the agency will immediately collect and suspend the issuance of registration certificates for these applicants when they make payments at the Zhongfu Bank. Those whose addresses are unclear or whose house numbers are incorrect, etc., can submit a written explanation to the agency, which will send staff to reinvestigate. If they are indeed flour retailers, the certificate will be reissued.

As soon as these relief supplies are packaged, they will be shipped to China in full by the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration.

### Nine Soldiers Detained for Disturbing Cinema

[Our Newspaper] At approximately 2:15 PM yesterday, while a film was playing at the Huguang Cinema on Zhongzheng Middle Road, seven or eight soldiers suddenly burst into the manager's office, demanding fifteen complimentary tickets. When a female employee surnamed Guan asked if they had a coupon or proof of identification, one soldier, without asking why, grabbed the telephone receiver from the table and threw it. The manager, Shi Tingpan, politely tried to reason with him, but was struck on the head with a gun butt, causing him to bleed profusely. Several other soldiers waited outside the room. Hearing the commotion inside, they immediately smashed the six large glass doors at the entrance. Several others then rushed upstairs, destroying all the glass windows on the second and third floors. The audience at the first showing, seeing this situation, scattered in all directions, causing great disorder. Tables and chairs were extensively damaged. At that moment, a patrol team from the Shanghai-Songhu Garrison Headquarters happened to pass by. After receiving a report, they entered the cinema and detained the nine soldiers responsible for the incident for investigation. The injured manager, Shi Tingpan, took himself to the hospital for treatment.

### US Military Offices Use Electric Heaters for Warmth

After Christmas, the winter weather here is getting colder, and the air is chilly in the early mornings and evenings. For several years, offices and residential areas have lacked stoves and heating equipment. The heating equipment in large buildings and hotels was mostly dismantled or damaged by the Japanese and is no longer usable. The U.S. military mostly uses electric heaters in the buildings and apartments they occupy, while offices mostly use coal stoves. According to a report from the US military headquarters engineer, since the beginning of winter, the US military has installed as many as sixty or seventy stoves in various offices for heating. US military personnel traveling in jeeps often cover their knees with military blankets. The business of bars has been even better since the weather turned cold. The US military says that drinking can ward off some of the cold.

### Secrets of the Atlantic Undersea War

— Li Mu

In 1942, German submarines sank 1,161 British and American merchant ships. If Hitler's submarine weapons had continued this destructive efficiency, Britain would have been unable to survive long ago, the Soviet Union would not have been victorious, and the Far East war against Japan and the fate of Britain and the United States would have been unimaginable. Both sides knew that this was a life-and-death struggle. Therefore, the United States transferred 1.5 million troops to the Atlantic and mobilized thousands of famous scientists to study day and night how to resist Germany's secret weapons.

Acoustic Torpedoes

The first secret underwater weapon used by Germany was an acoustic torpedo. After the torpedo was fired from the submarine's launcher in the direction of the enemy ship, it would seek out the sound emitted by the ship's propellers. This "acoustic torpedo," like a hound sniffing out a rabbit, traveled through the water. As long as it heard a faint sound from the ship's propellers, it would follow the sound until it hit the hull and exploded. No matter how the approaching ship turned, it turned even more skillfully; no matter how fast the ship moved, it followed even faster. In addition, it had a terrible ability to seek out the largest target in a group of transport ships and destroy it. When a small ship approached a large ship, the torpedo would immediately turn and head for the ship with the largest hull and the loudest sound.

Sound-Absorbing Rubber

The British and American navies and scientists, to counter this acoustic torpedo, invented a sound emitter, which guided the torpedo to another sound emitter and finally to a place without ships. The invention of British and American radar detectors caused great panic among the Germans, because radar used subtle sound waves on the seabed, and when it touched the entity of a submarine, there would be an echo, revealing the location of the submarine. The Germans invented a rubber that wrapped around the entire submarine, and when sound waves touched it, they would be absorbed by the rubber. Germany finally researched and developed sound-absorbing rubber, the effect of which was that if a room was sealed with this rubber, two people talking to each other in the room could not hear each other at all. Subsequently, they invented a gelatinous substance to stick the rubber to the submarine. But this rubber still caused some echo of sound waves. They also invented an underwater gun that fired chemical projectiles that could emit sound, disturbing sound waves.

Wolf Pack Strategy

German submarine strategy had three major reforms, one of which was the "wolf pack strategy." Cruising submarines were gathered in one place, and only when their numbers exceeded those of the British and American escort fleets would they attack together. The British and Americans used bomber groups equipped with radar and bombs to disrupt this strategy. Because submarines must surface after being submerged for twenty-four hours to release the fuel fumes in the submarine's cabin, and they lost their power when they surfaced. As a result, they researched and developed a diesel ventilator that could double the speed of the submarine at a depth of forty feet below the surface, making British and American aircraft and radar detectors ineffective. But the Germans admitted that this experiment was successful a year and a half late. Hitler's last desperate attempt to send six submarines to attack the US coastline ended with the entire number being sunk by British and American warship nets and aircraft groups after several difficult battles.

The last major German submarine strategy was to improve submarines so that they could go as deep as seven hundred feet below the surface while still maintaining an amazing speed of fifteen knots per hour. Unfortunately, it was too late. Someone asked Admiral Keilpatric; If British and American methods of resisting submarines have progressed so much in the last three years, are submarines still ineffective? He replied: "If Germany has a chance to try again, they will still try using submarines."

Sketch

### Blind News Vendor

— Yang Tongfang

The day before yesterday morning, I passed the corner of Henan Road and Fuzhou Road and saw a blind news vendor with no sight in his eyes, holding a large stack of newspapers in one hand and a bamboo cane in the other, standing on the sidewalk shouting to sell various daily newspapers. He looked to be just over twenty years old, a handsome young man.

Seeing that blind news vendor, I couldn't help but feel a pang of pity. I immediately bought a few copies from him, watched him for a long time, and wanted to chat with him. My office has all kinds of newspapers, so the reason I bought them from him was originally out of a feeling of compassion. I asked him, "On the street where cars and horses rush around, why do you still sell newspapers when you can't see?" He said, "There's no way. To make a living, I have to sell some newspapers. My hometown is in Dachang, and the war destroyed everything I had. I've been blind since I was a child and attended the Nanjing Municipal School for the Blind and Deaf, graduating from there. I am very happy that people like me still have the opportunity to receive education." Hearing the name of the Nanjing Municipal School for the Blind and Deaf, I sank into clear memories: Because I had a friend, Mr. Ye Binghua, who had received professional training in teaching the blind and deaf, who served as the director of instruction at that school during the August 13th Incident. When I was in Nanjing, I went there a few times, so I knew more about the situation of that school. I continued to say to him: "Oh, you graduated from the Nanjing School for the Blind and Deaf. That school is very well-run, and the equipment is very complete, with a level equivalent to a fairly complete primary school. Do you still remember Mr. Ye Binghua?" As soon as he heard me mention Mr. Ye's name, his face immediately showed a very kind and joyful expression. He asked me about his recent situation, and I roughly told him some things.

Regarding this blind news vendor in front of me, I found his attitude to be very sincere and his conversation very charming. I then asked about his family background. His words deeply moved me. At this time, I thought of the countless blind people in the world who cannot see even a glimmer of light. Their innate defects rob them of the light of life, which is truly pitiful. He said that although his eyes cannot see anything, his state of mind is very bright. "In these past eight years, my experiences have been extremely bitter. My mother died, my wife and children were separated, and my older brother, the only one who supported the whole family and provided me with school fees, who worked as a teacher at the Zhenjiang Normal School attached primary school before the war, was falsely accused and killed by the Japanese invaders after the war broke out. Since then, my family has been destroyed, and I have been reduced to this state." From his furrowed brow, one could see the pain in his heart, and he finally broke down and lost his voice, like a broken-stringed erhu that could not make a sound. After a long pause, he recounted that although he had encountered misfortune, he still insisted that the profession he chose must be beneficial to education and culture. To uphold national justice and promote spiritual culture, he finally chose the profession of selling newspapers. Although this profession is very difficult, shouting for half a day still cannot support one's life. I couldn't find any words to comfort him, only saying this: "On the multi-forked road of life, be careful of your steps!"

The streets were filled with rushing cars and horses, and the sounds of people were loud, not a place for long conversations. I squeezed through the crowd and looked back at the back of the blind news vendor who had encountered such misery, slowly disappearing into the crowd. I thought about how that blind news vendor's innate defects had deprived him of the happiness of life. I also thought that although he was blind, his childhood experiences were not so bad, with a loving mother and older brother warming his desolate heart, and later with a wife and children who could comfort him. But now everything is over, all become bubbles. I thought even more about the cruelty of the war, which had reduced him to wandering the streets, drifting in an endless and desolate world. Loneliness, sorrow, melancholy, and desolation were certainly already destined for his fate, but I felt that the brilliance of his personality would always make people feel that his heart was bright, perhaps even brighter than those with sight—righteousness and wisdom shining brightly on his heart, without any flaws. He was not like some sighted people, who were blinded and obscured by all kinds of poisonous flames of evil, greed, flattery, and meanness.

Sir Walter Scott once praised the blind, saying that the light in their hearts replaced the light in their eyes. Throughout history, many blind people have achieved many things with their clear minds. The Russian female poet Eroshchenko, who sang about the "desert-like loneliness" of her heart, was blind, but the brilliance of her poems will forever illuminate the world of literature, and her fairy tales have reached the highest level of artistic achievement, unfolding an incomparably bright world before us. Helen Keller in the United States was also blind, but through her perseverance and continuous hard work in the face of her unfortunate circumstances, she eventually completed her university studies, laid the foundation for her scholarship, and eventually became a great social entrepreneur, making a great contribution to humanity. Although the blind do not have light in their eyes, they can pursue a bright future.

Victor Hugo, the great French writer, was the precursor of Romanticism. In a novel of his, he described a blind musician who, with his extraordinary musical talent, played out his desolate and bitter experience on a three-stringed instrument, deeply moving people. An architect who had the same experiences as him was so moved by his art of "empathy" that tears streamed down his face in front of everyone. Maupassant also had a story about a blind female worker who, with her crisp and melodious singing voice, moved the audience and found a lifelong companion in her desolate life journey, the main medium being a song.

The blind news vendor I encountered this time had deep pain hidden in his heart. How could he tell people about it? He was not the poet, social entrepreneur, musician, or singer mentioned earlier. His sorrow was much deeper than those blind artists because he could not express his feelings and innermost thoughts. His pain was forever hidden deep in his heart, yet his contribution to society was very great. He did not choose other professions commonly done by the blind but sold newspapers on the roadside like a tiger's mouth. He himself could not directly receive the spiritual and cultural nourishment but distributed this precious nourishment to others to enjoy. What a noble profession!

I heard that the "Daily Mail" in England has a braille edition specially published for the blind, so the blind can learn about the world's major events, national and social news every day. After listening to the blind news vendor, I felt that he was indeed a young man full of a sense of justice, and his thirst for knowledge was very strong. But who will satisfy him? When will he have the right to read newspapers?

On the way home, I thought about these questions, and I couldn't help but shout: "Save that blind news vendor! Save the blind!"

### Five Kinds of Snails in Ningbo

— Ji'e (Hates Evil)

During the period when Ningbo was occupied, the suffering of the people was beyond description. Even considering the five kinds of snails that the people compared it to, one can see a glimpse.

(1) Fragrant Snail—Originally, the fragrant snail is a kind of seafood. The people of Yong use it to accompany meals and regard it as a delicacy, but the people use the similar sound of "fragrant snail" to "xiang lu" (鄉擄), referring to the county magistrate, meaning that the county magistrate used the township and town offices as looting agencies.

(2) Field Snail—Field snails are products of farmland everywhere. At that time, the people of Yong said that the township and town chiefs not only supplied the enemy puppet agencies but also entertained the guerrilla units and government agencies, covering all aspects. In addition, the township and town chiefs themselves were also heavily laden with money, buying fields and building houses, and gambling wildly. The source of looting by the township and town chiefs came from farmers, so they recognized the township and town chiefs as "tian lu" (田擄 - field plunderers).

(3) Spicy Snail—The spicy snail is also a seafood product. At that time, puppet army sentry posts were densely distributed. Whenever people passed through their territory, whether they were small businesses or using everyday items, they had to pay taxes. In addition, puppet police were stationed every five steps, extorting along the way, never letting go. The people therefore called these people "le" (勒 - force) "lu" (擄 - plunderers) (in the Yong dialect, "block" and "force" have the same sound).

(4) Snail—The people of Su call it "luo," while the people of Yong call it "si luo." In fact, they are the same thing. At that time, the guerrilla units, out of concern for the enemy puppets, did not dare to openly demand from the people when they needed something, so they had to send letters to threaten or secretly negotiate, mostly settling privately. Therefore, the people of Ningbo called the sea guerrilla units "si lu" (私擄 - private plunderers) (si luo - 螄螺).

(5) Mud Snail—The mud snail is also a seafood product. In the past, Mr. Yu Qiaqing would not be happy without this when having meals at banquets. However, the mud snail referred to by the people of Ningbo at that time referred to the bandit army. Because the bandit army would go to the countryside to eat and live during the autumn harvest every year, it was called "nian lu" (年擄 - annual plunderers) (ni luo - 泥螺).

News Report

### A First Look at the Newsreel of Chairman's Visit to Beiping

— Mo Ying

The events of Chairman Chiang's visit to Beiping were filmed by China Electric and transported to Shanghai. The reporter had the honor of seeing it first, for which I am extremely grateful. The film captures the scenery of Beiping and depicts the frenzy of the general public after the Chairman and his wife arrived in Beiping, as if painted vividly. The Chairman's admonitions to the elders of Beiping are earnest and moving. The sound recording is clear, as if we were gathered together. The Chairman's visit to the Ancient Relics Exhibition Hall, although the indoor lighting is not good, the shots are still clear. Generals like Li Zongren are also on camera. The grand scene of addressing the students in front of the Hall of Supreme Harmony, which was recently filmed, is particularly magnificent and great. No less than hundreds of thousands of students from various schools were in attendance, with flags flying and lines neatly arranged. The Chairman encouraged the youth to strengthen their bodies, cultivate their character, and diligently study, as well as follow the Three Principles of the People. He also expressed much consolation for the oppression and suffering endured by the people of Beiping during the War of Resistance. For a time, the students' shouts shook the heavens and the earth. The collective excitement of the youth of North China was unprecedented in decades. After the speech, the students spontaneously rushed to the high platform, surrounding the Chairman. The Chairman traveled lightly that day, readily approaching the youth. The reporter was greatly moved by viewing this film. The newsreel will soon be seen by audiences in Shanghai.

### Reviving the National Calendar

— Xiyuan

The Republic of China has been established for thirty-four years, but the most important "zhenshuo" (正朔 - official calendar) of the nation, which is changing to the solar calendar, that is, the "national calendar" that defines the name and distinguishes the roles, has still not been universally implemented. This is a great disgrace to the nation and internationally. Now, countries around the world, including England, do not use the solar calendar, and some people have argued that the solar calendar is not yet suitable and should be replaced with other new calendars. In our country, since the official promulgation of the use of the solar calendar in the first year of the Republic, the government offices have implemented the solar calendar on the surface, but in reality, the general public, such as the education and business sectors, still use the lunar calendar, but they only take one day off during the solar New Year. This is still forgivable in the rural countryside, and there is still some reason to say that it is because they have to rely on the twenty-four solar terms to farm. But in the cities, using it on the surface but not in practice, what is called "yang feng yin wei" (陽奉陰違 - outwardly compliant but inwardly disobedient) is really too inappropriate!

In the past, the Japanese invaders occupied the coastal provinces and vigorously promoted the lunar calendar in Shanghai and Nanjing. They celebrated the solar New Year in Hongkou with great excitement, letting us celebrate the lunar New Year, indicating that China was backward, old-fashioned, and a "phenomenon of national subjugation." Therefore, whenever there were lunar festivals, such as the "Mid-Autumn Festival" and the "Dragon Boat Festival," they were also particularly energetic. Mooncakes and zongzi were expensive in those eight years, but sales were higher than in previous years. The general public thought it was a matter of course, and some people thought it was the "benevolent governance" of the Japanese invaders. As for the official calendar of the Republic of China, it had long been thrown to the winds.

Now that the War of Resistance has been won, everything must be revived and restored. I recall that in the years 1935 and 1936, the central government strictly ordered all localities to implement the national calendar and abolish the old calendar. On Lunar New Year's Day, schools had to hold classes, workers had to go to work, businesses were not allowed to close, and newspapers were not allowed to stop publishing. At that time, it was carried out vigorously, and the national spirit and the atmosphere of Shanghai were revitalized. At that time, there was also the New Life Movement Promotion Association, which worked hard to publicize and promote the slogans of the national calendar, which were all over the walls. If there had been no War of Resistance against Japan, perhaps the national calendar would have been universally implemented by now.

Now, the thirty-fourth year of the Republic has come to an end. The general public does not seem to be interested in the New Year's Day of the thirty-fifth year, as if they still have to wait for the Lunar New Year to have a good time. This is really inappropriate. I hope that the government and the New Life Movement Promotion Association will reaffirm the clear orders, as vigorously as in the years 1935 and 1936, and launch another official calendar movement. This is what the author hopes for very much!

### Ambition

— Shanmin (Mountain Dweller)

Generally speaking, everyone has ambition. However, ambition has differences in size, good and bad, and whether it can be realized.

The size of ambition varies according to each person's age and environment. The younger the age, the smaller the ambition is likely to be; the better the environment, the larger the ambition is likely to be. There are countless examples of this.

The goodness or badness of ambition varies according to its nature. All who are willing to serve the public and are willing to sacrifice themselves when necessary have good ambitions; conversely, those who hope to enslave and sacrifice others to seek their own happiness have bad ambitions. From this, we can find a dividing line between good and bad ambitions.

Whether an ambition can be realized depends first on whether the ambition is good or bad, second on whether the ambition has the possibility of being realized, and third on the degree of personal ability and determination. If an ambition is good and can be realized, and has the ability and determination, it will inevitably be realized.

We should have ambition so that the power of life can be expressed; however, this ambition must be based on benefiting others; otherwise, it will not only ruin ourselves but also implicate others.

### Advice for the Temporary University

— Xi

Editor: Your newspaper published news on the screening for the preparatory class of the Temporary University on the 26th. Here are some of my opinions. Please publish it in the social services section for the students of the Temporary University. The preparatory class of the Temporary University only has two groups, arts and sciences. Under the circumstances of repeated loss of schooling, I had no choice but to apply to the science group. Although I deeply know that the science group is not very similar to the business courses I studied before, the business courses such as bookkeeping, accounting, typing, and abacus are not within the scope of the screening, and I have never studied the science subjects such as physics, chemistry, biology, analytical geometry, and higher algebra. This screening invisibly gave me a big blow. I hope that the authorities of the preparatory class of the Temporary University will first examine the schools and eliminate the students of the schools that are now non-existent or cannot be considered satisfactory. In this way, on the one hand, the trouble of "overcrowding" can be reduced, and on the other hand, it can serve as a warning to those who set up rogue schools. The second step is to classify the high school courses of each student, such as science, engineering, and business, and then conduct the screening. Although this is a more troublesome procedure, it is the most common method.

Searching for Sun Tianmin (also known as Sun Ruochen)

A native of Shandong, he served as a director at the Shanghai Dadong Film Company before the war. After the August 13th Incident, he joined Wu Lizhu's troupe in Nanyang, and then served as the director of the Hong Kong New World Film Company, and then transferred to Taishan Film Company as the chief director. At that time, there was still news from home, but since the Pacific War, there has been no news at all. If anyone knows his whereabouts, please send a letter to No. 5 Qing'an Lane, Dingnan Road, which would be a great merit.

Xu Wenwei, a native of Chongde County, Zhejiang, once worked in a large cloth shop in Hangzhou. He usually expressed his desire to join the army. He suddenly went missing when victory was near, and has been missing for several months with no news at all. His mother has passed away, and his father is old and sick with longing for his son. If anyone knows his whereabouts, please send a letter to Mr. Wu at No. 82 Hengkang, East Chang'an Street, Zhejiang, which would be greatly appreciated.

Zhang Chenglian is looking for his son Zhang Wenxun, a native of Lujiang, Anhui, who served as the principal of the Jianyi Elementary School of Chaotian Palace Gongjianfang in Nanjing for many years. After the outbreak of the war, he moved inland with the government. Two years ago, someone met Xun on the way to Hengyang. According to him, he was serving in the 1st Honorary Division at that time, living in Liuzhou. Unfortunately, his address was not recorded, and there has been no communication for eight years. His mother has come to Shanghai from Liyang to seek refuge, making a living on her own. She is very poor, crying day and night, and has fallen ill with longing for her son. If any friends or classmates of Wenxun know his whereabouts, please send a letter to "No. 5, Lane 552, Hed Road, Shanghai," so that the noble son can reunite with his family as soon as possible, and the grace of rebirth will be infinitely grateful.

### On Worry-Free Smoking Cessation (4)

— Hu Qipeng

V. Methods and Selection of Smoking Cessation

Smoking cessation methods can be briefly described as follows:

(1) Gradual Reduction Method: This method uses several kinds of anesthetic drugs to gradually reduce the amount, so as to cut off the smoking habit and avoid the pain of withdrawal symptoms.

(2) Serum Smoking Cessation Method: This method involves drawing a certain amount of the smoker's own blood every day and injecting it into their muscles to resist nicotine poisoning, or using a drug applied to the skin to make it blister, and then drawing the serum from the blister and injecting it back into the human body, which is the blistering smoking cessation method. However, this method still needs to be used with a gradual reduction of appropriate anesthetics, but the abstinence period can be shortened due to the injection of serum.

(3) Sleep Smoking Cessation Method: This method uses a considerable amount of sleeping pills to make the abstinent person unconscious, unaware of the pain of addiction, and achieve the purpose of abstinence in about three to five days. This is the so-called drunken rapid abstinence method, but if used carelessly, it can easily cause dangerous symptoms.

(4) Drug Smoking Cessation Method: This method uses drugs that can relieve withdrawal symptoms or resist nicotine poisoning, such as atropine, magnesium sulfate, organic calcium, bromine, lecithin, etc., to reduce the pain of addiction and achieve the purpose of breaking the addiction.

(5) Spiritual Smoking Cessation Method: Those who abstain without using drugs, relying on their personal determination, the power of faith, or the methods of superstitious gods and doctrines, are all spiritual smoking cessation methods. Doctors often apply spiritual suggestion therapy to those who seek to abstain to reduce the psychology of fear.

In summary, each smoking cessation method has its own advantages and disadvantages. Based on my experience, it is necessary to determine according to the depth of the smoker's nicotine addiction, the strength of the body, the reason for smoking, and the economic ability and environmental situation. However, the most appropriate method is to focus on the gradual reduction method. And give appropriate tonics to assist according to the needs of the body. The cells and tissues of the human body have been constantly supplied with nicotine poison for a long time, and have developed an indispensable habit. Now, if you want to get rid of this habit, it must take a considerable amount of time, so the gradual reduction method is the most reasonable. However, for those who are addicted to smoking due to illness, attention must also be paid to their original illness to avoid recurrence. (To be continued tomorrow)

Letters to the Editor

### Soliciting Kidney Edema Treatment Requesting Famous Doctors in Shanghai to Provide Effective Prescriptions

A reader of this newspaper, Mr. Qu Cunpu, wrote: Editor, I am from northern Jiangsu. I recently received a letter from home saying that many people in the countryside have suffered from edema, and both Chinese and Western doctors have given up. Recently, my relative also suffered from this disease, which has been going on for half a year. After a hospital examination, it was said that it was kidney edema. My relative is in her thirties, female, has not had her period for five months, urinates very little, is afraid of cold and vomits, does not know hunger or satiety, has a husky voice, a large abdomen and swollen feet, and is edematous. The edema in the face is particularly severe. At the moment, the edema in her hands and feet has receded, but she is afraid to take medicine, and vomits as soon as she takes it. Because there are no famous doctors in the countryside for treatment, she has not fully recovered. In addition, she cannot come to Shanghai for treatment. I wonder if it is possible to publish this letter in the social service column of your newspaper, so that famous doctors in Shanghai can prescribe the right medicine so that she can buy and take the medicine according to the prescription. If major doctors give effective pills, she will be grateful for more than just my relative alone.

(Note) There are no specialist doctors in the countryside, and patients are suffering deeply! Please famous doctors in Shanghai provide treatment methods for the above symptoms and send them to this newspaper for forwarding, which would be a great merit.
