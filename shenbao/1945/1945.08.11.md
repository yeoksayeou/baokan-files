### Imperial Japanese Headquarters Announced Yesterday: Battle Situation on the Soviet-Manchurian Border; Part of Soviet Army on Sakhalin Island Begins Offensive

Tokyo, 10th (Central News Agency) - The Imperial Japanese Headquarters announced at 3:20 PM on the 10th that the main battle situations on August 9th were as follows:

Part of the Japanese air force attacked enemy mobile forces east of Miyagi Prefecture on the afternoon of the 9th, confirming the destruction and burning of one enemy large warship, and achieving considerable other results.

The Soviet forces on the eastern and western Manchurian-Soviet borders gradually increased their forces. This afternoon, parts of their forces invaded areas near Hiter on the northern Manchurian-Soviet border, including areas west of Zilen and near Gyeongheung in northern Korea. Japanese forces in those areas immediately engaged, and are currently in battle.

A Japanese convoy sailing in the eastern sea off northern Korea engaged with approximately 80 Soviet aircraft this afternoon, shooting down 14 of them with no losses on our side.

A part of the Soviet army on the Sakhalin border began attacking us this afternoon.

Xinjing, 10th (Central News Agency) - The Kwantung Army announced at 11:00 PM on the 9th: The Soviet army subsequently forcibly and illegally invaded on the entire front of the Manchurian-Soviet border. Parts of their forces successively invaded Manchuria from the fronts of Hunchun, Suifenhe, and Manzhouli. The Japanese and Manchurian armies have united and are resolutely fighting back.

Xinjing, 10th (Central News Agency) - The Korean Army District Headquarters announced at 6:00 PM on August 10th: The Soviet forces invading the northern Korean border are weak, with only a small number of aircraft. Their air zone is limited to the north of Chongjin. For self-defense, our forces are now engaging the enemy land and air forces.

Tokyo, 10th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese Northern Army District Headquarters announced on the 10th: A small number of Soviet troops crossed the border line at 2:00 PM on the 9th and invaded near "Pijia" in Japanese territory, attacking the southwest area of that location.

### Japanese Minister of War Issues Proclamation to All Troops; Director-General of Information Bureau Also Encourages All People

Tokyo, 10th (Central News Agency) - Japanese Minister of War Anami issued a proclamation to all army troops on the 10th, entitled "Address to All Officers and Soldiers," demanding that all fight for the holy war to protect the mainland under the difficult circumstances, and declaring the firm resolve of the entire army.

Tokyo, 10th (Central News Agency) - The Director-General of the Japanese Information Bureau issued a statement at 3:30 PM on the 10th as follows: "The recent air raids by the American and British forces against Japan have intensified, while they are also preparing for a landing operation on the mainland. The Japanese army and navy are fully prepared to engage them. With the vigorous fighting spirit of all special attack forces, we are confident in decisively defeating and driving away the enemy. We hope the people will endure the enemy's brutal bombing and advance with a spirit of righteous volunteer service, which is truly commendable. The United States and Britain have recently used newly invented bombs, inflicting tragedy on innocent old people, young children, and women. Furthermore, on the 9th, the Soviet Union, which had neutral relations with Japan, also joined the enemy camp, unilaterally declaring war and immediately attacking us. Our army is engaging them and will not allow the enemy to easily invade. It cannot be denied that we are facing the worst possible situation. To uphold the group, maintain the nation's honor, and protect our last possessions, the government has made its best efforts to unite the one hundred million people, and the people must also overcome all difficulties to protect the nation."

### U.S. President Truman Delivers Broadcast Speech Yesterday

Lisbon, 9th (Central News Agency) - According to a Washington dispatch: U.S. President Truman delivered a broadcast speech at 10:00 PM on the 9th, the gist of which was as follows: The military agreements decided at the Potsdam Conference must be kept secret, but one of these secret agreements was only known to the world yesterday, namely the Soviet Union's war against Japan. The Soviet Union agreed to participate in the war against Japan before receiving notification of the United States' secret weapon, the new type of bomb. However, apart from military agreements, no other agreements were signed at the Potsdam Conference. The most important thing that the representatives of the countries at the conference considered was achieving victory in the war against Japan. As a result of this war, the United States does not want to acquire new territories or other resources, but it will possess the necessary military bases to protect American interests. If the United States deems it necessary for bases that are not currently owned, it will possess them based on agreements that do not violate the International Charter. Now that the Japanese people have recognized the power of the United States' new type of bomb, if they still want to continue the war, the United States will continue to use this type of bomb against Japanese territory. The people of Europe are now in a very difficult situation. If we do not do everything we can to help them, then the sacrifices we have made will have been in vain.

### Apawan Maru Incident: U.S. Response to Japan

Lisbon, 10th (Central News Agency) - Washington Report: The transport ship Apawan Maru was sunk by a U.S. submarine on April 15th while sailing forward under the security guarantee of the United Nations. Regarding this matter, the U.S. State Department issued a reply telegram on June 29th to the Japanese government's note, which was re-submitted on May 16th, stating that the Apawan Maru was carrying UN supplies and relief goods for UN prisoners of war and civilians detained in Japan, and was sunk by a U.S. submarine while returning from Hong Kong, Singapore, and other ports under the security guarantee of the United Nations. The U.S. government's reply admitted responsibility for sinking the ship. Regarding Japan's request for immediate compensation for damages, it was proposed to postpone it until after the end of the war. At the same time, it was also agreed that the U.S. government would deal with the compensation for the ship with a completely fair attitude, regardless of the political situation at that time. In order to continue to provide relief supplies to UN prisoners of war and detainees, the U.S. government decided to transfer a U.S. ship with the same performance as the Apawan Maru to the Japanese government. The transfer conditions stated that the replacement ship was limited to transporting relief supplies and mail, and legal returnees. This condition would be decided after being agreed upon by the Japanese government. When the U.S. government presented this condition to the Japanese government, it also made it clear that the U.S. ship was not transferred as compensation for the damage to the Apawan Maru, but for the purpose of the intention previously declared by the Japanese government.

Editorial

### Fourth Discussion on the Kuomintang's Constitutionalism

After reading Mr. Chen Gongbo's article "Re-examination of the Kuomintang," we not only know that Mr. Gongbo's serious criticism of the Kuomintang is entirely based on the Kuomintang's highest responsible person, "only because he loves it deeply, so he speaks of it earnestly," but also that Mr. Gongbo's article is "not only for comrades in a certain region, but for comrades throughout the country." In fact, standing in an external position, we are also greatly moved by this article and place our sincere hopes on the Chinese Kuomintang. Mr. Gongbo said: "National construction cannot exclude the Kuomintang, and anti-communism cannot exclude the Kuomintang." Mr. Gongbo therefore hopes that the general youth of the country "should criticize the Kuomintang as much as possible and cooperate in the transformation of the Kuomintang." We take this opportunity to express our ardent love for the Kuomintang and the Republic of China.

The Kuomintang has fifty years of glorious history, countless experiences and lessons left to the national people by the martyrs, and the supreme principles of saving the country and the people left by Mr. Sun Yat-sen—the Three Principles of the People, the Plan for National Construction, the Outline of National Construction, and the declaration of the First National Congress. All of these are not only in the past, but also today and in the future, the basis for the revival and construction of the Republic of China. Therefore, the national people, regardless of region, should support the Kuomintang in leading the country, implementing all the points in Mr. Sun Yat-sen's will, which encourage the entire party to work hard, implement the Three Principles of the People, the Plan for National Construction, the Outline of National Construction, and the declaration of the First National Congress, especially convening the National Assembly and implementing constitutionalism, "must be realized in the shortest possible time." We hope that every member of the Kuomintang will carefully study this "Premier's Will" that everyone can recite and implement it sincerely. We firmly believe that as long as the Kuomintang does not violate Mr. Sun Yat-sen's will and implements this will in a down-to-earth manner, then any other party will certainly not be able to compete with the Kuomintang!

Mr. Gongbo pointed out in "Re-examination of the Kuomintang": "The Kuomintang founded the revolution and has a long history. In modern China, it is really impossible to find a party that is longer; the Kuomintang established the Republic of China and unified China and has its rich achievements. In modern China, it is really impossible to find a party that has more merit." This is not entirely a self-proclaimed arrogant statement, but is recognized by the national people. Therefore, we sincerely hope that every Kuomintang member can from now on increase their self-esteem and self-confidence; be proactive and reinvigorated. In particular, the leaders who are responsible for the leading sovereignty of the Kuomintang at all levels must adopt the attitude of the "magnificent and beautiful" Kuomintang as the largest party in the country, put away all suspicions and fears of the people and other parties, truly believe in the people, and assist the people. The people are the foundation for the Kuomintang's eternal existence and development. Similarly, treat non-partisans with fairness and impartiality, and treat other parties with generosity, then all non-partisans and other parties will immediately become the Kuomintang's external guard forces. At that time, it must be possible to say, as Mr. Gongbo said: "If anyone wants to eliminate the Kuomintang by force, it is impossible, and it is impossible to soften the Kuomintang by conspiracy!" In his later years, Mr. Sun Yat-sen admonished his party members that a revolutionary party must not rely on force, but on propaganda, and use propaganda to gain the people's spontaneous love, because the people's love is an invincible force. We deeply hope that today's national Kuomintang members will abide by Mr. Sun Yat-sen's teachings, especially when implementing constitutionalism in the future. For the sake of the Kuomintang, but also for the sake of the interests of the Republic of China.

### Trip to Taizhou

— Yifei

After the reporter finished visiting Gaoyou and Baoying, he returned to Jiangdu, and the next day (14th) made a trip to Taixian again. Taixian is located at the southern end of northern Jiangsu and is the only new city in northern Jiangsu that has prospered during the war. Because it has not been affected by artillery fire, the local cityscape is second only to Jiangdu in northern Jiangsu. According to the elders of Taixian, the local area was able to escape the war due to the painstaking defense of General Li Changjiang, who held the military and political power of Taizhou at that time. Therefore, to commemorate General Li and General Li Mingyang, there is the construction of "Mingjiang Road" to commemorate their memory.

In order to be quick, the reporter took a private car along the Yangtai Highway. The cost was very high, with each passenger paying 80,000 yuan for a one-way ticket, because the bridge in the middle of the highway was destroyed, and the China Railway bus has been out of service for more than a month, so there is no other way.

The car departed at 8:15. The car drove for about 20 minutes and passed the Wanfu Bridge, 10 li from Yangzhou. The bridge was built of cement and is about a li long. The project was huge and was supervised by Shen Boxian when Ying Chang was constructing Jiangsu in the 22nd year of the Republic of China. Eight li further, we arrived at Xiannu Temple. On the way, we passed four small bridges, and the highway was about a li away from the town. This town was historically the source of exorbitant taxes and levies. According to the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom period, the Qing court often suggested Qing officials raise funds by setting up checkpoints at Xiannu Temple to collect taxes, which was the later Likin. It was originally a temporary fundraising measure, but unexpectedly it was delayed for many years, and it was not until the government explicitly abolished it before the war. This is an anecdote in the history of China's tax system.

When the military car arrived here, passengers had to get out of the car, because they had arrived at the collapsed bridge. The car and passengers were ferried in batches by civilian boats to the other side. This bridge is called Jiangjia Bridge. According to the villagers, the bridge had been in disrepair for a long time and could not bear the weight. A month ago, a yellow-clothed man transported more than 60 rice carts from the countryside, and the driver informed him of the dangerous situation in advance, but he was unwilling to listen and forced the car to pass, resulting in a tragedy. At that time, people and cars fell into the river at the same time, killing and injuring several people. This can also serve as a warning to those who act recklessly without regard to the pros and cons.

After leaving Yangzhou, it took a total of two and a half hours to reach the bus station outside the north gate of Taixian County. This section of the Lincheng Highway is quite inclined, making it difficult for cars to drive, especially for heavy vehicles, which are prone to breakdowns.

Not far to the right of the bus station, one can see Mount Tai, one of the famous attractions of Taixian County. This "Mount Tai" is just a false name, and it is difficult to compare it with Mount Tai in Shandong Province, which is commonly known as "climbing Mount Tai and seeing the world as small." In fact, it is just a mound of earth only a dozen feet high. There is a house on the top that looks like a temple. It is said that it was once the headquarters of the First Group Army when General Li Changjiang was stationed in Taizhou.

Taixian Industry and Commerce

The largest road in Taixian is Mingjiang Road, which is a ring road built in the 29th year of the Republic of China along the old demolished city site. The most prosperous street in the urban area is Caiyi Street, near the North Gate of Mingjiang Road, with many tin foil shops and oil and cloth shops. The famous local products are cooking oil and sesame cakes. There are many small handicrafts in the local area. The largest in scale is the Tailai Flour Mill in Jiuli, 9 li from the city. The factory director is Mr. Zhang Fengsheng, a giant merchant from Ningbo. The factory was founded before the war and is large in scale. Even the packaging after the flour is made is done by machine, without manual labor. Its products are the Three Sheep brand, which sells well throughout northern Jiangsu. It used to be very prosperous and sold to other places. According to factory director Zhang, the current cost of wheat is too high, labor costs are high, and flour bags are scarce, which affects the production volume. The current output is only 20-30% of what it was before the war.

Agricultural Production and Education

Taixian County is divided into ten districts, with a total population of 1,071,261 people. The county covers an area of 21,163.900 hectares, and the area of farmland is 12,810.000 hectares. The number of cultivated acres accounts for about 60.5% of the total area.

Paddy fields account for about 65.1% of the total number of cultivated fields, while dry fields account for 34.9%.

The main agricultural products are rice, wheat, and beans, and cotton also has a considerable yield. The total output of rice is estimated at 115,000 dan (100 market catties), and the distribution center is Jiangyan Town, which belongs to the county, with an annual turnover of 1,000,000 dan of grain and 500,000 dan of rice. The next is Qutang Town, with a turnover of 15,000 dan of rice. The total annual sales volume of wheat in the county is 808,000 dan, with 800,000 dan in Jiangyan Town and 8,000 dan in Qutang. The total output of cotton is estimated at 500,000 dan. Among the distribution centers for agricultural products in northern Jiangsu, Jiangyan Town in Taixian County and the town in Dongtai County are the most famous.

Taixian's education is very developed because it is located at the gateway to northern Jiangsu and is the center of military and political affairs. In the autumn of the 31st year after the war, the only public school in the entire territory of northern Jiangsu, "Northern Jiangsu Public Model Middle School," was founded in Taixian. At first, the school's administration was under the jurisdiction of the Northern Jiangsu Headquarters, and then in the summer of the 32nd year, it was ordered to change to Jiangsu Provincial Taizhou Middle School, which was directly under the jurisdiction of the Provincial Department of Education. Until the Northern Jiangsu Pacification Commissioner's Office was established in [?], the Commissioner's Office also took care of civil affairs, so in the spring of this year, the school was renamed Northern Jiangsu Public Taizhou Middle School. The school is now divided into junior and senior high schools, with approximately 800 students. The first principal, Chen Yangwu, once served as the Minister of Education of Zhejiang Province. In addition to this school, there are also county middle schools, and the private Shimin Middle School, and Xiangxian Ancestral Hall Middle School. The latter's funding is the responsibility of local gentlemen and merchants who are enthusiastic about education, and is specially set up for poor and studious children in this county. Among the primary schools, the Chengdong Primary School established by the county is more complete.

### Chongqing-Soviet Relations Adjusted; Talks Underway; Both Sides Will Sign a Treaty

Stockholm, 10th (Central News Agency) - Chongqing Executive Yuan President Song Ziwen, accompanied by Wang Shijie and Hu Shize, is currently in Moscow holding the second round of talks with Chairman Stalin and Foreign People's Commissar Molotov on adjusting Chongqing-Soviet relations. According to news received here, both sides seem to be signing a treaty. Regarding this point, this agency published Molotov's remarks when meeting with a group of journalists on the 9th as follows: Foreign Commissar Molotov, when asked by a reporter whether Chongqing-Soviet relations would be based on a treaty, replied that he believed this issue was currently being discussed with representatives from Chongqing in Moscow.

Guangzhou, 10th (Central News Agency) - According to a Reuters dispatch from Moscow: Chongqing Executive Yuan President Song Ziwen, accompanied by the new Foreign Minister Wu Shijie, has visited the Soviet Union again. The purpose is to continue the Chongqing-Soviet negotiations that were interrupted by the Potsdam Conference. The US will provide spiritual assistance and Truman and Stalin will conduct discussions on this in Potsdam. The negotiations will then move to a formal stage. The conflict between the Kuomintang and the Communist armies in Shaanxi Province, with the Kuomintang armies besieging Yan'an, has given the Soviet Union a great impulse. Whether Song Ziwen's visit to the Soviet Union will be successful is still uncertain. A United Press dispatch from Washington on July 31 reported that it was questionable whether the Chongqing government's sudden change of foreign minister while in Moscow for negotiations had political reasons.

### Consistent US-Chongqing Policy on Communism

Guangzhou, 9th (Central News Agency dispatch) – According to news arriving from Yan'an: The Chongqing army's offensive in the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region is not merely a localized event but a planned attack. Another dispatch claims that the cause of the military conflict between the Nationalists and Communists is that the anti-Communist generals in Chongqing were instructed by the United States to express their determination toward Yan'an. Allegedly, after U.S. Army Commander General Wedemeyer stationed in Chongqing inspected the Nationalist-Communist confrontation lines for eleven days starting on July 1st, he secretly conferred with the leading anti-Communist figures in Chongqing, Hu Zongnan and Fu Zuoyi. Subsequently, he transferred a large number of American fighter planes to the airbases in Hanzhong and Ankang, providing the troops surrounding Yan'an with considerable assistance in the form of rocket artillery, tanks, and military supplies. Therefore, whether in military or political terms, this attack by the Chongqing army has a very strong American flavor. Another report claims that the U.S. Air Force is prepared to deploy if necessary. The above facts sufficiently prove that the United States and Chongqing have reached a consistent policy in dealing with the Chinese Communist Party.

### Sun Ke's Views on Resolving Disputes

Guangzhou, 10th (Central News Agency dispatch) – According to a United Press report from Chongqing: A United Press reporter, Laobs, met with Legislative Yuan President Sun Ke on the 4th to inquire about his opinion on the Chongqing-Yan'an dispute. It is reported that there is no other solution to the Chongqing-Yan'an relationship except through political means. The reporter's report is roughly as follows: The conflict between the Chongqing and Yan'an armies was originally a local incident, but because the strength of the Yan'an army has been expanding daily, it has provoked incidents in the area where the Chongqing army is stationed, making the conflict a natural outcome. The fighting in western Xi'an was actually a conflict between the security forces of both sides, because the Chongqing army had requested to pass through the Yan'an border area but was refused. However, it is a fact that Hu Zongnan's troops have begun to move towards the Chunhua area. The most appropriate way to resolve the Chongqing-Yan'an issue is to establish a coalition government through popular vote. However, even after the war, it will take a considerable period of time to achieve this. If the Chongqing side intends to restore southern and northern regions of the Yangtze River, disputes will inevitably arise. There is no other way to resolve the disputes except through political negotiations.

### Jiangsu Provincial Government Approves Daily Necessities Prices

Suzhou, 10th (Central News Agency dispatch) – In order to suppress prices and stabilize the people's livelihood, the Jiangsu Provincial Government continues to adopt the method of agreed prices for various daily necessities and has instructed various trade associations to submit price lists of various daily necessities for approval. Recently, the provincial government has approved the prices of seven types of goods, including cotton cloth, food, and general merchandise, which will be announced and implemented in the coming days.

### Cripps Elucidates British Policy Towards India

Zurich, 10th (Central News Agency dispatch) – According to a United Press report from London, the Minister of Trade, Stafford Cripps, explained to the agency's special correspondent the Attlee cabinet's policy towards India as follows: The Attlee cabinet will not repeat the mistake of undermining Anglo-Indian friendly relations due to the Wavell proposals. The new cabinet will not adopt a method of making India accept piecemeal solutions. The Labor Party cabinet is now planning a permanent solution to the Indian problem and will implement the solution as soon as possible within the possible range. Now is not the time to plan piecemeal solutions. In short, Cripps hinted that the Labor cabinet will actively work on resolving the Indian question in the coming month.

### Chongqing Price Index Exceeds Pre-War Levels by a Thousand Times

Lisbon, 10th (Central News Agency dispatch) – A dispatch from Chongqing: The general price level in Chongqing in July rose by another 16% compared to June. The current price index is 1,832 times the pre-war level.

### Executive Yuan's Rural Reconstruction Commission Formulates Agricultural Improvement Measures; Orders All Experimental Counties to Comply

Nanjing, 10th (Central News Agency dispatch) – As the autumn season is approaching, the Rural Reconstruction Implementation Committee of the Executive Yuan has formulated agricultural improvement measures for the autumn season and ordered all experimental counties to comply. The measures include:

"Article 1" Each experimental county's village service branch and village construction guidance team shall strengthen their organization and earnestly guide farmers to engage in: * Removal of impurities and inferior strains from rice crops; * Field selection of rice ears; * Removal of diseased rice plants; * Harvesting and processing of rice crops; * Digging out rice roots in fields affected by rice stem borers, and removal of autumn locusts, as well as destruction of their egg-laying grounds; * Production of compost; * Seed selection for wheat crops and hot water treatment of rice seeds; * Sowing of green manure crops; * Sowing and cultivation of autumn wheat, beans, and marketable edible crops; * Promotion of labor exchange, i.e., what is known in rural areas as exchanging labor and providing labor services; * Promotion of agricultural product manufacturing handicrafts; * Other agricultural improvement matters for the autumn season.

"Article 2" Each experimental county government should continue to urge farmers to make full use of wasteland, vacant land, and gaps between crops to plant buckwheat, potatoes, and other edible crops.

"Article 3" Those farmers who lack seeds, agricultural implements, and funds should be provided with remedies.

### Brinon's Testimony: Pétain Denies Allegations

Bailun, 10th (Central News Agency dispatch) – According to a Paris dispatch: Brinon, the former special envoy of the Vichy government in Paris, suddenly appeared in court yesterday during Pétain's trial and gave detailed testimony regarding Pétain's meeting with Hitler in the Montoire area in October 1940: "Marshal Pétain was very pleased with his talks with Hitler because Pétain sought peace with Germany. I personally respected Marshal Pétain very much, and I also strongly supported peace between France and Germany, hoping to avoid future wars. I and the personnel of the Vichy government at that time shared this feeling. As for the general public often attacking Marshal Pétain, saying that he played a 'double game,' this attack is unfounded and unreasonable; it is nothing but slander against Pétain. Pétain's return to Paris was actually to save the area's economic slump and maintain order. I have repeatedly told German personnel that Marshal Pétain is very willing to cooperate with Germany and advocates organizing French volunteer soldiers to fight against Bolshevism. In mid-December 1940, the German ambassador to Vichy, Abetz, presented Marshal Pétain with Hitler's invitation to attend the ceremony for the burial of Napoleon I's eldest son in Paris. Pétain had originally decided to attend, but he did not participate due to the dismissal of Laval." At this time, the jury asked Brinon, "Is it true that Pétain sent a congratulatory telegram to the Germans after the bombing of Dieppe in mid-August 1942?" Brinon replied, "Sending a congratulatory telegram to the Germans is indeed true, but I cannot say for sure whether Pétain personally signed the telegram. Pétain once said, 'France has gained nothing from Britain, but has benefited greatly from the United States, so I want to make the United States and Germany cooperate closely.' However, I know that Pétain deeply hated the measures taken against the Jews, but he could not do anything about it. Pétain at that time believed that Germany might win." After speaking, the hearing was temporarily suspended. When Brinon exited the courtroom, he bowed to Pétain, who denied Brinon's testimony.

Yesterday, the first defense witness was Admiral Auphan. He testified: "Marshal Pétain strongly supported Admiral Auphan, the chief naval advisor of the former Vichy government, in opposing the use of North African French forces against the Allied forces. Later, Auphan resigned because he was deeply afraid that Laval's policies would lead to war between France and Britain." The last defense witness was Du Nais (Economic Inspector of the Vichy Government). He said: "The report that Pétain sent a congratulatory telegram to the Germans after the bombing of Dieppe is purely unfounded."

### Household Flour Distribution to Continue Next Week; One Municipal Jin Per Person Starting Monday

The supply of essential goods for the livelihood of the people in this city has mostly been suspended. Only the household flour distribution continues without interruption. Although the quantity cannot satisfy everyone's needs, it still provides some small assistance to the people's food supply. It is learned that the Shanghai District Flour Unified Distribution Office has been ordered to continue the household flour distribution starting next Monday, with each person still receiving one municipal jin of second-grade flour. It is reported that the price of the flour for this distribution has been discussed several times by the Flour and Wheat Control Association, the Commercial Control Association, and the People's Food Adjustment Committee. They believe that the current purchase price of wheat has increased several times, and the cost of all manufactured products, labor, and transportation is enormous, increasing the cost. Therefore, it is necessary to increase the distribution price appropriately under the principle of rationality. It has been decided that the distribution price will be 2,500 yuan per municipal jin, and the Flour and Wheat Association will supervise the Flour Unified Distribution Office to distribute according to the new price.

### Air Defense Headquarters to Hold Charity Bazaar for Disaster Relief Next Week; Director Zhou of the Welfare Bureau Donates Items

### Welfare Bureau and Police Bureau to Suppress Taiping Gong Jiao; Severe Punishment for Those Who Extort Donations Under False Pretenses

It has been found that every year in this city, during the waste lunar Zhongyuan Gongjiao or the Hungry Ghost Festival, expenses for paper clothing, silver ingots, and noisy gongs and drums are levied on each household. During this time of wartime frugality, such practices of wasting money and manpower and engaging in superstitious worship are contrary to national policy. The Municipal Social Welfare Bureau, in view of this, has drafted measures to suppress Taiping Gongjiao and other activities and submitted them to the Municipal Government for approval and implementation. The regulations are excerpted below:

Measures of the Shanghai Special Municipal Social Welfare Bureau for Suppressing Taiping Gongjiao and Other Activities

The Shanghai Special Municipal Social Welfare Bureau has specially formulated these measures to adapt to the wartime system, promote frugality, and break down superstitions.

All superstitious activities held by citizens, such as Taiping Gongjiao or the Hungry Ghost Festival, are prohibited.

After the promulgation of these three measures, if citizens still hold Taiping Gongjiao or the Hungry Ghost Festival, the police bureau of each district will strictly suppress them.

If unscrupulous people collect donations from door to door under the name of Taiping Gongjiao, citizens may report them to this office or the local police bureau at any time. After verification by this bureau in conjunction with the local police bureau, if the report is found to be true (such as with donation books or receipts), a fine of up to 50,000 yuan may be imposed, and those with more serious circumstances will be dealt with according to law.

These measures will be implemented after approval by the Shanghai Special Municipal Government.

### Principal Xu Wanshan's Birthday Celebration Aids Charity

Madam Xu Wanshan, Principal of Qixiu Girls' School, is a distinguished figure from Lingnan. Her father, Xu Yuzhi, was a wise man of the late Qing Dynasty who managed the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company and initiated the General Chamber of Commerce. He also founded the Jinglun Shirt and Sock Factory, which added luster to the industrial world. Madam Xu inherited and surpassed her father's learning and talent. She has been chairman of the factory's board of directors for thirty years. Madam Xu has a chivalrous and generous nature, and her aspirations are matched by her actions. She remains celibate, dedicating herself to cultivating talent for the nation. The Shanghai Qixiu Girls' School is where Madam Xu has devoted her life's energy. For forty years, she has spread culture and education widely, nurturing countless talents. On the 18th of this month, Madam Xu will celebrate her 80th birthday. Her relatives and friends originally intended to hold a celebration, but Madam Xu firmly refused. Instead, the celebration was transformed into a gift of money, turning joy into practical use. Half of the money received will be used to establish the Wanshan Scholarship Fund, and half will be used to aid charitable endeavors in Shanghai, hoping to cultivate permanent talents for the nation and to live up to Madam Xu's lifelong ambition to develop education. All of Madam Xu's relatives, friends, and students will surely consider this undertaking to be a perfect fulfillment of her wishes.

### Personal Views on Improving Citywide Transportation

— Fang Youai

"Transportation is the nervous system of a city." It is a tool to connect the entire city. Of course, under the wartime system, it cannot be compared with the past, but within the scope permitted by the environment, we should strive to find ways to improve. Here are my humble opinions:

Unify the city's tram routes: Among urban transportation tools, none is better than the tram. Precisely because of the importance of its mission, it must be managed by the government. After the concessions were recovered, the old eight districts' trams and buses are still managed by the French Water and Electricity Company, which is an unreasonable phenomenon. Unifying the city's tram routes would not only bring great economic and time benefits to residents, but also increase national income.

Consider increasing tram routes and restoring trolleybuses: The closure of many trolleybus routes was originally a last resort due to power restrictions, but it has greatly affected the transportation of the general public. Therefore, within the possible scope, we still look forward to the authorities being able to consider restoring the original routes. For example, trolleybus route 18 has a great impact on residents of the central district. Although electricity is currently restricted, major entertainment venues have their own generators and are not affected by electricity restrictions at all, only for a small number of the bourgeoisie to spend. Under the same circumstances, the transportation problem that most residents need should not be absolutely without other remedies.

Improve vehicle congestion: The congestion of buses has become a common occurrence. In the carriages of general trams, there is usually a section where seats are removed. In terms of passenger capacity, it is undoubtedly expanding the space, which is precisely the most desirable advantage in the current crowded carriages. "Extending this analogy," why not unify the approach and carry out a thorough cleanup of the seats in the carriages, reducing the number of seats as much as possible without losing the balance of the vehicle. At the same time, the partition between the so-called first, second, and third classes (the former divisions of first, second, and third classes have now been abolished) could also be removed, so that the carriage capacity can be greatly increased.

Fare Issues: The repeated increase in fares is indeed stimulated by general commodity prices. However, the pricing of French trams has always been more than twice that of the old one district, indicating that it is not simply to cope with the general staff wage expenditure problem. However, the bottom line is to take back this public business. Other aspects, such as the uniform price of fares, are in line with the current frugality movement and can also train the general public to walk. However, for non-productive students and workers with low wages, fares should be vigorously suppressed.

Public carriages: I saw in the newspaper earlier that in order to adapt to the reduced tram service, preparations are being made to run public carriages. In essence, this is a move by the authorities to care about the citizens, but according to the current situation in Shanghai, this is a very difficult thing to please. May I ask how much capacity a carriage can have? How much power can a carriage have? And what about the value it requires? These are nothing more than tools for a few young masters to play and take a spin. It is still of no help to the general office salary class who need it every day. Therefore, we do not feel that there is a lack of rickshaws or tricycles. However, it may indirectly add another layer of threat to the coolie rickshaw pullers. Therefore, before public carriages are implemented, please reconsider whether these carriages can adapt to the current environment, because what we need is a public means of transportation for the masses.

Regarding Rickshaws and Tricycles: Tricycles are a fashionable product of the city, and rickshaws are a product with many years of history, but the popularity between the two is still surpassed by the later tricycles, but their prices are thousands of times more expensive than rickshaws. The reason for this is that it shows the畸形 development of Shanghai. The degradation of tricycle companies into tricycle wrecking cars is also a畸形 phenomenon.

Under the development of rickshaws and tricycles, adapting to the booming of military food stalls and vendors, to the point of clogging the streets and hindering transportation, are all things that are worth noting. At the same time, the authorities and various charitable organizations should not neglect the summer hygiene of the rickshaw pullers and the establishment of public tea stalls on the roadside.

Proposal for Rationing Bicycles: Bicycles were originally a common means of transportation, but after the war, with the soaring prices of everything, the price of the vehicle has also increased by "ten thousand" times, becoming aristocratic. As a result, ordinary people can only admire the price of the vehicle, but the car factories are not absolutely without cars, but because they are sold at a good price, they become rare goods, and small citizens have no way to enjoy them, while the general nouveau riche and the sons of the bourgeoisie use them as decorations. If they are tired of the old ones, they will change to new ones, and as a result, they become their exclusive items. There are exceptions, of course, but there are indeed many such situations.

Therefore, in this regard, it is hoped that the authorities will implement a "bicycle rationing" once, giving salaried employees, students, and civil servants more opportunities to have a permanent means of transportation. Indeed, this is a proposal that is an unwilling thing for a few car dealers, but it is a great grace for the general public, and under this wartime system, the authorities should strive to put it into practice as a premise.

Street Construction: The cityscape of Greater Shanghai after the war is eroding day by day. The streets are full of smoke, feces, and urine. The iron covers of copper and iron sewers and iron railings have been stolen. The asphalt roads are damaged, the air defense trenches have collapsed, the garbage is piled up, and even the sidewalks cannot be walked. The pedestrians are full of wounds and difficult to walk, especially at night. When it rains, it is even more slippery and difficult to step. The common people have nowhere to speak of their suffering. Among them, especially the improvement of road construction and air defense, it is hoped that the authorities can deal with it quickly.

Mr. Huang Huanqi wrote in a letter: "Our city has been repeatedly bombed, and the victims urgently need relief and treatment. I am heartbroken and cannot bear to sit idly by. I have specially donated four pounds of "Rodinia" anesthetic Cologne chloroform, 372 French local anesthetic needles, 54 German Three Arrows brand injection needles, and half a dozen German sterile sausage threads to the relief hospital, hoping that your newspaper will distribute them on my behalf. There is also a batch of 250 cc Chinese-made injection tubes, although they are broken, they are not essential and can still be used. If you don't mind the breakage, I will also offer them. In addition, I have attached a check for 500,000 yuan, which I would like you to donate 100,000 yuan each to scholarship funds, air raid relief funds, and midwifery funds, and 200,000 yuan to the Minhang Puji Sanatorium.
