Director-General Lin Delivers an Instruction

With this, he encouraged his comrades to complete the revolution, revive China, and defend East Xing. On the day of the preliminary review, the weather suddenly turned from rain to sunshine. Director-General Lin immediately pointed out that the previous period of rain indicated the difficulty of the current situation, which everyone should strive to overcome, while the subsequent sunshine indicated the brightness of the future, which everyone should strive to achieve. The rain in the sky is not snow water, but the blood of the Leader and the bitter tears of the people. Finally, Director-General Lin shouted loudly that revolutionary youth should shed blood, not tears, encouraging all youth to wipe away the tears in their eyes, unleash the blood in their bodies, that the enthusiasm of youth is the light of the nation, to defend the country and East Asia.

### Fierce Battles Erupt at the West Coast Main Hall of Okinawa Island, Japanese Special Attack Squads Sink Four Enemy Warships

Southwest Base, 4th (Central News Agency) - The battle situation on Okinawa Island on the 2nd is as follows: A considerably powerful enemy force attacked the east coast, but by 11:00 AM that morning, it was finally repelled by the brave Japanese army. In the Kochi-Maeda area, the enemy attacked with tanks, but was repeatedly and fiercely attacked by the Japanese army. As for the enemy forces on the west coast, they continued to bombard, and after noon, their artillery fire became even more intense, but the Japanese army secured its positions, which were unbreakable. On the 3rd, the enemy repeatedly attacked Kochi, but was repelled by the Japanese army each time. In its forward and intermediate positions, there were still powerful enemy forces with tanks repeatedly attacking, but the Japanese army secured its positions, causing heavy losses to the enemy. On this day, a part of the enemy forces on the west coast also attacked, and at around 2:00 PM in the afternoon, it mobilized another team to assist. The Japanese army bravely met the enemy and launched a fierce attack, and fierce battles are now underway.

Southwest Base, 4th (Central News Agency) - Japanese special attack squads and air units continue to attack enemy ships around Okinawa Island day and night. From the land base, the situation of friendly aircraft bravely attacking can be seen, making the officers and soldiers on the ground even more high-spirited. At dusk on the 3rd, a Japanese single attack broke through an enemy cruiser and sank its destroyer and minesweeper each, and also sank its cruiser on the sea off the north airfield. In addition, on the night of the 3rd, the Japanese Air Force fiercely attacked the two airfields in northern and central Okinawa Island, and more than a dozen fires broke out, lasting for a long time. In addition, on the 3rd, about 350 enemy aircraft, including several B29 types, bombed the entire line of the Ryukyu Islands.

Japanese Military and Civilians Donate Money to Build Aircraft

Tokyo, 4th (Central News Agency) - The decisive battle in Ryukyu is a major key to determining the survival of the Greater East Asia. Because the Japanese army, navy, and air force have displayed special attack magic, causing the enemy American army to suffer major setbacks and be extremely anxious, and the Japanese compatriots in Ryukyu, seeing the "divine" suicidal spirit, all shouted, "The special attack aircraft should continue to work hard and must not be interrupted." Because of their keen patriotism, recently all the officials of the Ryukyu Prefectural Government and all the staff of the secondary schools and national schools in the prefecture have donated all of their April salaries to the Ministry of the Army as funds for building aircraft. In addition, all the officers and soldiers of the entire Ryukyu force have also donated all their April salaries to the Ministry of the Army for the purpose of consolidating national defense.

American War Prospects Difficult

Guangzhou, 4th (Central News Agency) - A report from the United Press on the 30th described the scale and power of the Japanese special attack squads as follows: "Japanese special attack squads often form large teams to attack. For example, they continued to attack on the afternoon of the 28th. Although the American ships tried desperately to defend and fired fiercely, there was nothing they could do." According to a broadcast from Chongqing on the 30th, the Military Affairs Commission announced that the Japanese special attack aircraft teams in Ryukyu were making it impossible for the American army to do anything, and that such teams were likely to be inexhaustible. Therefore, the United States is facing very difficult prospects for the war against Japan, and the Chongqing army on the mainland plans to mobilize reinforcements to fight as soon as possible.

Lisbon, 3rd (Central News Agency) - According to a dispatch from Guam Base, the British battleship "George V" and the aircraft carrier "Illustrious" participated in the Pacific War, which has been announced by the British and American naval authorities. The US Pacific Fleet Command also announced on the 3rd that the latest British fast aircraft carriers "Indomitable", "Indefatigable", and "Victorious" (all 13,000 tons) recently assisted the US military in the Ryukyu campaign, attacking the Nansei Islands.

Editorial

### Where Are Chinese Youths Going?

No one can deny that the era we are in is an unprecedentedly significant era in human history. After this war, all corrupt elements and those who live in drunken stupor without striving for self-improvement will be eliminated by the torrent of the times; only those who are self-reliant and strive to improve and move forward will have days of exhaling and raising their eyebrows after experiencing hardships. However, looking back at our country, looking back at the current situation of the youth on whom our national destiny rests, we cannot help but feel disheartened!

Based on recent observations of the actual situation, there are three tendencies among youth in the peaceful areas: The first is to completely disregard reality, disregard the future of the world and the nation, and only know how to rely on the wealth and power of their parents and ancestors, living a life of drunken stupor, just as the "Enlightenment Scripture" says, "Although their bodies are present, their hearts are dead." The second is to only passively be dissatisfied with reality, expressing dissatisfaction, pessimism, and disappointment in everything, but without the ambition and ability to improve the status quo. They always stay out of things. The third attitude is more positive, but under the pressure of life, they have to scramble for a way to survive, so they run single errands, set up stalls, speculate, and earn extra money; their desire to make a living is not without sympathy, but as a result, they cannot take care of the country and society, and they are willing to forget righteousness in order to pursue profit; where great righteousness lies, they avoid it because it is contrary to their private interests. Of course, in addition to these three types of people, we can occasionally see struggling and promising youth, but they are rare and account for a very small number.

Secondly, what is even more heartbreaking is that recently many college students do not know how to study and prepare to be cadres for building a new China in the future, and there are even behaviors of self-degradation, such as flocking to group dances, etc. This newspaper has repeatedly received letters from readers, lamenting the absurd behaviors of most college students in Shanghai recently, which are emerging one after another. According to reports, the group dances of college students in this city started in the New Year of the current lunar calendar. Students from various universities held joint dance parties at the Lido Ballroom. The system of lottery tickets was imitated, and several female students sold happiness tickets, drawing prizes based on numbers, but the result was a huge income, with a considerable surplus in addition to the scheduled prizes. Since then, most college students have been skipping classes and abandoning their studies, and flocking to the so-called "party" of group dancing. At the same time, the declining dance industry in this city has also taken this as a new profit, and has been catering to the psychology of decadent youth, falsely calling it "college student dance party" and engaging in dirty money-making activities. If such actions to seduce young people are allowed, youth with weak will are very likely to become depraved, which is really a major crisis for society and the country!

At this time of turbulent situation, for the sake of the future of society and the country, we believe that concern for and guidance of youth is one of the most important tasks at present. The youth of our ally, Japan, have either joined the army and are fighting on the front lines to defend their country, or are participating in increased production work in the rear; they, regardless of gender, are unanimously working seriously. Most of the youth of both genders in the inland areas are also studying and working seriously. If the youth in the peaceful areas continue to live in drunken stupor and do not strive for self-improvement, the future of the country is really unimaginable! As for the general dissatisfaction of youth with the status quo, from another point of view, it is undoubtedly a gratifying phenomenon, but it is not enough to simply be dissatisfied with the status quo. At the same time, we must think about how to actively assist in improving the status quo, so that we can be worthy of being ambitious youth. Therefore, those in school must study, exercise their bodies, and those at work must work hard in their respective positions. Passive emotions of pessimism and despair are not attitudes that healthy youth should have!

However, the formation of the phenomenon of youth's depression and depravity is indeed attributable to the failure of social leaders to set an example and correct it in time. The words and deeds of social leaders can influence youth, so they must be models for youth; they should step forward for the benefit of the country, the nation, social welfare, not shrinking, not evading, not taking shortcuts for personal gain, so that the social atmosphere gradually changes. Premier Suzuki of our ally, at the advanced age of seventy, stepped forward in the autumn of national crisis, his youthful spirit is worthy of emulation by the people of the country. Today is Youth Day, may the youth rise up and strive for self-improvement, and everyone can display the vigor of youth, so that we can reform politics, transform the country, and realize the mission entrusted by the times!

### Japanese Army Fights Valiantly on Tarakan Island, Intense Bombardment on the Linkas Coast

A Certain Base, 4th (Central News Agency) - The enemy forces that landed on Tarakan Island mobilized powerful troops on the 3rd, assisted by tanks, to attack the Japanese defense line. The Japanese defense team lured the enemy forces to the front of the position and suddenly launched a fierce attack. The enemy forces could not hold on and fled to the coastal area, with about forty dead and wounded. The Japanese artillery team also responded and opened fire together, immediately sinking three small enemy ships.

Southwest Pacific Base, 4th (Central News Agency) - There were no major changes in the battle situation on Tarakan Island on the 3rd. The enemy forces were trying to strengthen their tank soldiers with landing craft, preparing to attack, but did not launch a real battle. The enemy ships approaching the Linkas coast were firing with naval guns, and the situation was very intense. The Japanese army opened fire from the land and immediately sank three minesweepers and destroyed another one. The rest disappeared, and it can be determined that they were attempting to land on the east coast. The Japanese army is now closely guarding the movements of the enemy forces. On the evening of the 2nd, the Japanese army stepped forward and entered the enemy's formation, disrupting its camp, killing and wounding many personnel, and destroying the enemy's offensive.

Landing on Tarakan Island Aims to Seize Oil

Southwest Pacific Base, 4th (Central News Agency) - The enemy's ambition to seize the oil resources of Borneo is becoming more and more obvious after they landed on Tarakan Island. At a time when the decisive battle in Ryukyu is fierce, the enemy actually dispatched large ships and soldiers and materials to forcibly land on Tarakan. There are several reasons for this: Even though the enemy forces have broken into the Japanese inner defense line, the B29-type bombers of the Mariana base have not been effective in bombing Japan proper, especially around Ryukyu Island, the losses of aircraft carriers and other ships can be described as the most tragic since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War. Therefore, the fuel used by ships and aircraft must not be sought from their own country, but must be sought from oil-producing areas adjacent to the war zone. The oil on Tarakan Island is of extremely good quality and can be used immediately. Not only can it hinder Japan's oil resources, but it can also increase the speed of operations in Shonan (i.e., Singapore). From this point of view, the enemy's ambitions cannot be ignored. However, the Japanese defense line is foolproof and fully prepared.

### Yan'an Holds National Congress

Lisbon, 4th (Central News Agency) - The Chinese Communist Party held its Seventh National Congress in Yan'an in late April, deciding to unite all the Chinese people to save the crisis caused by the erroneous policies of the Chongqing Kuomintang government and build the so-called free and democratic unified new China. The chairman of this conference was Mao Zedong, Zhu De, Zhou Enlai and other 15 people, and there were 544 official representatives, 208 alternate representatives, a total of 700 people, representing 1.2 million members of the Chinese Communist Party. The agenda of the conference was divided into four items: Mao Zedong's political report, Zhu De's military report, Liu Shaoqi's report on amending the party constitution, and the election of the Central Committee. In particular, Mao Zedong's political report is extremely noteworthy. The full text is about 60,000 words, and its main points discuss the so-called "coalition government," vehemently denying the so-called National Congress forged by the Chongqing regime, and advocating that all parties and factions should unite to form a coalition government. In this regard, the Chinese Communist Party's active theoretical struggle against the Chongqing Kuomintang has become more superficial, which is a phenomenon worthy of attention. The Yan'an regime held its first National Congress in January 1921, and this event was held 17 years after the first congress.

### Casual Talk of Hefei

— Xu Ming

Hefei is located in the central part of Anhui Province, between the Yangtze and Huai Rivers. To the north, it points to the Central Plains, and to the south, it connects with the capital. Since the Three Kingdoms period, whenever there were disturbances in the Jianghuai area, it has been a strategic location for military strategists. Moreover, it belongs to the rice-producing area of Anhui Province, so in years of favorable weather, its prosperity surpasses that of the Huainan region. I have been here for over a month, and what I have heard and seen is worth reporting to the people of Shanghai. Therefore, I specially record it for the readers.

The Land is Spiritually Endowed, Producing Outstanding People

Hefei is an ancient city, and also a place that "produces people." In the Romance of the Three Kingdoms, there is the chapter "Zhang Liao Startles Xiaoyao Ford." This Xiaoyao Ford is located within the city of Hefei, and there is also Cao Cao's military review platform, which is one of the famous historical sites. Legend has it that the famous selfless and impartial Judge Bao from history was a native of Hefei. The Bao Gong Ancestral Hall and Bao Family River outside the city are still available for later generations to commemorate. Li Hongzhang and Duan Qirui, who were influential figures in the late Qing Dynasty and early Republic of China, also had their ancestral homes here. As for high-ranking officials who received titles and favors from Qing Dynasty emperors, there are many tales as well. According to the people of Hefei, there are over two hundred division commanders of Hefei origin in the army, and the number of regimental and battalion commanders is countless. Wei Lihuang was also a native of Hefei. According to Feng Shui experts, Hefei is surrounded by mountains in the north and embraces Chaohu Lake in the south, and the soil is rich and fertile, so it is "spiritually endowed," and therefore produces many "outstanding people." Local people all pass down poetry and books within their families. The Spring Festival couplets on the doors of every household in the city, judging from the exquisite calligraphy, are enough to show that Hefei is a city of scholars.

Transportation and Market Conditions

Since the Huainan Railway was rerouted last year, this area, being within the dismantled railway zone, can no longer be directly reached by train. There are currently two transportation lines:

(1) The "Central China Transportation" trucks from Hefei to Shuijiahu. From Shuijiahu to Bengbu, there are trains for unloading and transfer, leading to the Southern Line.

(2) Small steamboats from Hefei through Chaoxian County to Yuxikou. From Yuxi, crossing the Yangtze River leads to Wuhu.

Comparing the two lines, the first line is safer. However, the fares are both expensive. Before the dismantling of the railway, the Hefei market had already shown little improvement. After the dismantling of the railway, it has declined even further. Although food prices are cheap, it is difficult to earn money. While other regions had bumper harvests last year, Hefei suffered from severe drought, resulting in an even greater impact. If transportation remains inconvenient in the future, there is no hope for improvement in market conditions. The price of rice is 56,000 per dan (approximately 50 kg), large dou (unit of measurement), flour is 400 per jin (approximately 500 g), and pork is 550 per jin. Three eggs cost 100 yuan.

Opium Tables

Local opium is sold publicly, and because the profits are high, few farmers do not grow it. Although the government has repeatedly issued orders, the words are earnest, but the listeners are indifferent, and little has been achieved. Moreover, it is related to local finances, making reform difficult. The main trading place for opium is outside the East Gate of the city. Square tables are used as markers, with opium placed on top for buying and selling, conducted openly. The equipment is simple and the procedures are convenient. Local people call it "opium tables," which can be compared with the "rat cages" of Bengbu. Because opium is produced, there are also many addicts, and it is worrying what the future holds if this continues.

A Glimpse of Famine

In places that rely on agriculture, people depend on the weather. Hefei suffered from severe drought last year, and before the wheat harvest this year, people were living in famine. Most of the residents in the city are engaged in industry and commerce, landlords, and soldiers, so they can still cope with life. However, rural farmers have no harvest, and taxes are heavy. Unwilling to abandon the fields that have been cultivated for generations, they live in extreme poverty. After the busy farming season, most young and strong people go out to flee the famine. Those who remain at home, lacking money to buy rice, subsist on wheat paste, small garlic, sweet potato leaves, and wild vegetables. I have never seen farmers in the countryside eat rice. However, in order to cope with the pressure to pay rice and grass taxes, villagers have to borrow money to buy rice and grass to barely survive. Their plight is truly beyond words. As for the prevalence of opium, gambling, and usury in rural towns, it is no different from the rural areas of Jiangsu and Zhejiang.

People's Burden

Taking a township with an area of 15 square li (approximately 7.5 km) and a population of over 10,000 as a unit, the people's monthly burden includes the following:

Food rice: 220 dan.

Burning grass: 600 dan.

Cash: 5,500,000.

Labor: 20,000 workdays. On average, each able-bodied man in each household works fifteen days a month without meals provided.

Other temporary building materials, such as earth bricks and wood, are requisitioned as needed without a fixed schedule. As for taxes, they are not yet included. In short, there are numerous organizations, and even the army is said to have three kinds in the Republic of China. The heavy burden on the people is imaginable.

Hefei has its glorious past, and it is an important town in Huainan, but due to frequent disturbances and transportation obstacles, it has gradually declined. How to revive it is the responsibility of the people of Hefei and the authorities. (Relocation to Support Education)

### Allied Forces of Britain, America, and Soviet Union Continue to Meet in Multiple Locations; British Forces Approach Danish Border

Central News Agency, Stockholm, 4th — According to recent news arriving here, British forces have occupied Hamburg, Germany's second largest city, and the British, American, and Soviet forces have met in multiple locations within Germany. Therefore, the European war is nearing its end. According to news from the anti-Axis forces in Rome, the German and Italian troops in northern Italy and western Austria, commanded by General Vieuillez, have surrendered to the anti-Axis forces. Therefore, the Italian war, which lasted for two and a half years, ended on Wednesday. According to Alexander's latest announcement, the fighting west of the Isonzo River in northern Italy has ceased. According to news from Berlin, the German corridor in the north has been closed, and the remaining German territory in the south is only a small triangular area of 3,200 square kilometers, less than 1% of Germany's total territory. After the British and Soviet forces met in Wismar yesterday morning, they met again in the Grabow area. At the same time, the American Ninth Army met with Soviet forces in three locations near Wittenberg. The Soviet advance westward has driven a large number of Germans into the hands of Montgomery's troops.

Do your utmost to supply food, electricity, gas, and wood, regardless of whether the enemy allows us to advance the above tasks. We can only do our best to maintain the survival of the German people.

### Soviet Union Accuses Britain and the United States of Violating Prisoner of War Agreement; U.S. State Department Issues Rebuttal Statement

Central News Agency, Stockholm, 4th — According to Moscow Radio, the Director of the Soviet Prisoner of War Exchange Committee issued a statement criticizing Britain and the United States for violating the Crimean Conference decision on the treatment and exchange of prisoners of war. The main points are as follows: Britain and the United States are now failing to implement the Yalta decision on the treatment and exchange of prisoners of war among the three countries, Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union. On the contrary, they are taking opposing actions. For example, there are currently eight hundred Soviet military officers and prisoners of war in the United States, but the United States has not notified the Soviet Union of the location of these prisoners. Furthermore, there are currently three prisoner of war camps in the United Kingdom that house Red Army prisoners.

The reasons are as follows: Among the prisoners of war sent to the United States during the initial fighting in France, approximately 4,300 were identified as Soviet citizens and were quickly returned to their home country. As the fighting progressed, the U.S. military released Soviet citizens who had been captured or exploited by the German military. In the United States, there are 118 prisoners who appear to be Soviet citizens, but because they were wearing German uniforms and taking hostile actions against the U.S. military, they were treated as German prisoners of war.

### Strengthening Guild Organizations, Dredging Sources of Goods, Director Xu of the Economic Bureau Talks About the General Situation of Administration

The 15th press conference hosted by the Propaganda Office of the Shanghai Special Municipality was held at 10:30 a.m. on the 4th in the city government conference room. Director Xu Jiang of the Municipal Economic Bureau was specially invited to attend and answer questions raised by various newspapers. The details are as follows:

Suppressing Prices

(Question) Recently, the price of goods in Shanghai has been rising endlessly, which has greatly affected the livelihood and public security. The bureau has twice suppressed the price of goods, determining new price limits, but the actual number of businesses that comply with the price limits is still small. Does the bureau have any concrete measures to thoroughly suppress prices? (Answer) The bureau's handling of commodity registration and cracking down on hoarding is the basic work to suppress prices. Personnel are sent to secretly investigate stores that exceed the price limit and are punished accordingly, and letters are sent to the police bureau for assistance. As for concrete measures to thoroughly suppress prices, we are actively dredging the sources of goods.

(Question) Recently, due to the increase in prices of public utilities, the prices of various commodities have also risen crazily. What are the countermeasures? (Answer) The bureau is investigating the rise in prices of various commodities following the increase in prices of public utilities.

Reorganizing Guilds

(Question) Regarding strengthening the organizational structure of various industry guilds, what is the current progress of the guilds that should be reorganized or merged? (Answer) The work of reorganizing industry guilds can be completed recently. However, strengthening the organizational structure is complicated. A detailed announcement will be made after the entire plan is finalized.

Commodity Registration

(Question) After the registration of major commodities began on April 16th, it is said that many businesses are not enthusiastic about complying with the registration. If registration is not completed by the deadline, what measures are planned? (Answer) All methods and procedures for registering major commodities have been disclosed in the newspapers. The bureau has strictly urged various industry guilds to notify their members to register on schedule to avoid penalties for overdue registration.

Thoroughly Investigating Securities Exchanges

(Question) Recently, regarding the drastic changes in Shanghai's financial situation, the bureau director and the China Reserve Bank's Inspection Office and the Ministry of Finance's Securities Exchange Supervisor thoroughly investigated the account books of securities firms. Can you tell us about the process? (Answer) The content of the ordered investigation of securities exchanges is roughly divided into two key points: (A) Stopping convenient transactions, (B) Strictly prohibiting over-the-counter transactions.

(Question) What are your feelings about the soaring and plummeting of stocks and gold? (Answer) The soaring of stocks and gold is due to speculation by floating capital, but both soaring and plummeting are manageable. The government is closely watching to make the ups and downs rational.

Recent Administration

(Question) What is the recent administration of the Economic Bureau? Are there any new plans to improve the current chaotic economic situation? (Answer) The bureau has no new plans in terms of recent administration. We are currently: 1. Strengthening guilds, 2. Trying to dredge the sources of goods. If the above two items can be carried out smoothly, it will be beneficial to the current chaotic economic situation. Otherwise, it will be difficult to implement even if there are new plans.

Cooking Oil Prices

(Question) After the announcement of the selling price of cooking oil in the city, it was possible to buy it sporadically at first, but now all cooking oil retailers have no goods on the market, and the price of cooking oil on the black market has skyrocketed, causing hardship to the people. What appropriate measures does the Economic Bureau have to deal with this? (Answer) Cooking oil is subject to control. We are consulting with the Oil Control Association to adjust the methods.

How are the controlled materials handled after they are confiscated, and what is the total amount? (Answer) No cases of confiscation of controlled materials have occurred during my tenure.

### Various Control Associations Strengthen Purchasing Work; Purchased Materials are in Transit

Various control associations under the Commerce Control Association have expanded the amount of funds for purchasing controlled materials this year in accordance with needs and increased agricultural production. It is understood that most of the funds that each control agency has borrowed from the Central Reserve Bank and the Shanghai Banking Syndicate have been used up for purchases. Recently, the prices of goods in the three provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui and the two cities of Nanjing and Shanghai have varied greatly, and transportation in various places is not smooth. People from all walks of life believe that the purchasing work of various control associations will be affected. However, according to many sources, the price issue of agricultural products has been determined by various control associations long ago and will be carried out sequentially, which will not fundamentally affect the budget. Furthermore, transportation is actively promoted everywhere, and purchasing is strengthened everywhere. Materials such as cotton, rice, flour, and oil crops have been collected in warehouses and offices in various production areas, and either have been shipped to Shanghai in batches or are in transit.

### The Police Bureau Held a Bureau Affairs Meeting Yesterday

### Director Dai of the Education Bureau Inspects Municipal Schools

### Shanghai Business Directory Already Published; Subscribers Pick Up Books with Vouchers

The "Shanghai Business Directory," compiled and printed by this newspaper, experienced several interruptions in printing due to repeated electricity restrictions. However, through various efforts, it has now been printed and bound into a thick volume. The book contains over 20,000 prominent industrial and commercial establishments in the city, along with various appendices and the most recent detailed Shanghai city maps. It is considered an essential reference tool for the business community. It has now been published, and previously subscribed users can pick up their books at the newspaper's circulation department, starting immediately, by presenting their order forms. Due to the doubled cost of paper and labor, after careful consideration, the price of the book has been revised to 8,000 yuan. The number of copies printed is limited, so those who wish to purchase should do so quickly.

### University Student Crime Prevention Committee Asks Students to Cease Tea Dances

The Shanghai Special Municipality University Student Crime Prevention Research Committee, noting that university students often hold "parties" with social tea dances in dance halls and other venues, where male and female students dance wildly, deems this highly inappropriate. It has been verified that the New Citizen Movement youth and students previously strongly advocated for the strict prohibition of opium, gambling, and dancing as part of the anti-three vices movement, even destroying gambling tables and dance halls. Holding social tea dances now is completely contrary to the principles of the New Citizen Movement and hinders academic pursuits. Therefore, it has been approved by the Municipal Education Bureau and the Municipal Police Bureau's Crime Prevention Section to prohibit these activities. The authorities have accepted this proposal and will implement a ban to rectify the academic atmosphere.

### Hope Public Utilities Will Not Raise Prices Again in the Future

Since May 1st, the prices of trams, telegrams, postage, etc., have been re-adjusted, with considerable increases. Public utilities are intended to serve society and are fundamentally different from other profit-seeking entities. This price adjustment is indeed a necessary measure, but the impact on people's livelihoods is undeniable. It is hoped that after this price adjustment, prices will not be raised again within a possible range. It is also hoped that the relevant authorities will consider the burden on ordinary people when reviewing, which would be fortunate. (Liu Zhizhi)

### Going to Okinawa with a Smile

— Special Attack Squads are "Living Bombs" — Roundtable Discussion with Three Special Correspondents from Land and Naval Aviation Bases

Watanabe: I've been to Army Base A, the front line in southern Kyushu. Because it is nearest Okinawa Island, special attack aircraft going there are just as if at the battlefield. The enemy's small aircraft, or short-range aircraft from Iwo Jima, often strike unexpectedly, and the situation is very tense. The tense and excited staff and command post personnel have not slept peacefully once since the American enemy landed on Okinawa Island, often dozing off at their desks. As a result, they have completely lost their appetite, eating only a bite or two of food before losing interest. As soon as they hear that a special attack plane has arrived, even the special attack members who are eating immediately put down their chopsticks and want to go to war. Whether special attack members or guards, everyone at the base is united, prepared to ram their bodies into enemy aircraft carriers. This base has become a huge cannon, continuously firing special attack "living bombs" at Okinawa every day.

Okayudera: Honestly, the fighting spirit at the base is truly earth-shattering. People who are not at the base cannot imagine the spirit there. Anyone who has seen the power of the base will naturally have a strong desire to increase aircraft production. Everyone believes that as long as there are planes, we will win.

Mimuro: In short, the main battlefield of the Pacific decisive battle has shifted to Okinawa. In terms of timing, it has entered a critical moment. "A single misstep leads to eternal regret" is an appropriate description of the situation here. Everyone feels this keenly. Therefore, the tension at the base is incredible. Rather than saying that people generally yearn for aircraft reinforcements, everyone is filled with a spirit of shared hatred against the enemy. Materials are continuously transported to Okinawa. Our base has been launching attacks almost every day since the first attack on April 6th. One day, special attack squads advancing to our base did not even have time to drink tea before attacking to kill the enemy. At the same time, due to weather conditions, they ran around the base all night. Seeing this situation, no one was not moved. From this, one can see the situation of the battle of Okinawa Island.

Courageous Spirit

Okayudera: The more attacks by the first, second, and third special attack squads, the more difficult it becomes. Now is the most difficult time. Because the enemy was initially caught off guard and stunned by the ramming of Japanese special attack aircraft. Naturally, this was because it was the first time the enemy's army and navy aviation units had encountered this special attack method. The enemy's defensive fire, which is trying to prevent special attack planes from ramming them, has become increasingly fierce. The enemy is equipping more and more escort fighters with highly sensitive radar detectors. They are afraid of night air raids and are releasing a large number of night fighters at all costs. The enemy, which is truly worthy of its reputation for abundant materials, now has excellent night fighters. When special attack teams are mentioned, some people may mistakenly believe that all they need to do is take a bomb or torpedo and ram it into an enemy ship, but the reality is not so simple. It must be understood that the more important the mission of the special attack squad, the greater the difficulty.

Also, some people in our Japanese air force believe that the enemy's American ships invading Okinawa Island number more than 1,400, but according to the results announced by the Japanese headquarters, only half have been eliminated, which has led to some feeling discouraged and disheartened. But the actual results are much greater than the published figures.

The results announced by the headquarters are only the maximum results acknowledged by the escorting comrades. In recent days, the results obtained by special attack planes without direct escort protection cannot be verified because all aircraft have rammed into their targets and have not returned, so there is no way to know. Some people must believe that the purpose of the direct escort aircraft accompanying the sortie is to judge the results so as to inform the people, but as far as special attack units are concerned, the results are not the main issue. They only know how to complete the ramming mission. The so-called direct protection cannot be judged by its name alone as simply being in charge of protection, but when necessary, it can only be ramming. Now there is no question of escort aircraft. When there are many aircraft, there are certainly escort aircraft, but now there is no need for such extravagance and waste to bring escort aircraft. The special attack aircraft only knows how to ram enemy ships. It is a bit uneconomical for one aircraft to ram one warship. Lieutenant S of a certain base said that one aircraft often destroyed a cruiser and a destroyer. Lieutenant S said with boiling killing intent:

"We cannot die unless we completely destroy enemy ships. Let's call this tactic the Special Attack Method!"

Mimuro: At the moment before the attack, the squad members stand in front of their aircraft, holding round rice balls in their hands and saying, "Let's eat them on the battlefield!" Another person does not laugh and says, "Let's eat them here! Because we can only arrive at the battlefield at noon, let's eat and then go:" The meal has neither wine nor dishes. There's no talk of a feast. They feel as if they are going on a picnic to the nearby seaside.

It is truly impossible to explain to those who are not there. They go to the battlefield and exchange their lives for results. Even an hour or two before ramming and sacrificing themselves, they are still calm and composed. A team leader handed his beloved knife to the maintenance chief, leaving a few words saying, "Now is when I use my life to ram the enemy, so this knife is not needed." He also said that writing a will or not writing a will is the same anyway. Finally, this soldier of the "no good" youth took off without leaving a single word.

Watanabe: Sometimes I ran to the squad members to inquire about their feelings before the attack. One very young pilot frankly replied in a low voice, "I don't think about anything." This can truly be said to regard death as a return. I felt very ashamed, why did I ask such a stupid question?

Air and Land United

Okayudera: In addition, at the base, the air and land forces can be said to be completely united, without any disagreements. The pilots who have harvested such brilliant results naturally need to share some of the credit with the maintenance personnel who continue to work tirelessly day and night. At the same time, Japan does not have enough aircraft, but it has been able to make the most of the current number of aircraft, which is naturally due to the merit of the land maintenance personnel. The maintenance personnel work hard and sweat profusely before sending off the special attack team on its sortie, which can only inspire admiration.

Because no one works when they sleep at night, they immediately jump up to work when they hear the order to service the aircraft. When enemy aircraft come, they drag the aircraft to a safe area, that is, drag it from the airport to a distant hiding place. Because the maintenance personnel are overworked day and night, their hands, faces, and entire bodies are covered in sweat, dirt, and skin mixed together, completely turning black.

Recently, because night attacks and dawn attacks have increased, there is no time to sleep, and the night maintenance work has especially increased. During enemy air raids at night, the working hours are further extended because no lights can be turned on. Maintenance materials are also not wasted because they are on the front line. If there is an order for a special attack unit to sortie tomorrow morning, the maintenance soldiers that night will definitely not be able to sleep. The drivers pity them and share their food with the maintenance personnel to temporarily fill them up for the night, but the maintenance personnel refuse, saying, "The people who are going on the expedition should eat this meal." The maintenance soldiers still endure hunger and work busily in the dark corners of the airport. The maintenance personnel are truly admirable.

Watanabe: The mission of the escort fighters, which specialize in protecting the brave special attack squads who selflessly ram enemy ships, is to protect the special attack squads safely to their target battlefield, day and night. The hard work and merit of the escorts should also not be ignored. They take off to greet them when the special attack planes arrive, and they stand guard when they attack. These tireless escort members have moustaches on their faces and bright lights in their eyes.

Value Aircraft

Okayudera: Old airmen who have worked for four years are still working at the base, which proves the strength of the Japanese Air Force. The enemy may have a large number of aircraft, but they do not have drivers, so they gather students to implement short-term training, and sometimes even conscript people from the county. Compared with us in Japan, the enemy is truly not good in terms of talent. But Japan has such excellent drivers who are the pride of the world, and it is not possible to make all of them special attack members at once. The fact is that many people feel sorry that they have not become special attack members and have to become ordinary pilots. The base commander and flight commander often painstakingly console these ordinary pilots, knowing my difficulties. I already knew you wanted to ram, you didn't have to say it. But today I can only send out 0 aircraft. If I send you, wouldn't other people have to stay behind as well. Don't you think?"

The commander and flight commander repeat these words to the squad members every day with painstaking care.

Watanabe: Our base is like that too. A batch of aircraft are transported in, and at the same time, the team members who arrive at the base will be ordered to give the aircraft to others if they are not careful and the aircraft malfunctions. This is the most painful moment for him.

"There is nothing more painful than this, so I often don't land and fly straight to the battlefield."

This is what the driver who was left behind said, with tears in his eyes. The team members who received the aircraft waved the blooming cherry blossoms and branches sent by the nearby female students and bravely from the base where and left to the expedition, and flew to the expedition. The team members who were left behind at the base, when the weather was bad, thought that the aircraft could not reach its destination, so they ran to the airfield and looked up at the sky, waiting for their comrades who had gone on the expedition to return. This situation is exactly like a relay race, anxiously waiting for the person who ran first. The team members who flew back because of aircraft malfunctions had the maintenance soldiers take care of them, but they always did not leave the aircraft, constantly asking, "Is it not done yet?" When it was announced that the aircraft could not be used due to insufficient maintenance soldiers, this team member seemed to have lost consciousness.

Mimuro: This is very true. Whenever we went on an expedition at our base, when we encountered this kind of situation, it was the same as what happened at your base. Therefore, the people at the base love aircraft more than the people in the rear. On the eve of the first big offensive, in the dormitory of the special attack team, everyone was surrounding the staff to talk about the attack tactics for tomorrow. After the tactics were decided, the team leaders immediately conveyed them to their respective special attack team members. The final order was "Don't be impatient and waste the aircraft!" Another sentence was "If the conditions for is not good, fly back safely!" This seems to be another form of motherly love, but in reality it refers to the aircraft. Because the special attack team's creed is "Every aircraft must be taken good care of!" It is using life as a bomb to rush towards the enemy, and it would be a loss to the base to waste this precious living bomb. The maintenance chief also had something to say, "We are responsible for the aircraft malfunctioning." Therefore, if an aircraft malfunctions, they must work all night and mobilize everyone to fix it properly.

Because the maintenance work is too tense, there are often several people every night who immediately jump up when they dream of doing maintenance and repair work. (Translated from Asahi Shimbun, April 18)

### Female Mechanics Active at Northern Bases

Two new aircraft carrying huge bombs roared into life, and from the base, they flew toward the northern sea, setting out to search for the enemy's tracks. The female mechanics who had carefully maintained the planes, looked up and fixed their gaze, waving goodbye to the beloved aircraft that disappeared in the skies beyond.

The war situation in the north has also become urgent. Now, enemy air raids on Japan's northeastern islands have become more intense day by day. The female mechanics, with their uniquely feminine intuition, had long felt the tension and urgency of the atmosphere at the base.

Determined to Serve the Country Early On

"You are maintenance soldiers serving on the front lines. The aircraft that you repair and maintain participate directly in combat. If they are hit by bullets or suffer serious damage and return, you should immediately start repairing them. The reason why we are implementing strict military education for you is to cultivate your ability to cope with emergencies," said the unit commander.

In fact, they had long since made up their minds. The heroism of Lieutenant Junior Grade Jiro Yokozaki and Ensign Iwao Narikiyo, who had rammed into enemy aircraft over the northern Kuril Islands and died for their country, was from this base. With tears in their eyes, they bid farewell to the brave soldiers who would never return, and made up their minds that even if their noses were frozen off and their hands and feet were injured, they would work hard. Just as the unit commander said, they were all "maintenance special attack soldiers," and they would faithfully complete their assigned tasks.

Excellent Work and Enthusiasm

This unit began employing female mechanics three years ago, and to date, there are 00 members. Wearing combat caps with star badges and dressed in uniform, they were a formidable women's army. The members who joined the unit as a "volunteer corps" last December have now become excellent mechanics. The quality of their work has impressed even the instructors. The new aircraft that they have repaired and maintained are now active on the front lines in the northeast.

The fact that they have been able to achieve such astonishing results in a short period of time is largely due to their enthusiasm. In addition, it is also due to the unit commander's appropriate education. That is, in the "always on the front line" atmosphere, they implement military education, while at the same time teaching thorough basic technical education.

"Working in the military is different from manufacturing aircraft in a factory. Now that you have joined the army, even if you are women, you should be excellent soldiers. This is what I often tell them. In the first week after they join the unit, I teach them to stand at attention, salute, pay attention , quick march, and practice in close order drill, so that they can experience the taste of the military and understand the spirit of soldiers in military training. The biggest flaw of women is being and I also try to correct it, so that they develop the of military personnel. After they have understood the true spirit of soldiers, I begin to teach them basic technical skills. They are very enthusiastic, but basic technical skills are very important. Even a small nail, if it is not nailed correctly, can cause the aircraft to disintegrate in the air. No matter how small the point, if it is not , it will affect the performance of the aircraft. Therefore, within a month of joining the unit, I fully teach them the basic technical knowledge, from the flight principle of the aircraft to the structure, performance, and handling methods of the aircraft, and even a small pipe, must be explained for its function through lectures and objects. The result of this thorough education is that it has achieved results beyond expectations."

As the unit commander said, amidst the deafening roar of engines, the members wearing oil-stained uniforms and short, disheveled hair are concentrating all their attention on repairing and assembling important parts of the ship, such as steel plates, gears, elevators, and rudders. In less than four months since joining the unit, they have learned the basic techniques, and the of their work is no less than that of men.

Using Holidays to Tour and Sing

In order to cultivate their spirit of not being afraid of any difficulties and their "always on the battlefield" mentality, in addition to the twice-monthly exercises, every Wednesday is designated as Kendo Day to encourage the team members to practice martial arts. Recently, in order to improve work efficiency and provide proper entertainment, a harmonica band has been formed under the leadership of the unit commander. At the same time, a choir has also been organized, and on holidays, they tour the various workplaces, singing songs such as "Army," " and "Aviation Japan," and "Patriotic Flower," adding infinite vitality to this strictly disciplined base. The soldiers are all eagerly awaiting the arrival of this harmonica choir.

Normally, from 7:30 am to 5:00 pm, excluding 15-minute breaks in the morning and afternoon, they are working non-stop. They do not feel tired at all, and even the two days off each month are willingly given up, because they want to use their own hands to protect the aircraft that defend the northern sky of the motherland.

### On School Air Defense Work

— Jiang Yu

Under the active advocacy of the authorities, our city's air defense work has made considerable progress, such as traffic control, emergency evacuation drills, blackout measures, widespread construction of street air raid shelters, and the organization of fire brigades in various Baojia districts. However, internal air defense work within schools, vocational institutions, government agencies, factories, organizations, and neighborhood committees has yet to be effectively implemented. As a result, many chaotic phenomena still occur during air raids, such as people gathering on rooftops to watch, disregarding traffic control regulations, and carelessly leaking lights. As I serve at a school, I have personally witnessed the disorderly flight of our students during enemy bombing raids, with many female students crying and screaming. This shows that citizens still lack basic air defense knowledge. To enable all citizens to calmly deal with future indiscriminate bombing by enemy aircraft, I humbly believe that various agencies, schools, and neighborhood committees should rapidly construct various air defense facilities and universally implement citizen air defense training, with the latter being a particularly urgent task.

Currently, Shanghai has approximately two hundred middle and high schools, and elementary schools are even more numerous. Shutting down these schools due to frequent bombings would be an undesirable solution. The central task for school authorities should be to adapt education to the future wartime environment. I would like to offer my humble suggestions on school air defense work:

(A) Each school should establish an air defense guidance organization to plan all air defense matters for the school, with the following as priorities:

Constructing one or more safe air raid shelters on or near the school grounds capable of accommodating all staff and students.

Offering training courses on basic air defense and first aid knowledge.

Intensifying emergency evacuation drills for the entire school.

Organizing air defense and first aid teams and discipline squads.

Collecting emergency medical supplies, equipment, etc.

(B) The person in charge of the school's air defense organization should be the principal or a representative of the principal, with the participation of teachers and student representatives to ensure unified action throughout the school.

(C) To ensure the smooth progress of work, the following measures may be adopted: Invite personnel from the city's air defense headquarters to come to the school for guidance; establish close contact with the air defense organizations of the Baojia district where the school is located to exchange experiences and cooperate; and cooperate with nearby agencies and residents.

Funding for air defense can be raised through donations, etc., but all accounts must be absolutely transparent to prevent corruption.

However, the true effectiveness of air defense work lies in daily guidance and training, ensuring that all students acquire basic air defense knowledge and training in a short period. On the other hand, students should not abandon their studies under the pretext of the danger of air raids but should actively participate in various air defense services at the school and in the district (such as digging air raid shelters, rescue teams, discipline squads, stretcher teams, etc.). In this way, not only can damage from enemy bombing be reduced, but also studies can continue uninterrupted.

Young students are the backbone of society and should promote the spirit of empathy, encouraging all citizens to actively participate in air defense training.

Finally, I sincerely hope that the responsible authorities of the city's air defense headquarters and the currently established wartime temporary refugee relief committee will promptly pay attention to and plan more in-depth air defense work throughout the city to cope with the increasingly frequent and serious air raids.

### Traffic Problems Between the Western District and the North Station in This City  Shen Xiliang

The newspaper reported on the 23rd of last month: "The Construction Bureau of this city is concerned about the frequent traffic near the North Station, especially the congestion of vehicles going to and from the station. The original roads are not wide enough, causing considerable inconvenience to travelers. Therefore, there is talk of opening a trunk road directly to the North Station from the northern and southern districts." I will briefly describe what I have observed:

1.  Traditionally, access to the North Station has been via North Zhejiang Road or North Henan Road. These two roads are very narrow and located in the central area, causing considerable inconvenience due to traffic congestion. In the past, trolleys No. 18 and No. 14 could directly reach the North Station, but they are now out of service, relying entirely on rickshaws and tricycles, which makes it even more inconvenient. The Suzhou River meanders from the corner of the sack, forming a river bend, so the roads along the river, such as Xinza Road and Beijing Road, also meander. Citizens living in the western districts of Shanghai who want to go to the North Station must go via Xinza Road and Beijing Road and turn into the North Station via Zhejiang Road, which is a long way around. In accordance with what is called the shortest straight line between two points in geometry, I propose that if a bridge can be built over the Suzhou River at the end of Route Robert and a trunk road can be opened through the Guangzhao Villa, connecting with Guangzhao Road, passing through Datong Road and Xinmin Road, and going directly to the North Station, this road, while not directly connected, is nearly a straight line. The cost is only to build a bridge and open a small section of road! It provides a great deal of convenience to the citizens of the Western District, as they can go to the North Station without going through Zhejiang Road or Henan Road. The congestion on the two roads mentioned above can be reduced, so the opening of this road has great value.

2.  If the construction of this bridge is too expensive, there is an even simpler solution: to use the original Maigen Road Bridge at the end of Card Road (currently impassable), repair it slightly, and then go directly to the North Station via Hengfeng Road through the road and Xinmin Road, which is also very convenient.

I am presenting the above two points for the reference of the Board of Supervisors. If one of them is realized, it will bring great convenience to the citizens of the Western District.

### Vocational Guidance Office of the Social Welfare Bureau

— Jia Xi

Shanghai's industry and commerce in recent years has shifted from abnormally prosperous to depressed. At the end of the lunar year last year, government agencies and industrial and commercial circles generally experienced layoffs. The widespread stagnation and contraction of industry and commerce has led to an increasing number of unemployed people. No matter how good their academic skills are or how high their service morals are, they still cannot find a job. In small terms, it is a factor of social unrest, Ninghe, and chaos; in large terms, it is a loss to the entire country, so this issue cannot be ignored.

It seems that the general public has not paid attention to this issue. In such a large city as Shanghai, with so many unemployed people, there is only one vocational guidance office attached to the Social Welfare Bureau to deal with this issue. The reporter visited Mr. Yang Chongzhen, the director of the office, who told him in detail about the office's work in introducing occupations. However, what is surprising is that although the number of unemployed people is increasing day by day, not many people are actively seeking jobs at the vocational introduction office (see the detailed numbers below). According to Mr. Yang, the reasons are nothing more than the following:

The office is located in the western corner (the address is No. 200 Yongan Road, formerly Route Remy), and is not widely known to the general public.

The unemployed know that layoffs are a common phenomenon, and even if they register, they may not have much hope.

Most of the unemployed who have recently been laid off can receive a lump sum severance payment or retirement bonus. Some take this opportunity to return to their hometown, and some use it to invest or operate a small business.

The unemployed feel that salaried people can never maintain their lives, so even if they are dismissed, they no longer seek employment and would rather work alone or set up a stall, which may be more profitable.

For specialized technical talents who register at the vocational introduction office, the office will do its best to introduce them to relevant industrial and commercial institutions, or send personnel to visit them and make oral recommendations. However, only 3% or 4% of them can succeed. On the one hand, there is no temporary need for talents in construction, civil engineering, and machinery during the war period. On the other hand, it is also because these talents are not easy-going or condescending, so the introduction of these talents is particularly unsuccessful.

The number of job seekers, the number of employers, and the number of introductions in the past two months are recorded below.

February Male Female Total
Job seekers 644 160 804
Employers 97 37 134
Introduced 40 20 60

March Job seekers 390 138 528
Employers 47 22 69
Introduced 30 14 44

The talents sought by the vocational guidance office are mostly trainees, laborers, and apprentices, followed by school teachers, accountants, typists, and salesmen. As for the motives for seeking public recruitment instead of private introductions, they are nothing more than the following:

Those who need truly outstanding talents can carefully select their excellence from the group introduced in the detailed introduction of the vocational guidance office.

Unwilling to accept the emotional introduction of shareholders and other relevant personnel, and in order to avoid offending anyone, they would rather entrust an introduction agency to introduce them publicly.

The treatment is meager, and it is not easy to hire them in a short period of time.

The nature of the work is relatively specialized, and private introductions from friends and relatives may not be able to do the job satisfactorily.

The registration procedure is very simple. Job seekers only need to go to the office to fill out two registration forms. Then, the staff of the office will ask in detail about the items filled in and observe their actions, abilities, personality, interests, academic ability, etc. from the conversation of the registrants, and make a simple record for reference when the requesters select talents. Then, registration form A will be classified into the registration card box according to their desired or capable positions, so that the requesters can select from the classification when they need any talents. Registration form B will be numbered according to the number of strokes of their names and placed in the registration card box in order, so that the registrant can be found in a few seconds when they come to contact again, as a basis for contacting and talking.

As for those who come to the office to seek talents, they first fill out a request form, stating in detail the conditions and treatment of the talents they need. Then, they select one by one from the A type registration card according to their conditions and hand it over to the requester for self-selection. The office will send a notification to arrange a meeting, and then the office will carefully assess it and send a letter of introduction to the requester's side, and the requester will select one person from five or six people.

Six months after the introduction is completed, the office must solicit the opinions of both the employer and the employee. If there are any differences, the office will mediate to adjust them. If the employer has any criticisms of the person introduced, the office will also be responsible for talking to the person introduced, giving advice or correcting them, until both parties are satisfied.

The vocational introduction office does not charge any fees for this procedure. It is purely for social service and social welfare.

In addition to introducing occupations, the office also has departments for career change guidance, vocational guidance, and employment guidance. If someone is dissatisfied with their current occupation and intends to change to another occupation, they must be persuaded in various ways to make efforts to improve on their own position and strive for happy employment. For those who have just stepped into society from school and are choosing a career, they will be guided on the path and preparation of choosing a career. After obtaining a career, they will also be guided on the attitudes and key points that they should have in service, so as not to lose it again. During each winter and summer vacation, the office will also do its best to provide guidance to graduates of all levels of schools on choosing schools and subjects.

According to Mr. Yang, the two major purposes of the office are to make the unemployed have jobs and to make the employed enjoy their jobs. Mr. Yang also expressed three opinions on relieving unemployment.

Take the opportunity to disperse the population and relocate factories to the interior to set up small factories, and hold a general registration of the unemployed. The registration nature can be divided into three categories: technical talents, technical workers, and ordinary workers, as a preparation for inland factories to recruit workers.

The government should raise a large sum of money to be used as a fund for small loans for the unemployed, so that the unemployed can have the capital to operate a small business.

Take advantage of the fact that hoarders are releasing a large amount of goods and the business of various companies and stores is in a downturn to organize a relief unemployment sales team. All goods that need to be sold can be sold through the sales team. The salesmen will be examined by the host and asked to provide a guarantee. The proceeds from the sales, in addition to the cost and the profit due, will be distributed to the salesmen to maintain their minimum livelihood.

Career guidance and introduction agencies are highly valued and widely established in European and American countries and Japan. Before the war, only the China Vocational Education Society in our country, and after the war, the private career introduction agencies in this city, as of now, except for the career guidance of the Youth Association, which still exists in name, have all been closed. The government-run one is also the only one. It is said that the office's operating expenses are subsidized by the Ministry of Social Welfare, with 50,000 yuan per month. There are only three staff members, and each person's monthly salary is only 7,000 to 8,000 yuan (meals and accommodation are at their own expense). Although it is nominally affiliated to the Municipal Social Welfare Bureau, there is no subsidy. The office had planned to hold a happy employment movement and a study abroad and employment guidance movement, but due to funding reasons, it could not be realized.

### Debt

— Shuang Chen

Yao'er is sick!

Very sick, it's acute pneumonia. His little mouth is gasping for breath, the movement of his eyes is sluggish, his two little hands are clenched tightly, spasmodically against his chest, his two little lips change from rose to purple, to white, to black; how can a child of only eight full months bear such a disease? So the whole family is in chaos, my wife is sobbing and tearful, at a loss, trembling and shouting: "What, what to do: ah?" My heart is even more panicked, even more at a loss, pacing around the room, muttering words I don't know what I'm saying.

The child's little hands convulsed for a while, seeming to be a little better, lying on the small bed, his face was pale, breathing slightly short, his little eyes half open and half closed... struggling, fighting with his little life. I couldn't bear to look at this pitiful sight. At this moment, I really hate my own weakness and insignificance, unable to cure even a small child; I wish I could immediately transform myself and take the child's place, the child's illness would immediately move to my own body, and I would bear and endure all the child's suffering myself. But these are ultimately fantasies, which do nothing to help the reality, and will not reduce the child's illness by a single point.

My wife put the palm of her hand on the child's forehead and uttered such a sentence: "It's very hot!" Then, with a worried face, she complained to me: "Hey, think of a way! It's not a solution to continue like this." My wife's words made me sober up, reminding me of the idea of ​​finding a doctor immediately. Originally, finding a doctor when you are sick is the most important problem, and it is also the most common problem, but I was so anxious about my son's illness that I forgot about this most important thing.

"Finding a doctor" came to mind, but the next problem came again, first, which doctor to find? Second, where is the money to invite the doctor? The first question was finally settled after a thousand requests for teaching and ten thousand inquiries. We decided to invite Dr. Chen, a pediatrician with rich experience. But the consultation fee is very high, and the cost of injections and medicines constitutes an astonishing number in the eyes of the poor, which is also the most difficult second money problem to solve!

Secretly discussing with my wife: the little money I had saved before has been used to buy firewood and rice as much as possible - these things increase in price day and night and cannot be left out every day, and some remaining change has to be arranged for daily household expenses, in addition to which there is really no surplus, let alone a sum of money and such huge medical expenses? Now the only way is to borrow money from someone, but who to borrow from? Can I borrow it? Can't I borrow it? There is another series of difficult problems to solve. I try my best to search my mind again and again, but the result of the search always comes to a "〇". The familiar friends around me who are usually friendly enough are like me, or even not as good as me. They are all salaried classes who live on a fixed income. They are suffering under the pressure of life, living in a humble way, sending off the bitter days, and exclaiming at the life of tomorrow. Really, even the problem of their own survival is threatened at all times, let alone sharing a little surplus money to help others? As for the general friends who have had a glimpse or are "climbing high," of course, first, they are not friendly enough to be embarrassed to speak; second, I can't "drill," "flatter," or "toady"... these skills of making a living and getting rich. Otherwise, I wouldn't have to worry and be so poor because of a little illness of my son! But the child's illness must be treated, and the money must naturally be raised, so in desperation, I reluctantly think of a way, that is, to cooperate with my wife to borrow money separately. My wife's only way to get money is to discuss it with her parents' family, but the relationship between my wife and her two sisters-in-law has never been harmonious. Now, it is difficult for a woman who usually cherishes her face to do this kind of loaning thing - but for the sake of her child, or rather, the power of maternal love, she surprisingly agreed. I had to go to my poor friends' place, although I knew it would be a fruitless trip, and the child left behind had to be temporarily looked after by an old woman in the neighborhood.

The first step out of the door, my heart was in a mess. Which one should I look for first? After careful planning and careful consideration, I had to set off to the place of Mr. K, who was closer and had a better living condition, but as soon as I entered the door, my hope was shattered. Mr. K was lying sick in bed, and his wife was guarding the stove to decoct medicine. She told me in detail that her husband had been sick for a week, and the children were crying and shouting in the house, and the objects were piled up messily in the corner, which showed that Mr. K's illness was not light and his recent situation was down and out. When I saw Mr. K's sad face, I had no choice but to step forward and comfort him first, and then said goodbye in a hurry. Then I looked for a few poor friends, but I saw their poverty and embarrassment, and I lost the courage to borrow money from them. In fact, even if I opened my mouth to them, they would not satisfy my slightest hope in their situation of being unable to take care of themselves. Finally, an idea that I didn't want to think about was circulating in my mind. My primary school classmate, Mr. C, is now a nouveau riche and a prominent social celebrity. Although our opinions are different and our interests are not in line, relying on the friendship of six years of classmates, I think it will not be rejected to borrow a little money, but how unwilling should I be to do this kind of "thing against my wish"! But for the sake of money, for the sake of the child's illness, finally my feet involuntarily hesitated in front of the magnificent C mansion, and I mustered the courage for the third time before pressing the doorbell. The door opened, and an arrogant porter came out, looking me up and down. I reluctantly handed over a business card and stated my intention. He lazily led me into the reception room and did not greet me very much, so he went straight in. I stood tremblingly in the corner of the room, and saw my thin and haggard face from the dressing mirror, and my shabby clothes. How unharmonious it was to be in the grand and magnificent mansion! It was natural for the porter to cast a suspicious look at me. I waited, waited, for a long time the porter came out, I tidied my clothes, preparing to meet my old friend who had been separated for many years, but the porter replied coldly: "The master is not at home." I had to leave disappointed, and before leaving, I left a message on the card stating that I would visit again tomorrow. Under repeated requests, the porter finally reluctantly accepted it. Half a day of running around, the result was nothing. I had no resentment for wasting so much energy and time; but I was very worried about the child's illness and the money to treat the child's illness. Thinking like this, my legs were weak, flashing sparks exploded in my brain, and I was dizzy, almost falling down. I persisted with all my strength, resisting, but my precarious body was sometimes tilting to the left and right, and my pace slowed down. At this moment, I was suddenly awakened by the sound of a car "whirring, whirring". I quickly gave way to the side of the road, and the car slid past. But I suddenly saw the man in a suit sitting in the car, who was exactly the Mr. C I wanted to see, with a coquettish woman, leaving behind a string of frivolous and unrestrained laughter behind the car. At this time, I wanted to catch up and greet him, but the car had already sped away like lightning. Suddenly I looked back and the door of the C mansion was not far from me, and it can be determined that this car had just come out of this mansion, so I immediately realized that he had deliberately refused to see me. I stood blankly on the road, thinking foolishly, thinking foolishly, words such as "morality"... "human relationships"... "money"... "friends"... were all chaotically reflected and intertwined in my mind. But I didn't get a clue. I felt that I was insulted, and I immediately returned to the C mansion, retrieved the business card, and tore off the message on it on the spot. This kind of shame added to me, even pouring out the water of the entire West River, would not be enough to wash it clean! I glared at the porter and returned home with heavy steps!

But when I got home, I was like a defeated rooster, dragging a frustrated and slow pace. I met the threshold of my home with the strength of a thousand pounds. What is the responsibility of being a father? What can I explain to the child's illness? But what came back was an empty-handed, helpless poor bug, and the child who belonged to the poor bug was even more pitiful. I really couldn't bear to think about it anymore...

But unexpectedly, as soon as I entered the house, I saw that the house was crowded with people. The doctor was here, the mother-in-law was here, and my wife was busy dealing with it. Yao'er had already had two blood cleanings, one injection of grape juice, and drank a little medicine water, and was already able to sleep quietly!

After the doctor finished his task, he left in a hurry. The money was paid by my wife, of course, borrowed from my mother-in-law.

At this time, my mother-in-law habitually raised her tongue and nagged: "Why didn't you call me earlier? Alas! You shouldn't have made the child like this! You should have seen a doctor earlier when you are sick! Fortunately, now it seems that the child's illness is probably not serious..." Such a mother-in-law's nagging words would inevitably make me disgusted or even run away and ignore her in normal times, but now when I heard them, I felt an unusually kind and interesting feeling. I even felt that there was warmth in the world because of this. At the same time, the anger and obstruction I had just suffered were mixed with the current gratitude. A surge of hot tears exploded from my heart and rolled down unconsciously. I quickly wiped them away secretly.

After two more diagnoses and two weeks of recuperation, the child's illness gradually improved! And the father's debt was gradually accumulating, turning from a pile of small stones into a small mountain. Naturally, all these money came from my mother-in-law, and my mother-in-law's family was not well-off, so these money naturally came from somewhere else. I don't know how I will repay her in the future? At the same time, I dare not think: what kind of idle words are the two sisters-in-law saying behind my back? From now on, it is even more impossible to talk about maintaining my wife's face? And I don't know how much trouble this old lady has caused in the mother-in-law relationship? Ah ah! I really dare not continue to think about it!

Now the child's illness is considered completely cured. He can stand on my lap and laugh and play. His little mouth hangs with an innocent smile, and his two little hands are waving wildly in the air. My wife smiled and said: "This little life was picked up, how dangerous!" I also smiled along, but there were tears in the smile. From the I told me that my face was much thinner and haggard. Sometimes I woke up in the middle of the night and felt that there was something that had not been done well? Then I thought of the "debt". It was like a thousand-pound stone pressing on my heart, squeezing, squeezing; it was also like thousands of small on my heart wall, ing, sucking... so that I would never

From now on, I am really afraid to see " ", and I don't know how to pay it back? Ah ah! What about the days after, child! "Debt"! "Life"! What to do? Let's not talk about it!

### Sacrificing for Work

— Bai Ding

Sacrifice, is this what sacrifice is like? Your blood never flowed on the battlefield, your sweat never soaked the battle robe, yet, in the vast crowd of Liaoguan, you have silently sunk away like this, and your image is gradually fading in people's memories. Can the meaning of sacrifice be so great, and yet so small?

Forgotten, you have been so easily forgotten. A spark has burned out the plains of your life, leaving behind only a pile of cold ashes, a gust of wind! How unbearable it is to forget, yet how easy it is to forget?!

Dead, have you died just like that? I watched you tossing and groaning, but in an instant, why did you become so weakly silent? The boundary between life and death! It seems so close, and yet so distant!…

Walking past ward sixteen in the morning, unaccustomed, I caught sight of the empty bed raised high, like the human skeleton in anatomy class; so empty. The gray figure under the dim light resurfaced in my mind--

Everyone knew that L-jun's illness was hopeless. The dreadful terminal tuberculosis. So the news of his death didn't shock anyone, because when he was still alive, people didn't consider him living. It was just that the nurse made one more bed in the morning, took two more tablets of calcium lactate when dispensing medicine, and the doctor mechanically turned his chart over. Day after day, year after year, it became too habitual. It was as if this matter, this person, didn't exist. Until one less bed was made, the medication card was taken away, and the chart was removed, only then did people realize something had happened—a break in routine—they said, "Oh, he's dead!" Seeming a bit sorry, but then they went back to doing other things with a smile; there were still many beds to make, medicine to dispense, injections to give, etc... They were busy working, darting back and forth among various bacteria, just like L-jun used to work. But the tuberculosis bacteria let L-jun rest, forever!

The bell of the Jianghai Customs rang ten times, and I still hadn't gotten off work, but my eyes were getting heavy. There was a magazine spread out on the desk, but I couldn't focus on a single word. Suddenly the electric bell rang, it was ward sixteen. L-jun's older sister gently said to me, "He's not doing well, he's rambling and saying strange things, I'm a little scared, please keep me company." I immediately agreed, put on a mask, and stood blankly beside L-jun's bed with her.

It was indeed a bit frightening. L-jun's eyes were wide open; rolling in his deep-set sockets, his dull gaze slowly moving from left to right, then slowly from the window to the door. It was truly a sight that made one break out in a cold sweat. His thin hands, no, just withered branches; trembled and reached out towards the door. He began to move his wooden lips; "Look, two people are coming!" We followed his gaze to the door; but who was coming? But it seemed as if those two invisible people had entered, L-jun raised his arms, shaking them, pointing, nodding, his lips moving laboriously, as if he were talking to those two people, perhaps even speaking English. Curious, I leaned closer to listen, but couldn't understand two sentences. Those terrifying eyeballs slowly moved to my face, "You… you…" He said two words to me, then stopped abruptly, making me involuntarily take two steps back. "Close your eyes, don't imagine things, your sister is here with you." His sister lowered his hand, smoothed the blanket, and said in a trembling voice, "Oh... you... you are my third sister…" He seemed a bit more lucid, and weakly closed his eyelids. I softly asked Miss L, "Are you his third sister?" "No, my third sister isn't in Shanghai, he... he can't even recognize me..." She wiped away tears with a handkerchief, not crying out loud. She was also a nurse. The room was very quiet, only L-jun's labored breathing, exhaling but not inhaling, made our nerves tense. Gurgling sounds, as if there was a lot of phlegm in his throat. We took a sputum cup and tried to get him to spit, but he still knew to try, but was too weak to spit it out; we turned his head to the side, but still nothing came out. We noticed the black part of his eyes, gradually rolling upwards, upwards, until only the whites were left, his eyelids half-closed, and his mouth wide open, his white teeth exposed. Miss L put down the sputum cup, took my hand, and cried out mournfully. What could I say to comfort her? My own eyes were already soaked in tears as well. "There's nothing to be done, I'm the only one in Shanghai, please have them wrap him up and take him to the morgue! I... I'll come... come to collect the body tomorrow morning..." She covered her face and ran out into the hallway.

Turning back, the gray corpse under the dim light actually made me feel cowardly, and I quickly closed the screen and ran to report to the doctor.

The doctor came and listened to his heart, and many colleagues also came. In a moment, L-jun, wrapped in a white sheet, was carried out of ward sixteen by the workers…

### Meteor

— Bai Fan

The meteor in the deep night has a seductive beauty. That shrewd gaze makes people sad, and moss of melancholy grows all over the heart, unable to contain the sparks of desire in the gaps. What is it about its charm that makes people sigh? The radiance ignites youthful eyes. Oh, clever ones, don't be mocked! The dazzling meteor is romantic, aloof, and that bizarre smile makes people panic. As it streaks across the dark night, in the mournful wind, withered grasses groan painfully; laugh, clever ones, be as indifferent as cold branches, and hide your trembling hearts deep in the valleys to weep for the meteor, that seductive beauty.

### Gleanings of Floating Duckweed

— Lu Wen

"A bosom friend afar brings a distant land near." —Wang Bo—

Preface

People often compare the gatherings and separations in this world to floating duckweed. If this analogy is appropriate, then I will love duckweed even more. Because recently, in an extraordinarily coincidental opportunity, I was reunited with three people whom I had parted ways with a long time ago, and at the time of our initial farewell, none of us had imagined that we would ever see each other again. For this reason, I have written down some things, for myself and for others.

One: Teacher

After the streetcar stopped at a station, another group of passengers squeezed in. One of them was holding a large leather bag in one hand and trying to get his money out with the other. The streetcar started, and the car body shook, causing that passenger to fall on a seated passenger—me.

So I closed the magazine I was reading and looked up.

"I'm sorry, I'm sorry."

But before he could finish apologizing, I had already exclaimed:

"Ah! Mr. Ma!"

I stood up and offered him my seat.

"Let me think…" He sat down: "You're from Y Middle School, aren't you? …You seem to be called Lu… Lu……"

"Lu Wei-bao!" I stood in front of him, like a child: "Mr. Ma doesn't recognize me anymore."

"I recognize you, I recognize you." Mr. Ma smiled happily: "However, in recent years, my brain has become increasingly worse than before."

Without a doubt, Mr. Ma was a good teacher. When I was studying at Y Middle School, he taught us advanced algebra and trigonometry, and his explanations were really clear. Because he was teaching at six schools at the same time, due to scheduling constraints, his classes were often arranged after the last period, from six to seven o'clock. But we all waited for the class to start, and no one ran away.

"Does Mr. Ma still eat dinner on the streetcar now?" I suddenly remembered something.

"Yes. There's really no way around it. …Sometimes there are no streetcars, so I have to run on my two legs."

Looking at the teacher's gray hair, (the top of his head was already a bit bald,) I felt like I had nothing to say. —Yes, what else could I say?

"Where are you working now?" After a long while, he looked up and asked.

"I'm teaching arithmetic at a middle school." I mumbled in reply. I felt like I was insignificant in front of that teacher.

But this sparked his sigh:

"Time really flies, you're teaching at a middle school too."

"Mr. Ma is currently…?" I interrupted, wanting to break the awkward atmosphere.

"Me? I'm still messing around at those few schools." The gray-haired old teacher sighed deeply: "Still the same as before. Sending class after class from junior high to senior high, giving them exams, sending them off to graduate, enter university… then sending a new batch from junior high into senior high…"

"Mr. Ma is truly tireless in his teaching…"

"It's not like that, life forces you to, otherwise who would be willing to run around all day long? …I heard that Mr. Liu from Y Middle School, recently made several deals in Western medicine, worth nearly ten million. …I just can't do it, and to this day it's still 'nothing accomplished, hair streaked with gray'…"

The streetcar stopped, and Mr. Ma stood up hurriedly.

"I've arrived. Come to my house to chat when you have time, I'd really like to hear about how you teach arithmetic?"

Looking at the shadow of the white-haired old teacher on the sidewalk, a strange feeling rose from my heart.

Two: Old Classmate

I saw the name of an old classmate in a magazine, indulged in a moment of sentimentality, and wrote a letter to ask about him. Half a month later, I received a reply; my letter was not written in vain. This was truly something that no one had expected, a classmate from a village elementary school in our hometown, separated for ten years, would meet again in the midst of war and chaos. Moreover, what a bizarre encounter this was!

That classmate wrote at the end of the letter:

"...In half a month, I will come to Shanghai for magazine matters,

When the time comes, I will visit you at your residence to chat about what we have been up to since we last met.…"

I waited with a warm heart.

Before half a month had passed, I received another letter:

"…Recently, worldly affairs have been numerous and busy, leaving me with almost no free time. I have had to cancel my trip to Shanghai. The date of our reunion will have to be postponed to another day.…"

I thought about how the gatherings and separations of life are originally like floating duckweed, like flying catkins. It's not common to run into each other again after being separated for ten years, is it? What did the poet Du Fu say?

"Life is separation: like the stars of Shen and Shang."

Just like that old classmate, I was only in the same fifth-grade class with him for one semester before I skipped to junior high. And during our time at school, we weren't exactly close friends, just ordinary classmates. When we parted ways, there was certainly no talk of farewells, because we children didn't understand such things at all, and besides, we were separated almost as soon as we met.

"How have the last ten years changed him?"

Back then, he was called a "model student." The meaning of "model student" included good grades, neat handwriting, listening to the teacher, sitting up straight in class, and always trimming fingernails, etc.

"Is he still like that now?" I wondered.

I don't know if we will have the chance to meet again, life's gatherings and separations are originally like broken stems of floating duckweed. However, if such things are ultimately rare, I am satisfied with the current outcome. Thank you, green-clad messenger, for sending a little thought of longing for the departed. Well, let us hold onto this hopeful heart until the very end.

Three: Student

At a street corner, I ran into a student from a free school that I ran two years ago.

To make way for a truck, he jumped off an old bicycle.

The boy looked up blankly, looking around:

"Oh, Mr. Lu!"

"Where are you working now?" I suddenly felt that this question was inappropriate. Other than the free school, he wouldn't be transferred around like some students. So I immediately changed my question: "What are you doing now?"

"Carrying rice." He pointed to his bicycle: "I carry it to Beixinjing or Qishi every day."

"Your father? —How did it come to the point that you have to carry rice?"

"Dad died last year. He cut himself on the barbed wire, got injured, came back and slept for three days, then—"

"How much rice can you carry?" I looked at his old bicycle.

"I can probably carry more than one dan, sometimes I can carry two dan. An uncle of mine is more capable than me, he can carry three dan."

"Three dan? How do you arrange it on the bike?"

"Look, I arrange it like this!" He gestured:

"Hang one dan on this side, one dan on that side, and pile another dan on top."

"What about your younger sister?" I remembered that he had a younger sister who was in the third grade back then.

"Younger sister? She's selling vegetables with my mother now. —Mr. Lu, do you have a watch? What time is it now?"

"Half past eleven." I said.

"Then I have to go, people are still waiting for me over there. Goodbye, Mr. Lu."

"Goodbye," I watched him jump on the bike.

How ashamed I should be. Such a child has already placed the burden of life on his own shoulders, and he, this child who is at most fourteen years old, is not afraid at all, walking the path that people want him to walk.

I remembered that in school, this child, Wu Hai-xiong, was often a headache for the teachers. He wouldn't listen in class; he wouldn't do his homework; he was always the one causing trouble; he was also the one cheating during exams—

But now, look, how he has changed.

Do you know how steel is made? How is it made?

### Youth and Youth Day

— Shao Yu-gang

In the season of rippling spring breezes, we have finally waited for Youth Day again.

This ancient Asian country, full of suffering and calamity, in modern history, shouldered the heavy fate of the nation. Treading on fire disasters, man-made disasters, foreign invasions, and internal turmoil, starting from the Opium War of 1838, it has already been one hundred and seven years.

In this situation of continuous warfare and exhausted people, the young Chinese sons and daughters, generation after generation, spanning two centuries, tasted all the sweetness, sourness, bitterness, and spiciness. In the most difficult spiritual and material conditions, they shouldered the unfinished historical obligations left by their ancestors—those thorns on the road to the new century that should have been swept away long ago—and the unfinished revolutionary cause since the Xinhai Revolution. Our previous generations only did some superficial and empty things. The difficult and enormous practical work, however, was left behind. This is deeply rooted and stubborn, but their descendants, seeing the precariousness of their motherland, finally bravely ignored how heavy and thorny it was, and quickly started working on it.

The Opium War knocked open the door of this aging dynasty, ushering in an epoch-making first time that all Chinese descendants comprehensively opposed the encroachment of the international white race on their country; the vigorous Taiping Heavenly Kingdom revolutionary movement of 1849 revealed the young generation's strong and boundless will to resist the dark feudal forces; the Xinhai Uprising under the Wuchang city and the success of the Northern Expedition of the Revolutionary Army further demonstrated that our excellent descendants of the Yellow Emperor, for the brilliant future of the new China, truly possessed great irresistible power!

Our young generation was born amidst fierce and violent artillery fire; grew strong amidst the bloodstains of the martyrs who fell one after another. The youth have been forged to be very brave, and they are no longer afraid, no matter what great difficulties they will encounter. Although China is still in the midst of battle, has not yet broken out of this dark wilderness, and there are still many bumps and hardships arranged on the road, they will finally be cleared and eliminated. The Chinese youth of the 1940s should be proud. The law of history has designated them—to be great combatants and flag bearers for the completion of the Greater East Asia War and the promotion of peace. How should they, with great confidence, march forward, treading on barbed wire?!

The fate of China is multifaceted; the Chinese youth have suffered. For a century, they have been subjected to the bullying of foreign races and the oppression of rites and teachings. Therefore, the precocious Chinese youth finally stood up and said what they wanted to say. The great May Fourth Movement was our first loud cry. Young people resolutely insisted: "Demand innovation! Demand thorough innovation!"

In the first glorious fact in the history of the youth movement, Shanghai youth cannot be separated. She has had glorious days of honor. She is the beating heart of Chinese youth, just like the position Shanghai occupies in the country.

Undeniably, today's Shanghai youth have not done enough to fulfill their historically due obligations. A part of college students abandoned their precious time, and went madly on with their fashionable playthings; a part of professional youth were often confused by the abnormal psychology of crazy speculation and hoarding, and confused their own nature; a part of young girls were obsessed with competing with their fashions… Naturally, this is only a part of people who are willing to degenerate, those wastes who are about to become the dregs of the era, and are not worthy of people's pity. Youth! How can we explain this? Will history lightly forgive us for the past?

However, time will never wait for you and forgive us. Soon, we will step into the thrilling days of late May again! In this season of blood and enmity, there is our own intimate day! —The youthful, leaping, hot, great "5/5" festival has arrived!

What achievements can we use to approach her? Do we feel pride or shame?

Youth Day is great, but only under the love and support of the vast majority of outstanding youth can it exert a wonderful greatness; youth is precious, but it should be in the Youth Day, we can examine our own strength and dare to reveal our shortcomings, it can be regarded as precious, we should remember her organic chain, to make deep reflection.

Youth! Please be frank and count your own debts on this "5/5" festival!

### Retrospective and Prospects of Shanghai Youth Movement in the Past Two Years

— Xiao Yi

In March of the 33rd year, gambling dens in the Nanshi district were suddenly demolished by a group of spirited young students. The people of Shanghai, after being stunned and cheering, became familiar with this group of courageous young men, which was the first time the Shanghai youth showed themselves to the people of Shanghai with practical activities.

In fact, the formal emergence of a systematic organizational force among the vast youth groups began with the establishment of the old eight districts sub-branch in the 33rd year. At that time, it had more than 20,000 young people inside and outside the schools, and 198 trained cadres. The work progressed smoothly at that time, so it was able to achieve such high achievements because there was a best condition existing, that is, the youth group and the Baojia authorities achieved close ties.

Throughout the year of the 33rd year, the main work was to cultivate local cadres in various regions of the old eight districts (divided by Baojia areas), so the tentacles of the work had not yet penetrated into the vast youth and student layers of various industrial and school departments, but the training of junior cadres was successful. But good times do not last long. With the merger of the administrative institutions of the first and second districts, the original sincere cooperation between "Youth" and "Bao" was declared separated due to various difficulties and setbacks.

Since the second half of the 33rd year, with no office expenses at the top and a lack of staff at the bottom, relying on the youthful innocence of the young people, overcoming all obstacles and difficulties, and after all the hardships, finally supported the new model of the first district branch. By the end of the year, there were more than 200 members, but most of them were old comrades left over from the training class of cadres in the old eight districts, who were working together because of their like-mindedness.

In February of the 34th year, the branch address began to move from Fangbang Road to Paomade. The location was suitable, and the work had a new look. Therefore, new members from the old first district and the western part of Shanghai continued to join. Now there are nearly 400 members, and more than ten full-time staff members under the command.

At this point, the new model of the district branch is almost complete.

During this period, there are two main tasks:

The first is to fully rectify the internal organization and discipline. — (At that time, it was found that one or two unscrupulous elements, taking advantage of the transition between the old and the new of the branch and the lack of staff, impersonated the name of the district branch, and cheated, intimidated and harassed in some taverns and teahouses in the old eight districts. However, after the case was investigated, they were expelled and punished. This phenomenon was quickly eliminated. If any circles find it in the future, please notify this branch to punish them severely.) This point is generally successful. Up to now, the general affairs, training, coaching, and organization under the command have all undergone thorough mobilization to seek innovation; at the same time, more than 200 young comrades have also undergone individual heart-to-heart talks, trying to unify their political ideas and work goals, and trying to avoid being drafted in a perfunctory manner, so as to achieve the excellent level of consciously and spontaneously participating in the work.

The second is to strengthen service and expand publicity. Any major gathering and association in Shanghai is inseparable from the first district branch. The most prominent ones are the Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Birthday Tree Planting Day Conference, the Capital Returning Commemoration Conference, the Unified National People's Congress... all of which are responsible for the entire arrest work of the conference by this district branch (At the same time, nearly half of the comrades in this district branch participated in the fourth brigade and fourth battalion of the Model Youth Corps of the Republic of China. Therefore, the fourth brigade's work is also the dispatch of some cadres and comrades of the district branch) Especially the lectures in theaters and teahouses on the Capital Returning Commemoration Day were praised by the social people. For example, when the comrades of our lectures left after finishing their lectures in the Majestic Grand Theater and Dadong Xindu and other teahouses, within one or two minutes, there was still cheers and applause, proving that the audience was moved, and it also showed that the work had achieved a part of the effect.

Recently, in view of the increasingly harsh Great East Asia War, Shanghai has approached the edge of the artillery fire. Everything related to local security, wartime air defense; the evacuation of population and industry; the relief of out-of-school and unemployed people; all need local officials and social advances to advocate in front; and the vast youth to act after, but the youth without organization can not play a role. The district branch deeply understands this, so it selects 200 outstanding young people inside and outside the school above the high school level (which can be expanded if the industrial associations cooperate in the future) to organize a service team to be used when the municipal government authorities and all sectors of society have important work to serve, but in the case of soaring labor and production, a poor civil movement organization, if it does not get the financial assistance of the industrial sectors in the society, can not do it anyway. It happened that this district branch planned to perform "The Soul of the Party Member" by one of the affiliated youth drama clubs at the Majestic Grand Theater to celebrate the May Fourth Youth Day and expand the publicity effect, and planned to perform four shows at the Queen's Grand Theater on May 11, 12, 14, and 15 to collect financial assistance from all walks of life for the organization of the service team.

The above is the organizational status and general work of this district branch.

Obviously, the Shanghai youth movement is progressing in a very deformed and extremely chaotic process. The names and systems of the organization are really diverse. In addition to the Shanghai Municipal Branch of the China Youth League and its affiliated school district branches, there are also the air defense groups and self-defense groups organized by the Baojia Office (It is said that these similar organizations are recently planned to be merged into the Model Self-Defense Corps) This organization has the largest scale and is widely spread throughout Shanghai. In addition, there are the Sino-Japanese Youth Comrades Association, the China Youth Construction Team, etc., and its meaning is more single, such as the College Student Crime Prevention Research Association, the College Student Academic Research Association, etc. As a result, they are divided into four and five, and each goes its own way, so the strength is dispersed, and they can only do some empty formal work. In fact, which group can be said to have organization and strength?

Secondly, the municipal government officials and social advances can listen to the voices of the youth, care about the lives of the youth, and believe in the strength of the youth, and boldly give them work to do, and at the same time, they must supervise them to do it seriously. Under the condition that it does not conflict with their occupation and studies, the youth are willing to serve the society.

In March of this month, the reorganization of the New Movement Branch has not been completed. Mr. Gu Senqian, who is wise, capable, experienced, and rich, served as the Secretary-General of the New Movement Branch and concurrently served as the Deputy Commander of the Municipal League Affairs. At the joint celebration of the Municipal District League to welcome Deputy Commander Gu, Deputy Commander Gu sincerely gave us a speech, reiterating that the youth movement in Shanghai will have a bright future in the short term; all difficult problems will be properly solved, and he hoped that the comrades would not be afraid of difficulties and retreat, and should continue to work with the will of not being afraid of difficulties...

Yes, we will definitely continue to work with the will of absolute belief and not being afraid of difficulties, and achieve results in a certain short period of time.

### Work Report

The first district branch recently plans to organize a service team, and welcomes young people with a high school degree or above to participate. It is especially welcome if the industrial associations and colleges and universities can submit a written guarantee. The branch address is at No. 101 Jiangyin Road.

The Shanghai West Office of the First District Branch will start the first cadre concentration training on April 30. The registration is very enthusiastic. It is reported that more than 60 people have been selected and started training.

Ten representatives of the Shanghai team participated in the third capital review of the National Youth League of this year. They gathered at the first district branch at 4:30 am on May 2 and set off together, taking the 8 o'clock express train to Beijing.

The Yi Qing Drama Club is about to perform "The Soul of the Party Member" at the Queen, scheduled from the 11th to the 15th of this month, and will rehearse at the Queen's Grand Theater on May 4, and will perform on May 5 to celebrate, I heard that the drama troupe will continue to rehearse Bihua Blood and Yunnan Uprising in the future, and a large number of male and female actors are needed. Young men and women who love drama can sign up to participate.

### The Future of Shanghai Youth

— Chen Ping

The active, youthful, and great "May Fourth" Youth Day has arrived at the time of the urgent Great East Asia War! Commemorating this historical and extensive youth festival today has very important significance. Recalling what Mr. Kosaka Masayasu, the representative of the allied nation Japan, said at the Great East Asia Youth Leaders Symposium last year: "The highest ideal of the Japanese Youth League movement is to unite the strength of Japanese youth and contribute to the country." Under this highest goal, the Japanese youth movement has shown a new and heroic attitude in increasing its work. The youth movements in other allied countries and in Europe and the United States have also made heroic achievements in the current war situation. This proves that the strength of the youth is great and cannot be underestimated, and it is the lifeblood of the country and the nation, and it is the element of building new and creating new.

The Shanghai youth movement has occupied a glorious page in the history of the Chinese youth movement! In the autumn of the crisis of the survival of the country, they contributed their strength and flesh and blood! In the death of the blood of the corrupt old society, they bravely injected their fresh blood! All this shows that the characteristics of young people are pure and enthusiastic, they are sharp feelers of the real society, and they are the driving force of the real society!

However, today, the Shanghai youth movement is not only in a low stage but also has formed a serious crisis. The special deformed development of Shanghai society has caused the vast youth to be dissatisfied with the status quo and to be depressed about the status quo. The deepening development of this phenomenon has pushed the vigorous climax of the past Shanghai youth movement into the trend of depression and pushed it into the sewage ditch of decline and depravity. Today, the most serious depression disease of Shanghai youth is the hope for themselves and the inability to withstand the blows of the environment. School youth are desperately studying in books, but their hearts painfully feel that the fate of dropping out of school has been sentenced. Professional youth work hard from morning to night, and the result they get cannot take care of their families and cannot fill their stomachs. In the midst of the sound of layoffs, they are worried about their poor jobs. And the vast number of young people who are abandoned outside the gate of society are wandering all day long. Although most of the young people are free and normal from the outside, there are great defects in practice. They are running around in the stock market, inquiring enthusiastically about transactions, and are happy in various games and gatherings. These phenomena indicate that young people are spinning in the reverse current of retreat, in the selfish struggle for profit, and in the venting of abnormal depression. "Dropping out of school," "unemployment," "thought," and "life" These depression diseases are seriously growing in the corners of young people's lives. The basic source of this is that the war has changed everything about Shanghai society, and at the same time, the complex economic development of Shanghai society itself has affected the uneasiness of many people's lives. However, we cannot allow this decline, selfishness, and corruption to continue to exist. At present, we are facing the decisive battle period of the Great East Asia War, and it is urgent to mobilize the strength of all participating countries. Moreover, the youth are the largest force to defend the country and protect the society? Especially in the future, the environment in Shanghai will be in danger of air raids. Mobilizing the Shanghai part of the force to ensure the order of the local society and the security of the society, and to alleviate the spread of the air defense crisis, and to assist in increasing production and evacuating the population, these are the urgent tasks of the Shanghai people in the future, and they are also the practical tasks that the Shanghai youth should shoulder.

We firmly believe that in this historical and urgent period, the Shanghai youth brothers will bravely open up their own bright and glorious future, and will certainly live up to the important responsibilities given by the society and the country. And we believe that our country and all sectors of society will step up their leadership and help to us. Therefore, we strengthen the following work confidence and goals.

In this urgent period of the Great East Asia War, the Shanghai crisis has intensified, so the work of ensuring local security and social security, and assisting the government's production increase work are important parts of the youth work.

Mobilizing the national strength to serve the war is holistic, and young people should bravely participate first, so stepping up their physical exercise and strict training of military skills is the most realistic course for young people.

Assisting all social work, such as air raid shelter, injured rescue, fire fighting preparation, and evacuation of population, increase production in rural areas, investigation and promotion of social undertakings, etc., are all urgent tasks at present, and they are also the practical work of our young people. We hope that under the leadership of the relevant authorities, we will broadly carry out these work.

In the future, we will plan to promote the progress of life and welfare undertakings, and promote a variety of legitimate entertainment activities to enrich the vigorous spirit of the youth and integrate the enthusiastic strength of the youth. We hope that the Shanghai youth will unite under such goals.

Shanghai youth! Facing the active, youthful, and great "May Fourth" Youth Day today, let us hold hands tightly, strengthen our confidence, and expand our bright future, "We must inject new youth blood into the old Chinese body" to defend the survival of the country! To protect the health of the society!

SPORTS

### Talking about the Scenery at the End of the Season - Football

The football season is coming to an end early, so the late football affairs are particularly late. However, because Shanghai fans are particularly interested in football, the authorities have the heart to make persistent efforts. The most eye-catching football match recently is the Youth Cup football match the other day (3rd). What is in progress and is concerned about is the match between Baima and Qiaolian, and the football invitation league. First, we will comment on the Youth Cup match, and then add a statement to the latter two.

### Youth Cup Qiaolian Defeats Lianyi

In the Youth Cup football cold, Qiaolian and Lianyi were invited to fight. At a time when there are few wonderful football matches, fans flock to watch, so the situation is not lonely. As a result of the competition, Qiaolian finally defeated Lianyi 2-0 with its good recent performance, avenging the arrow in the football league.

Watching the performance of the two teams this time, there are few ideal results. Because Lianyi has too many adjustments (it has the flavor of basketball substitution), it has a feeling of not being concentrated. And the constant changes of the team members also show that they are out of tune, so how can they have a good performance. Looking at the analysis of Lianyi, they all have the appearance of lack of stamina, so their defeat is appropriate. And the absence of the two major generals Wu Qixiang and Song Lingsheng is a fatal injury. Because Wu was dismissed, Song missed it temporarily due to something, which is really unfortunate. Otherwise, there should be a better performance.

Although Qiaolian won 2-0, in fact, it did not have the past performance. The reason is probably because they are too confident and think that victory can be counted, so they inevitably reveal a little pride. Secondly, it is also a failure to try a new formation. Recently, the lineup of Qiaolian is quite fixed. But this time, the team made changes in the hope of a new attitude. It is difficult to expect results in a hurry. Indeed, the new formation is unfamiliar to each other. It was not until the original state was restored that there was a slight improvement.

In summary, Qiaolian has a point similar to the last Donghua in this session in terms of "qi", it can be seen that the football match has a lot to do with "qi".

### Baima Cup Changed to Welfare Match

The Baima Cup mentioned in the previous issue of this magazine, submitted to the Football Federation, the authorities have decided to change it to a welfare match. All competitions will be the responsibility of the Football Federation, and the expenses will be borne by Fuhua Tobacco Company. The purpose of this welfare is roughly to donate to the foreign Baojia expenses and the Education Association.

It is found that the Welfare Match has been held seven times in this session. Each time, strong teams are invited to compete, which is very attractive and the harvest is good. Therefore, it has a lot of help to the welfare undertakings of all parties. The benefiting institutions have expressed their infinite gratitude for this, and the players who participated in the competition have also received a lot of comfort from this.

Nai Zhe, the Baima team is based on Donghua, and borrows Song Lingsheng and Li Yichen of Lianyi to form a strong force, which cannot be said. It is agreed that Qiaolian will fight, which has the meaning of challenge, and it should also be a battle that our fans are looking forward to. It is agreed that Yi will have progress and success in ball skills. Then, competing with the soldiers of Baima, the battle process is tense and the ball skills are displayed, which can be expected. Many people say that the meeting between Baima and Qiaolian will be one of the most exciting scenes in this football season.

It is heard that the Baima team has been practicing tirelessly in recent days. The main cadre Cheng Boan and the manager Xu Zhihao are particularly excited. They often discuss and study with the athletes to make a name for themselves at that time. It is reported that this competition has been decided to be held within the next week. The good show is coming, and the fans have a day to appreciate it, and the eye is really not shallow.

### Invitation Football Match is in Progress

After the completion of the various competitions hosted by the Football Federation, it was decided to hold an invitation football match, which will be organized by the Sansheng Sports Association. The Football Federation originally planned to do it by itself, or because of limited manpower, it is necessary to take a rest at the end of the season, so it entrusted the Sansheng Sports Association to do it. It was originally scheduled to invite six strong Chinese and Western teams. It is now reported that the Sansheng authorities said that for the sake of the venue and time, and in order to achieve the purpose of凑, it is tentatively decided to invite the four strongest teams on the sea to compete in a round robin. The so-called four strong teams will still be half Chinese and half Western. The Chinese team should be Donghua Lianyi. The Western team must be Qiaolian and the Portuguese Chamber of Commerce. However, it is difficult to determine at present whether there will be changes in the team members of each team at that time. (Mei)

### Overview of Pingjin Basketball

Zhang Xianlun and Quan Changchun, the strong players of the Hualian Pharmaceutical Factory basketball team, went to Pingjin for sightseeing with Fan Qinggong, a famous player in the North, a month ago. They were warmly welcomed by the basketball circles in the North, and they were firmly invited to form a "Hulian" team temporarily to slightly comfort the people there. It can be seen that the fans in the North pay attention to the basketball in Shanghai. Now that Zhang Quan has returned to Shanghai a few days ago, the author has met with him and talked about the simple situation of basketball in the North. I will briefly introduce it next:

### Basketball Interest is Universal

Pingjin is known as the cradle of basketball in our country. The interest in basketball there is still more than other sports and ball games. All primary schools and middle schools and universities, where there are ball fields, must have a large number of basketball equipment, and the school authorities are also doing their best to promote it. Therefore, basketball can be called the most popular sport in the North.

### Tianjin has More Talents

In Beijing, the only team that is worthy of being called the strongest is the Beixing team, which once filmed Shanghai. And Tianjin has Yongjin, Jinwei, and Tai Dong three teams, and their strength is above the standard, especially the Tai Dong team is no less than the representative team of Tianjin City. Such famous generals as Liu Xueqi, Wang Hongbin, and Chuan Jinsheng are all in the area. It is found that the results of Beixing and Tianjin teams are not much different, so the standard of the two places is in parallel, and Tianjin has more talents.

### Ball Field is Larger and Slippery

The ball field in the North that can accommodate a large number of spectators is the outdoor sand and mud field. And most of the important competitions are held outdoors. Its area is slightly larger than the Shanghai Youth Ball Field. It is more vast and boundless to practice in the ball room in Shanghai. The ground is less muddy, and those who are not used to it feel quite slippery and difficult to control. After the speed is fully opened, it is extremely easy to fall down if you try to stop it. As in the most intense and tense time, there is a three-book iron rooster flavor.

### Audience Appreciation Level

The cheering of the audience when watching the ball is more than that in Shanghai, and it also has the color of the stage. And its appreciation point is more focused on the performing crisp lens. If those who attack with a slow-attack policy, they may not be able to win applause. Is this or the nature of the people in the North?

### Urgently Hope that Shanghai Goes North

According to this time, only Zhang Quan and two or three others went north, and they have been welcomed by the people there. When Zhang and others returned to Shanghai, the sports circles there entrusted Zhang and others to transfer the Shanghai basketball circles, and eagerly hoped that a purely southern team member could go to Pingjin to compete, to learn from each other, and to comfort the long-standing desire of the Shanghai fans. In fact, the Shanghai basketball team has not yet made a Northern Expedition, which is really regrettable. I don't know if the Shanghai teams can practice it? (Jie)

### Summary of Basketball Theory (18)

— Liang Zhaoan

### (5) Modern Offensive Method

There are many kinds of new tactics in modern basketball, and they are changing with each passing day, which cannot be fully described in this book. Generally speaking, before the rules canceled the center circle jump ball, and after the immediate system discussion, the basketball tactics must be attacked across the middle line within ten seconds. Can be roughly divided into two types. Fast attack and five-person joint attack method, delayed attack method. The former is the most popular and extremely popular tactic, while the latter is gradually eliminated due to the limitations of the rules change.

However, the current fast attack and five-person joint attack method have been quite different from the past after years of development, and its name has also has many kinds. In terms of fast attack, there are so-called "fireball" tactics, mixed war, and fierce tactics. In terms of five-person joint attack, there are positional warfare, slow attack, and hub attack method. These tactics are all tactics to break the five-person joint defense. Later, the "man-to-man" defensive method was popular among people. Therefore, there is also a so-called blocking offensive method to break it. Also, since the center circle jump ball was canceled, (in terms of rules, since 1938, the center circle jump ball is limited to the start of the second half and technical fouls.) There is also a tactic called no center circle jump ball. That is, after throwing into blue, throw the ball into the field from outside the end line, and start the competition again, which is a new tactic. From this point of view, it can be seen that the modern basketball offensive method is much more complicated than the defensive method. For the sake of clarity, the general meaning of various offensive methods is specifically described as follows:

### (A) Fast Attack Method

Although the fast attack method has various tactics such as fierce attack, mixed war, fireball war, and double V-shaped rapid war, its main purpose is the word rapid war. The so-called rapid war is to attack suddenly and fiercely when people are unprepared.

The method of fast attack, in addition to the fixed strategy, such as the double V-shaped rapid war method. Generally speaking, it is to start the attack after guarding the ball, taking advantage of the preparation of the opponent, or when it is too late to retreat. Use the straight-line long-pass ball method to quickly pass it to the companion under blue and throw it in, commonly known as "stealing cold rice". Or use a single gun and a horse, one person pats the ball and rushes forward to throw blue. Or use two people against one, three people against two, and four people against three to attack the opponent, making it impossible to defend and impossible to guard. The method of two people against one is the most effective.

### Volleyball Season to Begin: Introducing Two Outstanding Players, Male and Female

The volleyball league is being actively organized by the committee. Currently, it is only waiting for the venue to be finalized, and then we will see athletes gallop onto the court. Now, before the curtain rises, this reporter might as well introduce two outstanding talents, male and female, as a prelude.

— Wang Deyuan

Most volleyball athletes who can dominate the era are from Guangdong, which is because volleyball in Guangdong has historical connections. While there are certainly many volleyball players in the South, there are few who have achieved special results. Only this Mr. Wang Deyuan's volleyball skills are of the first class. In the current situation of declining talent in Shanghai, Wang Deyuan can be called a standout among mediocrity. He is now the mainstay of the White team's volleyball team and the sole figure for scoring points. His characteristic is fierce spiking, making it difficult for opponents to retaliate. His saves, blocking, and serving all have unique qualities. Apart from volleyball, Deyuan is not proficient in other sports, which may truly be because he is a gifted volleyball prodigy.

— Chen Meizhen

Miss Chen is the captain of the Three Provinces Women's Volleyball Team. Because of her tall stature, she occupies the central position in the front row, possessing the skill to spike left and kill right at will. I remember six or seven years ago, when Miss Chen represented the Xuanlu Volleyball Team for the first time, her skills shocked the veteran players. At that time, this reporter also felt that she should be a volleyball prodigy. To this day, Miss Chen can still maintain a point-winning spike among female players. However, she has not yet researched blocking and setting techniques. This is why she is always too heavily relied upon for scoring points in the team. Therefore, for Miss Chen to advance further and achieve success, she should study and practice in all aspects.

Apart from volleyball, Miss Chen has few achievements in other sports. Although she is also a member of the Three Young Women's Basketball Team, it is purely a case of filling the ranks. (Lean Person)
