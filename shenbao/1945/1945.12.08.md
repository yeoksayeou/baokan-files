### Hurley Criticizes Career Diplomats for Undermining President Roosevelt's Instructions; Soviet Union Willing to Be at Peace with China

[United States News Agency, Washington, 6th] General Hurley, who resigned as Ambassador to China last week, told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee today that the Soviet Union and the United States have the same attitude toward China. He stated: "The Soviet Union does not support the Chinese Communist Party, does not want a civil war in China, does not want to divide China, and wants to live in peace with China." He based his conclusion on "my conversations with Stalin and Molotov." He also praised Chairman Chiang and the National Government, saying, "China is like a wounded tiger struggling in a trap, fighting Japan alone for a very long time."

### Chairman Chiang's Heroic and Unyielding Struggle for National Rights

China could have compromised with Japan, and in fact, the terms of compromise were exceptionally favorable. At that time, we had not yet joined the war. However, Chairman Chiang was heroic and unyielding, fighting for the rights of the nation. Hurley concluded his two-day speech to the Foreign Relations Committee by saying that he resigned because career diplomats undermined his efforts to carry out the instructions of the late President Roosevelt. He stated that President Roosevelt had instructed him to support the Chinese National Government so that Chairman Chiang's forces could continue to fight the Japanese army on the battlefield. Senator Connally, a Democrat from Texas and chairman of the committee, asked, "Were you successful?" Hurley said that he had some success, but his efforts to "unite all forces in China" were thwarted by career diplomats. Hurley had previously stated that John Service and Dean Acheson were leading figures in the State Department who were hostile to him. Today, he added another name. Connally repeatedly tried to get Hurley to reveal this name. Finally, Hurley said, "Adolph A. Berle." Berle is now Under Secretary of State and formerly served as Assistant Secretary of State. Connally asked, "What did he do?" Hurley retorted, "What did he do? I didn't want to say, but since you asked—" Hurley then detailed the history of the Iran Declaration and other American policies. (It is claimed that Hurley said that Berle and others overturned American foreign policy in Iran.) After this, Hurley accused his "political advisors, Fulton Freeman and Raymond Ludden," of not helping him carry out President Roosevelt's instructions. He also accused Acheson and Service of telling the Chinese Communist Party that Hurley did not truly represent the United States.

### Wedemeyer Loyal and Devoted; Warned Subordinates to Follow Government Policy

Connally asked, "How did they tell the Communist Party?" Hurley replied, "They told the Communist Party through letters, conversations, and meetings with the Communist Party." Hurley further stated that the American "multiple administrative agencies overseas and military representatives did not carry out our country's foreign policy."

Senator Bridges asked, "Did Lieutenant General Wedemeyer do his duty?" Hurley said, "General Wedemeyer's original contribution and loyalty are beyond reproach." He said he had gathered his subordinates and warned them that the President's instruction was that everyone should follow the government's policy during wartime, whether they agreed with it or not. Hurley added, "I think they may not agree with American policy, but since we are at war, and our policy is determined by our legitimate government, we can only implement this policy and cannot advocate for anything else."

Senator Wheeler asked, "Were you at that time fairly mediating between the two sides, and were they not?" Hurley replied, "Yes!" "So they were colluding with the Communists?" Hurley replied, "I cannot say that they were disloyal to us, but they believed that overthrowing Chairman Chiang was the most beneficial thing for China. I told them that the President's order was to support Chairman Chiang." Wheeler further asked, "If an ambassador's subordinates engage in such actions, should there be a remedy?" Hurley replied, "Indeed, I have dismissed them. After they returned to Washington, they became my supervisors and undermined my policy." Wheeler asked, "Who should be responsible for promoting them?" Hurley replied, "I am 13,000 miles away from my country. I cannot know everything, but the Secretary of State is traditionally the head of the State Department." After repeated questioning by Connally, Hurley admitted, "I believe that the staff in the Near East Office sincerely support the State Department's policy. Henderson, who manages the department, has supported President Truman's policy. I believe that although Under Secretary of State Berle is a major opponent of this policy, I do not know how many people in the department support him." Hurley then issued a lengthy and emotional declaration discussing human rights, the interests of democracy, the obligations of rulers, the merits of the Atlantic Charter, and the key points of the Iranian Declaration. He earnestly called for the linkage of diplomatic activities, demanded the implementation of better methods for recruiting diplomatic personnel, and praised the United Nations organization. Connally then thanked Hurley and announced that Secretary of State Byrnes would appear as a witness on the 7th.

### Chairman Chiang Concerned About Student Unrest; Expresses Determination to Handle it Fairly; Vice Minister of Education Chu Ching-nung Flew to Kunming Yesterday Afternoon

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 7th] Chairman Chiang is very concerned about the student strike in Kunming. On the afternoon of the 7th, he specially dispatched Vice Minister of Education Chu Ching-nung to Kunming to handle the matter and issued a letter to the educational community of Kunming, which was telegraphed to the authorities and faculty of various schools in Kunming, expressing that he would handle this matter fairly and urged the students to resume classes immediately. The full text is as follows: Student unrest has occurred in Kunming, and students have suspended classes for more than ten days, hindering the studies of young people and delaying the future of national construction. Thinking of this, I am deeply saddened. Our country has endured eight years of arduous war, sacrificing a great deal. Now that victory has just been realized, the opportunity for revival cannot be regained. It is right to work together with one heart and one mind, actively encouraging the work of national construction. However, rumors have spread and affected schools, leading to such unfortunate events. This is truly what pleases the enemy and saddens our loved ones. Schools are the backbone of society, and students are the foundation of national construction. The words and actions of schools and students should be models for society and are related to the lifeline of the country. They must distinguish right from wrong, recognize their responsibilities, value their studies, and abide by discipline. They must not let down the country's painstaking efforts to nurture them or violate the mission entrusted to them by the times. Chiang Kai-shek loves and protects young people as if they were his own children, and even more so because they are pure and innocent. Students have actions that harm themselves and the country. Although the War of Resistance has been won today, national affairs are difficult, and the people suffer. It is our inherent duty to maintain the stability of all order so that recovery and national construction are not hindered and the fruits of the War of Resistance can be preserved. Otherwise, I will have no way to face the heroic spirits of the martyrs who died in the War of Resistance and will betray the original intention of the teachers and students who endured hardships and relocations to support the War of Resistance. It is my duty to safeguard education and maintain discipline. I will definitely handle this incident fairly and responsibly based on right and wrong and the law, without any favoritism or leniency. However, the faculty of each school also bears a sacred responsibility to the school and the country. They should guide the students onto the right path and set an example for society. They must not allow the strike to continue and create a state of anarchy and disorder in schools and society, bringing shame to the country. At present, all problems must be resolved with the resumption of classes as a prerequisite and through normal procedures. Otherwise, no matter how much the government loves young people, it cannot abandon its duty to safeguard education and maintain order. I sincerely hope that the authorities and faculty of each school will deeply understand this intention and earnestly persuade all students to resume classes immediately and return to normalcy, and not let down my earnest expectations. Yours sincerely, Chiang Chung-cheng, December 7, 1945.

### Weng Wenhao Reports on the Situation of Taking Over and Handling Recovered Areas at the Resident Committee of the Political Council

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 7th] Weng Wenhao reported on the situation of taking over and handling various recovered areas at the resident committee of the Political Council on the 7th. The full text is as follows: Regarding the measures for handling enemy and puppet industries after the ceasefire, the central government has repeatedly formulated laws and regulations and has set standards for the division of labor among various agencies. Since Japan officially surrendered in August, the government has further stipulated various formal measures. The government first established special commissioner offices of various ministries in various regions as specialized management organizations for major sectors. It also established party and government takeover committees in various provinces and cities as joint consultation institutions. Subsequently, due to the need for further sorting and strengthening in the handling of various aspects, a national undertaking takeover committee was added to concentrate the promotion. The location of the committee was stipulated to be located at the headquarters of the Army General Headquarters to facilitate mutual liaison and adopt a unified attitude towards the Japanese side. In addition, enemy and puppet property handling bureaus were established in important areas, along with review committees, to concentrate the formulation of specific handling methods and ensure proper implementation. Among the handling institutions, the Shanghai area and the Hebei, Beijing, and Tianjin areas have been established and are actively handling matters. Areas still under preparation include the Shandong, Qingdao, Hunan, Hubei, Wuhan, and Guangdong areas. The Executive Yuan is actively supervising and earnestly carrying out the handling work in all these areas. The Executive Yuan has formally stipulated measures for handling enemy and puppet industries in the recovered areas, ordering various ministries, commissions, provinces, and cities to follow them. The content of these measures stipulates the specific standards for various agencies to take over, keep, and utilize, for example, military supplies are assigned to the Ministry of National Defense, warships are assigned to the Navy General Headquarters, land transportation tools are assigned to the Wartime Transportation Administration, water transportation tools are assigned to the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, and factory, mine equipment, raw materials, and finished products are assigned to the Ministry of Economic Affairs, real estate, houses, and furniture are assigned to the Central Trust of China, etc. On the other hand, the measures stipulate the principles for handling enemy and puppet assets. For industries that originally belonged to the people of our country or friendly nations and were indeed forcibly taken over by the Japanese side, evidence should be ascertained and returned to the original owners. For equity jointly owned by Chinese and Japanese puppets, all equity shall be transferred to the central government. For property originally owned by the Japanese or acquired by Japanese puppets, the property rights shall be transferred to the central government, and they will be allocated to the National Resources Commission, the Textile Industry Management Committee, or the Ministry of Food, depending on the nature. Those not within the scope of these allocations will be auctioned off at fair prices and transferred to private operation. The area handling bureaus and review committees will investigate the specific circumstances of each case, propose handling methods, and submit them to the Executive Yuan for approval and implementation in accordance with these measures. The work of taking over and handling is currently underway. The investigation and inquiry during the takeover revealed the actual ways in which Japan managed and controlled our country's economy during the war, showing the reality of their planning and utilization path. Generally speaking, it can be divided into two major periods: one is the Asia Development Board period, during which North China was placed under the jurisdiction of the Japanese Army, with army officers responsible for command in the center, and Central and South China were placed under the jurisdiction of the Japanese Navy, with naval officers leading in the center. The second is the Greater East Asia Ministry period, where the navy was no longer responsible, North China remained under the army, and Central and South China were guided by diplomats serving as ministers. As for the actual implementing agencies, the Central China Promotion Company (originally named Central China Promotion Co., Ltd.) and the North China Development Company (originally named North China Development Co., Ltd.) were the two mainstays. Both companies were Japanese legal entities established in accordance with Japanese law and were subject to the command and supervision of the Greater East Asia Ministry. The president and vice president were appointed by the Japanese government, and the directors were also subject to the instructions and approval of the Greater East Asia Ministry. The Central China Promotion Company had a capital of 100 million yen, and was authorized to issue bonds worth 500 million yen. From the establishment to the Japanese surrender, the company invested 150 million yen in Central China, accumulating to over 440 million yuan, and also ordered 45 billion yuan of puppet Central Reserve Bank notes for wartime necessities loans. The companies invested and organized by the Central China Promotion Company include: Central China Mining Company, with a capital of 4.5 billion yuan of puppet Central Reserve Bank notes; Central China Hydropower Company, with a capital of over 7.8 billion yuan; Central China Silk Company, with a capital of 1 billion yuan; Central China Aquatic Products Company, with a capital of 1.38 billion yuan; Central China Industrial Company, with a capital of 2 billion yuan; Central China Railway Company, with a capital of 47.5 billion yuan; Central China Electrical Communication Company, with a capital of 6 billion yuan; China Shipping Company, with a capital of 3 billion yuan; Shanghai Inland River Shipping Company, with a capital of 2.7 billion yuan; Shanghai Hengchan Company, with a capital of 3.75 billion yuan; Greater Shanghai Gas Company, with a capital of 900 million yuan; Central China Urban Public Bus Company, with a capital of 1.2 billion yuan; Huainan Coal Refining Company, with a capital of 4.15 billion yuan.

### National Army Advances Toward Chahar and Jehol; Shenyang Is Within Sight; Could Enter the City at Any Moment

[This Newspaper, Beiping, 7th] The National Army has begun to advance towards Chahar and Jehol. The Ping-Sui Railway line has advanced to Nankou, and the Ping-Je Railway line has crossed Miyun, approaching Gubeikou. The Soviet-Mongolian army in the Chahar and Jehol provinces has withdrawn, but there are still a few Soviet troops in northern Jehol and the Chahar border.

[This Newspaper News] According to Chongqing broadcast on the 7th, the Chinese Public Bulletin recently announced that the National Army has approached Shenyang, only 25 miles away. Before the military authorities of China and the Soviet Union complete negotiations, the National Army plans not to enter the city temporarily. The air force of the National Army has landed in Jinzhou.

[Associated Press, Chongqing, 7th] Today, well-informed sources said that after crossing the Liao River and occupying Xinglongdian, the National Army is now approaching Wanggutan, five miles west of Shenyang. It is also said that after occupying Xinmin, Xinglongdian became another target for the National Army to advance towards Shenyang.

[United Press, Chongqing, 7th] It is reported that the vanguard of the National Army has reached the outskirts of Shenyang and is expected to enter the city before the 10th of this month. The National Army swept 600 miles along the Beining Railway, encountering minor resistance from the Communist army, with no more than 100 National Army casualties.

[Central News Agency, Jinqi, 7th] Du Yuming left Jinzhou for Chongqing by plane at 9:00 a.m. on the 7th.

### Goubangzi and Jin County Regain Prosperity; The Communist Army's Plunder of All Residents Caused Extreme Resentment

[Central News Agency, Goubangzi, 7th] The vanguard of our army has crossed Goubangzi and reached villages around Liziwopu. This reporter took a train to Goubangzi on the morning of the 7th to inspect both sides of the railway. Our troops and civilians are repairing various facilities destroyed by the Communist army in the severe cold and strengthening defense work. Villages along the railway line have been looted by the Communist army and are in a state of disrepair. Upon arriving at Goubangzi Station, I went to inspect the town. According to the general public, our army has advanced rapidly, and fortunately, the town has not been destroyed. They deeply expressed their gratitude. The population of Goubangzi Town is over 30,000, and the living conditions of the people are better than those in Jinzhou. The city has returned to normal in just a few days since the National Army entered the city. The people live and work in peace and are on good terms with the National Army. However, important public and private properties, as well as gold and silver jewelry, have been looted by the Communist army. The people's resentment towards the Communist army's atrocities has reached an extreme point. The elderly said that they do not know when the private disasters they have suffered this time can be restored, and in the future, the local government will also assist the National Army with all its strength to establish permanent security. The Goubangzi Airport is of considerable scale and has not been destroyed, but more than 20 Japanese aircraft at the airport have been burned by the Communist army.

[Central News Agency, Beiping, 6th] Since General Du Yuming, Commander of the Northeast Security Command, arrived in Jin County on November 27, he has comforted the people, restored railway traffic, stabilized finance, and stabilized prices. Recently, great success has been achieved, and the market is becoming increasingly prosperous. According to reports: (1) There are about 70,000 to 80,000 National Communist troops led by Li Yunchang and Lin Biao between Qinhuangdao and Jinzhou. Last month, they hindered the National Army from proceeding to the Northeast in Guannei. After General Du personally led his troops to take over the defense from the Haiguan on November 16, the main force of the Communist army wavered. Lin Biao transferred the 132nd Division of the New Fourth Army to reinforce, but ultimately failed and fled into Jehol. West of Jin County, there are only sporadic Communist troops. According to reliable reports recently, Communist troops in various parts of the Northeast have surrendered. (2) The order in Dingzhou has now been fully restored, and merchants from neighboring counties such as Jinxi, Lianshan, and Xingcheng have come to Jin County to sell goods, and the market is extremely prosperous. (3) There are about 30,000 Japanese residents in Jinzhou, concentrated in the city. Japanese puppet women and children set up stalls to operate small businesses. Local living is 20 to 30 times cheaper than in Guannei. In terms of transportation, the Qin-Jin line has been opened to traffic. It is stipulated that there is one train between Shanhaiguan and Jinzhou every day, and passengers are extremely crowded. There is also a local train running between Shanhaiguan and Qinhuangdao, which is very convenient for travelers. (4) In terms of culture, General Du has always paid great attention to cultural undertakings and issues small mimeographed or lead-printed newspapers in the war zone. On the third day of entering Jin, he will issue the "New Life" eight-page lead-printed newspaper, which has sold about 20,000 copies in the past few days.

[Central News Agency, Jinzhou, 6th] The Jinzhou puppet Manchukuo operated a huge textile factory, which is now being taken over by the military and political department and renamed the military and political department textile factory. It has now started production.

The strategy for handling Inner Mongolia is being studied by the Design Bureau Mongolia Committee. Generally, local autonomy will be strengthened under the principle of national unity. The mixed-living and purely Mongolian areas of Inner Mongolia will also be divided in terms of administrative divisions. The Inner Mongolia People's Autonomous Government supported by the Communist Party has been renamed the Inner Mongolia People's Liberation Committee, and recently renamed the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Preparatory Committee, which is presided over by Mongolian Communist Party member Yun Ze.

### Huainan Railway Open to Traffic; Coal Shortage in Central China Can Be Solved

[This Newspaper, Chongqing, 7th] After the war, the Huainan Railway was rerouted by the enemy, with the starting point at Zhabu and the end point at Tianjia'an in Shou County. The stations passed through, such as Daqing and Jiulonggang, are all in the Huainan coal mining area. After the Japanese surrender, the road was heavily damaged by bandits, causing Huainan coal to be unable to be exported, which greatly affected transportation and industry in Central China. The Tenth War Zone Command has ordered the dispatch of its compiled troops to ensure the security along the route. Therefore, the Huainan Railway has been restored to traffic, and the coal shortage in various parts of Central China can be resolved.

### Editorial: The Fourth Anniversary of the Pacific War

Today is a day that all people around the world should not forget, especially the citizens of Shanghai. Four years ago today, the Japanese bandits launched a surprise attack on Pearl Harbor, initiating the Pacific War. While the Japanese bandits were digging their own graves in a frenzy, countless people around the world suffered the ravages of war as a result. Four years ago today, the Japanese bandits invaded the concessions in this city, not only becoming enemies with British and American expatriates but also completely depriving all Shanghai citizens of their freedom, treating them worse than slaves and livestock. As for our journalistic circles, from this day four years ago until the Japanese bandits surrendered this year, Shanghai had no free or independent speech. Therefore, Shanghai's journalists feel an even deeper and more painful recollection of today.

The Japanese chieftain Tojo launched the Pacific War, boasting it as the "Greater East Asia Holy War," starting with the surprise attack on Pearl Harbor, attacking the Philippines, occupying Singapore, invading Malaya, occupying the Dutch East Indies, knocking on the doors of Australia in the south, peeking through the windows of India in the west, controlling Hawaii with Guam in the east, and crossing the Kuril Islands in the north to approach Alaska, dominating the skies with an air of invincibility. However, in less than a year, they were defeated at the Coral Sea and then again at the Solomon Islands, which dampened their ferocious flames and changed the course of the war. Our great ally, the United States of America, under the successive leadership of Presidents Roosevelt and Truman, with the strategic planning of Marshal Marshall, the military preparations of Stimson, Knox, and others, the decisive victories from thousands of miles away by Generals Eisenhower, MacArthur, and others, and in close cooperation with China, Britain, and the Soviet Union, fought shoulder to shoulder for less than four years, achieving victory on both oceans, causing the Eastern and Western demons to perish together, and the three Axis powers of Germany, Italy, and Japan to surrender unconditionally one after another. Looking back from today, the Pacific War was not only a "masterpiece" of the Japanese bandits digging their own graves but also a prelude to the collapse of the entire anti-democratic, aggressive nations. After the victory, as we encounter this startling and alarming day for the first time, we should first pay our infinite respect and condolences to the tens of thousands of Allied soldiers who bravely sacrificed themselves. The leaders of the four major Allied powers, China, the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union, through their arduous and exceptional leadership and close, seamless cooperation, enabled the Allied forces of the democratic nations to finally achieve unprecedented victory, truly writing an indelible page in history.

The one who outwardly launched the Pacific War was Tojo, but in reality, it was Konoe. Konoe Fumimaro first formed a cabinet on June 1, 1937, succeeding Hayashi Senjuro, and just over a month later, he launched the July 7th Incident, initiating a full-scale invasion of China. His ambition was to follow Tanaka Giichi's strategy, conquering Manchuria and Mongolia to conquer China, and then conquering the world. The ambition of "Hakkō ichiu" (all the world under one roof) was the real cause of his launching the war against China. Although he once resigned, he became a remarried woman (a phrase meaning to return to a previous occupation) on July 17, 1940, succeeding Yonai Mitsumasa. After a year, the government collapsed, but he formed a cabinet for the third time. This should not be seen merely as Konoe being opportunistic but rather because he always妄圖貫徹查想 to implement the so-called "Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere" policy, wanting to start with "establishing a highly wartime system" as a method for further expanding aggression. Both his second and third cabinets had Tojo Hideki as the Army Minister, which shows that Tojo was the backbone of the Konoe Cabinet and the soul of Konoe's cabinet formation. The third Konoe Cabinet was in power for less than three months before it was transferred to Tojo. Tojo formed a cabinet in less than two months, and the great fire of the Pacific War erupted, becoming unstoppable like a prairie fire. This shows even more that Tojo's reckless actions were pioneered by Konoe. Konoe accumulated the firewood, and Tojo fanned the flames; like a flood, Konoe opened the sluice gates, and Tojo destroyed the dams. At the beginning of his three cabinet formations, Konoe himself declared his mission, saying something like, "The immutable national policy of the Empire has long been established, and today there is only one path: to rapidly move toward decisiveness." What was the immutable national policy? It was to conquer China and then conquer the world. What was rapid decisiveness? It was to act recklessly regardless of the consequences. Tojo truly and wholeheartedly inherited this mantle from him. Therefore, the culprit of the war of aggression against China was indeed Konoe, and the culprit who launched the surprise attack on Pearl Harbor in the Pacific War was, besides Tojo, still Konoe. However, after the Japanese bandits surrendered, Tojo was arrested early on, while Konoe still wanted to pretend to be "democratic," posing as a moderate and stable figure, seemingly earnestly undertaking the work of revising the Japanese Constitution for the Emperor Hirohito, which was truly shameless. On the eve of the fourth anniversary of the Pacific War, we heard that Marshal MacArthur had ordered the arrest of Konoe and Kido, charging them with war crimes, which was indeed a gratifying piece of news.

We ourselves do not harbor the slightest narrow-minded desire for revenge, and we do not hope that there will be so-called irreconcilable "blood feuds" between people in the world. However, after a cruel war that killed millions of people, we cannot but settle the responsibility for the war. In the Pacific War, the global anti-aggression war, our democratic nations achieved a glorious victory. We can be lenient towards the innocent people of the enemy country and use education to make them a peaceful and benevolent nation again, but we must have a strict punishment for the warlords, bureaucrats, and politicians of the enemy country who launched the war, as well as the traitors and national scoundrels who flattered the enemy and betrayed the country. Otherwise, we will have no way to answer to the sacrificed soldiers, let alone to the people who have suffered greatly.

Finally, in order to ensure that there will never be such a cruel war in the world again, the four major Allied powers of China, the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union, as well as all the united nations, need to cooperate with the same sincerity and seamlessness in peacetime as they did in wartime. Only then can we hope that the Pacific will be permanently peaceful and that war will forever leave us!

### United States Proposes Convening a Worldwide Trade Conference Next Summer; Collective Action to Prevent Economic Warfare

[US News Agency Washington 6th] The US government is urging countries around the world to convene an international trade conference in the first half of next year to promote trade and employment. The State Department announced today that Secretary of State Byrnes has sent a proposal for holding such a conference to various governments. The preface to this document was written by Byrnes himself, and the original text is as follows:

The recommendations in this booklet were drafted by US experts in cooperation under the direction of Assistant Secretary of State Clayton and are intended for the reference of the American people and the governments and peoples of other countries in preparation for the convening of an international trade and employment conference. The meeting based on the recommendations in this booklet should be held as soon as possible. Countries are now considering the trade policies to be adopted after the war, and these policies urgently need to reach mutual agreement to prevent the world from being divided into several economic groups. Therefore, the US government firmly believes that this conference convened by the United Nations should be held no later than the summer of 1946, and the US representatives serving in the United Nations agencies will do their utmost to achieve this.

[United Press Washington 6th] The US government announced yesterday the Anglo-American loan agreement, and at the same time, it released a white paper strongly opposing high tax rates, trade preferences, and monopolies. It proposed that negotiations should begin before the international conference is held, to universally reduce tariffs and remove other barriers, as a collective action to prevent economic warfare is necessary to supplement the efforts of the United Nations to prevent military warfare.

### India Clarifies its Attitude Toward the British Labour Government's Declaration; Points Out That This is Merely a Disguised Version of the Cripps Proposals; Without a Change in British Policy, Order Will Ultimately be Difficult to Restore

[Reuters London 7th] A spokesman for the Indian League, Krishna, claimed yesterday that it was regrettable that the British Labour government's declaration did not mention India's independence and self-government. We believe that the Indian problem arises from the flaws in British policy itself, not from any misunderstanding by the Indians of that policy. Moreover, this declaration is merely a reiteration of the Cripps proposals, without any historically forward-looking action, which is truly disappointing. If the Labour government is wise, it should immediately change its current policy and establish an administrative organ trusted by the people, so that law and order can be relied upon to be restored. The Indian people feel that this British government's declaration is particularly unsuited to the current stage of India. The declaration does not even touch on the situation of the Indian elections.

### Pauley Presents Proposals for Japanese Reparations

[United Press Tokyo 7th] American reparations commissioner Pauley stated that he has recommended to President Truman that all of Japan's foreign assets, as well as most of its chemical, steel, and shipbuilding capabilities, be confiscated, and that the power and machinery industries be reduced by half, so that Japan will not be able to rebuild for war. The countries that have suffered can simultaneously be compensated. Some of this industrial equipment can be dismantled and shipped to other countries, which would be welcomed by China and the Philippines. All of Japan's gold and precious metals can be sent to the San Francisco Mint for temporary storage, and the disposal method will be discussed later. What Japan has left can be used to help other countries in Asia that lack it, which can improve the latter's standard of living. This work must begin as soon as shipping becomes convenient.

### Recounting Sixty-Four Crimes, Yamashita Tomoyuki Sentenced to Hang; First Batch of Japanese War Criminals Scheduled to be Tried Next Month; Keenan Advocates Strict Punishment to Prevent Recurrence of War

[Reuters Manila 7th] Yamashita Tomoyuki, former commander-in-chief of the Japanese army stationed in the Philippines, was accused of committing sixty-four crimes. After nearly six weeks of trial, he was sentenced to death today. Before the verdict was announced, Yamashita said, "I stand here, asking myself with a clear conscience, I can swear to God that I am innocent." When he was escorted back after hearing the verdict, he seemed somewhat distracted. The courtroom was crowded today. Major General Reynold資, Chairman of the War Crimes Commission, announced the judgment for thirteen minutes, stating briefly, "The committee concludes that your subordinates have committed serious atrocities and other crimes throughout the Philippines, and these are not intermittent occurrences, but mostly organized supervision and implementation. You failed to effectively control your subordinates, so after a secret written vote, the committee decided that you are indeed guilty and sentenced to hanging." The defendant's lawyer sent an appeal to the US Supreme Court by airmail this morning, requesting a review of the case.

[United Press Tokyo 7th] MacArthur's special advisor Keenan declared today: Japanese war criminals must be punished and humiliated so that future generations will see them as ordinary and most lowly criminals. It is essential to punish these leaders now, because we are now facing a third war, and there is a risk of fundamentally losing our culture, so we have to take action. Keenan declined to answer the question of the United Nations' attitude towards Emperor Hirohito of Japan. The large number of war suspects will be tried in batches by courts appointed by MacArthur, and other countries will be invited to appoint judges to participate. The arrest warrants for Konoe and Kido and the appointment of Chief Prosecutor Keenan today have made the Japanese people fully aware that the United Nations is seriously prosecuting Japanese war criminals. This order has included all war criminals close to the throne, leaving only the Japanese Emperor himself not arrested. The release of this order will have extremely serious consequences for domestic politics in Japan. Japan itself should also investigate the process of leading people to war.

[Central News Agency Tokyo 7th Special Dispatch] Keenan told reporters: All countries concerned have been invited to participate in the war crimes trials that are about to begin in Tokyo, and all rights of other countries will also be respected during the trials.

### Pearl Harbor Incident Investigation Committee; Marshall Attends and Testifies; Chiang Kai-shek Asked the United States for Assistance a Month Before the Japanese Surprise Attack on Pearl Harbor

[Central News Agency Washington 6th Special Dispatch] China once again occupied a prominent position in this investigation as Marshall testified before the Congressional Pearl Harbor Incident Investigation Committee today. When answering questions, Marshall said: Chiang Kai-shek asked the United States for assistance in early November 1941, fearing that the Japanese army would attack Kunming and the Yunnan-Burma Road. When asked what he did at the time, Marshall replied: He did not agree to send US troops to China, nor did he issue an ultimatum to Japan.

However, he did not remember whether this warning was issued. Marshall also said: He could speak Chinese and had served in China for three years.

### American Industrial Secrets to be Sold Abroad at a Price

[United Press Washington, 6th] It is heard that American "industrial secrets" will be sold abroad at a price. A number of retired officials, bankers, and industrialists here are planning to establish branches in Britain, South Africa, India, and various parts of Europe under the name of "Overseas Company." The Australian office has already been established. The company's business policy is to assist American manufacturers in providing industrial technology and manufacturing methods to foreign countries, and to import foreign manufacturing methods suitable for use in the United States. For example, steel mills destroyed in foreign countries during the war can learn about the latest methods and uses of American mass steelmaking. Film companies can learn about the latest manufacturing, management, and distribution techniques in Hollywood. The manufacturing of automobiles, trucks, airplanes, washing machines, electrical appliances, etc., can also be exchanged at extremely low prices for the knowledge accumulated by American industry in the past twenty years, especially during the war, such as management organization, efficiency, manufacturing, and sales. As for the fee standard, it has not yet been determined and will be based on the following two factors: (1) the type of industry, the work done, and the length of service; (2) the paying ability, profits earned, and future prospects of the benefiting company, and the value of the exchange service to the American company.

### Hong Kong University, the Only British University in the Far East - A Perspective

— Leda Guan

Britain has three directly governed colonial universities: one is the University of Malta, established in 1769, one is the University of Gibraltar, established in 1925, and the other is Hong Kong University.

Hong Kong University was founded in 1907 by Sir Frederick Lugard, Governor of Hong Kong, and officially established in 1911. Its purpose, it is said, was to adapt to the new trends of thought in the world and to provide the young Chinese in Hong Kong with new knowledge.

Initially, the Hong Kong government donated 1.7 million Hong Kong dollars (approximately 200,000 pounds). Later, Sir Paul Chater, a wealthy American in Hong Kong, donated 26,000 pounds, the Rockefeller Foundation, an American oil tycoon, donated 80,000 pounds, and Messers John Swire & Sons donated 40,000 pounds, all of which were designated as the Hong Kong University Fund and deposited in the bank to generate interest. The annual interest on this fund, HK$369,260, together with the British government's annual subsidy of HK$350,000, was used as the university's annual expenses.

Before the war, Hong Kong University had three colleges: Arts, Engineering, and Commerce. The Arts and Engineering colleges were completed in four years, and the elective courses were limited to six years. Co-education was practiced. Each student paid HK$400 per year for tuition and HK$300 for room and board. At that time, the fees were considered too expensive, becoming aristocratic, and unaffordable for the younger siblings of wealthy or middle-class families. Of the 400 male and female students in the university, most were from Hong Kong or Guangdong, and many were sent to study by the children of overseas Chinese from the Malay Peninsula and other parts of Southeast Asia.

As for the school buildings, in addition to classrooms and various offices, there were six male dormitories and one female dormitory, as well as a large library with 80,000 volumes, almost half of which were Chinese books.

Hong Kong has a mild climate, with spring-like weather all year round. Because it is located on the route to Southeast Asia and is also one of the world's best naval ports, the university grasped the authority of the British Far East naval base and enhanced its international status. On December 8, 1941, when the Pacific War broke out, Hong Kong was tragically captured, and it is heard that the university also suffered considerable losses.

Now that the war is over, the National Government will resolve the Hong Kong issue through diplomatic means. It is not known what the future status of Hong Kong University, the only British university in the Far East, will be.

### Amendment to the Regulations for Punishing Traitors; Changes in Penalties; Appeals Allowed Against Judgments

[Special Report from This City] Amidst the nationwide demand for the swift prosecution of traitors, the Regulations for Punishing Traitors have been revised and promulgated. Our reporter interviewed Xiang Zherong, Chief Prosecutor of the Second Branch of the Shanghai High Court, to inquire about his opinion on these regulations.

Mr. Xiang immediately pointed out that after the revision of the regulations, there was a significant change, that is, the original regulations stipulated that the penalties for punishing traitors were only death penalty and life imprisonment. Now, for those with lighter circumstances, a fixed-term imprisonment of more than five years may be imposed. When handling traitor cases, in addition to the regulations, the Emergency Law for Punishing Crimes Endangering the Republic of China, the Criminal Law, or other laws may also be applied. However, if there is a conflict in the provisions of each law, Mr. Xiang stated that the principle of "later law prevails over earlier law" should be followed, and the latest promulgated law should be adopted. As for how to deal with foreigners who collude with the enemy or rebel, Mr. Xiang said that before the Anti-Japanese War, the Soviet Union and Germany had abandoned consular jurisdiction. Later, when the United Kingdom and the United States signed new treaties, they also expressed their abandonment of this privilege. Therefore, if the nationals of these countries commit criminal acts, they should also be dealt with by our courts. Currently, the number of traitor cases transferred by the arresting agencies to the prosecutor's office of the High Court is only about 40. About seven or eight cases have been disposed of. Except for a part that is not prosecuted due to insufficient evidence of crime, about four or five cases have been filed for public prosecution. The reporter also inquired with Mr. Xiang about the rumor that defendants in traitor cases were not allowed to enjoy the right to legal representation during trial. Mr. Xiang replied that there was no such provision and that defendants could also appeal to the Supreme Court if they disagreed with the judgment.

Ding Guanping, a Traitor, Tried Yesterday

Ding Guanping, the former "Chairman of the Food Management Committee of the Puppet Ministry of Food," was arrested by the authorities and detained for more than a month. He was publicly tried by the Second Criminal Court of the Second Branch of the High Court yesterday morning at 10:00 AM. Judge Sun Pengxian inquired about his age and origin. Ding replied that he was 40 years old, from Hangzhou. When asked why he participated in the puppet organization, Ding excused himself by saying that transportation was blocked and he was burdened by his family. Asked how long he had served in the "Ministry of Food," he replied that he had served as "Chairman of the Food Management Committee" since its establishment on December 8, 1941, until he resigned in March 1943. On February 21, 1945, he served as the "Warden of the Detention Center of the Local Prosecutor's Office." Asked whether he had harmed Chinese people during his tenure, he replied that when he was in the "Ministry of Food," the rice in various districts of Yangzhou was only used for the local people. When he was the warden of the detention center, he tried to ensure that the prisoners had sufficient food. Because the documents submitted by Ding were mostly forged, the judge asked how much property he had in total. He replied that his assets were worth 40 to 50 million yuan in puppet currency. The court ordered further investigation and adjourned the hearing to be held again in seven days.

### Du Yuesheng Broadcast Last Night; Supporting Chairman Chiang's Economic Construction Policy

From 7:45 PM to 8:00 PM yesterday, Mr. Du Yuesheng, Chairman of the Shanghai Local Association, gave a speech at the Shanghai Radio Station at the invitation of the Central Broadcasting Administration Office, entitled "Supporting Chairman Chiang's Economic Construction Policy."

Mr. Du first said that he had been missing his elders and fellow villagers for eight years. During his stay in Chongqing, he engaged in economic and financial undertakings under the premise of resisting Japan and building the nation. He once inspected the Northwest and felt that it was in urgent need of development. At the beginning of June of this year, he discussed with Chairman Chiang and went to the Southeast to take up his work. He left Chongqing on June 25 and arrived in Chun'an, Zhejiang on July 16. On August 11, the Japanese surrendered. He returned to Shanghai on September 3.

Chairman's Instructions Emphasize Support

Recently, Chairman Chiang announced the economic policies for the period of national construction and established the Supreme Economic Council. The goal revealed in Chairman Chiang's instructions is to implement the Principle of People's Livelihood and do everything possible to restore domestic order and security. From Chairman Chiang's instructions, we can find that the government will improve transportation, cultivate talents, and correct bad habits for industry and commerce. For agriculture, it will reduce land rent and usury to improve the lives of farmers. Other measures, such as stabilizing the currency system and encouraging foreign trade, are concrete ways to realize the policy. The principles revealed by President Song emphasize that the government should support the people in developing the economy. We should do our best within the scope of the government's economic policies under the guidance of Chairman Chiang and President Song, in order to achieve self-reliance. Shanghai, which has always been the leader in industry and commerce nationwide, should unanimously support it.

Hurry Up Production and Do Not Stop

I also have a small opinion. After eight years of devastation and destruction by the enemy, the losses are incalculable. It will take more than ten or twenty years to recover. Therefore, after the victory, we must hurry up production and not allow any short-term stagnation. It is heard that in North China alone, a one-day work stoppage results in a loss of 600 million yuan. This is a huge figure. How can we tolerate such a significant loss?

Shanghai Prices Are Falling Consistently

In addition, regarding the prices in this city, I would like to report: In Chairman Chiang's instructions to the Supreme Economic Council, the phrase "do everything possible to restore domestic order and security" also includes the issue of prices. From the perspective of construction, being active is building, and being passive is stabilization. Since President Song's visit to Shanghai, the mayor and relevant authorities have tried to stabilize prices. Liu, the bureau chief, has quickly handled the sealed materials and gradually released them. The various industries in Shanghai have also been able to uphold the Chairman's virtues and have been able to persuade each other. Therefore, prices have recently fallen consistently. It can be seen that with the government leading from above and the people cooperating from below, the effect is doubled with half the effort.

Universally Comply with Fairness, Justice, and Integrity

In short, the post-war period is more difficult than the war period. At this time, we must not only learn from our pain, but also accept the suffering that must be experienced in the period of national construction with a spirit of great selflessness. Chairman Chiang also said in his instructions to the Supreme Economic Council, "What is needed at this time is that all public and private life must be absolutely fair, just, and honest. This is an important moment in our history. We must absolutely not tolerate slow, corrupt, or selfish people who exploit the people in order to seek personal wealth." These words are certainly intended to encourage those in power, but we citizens should also take them as a lesson and universally comply with them. I am willing to encourage myself with you all.

### US Military Police Pay Attention to Military Accidents

[Special Report from Our Newspaper] Recently, US military trucks and jeeps in this city have often caused accidents. Colonel Brown of the US Military Police told our reporter yesterday that the US military headquarters is also paying close attention to this incident and has already established rules for vehicle driving. The speed of each vehicle must not exceed 15 miles per hour. Violators will be suspended from driving for 30 days. If there are injuries or other incidents, in addition to compensating for the losses, they must also be subject to military court martial. As for the hired drivers, if they violate the rules, they can be reported to the Police Bureau and transferred to the US Military Police for investigation. They may be dismissed immediately, or handed over to the Municipal Police Bureau for investigation, or ordered to compensate for the losses.

Colonel Brown also said that the most difficult thing at present is reporting the accident vehicle without knowing the number, which makes the investigation very difficult. Therefore, he hopes that in the future, if a vehicle accident occurs, those who witness it should immediately record the number and report it to the Military Police Team on Chengdu Road or the Military Police Headquarters on Hamiloden Road on Jiangxi Road, so that an investigation can be carried out. On the one hand, he has repeatedly warned the drivers to be careful and there are slogans posted on each vehicle to alert them.

### Hong's Conversation

According to Vice Minister Hong, "Mr. Lan is here in Shanghai on the order of President Song, to meet with municipal authorities to handle relief for unemployed workers and to discuss the resumption of factory operations. He also needs to go to Beijing soon to inspect the original National Assembly Hall construction. The Central Government attaches great importance to the resumption of operations of factories in Shanghai and the stability of workers. The problem of worker unemployment is particularly concerning to the central authorities at the beginning of this recovery. President Chiang and President Song are particularly concerned about this. After my arrival in Shanghai, I will discuss solutions to this problem with the relevant authorities, and I hope that all prominent figures will provide guidance." It is said that Mr. Hong will stay in Shanghai for several days before going to Beijing.

### Dai Gengxin Returns to Shanghai; Talks About Cigarette Factory Resumption; Small Factories Allowed to Register

[Special Report by this Newspaper] Mr. Dai Gengxin, a representative of cigarette factories in Shanghai, went to Chongqing in the middle of last month to discuss issues related to Shanghai cigarette factories with the central authorities. He has now returned to Shanghai in recent days. According to Mr. Dai, during his discussions with President Song and relevant officials in Chongqing, the results were very satisfactory. It is said that President Song has agreed that more than two hundred small factories in Shanghai can register with the government in accordance with the law and be allowed to continue operations. Mr. Dai stated to President Song that the proliferation of hand-rolled cigarettes is affecting the sales of factory-made cigarettes. It has now been decided to raise the tax rate on hand-rolled cigarettes to one hundred percent, equal to the tax rate on factory-made cigarettes. As for the three major cigarette factories in Shanghai (Nanyang, Yizhong, and Huacheng), they are all facing difficulties due to major problems such as raw materials and transportation, and it will be difficult to resume operations within two or three months. The government will do its best to assist within the possible range, so that they can resume operations as soon as possible.

### Social Services: General Electric Edison Factory: Factory Appeals for Relief

To the Editor: We are workers who have served at the General Electric Edison Light Bulb Factory for more than ten years. Since the outbreak of the Pacific War, the factory has been occupied by Japanese invaders. Some of the workers were laid off by the factory at that time and have been struggling for four years. In order to obtain the righteous victory of the War of Resistance, we have lingered and moaned in the depths of despair, living an inhuman life. Fortunately, our supreme leader, with his fearless spirit, has overcome the tyranny of power, and the light of victory has illuminated the whole country. Every person is celebrating the victory with joy. Our workers were dissatisfied with the flag-raising celebration by the agent of the factory (Danish nationality), and the general manager ordered a strike. As a result, after mediation by the authorities, our workers, for the sake of the country's future and the entire society, have always silently endured and accepted the conditions of the capitalists. Each worker received 250 pairs of light bulbs as severance pay. The factory manager certified that it was not a separation from Edison, and hoped that the workers would wait patiently and quietly, and that they would resume work in at most a week. Sir, please think, it has been more than two months now. The mere 250 light bulbs have long been sold for a pittance for daily living. Under the current social living conditions, what kind of life are our workers living? However, in this situation where we have "no way to go to heaven and no way to enter the earth," we are grateful that the authorities do not abandon us and convened two talks between labor and management. As a result, the factory twice refused to attend. If this continues, hundreds of our workers will become war victims. (Omitted) We have no choice but to implore you, sir, to appeal to the society on behalf of our hundreds of workers. I think that the wise authorities and righteous people who care about the people's suffering, hearing the cries for help from our compatriots who are about to starve to death, will surely use their righteous spirit to rescue the starving people in difficulty. Sincerely, All Workers Representatives of General Electric Edison Light Bulb Factory, Wang Xinhe, et al.

### One-Way Traffic on Jiujiang Road and Hankou Road Implemented Today

In order to avoid traffic congestion on Jiujiang Road and Hankou Road, the Shanghai Police Department and the Shanghai Public Utilities Bureau will implement one-way traffic from December 8th. The procedures are as follows: (1) Open Jiujiang Road and Hankou Road specifically for vehicles traveling westward and eastward. All types of vehicles traveling on Jiujiang Road should travel westward, and vehicles traveling on Hankou Road should travel eastward. (Vehicles with passengers, except motor vehicles) may travel on the aforementioned roads. Unladen vehicles on the aforementioned roads should follow specific regulations and travel to the nearest intersection. (The effective time for the above one-way traffic procedure is from 8:00 AM to 6:00 PM every morning.) (2) Manage motor vehicle parking regulations on Jiujiang Road and Hankou Road. All types of motor vehicles parked on Jiujiang Road (from the Bund to Xizang Road) should be parked on the north side of the road, facing west.

### Four Years Ago Today: A Recollection of a Record of Blood and Tears

In this newspaper published early in the morning four years ago today, there was a small piece of final news that said: "At about 4:30 this morning, there was a sudden sound of artillery fire from the east end of the Huangpu River. After about a quarter of an hour, black smoke rose in the sky, mixed with the sound of machine guns. Residents were awakened from their dreams..."

The dawn of the 8th was still dark, and intense artillery fire suddenly erupted on the tranquil Huangpu River. The British warship "Petrel" became a victim of the "sneak attack" by the Japanese garrison in Shanghai. The American gunboat "Wake," anchored nearby, realizing that the situation was over, peacefully raised the white flag. This was the prelude to the Japanese garrison in Shanghai entering the concessions that day.

At around 10:00 AM, batches of Japanese troops from Hongkou passed through the Sichuan Road Bridge, heading towards the Suzhou Creek. All important public utilities, military and government agencies, and all agencies deemed necessary to occupy were seized and closed by them in one or two hours. Then, imposing announcements from the Japanese army and navy were posted all over the city.

Initially, some people suspected that the sounds of guns and artillery on the Huangpu River were an exercise, but later it became clear that this was wrong. The so-called "imperial army" occupying the concessions was already everywhere.

That night in Shanghai, in contrast to the past prosperity and luxury, everything became silent and eerie, making people shudder.

Early in the morning of the third day (the 10th). Around nine o'clock, the banks opened one after another, but it was a flash in the pan, and they closed their doors again an hour later. After that, business hours were reduced to three hours a day, with a limit of 500 yuan for each household's withdrawals and deposits. The market temporarily came to a standstill, and Shanghai's small economic circle was completely under the control of the devil's claws.

Along with this, there was a major panic over rice. "Where can rice be bought?" Almost everyone was asking this question. To buy two liters of rice, they almost had to risk their lives to struggle.

Following the shortage of grain came a severe shortage of fuel. Coal and coal balls were restricted from transportation from the 10th, and all gasoline in the city was sealed off one after another. From the 12th, the operating hours of buses were shortened, and the number of streetcar trips was also reduced accordingly. Xiang Sheng, Yun Fei, Tai Lai, and Silver, the four major taxi companies, all stopped operating from the 13th, and all private cars were soon prohibited from driving. All of this was nothing more than the enemy's attempt to plunder some of the remaining fuel and paralyze the entire city's transportation.

This endless record of blood and tears can be said to be unbearable to recount. This newspaper, due to its "advocacy of resistance against Japan," had long been noticed by the Japanese army. After the Japanese army occupied the concessions, taking over this newspaper was expected. Unexpectedly, the Japanese army came to this building with a full complement of assault equipment, as if facing a major enemy. This building, without hesitation, announced its glorious suspension of publication with the first edition of the "24337" newspaper published that day (the 8th). However, at the time of suspension, we shared the firm belief of the general public of Shanghai that the victory of the motherland's resistance war was one step closer, and that the restoration of Shanghai would be quick to follow. Our glorious resumption of publication was just around the corner. Now, as expected, the War of Resistance has been won, and this newspaper also resumed its publication on the 22nd of last month with the "24338" issue. However, the future of nation-building and the revitalization of Shanghai still require redoubled efforts! (Canglong)

### Gunfire in This Port This Morning

At approximately 4:30 AM this morning, there was a sudden sound of gunfire originating from the east end of the Huangpu River. After about a quarter of an hour, black smoke rose in the sky, mixed with the sound of machine guns. Many residents were awakened from their dreams. Details were still unclear at the time of printing.

The笛聲of every輪船sailing東下引起無數的嘆息. Those眼光遠望着故鄕and cannot購得一紙船票weaves多少幅焦急失望的圖景in the 江水on遠雲.

The黃金案stirring the mountain city is being偵查法辦, and at the gate of 中國銀行,夜以待旦's買金者's行列 have appeared again. 黃金案's犯人have fallen into法網了. But these在一萬元一夜僱人站排買大量黃金People are幾百萬几百萬的Increasing their資產!

失業的人數is日漸增多, and on the南岸 there have been聚衆白食的失業者. 物價is still膠滯着at that high昂的指數上. 安分守己的公務人員们have not展開過笑臉.

All of this adds to the沉重的氣氛among the people in the山城.

### Round and Square

— Tradition First

The more one lives, the more one feels that being a person is difficult, especially in today's Chinese society. If you are too upright, you will not be able to succeed in everything, and people will be annoyed by you. If you are too smooth, people will say that you are not sincere and will not trust you in everything. However, generally speaking, in today's Chinese society, being round is easier to succeed than being square. "Being round" means that as long as you are smooth, you can go everywhere without encountering obstacles. It's like a round ball, even if there is an obstacle in the way, it can still roll past it. "Being square" means that if you do things too squarely, you will be asked to stand at attention at any time. When we throw a square block of wood on the ground, it will at most roll once or twice and then stop moving. This society does not seem to trust smooth people, but welcomes smoothness everywhere and is overcome by smoothness everywhere.

There is a type of person who is smooth and considerate in their bones, but pretends to be serious. This is what is called "round inside and square outside." This type of person is the most cunning and harsh. Generally speaking, it is easy to dodge a spear in the open, but difficult to defend against an arrow in the dark. This type of person specializes in shooting cold arrows. Most people suffer the most from them, but they like them the most. People like to engage in this type of drinking poison to quench thirst. They love the superficial uprightness of this type of person, and they love even more the comfortable smoothness in the bones that makes people unable to describe.

There is also a type of person who is "square inside and round outside." They appear to be very smooth on the outside, but inside they have a principle of being a person that they hold on to. This type of person uses constancy to respond to all changes. They can adapt to various environments, but once they encounter something that violates their principle of being a person, they can unhesitatingly counterattack. This type of person is not easy to be, because the roundness of the exterior often wears away the squareness of their hearts, and they also become round, and in the end they become smooth both inside and out. Conversely, when the heart is square, it is often expressed externally, which often makes the roundness of the exterior also sprout corners, becoming a person who is square and unyielding both inside and out, and this in turn will make this society dislike them. To be a person, to be round, one must be round just right, and to be square, one must also be square appropriately. This is truly difficult.

### Successful Heart Transplant Experiment

— Wang Yanxiang

The experiment of transplanting the heart of warm-blooded animals such as rabbits, cats, and dogs has been successfully researched by Professor Nikolai Sinlitsin of the Moscow Gorky Medical Research Institute.

Professor Xin first transplanted the animal's heart to the neck and then connected it to its blood system. As a result, there were no adverse effects. Professor Xin is now conducting a long-term experiment to enable animals to have two hearts and live as long as possible. At the same time, he and his assistants are experimenting with transplanting the heart into the animal's abdomen.

This work will be of extremely valuable help in the fields of cardiac physiology and cardiology.

In a report to the Soviet Anti-Fascist Scientific Association, Professor Xin said: The transplanted heart usually beats slightly slower than the original heart. Rabbits, cats, dogs, etc. can easily tolerate this transplant surgery. They only lose a small amount of blood, and the heart's action has no reaction on them. The operated animals do not have symptoms such as shortness of breath, convulsions, or excessive excitement, and they also have normal responses to external stimuli such as light, sound, and pain.

Before transplanting the heart of warm-blooded animals, Professor Xin first transplanted the heart of cold-blooded vertebrates. He used a frog's heart to replace another frog's heart. Many frogs can live for more than six months with the transplanted heart. In the spring, the operated male and female frogs are still able to go through a normal mating period and lay eggs.

Professor Xin described the experiment with frogs, saying that when tested with a microscope, it can be seen that the sutured blood vessels are completely tight, and the structure of the heart is also very normal.

When two hearts beat together in the chest of a frog, they have different relationships with the animal's body. The heart itself has a neutral and harmonious relationship with the blood, while the transplanted heart only has a harmonious and North-learning relationship within the first thirty-five to forty days. After that, nerves gradually grow onto the newly transplanted heart. It is also possible to use cardiac drugs to test the reaction of a living thing that has two hearts.

How long can the transplanted heart ultimately replace the original organism? Also, when animal nerves grow on the new heart, what effect will the heart's own nerves have?

Professor Xin will use the results of the experiment with cold-blooded animals to test rabbits, cats, dogs, etc. He discovered a method of connecting the blood vessels of warm-blooded animals, which is very simple and can be completed in twenty or thirty seconds.

In the first step of the experiment, Professor Xin transplanted the heart to the animal's head, but only the right half of the second heart was connected to the animal's blood vessels, and the left half could not circulate, so this surgery is called the "half-treatment method."

After many observations, it can be seen that the heart works well and can survive for a long time. Although the heart retains its own rhythm, it has no abnormal effect on blood pressure and working ability.

In the second step of the experiment, when Professor Xin transplanted the heart to the neck, he connected both halves of it to the arteries and veins. From this experiment, he invented a complete heart, which he called the "pathological transplanted" heart.

### The Enemy (The Bnemy)

— Pearl S. Buck, translated by Zhu Qi

The general replied, "I don't trust any of them. The best ones were all trained in Germany. Even if I die during surgery, they would still think the operation was a success. I don't want to hear their opinions." He sighed and said, "It's a pity we can't mix the recklessness of Germany with the softheartedness of America. That way, you could bring your prisoner to justice, and I could rest assured that you wouldn't assassinate me while I was unconscious." The general laughed. He had an extraordinary sense of humor. He asked, "As a Japanese man, can you mix these two foreign elements?"

Zhenxiong smiled, "I'm not sure myself, but for your sake, I am willing to try, sir."

The general shook his head, he said, "I'd rather not be the test subject." He suddenly felt weak and thought only of his own life. During this succession of victories, the responsibility of an officer for the entire South Pacific is very heavy. He got angry and said, "It's bad luck that this person would be washed up on your doorstep."

Zhenxiong said gently, "I think so too."

The general said, "It's best to kill him quietly. Not by you, but by someone who doesn't know him. I have my own assassins. Or I'll send two people tonight—or preferably any night. You don't need to know anything. Now that it's getting warmer—if you leave the doors and windows on the garden side of the white man's room open, that would be the most natural thing to do."

Zhenxiong agreed, "Of course, that is very natural. In fact, the doors and windows are open every night."

The general yawned and said, "Good. They are very capable assassins—they make no noise and know the secret of internal bleeding. If you like, I can have them move the body."

Zhenxiong thought for a moment, thinking of Hanako, and agreed, "That would probably be best, sir." Commercial News

### Gold Market Trends Stable, Rice Prices Rebound

Stock Trading Gradually Becomes Quiet

Gold: Yesterday, the overall trend gradually stabilized. Although there were still disturbances at noon, the shorts covered as soon as prices fell, resulting in a relatively stable situation, roughly the same as the previous close. In fact, apart from various merchants selling physical goods, speculators were wary at this low price. The general psychological perception is still that the exchange rate between US dollars and gold is based on an unwritten rule of six hundred to ten taels. Even if the US dollar is quoted at one thousand to one, the price of gold can still reach 600,000 due to arbitrage. Although the shorts are constantly increasing pressure, the situation has gradually stabilized due to purchases by banks. In the future, it is feared that it will still be a sideways market. Silverware was retreated to 74,000 yesterday, refined silver 650, silver dollars are still below 460, and underground discounts are about 10-13%.

Foreign Exchange: Continued to be weak. The US dollar once retreated to below 1110 yuan at the weakest time at noon. Later, it improved slightly due to the recovery of the gold market. As a result, it fell slightly by two yuan compared with the previous close. Hong Kong dollar quoted that the city seems to be more prosperous, calculated about 10% to 20% higher than the market, buyers are quite active, old banknotes once approached 230 yuan, new banknotes 65 yuan, later prices fell at noon due to the softness of gold prices and the US dollar, the results are still stable, old banknotes are up by 5 yuan compared to the previous close, and new banknotes are up by 1 yuan, British pound is about 2500, Robbie is 220.

Government Bonds: People in the industry continue to hype up, initially flat then firm, and as a result, the various debts continued to rise by 5 yuan to 40 yuan. The overall trend is still stable, but there was some profit-taking at the close. Transactions, except for the C-E series, A-B series were very quiet, and the D series had almost no formal trading except for bidding.

Chinese Stocks: Trading is gradually becoming quiet, but the demand and supply are still relatively stable. The price fluctuates with the gold market. As a result, large-cap stocks are relatively flat, while small-cap stocks fell by 5%. Foreign stocks were not active due to the relationship between the gold market and the US dollar. As a result, the increase and decrease compared to the previous close were minimal, and the turnover was limited.

Rice and Grains: The rice market opened with a strong rally yesterday morning, but due to sluggish actual sales, it weakened at noon. As a result, it rose slightly by 300-400 yuan, Zhongguan increased by 500-600 yuan, and Baiyuan also increased by 500 yuan. However, it is heard that the Special Commissioner's Office of the Ministry of Food has handled large quantities of rice in Wuhu, Jiujiang, and Hankou, and part of it has been transported by China Merchants Group, with several batches arriving in Shanghai in recent days. Flour exports are still good, retail sales have become active, and prices have risen by 100-200 yuan. The oil market rose by 2,000 yuan following the market, soybeans rebounded by 200-300 yuan, and soybean cakes rose by 100-200 yuan.

### Gold Prices in the Provisional Capital Recover

[Our Chongqing dispatch on the 7th] This morning, the opening bid for gold once fell slightly to 83,800 yuan, and the closing price rose to 84,500 yuan.
