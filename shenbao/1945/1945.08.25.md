### Complete Nationalism, Maintain International Peace: Chairman Chiang's Address at the Joint Meeting of the National Defense Standing Committee and the Central Standing Committee

Central News Agency, Chongqing, 24th Dispatch: Chairman Chiang attended a temporary joint meeting of the Supreme National Defense Council and the Central Standing Committee at 9:00 AM yesterday (the 24th) and delivered a speech entitled "Complete Nationalism, Maintain International Peace." The original text is as follows:

The Supreme Truth of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Teachings

Now that Japan has been defeated and surrendered unconditionally, the aggression of power politics has been completely eliminated by the sincere cooperation of the Allied Nations in jointly fighting for world justice. When the First World War came to an end, our Founding Father, Dr. Sun Yat-sen, said: "Those who work for mutual assistance among all nations will succeed, while those who work for the selfish interests of individuals or nations will inevitably disappear." This earnest and sincere maxim for all mankind has been further proven by the greater sacrifices of mankind in this world war. During this period of historical transition, our National Government must have a clear direction for the future in realizing nationalism and achieving the first goal of the National Revolution, to demonstrate to the world and the people of the country, so that we can work together to fulfill our mission of the times, and ensure that this cruel lesson is forever remembered by mankind, in order to create permanent stability for China and universal peace for the world.

Two Major Goals of the National Revolution

Based on this idea, the essential guidelines are listed as follows: The purpose of our National Revolution has two aspects: externally, to seek national independence and liberation; internally, to seek equality and freedom for all ethnic groups within the country. For fifty years, Japanese imperialism has been invading our country day by day, leading to the inevitable all-out war of resistance. Therefore, the focus of the National Revolution movement should first be concentrated on uniting the forces of all ethnic groups in the country to resist foreign aggression together, so as to complete the liberation and independence of the entire country. The most important goals and urgent tasks of our National Revolution are three things: First, we must first restore the territorial sovereignty and administrative integrity of the three northeastern provinces. Second, we must recover our lost territories of Taiwan and Penghu. Third, we must restore the independence and freedom of Korea, because if Korea cannot obtain independence and freedom, Taiwan cannot return to the embrace of the motherland, and the territorial sovereignty and administration of the three northeastern provinces cannot be complete, then the independence and freedom of the country cannot be restored, and the goals of the War of Resistance cannot be achieved. This is the consistent policy of our Founding Father in creating the revolution, and also the greatest goal of our entire nation's sacrifice of tens of millions of lives to resist Japan.

The Eastern Provinces and Taiwan Return to the Embrace of the Motherland

During this period, we must unite all ethnic groups in the country to strive together to complete these three major tasks, and then the independence and freedom of the country can be expected, and the equal status of all ethnic groups within the country can also be guaranteed. Now that Japanese imperialism has been defeated and surrendered unconditionally, Taiwan and Penghu have returned to the embrace of the motherland, and the restoration of the territory and the integrity of sovereignty and administration of the three northeastern provinces have also been achieved. Furthermore, Korea will soon be able to obtain its independence and freedom, and the independence of our country has also established a solid foundation. Thus, the external aspect of our nationalism has reached the stage of completion. Therefore, our internal task is to determine a direction for the work of seeking equality and freedom for all ethnic groups within the country, actively promote it, and realize the entire plan of our National Revolution, in order to guarantee the permanent peace obtained this time by the sacrifice of countless lives and property by our people.

Ethnic Equality and the Foundation of Peace

Today, on behalf of the comrades of our party, based on the teachings of our Founding Father, I explain our policy for implementing nationalism and ensuring freedom, peace, and stability in the future as follows: The first thing to be explained is the ethnic issue of Outer Mongolia and Tibet. Originally, Outer Mongolia and Tibet have a long history, and their ethnic groups live in one place. They are vastly different from the border areas where other ethnic groups intermingle and provinces have already been established. Since the thirteenth year of the Republic of China, when Outer Mongolia sent representatives to participate in the celebration, our Founding Father regarded them as fraternal states, treated them with the utmost courtesy, and this matter is recorded in his teachings and is known to the world. We have never had the intention or attitude of despising their tribes and people, and we will never suppress them as the Beijing government did. Since the establishment of our National Government, we have not only treated Outer Mongolia with such friendship, but also Tibet. Our compatriots across the country must know that if we neglect the will of ethnic equality and freedom and suppress their independent and autonomous development, it will not only violate the spirit of our National Revolution, but also increase the disputes between the various ethnic groups in our country, delay our nation-building plan for a hundred years, and affect the peace and security of the world.

Outer Mongolia's Independence Will Be Recognized

Outer Mongolia has, in fact, completed its independent system since the Beijing government era in the eleventh year of the Republic of China. Now, it has been twenty-five years. At this time of new world affairs, it is time to renew our friendship. We must uphold the principles of the National Revolution and the consistent policy of our party, use resolute determination, go through peaceful procedures, recognize the independence of Outer Mongolia, and establish friendly relations, so that this issue can be resolved satisfactorily. Otherwise, there will never be amity between China and Outer Mongolia, and it will have a significant impact on domestic stability and world peace. (To be continued)

### Legislative Yuan's Provisional Meeting Passes the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance; Foreign Minister Wang Attends and Gives Detailed Explanation

Central News Agency, Chongqing, 24th Dispatch: The Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance has been unanimously passed by the Provisional Meeting of the Legislative Yuan. The meeting was held at the National Government Auditorium at 1:30 PM on the 24th. Red lanterns were hung high in the room, with a large V and four large red characters "Congratulations on Victory" on the front, and the lights on both walls were bright and dazzling, filling the entire hall with joy. Seventy-two members of the Legislative Yuan attended, with President Sun Ke presiding. Foreign Minister Wang Shijie also attended. After the meeting began, the President reported that the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance had been passed by the Supreme National Defense Council and submitted to the Yuan for review, and asked all members to express their opinions as much as possible. The members of the Legislative Yuan then spoke in succession, and the discussion was extremely cautious. Minister Wang Shijie gave a detailed explanation, and there were inquiries and debates from the members. At 2:30 PM, the President announced the end of the discussion and submitted the case to a vote. All members stood up and unanimously passed the treaty. This Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance, which opens a new era in Sino-Soviet relations and lays the foundation for peace in the Far East, completed the legislative process amidst the cheers of all.

President Sun's Thoughts

After the passage of this treaty, the Central News Agency reporter specially visited President Sun to ask for his thoughts. President Sun spoke with excitement and joy: "The passage of the Sino-Soviet Treaty is the first voice for the signing of a new treaty after the victory of the War of Resistance, and it is also the beginning of the entry of Sino-Soviet diplomacy into a new stage. The establishment of friendly relations between China and the Soviet Union is the foundation laid by our Founding Father twenty years ago, and it is also the ideal that our Founding Father intended to establish at that time due to the environment but failed to establish. Today, it can be realized at the beginning of the victory of the War of Resistance, which gives us infinite excitement. The establishment of friendly relations between China and the Soviet Union will not only allow our country's nation-building work to be smoothly promoted in the future, but also provide a guarantee for peace in the Far East. Therefore, the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance is not only welcomed by the people of our country, but will also be welcomed by all countries that embrace peace in the Far East, and even by people all over the world. Eight years ago, at the beginning of our country's War of Resistance, the Soviet Union was the first friendly country to provide us with assistance. Now, at the end of the War of Resistance, there is this Treaty of Friendship and Alliance, which has infinite significance. Looking forward to the future of our country's nation-building, it is very bright and optimistic."

The armies of the Transbaikal Front, the 1st Far Eastern Front, the 2nd Far Eastern Front, and the ships and units of the Pacific Fleet began combat operations against Japan in the Far East on August 9th.

With the support of intense artillery fire and air strikes, our army broke through the enemy's long-prepared strong defenses on the Manchurian border, crossed the Greater Khingan Mountains, and crossed the Amur (Heilongjiang) River and the Ussuri River, and developed a lightning offensive, penetrating deep into Manchuria, advancing five hundred to six hundred kilometers, occupying the entire Manchuria, the southern part of Sakhalin Island, and the Shumshu and Paramushiro islands of the Kuril Islands.

The Japanese Kwantung Army, after ineffective minor counterattacks, ceased resistance, laid down its weapons, and surrendered to our army as prisoners.

The troops of the Transbaikal Front under the command of Soviet Marshal Malinovsky, in cooperation with the Mongolian troops under the command of Marshal Choibalsan, broke through the Japanese defenses in Manchuria—the Zhalainuoer and Halong-Arshan (transliteration) fortified zones, crossed the Greater Khingan Mountains, overcame the waterless Mongolian desert area, advanced nine hundred and fifty kilometers, and occupied the important Manchurian cities of Changchun and Luoyang, Qiqihar, Rehe, Dalian, and Lushun Port.

To commend the victories achieved, the armies and fleets that fought outstandingly on the Far Eastern Front will be awarded the names of Hinggan, Amur, Ussuri, Harbin, Shenyang, Sakhalin Island, Kuril Islands, and Lushun Port, and medals will be awarded.

Today, August 23rd, at pm, the Soviet capital—Moscow—in the name of the motherland, pays tribute to the heroic Transbaikal Front, the 1st and 2nd Far Eastern Fronts, the Pacific Fleet, and the Mongolian troops of Marshal Choibalsan, who liberated Manchuria, southern Sakhalin Island, and part of the Kuril Islands, with twenty-four artillery pieces firing three hundred and twenty-four rounds of salvoes.

For the outstanding combat operations, I thank the armies and fleets under your leadership who participated in the Far Eastern war against Japan.

Glory to the heroes who died in battle for the freedom and independence of the motherland! Long live the victorious Red Army and Red Navy!

### Hostile Mentality Should Be Eliminated; Await Central Government Handling of Everything

Remarks by Director Wu of the Municipal Party Headquarters

Director Wu of the Shanghai Special City Party Headquarters, who arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday, as reported in yesterday's newspaper, has now, based on reports from various sources, made the following remarks regarding the current situation: "The Sino-Japanese War has lasted for eight years. There are still more than one million Japanese troops within our borders, and in terms of equipment and combat effectiveness, they still maintain an advantage before our country implements a large-scale counteroffensive. However, their inevitable surrender is due to their erroneous national policy and their failure to deeply recognize the resilient fighting spirit of our Chinese nation, which is also a reason for their failure.

Hostile Mentality Should Be Eliminated

However, the strengths of the Japanese nation should not be completely erased due to their defeat. I was ordered to work in Shanghai, and until the moment Japan declared its ceasefire, I was constantly in a state of struggle with the Japanese side. Both sides suffered no small amount of blows. Once the Japanese army lays down its weapons, the hostile mentality between us should be eliminated. The experiences of the citizens of this city in the past few years are indeed worthy of sympathy, but if we allow emotional impulses to lead us to despise or even insult Japanese soldiers and civilians, it is not the attitude that a great nation should have. Chairman Chiang has already issued earnest instructions, and all our citizens should abide by them. If there are those who do not heed the advice, or even deliberately provoke incidents, I, who also hold the positions of political and military special envoy, will have no choice but to exercise my authority to bring them back on track. This is the first point.

During the War of Resistance, those who colluded with the enemy, betrayed the country, or abused their power to exploit their compatriots, all patriotic people are indignant, and their punishment is beyond doubt. However, the punishment of traitors is governed by national laws, and free action is not allowed. There is a specific procedure for reporting, investigation, interrogation, and judgment. The circumstances are varied, with differences in the severity of crimes over the years, and there may be cases where merits and demerits are equal, and the sentence may be reduced or waived according to law. Therefore, rash action should not be taken. This is the second point. Regarding the issue of traitorous property, according to the law, it should only be sealed up and confiscated by official agencies after the owners of the property have been declared guilty. If the procedures are not followed and arbitrary sealing up and confiscation occur, social order will inevitably be disrupted, and the purpose of punishing traitors will not be achieved, while those involved will have already committed acts of encroachment. This is contrary to the spirit that people in a country governed by law should have. If temporary requisition is necessary for official purposes, it should also be handled according to proper procedures. This is the third point.

No More Transgressions Allowed

During the war, any means that could strike the enemy or increase our strength were acceptable, especially when the war reached its final stage. Although the central government has sent many personnel to Shanghai in the past half year, their natures are very different. Now that Japan has accepted the Potsdam Declaration and sincerely seeks peace, and no counteroffensive battles have occurred in the Shanghai-Songjiang area, the aforementioned personnel have lost their original purpose. For example, a small number of propaganda personnel, whose original specific mission has become obsolete. Now that the war is over, and the puppet troops stationed in various places have all followed orders to maintain order and await adjustment, the propaganda work can be said to have come to an end. If anyone uses their name to swindle, or even illegally receives property and engages in transgressive actions, such incidents will not be allowed to occur again in the future. As for personnel or institutions with special missions, it is hoped that they will follow the instructions of Mr. Jiang Bocheng, representative of the Chairman of the Military Commission, and register as soon as possible to avoid confusion and to ensure orderly progress. This is the fourth point.

Await Central Government Handling of Everything

The various agencies, schools, and organizations in this city, although different in nature, generally fall within the scope of the Party, government, and military. The city Party headquarters has never left Shanghai from beginning to end. The newly appointed Mayor Qian and the military and police chiefs will also arrive soon. Those who can legally receive agencies, schools, and organizations have their competent authorities, and those that do not fall within the scope of this city should await central government handling. It has been heard that there have been arbitrary receptions of power without authority, which I deeply regret. Even if they are received now, they will still have to be handed over in the future, causing disputes and wasting effort. In the future, it is hoped that those responsible will pay attention to this to set an example. This is the fifth point. The above five points, I feel, are direct and frank, but they are necessary to maintain social order."

Mr. Wu also stated that he has been ordered to assist in municipal administration this time, and specific policy guidelines for the future will be determined after Mayor Qian and the bureau chiefs take office.

Commander Ruan has also specially appointed Senior Staff Officers Shen Tu and Sun Jialiang to come to Shanghai to assist in the work of this district, and a special proclamation has been issued, the original text of which is as follows:

"It is hereby notified that the Japanese government has unconditionally surrendered to us, and the Japanese troops stationed in various areas have successively laid down their weapons. This Commander has received a major order from the Central Government to lead the three armies to advance eastward to Songhu, sweeping away the enemy's atmosphere, restoring the homeland, singing triumphant songs, and jointly celebrating the victory of the War of Resistance. The accumulated national humiliation will be washed away in a single morning, but the removal of the old and the establishment of the new will still take time, and the restoration of order is even more difficult to anticipate. At this time, it is deeply feared that unscrupulous people will take advantage of the situation, incite unrest, or harm the people to benefit themselves, or damage the public for personal gain, harming the country and disturbing the people. This Commander has the full responsibility for maintaining the livelihood of the people and protecting public security, and therefore solemnly makes the following four stipulations, which must be strictly observed: All our fellow countrymen in Songhu and the vanguard troops must, in accordance with international etiquette, refrain from insulting or looting Japanese soldiers and civilians who have laid down their weapons. Violators will be severely punished. All our fellow countrymen in Songhu should adhere to their respective positions and live and work in peace. Those who spread rumors to confuse the public, or swindle under false pretenses, will be severely punished. All food and essential daily necessities needed by our fellow countrymen in Songhu should be sold fairly, and hoarding for speculation is prohibited. Violators will be severely punished. The original stationed troops in Songhu should remain in their original positions awaiting orders and should not move without authorization. Violators will be severely punished. Commander-in-Chief Ruan Qingyuan."

Shangguan Zhibiao, Adjutant of the Four Lines Isolated Battalion, issued an urgent announcement yesterday, saying: "Since the beginning of the Pacific War, all comrades of our Isolated Battalion have been captured by the enemy and detained in the Nanjing Prisoner of War Camp. For the past four years, our comrades have either been killed or transferred to other prisons, and some have even been sent to the South Pacific Islands to work as forced laborers. Although there have been escapes, due to strict surveillance, many are still in Nanjing, enduring hardship and suffering. I, Zhibiao, escaped in the winter of the 32nd year (1943) and joined a guerrilla unit in Jiangnan, but my longing for my comrades has never ceased. Now that the War of Resistance has been won, I, Zhibiao, have been ordered to come to Shanghai. I hope that after seeing this report, my comrades will come to the Shenbao to register as soon as possible, so that we can reunite as soon as possible and discuss future plans.
