### Japanese Army Alert to Enemy Movements, Standing Firmly in the Philippines: Enemy Fleet Discovered West of Luzon

Tokyo, 6th (Central News Agency telegram) – According to reconnaissance by Japanese aircraft on the 5th, an enemy transport fleet of about 100 landing craft, under the cover of a mobile force, appeared in the waters west of Lingayen Gulf in Luzon. Furthermore, a powerful enemy transport fleet, based on about ten or more standard aircraft carriers, is cruising in the waters west of Panay Island. In addition, a powerful enemy transport fleet is advancing westward south of Negros Island. Due to the enemy's new plans, especially the attempt to land on Luzon, the situation in the Philippines is extremely critical. Japanese army units in the area are closely monitoring the movements of the enemy and standing ready for battle.

Tokyo, 6th (Central News Agency telegram) – The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced on the 4th that an enemy fleet, based on about 30 transport ships, entered the Sulu Sea from the Mindanao Sea. At around 7:30 AM on the 3rd, it was fiercely attacked by Japanese kamikaze special attack forces in the Mindanao Sea. Two large transport ships of the enemy were sunk, and one destroyer was destroyed. Despite these losses, the enemy is desperately trying to break through the Japanese blockade. By dawn on the 4th, they had invaded San Jose. At the same time, an enemy mobile force, based on four aircraft carriers providing cover for the fleet, invaded the waters west of Panay Island, to the right of Mindoro Island, on the afternoon of the 4th. Three planes from the Japanese army's special attack unit, "One Sincerity Squadron," each attacked a ship, sinking one enemy aircraft carrier and two battleships or cruisers. In this battle, one Japanese aircraft from the covering fighter squadron crashed itself, and two did not return. Japanese air forces and special attack aircraft teams are currently continuing their fierce attacks on these enemy fleets and mobile forces. In addition, the Japanese air forces in the Philippines are actively attacking enemy fleets and mobile forces advancing into Japanese positions and are continuously and thoroughly hindering the enemy's base operations in Mindoro and Leyte day and night. Following the attacks on enemy airfields in San Jose and Tacloban on the 2nd and 3rd, the Japanese air force launched continuous attacks on Mindoro and Leyte from the night of the 2nd to dawn on the 4th. As announced by the Imperial Headquarters on the 5th, seventeen fires and two explosions were caused in San Jose on Mindoro Island, and ten fires and two explosions were caused at the enemy airfield in Tacloban, Leyte, as well as one fire at the airfield in Dulag. In this operation, eight Japanese aircraft did not return. Although enemy aircraft have been subjected to unified bombing and attacks by Japanese air and land forces, there are still 300 enemy aircraft on Leyte and 50 or 60 small aircraft on Mindoro Island. As the Philippine battle is gradually intensifying, Britain is paying close attention to its movements. In order to contain the Philippine battle, its East Indies Fleet, a mobile force mainly composed of two or three aircraft carriers, appeared in the waters northwest of Sumatra on the 4th. Eighty of its carrier-based aircraft attacked northern Sumatra on the afternoon of the 4th. The Japanese air forces in that area immediately engaged them in a fierce counterattack, shooting down a total of 26 aircraft by dusk. There is still potential for the battle results to expand, while Japanese damage is extremely minimal. Meanwhile, a powerful enemy mobile force attacked Taiwan on the 3rd and 4th and is still cruising in the waters northeast of the island. Currently, the Philippine war has expanded to the seas near Taiwan. The enemy's will to fight a decisive battle in the Philippines and the Indian Ocean is still very strong. Japanese army, navy, and air force units in these areas are united, vowing to kill the enemy. The spirit of the special attack teams is highly encouraged, fighting bravely. There have been no changes in the land battles on Leyte and Mindoro Islands.

### Bose Issues Statement Congratulating the National Government on Participating in the War

Shonan, 6th (Central News Agency telegram) – Subhas Chandra Bose, Chairman of the Provisional Government of India, issued the following statement to commemorate the second anniversary of the Republic of China's National Government's participation in the war: As the second anniversary of the Republic of China's National Government's participation in the war approaches, I, on behalf of all peace-loving and freedom-loving Indians and the Provisional Government of India, express my deepest congratulations. Under the unyielding spirit of the great Father of the Nation, Dr. Sun Yat-sen, and the guidance of the late President Wang, the only successor to the Father of the Nation, the National Government declared war on Britain and the United States two years ago. To drive Britain and the United States out of East Asia and to liberate the nations of East Asia from the shackles of terrifying British and American imperialism, the National Government resolutely joined hands with Japan and other nations of East Asia to participate in this large-scale operation. The two years of the National Government's participation in the war and the events that have taken place have further convinced the National Government and other East Asian countries that Japan's destruction of the military forces of Britain and the United States is based on justice and truth. The National Government's participation in the war is not only for the liberation and unification of China but also for the liberation of all countries in East Asia, which is why it joined this great holy war.

### Snowflakes Fluttered Yesterday Morning: Enemy Aircraft Attacked Kyushu: Investigation of Battle Results Underway

Tokyo, 6th (Central News Agency telegram) – The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced at 4:40 PM on the 6th: Seventy to eighty B-29 aircraft from the Chinese side attacked the western part of Kyushu from the clouds, blindly bombing. Japanese damage was extremely minimal. Investigation of the battle results is currently underway.

Tokyo, 6th (Central News Agency telegram) – The air raid on Japan's Kyushu by enemy B-29 aircraft from bases in mainland China marks the first such attack since the beginning of the new year on the 19th of last month. This attack has a strong implication of reflecting the new developments in the Philippine battle. On that day, enemy aircraft approached in several waves, gradually intruding into key areas of western Kyushu from 10:00 AM onwards. However, due to dense clouds and falling snowflakes, some of the enemy aircraft were unable to enter key areas and retreated midway, while the bombing by other enemy aircraft was entirely blind. As a result, Japanese damage was extremely minimal, and no important facilities suffered any damage. Japanese air defense forces braved the dense clouds and snow to engage the enemy in an interception battle. The results of the battle are currently unclear.

Weekly Commentary

### Who is the Leader of the Chinese Revolution (Part 2)

— Yoshida Shayu

Q: You said that the bureaucrats and scholar-officials who opposed Kang Youwei at the time were not "imperialist running dogs." Then, why did the Chinese intellectuals, led by Sun Wen, rise up in revolution and oppose them?

A: The Manchu Qing Dynasty, in order to protect its own position, originally intended to resist the invasion of foreign imperialism. However, the Manchu Qing knew that it was impossible to wage a war against foreign imperialism head-on. Therefore, it failed to declare a full-scale war of resistance against foreign powers with a firm and resolute attitude. As a result, when Chinese bureaucrats and people clashed with foreign imperialism, the Manchu Qing government secretly encouraged and incited them, but when the situation became unfavorable, it pretended not to know and shirked responsibility. Consequently, parts of land and sovereignty were handed over to foreign imperialists with both hands. The Manchu Qing's overall attitude of compromise and weakness towards foreign imperialism aroused the people with a sense of national conscience, especially the intellectuals. Therefore, Gu Hongming defended the Manchu Qing on the one hand, and explained the Xinhai Revolution on the other, saying: "The reason for the outbreak of this revolution is not to oppose a corrupt government, but to oppose a weak government, that is, to oppose a weak government. The real motive of this revolution does not lie in the Han people's hatred of the Manchus. The factor that gives the revolution power! Violence! is the intense rebellious sentiment aroused by the contempt and humiliation suffered by the Chinese from foreigners. All those who believe in this educated Boxer Movement (Tis Learning boxer movent, referring to the Xinhai Revolution, Yoshida note) think so. As long as we are Chinese, we are despised by foreigners, because we have a pigtail on our heads. We suffer such contempt and humiliation from foreigners, and in fact, the Manchu Qing should bear this responsibility. Therefore, the revolutionaries hate the Manchu Qing and advocate the elimination of all Manchu Qing styles in Chinese territory. As the wise Putnam Weale said, in the current 'revolution to cut off pigtails,' there is a world of pathos (A World of Pathos). In short, the reason for the outbreak of the Boxer Rebellion in 1900 was a flawed national self-esteem, and the reason for the outbreak of the current revolution is national vanity." (The Story of a Chinese Oxford Movement By Ku Hung-ming. P. 124).

Gu Hongming was indeed a world-renowned critic in the late Manchu Qing Dynasty, but his political ideology was that of a royalist. He was Zhang Zhidong's secretary for a long time and was raised by the Manchu Qing's salary for many years, so naturally he could only understand the essence of the Xinhai Revolution in this way. It is true that the Chinese people rose up in anger because they hated the Manchu Qing's weakness and incompetence towards foreign imperialism, but the Manchu Qing government itself cannot escape the responsibility for its weakness and incompetence. For example, what role did the bureaucrats, the most important pillars of the Manchu Qing government, objectively play? When bureaucrats realized that the Manchu Qing could not create a defense against foreign imperialist aggression, they adopted a "defeatist" mentality and engaged in compromising and surrendering to foreign imperialists, while at the same time using foreign power to reorganize the Manchu Qing's political pressure on Chinese peasants. Bureaucrats consolidated the Manchu Qing government in this way, and at the same time, they colluded with foreign imperialists, not only to simply exploit the peasant masses, but also to plan to organize more profitable modernized industries. Therefore, in the context of the Manchu Qing gradually giving Chinese sovereignty to foreign imperialism, such as ceding territory, demarcating concessions, transferring railway management rights and customs, and abandoning the right to autonomous taxation and civil and criminal law rights for foreigners in Chinese territory, the bureaucrats who accepted and handled these treaties of national humiliation also participated in the work of foreign imperialists dividing up China. Such bureaucrats gradually changed from loyal subjects of the Manchu Qing to loyal subjects of foreign imperialism. As a result, in the eyes of the Chinese people, all officials, big and small, of the Manchu Qing government were running dogs of foreign powers who sold out the interests of the Chinese people. And the majority of the Chinese people were Han Chinese, and the main part of the running dogs of foreign powers were Manchus, so the slogan "Revive the Han and oppose the Manchus" deeply touched the hearts of the people. Gu Hongming, who was himself a Manchu Qing bureaucrat, naturally did not notice such an essential change that had taken place in the Manchu Qing bureaucrats. Therefore, his view of the Xinhai Revolution was the same as that of Putnam Weale: "The reason why the revolution to cut off pigtails broke out now is due to the worship of national vanity." If there was no this revolution, frankly speaking, the Xinhai Revolution would not have been launched because of national vanity. We could not have skipped the era of "as long as you are Chinese, you will be despised by foreigners." In order to fight against foreign imperialism, China must first modernize. In order to modernize, the rulers of China must first modernize. If the rulers of China are unwilling to modernize and instead hinder China's modernization, then this group of rulers must be eliminated and replaced with rulers who lead China towards modernization. Unfortunately, the movement of Kang Youwei and others failed, which proves that the Manchu Qing government itself was unwilling to modernize and instead hindered China's modernization. The Manchu Qing government not only did not give up the feudal exploitation of the Chinese peasant masses, but also joined hands with foreign imperialism in an attempt to further strengthen the previous exploitative relationship. Thus, the Xinhai Revolution came into being. If viewed from the perspective of anti-feudalism alone, it is clear that the Xinhai Revolution can be said to be a continuation of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom. At that time, the position of the Manchu Qing government was just like the position of the shogunate that advocated "opening the ports" and opposed "revering the emperor and expelling the barbarians" during the Meiji Restoration. Objectively, both of them wanted to lead wolves into the house and open a wide road for foreign imperialists to invade their country, and they were feudal remnants who could not complete the modernization of themselves and their country. This is why China's national revolution movement did not appear in the form of a monarchical reform movement, but in the form of a thorough destructive movement.

Q: You said that the Xinhai Revolution was launched by intellectuals representing the political interests of Chinese national capitalists. However, the collusion between Chinese national capitalists and bureaucrats is quite deep-rooted. How could they become the main force against the bureaucrats?

A: Under the Manchu Qing government, bureaucrats, landlords, commercial capitalists, and usurers colluded with each other to form a four-in-one feudal exploitative system. These people sometimes had conflicts of interest and quarreled with each other on certain issues, but on fundamental issues, such as the peasant problem, they were always consistent and unified. Just like the four countries of Britain, Prussia, Russia, and Austria, who were constantly quarreling in the early 19th century, formed a united front of the "Holy Alliance" against revolutionary France. However, later, Britain, the most advanced capitalist country at that time, withdrew from the Holy Alliance and shook hands with revolutionary France. Similarly, under the Manchu Qing government, the national capitalists were the ones who withdrew from the "four-in-one" of feudal exploitation and shook hands with the "revolutionary France" of China. To be more specific, Chinese national capitalists were by no means naturally transformed from the commercial capital and usurious capital accumulated from the feudal exploitative system, like a pupa transforming into a moth in a normal relationship. The above-mentioned "four-in-one" of Manchu Qing feudal exploitation were all subordinate to foreign imperialism and played a comprador role to varying degrees. Therefore, when national capital developed from commercial capital and usurious capital gradually tried to start the original activities of capitalism, it already knew that due to foreign imperialist aggression against China, its activities were encountering obstacles everywhere. Important domestic industries (such as railways) were almost entirely in the hands of foreign capitalists, and the "four-in-one" of feudal exploitative relations all colluded with foreign capitalists and were always unwilling to form partnerships with national capitalists. Thus, national capitalists were eager to find partners around them. First, they encountered intellectuals. There were two types of intellectuals, one was the old-style intellectuals who wanted to become bureaucrats and aristocrats but failed. The Kang Youwei faction belonged to this category. Old-style intellectuals, that is, the scholar-official class, became bureaucrats and aristocrats based on their "imperial examination" results. However, when "selling official titles" became an open secret in the late Manchu Qing Dynasty, the prestige of the "imperial examination" had long been plummeted and completely bankrupt, and it was actually very difficult for the poor scholar-official class to become officials in the Manchu Qing government. Therefore, there were also many "dissidents" among the old-style intellectuals who opposed the Manchu Qing government. Some of them participated in the revolution, just as Lafayette and Mirabeau, and other figures from the aristocratic class, also participated in the revolution to overthrow the Bourbon dynasty during the French Revolution. The other type of intellectuals are the modern intellectuals who have received foreign (especially Japanese and American) education, comparing the lives of the American people with the lives of the Chinese people. Thus, this group of people understood how the people under the rule of the Manchu Qing, especially the peasants, were groaning under the iron hooves of feudal exploitative relations, and how they were being stripped of all their freedom under the tyranny of the autocratic demon king. They understood that Japan, which was also Asian, had driven out foreign imperialism, and how the country had made great progress in a short period of time. Japan overthrew the ruling forces that hindered Japan's modernization -- the shogunate. And established a modern government that absorbed foreign culture and could guarantee independence and freedom without injury. Then, a large amount of foreign culture was imported. As a result, this small Asian country was able to defeat a major European power in 1906. This fact greatly encouraged Chinese modern intellectuals. They thought that as long as the corrupt Manchu Qing was overthrown, China could at least achieve eight times the national power of Japan with a population of 50 million. These two comparisons, after being sorted out in Sun Yat-sen's mind, became the foundation of the Three Principles of the People. Rather than calling the Three Principles of the People a revolutionary theory, it is more accurate to say that it is a revolutionary thought narrated with revolutionary enthusiasm. Don't forget that it was precisely because the Three Principles of the People's revolutionary theory was ambiguous that it was most suitable for guiding the entirely complex and varied revolutionary camps at that time. Some theorists criticize Sun Yat-sen's thought for lacking a clear revolutionary theory, but these people have not noticed that only an ambiguous theory can guide the complex and intricate Xinhai Revolution.

Firstly, what the bourgeoisie wanted to contact was the peasants who directly opposed the feudal "four-in-one." The peasants' struggle against landlords and against usurious capital ultimately meant a struggle against the Manchu Qing, which was also a struggle against imperialism. The bourgeoisie wanted to guide this force of peasant struggle onto the track of revolution. Therefore, the Declaration of the First National Congress of the Kuomintang, which truly inherited the tradition of the Xinhai Revolution, clearly pointed out: "Resist imperialism and warlords, oppose special classes that are unfavorable to peasants and workers, and seek the liberation of peasants and workers." However, during the Xinhai Revolution, workers had not yet become an independent and conscious class.

Thirdly, there were the warlords and soldiers. In the late Manchu Qing Dynasty, military officers who maintained local security became semi-independent warlords. They treated soldiers as their own private property and treated the area they maintained security in as their own private territory. Most of them had long lost the concept of being loyal to the Manchu Qing. And most of the soldiers under their command were peasants who had lost their land. The reason why they became soldiers was that the warlords could guarantee their food, clothing, and shelter. The warlords and soldiers were all furious and resentful of the invasion of foreign imperialism and expressed great dissatisfaction with the current situation in China. Therefore, they easily accepted the propaganda of the revolutionaries and became partners in the revolution. For this reason, Li Yuanhong, who was so frightened during the Xinhai Revolution that he crawled under the bed in a state of panic, sent the following letter to Yuan Shikai as soon as he calmed down: "The national treasury and the national army are the foundation of the empire. Both of these are in the hands of the ignorant and weak Manchu party. Look at the property and lives of the 400 million Chinese people being controlled by a small number of Manchus. How can you be at peace..." If we understand that Li Yuanhong was one of the "most progressive soldiers" who had received Japanese education at that time, we will never think that this statement was written under the coercion of revolutionaries.

In short, the Xinhai Revolution was produced by the union of various strata dissatisfied with the corruption of the Manchu Qing. The leadership of the national capitalists and their political representatives, the Sun Yat-sen faction, in this united camp was by no means strong and powerful. Therefore, not long after the Xinhai Revolution, until Chiang Kai-shek's Northern Expedition, the leadership of the bourgeoisie in the revolutionary camp was often almost overthrown by other strata in the same camp. Sun Yat-sen had a full of enthusiasm for saving China from the abyss and opposing the invasion of imperialism, so he was always supported by the Chinese people. This is also one of the reasons why Sun Yat-sen failed in several revolutions but was still able to make a comeback. (Translated by Jing)

Important programs include reading the National Government's Declaration of War Participation, a speech by Secretary-General Zhao of the National Defense Council, a speech by Staff Officer Xiong of the Security Office, Principal Jiang of the Naval Academy, Minister Matsudaira of the Allied News Department, and other speeches, as well as sending a telegram to pay tribute to Chairman Chen on behalf of the city, reading a telegram of condolence to the soldiers on the front lines, and other items. Afterwards, slogans will be chanted and the China United New Film "Hero and Beauty" will be screened. It is expected that there will be a grand occasion at that time, which will further invigorate the city's public's enthusiasm for celebrating participation in the war.

### Youth and Adolescents in the Sixth District Launch Anti-Gambling Campaign

The First Brigade of Youth and Adolescents in the Sixth District has been training in Caohejing, Longcao Township, for a month. Recently, due to the rampant gambling in Xin Longhua, near the brigade headquarters, which has persisted for years and primarily involves notorious gamblers known as "Yellow Hats" and "Black Hats," the brigade, to fulfill their responsibilities as youth and adolescents and for the betterment of the public, will first conduct persuasion efforts. Following this, dozens of brigade members will be dispatched to suppress gambling. Chen Guisheng, the owner of the gambling den, has voluntarily pledged to never again profit from gambling. It is also reported that the brigade headquarters will petition the district league headquarters to forward the request to the Sixth District Police Bureau to assist the brigade in jointly eradicating widespread gambling throughout the Sixth District.

### "Youth Are the Pioneers"

May Everyone Fulfill the Responsibility of Cherishing and Nurturing Them

As the saying goes, "Youth are the pioneers!" This is because young people are vigorous and unafraid of difficulties, forging ahead with courage. Moreover, as they are new to society, they are untainted by bad habits, possess pure hearts, and hold fervent enthusiasm for public affairs. Therefore, they tackle tasks with bravery and initiative, embodying the spirit of "pioneers." Considering the 5,000 students aided by this newspaper, are they not all outstanding students from impoverished backgrounds? Are they not all diligent and studious young people? The saying "It takes a hundred years to grow a person" actually takes only ten to twenty years to enable them to serve society and the nation. In other words, they are all future "pioneers," but currently, they are hindered by their circumstances and need the dedicated support of enthusiastic individuals to fulfill the responsibility of cherishing and nurturing them. Contribute money as you can, the more the better. This is a matter for the entire society. It is hoped that everyone will embrace a sense of "inescapable duty" to contribute to this great movement.

Chongshi Middle School Enthusiastically Raises Funds

A letter from Chongshi Elementary and Middle School states: "To whom it may concern, since our school's faculty and students began the 'Rescue Students from Dropping Out' campaign on December 27th of last year, we have been honored by the support of students' parents and the concern of enthusiastic individuals in society. As of January 4th of this year, we have raised a total of 2,297,220 yuan. After deliberation by the faculty and students, we have decided to retain 1,155,920 yuan as a scholarship fund for underprivileged students at our school. The remaining funds will be distributed proportionally based on the number of students aided by our school in the two newspapers. We will send 751,300 yuan to the News Daily's Social Services Department, and the remaining 390,000 yuan is being delivered by our student representatives Ye Bangdian, Wang Lilin, and Gu Shiyi. This is but a drop in the bucket, a small contribution, but we are doing our best. We hope that you will accept it and publish this letter and the list of fundraising team members in your newspaper, for which we will be deeply grateful."

Youth Middle School Jointly Raises Funds

A letter from Jiang Zijun, the principal of Youth Middle School, states: "To whom it may concern, our school has responded to your newspaper's scholarship fund campaign, with the faculty and students jointly raising funds. In three days, we have raised a total of 134,261 yuan. Although this amount is small, the students' enthusiastic contributions in such a short period are commendable. In addition to selecting and rewarding outstanding contributors within our school, we have divided the donations into seven teams and sent three teams to your newspaper, totaling 60,175 yuan. We hope you will verify and publish this information for public record."

Printing Colleagues Raise Funds in Various Ways

A letter from Chen Daozong of Xincheng Printing House states: "To whom it may concern, for your esteemed 8th scholarship fund, I solicited donations from various friends, and I am grateful for their enthusiastic support, totaling 32,000 yuan. I also received support of 1,000 yuan from Fuxing Machinery Oil Company and others, making a total of 57,000 yuan. I am enclosing it with this letter, and I hope you will accept it. Furthermore, as I am engaged in the printing business, I am also a member of the cultural community. This small amount is merely a token of my contribution. As Shanghai is the national cultural center, there are many of us in the printing industry. If we could be inspired and rise up, the amount would be considerable. It is hoped that the leaders and giants of our industry will take the lead and call upon us."

### Anecdotes from Two Grand Gatherings

...On the afternoon of the 5th, the Shanghai Five Groups Tea Party welcomed Acting Chairman Chen, and on the afternoon of the 6th, the Shanghai Branch of the China News Association hosted a tea party for all sectors. The former was held on the 11th floor of the Cathay Mansions on Changle Road, and the latter was held on the 8th floor of the Cathay Hotel on Nanjing Road. These two tea parties can be said to be the two major events since the New Year, embellishing the New Year scene.

...At both tea parties, the attendees were all well-known figures from all walks of life in Shanghai, with senior government officials and dignitaries gathering together. At the tea party welcoming Acting Chairman Chen, detectives were stationed around the entrance of Cathay Mansions, preventing passersby from approaching. There were an especially large number of cars carrying government officials with official passes.

...Acting Chairman Chen arrived promptly at 4 o'clock, punctual to the minute. He wore a new National Suit, with a leather-collared overcoat. He was physically strong and energetic. Two plainclothes bodyguards accompanied him. Minister Ding Mocun and Secretary-General Wu Songgao, dressed in blue robes and mandarin jackets, were gentle scholars. Minister Lin Baisheng wore a National Suit, leather boots, and had a shaved head, befitting the spirit of the leader of the Youth League. Director Xiong Jiandong wore a military uniform with a sword, draped in a cloak, embodying the essence of a soldier.

...The four elders Li, Wen, Yuan, and Lin, representing the five groups, as well as Chen, the president of this newspaper, as hosts, were all dressed in robes and jackets, warmly welcoming guests. The only female guest was Ms. Qu Zhonglun. A gentleman carrying an extra-large leather bag attracted the most attention.

...Acting Chairman Chen's speech was very modest, but his words were extremely powerful. In it, he quoted Mr. Wang's ten years of "selflessness for the country's sake," and when he spoke of the hardship of his circumstances, tears welled up in his eyes, moving the audience. When he spoke of inheriting Mr. Wang's spirit, and that as long as it was beneficial to national unification, he would sacrifice everything, and responsibly guarantee it to the people of the nation, he raised his voice, excited and impassioned.

...The groups presented Mayor Chen with a large silver cup, engraved with the words "Shanghai Citizens' Affection," which, including the wooden frame, was almost as tall as a person. The value of this silver cup today could have perhaps built a 2,000-ton ship ten years ago.

...During the speeches by the representatives of the presidential group, when they mentioned the need to strictly prohibit extortion and crack down on Black Hats, wise people nodded in agreement. When they spoke of eradicating corruption and eliminating profiteering, perhaps the minds of some people trembled.

...At the Shanghai District Tea Party of the China News Association, the hosts wore red flower ribbons on their chests, warmly receiving guests, seemingly full of joy. A central tiger attracted the most attention, tiring out the photographers. Among those present were Allied Major General 森, Naval Attaché 松岛, Minister 松平 from the Embassy, President Takashima Kikujiro of the Central China Revitalization Company, as well as the newly appointed Governor of Anhui Province, Lin Baisheng, Secretary-General of the Municipal Government Wu Songgao, Li Zanlao, and Wen Lanlao. Yuan Lülao was on another table, discussing the price changes over the past decades. Mr. Xiang Kangyuan's attitude was elegant, and he spoke very little. Many Allied reporters and press figures offered congratulations, among whom Lieutenant 盐田, in his navy blue uniform, long sword at his waist, and black cloak, was most distinguished.

...The atmosphere at the tea party welcoming Acting Chairman Chen and the Shanghai District Tea Party of the China News Association was quite different. The former was solemn and quiet, with a pin drop silence; the latter was full of harmonious atmosphere, with no speeches, everyone occupying a seat, talking loudly, and laughter occasionally breaking out, as if it were a family gathering.

### The Longer the War, the Greater the Enemy's Consumption: Captain Shioda Analyzes the Battlefield

In the Philippines campaign, the Japanese army is already assured of victory, as evidenced by recent triumphant news, which is especially evident. Captain Shioda of the Naval Press Department recently analyzed the situation, stating: The recent offensives by the enemy's American mobile forces in Mindoro and Taiwan are, in fact, a manifestation of their last ounce of strength. The American forces that landed on Leyte Island number approximately 150,000, while those in Mindoro are about 20,000 to 30,000. The supply bases for General MacArthur's troops are Palau Island, the eastern base of New Guinea, and even more distant Australia. As for Nimitz's base, it is Hawaii. Due to the length and distance of the supply lines, maintaining them is fraught with difficulty. Without sufficient naval and army strength in preparation, failure is inevitable. However, considering America's manpower and production capacity, the Americans are currently in extreme pain. The battles of Mindoro and Taiwan are already manifestations of the American forces' last strength. It is impossible for General MacArthur to occupy all the cities in the Philippines. Exerting all their strength, they can only occupy a few points in a vast area. The strength of the Japanese army, on the other hand, is increasing daily. The longer the war continues, the greater the pain for the American forces, which is to be expected.

Enemy Seeks Aid after Naval Defeats

Regarding naval operations, after repeated naval defeats, Nimitz has appealed to the Netherlands and France in Europe for assistance, intending to use the forces they gather to attack the Philippines and Taiwan. If this naval force consisted of large warships, it might still be able to put on a show. However, in reality, this so-called assembled fleet is quite weak. Even if concentrated, it would be powerless. Regardless of the inconsistencies in its speed and combat capabilities, command issues would arise. Even if this motley crew could be entirely transported to the Pacific, it would be vulnerable to a single blow. Its only service would be to protect the enemy's transportation routes. It goes without saying that the enemy's American command is encountering various difficulties. As the enemy's American command has said, although the United Nations claims to be at war with Japan, in reality, it is not the entire organization, but only America alone. Furthermore, they say that war against Japan inevitably involves various losses. Therefore, their inner feelings about fighting in the Pacific are understandable.

Japanese Power is Immense

Conversely, Japan, in its operations in the Philippines, has a large number of transport ships and large vessels that can be used to supply its troops. Since the opening of the battle on Leyte Island, Japan has been fully prepared for the joint increase in land and naval forces in the Philippines. From now on, the enemy will inevitably suffer many losses and even exhaust its strength, inflicting a fatal blow. Japan's air force is also utilizing the latest types of aircraft to exert maximum power. The enemy's mobile force's strength is extremely weak, especially its attack methods, which are very weak. Although the enemy uses its remaining fleet to try to prevent the concentration of Japanese forces, its efforts are in vain, and these plans are useless. In summary, in order to cover up the weakness of its defeat, the enemy may attempt landings elsewhere in the future. However, there are many islands, so the location of its landings cannot be predicted, but Mindanao or Luzon Island seem to be within the realm of possibility. With the Philippines established, no matter where the enemy lands, it will be met head-on by the Japanese army, so there is no need to worry. Moreover, Japan's powerful air force will surely be able to exert its supreme power and obtain a good opportunity to annihilate the enemy.

The Enemy Attempts a Quick Victory

The enemy has repeatedly suffered from Japan's attrition warfare, and the magnitude of its losses goes without saying. From an operational standpoint, the strength of infantry is far less than the power of air bases. Therefore, if the enemy invades, the consumption it suffers will be even greater. In particular, the army and navy special attack teams will inflict irreparable losses on the enemy, like a hurricane sweeping away fallen leaves. Today (6th), the Japanese headquarters announced that the Japanese special attack aircraft team on Mindoro Island sank two enemy transport ships. On average, each transport ship has a crew of 1,000 people, so 2,000 people have been buried in the belly of the fish. Another special attack team sank two enemy aircraft carriers and one battleship in the sea west of Luzon Island. These aircraft carriers are auxiliary-class, with a crew of approximately 3,000 people, while the medium-sized battleship has 1,100 people. The Japanese special attack team involved in this operation had only six aircraft, yet it inflicted such great losses on the enemy. In terms of personnel alone, it annihilated more than 5,100 enemy soldiers. In such a scene of attrition warfare, the enormity of America's losses is clearly evident, and the consumption of its national power is even more obvious. Therefore, the longer the war continues, the greater America's consumption. America's desire to use a quick victory in its war against Japan lies in this reason. After repeated defeats, the enemy can only use Sumatra or the air force in China and Saipan, and even expand its air base on the Aleutian Islands to launch air raids on the Japanese mainland. However, such actions are only a manifestation of the enemy's anxiousness in the war. In short, the Philippine battle is truly a key battle in the Greater East Asia War, and the Japanese military and civilians alike hold firm to their belief in victory and calmly cope with the situation.

Philippine People's Self-Defense Organization

Under the leadership of Presidents Laurel and Aquino, the independence movement of the Philippine people is surging and progressing rapidly. With Japan's support, much has been achieved in the establishment of a new government, and its effectiveness is especially evident. However, those who seek to undermine this independence movement are sparing no effort to devastate it through guerilla warfare. If they use Mindoro and Leyte Islands as bases for resistance and divide the Philippines into ten war zones, the various places will inevitably be disturbed, but the Japanese army is determined to blockade them and defeat them one by one. The day of annihilation is not far off.

America is making every effort to retake the Philippines and is eager to get the Filipinos to help. Although its operational methods are varied, its attack on Leyte Island uses local guerrillas and hopes that after obtaining a base on Leyte, it can seize the Filipinos and make them cooperate. This is very obvious. However, things have gone against their wishes. What they hoped for has turned out to be the opposite. In the Philippines, with Manila as the center, large and small places have exceptionally strengthened their people's self-defense organizations, and the security network is everywhere. Therefore, the success of the guerrillas that America hopes for will ultimately be a bubble. This kind of civil self-defense organization is firmly rooted, and although America launches air raids from time to time, it cannot move it in the slightest. Since September, the enemy has repeatedly carried out large-scale bombing, but the people's hearts are strong, and there is no sign of wavering, which is very comforting. Although the damage under the air raids is not light, the production movement centered on food and construction is progressing without end, and the damage suffered is gradually being recovered. The so-called production movement does not refer to one place or one area but is a widespread phenomenon in various places, self-sufficient and deeply rooted, it can be asserted.

Kamikaze Corps Members Are Disciplined

Recently, a visitor from the Philippines said: Recently, a very large number of Japanese air force members hope to join the Kamikaze Special Attack Corps, almost all of them. The corps members all have the greatest determination and regard assimilation as going home, and they are especially admirable for their strict adherence to discipline. It is said that one day, a group of Kamikaze corps members gathered together, preparing to depart, but somehow they accidentally knocked over an oil lamp, and in an instant, flames blazed. The corps members unwittingly clapped their hands loudly, thinking it was a joke. At that time, a certain second lieutenant, who was very young, heard the news and rushed over, tightly instructing the corps members to remain calm and not to have any carelessness. The Kamikaze corps members have dedicated themselves to the country, and even in this moment before death, they must not be the slightest bit lax in discipline. The strictness of the military on weekdays can be seen from this.

### One Aspect of the Internal Discord in Chongqing-Communist Relations

— Tian Kuan

Chiang Kai-shek's broadcast on New Year's Day this year broke the usual practice by not mentioning international relations at all, but only appealing to the people to focus on concrete measures for resistance and reconstruction, which attracted public attention. But at the same time, this has become the "target of public criticism" from all levels. Those who truly love the country and are worried about China's future must carefully read Chiang's speech, savor its content, and explore China's viable path and Chiang's inner thoughts. As a result, the conclusion reached is: "Is Chiang's guiding principle truly the right path to save China? And the public's criticisms can be roughly divided into two: those who still trust Chiang, or those who feel greatly disappointed.

The CCP's criticism is part of the people's voice, and we need to listen to it. Since Yan'an and Chongqing are in opposing political positions, and there are many new and old grudges in terms of ideology, politics, and military affairs, the criticism of Chiang is inevitably filled with emotional abuse, which we must consider. However, Yan'an often stands on the side of the people and says what the people want to say, which is not entirely unfounded. Yan'an's broadcast on the 4th of this month had extremely sharp criticism of Chiang's speech, pointing out Chiang's contradictions and deceptions to the best of its ability, but in its malicious words, we can also find some points that are not without reason. For example, it says:

"The greatest crisis Chiang Kai-shek spoke of last year stemmed from the Kuomintang's defeatist fascist policy, but it made society responsible for it. It also claimed that because the public's burden was not enough, it had a great impact on the army's morale and combat behavior, which was also the responsibility of society. And the government's self-criticism only claimed that wartime administration was not thorough enough. Just pointing out this point, the public's hatred of Chiang Kai-shek's oligarchy can be imagined."

How much hatred there is, let's put that aside for now, but Chiang is forcing the people to sacrifice and endure any harsh demands in order to get through this year, demanding that landlords and the rich provide money and food, which is a matter of life and death for the exhausted people. To further strengthen the war burden that has been accelerating for the past eight years, and at the same time to take responsibility for defeat for others, no matter what kind of people, they cannot help but complain.

Secondly, Yan'an thoroughly exposed the deception of Chiang's promise that "as long as the military situation is stable and the foundation for counter-offensive is established, the constitution will be promulgated and power will be returned to the people." It said:

"Chiang Kai-shek's statement assumes that the Chinese people have no memory, but in fact our memory is very good. We know that the constitution should have been implemented on February 10, 1934, and we have not forgotten the Kuomintang's promises to convene the National Assembly and implement constitutional government on November 12, 1936, November 1937, and November 12, 1940. And we have also heard the agreement to implement constitutional government within one year after the end of the war. Moreover, many of these agreements were made before the start of the war. At that time, was the convening of the National Assembly not actually a military crisis that made it difficult? Then why was it not convened as scheduled?"

Then, regarding the phrase "as long as the military situation is stable and the foundation for counter-offensive is established," it retorted as follows:

"In the past seven and a half years, the military situation has not been as bad as it is now. Then when will the military situation be stable and the foundation for counter-offensive be established? Although Chiang Kai-shek often said that final victory is absolutely guaranteed, he suddenly issued a statement to the world in January 1945 that final victory was not guaranteed. In the past, there was a date for convening the National Assembly, but today's agreement does not specify a date, and there is so little confidence in the stability of the military situation and the establishment of a counter-offensive foundation."

After Yan'an vehemently criticized Chiang's empty promises, it raised practical questions, asking whether the content of the National Assembly was the same as before the war, or whether new representatives would be elected? And it raised questions about how to elect local representatives during the war, and who would preside over the meeting, etc.

Yan'an's accusations touched Chiang's sore spots. The sign that the promise of constitutional government, which was brought out as a magic weapon to mobilize the people to continue the war, was contrary to Chiang's true intentions was exposed without a doubt.

### The Key to Victory in the Greater East Asia War

— Bao Wenyue

The Greater East Asia War has already entered the decisive stage, and final victory will definitely belong to us, which can be affirmed with great certainty. In the initial stage of the war, the allied nations used surprise attacks and tactical assaults to frighten the enemy, laying the foundation for victory. In the full-scale war stage, the allied nations developed resources, increased their war power, and implemented a war of attrition, causing the enemy to suffer heavy losses. Its final victory is of course without question. But why will the enemy inevitably be defeated, and why will Greater East Asia inevitably win? The main keys are specially described below:

(1) Political: The Greater East Asia War is a war of righteousness against injustice. The enemy is invading East Asia, which is unjust. The allied nations are seeking East, which is just. A just cause is strong, and an unjust cause is weak. The enemy is using an unjust army, so how can it not be defeated in the end?

(2) Psychological: This war is one of harmony on one side and discord on the other. In the enemy, although it is called united, in reality, they sleep in the same bed but dream different dreams, united but not knowing. In the allied nations, there is unity from top to bottom, and common hatred of the enemy. At the same time, we are also supporting the entire nation of Greater East Asia, creating a great unity of 1 billion people in Greater East Asia. As the saying goes, "Victory lies in harmony." With this kind of harmonious power, the front and rear are working together, and the final victory is in our hands.

(3) Spiritual: The spirit of the allied nations is as strong as a panda, and the spirit of the enemy is shrinking. The enemy has soldiers with self-deprecating morale and no spirit of sacrifice, confronting the allied nations' army with a righteous, self-disciplined, and strong spirit. Victory or defeat can be determined.

(4) Strategic and Tactical: The enemy's strategy and tactics are slow. In the past, the allied nations' outer-line operations were correct. Proactive inner-line operations, outer-line operations emphasize encirclement, and inner-line operations emphasize breakthrough. In the initial stage of the war, the allied nations broke through the enemy's encirclement in one fell swoop, so the enemy had to abandon the outer-line operations, the most advantageous long-term war, the encirclement war strategy, and adopt the most unfavorable active offensive strategy and the tactics of bombing with aircraft. The allied nations, on the other hand, ensured resources and turned the counter-offensive into defense, turning it into a long-term invincible state. They adopted an offensive defensive strategy and attrition tactics, greatly consuming the enemy's war power, weakening it day by day, and then annihilating the remaining enemies in one fell swoop, completing the final victory. This is the successful outcome of the allied nations' correct and superior strategies and tactics.

(5) Geographical: The enemy is sending troops on a long expedition, and the allied nations are waiting at ease. This situation will become more and more obvious as we reach the final decisive stage. Since ancient times, those who have exhausted their troops and launched long expeditions have never failed to be defeated, and those who have taken advantage of the terrain and waited at ease have never failed to win. Such as the campaign to conquer Russia, Napoleon's defeat, and the Russo-Japanese War, the defeat of the Russian fleet at Tsushima, are extremely obvious precedents. With the results of the past three years of war, as well as history, politics, people's hearts, the spirit of sacrifice, strategic tactics, and geographical relations, the final victory of the Greater East Asia War will definitely belong to us and will be realized soon.

### Nocturne

— Situ Wei

Suddenly waking up from a strange dream, in the cold, cold night, I felt a bit of the fatigue of someone who had trekked a long distance.

Now I can't quite remember that dream clearly. It has faded away, and it is still fading away, like an ancient ink painting—those non-existent places and non-existent characters: that small courtyard with faint sunlight, that path where cold and mottled light flowed over the pebbles, lonely sighs and soft whispers.

(In such a night without lights or moon, at such a time of deep thought, young people who are good at dreaming: do you think it is as easy for me to pick up a slight sense of loss—a strange sense of loss, like black coffee that has not been adequately sweetened—as it is to pick up a terrifying fantasy?)

I seem to be standing in a small town at twilight, listening to the sound of horses' hooves echoing through the old, long street, lonely and sadly fading away. I also seem to have lost something valuable before a long journey. I can't name it, but I clearly feel that I have lost something.

I miss those lost things as I miss yesterday's sunlight, as I miss my own lonely shadow.

—What have I lost?

As I thought, I lit a cigarette and exhaled the smoke into this moonless night. In the darkness, I saw a lonely little star light up in front of me, a thoughtful, melancholy eye. I also saw tangled vines crawling up from the corner of my mouth, crawling over the gentle, flickering light, revealing their milky white bodies, like ribbons and rings.

And I lay wistfully on the bed, staring with indifferent eyes at the high-piled darkness. Cold, cold darkness, piled all the way up to the ceiling. Staring like this at those non-existent places and non-existent characters in my memory, I know, just as I am now staring at that wisp of smoke like a ribbon and a ring in front of me. They seem to be "changing in an instant," boasting of the magnificence of life. In fact, every second they are quietly melting and fading—every second they are aging. That youth will soon fade away!

"The school of beautiful life is a short life," I thought as the glimmer at the end of the cigarette gradually dimmed: "The things that make people miss them are always the things that are easily lost..."

—But what exactly have I lost? In this cold, cold night.

Young people who are good at dreaming, I think you can tell me. Because in this world, there is only one thing that is lost forever when it is lost, and you also know that people never have two identical dreams.

### A Pearl Cast Before Swine

— Yi Xuan

The sound of rain pattering, the sound of wind sighing, the cold wind enters through the cracks in the window, and in the dim light, I suddenly feel that it is already the severe winter season. My thoughts are very dull, reminiscing about old friends, what else can I think about?

### Nightmare

— Stie

Already suffering from the clamor of daylight, it further denies me peace in my dreams. Could it be that my ark is too small to bear the disasters of the century?

There is no need to tear open my wounds with cold claws, nor is there any need for mockery or to ignite with phosphorus fire.

I randomly picked up a photo album, flipping through it page by page. Some of these familiar faces are still in a circle of happiness, while others have already weathered the storms of life. As time passes, how many faces are full of youthful innocence. However, fate has also brought them unexpected encounters.

Suddenly, the doorbell rang. On this rainy night, who would come to visit me? Perhaps it's a patient requesting a house call, but the questioning voice is familiar. Listening carefully, I rushed downstairs.

"Fang, long time no see! Please come upstairs." I dragged and pleaded with her to come into the room. Under the light, I almost couldn't believe she was the close friend I hadn't seen for over a year.

The plump cheeks and sparkling eyes had all disappeared without a trace. The Yu Fang standing before me was so haggard, thin, and lost.

I asked her to take off her soaked raincoat, but she shook her head in refusal. We stood in silence for a long time. She hesitated to speak several times. Overwhelmed by surprise and joy, I didn't know where to begin.

She flipped through the photo album. I stared blankly at the rainwater dripping from her, my thoughts gathering like raindrops.

I hadn't seen Yu Fang for almost two years. During this time, I knew her situation very well. I am not an alarmist, but I have the sensitivity of one. As early as four or five years ago, from her fondness for vanity, weak will, and impoverished family background, I often feared that she would go down a path of depravity. However, I never had the confidence to reveal my hidden worries. How long ago was it? My fears have become reality, even worse than I imagined.

At first, friends said she had become a dancer, which I didn't believe. Until one day, I happened to meet her on a busy street, I was stunned: a leather coat, high heels, curved eyebrows, and scarlet lips, transforming a lively girl into a graceful and luxurious young woman. She seemed embarrassed, exchanged a few hurried greetings, shook hands with me, and said goodbye. This street was full of dance halls, so I believed the rumors, and I understood why she was avoiding us.

However, she didn't realize that those of us who were close to her had no intention of looking down on her. On the contrary, we were full of sympathy. Although we were powerless to help her escape the bad environment, we were willing to offer assistance and guidance when she walked down the wrong path, but she isolated us.

"Being a dance partner is not a disreputable profession, as long as she is truly selling her skills, and not selling her body and soul." We always wanted to offer these words to Yu Fang, although she may already know it. But in that world of pleasure, how many people are bright and pure? Perhaps they are clear-headed when they first step in, but after a long time, they are swept away by all the material and erotic temptations, and fall into the maze.

In a low voice, Yu Fang told me that she had been fooled by someone. She had been robbed of her innocence and lifelong happiness, and what she has now is a pregnancy in her womb. She is still young, only twenty years old. She still wants her reputation and future. Therefore, she came to ask me to ask my father to destroy this unborn little life.

I knew this was illegal, but I couldn't resist her pleas, and I finally walked into my father's room.

I mustered up my courage and asked, "Is abortion always illegal?"

"Not necessarily, it depends on the situation. If it is because of a serious illness and the fetus must be removed to save the mother, then abortion is not illegal. But within the realm of possibility, we should try our best to preserve the safety of both mother and child."

"What if it's for the sake of a woman's reputation and future, Father, could you perform one?" So I told him about Yu Fang's predicament.

"I can't," my father replied sternly. "You study law, don't you know the regulations?"

I told Yu Fang, and she was of course extremely disappointed. After moaning for a while, she went to ask my father herself. The result was still a refusal. My father said, "Miss, I know your difficulties, but this is not only an illegal act, but also an improper thing in a doctor's ethics. But when the time is right, I can deliver the baby for you, and vow to keep this secret. I will also arrange for the child."

Besides this, there was no better way. Yu Fang had no choice but to get up and leave. Finally, my father sincerely told her, "Don't find another doctor to perform an abortion for you, this is not only dangerous to your own life, but also inhumane to kill a life arbitrarily. The mistakes that have been made can be made up for with sincere repentance."

After Yu Fang left, my father sighed regretfully, "What a good girl, how did she end up on this path? It's really a shame!"

My father's last words aroused my sympathy, and I couldn't help but defend her, "Father, don't just blame her, her family should also bear half the responsibility. Her parents only knew how to suppress their children with harshness, neglecting well-intentioned guidance. When Yu Fang first became addicted to the bad habit of vanity, they didn't dissuade her, letting her spend all day and all night in the dance hall. When she officially became a dancer, they looked down on her and scolded her. She didn't get any comfort or correct guidance in her family. Even the closest family members didn't have a little warmth. Of course, upon hearing the sweet words of others, she easily believed them and easily fell into the trap. After all, she is still a naive girl, how can she distinguish between black and white, right and wrong at once? If her parents could use love to correct her mistakes, she would definitely understand that improper love between men and women is false, despicable, and unreliable, and she would definitely be content with poverty and not covet the prosperity of the world."

My father sighed again and again. I knew he was feeling the emotions of Yu Fang's parents from a parent's perspective.

### Three Short Songs

— Mai Ye

Worries

The first lament of the young is the sigh of troubled days; happiness that is about to be touched vanishes in an instant.

Self-Portrait

Self-portraits are the least realistic; pale complexions become rosy, ugliness becomes beauty. In the entire history of human inventions, only the mirror has failed to depict its purpose.

At Dusk

The loneliness of dusk is deeply felt by the old plane trees on the street; when the light of the setting sun is sent by the evening breeze, even foreheads without white hair will slowly age.

### Desert Journey

— Zhi Yun

Let's go, dear camel! I know you're hungry and thirsty. There's nothing to miss here. Green grass and water are in the forefront.

The night is deep, and the wind and sand are still raging. The darkness all around has obscured familiar roads, but the camel, bearing its heavy burden, continues to grope forward.

Not afraid of the terror and darkness of the night, not afraid of the ruggedness and remoteness of the road. When the last second of the night ends, lovely daylight will come. When the last stretch of the rugged road ends, the future will be a broad avenue.

Let's go, dear camel! For the sake of green grass and water, light and broad avenues. Struggle forward with a spirit of perseverance and courage, determined to walk out of the desert and reach the forefront of the lush pasture road!

### Road Workers

— Ke Ren

Look, this barren land!

Weeds and puddles dot the landscape, giant mountains and large trees block the way. Pedestrians and vehicles avoid it. The exchange of materials between the two places is interrupted. We are a group of road builders!

Not afraid of the threat of scorching sun and torrential rain, not caring about the prying eyes of venomous snakes and packs of wolves, hunger and thirst cannot suppress our spirit, and fatigue is not enough to stop our work. Let's bring out all our abilities!

Removing weeds, filling puddles, blasting down giant mountains, digging up large trees, building a broad avenue, and fulfilling the mission eagerly awaited by the people!

### Book

— Ding Da Xin

I have a lover who accompanies me and never leaves me. She is not a compass, nor is she the North Star. Yet she leads my "qing ling", traversing desolate heart-cities, communicating with me in the darkness, talking about ancient and modern times!

### Life

— Yu

Let me tell you: only the money earned with your own blood, sweat, and effort can bring you true joy.

"Life is a comedy," but we should not stand in a position of appreciation, criticize to our heart's content, point out and expose all errors, all shady dealings, and all corruption.

When blaming others, first ask yourself if you have flaws that can be blamed by others?

As long as there is dependence, there can be no day of success.

Outward flexibility and inward firmness is the philosophy of life.

Jealousy is the main culprit that prompts you to take transgressive actions.

"Laziness" is the fuse that will destroy your life!

"Gentlemen use words, petty people use their hands," don't think that scholars can scold people!

There is no room to argue with ignorant people!

When the environment is bad, you can ask "patience" to be your bodyguard!

Making friends with girls should focus on academic discussion and spiritual comfort and support.

### Tragic World

— Zhu Lin

The ×× cigarette factory posted a notice at the gate, wanting to recruit two workers. The next morning, there were more than thirty people crowded at the factory gate.

The accountant was a young man full of vigor and compassion who had just come out of school. Facing these simple and honest faces, he didn't know who to hire, because these people seemed to need to find a job immediately to solve their lives.

He couldn't figure out a way, so he had to ask the foreman to call them in one by one and ask a few simple questions.

At this time, the foreman called in a very thin young man. From his gaunt face and clapping hands, the accountant saw that this was not the look of a laborer, so he asked as usual: "What's your name?"

"Wu Zhaoguo, the 'Wu' of 'mouth' and 'heaven', the 'Zhao' of the dynasty, and the 'Guo' of the country."

The accountant was stunned by the first answer. These are words that someone who has studied for a few years can say.

"Where are you from?"

"Anhui?"

"Aren't you afraid that being a worker is very hard?"

"For the sake of life, what's so hard about it?"

"The workers' pay is the lowest."

"But it's better than starving."

The accountant felt that this was not a person to be a worker. Since he couldn't help him, why bother him with irrelevant questions? So he waved his hand and said, "Come back in the afternoon to hear the news!"

The thin Wu Zhaoguo trudged out.

A weak, bookish young man is willing to come and do the hardest work with the lowest pay. This is something that the accountant feels is very strange, but it is precisely because of the deep thought caused by this strangeness that Wu Zhaoguo actually received a work card and went to work. He seemed to know the accountant's kindness, so whenever he saw the accountant at work, he would always respectfully call out, "Mr. ×!"

In fact, he only took two hundred and fifty yuan a day in wages, which was the lowest wage in the entire factory. Fortunately, he had no family burden and a small appetite, so life was not more difficult than other workers. It was just that he had no strength. Every time he carried a large cigarette box down the seven or eight steps of the escalator from the fourth floor, his precarious appearance was worrying, which often caused the grumbling of the packaging room manager. But when he saw that sallow face, he felt he couldn't speak, because he knew, who would willingly come to do hard labor? If he had a better way out.

Moreover, he only wore two thin shirts to work every day. In the morning, he would shiver from the cold. One day, the accountant asked him:

"Why don't you wear a few more clothes?"

"My winter clothes were all eaten up in the summer."

The accountant didn't ask any more questions. He thought that he could find a way for him to advance some wages from the factory, so he told him:

"Come to the accounting room after work."

The accountant made a note, said a few good words to the director, and borrowed two thousand yuan to be deducted from the first half of the month's wages.

In the evening, when Wu Zhaoguo received the money from the accountant, he was so grateful that he almost shed tears. He then told the accountant:

"I originally graduated from junior high school. Unfortunately, my parents both died of poverty and illness. For the past few years, I have been teaching in a small school in Nixi. But a small school teacher only gets two or three thousand yuan a month to eat, and they only get paid for ten months a year. How can people live like that? Later, I couldn't even find a small school teacher. After eating and pawning for a few months, I was really at the end of my rope."

The accountant was very moved by what he heard. He decided to do his best to give this unfortunate person some help.

When Wu Zhaoguo put on the new undershirt he bought with the advanced wages, he was warm, just like the warmth in the accountant's heart. However, when the wages were paid on the fifteenth, Wu Zhaoguo only had seven hundred and fifty yuan left after deducting the advance. This made the accountant think, how could seven hundred and fifty yuan last until the end of the month?

Therefore, when the accountant handed out the wage bag, he couldn't help but add: "Come and borrow some more when you run out!"

In the days when the price of rice was rapidly rising and breaking the ×0,000 mark, a few days later, the accountant once again begged the director to borrow fifteen hundred yuan, and the accountant generously agreed to be the guarantor.

But, Wu Zhaoguo took sick leave.

The illness was hemoptysis and laryngitis. The accountant had asked a co-worker who lived nearby to visit him. When he asked about his condition upon his return, the accountant determined that he had a serious lung disease.

More than ten days later, Wu Zhaoguo appeared in front of the accountant. He was so sick that his eyes were sunken and his cheekbones were high. He stared at the accountant with dull, deathly eyes.

"Mr. ×!"

The accountant noticed from his trembling that the undershirt was missing from his old jacket.

But Wu Zhaoguo had already noticed the accountant's attention:

"The undershirt was exchanged for medicine."

"What are you going to do?"

"A doctor's visit costs more than three hundred, and a prescription costs six or seven hundred. What can I do but wait to die?"

The accountant felt the salary he had just received in his pocket, but he thought of his old mother and weak younger brother, and he also thought of the tens of thousands of yuan per dan of rice, and he also thought of the loan guaranteed for Wu Zhaoguo. He felt very hesitant.

However, the spirit-like patient standing in front of him was tapping on his kind heart, and he took out six hundred yuan from his meager reward for a whole month of hard work as if with a great determination and gave it to him.

"This is my personal help to you."

Wu Zhaoguo slowly reached out to take the money, speaking with a faint voice, "You also guaranteed the loan for me, Mr. ×, I cannot repay your kindness in this life, I will repay you in the next life!"

The accountant's heart felt very heavy. He only said, "Go back and rest well," and sent him out of the factory gate.

Another week later.

A co-worker came to tell the accountant:

"Wu Zhaoguo vomited blood and died. He died in the workshop of the ×× yarn factory where he was living. He was a single person without any relatives. It's so pitiful. Early this morning, Pushan Villa..."

The accountant couldn't bear to listen any longer.

He felt that maybe he had harmed him. If he hadn't hired him to be a worker at that time, and hadn't done such hard work, maybe he wouldn't have died so quickly! He felt the pain, because when he was still in school, he had never thought that there would be such tragic things in the world, and even today he still doubts:

Is society really so cruel?

### Sino-Portuguese Cup: Learning from Past Mistakes, Further Contributing to the Chinese Team's Lineup

— Xie Yiqin

After being suspended for several years, the Sino-Portuguese Cup has been reinstated by the Football Association this year, much to the delight of fans. This year's Chinese team is brimming with talent, and the Portuguese team is also very well-organized. There is no doubt that the skill displayed will be worth watching. Furthermore, considering the current state of the Chinese team, it is not hopeless to defeat the three cities. The lineup contributed by Mr. Bi Xian in the previous issue was very insightful, but unfortunately, the authorities did not adopt it. In the second half, arbitrary substitutions were made, with Zhang Lingen filling the rear, Li Yichen playing center-back, and Sun Jinshun as center-forward. All of these were forcing them into unfamiliar positions, a reckless gamble. How can any achievement be expected in a competition concerning international honor? As a result, they suffered a crushing defeat, disappointing thousands of fans. The loss was secondary; the lack of a good performance was truly regrettable. What's done is done. The cup uses a best-of-three format. Having lost the first game, the Chinese team should learn from this lesson and redouble their efforts. They can still win the remaining two games and secure this year's reinstated Sino-Portuguese Cup. Before the date of the second game is decided, I would like to express my personal views, hoping it will serve as a combination of damage control and preventative measure.

Advantages of the Portuguese Team in the First Game

First, let's look back at the advantages of the Portuguese team in the first game. The entire team can be said to have achieved a state of perfect harmony. A special point is the ability of the center-back line to coordinate with both the front and the rear. Secondly, the selection and deployment of the forwards were appropriate, with V. Sousa shifting to the left wing, achieving the effect of both wings flying together. Center-forward Bauxita was good at running and making penetrating runs, while the two inside forwards, Leda and Pantouxon, were both able to retreat and assist in defense, forming a seven-man defense. During the attack, they acted as cover, completing a formal "W" formation on their line, and each was able to use their strengths. Since the Chinese team's defense was weak, the Portuguese team was able to fully display its strengths.

Reasons for the Chinese Team's Failure

Having identified the advantages of the Portuguese team in all aspects, we can seek ways to counter them. Here, we might as well discuss the criticisms of the Chinese team on that day. In my opinion, Meng Yiliang and Wu Qixiang performed satisfactorily, while Zhang Lingen, Zheng Yingyao, and Luo Shoufu were out of form, and the rest were mediocre. Now, let's further discuss the lineup for the next battle, hoping that the authorities will adopt it accordingly and not dismiss it as mere armchair strategy. This is extremely important!

The most important aspect of a team's connectivity is the center-back line. Seeing the Chinese team's previous defeat and the Portuguese team's victory, I am even more convinced of this. Therefore, I dare to start with a study of the center-back line. For the center-back position, I believe Song Lingsheng must be used. Song is a skilled ball-handler, and the attack relies on this central route. Furthermore, Zhou and Song have similarities in terms of height and speed of center-forward Bauxita, so letting Song focus on Bauxita can ensure there are no worries. This will stop the Portuguese team's central breakthrough tactic. The left midfielder should still be Meng Yiliang. Yiliang has been in excellent form recently. He was quite effective in harassing Funes in the previous game. Therefore, it is generally said that Funes did not develop much in that game and should be considered out of form. This is a misunderstanding; it should be attributed to Yiliang's hard work. Using Yiliang's abundant energy to contain Funes is equivalent to crippling one of their wings. Then, use Tan Fuzhen as the right midfielder. Some people will definitely object to this, and Tan himself may be reluctant to try it lightly, but upon close observation, the opponent's left forward and left winger, retreat to assist the defense, taking advantage of the winger's rapid advance. The winger is V. Sousa, who is deeply accomplished. Sousa's skills are composed but directional, just like Zhou and Old Tan. An eye for an eye, though resulting in mutual damage, will also cripple their wings. With both wings lost, the reduction in their offensive momentum will be a definite fact. Even if it cannot be as ideal as I said, occasional losses are inevitable. We can retreat and discuss further. Use Wu Qixiang as the right fullback. Wu has recently returned to his peak form, excelling in all aspects, making him the most ideal candidate. Therefore, even if V. Sousa slips past Tan Fuzhen, he will definitely not be able to pass Wu Qixiang. The left fullback is still Li Tiansheng, who is more cooperative with Zhou and Wu Qixiang. The goalkeeper should also be Liu Nanhan, which will allow for a better understanding with Qixiang and Tiansheng. In this way, each individual on the defensive line has a tight combat responsibility, working together to stop the sharp Portuguese forward line. The wonderful moments, the evenly matched strengths, will definitely be worth watching.

Ideal Lineup

Finally, let's talk about the forward line. My view is the same as Mr. Bi Xian. Looking at the first game and reviewing the current situation, Xu Wenkui and Dai Linjing are injured and are unlikely to appear in the near future. Jia Youliang as right winger, Han Longhai as right forward, Li Yichen as center forward, Sun Jinshun as left forward, and Li Yao as left winger, all have their own strengths. The opponent's defense is good, but it is hoped that they can be broken through. In short, although this lineup is only one person's opinion, it is reasonable and represents the general consensus. I consider myself a loyal fan. For more than ten years, I have attended every good game, and I have interacted with other fans, discussing with great interest. However, I have rarely written before. This time, seeing that the Chinese team, with so much talent, is unable to make good use of it, I am filled with emotion. Therefore, I am happy to discuss it further to enrich this newspaper. The writing is clumsy, but I hope knowledgeable people will not laugh at it. Therefore, I hope that the Chinese team's lineup in the second game of the Sino-Portuguese Cup will be as follows:

Liu Li Tiansheng Xian Han Wu Qixiang Meng Yiliang Song Lingsheng Tan Fuzhen Li Yao Sun Jinshun Li Yichen Han Longhai Jia Youliang

### Essentials of Basketball Theory (9)

— Liang Zhaoan

(1) When the situation is not suitable for shooting, it is better to hold the ball tightly and turn to avoid the opponent, or pass it back to a teammate behind you, rather than rushing to shoot in order to get rid of the ball.

(2) Do not shoot with your back to the basket, because you cannot see the basket accurately, which is equivalent to giving the ball away to the opponent.

(3) Do not shoot when you are off balance.

(4) Use both hands to shoot as much as possible.

(5) Shoot when you are in an area where you are very confident, or when you cannot pass or dribble the ball. Remember the steps of individual offense: (1) Pass the ball - (2) Dribble the ball - (3) Shoot the ball - (4) "Rotate"

(6) For shots within 20 feet and at an angle of 15 to 45 degrees from the free throw line, use a bank shot. At other angles, use a direct shot into the hoop.

(7) When shooting under the basket, use one hand, jump high, and the closer you are to the basket, the more accurate you will be.

(9) Do not shoot in a straight line, but make the path of the ball an arc into the basket.

(10) Do not stand still after shooting, but immediately follow up and try to regain the ball to attack, or if the ball is lost, retreat to defend.

(Correction) In this article published on December 31, there are several parts that should be corrected as follows. (1) In the tenth line of the first paragraph, the word "gain" in "its gain and failure" is a mistake for "win." (2) In the fifteenth line, the word "equal" in "this may be equal rumors" is a mistake for "belong". (3) In the second last line of the third paragraph, the word "outside" in "however, they often fail to shoot outside" is a mistake for "commit". (4) In the fifth line of the first paragraph, the word "is" in "but what method is used" is a mistake for "no."
