### Japanese Air Force Raids Okinawa Airfield, Heavily Bombs Nearby Fleet, Matsuwa Island and Balikpapan Shelled

Ryukyu Islands Base, 17th, Central News Agency: On the morning of the 10th, the Japanese air force launched a sudden attack on the airfield on Okinawa Island, causing several major fires. Enemy aircraft also raided the island chain on the same day, numbering around 280, of which over a hundred attacked Tanegashima.

Northern Base, 17th, Central News Agency: At approximately 7:00 PM on the 11th, taking advantage of the heavy fog, enemy warships, mainly destroyers, approached Matsuwa Island and subjected it to naval bombardment, before retreating southeast. The following day (12th) at dusk, a cruiser and two destroyers reappeared in the vicinity, approaching the island from the northeast. From 6:44 PM for about twenty minutes, they used flares and shelled the island from a distance of 6,000 to 7,000 meters, before fleeing south. Japanese damage was minor.

Southwest Pacific Base, 17th, Central News Agency: On the evening of the 15th, a group of enemy surface warships approached the vicinity of Balikpapan and subjected the coast to naval bombardment.

### Recent War Situation in Various Parts of East Asia

Tokyo, 17th, Central News Agency: The recent war situation in various parts of East Asia is as follows:

Mariana and Ogasawara Islands: The number of B-29 type aircraft in the Mariana Islands has been gradually increasing recently, reaching as many as 750 to 900. The base on Iwo Jima is also currently being strengthened, and it is expected that the enemy air force strength in that area will continue to increase in the future.

Luzon Island: Japanese troops on Luzon Island are still holding onto the strategically important Baret Ridge and Salacsac Ridge, continuing to engage in fierce fighting. There have been no major changes in the war situation in other areas. The Baret and Salacsac fronts have been fiercely contested for three months since mid-March. The Japanese army is using heroic charges and close combat to stop the enemy advance. The enemy has attempted to break through the two ridges with artillery and air force, but the Japanese army continues to launch fierce counterattacks on all positions, with extremely high morale. Japanese forces at the eastern strongholds of Manila are still holding their positions and inflicting heavy losses on the enemy. The combined results of the fighting in that area (excluding the street fighting in Manila and the Corregidor Island front) up to the end of May, confirm approximately 43,600 enemy killed, 213 artillery pieces destroyed, and approximately 1,500 vehicles destroyed.

Southwest Pacific: On the island of Tarakan, Borneo, it has been a month and a half since the enemy landed. Both sides are engaged in fierce fighting day and night. On the 15th, the enemy's front line was forced to retreat somewhat. Up to recently, the results of the fighting in that area have been 2,000 enemy killed or wounded. To reverse the tide, the enemy launched an attack on the vicinity of Brunei Bay on the northwest coast of Borneo with more than 50 ships at noon on the 7th. At approximately 12:30 PM on the 8th, they began landing on nearby small islands. The enemy forces landing this time are the 9th Australian Division. Japanese forces in that area are currently fighting fiercely to intercept them. Furthermore, the air raids around Balikpapan are intensifying daily. On the 15th, approximately twenty enemy ships appeared.

Burma: At the time of the rainy season, the enemy's offensive is still fierce, with a total force of eleven to thirteen divisions. In the area southeast of Mandalay, in the vicinity of Loi-Lem Range, Japanese troops are intercepting the enemy, who has been attempting to invade the Japanese positions northeast of that area since the end of May, and also attempting to cut off the highway connecting Toungoo directly to Thailand. The Japanese army fought bravely and foiled their attempt. There has been little change in the area of the mouth of the Sittang River recently.

New Guinea: On the 5th, Japanese troops in the Uto northern coastal area attacked enemy troops near the Mafi airfield, causing great confusion to the enemy.

Indian Ocean: On the 13th, a small Japanese warship engaged an enemy destroyer near Sabang.

### Tarakan Residents Cooperate with Japanese Forces

Southwest Pacific Base, 17th, Central News Agency: Mr. Ishibashi Yoshito of the film distribution company, who departed from Tarakan Island before the enemy American forces landed and crossed eastern Borneo, recently arrived locally and spoke of the high morale of the Japanese soldiers in Tarakan, the enthusiastic spirit of the overseas residents, and the cooperation of the East Indian Indonesians as follows:

The enemy began indiscriminately bombing Tarakan in March, and in April, they targeted Japanese coastal defense lines in an attempt to land. At this time, the Japanese garrison had prepared a defense line as solid as iron. Japanese overseas residents formed a volunteer corps, and worked together with the soldiers to conduct assault training, strengthen fortifications, and repair airfields. The soldiers all held a firm belief in victory and a fervent fighting spirit to annihilate the enemy. This spirit of certain victory reflected the national consciousness of the indigenous youth, who recognized the enemy's subversive activities against Japan and shouted "We will defend our homeland together with Japan!" After the implementation of the volunteer soldier system, they enthusiastically joined. Furthermore, the general indigenous residents are also no less committed than the volunteers, continuing to struggle in constructing fortifications, repairing airfields, digging air-raid shelters, and increasing food production. During my crossing of the island of Borneo, I visited the Dayak tribal villages. The Dayak people are no less committed than the residents of Tarakan, and are all cooperating with the Japanese side.

### American Submarine Sinks Soviet Ship

Sapporo, 17th, Central News Agency: The Soviet ship "Taras Barldo" sank on the 12th at dawn, while sailing west through the Soya Strait, after being torpedoed by an American or Chinese submarine. Ninety-nine passengers boarded five lifeboats. Four of the drifting boats were discovered and rescued by nearby Japanese patrol boats on the 14th and 15th, and are currently receiving preferential protection from the Japanese side.

### Toshio Hirashima Appointed Vice President of South Manchuria Railway

Tokyo, 17th, Central News Agency: Following the appointment of Mr. Motoki Yamazaki as President of South Manchuria Railway, the cabinet appointed Toshio Hirashima, director of Manchuria Electric Power Company, as Vice President on the 17th.

### Three-Power Conference Location Will Be Potsdam

London, 17th, Central News Agency: According to the London Times diplomatic correspondent today, Potsdam, the former palace of the German emperors, will be the site of the British, American, and Soviet leaders' meeting. Potsdam is only fifteen kilometers from Berlin.

### Japanese Prime Minister Suzuki and Entourage Visit Atsuta Shrine

Nagoya, 17th, Central News Agency: Japanese Prime Minister Suzuki and his entourage visited Atsuta Shrine at 3:30 PM on the 16th. They also visited a certain Aichi clock factory and a discussion meeting held by the Governor-General. At the meeting, the Prime Minister delivered a speech, encouraging them to take on the mission of "Production is Defense" under the increasingly fierce air raids in the future, and to further enhance their fighting spirit, etc.

### London Times Comments on US Policy Towards Chongqing

Tokyo, 17th, Central News Agency: The English-language Times newspaper in this area criticized the arguments recently published in an American magazine by Nelson, the former Special Envoy to China of the former US President, in its editorial on the 16th as follows: Nelson's request for aid to Chongqing is a "profitable investment" for the United States. This indicates America's intentions toward China and its American national character of seeking nothing but private gain and reward. Nelson argues that the United States must assist in the industrialization of China and in Sino-American joint ventures in the Chinese textile industry, etc., so that American capital can join Chinese enterprises. He also proposed that the US investment amount should initially be 60% to 70%, but that the right to gradually buy out the Chinese within ten years. However, whether America's plan for domination can continue for this ten-year period is a major question. During this period, the United States will inevitably launch various new efforts to strengthen its dominance. As Nelson desires, if China becomes the key to modern industry, the manipulation and control of the main parts will be completely taken under its control. This is as clear as looking at a fire. The industrialization of China that the United States is attempting is nothing more than to obtain the benefits that Nelson expects, but it is unknown whether the outcome will have an adverse impact on the American economy. Because the United States only knows that due to the industrialization of China, a smooth market can be opened up for its own post-war surplus production, but if China becomes an industrial country, it will also be enough to drive out the sales of American goods. Because of the large-scale appearance of Chinese products, China is obviously no longer a market for American goods, but instead becomes a formidable competitor to the United States. This is something that should be worried about for the future of the United States. Therefore, Nelson's so-called "profitable investment" not only shows the selfish motives of the United States towards Chongqing, but also is only obsessed with immediate interests. For example, "To kill the hen that lays the golden eggs," is an equally foolish thing, so what the United States is doing is a shortsighted policy.

Editorial

### What Young Students Should Do During the Summer Vacation

Time flies, and the summer vacation is here again in an instant. According to past experiences, most young students easily waste and squander their precious time during these few dozens of days of summer vacation, which is extremely regrettable, in accordance with the ancient people's teaching of cherishing every inch of time. Moreover, in this extraordinary period, we are worried that our own time is not enough to allocate, and we have not been able to do as much beneficial work for the country and society as possible. In principle, there should be no more of this kind of waste of summer vacation. Furthermore, in terms of Shanghai's special environment, there are too many factors that can tempt young people into decadence, corruption, and depravity. Usually, there are still many young people who do not cherish themselves, go astray, and neglect their studies. Once the formal vacation arrives, they inevitably act like birds out of a cage. Even fathers and elder brothers are often unable to restrain them. Therefore, we are specifically raising the issue of what young students should do during the summer vacation today, hoping that all young students will know how to cherish themselves.

In this extraordinary period, young students, who are the mainstay of the future country and society, should not waste a single day or moment on playful and useless things. Of course, any kind of proper entertainment is acceptable, but things like the recent popular college student carnival dance "対派" should be regarded as shameless behavior of young people, and they should strictly guard against them. Fathers and elder brothers must not indulge them out of momentary doting, and classmates and friends should also encourage each other and cheer up.

Passively refraining from doing useless things is certainly not enough for the young people of the new era. They must actively do things that are beneficial to their studies and to the society and the country. We believe that the following matters are worth considering by ambitious young students as a reference for their summer work.

First is the practice of the university students going to the countryside movement. As much as possible, students from one grade, one school, or several schools, should jointly go to the countryside, either just for a short fact-finding trip, or for organized and planned rural visits and investigation and propaganda work. The so-called fact-finding, visits and investigation, are to seek a deep understanding of what problems exist in the current countryside, and to understand the hardships and demands of the farmers, so as to provide relevant authorities and agricultural groups with a basis for studying countermeasures. As for the so-called propaganda, in addition to explaining the government's laws and regulations for the countryside, such as explaining current affairs trends, helping farmers solve some literacy difficulties, promoting common-sense summer hygiene in rural areas, and donating necessary medicines, are all methods of rural propaganda. In addition, contacting teachers and students in the original schools in the countryside to hold discussion meetings, and holding summer classes and literacy classes in various villages and towns, are also possible and meaningful work.

Secondly, if young students are unable to go to the countryside for various reasons and stay in Shanghai for the summer, they can also carry out the above-mentioned summer service. On the other hand, students can use the vacation to organize collective self-study and tutoring groups to exchange ideas with each other and learn from each other in preparation for the next semester's studies. At the same time, the compulsory curriculum in ordinary school education is often too heavy, and they often lack basic literacy in current affairs and world knowledge. They should immediately use the summer vacation to gather classmates, establish current affairs research classes, etc., and invite those familiar with current affairs to serve as temporary lecturers, and study together to seek a more accurate understanding of the true situation of the current situation.

We pay attention to the trends of Japanese young students. In this extraordinary period, they have long since had no vacation, and are training and struggling in learning and work day and night. This spirit is even more worthy of our young students to emulate quickly.

Travel News

### Impressions of Eastern Zhejiang (4) – Ningbo Today

— Yifei

The reporter stayed in Baiguan Town for two days. The bus to Ningbo only started running on May 22nd, but there was only one (usually two buses run together). Because travelers passing through had been arriving in the town continuously for days, more than fifty people were standing in one truck. The crowding was no different from a can of sardines.

Baiguan to Ningbo

The day before leaving the town, people in the inn were selling bus tickets at a price more expensive than the original price (13,000 yuan) by charging a "handling fee" of 2,500 yuan. About a hundred people claimed that if they didn't buy tickets through them, there would be fewer buses the next day and it would be difficult to get on. The travelers believed it and entrusted them to handle it. The next day, before the travelers boarded the bus, they each received a train ticket from the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Bureau. When the bus arrived at Cixi Station, the ticket checker asked the travelers to change buses (at that time, there was another truck not affiliated with the company following closely behind). About forty people were asked to change buses, with only a few travelers remaining in the original bus. Then, the ticket checker took out another ticket, punched holes in it one by one, and told the travelers to throw away the previous "fake tickets," and informed the travelers of the name of the boarding station on the official ticket. At this point, the travelers finally realized that they had all become "yellowfish passengers" (commonly known as privately carrying passengers). Afterwards, it was learned that these railway staff colluded with local ruffians. With two buses running every morning, the income from "catching yellowfish" was about 1.2 million yuan. If this is the case, the company's losses must be considerable.

The bus departed at 2:30 PM. Along the way, the farmers' residences were mostly two-story buildings. In the area around Wujian (about 30 li from Baiguan), tender greenery covered the fields. Small villages were built against the mountains, and grazing cattle were visible everywhere. This proves the prosperity of the area. The journey took five hours, passing through Anting, Mazhu, Yuyao, Shushan, Zhangting, Yejią, Cixi, Hongtang, Zhuangqiao, and finally arriving at Ningbo.

Visiting County Magistrate Yuan

Ningbo's city streets are bustling and prosperous. It is the largest city in Eastern Zhejiang. Dongmen Street (i.e., Zhongshan East Road) is the local downtown area, with many shoe stores, jewelry stores, and silk shops. At the eastern end, Heyi Road is where "Tizhuang" (shipping agencies) are concentrated, while banks and money houses are mostly located in the Jiangdong Town area.

The current County Magistrate of Yin County is Mr. Yuan Duanfu, a local gentleman. Mr. Yuan served as the chairman of the Chamber of Commerce for a long time. On April 9th of this year, he was recommended by local gentry and businessmen to serve as the local official because he was a local. The reporter visited him on May 24th and was received. Mr. Yuan had white hair and was clearly a kind and honest elder. He gave a very detailed account of the recent situation in Yin County.

According to County Magistrate Yuan, the entire county is divided into ten districts and ninety-one townships, totaling 1,462 bao, 14,124 jia, 153,124 households, and a total population of 621,599. Previously, in March, there was only one district office set up in the urban area of Yin County. Now, in order to promote county administration and consolidate public security, it has been divided into five district offices, namely Districts 1 to 5. Each district is divided into three towns, and the number of bao belonging to each town varies. The most is Donghu Town, with 75 bao, and the least is the Northern Suburb Town, with only 14 bao, followed by the Southern Suburb Town, with only over 20 bao. The entire urban area of fifteen towns has 532 bao, 5,140 jia, 54,333 households, and a population of 228,316. Districts 6 to 10 are rural areas, with a total of 76 townships, 903 bao, 8,984 jia, 98,791 households, and a population of 393,283.

People's Food and Grain Production

When the reporter arrived in Ningbo, rice prices were soaring, and the public was as panicked about food as in Shanghai. According to Mr. Yuan, the Grain Association had previously been ineffective, and many powerful rice shops in the county had not participated. Now, they have all been invited to participate in order to solve the problem of people's food supply, and a Grain Management Committee has been established. The committee is responsible for rationing rice to civil servants and military police, with the former paying 5,000 yuan per shi and the latter 3,000 yuan per shi.

In the past, the amount of rice produced in Yin County each year was only enough to feed the local population for nine months. Now, in order to promote increased rice production, the county government is encouraging farmers in the four rural areas to convert rush grass fields and lean paddy fields to grow japonica rice. The situation is expected to improve in the future.

Before the incident, Yin County had 600,000 mu of farmland, but now there are only over 400,000 mu. Only over 100,000 mu can be taxed. The revenue from land tax for the 33rd year (1944) has already ended. The total collected for both the upper and lower terms was 10,095,6240 yuan, and the tax rate was 60 yuan per mu. The method of distribution is in accordance with the regulations of the provincial government. Two percent is set aside as "collection expenses," and the remaining amount is divided between the province and the county at a ratio of 4:6. It is estimated that about 3,500,6000 yuan should be turned over to the provincial government.

Reorganizing the Self-Defense Corps

Public security in Ningbo has not yet been established. Robberies occur from time to time, and the trend of highway robbery was rampant last winter. In order to enable the people to assist the military and police in maintaining local security, the county government has reorganized the long-suspended Self-Defense Corps, strengthened its organization, and taken the Youth Corps as the backbone, leading and promoting personnel from the baojia system. It began its work on May 20th and will begin performing its duties on June 1st. The long-chaotic public security of Yin County may gradually become stable in the future.

Current Status of the Financial Industry

During the reporter's stay in Yin, I visited the local financial community. Ningbo is the transfer station for local products from Jinhua, Lanxi, and other places to be transported to Shanghai for sale. At that time, cotton, medicinal materials, and grass mats from Sanbei in Yuyao were also major export commodities. Now, because cotton has been controlled, other commodities such as mats are subject to seasonal factors, and sales of medicinal materials in Shanghai have stagnated, resulting in a sharp decline in export volume.

When Ningbo's foreign trade was at its most prosperous, the financial community was thriving, with more than 80 money shops and a dozen banks, with the Central Bank of China, Bank of Communications, Farmers Bank of China, and Bank of China leading the way.

After the incident, almost all the silver and money industries closed down. In the early days, only a few small money shops, resembling small stalls, appeared, but their business never got on track. It was not until the establishment of the Financial Inspection Office of the Central Reserve Bank in July of the year before last (1943), and the start of verification of the capital of various banks and money shops and the issuance of business licenses in April of last year, that the business of the local silver and money industry began to get back on track.

Currently, Ningbo has the Central Reserve Bank, the Yokohama Specie Bank, and the Zhejiang Provincial Bank. Among these three types of banks, the Central Reserve Bank is in a leading position, the Yokohama Specie Bank mainly handles receipts and payments for Allied military units, and the Zhejiang Provincial Bank is the agent for the provincial and county treasuries.

Recently, there are 29 money shops, with Defeng as the giant (founded by Mr. Li Zulai), followed by Huifeng, Mingji, Zhihong, Jianhua, and other shops. The capital of each money shop is generally above 10 million yuan.

The business of these money shops mainly focuses on credit overdrafts and discount bills. For example, on May 26th, the interest rate on overdrafts was 1.2 fen, and the discount rate was about 4,500 yuan for every 100,000 yuan for a ten-day period.

Each money shop has different customers. For example, Defeng mainly serves the cigarette and grocery industries, while Jianhua mainly targets the jewelry industry. Only Mingji and Zhihong have a wider scope. The amount of bank loans is very small, limited to 200,000 yuan.

Education Sector Salaries

There are more than 30 public primary schools and 20 private primary schools in Yin County. There are three provincial women's high schools and provincial normal schools. The private schools include Qiushi High School, Jisi High School, Yucai High School, and Qizhen High School. Qizhen High School has the most students, with 900, and the normal school has the least, with only over 20 students.

There is a big difference in the treatment of teachers in public and private schools. In public schools, high school teachers receive 80 yuan per hour, and junior high school teachers receive 60 yuan per hour. In addition, each semester, they only receive 1.5 dou of "teacher appreciation rice" provided by the students. Previously, the government also allocated rice, two dou per month, which was later reduced to one dou, and recently, starting in May, it has been completely cancelled.

Among the private high schools, the treatment of teachers at "Qiushi" is the best. According to the school's regulations, each student pays more than 7 dou of rice per semester. The school has 9 faculty members and 215 students. Thus, each teacher, in addition to the necessary expenses, can receive an average of 17 or 18 shi of rice per semester.

The next best is the private Qizhen High School. Teachers' salaries are calculated in terms of rice, that is, about 1 sheng of rice per hour. Assuming that a teacher teaches an average of 40 hours per month, they can receive about 5 dou of rice per month. Compared to the meager treatment of teachers in public schools, it is really incomparable.

The lives of teachers in public schools are difficult. However, principals are mostly exceptions. Some principals have ways to make money, such as collecting tuition in advance, collecting retention fees, falsely reporting the number of students and grade levels, and even demolishing and selling school property to enrich their own pockets. Such incidents occur frequently. Recently, even the Xue Lou (a library built by Xue Fucheng, who served as the Ningbo Taoist and British minister in the Qing Dynasty) behind Zhongshan Park, which has historical value, was demolished and sold at a low price.

Cooperative Enterprises

There are currently two cooperatives in Yin County, one is the "Yin County Branch of the China Cooperative," and the other is the "Ningbo Aquatic Products Cooperative of the China Cooperative." These two cooperatives are parallel organizations. The former began preparations in October of the 30th year (1941). At that time, its name was "Yin County Tenth District Rural Production and Marketing Cooperative." The following year, in January, it expanded its scope and changed its name to "Ningbo Cooperative." It began to coordinate the daily necessities of its members, with soap, candles, vegetable oil, beans, and salt being the main items. On June 10th of the same year, it was ordered to use its current name. The cooperative currently has 29,588 member households, with 21,144 shares (i.e., shares). The total amount of funds is 2,222,800 yuan. Over the years, in addition to handling the distribution of goods, it also established a mountain products department in Yinjianqiao in the 32nd year (1943) to sell tea, created a model farm, widely promoted and improved agricultural products, and established an agricultural training class to cultivate agricultural talent. In the past, the cooperative's business was quite active. In October of last year, due to the refund of shares to non-agricultural members (the cooperative had more merchants than farmers), it caused a shortage of funds. In addition, the sources of allocated goods were scarce, leading to a suspension, and the cooperative's affairs were also at a standstill. Recently, with nothing to do, all the funds and borrowed funds have been used to provide small agricultural loans ranging from 10,000 yuan to 50,000 yuan. The loan limit for last year's agricultural loans was 1,000 yuan to 5,000 yuan. A total of 2.3 million yuan was lent out during the spring plowing season (March).

The Fisheries of Eastern Zhejiang

The Aquatic Products Cooperative was established in November of the 30th year (1941), originally named "Ningbo Aquatic Products Cooperative Limited." The cooperative now has a fish market in Jiangxia Street. The cooperative's marine products department has 34 brokers, with capital ranging from 5 million to 10 million yuan, while the river products department has only a dozen or so people, with capital ranging from several hundred thousand to one million yuan.

In January of this year, someone in Ningbo organized the "Eastern Zhejiang Fish Market" to monopolize the fishing industry, which greatly affected the cooperative's business, almost to the point of suspension. In March, the central government explicitly banned it. The Aquatic Products Cooperative is also actively reorganizing.

The annual fishing season in Eastern Zhejiang is in March, April, May, and August. Most of the fishermen belonging to Ningbo live in Meiyue, Taogong Mountain, Yinjiawan, and other places. By county, the number of fishermen is led by "Dinghai," with about 40,000 people. In the Taizhou area, "Wenzhen" has the most, with about 10,000 people. In the Wenzhou area, "Yuhuan" has the most, with more than 24,000 people. The total number of fishermen in Zhejiang Province is 150,000.

The fishing grounds are in Shenjiamen, Xiangshan Port, Daishan, Shipu, and other places. The total number of fishing vessels used by fishermen in Zhejiang Province is about 27,000 (more than 25,000 for offshore use and the rest for inland rivers). Most of the vessels are owned by the fishermen themselves, but some also rent them from shipyards in advance. When fishermen lack funds, they used to borrow from brokers. Now, in order to promote the welfare of fishermen, the cooperative has set up fishermen's welfare primary schools and fishermen's clinics (Dalaike Street, Ningbo) and provides loans, which has become one of the cooperative's main businesses.

### Tensions Suddenly Escalate Between France and Spain

Blue Uniform Army Train Attacked

Lisbon, 17th (Central News Agency) – According to a London dispatch, earlier reports stated that the French attacked a train carrying several teams of Spanish "Blue Uniform Army" from Switzerland, causing tensions to suddenly escalate between Spain and France. Detailed information about the beginning and end of the disaster has not yet been received, but according to initial reports, about 1,000 members of the French "Resistance Party" suddenly attacked a train carrying 1,000 Spanish "Blue Uniform Army" while it was stopped at the Genblen Station yesterday. It is reported that the Spanish troops were returning to their country from Switzerland after fighting with Soviet forces. The report also stated that the train was carrying many French soldiers from the former Vichy government. Twelve people died and one hundred were seriously injured.

### Indian Governor-General Invites Leaders to Hold Talks

Lisbon, 17th (Central News Agency) – According to reports from New Delhi, Indian Governor-General Lord Wavell replied to Quaid-i-Azam Jinnah, President of the All-India Muslim League, yesterday, stating that it is not appropriate to convene talks before Indian leaders hold a meeting in Simla. Our talks can be tentatively scheduled for June 25th.

Bela Issues Warning to Britain

Lisbon, 17th (Central News Agency) – According to reports received here, Indian industrial leader Bela recently went to Britain to inspect the industrial situation for the development of Indian industry. He suddenly made a threatening speech in London, stating that if British industrialists hope to manage post-war Indian industry, India will seek industrial markets elsewhere. India must control its own created businesses and is unwilling to share this management power with other countries under any circumstances, and would rather pay any price to obtain sophisticated industrial technology. Now we have to appeal to British industry, hoping to complete the development of our India, otherwise our India will find a way out elsewhere, and at that time, both India and Britain may not benefit.

### Mexican Ambassador to Chongqing Takes Office

Lisbon, 17th (Central News Agency) – The first Mexican Ambassador to Chongqing, General Yescalante, is scheduled to leave for Chongqing on the 17th to take office.

### Leopold to Return Home, Belgian Cabinet Resigns En Masse – Britain Feels Anxious About Belgian Political Situation

Lisbon, 17th (Central News Agency) – A dispatch from Brussels states that the Belgian cabinet resigned en masse on the 16th. Regarding this matter, the Belgian Information Bureau issued the following statement: Belgian King Leopold will soon return home. The government resigned en masse because it could not bear the political situation after the king's return. We advocate establishing a new government before the king's return. Regarding the issue of King Leopold's abdication, the Belgian royalists and socialists have opposing opinions. The former hopes for the king's return, while the socialists strongly demand the king's abdication. The current cabinet is in a dilemma, so it resigned en masse.

Lisbon, 17th (Central News Agency) – According to Reuters: The decision of King Leopold to return to Belgium is recognized by authoritative circles in London as a serious matter in Belgium. Diplomatic and political authorities are also quite anxious about this matter. The return of King Leopold will cause the overall unity of Belgium to suddenly become divided, because the king's return will clearly prove the establishment of a monarchy, which will arouse the enthusiastic feelings of the Belgian people who have been quiet for months.

### Japanese Youth Fully Demonstrate Combat Power

On the Okinawa Island front, the offensive and defensive battle between the Japanese and American armies has entered a critical stage. Relying on its massive material resources, the enemy America has continuously resupplied the American troops on the Okinawa front line, but the enemy America's fierce offensive has been repeatedly frustrated. Recently, the famous Japanese writer Kagehei Hino went to the base of the special attack team to welcome the special attack team's departure to carry out the general attack, and had a dialogue with the members of the Asahi Shimbun special reporter Saito Shinya reporting team. The following is a record of the conversation between the two.

Special Attack Team Members Determined

Hino: Yes, we often use the words "youth" and "youth power," but after touring various base bodies, I deeply feel the true strength of youth.

This time, in order to see the situation when the general attack was launched, I visited the relevant base. The special attack team members I saw were only 18 or 19 years old. Although there were also 25 to 27-8-year-olds who were students in the team leader or cadre team, their mood was no different from that of the average young team member. Moreover, the meaning of "youth" does not only refer to young age, but also has the meaning of "Japanese youth" or "determined thinking," doesn't it?

Saito: I think so too. Watching the special attack heroes charge forward one after another, one cannot help but deeply feel that this war will definitely be won. I joined the army in Okinawa before the enemy landed, and during that time I visited various bases. What I saw was the special attack team as the main body. The vigor of morale and the tranquility of departure were truly moving and indescribable. Their mentality is just like starting a 100-meter race, happily moving forward towards the goal.

Hino: This kind of mood must be unconscious even to the special attack team members themselves. Even if they know it, its profound mystery cannot be expressed. Isn't this a wonderful mystery? This must be the advantage of the Japanese people.

When I met a certain lieutenant from Waseda University, it was truly like meeting an old friend in a foreign land, and I was very happy. His smiling face made me feel a little dazed. When he handed me his wallet and asked me to donate it for him, his words moved me even more. He said, "Money is not needed in the underworld, and the ferry money for the Sanzu River (i.e., the Yin-Yang River) is not the same as the tickets used. If I take this money with me, it will only make Japan poorer, so I'm sorry, please donate it to the country for me." What else can we onlookers say to this kind of intention!

No Thoughts of People, Only Victory

Saito: In short, there is no other thought in mind. The only thing in mind is to strive for victory.

Hino: At the base, when the special attack team members said goodbye to their parents, there was no particularly tragic impression given to people. The family members did not have a particularly solemn expression, and the team members were laughing and joking, maintaining this mood until the time of departure.

However, the problem is purely with the aircraft. On the front-line base, the most important thing is the aircraft. When the base is bombed by enemy aircraft, the first priority is to protect the aircraft on the ground and ensure that they are not damaged. This is done very thoroughly. What is pleasing after inspecting the base is that the damage to the aircraft is unexpectedly rare and does not affect the attack at all. From the overall battle, there is no obstacle. This makes people feel the reliability of "the base is healthy." I firmly believe that as long as the aircraft, which is the crystallization of the energy of the rear, is sent one by one, we will surely be able to win this great decisive battle.

Saito: The base commander also said that one aircraft now is better than ten aircraft in the future. I think it is not right to disappoint the special attack team. I remember that one day when a certain base was bombed by enemy aircraft, a certain special attack team member's aircraft was unfortunately damaged. He was very frustrated because he would have difficulty participating in the attack, and he did not smile until he obtained a spare aircraft.

Strive for Aircraft Production

Hino: As long as there are aircraft, we can win. This is something that people in the rear fully know. However, I think, should the view on aircraft consumption be renewed now? For example, "one aircraft, one warship," sinking ten warships requires ten aircraft, and even more during other sorts of consumptions.

Saito: This great decisive battle will end with an air war, this can be said to be the conclusion. Therefore, we must faithfully do "ten aircraft tomorrow are not as good as one aircraft today" regardless of any sacrifice. I hope that the leaders in the rear and the cadres on the production front will double their efforts!

(Note) Hino Kahei is currently entrusted to the Western Army by the Army Reporting Team, while Saito, a member of the Reporting Team, was stationed with the army in Okinawa before the enemy America landed, and recently took on a new task and returned to this base. (Translated from Asahi Shimbun)

### This City's Banking and Money Exchange Businesses to Change Business Hours Starting Today: 9:00 AM to 1:00 PM

The joint conference of banking and money exchange businesses in this city has decided that, starting from the 18th of this month (today), the business hours for all banks and money exchanges will be uniformly changed to 9:00 AM to 1:00 PM. The clearing time for negotiable instruments will be changed to 12:00 noon for banks, and starting at 12:00 noon for money exchanges (same on Saturdays). At the same time, detailed regulations have been separately stipulated regarding the time for presenting various negotiable instruments, as well as for returning items, misplaced items, and the time for customers to deposit instruments for collection. The details are as follows:

Bankers' Association

The Joint Reserve Council of Banking Businesses has revised the time for entrusted collection of various negotiable instruments by member businesses: For negotiable instruments that can be submitted for clearing by the association (i.e., clearing bank and payment instruments of banks entrusted to the association to act as clearing agents): (A) Banks entrusted to this association to act as clearing agents, member businesses with transactions with the association, before 11:00 AM. (B) All money exchanges, before 12:00 noon. (All money exchanges send three-part remittance receipts to the reserve treasury.) Payment instruments of member money exchanges of the Money Exchange Association, clearing banks, before 12:00 noon. (All banks send three-part remittance receipts to the money treasury for collection.) Payment instruments of member businesses with transactions with the association, banks entrusted to this association to act as clearing agents, before 11:00 AM. Payment instruments of foreign banks, member businesses with transactions with the association, before 10:30 AM. (For those received on the previous day, please send them to the association before 5:00 PM that afternoon.) Payment instruments of this association, after the daily clearing time, sent to the association by member businesses for transfer: (A) Clearing banks, (B) Banks entrusted to this association to act as clearing agents, (C) Member businesses with transactions with the association, (D) All money exchanges, all before 2:00 PM, customers of money exchanges use three-part remittance (receipts sent to the reserve council). Note: Please strictly adhere to the above-listed collection times, and no exceptions will be made for late submissions. Returned items after clearing by member businesses, and those collected on behalf of this association, should be returned to this association by 5:00 PM that afternoon. No exceptions will be made for late submissions. They should be handled directly between the returning bank and the original collecting bank, and this association will not be responsible. The time for misplaced instruments between banks and money exchanges is up to 12:00 noon. The above times have been approved and implemented by the council of the association. The handling of returned items on the Bund will still be handled according to the original method, and the time remains the same.

Money Reserve Treasury

The Joint Reserve Treasury of Money Exchange Businesses has revised the methods for collecting and paying instruments by member businesses: Banks collect money exchanges', money exchanges entrust banks to collect payment instruments, time for sending to the treasury association, before 12:00 noon. Treasury association's payment dispatches are deposited in the treasury association. Remittances from the Central Reserve Bank and bank drafts sent to the treasury are all before 2:00 PM. Payment instruments of foreign banks sent to the treasury, 1:00 PM to 2:00 PM (entered into the next day's accounts). Mutual instruments between banks and money exchanges, up to 12:00 noon. Member businesses exchanging drafts with customers or mutual allocations between businesses, up to 1:00 PM. Returned items and late arrivals at the treasury association, before 5:00 PM. Note: All businesses should strictly adhere to the above-stated times. The treasury association will not make any exceptions for late submissions. Clearing staff should be punctual and adhere to the time. If there are late arrivals or absences, the treasury will impose penalties according to the regulations. For instruments deposited by customers with member businesses, subject to the restrictions of the current day's accounts, all instruments deposited by customers for collection on the same day are limited to the amount that can be received on the same day. (Generally, the standard is for member businesses in the central district to collect up to 10:30 AM. Member businesses should determine this themselves based on their location and business conditions.) Any deposits made after this time that cannot be submitted for clearing or collection will be entered into the next day's accounts. If there are any conflicts with the current temporary measures for banking and money exchange businesses during air raid alerts, these measures shall be handled in accordance with this method.

### Last Week's Financial Market Situation: Still Unstable; Prices of Rice Flour and Grains Show a Decline

The financial and industrial and commercial market situation in this city has been unstable in the recent week amidst torrential storms. However, due to the approaching Dragon Boat Festival, industrial and commercial businesses are handling current account settlements, and banking and money exchange businesses are also tightening their positions. The money supply is tight and loose at times, and the market situation is evolving slightly slower. Except for the large increase in the price of Chih-fu silver public bonds and enemy currency, Chinese stocks have shown a decline. In particular, small and medium-sized stocks have experienced a severe decline. Three hot stocks, Mei Ah, Wing On, and Cotton Mill, rose first and then declined. The market opened higher at the beginning of the week and then generally declined slightly, but the three hot stocks rose again. Many bullish companies tried their best to raise and absorb them. The market was firm on Tuesday and continued to decline on Wednesday. Retail investors panicked, and the money supply was tight the day before the festival, so they sold out one after another, dumping their holdings at low prices, with a tendency to be unstoppable. The market was still lifeless on Wednesday, and people's hearts were restless. The selling trend was still strong. Although the decline continued in the morning, there was a rebound in the afternoon. The market was closed on Thursday for the Dragon Boat Festival. The market was good when it opened on Saturday, and the stock market had an upward trend. Unexpectedly, it was shrouded in some rumors in the middle, and the money supply tightened again due to the shortening of business hours of banking and money exchange businesses. Bulls dumped their holdings, and the bearish trend suddenly rose. The three hot stocks and small and medium-sized stocks all declined in a straight line, with a tendency to be on a downward spiral, and people's hearts became more and more tired. It is because after the bulls dumped their stocks, they transferred their funds to buy Chih-fu, forming a phenomenon of rising gold and falling stocks. The half-day market on Saturday was firm, and retail investors absorbed at low prices. Bulls held on and were unwilling to sell at low prices, so the market rebounded at the close. As for the industrial and commercial sectors, the soaring prices of gold and rice stimulated various major and minor commodities to run up together. The prices of goods in the stores of various companies and businesses are revised and increased every day. Ordinary salaried people are suffering endlessly. The price of rice has risen by as much as 500,000 to 600,000 yuan in a week. Fortunately, the government authorities took emergency measures to suppress and stabilize rice prices and dredge the sources, stopped buying military rice, and lifted restrictions on the movement of rice and grains, allowing merchants and people to freely transport it. The panic of the people's food was immediately suppressed. On Friday, the rise stopped and fell back. On Saturday, the top-quality Du Bai rice fell from a peak of one million yuan to about 860,000 yuan. Soybean oil fell by 70,000 yuan per load, and the top-quality white flour fell to 180,000 yuan per bag. Other miscellaneous grains also showed a decline. The general public hopes that the government's economic authorities will take emergency measures to stabilize people's livelihoods, closely monitor speculators and merchants, and contact financial institutions to secretly hoard major food commodities with loans and crack down on secretly raising market prices, so that commodity prices will not experience a sharp increase again.

### Volleyball Women's Group Finale: Huayan vs. Xinben; Group A Zhongbei vs. White Team

The Shanghai Volleyball League has been going on since it opened on the 26th of last month. After three weeks of competition, Group A has only two games left. Only Huayan vs. Xinben remains in the women's group. The teams in Group B are at the height of competition and the champion and places are largely decided. The order will be completed by the end of the month. Today's women's group Huayan vs. Xinben from 5:00 is the last game of the season. Three provinces have already won the title in that group, and Xinben has been slightly better than Huayan in recent games. Group A Zhongbei vs. White Team: Zhongbei's lineup is strong and unsurpassable by other teams. Yuan Bingqiu's smashing, Huang Yaoluo's defense, and Li Baozhong's spiking are unmatched by Shanghai soldiers. The White Team is not expected to win. The order today is as follows:

Huayan vs. Xinben (Women's Group) 5:30, Zhongbei vs. White Team (Group A) 6:30.

### Should Schools Implement a Three-Semester System?

-- Ren Min

Curriculum and Teaching Materials: The existing regulations for the courses and teaching materials that students of all levels of schools should study are suitable for a two-semester system. Now, if it is easily changed to a three-semester system, the class time for each semester will be shortened. Is the original curriculum suitable? Can students complete the original teaching materials? If so, the teacher can teach quickly, but in terms of students' learning ability and psychology, this is not appropriate. As a result, should the students' level be lowered?

Tuition Fees: With the implementation of the three-semester system, parents will have to pay an extra semester of tuition for their children each year. At this time of war, I think this will be a problem for most parents. Although their children can graduate one or two years earlier and enter society earlier to share their burden, they have never hoped that. However, the current difficulty - paying extra tuition - is ultimately difficult to overcome; if the tuition for each semester is appropriately reduced, it is certainly possible, but a standard should also be set to not affect teachers' income as a principle.

Unified Implementation: If the system can be implemented, I think this should also be a comprehensive method for the Shanghai education community, promoted by administrative power so that all schools uniformly implement this system. Otherwise, some schools implement a two-semester system, and some schools implement a three-semester system. Problems will arise for the connection of levels, students' enrollment, teachers' teaching, etc., which will inevitably lead to a chaotic phenomenon.

Now that summer vacation is near, should the three-semester system be implemented to adapt to the times and environment? It seems that the education authorities should adopt opinions from all parties, carefully consider, and make a decision as soon as possible.

### American Ideological Problems

— Matsudaira

The foundational ideology of the United States naturally lies in freedom, equality, and independence. During its time as a British colony, America was oppressed and exploited by the British mainland, subjected to harsh levies and meticulous exactions. It harbored deep resentment towards Britain and sought an opportunity to revolt. The outbreak of the French Revolution, with its symbolic banner of liberty, equality, and fraternity, profoundly stimulated the British in America. Consequently, under the leadership of Washington, they took up arms against the British mainland, ultimately achieving independence. Therefore, America's founding ideology rests on freedom, equality, and independence, with its constitution built around these three tenets. In the United States, the constitution prohibits the creation of aristocratic titles like dukes, marquises, earls, viscounts, and barons, which also reflects this foundational ideology.

Contradictions Within Founding Ideology

However, this ideology has long been fraught with internal contradictions. Why do I say this? Because America's position is akin to a shop assistant rebelling against the shop owner, forcibly seizing the owner's land and property and claiming it as their own. While there may have been reasons for this forceful seizure, the shop owner was ultimately left with no recourse. Britain now regrets its actions. After the shop assistant betrayed the shop owner and declared independence, they immediately denounced the master's old shop, discarding all the old habits, family traditions, tastes, and preferences as outdated.

America has become a nouveau riche. As soon as a merchant becomes wealthy, they invariably display the airs of a wealthy businessman. Their food, clothing, decorations, and even their residences become exceedingly extravagant. And after satisfying their basic needs, they pretend to have refined tastes, collecting books, paintings, and antiques. Taking it a step further, they divert funds to charitable and public safety endeavors, seeking fame and reputation and hoping to gain medals and titles. America today is showing such tendencies, reversing its founding ideology by awarding medals and now imitating Britain by creating titles.

British and American Ideologies Cannot Unite

America's fundamental ideology lies in breaking free from British shackles and pursuing freedom, equality, and independence. Therefore, its educational policy also emphasizes this. Books about American history and textbooks used in elementary schools portray the American Revolutionary War as the most righteous act for the sake of humanity. This also reveals why the British and Americans can never truly unite. Americans revere Washington as a god, and even three-year-olds know his name and show respect. However, in American Canada, many children do not know Washington's name. History textbooks used in Canadian elementary schools provide a very brief account of the American Revolutionary War and criticize Washington for betraying the British mainland. The reason why the British and Americans cannot reconcile is therefore quite clear.

America's ideology of freedom, equality, and independence shapes its domestic and foreign policy. We can first observe its domestic politics. Their founding ideology is based on democracy, and their political ideology stems from this. All political institutions are based on this, and all policies are pursued according to this principle. Citizens form political organizations themselves, and representatives of the people operate the government. Apart from adopting a democratic system, it is not much different from other countries. However, America is like the original home of democracy in the world. Even during the Yalta Conference, it mutually agreed with small European countries to adopt democracy to prevent the spread of communist forces. It also encouraged democracy in Chongqing to prevent the tendency of Chongqing's national essence.

Democracy and Material Life

One characteristic of the United States is that when guiding the people, it equates democracy with the American way of life. It believes that the American way of life is the most ideal, with every family equipped with cars and electric refrigerators, where anyone can freely speak their mind, live freely, and enjoy the true pleasures of life. However, this is a grave misconception. Upon closer examination, we cannot conclude that material life is a result of democracy. The abundance of American life is solely due to its vast and fertile lands. Many European countries have no colonies, and even if they adopt democracy, they cannot become as wealthy as the Americans. Yet, America instructs its people in this way. Recently, it told its people that because Germany and Japan threatened American democracy, they must be defeated, explaining that America originally sought freedom and equality in its war of independence, broke away from Britain, and established the American way of life. Therefore, it must rise up to defend against this threat and further extend the American way of life to China and Southeast Asia to improve the lives of the people there. This is utter deception. America fought in Europe because it was threatened! And the Greater East Asia War was fought entirely within the Greater East Asia region, and currently it is being fought in parts of Japanese territory. Japan has never threatened American democracy, but America has threatened Japan's survival. America's expansion of democracy has become interference in the internal affairs of other countries and a threat to the survival of other nations, completely contradicting the essence of democracy.

The Degeneration of the Monroe Doctrine

Furthermore, what ideological principles have arisen from America's founding ideology in its foreign policy? One is the Monroe Doctrine, the second is the Open Door Policy towards China, and the third is the Non-Recognition Doctrine towards Manchuria. The first, the Monroe Doctrine, is a policy towards Europe, stating that America's affairs should be handled freely by Americans, and Europe should not interfere, and America should not interfere in European affairs. This was President Monroe's declaration. The fundamental idea of this doctrine is to block the voice of European countries on the American continent, and it can be said that America completely broke away from Europe and declared independence. In reality, this was a policy of not wanting Europe to interfere in the freedom of America. However, after World War I, when America sent troops, the Monroe Doctrine was self-destructed. The American Senate opposed President Wilson's League of Nations and returned to the previous Monroe Doctrine, adhering to this doctrine until the outbreak of World War II. But after the outbreak of World War II, because America's Lend-Lease Act could not completely separate itself from European issues, it directly intervened in the European war with the opportunity of the Greater East Asia War. Currently, America intervenes in all European issues, even convening the United Nations Conference and creating a world organization. One aspect of America's Monroe Doctrine sternly insists that European countries should not interfere in American issues, while the other aspect completely abandons the attitude of "America does not interfere in European issues." From the perspective of the division of thought among all Americans, there are still those who adhere to the pure Monroe Doctrine, and these are called isolationists. Isolationists have seemingly disappeared on the surface, but the pure Monroe Doctrine still remains in the minds of the people. If America were to weaken and become impoverished, this pure Monroe Doctrine might resurface.

Open Door Policy Towards China

What will happen after the European war comes to an end? America's concern for European issues will naturally diminish, thus creating an objective situation for the revival of the pure Monroe Doctrine. However, America's leaders have paid a heavy price in Europe, completely changed their previous ways, and do not want to return to the pure Monroe Doctrine. They want to revise the Monroe Doctrine. Since last year, various international conferences have been held in the United States, such as the International Monetary Conference, the Dumbarton Oaks Security Conference, and the San Francisco Conference, to get Americans to agree to revising the Monroe Doctrine. Secondly, the "Open Door Policy" came about after the Russo-Japanese War, when various countries demanded concessions and leased territories in China, intending to divide China. US Secretary of State John Hay opposed the great powers making harsh demands on China and advocated that China should open its doors so that all countries would have equal opportunities. Japan and China became semi-colonies to curb the ambitions of other countries, while at the same time Hay hoped that the United States itself would also gain a share of the rights. He distorted the "principle of equality" of the American founding ideology. This Open Door Policy formed the basis of America's policy towards Asia. Any country that attempts to rise in Asia will inevitably conflict with this policy. When the Nine-Power Treaty was signed, this policy was further turned into a treaty, making the ideologies of various countries consistent with the United States. Later, China's independent and sovereign atmosphere became strong, and the rise of Japanese forces after the Manchurian Incident caused flaws in American policy. At that time, the diplomatic policies of Japan and the United States in East Asia were in opposition.

Non-Recognition Doctrine Towards Manchuria

Third is the "Non-Recognition Doctrine towards Manchuria," which can also be said to be a development of the "Open Door Policy." According to them, changes in territory should respect the free will of the people, and changes in territory by force will never be recognized, explaining that this is based on the "principle of freedom." However, the so-called "Open Door Policy" and "Non-Recognition Doctrine towards Manchuria" all contradict and conflict with America's own principles. The first point is why America does not apply the "Monroe Doctrine" in East Asia. If the "Monroe Doctrine" is maintained in Europe, then the "Monroe Doctrine" should also be adopted in East Asia. America does not interfere in East Asia, and East Asia does not interfere in America. Only in this way does it conform to the "principle of equality." Second, America demands that East Asia, especially China, open its doors, but why does it severely restrict East Asians from entering American territory and impose inhumane and unequal treatment on East Asians? How can the oppression of blacks in the United States be explained according to the "equality" principle of the founding ideology? How can the unequal treatment of East Asians be explained?

Again, the Nations Become Colonies

America seeks freedom, equality, and independence, and the nations of the world equally seek freedom, equality, and independence, especially in Southeast Asia, which has been a colony of other countries for more than a century. This time, they have the opportunity to gain independence and enjoy freedom and equality. However, at the San Francisco Conference, America advocated exploiting the independence of these regions and turning them into colonies again, implementing joint management.

In short, America's principles and claims all contradict themselves. However, I believe that such principles and claims will ultimately not be accepted by the people of the world, and there will inevitably be breakdowns. For the progress of mankind, it will also promote its disintegration.
