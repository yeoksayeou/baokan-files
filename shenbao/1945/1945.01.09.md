### Uniting the Two Great Nations to Strive for Final Victory

Remarks by Chief of General Staff Bao Wen-yue

Nanjing, 8th (Central News Agency) – Military Affairs Commission Chief of General Staff Bao Wen-yue and Army Minister Ye Peng made the following remarks on the occasion of the second anniversary of the National Government's entry into the war. Here are the remarks of Chief of General Staff Bao!

Today is the second anniversary of our National Government's entry into the Greater East Asia War, and it is also the decisive period when the Allied Japanese Special Attack Forces are fighting bravely with the enemy on the Philippine battlefield. The fate, rise, and fall of the entire Greater East Asia nation will naturally depend on the final efforts of the two great nations of China and Japan, and the entire East Asian people. In this important period of striving for final victory, if we can fight together with one heart and one mind without懈怠, final victory will undoubtedly belong to us.

For the past hundred years, China has been ravaged and bound by British and American imperialism, sinking deeper and deeper into a colonial status, unable to extricate itself. Fortunately, after the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, Allied Japan annihilated the exploitation of British and American enemies in East Asia for over a hundred years in one fell swoop, and China was able to lift the shackles of all unequal treaties, leaping from a semi-colonial status to an independent and autonomous country. The revival of China and the liberation of East Asia have gradually been realized.

Now, the Greater East Asia War has entered a decisive stage, and the life or death, survival or extinction, victory or defeat of the entire Greater East Asia nation is of utmost importance. Our compatriots throughout the country, especially the soldiers of the army, navy, and air force, in order to avenge the oppression of British and American for over a hundred years, and to thank the Allied government for destroying the British and American, should continue to strive to implement the policy guidelines of "purifying thought," "increasing production," and "ensuring security" as proclaimed by the late Chairman Wang, so as to fulfill our responsibility as the rear area of a participating nation and to assist the Allies in striving for final victory.

Remarks by Army Minister Ye Peng

Army Minister Ye Peng made the following remarks: Today, on the anniversary of our country's entry into the war, I will discuss two key points with the passionate and simple sentiments of our army:

(1) Participating in the war is the duty of a soldier. Since our country's entry into the war, we have fulfilled our obligations and responsibilities in terms of material participation and manpower participation. We should strive to further improve our efforts in both material and manpower participation until we achieve a common victory. However, we have not yet realized our participation in terms of combat power, which is a source of unease for all my comrades. Although our soldiers have been doing their best to maintain security in the rear, we are deeply ashamed of the bloody battles fought by our Allied Japanese soldiers on all fronts. Moreover, fighting is originally the duty of a soldier, and participating in combat power is the duty of a soldier. Therefore, it was the wish of our soldiers from the beginning of our participation in the war to cooperate with bloodshed, and we will further fight in the future.

(2) Fighting to the end is the integrity of a soldier. We are aware that countries such as Romania and Finland betrayed their alliance in the middle of this war, which is a disgrace to those countries. Our country's participation in the war will be forever based on the principle of living and dying together and will never change. This is the consistent spirit of our country from top to bottom. As for our soldiers, we still have the traditional spirit of unchanging righteousness and valor of ancient Chinese warriors, who disregard gains and losses and do not ask about success or failure. Once we have entered the war, we will definitely fight to the end, which is what I can confidently assert.

If we move forward courageously with this spirit, then next year's third anniversary of our country's entry into the war will definitely be the anniversary of the victory of the Greater East Asia War. Its excitement, enthusiasm, joy, and inspiration will be ten or a hundred times greater than today.

### Sino-Japanese Youth to Hold Friendship Meeting

Nanjing, 8th (Central News Agency) – The Capital Youth Revive Asia General Rising Movement Practice Association, in order to unite Sino-Japanese youth, closely connect and cooperate, and enhance friendship, has specifically scheduled a Sino-Japanese Youth Friendship Meeting at 3:00 PM on the 9th in the New Movement Hall. Attendees will include 50 Chinese youth representatives and 40 Japanese youth representatives, totaling 90 people. Leaders of relevant Sino-Japanese agencies and youth corps representatives will be invited to attend and provide guidance, and there will also be entertainment.

### Minister Matsushima Refutes Roosevelt's Speech: Deceitful and Reveals Anxiety Towards the People

President Roosevelt, in his speech to the 79th Congress, mentioned that the American military had achieved great success in the Pacific campaign. In response, Captain Matsushima of the Chinese Fleet Press Department issued the following statement on the 8th:

Roosevelt's Speech

In his speech on the 6th, President Roosevelt, after carefully reading the portion concerning the Greater East Asia War, first boasted about the progress of his operations, calling it the most rapid mobile attack operation in history. Although the enemy was able to advance from one corner of the Eastern Marshall Islands to Leyte Island in the Western Philippines in one year, they only passed through the sea and gained only one corner of Leyte. He now claims that the Eastern and Western Caroline Islands, known as the bastions of the South Sea, and Rabaul, Bougainville, and other strategic points north of New Guinea, as well as key areas in the Marshall Islands, are still in our army's control. The Palau campaign since September 15th of last year has also become a bubble.

Japan, in the early stages of the Greater East Asia War, was able to reap alarming results in just six months, and the enemy sacrificed tremendous lives and material resources, but the harvest was only a very small achievement.

Shameless Boasting

The American military once boasted that they would "spend Christmas in Manila." The American military, who made such boastful remarks, could only welcome it with bitter battles in Leyte and air raids on Mindoro. Furthermore, the American military's operation on Leyte Island is boasted as being based on a new operation plan, which is a blatant lie. It is actually a matter of course for solid operations. Their attempts to capture Palau and Halmahera were nothing more than reckless actions in search of merit, a point I have repeatedly made before. Roosevelt also boasted that the U.S. Navy achieved great results in the Battle of the Philippine Sea. Have our naval and air forces forgotten to include the damage of 270 of their ships and 1,100 aircraft in the statistics? The majority of their elite aircraft carriers have been lost, most of their battleships have been buried in the seabed, and countless lives have been lost. Even now, there are still more than eight divisions on the island of Leyte, but judging from the results, they will suffer appalling losses. Therefore, the American military had to change its planned strategy and risk a sudden entry into Mindoro. Roosevelt also said: "Our people greatly praise the combat power and courage of the soldiers on the front lines, and the people should praise their children and the leaders who guide the U.S. military." Can the world discover the errors in such deceptive words to the people?

The enemy's American contempt for tactics, relying solely on its material resources and manpower, can be said to be a futile waste. When the American people discover this major loss, what face will they have to meet their elders? Although war cannot achieve its goals without sacrifice, it must be understood that the key to using troops is to exchange the greatest effect with the smallest sacrifice.

Assistance to Chongqing

Secondly, the United States' great propaganda about assistance to China is at odds with Chongqing. As far as we know, the large amount of supplies imported from India is not to supply the Chongqing army, but to supply the military needs of the U.S. Air Force stationed in Chongqing. The Chongqing army receives less than one-tenth of it, which is only enough to supply three divisions of the Chongqing army. Therefore, Chongqing has said, "If Roosevelt fulfills his promise of assistance, then important bases such as Guilin and Hengyang will definitely not be lost."

Finally, Roosevelt said of the campaign in Burma: "The British and American armies have gone through countless difficulties in this campaign and have not been able to break through, and must be persevering and enduring to go." This contradicts the enemy's usual exaggerated propaganda, and he has also revealed some truth about this bitter fight. In short, the United States' Pacific campaign is an incomplete and discontinuous "island-hopping operation." Although it managed to occupy one corner of the Philippines, it has already sacrificed tens of thousands of soldiers. Now the battle between East and West is in full swing, and the battle situation between Japan and the United States must be determined by future operations. We see in Roosevelt's speech the attitude of deceiving the people, and it is not difficult to imagine the anxiety in Roosevelt's heart about the war situation.

German Commentary

Berlin, 8th (Central News Agency) – The German News Agency reported that a German Foreign Ministry spokesman said yesterday: President Roosevelt's address to Congress reflects the difficulties of Roosevelt's military, economic, and political situation at the end of his third term. Roosevelt admitted that the U.S. military has suffered setbacks and heavy losses in both Western Europe and the Pacific, and did not mention the duration of the war. Roosevelt pointed out that further major sacrifices must be made and announced the law of forced labor, which has confirmed the effectiveness of the methods adopted by Führer Hitler in his New Year's address. Roosevelt's speech completely exposed that the United States has no war aim, and American political leaders, in order to greed for their own power, do not hesitate to sacrifice their youth on foreign battlefields. If President Monroe knew about this in the afterlife, he would not be able to rest in peace. Roosevelt's hypocrisy has been completely exposed, so the slogan of Germany and Europe is to mobilize all forces to defeat the enemy's plan.

Editorial

### The Third Year of Participation in the War

It has been two years since our country officially declared its participation in the Greater East Asia War. In the past two years, to what extent have we fulfilled our task of participating in the war?

When our government declared its official participation in the war on January 9, 1943, this newspaper sincerely offered two points to the authorities that the people were most concerned about and hoped to emphasize after participating in the war: first, "respect public opinion," and second, "maintain national strength." We also solemnly pointed out that, according to the actual needs of cooperation between China and Japan, the focus of our country's participation in the war is not in the military, but in politics and economics, and in concentrating and developing the national political and economic forces to assist Japan in completing the final victory of the Greater East Asia War.

Last year, on the first anniversary of our participation in the war, we also pointed out three major tasks that should be implemented after the start of the second year of participation in the war: first, the whole country should work together to contribute materials and manpower to cooperate with the Allies in combat; second, to take on greater responsibilities to cooperate in eliminating the remaining forces of Britain and the United States, and to realize the five major綱領 of the Greater East Asia Declaration; third, to improve politics, improve people's livelihoods, and build a unified new China. In order to complete these three major tasks, the most important prerequisite is that the Nanjing National Government must be a strong and powerful government supported by the people – first, to complete the wartime political system, second, to complete the wartime economic system, and third, to complete the wartime cultural education system.

Indeed, our country has exerted some effort in participating in the Greater East Asia War in the past two years. However, upon closer examination, it seems too far from our original ideals. Regarding "respecting public opinion," we have always believed that the establishment of public opinion organs is an indispensable mechanism for official-civilian cooperation, mobilizing people's strength, and leveraging national strength. As for the so-called "maintaining national strength," the foundation of national strength lies in the people, and it must be made possible for the people-based national strength to be inexhaustible and contribute endlessly. This is the true way of maintenance. Looking back at today's declining production and the severe state of people's livelihoods, it seems that the effort to maintain has not been fully exhausted. We really have to worry about the future of national strength.

The failure to achieve perfection in "respecting public opinion" and "maintaining national strength" makes us feel that the failure to achieve the ideal completion of "completing the wartime political system," "completing the wartime economic system," and "completing the wartime cultural education system" pointed out on the first anniversary of the war last year is an important problem. Because the so-called "strong and powerful" is not "strong" enough and not "powerful" enough, therefore, it is still difficult to thoroughly improve politics, it is difficult to improve people's livelihoods, and therefore, it is impossible to perfectly achieve the unity of the country, contribute materials and manpower, and cooperate with the Allies in combat.

Today, at the beginning of the third year of participation in the war, we cannot but solemnly and repeatedly propose the two major points of "respecting public opinion" and "maintaining national strength."

Since the focus of our country's participation in the war is in politics and economics, the so-called "respecting public opinion" aims to promote sincere cooperation between officials and people, and to leverage people's strength, cultivate national strength, and provide economic combat power under a sound and clean government. This year, we must be down-to-earth, not pursuing emptiness, and everyone must forget themselves for the sake of the country, and strive for political clarity and a substantial increase in production. Especially important, politics must be resolutely strengthened, and the economy must have a comprehensive plan, focusing on practical production increase work. We can say that resolutely strengthening politics and formulating concrete production increase plans are the first things to be done at the beginning of the third year of participation in the war, which is a prerequisite for realizing the strength of the people and materials.

### China and Japan Stand Shoulder to Shoulder and Work Together to Ensure Victory: Remarks by Minister Sanpin

Nanjing, 8th (Central News Agency) – Mr. Sanpin Takashi, Press Minister of the Japanese General Army, issued a statement on the second anniversary of China's participation in the war, saying: Allied China has completed three years of participation in the decisive battle for the liberation of Greater East Asia. At a time when the war situation is becoming increasingly fierce, Chinese officials and civilians, in the midst of mourning the passing of Chairman Wang, under the leadership of Acting Chairman Chen, have renewed the face of the National Government. At the same time, they have strengthened the decisive battle system and are moving forward courageously on the road to winning the final victory in order to realize the Three Principles of the People and the late Chairman's legacy, which is what we admire most.

The Greater East Asia War has now entered a decisive stage. We can see two opposing characteristics of the war from the decisive battle situation, namely, the fight for moral necessity and victory, and the speculative adventurous war. From the perspective of China and Japan, this war is a war to determine the fate of their countries and the rise and fall of their nations. The safety of East Asia depends on this battle, so it is a war of righteousness, but from the perspective of the enemy, Britain and the United States, the conduct of the war is an act of overestimating one's abilities, a so-called "scientific adventure," and is only for the pursuit of "speculative profits."

The U.S. Air Force stationed in Chongqing has recently been inhumane, daring to blindly attack Chinese compatriots and turn the ancestral land of the Chinese people into scorched earth. Their unscrupulous style of pursuing profits is evident here. As for Japan's wartime stance, it has been fully demonstrated by the bravery of the members of the Japanese Army and Navy Special Attack Squads. The predatory posture of the Special Attack Squad members searching for enemy ships is the most real and purest wartime posture of Japan. They are all young people, and the 100 million Japanese people are all their brothers, sisters, fathers, brothers, and uncles. Therefore, the Special Attack Squad members' determination, the successive waves, and the smiling devotion to the historical mission are actually Japan's condensation of the blood of 100 million仪民 and the blood of the nation to fight. Japan is currently engaged in this. At the same time, China and Japan are also fighting shoulder to shoulder to ensure victory.

The enemy, Britain and the United States, once boasted that they would plunder and kill Japan from the surface of the earth, and then put shackles on the nations of East Asia, but they only want to exhaust their national strength and sacrifice the blood of our 100 million people. However, it must be known that this is an impossible thing.

Revolutionary Japan and revolutionary China will continue to fight against the enemy, Britain and the United States, who want to trample on the freedom and glory of Asia, even for hundreds or thousands of years.

### Commemoration Ceremonies Held in Various Parts of North China

Beiping, 7th (Central News Agency) – The Central General Association of the New People's Association has decided to expand the commemoration ceremony because the second anniversary of China's participation in the war is approaching in an instant, in order to arouse the national fighting spirit, stimulate the national determination to win, and contribute the total power of the mind and materials to the war. In addition to holding the commemoration ceremony and holding a合唱会 as usual, the Central General Association will also convene a mass rally, inviting Director Guan Yixian of the Information Bureau and Director Gan Jin of the General Administration Propaganda Bureau to attend and give speeches. The association has also formulated the Propaganda Outline for the Second Anniversary of China's Participation in the War, and distributed it to the General Associations of each province and city for implementation at the time. It is expected that the commemorative events will be launched enthusiastically in various parts of China on that day.

### Car License Plates Changed to Use Soybean Substitutes

Clear Proof of U.S. Resource Depletion

Shanghai News Agency – According to reliable sources: A strange thing happened in Springfield, Illinois, USA. Recently, due to the lack of iron-making raw materials in the United States, all car license plates are made of soybean-pressed substitutes. However, it has been found that some car license plates have been swallowed by dogs, causing the owners to have no proof to identify their original vehicles, and even causing lawsuits. This proves that the United States is in a state of frequent resource depletion.

### Fierce Fighting on Luzon Island: Japanese Garrison Awaits with Weapons; Special Attack Units Bomb Enemy Mobile Forces

Tokyo, 8th (Central News Agency) – Enemy forces west of Santo Tomas and Lingayen Gulf on Luzon Island are preparing to land again. Their total strength includes six or seven special aircraft carriers, several cruisers and destroyers, and approximately twenty or thirty ships resembling transport vessels. Separately, the enemy's second convoy is sailing from Mindoro toward Luzon Island, which is believed to be the main force of the enemy convoy. It is difficult to predict whether the mission of this main enemy convoy, composed of about one hundred and several tens of large and small transport ships, is to supply the enemy forces in Lingayen Gulf or to sail to other locations. However, the Japanese army in the Philippines is closely monitoring their movements, awaiting with weapons to counter the enemy's landing attempts.

Lingayen Front, Luzon Island, 8th (Central News Agency) – An enemy escort convoy appeared in Lingayen Gulf on the 6th (the site of the Japanese army's landing three years ago). On the 7th, they repeatedly bombarded the Japanese defense positions along the coasts of San Fernando, Balaoan, and Damortis with naval artillery and carrier-based aircraft. Japanese land forces in various locations also returned fire with heavy artillery, resulting in fierce artillery battles. The enemy's mobile forces were only meters from the shore, led by massive ships resembling battleships or large cruisers. They fired one shell at the coast every two minutes, slowly moving south. After one group passed, another group appeared, continuing the bombardment incessantly. Subsequently, a total of more than seventy enemy ships formed a single column on the azure sea, their flashes of white light shimmering. Japanese army soldiers maintained a strict watch at the coastal positions. A certain unit commander declared, "If enemy warships invade, we will fight to the death." Meanwhile, enemy carrier-based aircraft continued to attack, with giant-type and Curtiss-type fighters and bombers circling continuously above the Japanese army's positions, repeatedly conducting dive bombings or strafing with machine guns, performing their customary landing warfare tactics. At this time, flames from the enemy aircraft bombings could be seen filling the sky. Japanese special attack units penetrated the center of the enemy mobile forces, encountering intense enemy anti-aircraft fire. More than seventy enemy ships of all sizes simultaneously began firing, instantly filling the sky and hills on the shore with smoke. Japanese aircraft maneuvered actively in the smoke, while enemy vessels fled in disarray on the sea. Before long, a large flame erupted from the sea, which was clear evidence that Japanese aircraft had sunk an enemy ship. Thus, the decisive battle for Luzon Island has begun. After nightfall, the enemy showed no further movements, and the gulf was somewhat calm. However, signal flares were still seen in various locations. The enemy only moved along the coast, firing from their ships, but did not attempt to land, perhaps fearing the Japanese defenses. The Japanese army is awaiting the approach of enemy landing craft at any moment, and is currently standing by.

Japanese Defense Array: Solid as Iron

A certain base on the Philippine Front, 8th (Central News Agency) – Approximately seventy or eighty large landing craft, protected by more than ten special aircraft carriers, belonging to the enemy invaded Lingayen Gulf from the morning of the 6th. From around 11:00 AM, they began to bombard the coast with naval artillery, focusing on the San Fernando area on the northeast coast of the gulf, indicating the enemy's intent to land. On the 5th, the Japanese air force in the area had continued fierce bombing with the Special Attack Unit, the Makoto Unit, causing most of the ships in the gulf to catch fire. The results of the Japanese side's battles have been announced by the Imperial Headquarters, but this only covers until the evening of the 6th, and unconfirmed battle results within the gulf have not yet been announced. The enemy's attempt to land on Luzon Island is now quite evident. Following their operation in Leyte, the enemy landed on Mindoro Island. Subsequently, a powerful mobile force, with the 38th Mobile Force as its main component, launched air raids on Taiwan and Okinawa to disrupt Japanese supply lines. Furthermore, a British fleet in the Indian Ocean attacked northern Sumatra to constrain the Philippine operation. The enemy's desire to invade Luzon Island has grown increasingly urgent since the beginning of the new year. After a fleet of enemy ships appeared in Lingayen Gulf, two subsequent convoys were discovered advancing from south of Mindoro Island and west of Mindanao Island. This indicates that the enemy is indeed making a concerted effort to carry out the landing operation on Luzon Island. Based on the composition of the enemy ships that have now invaded Lingayen Gulf, their troop strength is estimated to be around a division. Moreover, among the subsequent convoys, the convoy sailing south of Mindoro Island has approximately one hundred and fifty large and small transport ships, which appears to be a considerable force, while the enemy convoy advancing west of Mindanao Island is slightly weaker. The Japanese air force bravely launched sorties. On the afternoon of the 6th, they heavily bombed the enemy mobile forces west of Mindoro, confirming the damaging of three aircraft carriers. These aircraft carriers initially listed, and were likely all sunk. Furthermore, the Kongo Unit of the Kamikaze Special Attack Force attacked approximately twenty-five transport ships, escorted by battleships or large cruisers, destroyers, and escorts, south of Rio at 7:00 PM on the 6th. Japanese aircraft immediately used dive-bombing tactics, sinking one medium-sized transport ship and hitting one large cruiser. The Japanese military has long recognized that the enemy's greatest objective in the Philippine operation is to control Luzon Island. Therefore, local defenses are as solid as iron. The Japanese troops waiting here will, as soon as a good opportunity arises – that is, when the enemy makes contact with Luzon Island – launch a fierce counterattack, inflicting significant losses on the enemy forces.

A Philippine Base, 7th (Central News Agency) – Since the 3rd, the Japanese air force has been heavily bombing enemy mobile forces and transport convoys invading the Sulu Sea. Around 5:00 PM on the 5th, the Makoto Air Corps of the Japanese special attack units and various elite forces launched a combined attack on the enemy mobile forces over Luzon Island, which was announced by the Japanese Imperial Headquarters on the 6th. It was reported that three Makoto Unit aircraft crashed valiantly into enemy ships, sinking two enemy aircraft carriers. The Japanese army continues to deploy and is expanding the results of the battle. The following is a record of the damage inflicted on the enemy by the Japanese army and navy air forces in the Philippines over the past three days: enemy aircraft carriers sunk: 2; battleships: 1; battleships or cruisers: 2; cruisers: 1; transport ships: 15; destroyers damaged: 1; transport ships: 2; large ships: 1.

A Philippine Base, 8th (Central News Agency) – On the morning of the 7th, the Japanese air force discovered a small enemy fleet sailing off Mindoro and carried out low-altitude bombing, destroying several of them. Also, at dawn on the same day, they attacked enemy boat groups off San Fernando on Luzon Island, destroying several of them as well.

### Imperial Japanese Army Parade Solemnly Held Yesterday; Army Minister Sugiyama Issues Special Statement

Tokyo, 8th (Central News Agency) – The Imperial Japanese Army's first parade of this year was solemnly held at the Nijubashi Bridge in front of the Imperial Palace on the morning of the 8th (Day of Carrying the Great Imperial Edict), with His Majesty the Emperor present. A parade was also held here eight years ago.

Tokyo, 8th (Central News Agency) – After the parade, Army Minister Sugiyama issued a statement, the gist of which is as follows: The war situation is becoming increasingly critical, and the fate of the Empire hangs in the balance. His Majesty the Emperor held an army parade today and personally inspected the army's military strength. Even though the enemy, Britain and America, have suffered significant blows, they continue to attack with stubborn intent. Although the future of the war situation is extremely critical, as long as the entire army ignites the belief in certain victory and bravely launches attacks, we are certain that victory will be ours. The entire army, united like iron, will work seamlessly with the navy. Regardless of the front or the rear, all officers and soldiers will act with a special attack spirit, vowing to destroy the enemy and put the Emperor's mind at ease.

### Manchukuo Anti-Aircraft Unit Receives Another Citation

Manchuria, 8th (Central News Agency) – In December 1944, when enemy aircraft attacked Fengtian twice, the Manchukuo army cooperated with the Japanese air force to intercept the enemy aircraft, shooting down several and achieving great meritorious service. The commander of the Manchukuo army's anti-aircraft artillery unit and the unit itself received citations from the commander of the Kwantung Defense Army. This time, Xing Shilian of the Military Affairs Department presented another citation, further boosting the morale of all officers and soldiers of the anti-aircraft artillery unit.

### US and French Representatives in Chongqing to Present Credentials on Schedule

Lisbon, 8th (Central News Agency) – According to the German News Agency, citing sources in Chongqing: US Ambassador to Chongqing, Hurley, is scheduled to present his credentials at 11:00 AM on Monday. Mr. Hurley assumed his post as Ambassador to Chongqing in early December last year. According to reports from Stockholm, General Bécoff, the representative of de Gaulle in Chongqing, is scheduled to present his credentials on September 9th.

### Fierce Fighting Around Budapest; Széchenyi Chain Bridge Destroyed

Berlin, 8th (Central News Agency) – Havas News Agency reports: Intense fighting in Budapest has been ongoing for two weeks. The inner city is still far within the outer defense lines of the German-Hungarian forces. Important buildings such as the Parliament and the University are all within the inner city, far from the war zone. However, shells from Soviet long-range artillery and bombs from Soviet aircraft can still reach them. The fighting west of Budapest is approximately several kilometers from Castle Hill. The northern front is in the outskirts of Újpest. Rakoscsaba and Kispest in the east are also centers of intense fighting. The Kislak district in the south remains in the hands of the German-Hungarian forces. Southwest of the city, Soviet forces near Csepel Island have reached the west bank of the Danube. The railway bridge north of Csepel Island has been destroyed. Yesterday, the German-Hungarian forces continued to repel fierce Soviet attacks in the eastern suburbs, only voluntarily abandoning a large building destroyed by Soviet aircraft. The focus of the fighting west of Budapest is between the hills of Vértes and the Gran River, north of Székesfehérvár. The German forces are working hard to prevent the Soviet forces from advancing towards Komárom. There has been no Soviet activity downstream of the Gran River. In the Komárom area, the German forces launched an offensive north of Dobolya to improve their lines.

### German Forces Establish Missile Bases in Northern Italy

Zurich, 8th (Central News Agency) – According to front-line reports: German forces are constructing V-1 and V-2 launch sites throughout northern Italy. This move not only strengthens the defense of the Po Valley but also focuses on preventing Soviet forces from breaking through Austria and covering new offensives in Croatia.

### German Forces Counterattack on the Western Front, Seizing the Initiative; Advance Units Reach Wissembourg on the Southern Flank

Berlin, 8th (Central News Agency) – Havas News Agency reports: Fierce fighting continues on the Western Front in temperatures ranging from -10 to -15 degrees Celsius. The center of the fighting is in areas such as Marche-en-Famenne, Stavelot, and Bastogne in Belgium, as well as northern Alsace. The German forces have continued to make progress around Saargemünd and Bitche. Like the American forces in Belgium, the American forces in Alsace have committed all their troops to the fighting. The British and American forces, led by General Montgomery, launched a fierce attack on the German forces with hundreds of tanks between the Moselle and Meuse rivers, but made no progress. The German forces, equipped for winter warfare, are putting up strong resistance. The German forces continue to threaten Bastogne, and the US Third Army has been forced to retreat to the high ground northeast of the city. Currently, the Allied forces have not established contact, while the German forces, after consolidating their flanks, are moving freely. The German forces have achieved their goal of seizing the initiative.

Berlin, 8th (Central News Agency) – The German counteroffensive in northern Alsace has now taken definite shape. According to reports from the German front lines, the German forces have broken through the US Seventh Army's positions south of Bitche, penetrating 20 kilometers deep. It now appears that the German vanguard has reached a point ten kilometers south of Wissembourg. The US Seventh Army deployed three divisions from central Alsace to halt the German offensive. However, the German forces also advanced from near Finstingen, between Strasbourg and Hagenau, towards the west bank of the Rhine, resulting in the US Seventh Army's right flank defense becoming unfavorable. As a result, the left flank between Saargemünd and Saaralben is also forced to retreat.

Lisbon, 8th (Central News Agency) – According to Reuters correspondents: German forces have crossed the Rhine River near Strasbourg, advancing approximately 2.5 kilometers westward and occupying five villages. According to a Reuters dispatch from Paris, German forces on the Saar front have completely occupied Wingen (34 kilometers west of Hagenau).

### British Stance on the Lublin Government

Stockholm, 8th (Central News Agency) – According to reports from Moscow: Following the Soviet government's recognition of the Lublin Polish Provisional Government, it appointed Morevski as its ambassador to the Soviet Union on the 7th.

### Location of the Three-Power Conference Remains Secret

Stockholm, 8th (Central News Agency) – Havas News Agency reports: The location of the next meeting between Roosevelt, Churchill, and Stalin remains a secret. A diplomatic correspondent for the London Times stated that the selected meeting location will not be in the capital of any of the three countries. The most difficult issue on the agenda will be the Polish dispute. The Soviet Union's recognition of the Lublin Provisional Government has made this dispute even more difficult to resolve. The Soviet government does not seem inclined to change its attitude towards the Dumbarton Oaks plan. As for economic issues, the future of Iranian oil fields will be the most important. Furthermore, at the beginning of the next Three-Power Conference, a decision will be made as to whether General de Gaulle will be the fourth participant.

### Director Matsudaira Exposes Enemy American Conspiracy; Increasing Oppression of Neutral Nations Becomes More Obvious

As usual, the Shanghai Office of the Allied Japanese Embassy held a regular press conference yesterday afternoon. Director Matsudaira of the Information Department and Deputy Consul Fukuma were both in attendance. During the session, Director Matsudaira reported on the American seizure of Chongqing's air network and control of its finances, as well as the increasingly intense American pressure on neutral nations. A record of his speech is as follows:

The American pressure on various countries is becoming more and more overt day by day. Last year, at the request of Chongqing and Chiang, Stillwell was recalled, temporarily seeming to ease tensions on the surface. However, after November of last year, the United States used indirect methods of attack, using newspapers to criticize Chongqing's internal affairs. Simultaneously, through diplomatic means, they seized control of Chongqing's aviation and finances. At the aviation conference held in Chicago last November, Britain and the United States agreed that Chongqing's air network would fall within the American sphere of influence. Due to the decisions of last year's financial conference, the American government assisted Chongqing with its financial problems, gradually seizing control of Chongqing's finances. In Europe, American pressure on various neutral nations has become increasingly intense. Spain is under extreme pressure from the United States, with its trade with Germany being restricted by the United States. Spain's foreign policy is also forced to change. Portugal is similarly pressured by the United States. Recently, Turkey, under pressure from the United States, severed diplomatic relations with Japan. According to the Turkish government's statement, the severance of diplomatic relations with Japan was clearly based on American demands. Turkey has always striven to maintain neutrality, and we deeply regret that it has severed relations with Japan under American pressure. This also illustrates the intensity of American pressure. In view of this, the United States is doing everything in its power to put pressure on the neutral nations of the world, with the aim of changing their policies. These neutral nations are gradually becoming American dependencies. The nations that are opposing America's ambitions head on and trying with all their might to crush them are Japan, Germany, and Mussolini's Italy, all of whom are jointly opposing America's ambitions. Recently, active warfare has been waged in the Pacific and in Europe, inflicting significant losses on America and preventing Roosevelt's desires from being realized. Another country that opposes America is the Soviet Union, which opposes America's monopoly of aviation networks and other attempts at monopoly. In the future, as the war situation intensifies, American pressure on various countries will also intensify, and its attempts to monopolize will become more active. However, we believe that the forces preventing American ambitions will also rise, and the forces crushing America will also grow stronger.

### US Commander Denies Transfer of Air Force Stationed in Chongqing

Stockholm, 8th (Central News Agency) – According to the German News Agency, citing London radio broadcasts, Major General Chennault denied claims that the US 14th Air Force is about to be transferred away from Chongqing.

### Do Not Be Utilized by Britain and America: Chongqing Should Have National Self-Awareness: Broadcast Speech by Songdao, Head of the Reporting Department

Colonel Songdao, head of the reporting department of the Japanese fleet stationed in China, on the occasion of the second anniversary of China's participation in the war, broadcast a speech to the people in the Chongqing resistance area and the peace area, simultaneously from the international and Shanghai radio stations at 9:30 PM on the 7th, entitled "New Year's Message for the Fourth Year of the Greater East Asia War." The broadcast was also broadcast exclusively to Japanese residents by the Greater East Asia Radio Station. The content of the broadcast is as follows:

Japanese Army's Impregnable Defenses

"At the dawn of the fourth year of the Greater East Asia War, I am delighted to be able to speak to you all. First, on this anniversary of China's participation in the war, I extend my gratitude to the officials and people of China for their cooperation in life and death. The war in the Pacific is currently centered on the Philippines and is entering its most intense stage. The American forces are extremely anxious and are attempting to break through the Japanese lines in the Philippines at all costs. However, against the Japanese army's impregnable defenses, they are merely wasting their forces.

American Losses in Philippine Sea and Air

Since the first Philippine sea and air battle in October of last year, two and a half months have passed. Up to January 6th, the enemy's losses have been calculated as follows: 30 aircraft carriers sunk, 5 battleships, 3 battleships or cruisers, 21 cruisers, 6 cruisers or destroyers, 15 destroyers, 1 unidentified type of warship, more than 107 transport ships, 21 torpedo boats, more than 20 landing craft, and 2 others, totaling more than 231 vessels. Furthermore, 29 aircraft carriers, 10 battleships, 22 cruisers, 3 cruisers or destroyers, 7 destroyers, 29 unidentified types of warships, 48 transport ships, 6 torpedo boats, and many landing craft were damaged, totaling more than 154 vessels. The combined total of sunk and damaged vessels reaches more than 385. Additionally, 1,965 aircraft were shot down or destroyed, and personnel losses are estimated at approximately tens of thousands. However, as a result, from the overall perspective of the Philippines, even the small island of Leyte, which has no great strategic value, has not been captured. Although Mindoro Island, the stepping stone to invading Manila, has been landed upon, it is under concentrated attack by Japanese air forces, making further progress extremely difficult. During this time, the enemy dispatched a portion of its mobile forces to the sea east of Taiwan and again launched air raids on Taiwan and the Ryukyu Islands, attempting to cut off Japan's supply lines to the Philippines. Another portion of its mobile forces was transferred to the sea west of Luzon Island, and since January 13th, it has suffered significant damage, including three aircraft carriers sunk and three damaged. In addition, 32 various types of vessels were sunk or damaged.

Blind Bombing Without Regard for Consequences

The enemy's current intention seems to be to urgently conquer Luzon Island, taking the first step in the new year through fierce battles between the two armies. At the same time, on the mainland front, due to the efforts of the Japanese army and the cooperation of the navy, important strategic points are being gradually occupied, crushing the American army's future use of the mainland as a base, serving as the first step in Japan's decisive battle. After the Japanese army obtained a majority of air bases, the activities of the American air force stationed in Chongqing were greatly hampered. During this period, the only effective tactic the American army relied on was to use large bombers to attack Japanese production areas, in order to weaken its production capacity. Furthermore, the fact that American bombing extends to the Chinese people is understood by the generals in Chongqing. Especially the ominous atmosphere after the bombing of Hankou on December 10th of last year is intolerable to the people of the Greater East Asia region. This kind of behavior is completely contrary to the American national policy of advocating world peace. The editorial of the Da Chu Newspaper, led by Hu Lancheng, stated that this American air raid is truly hostile to humanity, bombing without selecting targets, and waging war without selecting means, prioritizing utilitarian victory.

Manifestation of the Bushido Spirit

Throughout history, Japan's wars have all been manifestations of the Bushido spirit. In the past, many battles were fought due to a shortage of food for both countries. However, this time, the air raids specialize in blindly bombing the Chinese people who seek overall peace, which is completely contrary to Mr. Chiang's recent statement that the people in the peace area are also compatriots. The people in the Wuhan area regard American aircraft as demons, and Chongqing can be said to be a traitor to East Asia and a public enemy of the Chinese people. Regarding Americans as pests of humanity is what I am most saddened about for Chongqing.

The American army's invasion of East Asia will cause the people of East Asia to forever groan in misery. As the facts stated above, for the Chinese and Japanese nations, are merely a prelude. However, judging from the situation, the decisive battle between Japan and the United States is gradually shifting westward, which is by no means a welcome thing for China. Recalling the current situation in Italy and France in Europe, as well as the recent tragic situation in Changsha on the mainland, one can imagine that the American army's indiscriminate destructive means during the future decisive battle will coincide with their Anglo-Saxon firstism, which aims to exterminate the East Asian people. Recent broadcasts from Chongqing and Yan'an further confirm my belief. But my belief, representing the Greater East Asia youth ideal of young Japan, has never regarded the people in Chongqing and Yan'an as enemies.

Improve China's Future Destiny

Today, I am friends with many Chinese friends in Shanghai. I often tell my friends the necessity of overall peace. We should spare no effort to prevent Britain and America from invading China. Recently, a certain Chinese youth who had studied in Japan said to me, "I hope to do my best for Japan." At that time, I replied, "No, I hope you will build Greater East Asia for China." Furthermore, the American counterattack has suffered so much consumption that it will cause serious social problems that threaten the lives of Americans in the future. In this state, if the war continues for one day, America will inevitably make the Chinese people sacrifice more in order to make up for the loss of manpower, which is what I am trying my best to oppose. On New Year's Day this year, I listened to Mr. Chiang's broadcast, which clearly indicated that military affairs are the priority. However, to concentrate China's manpower and material resources on the war for this purpose, wanting to use the Chinese people to fight, I feel that if this great manpower and material resources are used for construction instead of destroying China, how profound the happiness of the people will be. If China's land is transformed into a decisive battlefield, then this manpower and material resources will be consumed to destroy China. Judging from the recent tragedy in Changsha, recovery will take at least 100 years. We will spare no effort to prevent tragedies. In short, I believe that we should think from the overall perspective to improve China's future destiny.

Kamikaze Spirit Overcomes Difficulties

At the same time, the recent change in the situation in Europe due to the German army's Rundstedt offensive has brought unexpected results to Britain and America. This shows that the British and American propaganda predicting the rapid collapse of Germany is a misunderstanding, and it also shows that America's material strength is not invincible. We are fully aware that Germany is currently in an extremely difficult situation, but as stated in the declarations of Hitler and Propaganda Minister Goebbels, Germany has the greatness to overcome difficulties. We firmly believe that Germany can change from defense to offense, and the world situation is expected to undergo amazing changes. Regardless of the situation around them, the Japanese people will advance forward with the spirit of the Kamikaze attack隊 to accomplish the nation's mission and overcome all difficulties. I believe that Mr. Chiang Kai-shek, He Yingqin, and others are aware of this. Here, I pray that the officials and people of Chongqing will have true national self-awareness for the destiny of China."

### Air Defense Day Implemented Today: Local General Training: First Time Held at the Huangpu Sub-Bureau

Today (the 9th) is the 13th Air Defense Day. The Municipal Civil Air Defense Headquarters, as usual, will expand publicity on the significance of air defense and conduct various air defense training exercises. The alarm training issuance time has been detailed in yesterday's newspaper. However, sirens will not be sounded. Citizens should take various air defense measures within the specified time. If an alarm sounds, it is a real alarm, and citizens should pay attention to it. It has been found that the management of street "air defense lights" has not been adequate in the past. Lights should be turned on when a warning alarm is issued and dimmed when an air raid alarm is issued. This should be done through a responsibility system, assigning responsibility to one person to avoid errors. The same method should be used when issuing and canceling training alarms.

Implementation of Local General Training

Air defense training has been implemented twelve times so far, lasting for a year. However, there are still places where things are done perfunctorily. In order to improve this, a designated area under the jurisdiction of each sub-bureau will be specified for local general training on each training day, making general arrangements for air defense. The first training is being held in the Huangpu Sub-Bureau today. At that time, due to the imagined blind bombing by a large enemy aircraft squadron, bombing or shelling was assumed to have occurred in various parts of the jurisdiction. The simulated enemy aircraft continued to attack repeatedly to disrupt air defense work. Each sub-bureau chief and chief of police defense should inspect the situation of this exercise in the Huangpu Sub-Bureau jurisdiction for reference. The Air Defense Headquarters should send inspectors to assess the following items: (1) Status of equipment and materials preparation; (2) Appropriateness of the training plan; (3) Appropriateness of command; (4) Appropriateness of situation performance; (5) Status of mobilization; (6) Appearance, morale, and actions; (7) Thoroughness of evacuation; (8) General evaluation of training; (9) Status of citizen cooperation; (10) Others. The local general training for other sub-bureaus has also been separately specified, including: Round 2: Taishan, Lujiawan, Changshu; Round 3: Laozha, Xincheng; Round 4: Huashan, Changning, Xujiahui; Round 5: Jing'an Temple, Jiangning, Putuo Road; Round 6: Hongkou, West Hongkou, North Sichuan Road, Zhabei; Round 7: Yangshupu, Tijianqiao, Yulin Road, Xinshijie; Round 8: Yimiao, Penglai Road, Xiejiao. When each sub-bureau conducts general training, it should invite all residents in the entire area to participate. To facilitate general transportation, except for one or two main lines, which will be open on time, all other lines will be blocked, and the designated detour routes will be announced at the blockade points. At the same time, other sub-bureaus that are not conducting the aforementioned local general training should increase the number of training locations and expand their scope, and conduct small-unit drills as much as possible (generally using "bao" 保 as the unit). In addition to training actions, the mobilization time should also be recorded, and special attention should be paid to improving the level of training. At the same time, all residents in the training area should be guided to participate in the general air defense training so that no one will remain a bystander in the future.

Swift and Prepared Communication

During the second training alarm at 2:00 PM and 3:00 PM today, it is assumed that all communication agencies have been interrupted. Upon receiving the alarm from the Army and Navy Air Defense Headquarters at that time, a communication training exercise will be carried out immediately, communicating to all sub-bureaus under its jurisdiction, relevant agencies, and organizations. Therefore, in addition to dispatching liaison personnel in accordance with the Special Police Order No. 8, each sub-bureau should determine a liaison team structure capable of communicating alarms to all parts of its jurisdiction and immediately mobilize in accordance with the instructions of the Air Defense Headquarters to conduct the fastest and most accurate communication drills in various areas. Each sub-bureau should report its organizational structure, the status of completed communication work in various areas, and record the time after implementation. When implementing this exercise, the Huangpu Sub-Bureau should select ten appropriate liaison personnel from among its police officers or "bao-jia" 保甲 personnel in the district, bring bicycles, and go to the Air Defense Headquarters to receive the command of the chief of the Air Defense Section one hour before the implementation, which is at 1:00 PM and 2:00 PM for two rounds, sending five people each time. This training is based on item 2 mentioned above, without sounding the alarm siren. Therefore, for various alarm issuance and cancellation times other than the aforementioned alarm communication exercise, it is necessary to establish a rapid and reliable approach to ensure that the entire jurisdiction is thoroughly informed. This type of alarm communication is an important exercise, and its purpose is to anticipate situations where the alarm siren is damaged or does not sound. It is important to remember that it has significant practical applications and should be practiced and trained. In addition, rescue and firefighting training should also be conducted meticulously and seriously.

### Shanghai Branch of the New Association Holds War Participation Speech: Deputy President Chen Riping Gives the Speech

Today is the second anniversary of the National Government's entry into the war. At this decisive stage, it is even more important to arouse the nation's soaring fighting spirit, devote all efforts to cooperate in the war, and strive for the final victory. In view of this, the Shanghai Branch of the China News Association has scheduled a speech to celebrate the second anniversary of the National Government's entry into the war at the Grand Guangming Theater at 5:00 PM this afternoon. Mr. Chen Riping, deputy president of the Xinwen Bao, has been invited to give the speech. After the speech, war films and Huaying's famous film "Hero and Beauty" will be shown.

### Education Bureau Sets Fee Standards for Schools

The Municipal Education Bureau previously received an order from the Municipal Government to approve the Ministry of Education's request to set fee standards for public and private primary and secondary schools for the next semester. A draft plan was drawn up in early December of last year and reported to the Municipal Government and the Ministry of Education. It is now known that the public and private primary and secondary school fee standards have been approved and implemented. The interim standards for the treatment of teachers and staff and the collection of student fees in private primary and secondary schools are excerpted below: (1) Private primary and secondary schools, kindergartens, and equivalent schools (hereinafter referred to as "schools") in this city should pay the salaries of teachers and staff and collect student fees in accordance with these standards from the second semester of the 33rd academic year (i.e., from February 1945). (2) The salaries paid to teachers and staff and the student fees collected by schools should be calculated in terms of Central Reserve Bank notes. (3) The salaries paid to full-time teachers and staff by schools, if calculated on a monthly basis, should be calculated on the basis of six full months per semester. (4) The salaries paid to teachers and staff by schools should not be less than 70% of the total tuition revenue, excluding rent, and should be paid monthly without delay. (5) The amount of student fees collected by schools each semester should be determined based on the fee collection situation of the previous semester and the economic conditions of the majority of student families, but the maximum should not exceed the provisions of these standards (a list of regulations is below). (6) Schools that provide boarding and meals for students should organize a meal committee to be responsible for handling the meals. (7) Schools may charge boarding and meal fees for boarding and meal students based on actual circumstances. (8) Private middle schools that have experimental or practical subjects may charge appropriate fees based on actual needs. (9) Private kindergartens and kindergartens attached to private primary schools may charge a snack fee, the amount of which depends on the quality of the snacks provided.

(11) All living allowance fees for teachers and staff previously collected by private schools from students will be discontinued. (12) In addition to the various fees collected by schools being handled in accordance with the various articles listed in these standards, no other similar items may be established to force or solicit contributions from students. (13) Schools should establish free tuition quotas in accordance with the Ministry of Education's orders for students from poor families and children of service personnel in the education and culture sectors or civil servants below the rank of commissioner. The number of free tuition places in secondary schools should not be less than 15% of the total number of students, and the number of free tuition places in primary schools should not be less than 20% of the total number of students. (14) The categories and amounts of student fees (referring to the amount of fees planned to be collected per student) that each school plans to collect for each grade in each semester should be reported to the Bureau for record before the start of school. The names, grades, and number of free students, as well as the distribution of fees, should be registered and reported to the Bureau before the end of the third month of each semester for submission to the Ministry of Education for review. (15) If schools have special circumstances where the tuition and fees collected must exceed the provisions of these standards, the schools must first submit a detailed statement of the facts and circumstances to the Bureau for approval before they can increase the fees. (16) In accordance with the regulations of the Ministry of Education on primary and secondary schools, each school should have the principal inform full-time teachers each semester and publicly elect three to five people to form a financial audit committee. The committee members will take turns serving as chairman and will be responsible for auditing the income and expenditure accounts. Meetings should be held once a month, and the list of committee members should be submitted to the Bureau for record within one month after the start of school. (17) If the price level in the city changes excessively, these interim standards may be submitted for amendment. (18) These interim standards will be implemented from the date of approval by the Municipal Government and the Ministry of Education. (Highest Standard List of Student Fees Charged by Private Primary and Secondary Schools in Shanghai Special Municipality): Middle School: Senior high school tuition: 7,500 yuan, Art fee: 100 yuan, Physical education fee: 50 yuan. Junior high school tuition: 6,000 yuan, Art and physical education fees are the same as senior high school.

### Economic Security Office Holds Food Rice Symposium, Director Goshima Attends and Delivers Speech

Since the sharp rise in rice prices at the end of last year, it has stimulated soaring prices of all goods, and the lives of citizens have been seriously threatened, especially the general salaried class. In addition to actively studying countermeasures, the city government's economic authorities, and the Economic Security Office of the Police Bureau, have paid close attention to this. It is reported that in order to convey the city government's determination to suppress prices and to discuss thorough measures to investigate rice hoarding, the office specially convened a rice symposium at 2:00 PM yesterday (the 8th) at the Police Club on Fourth Road. More than 30 people attended, including the commander of the Security Police Corps, the district chiefs of Jiangwan, Zhoujiaqiao, Beixinjing, Xujiahui, Hongqiao, Zhenru, Dachang, Nanxiang, and Qinghe, as well as the relevant police station chiefs. Director Goshima and Section Chief Fukuda personally presided over the meeting. Director Goshima delivered a speech, stating, "Rice is not only the focus of citizens' lives, but also the standard for prices of all goods. Recently, due to the sharp rise in rice prices, the prices of all goods have soared, and the threat to citizens' lives can be said to have reached the most serious stage. There are many reasons for the sharp rise in rice prices, but the collusion between some illegal military police and unscrupulous merchants is a major reason for the recent surge in rice prices. For example, extortion along the way increases the cost for rice merchants, or they stop and do not move forward, creating difficulties in transportation, which is one example. The Economic Security Office has a heavy responsibility for the implementation of wartime controlled economy. In the future, I hope that all police station chiefs, security team leaders, and township chiefs will truly understand the difficulties of the times, inspire their conscience, and embrace the concept that they are a member of the nation and a member of the citizens. The high prices in Shanghai, especially the sharp rise in rice prices, affect everyone, and everyone has a responsibility. We must unite officials and people to work together to seek a fall in rice prices and stability in life. If illegal police officers and unscrupulous merchants are still found to be colluding to manipulate rice and affect prices in the future, this office will impose the most severe sanctions in accordance with the Wartime Economic Special Criminal Law." Then, Fukuda, the section chief of the Second Section of the Economic Security Office, delivered a speech, stating the determination to suppress rice prices and the specific methods in detail. After that, the township chiefs expressed their opinions, and they discussed for a long time whether or not markets should be set up in various districts and towns, until the meeting adjourned at around 5:00 PM.

### Reader's Aid to Education News, "Sending Charcoal in the Snow" Becomes a Praised Story

Silver Wedding Anniversary Gift Aids Education

Yesterday, it was raining and foggy, with cold air and muddy roads, making it difficult for pedestrians to walk. Mr. Jinian Yi personally came to the newspaper office and generously donated more than 210,000 yuan to form a "Silver Wedding Anniversary Team." Mr. Ji is honest and sincere, and kind-hearted. Sending charcoal in the snow is exactly the beautiful act that the ancients referred to. Comparing the past with the present, it seems similar. It is said that this time, the "Silver Wedding" anniversary gifts from relatives and friends totaled more than 400,000 yuan, not including gifts. From this, it can be seen that he has a wide range of social interactions and a strong friendship. He himself did not move a penny of this money, but transferred it to help the Shen Bao and Xin Bao loan scholarships, making a generous donation and showing admirable enthusiasm. The beneficiaries are of course grateful to tears. In these end times, people's hearts are not as ancient, and once they become rich, family turmoil is bound to occur, abandoning the old and welcoming the new is regarded as commonplace. Mr. Ji strives to move upward, and the couple has a deep affection, which becomes even stronger in old age, with a "I am sober while everyone is drunk" mentality, which is also worthy of admiration.

Silver Wedding Anniversary Gift Aids Education

A letter from relatives and friends of Mr. Jinian Yi says: "Dear Sir, on January 1st, we happily celebrated the silver wedding of Mr. Jinian Yi and Ms. Peiying. We and others presented money as a gift to show our friendship. Mr. Ji, sympathizing with the difficulties of the times, repeatedly declined, but the anniversary gifts given by relatives and friends were sent one after another, making it impossible to refuse. We now wish to donate this sum of money, totaling 430,400 yuan, to the scholarship fund, with the Shen Bao and Xin Bao each accounting for half, named the 'Silver Wedding Anniversary Team,' to create blessings for all relatives and friends. We are sending the list of names, hoping that you will publish it as a blessing."

Benefit Performance Tickets Sold Separately

Since students from various universities launched a benefit performance of "Wealthy Life" in response to this newspaper's scholarship fund, they have been actively promoting it.

Ordinary tickets are divided into three types: 2,000 yuan, 1,000 yuan, and 500 yuan, and the names will not be published separately. It is hoped that students from major secondary schools and enthusiastic people from the society will assist in the process. We are extremely grateful. Yesterday, students from Fudan University took the lead in handing over more than 50,000 yuan in honorary ticket funds. The titles of the sponsors are announced as follows:

### Chen Lianbo Dies in Hong Kong

Mr. Chen Lianbo, former Chairman of the Guangzhou General Chamber of Commerce, Head of the Merchant Corps, Chinese Manager of HSBC, Hong Kong tycoon, and Chief Representative of the Hong Kong Chinese People's Representative Conference, died in Hong Kong on the 24th of last month. Mr. He Zhuoxian, General Manager of the Agricultural and Commercial Bank, a close friend of Mr. Chen in this city, received a telegram from Mr. Chen's family yesterday, and immediately reported it to Acting Chairman Chen, and telegraphed back to Mr. Chen's family.

### Bank Stops Payment of Negotiable Instruments, Handled in Accordance with Industry Regulations

In recent years, the number of banks in Shanghai has gradually increased to more than two hundred, and their business conditions vary. It is difficult to maintain consistent progress. There are many banks that operate prudently, but a few banks also have uneven practices, and from time to time, banks stop payment on the negotiable instruments they issued this year. In view of this, the Joint Reserve of the Bank Association has specifically suggested that each bank handle the payment of stopped negotiable instruments and send the stopped amount to the association for safekeeping to show credibility. At the same time, in order to strictly implement it, the Bank Association recently notified all member banks to follow suit. According to the provisions of Article 24 of the banking industry regulations, "When a bank-issued draft, promissory note, or check, or an accepted draft, is lost, destroyed, or obtained by someone through illegal means, the issuer should prepare an application form, state the reasons to the bank, report the loss and stop payment, and the bank may order it to be published in two or more designated daily newspapers for three days each to declare it invalid. At the same time, the issuer and a guarantor recognized by the bank should carefully prepare a letter of guarantee. After two months, if there are no disputes, the payment will be made."

### Turning Point in Postal Workers' Strike

In order to demand higher treatment to maintain the minimum wartime living conditions, the postal workers of this city formed a go-slow state of all employees starting from the day before yesterday. It is reported that after Wen Lanting and others took office as mediators, there has been a turning point in the situation. Their original telegram to the Minister of Construction is as follows: "Fu Minister of the Nanjing Construction Department: The strike of Shanghai postal workers is expanding, and the impact on the city's commercial finance is not small. We and others could not bear to stand idly by, and worked hard to mediate. In view of the temporary relief and postal rate increase, we are particularly responsible for asking the authorities to adopt it. On the one hand, we advised them to resume work immediately and guaranteed it with our personal credibility. We have already expressed our acceptance, and there has been a turning point. We specially telegraph the ministry to ask you to consider the difficult situation of the employees and quickly approve it so as to maintain credibility and manage the group. We are extremely eager to await orders. Wen Lanting, Yuan Ludeng, and Lin Kanghou kowtow together."

Next Sunday, January 21st, there will be a grand boxing championship final in this city, held at the Jai Alai Stadium on Xianyang Road. The athletes participating will have players from China, Japan, Germany, Poland, and Russia. The final battle for the championship will be between Iwamoto, the Japanese welterweight champion, and Tandi, the Polish veteran who has won hundreds of battles. The title of the All-China Welterweight Champion will be decided by this battle. It is still remembered that Fukuda, the invincible Japanese boxing king, came to Shanghai and won repeatedly, but unfortunately, he was defeated by Tandi. Tandi was once frustrated by Iwamoto, so Tandi wants to avenge his previous defeat, and Iwamoto intends to avenge Fukuda. When the two meet, they will definitely fight to the death. The battle between the dragon and the tiger will definitely be a fierce battle. Boxing matches in this city have not been held for eight months. This time, the lineup has been carefully selected and is extremely exciting. Li Peigen, a young and strong Chinese, is brave and promising. He once knocked down a Russian expatriate and will definitely have a better performance. The competition time has been changed to 10:00 AM due to air defense relations, so that the audience can enter. Tickets will go on sale on January 10th.

### Air Defense Day Established in This City, Today's Anniversary, Acting Minister Wu Delivers Speech

Today (the 9th) is the second anniversary of the Republic of China's participation in the Greater East Asia War, and it is also the first anniversary of the establishment of "Air Defense Day". Mr. Wu Songqing, Acting Minister of the Civil Air Defense Headquarters of this city, delivered a speech as follows:

Air Defense Facilities in the Past Year

"Today is the second anniversary of the Republic of China's participation in the Greater East Asia War, and it is also the first anniversary of the establishment of Air Defense Day in this city. During this past period, the Civil Air Defense Headquarters of this city has used the opportunity of holding Air Defense Day every month to remind citizens that they urgently need to prepare themselves to cope with the danger of this city being bombed by enemy aircraft. However, because the necessary materials are not easy to obtain, the various air defense facilities that have been planned have not been put into practice. But in the past year, air defense water storage ponds have been built in various parts of this city, and each Baojia office has been allocated hand-pressed pumps. In addition, there is one air defense training center that has been established. The Civil Air Defense Headquarters is still continuing to work hard to make the air defense equipment of this city even more perfect. Regarding the need for this city to establish appropriate air defense shelters, the public has been informed many times.

War Situation Enters Decisive Stage

The war situation has now entered a decisive stage, and the severity of the situation is increasing day by day. No one can predict when the enemy will carry out large-scale bombing of this city. Reading the newspapers, it can be seen that enemy aircraft are now coming to attack almost every day. Recently, the enemy has indiscriminately bombed some cities in this country, and this city has also suffered this kind of bombing three times, with innocent civilians tragically sacrificed. Based on the experience gained from these bombings and in view of the tragic bombing of Hankou, it is no longer the time to carry out preliminary air defense training. All citizens should have a deep understanding of the current situation. It must be known that enemy aircraft attacks are now possible at any time. If the citizens of this city can be fully prepared, then there is nothing to fear no matter what large-scale bombing the enemy carries out on this city.

Regarding this point, the Civil Air Defense Headquarters deeply knows that it is urgently necessary to equip the citizens of this city with sufficient air defense shelters and is willing to do its best to engage in this effort. On the one hand, it hopes that every citizen, whether at home or in the workplace, will prepare to find a way to hide immediately in the event of an air raid. It must be known that exposure without cover is extremely dangerous. Any simple shelter is better than no shelter at all.

Fully Store Food and Drinking Water

According to the experience of those who have lost their homes due to air raids in other cities, it takes a considerable amount of time to transport food and drinking water to the disaster areas. Therefore, sufficient food and drinking water should be stored at ordinary times for emergency needs.

Recently, the enemy has mostly used incendiary bombs to attack, so large-scale fires should be carefully prevented. When the enemy launches a large-scale attack, it is difficult to predict where they will drop bombs. Surplus clothing and blankets should be moved to a safe location or stored in the homes of relatives and friends elsewhere in the city. In the current stage of the war, everyone needs to be prepared to cope with air raids. Air raids in this city have already begun and will continue to come.

The Civil Air Defense Headquarters deeply hopes that the citizens of this city will pay attention and follow the instructions of the headquarters and various district sub-offices. At the same time, they should work hard to train and make practical preparations, so that even if they are attacked by air, there will be nothing to fear."

Special Issue Commemorating the Second Anniversary of China's Participation in the War

### How to Take on the Responsibility of Participating in the War

— Luo Ding

Today is the second anniversary of the National Government's announcement of participation in the war. Looking back on the speech that the late Chairman Wang gave to the whole country when he participated in the war two years ago: "From today, we have stepped into the war to defend East Asia. Each of us must strive to become a fighter to defend East Asia... Now, how brave are the soldiers and citizens of the friendly country Japan on the front lines... How can we be worthy of being their partners?" The words of the late Chairman Wang are still in my ears. In today's fierce war situation, we must not be afraid of being annoyed and must review the responsibility of participating in the war:

1.  How to Strengthen Increased Production - Last year, it was proposed that it was a year of total mobilization for the increased production movement. It is an unshakable principle that one can only wage war with production. In recent years, the plans for increased production have been listed in detail, doing everything possible; however, in reality, the phenomenon of reduced production occurs at any time. - Lack of supplies, soaring prices. What is expressed in the countryside is the desolation of the fields, the imperfections of various systems, the exploitation and extortion of personnel, and the complexity and embezzlement of taxes... Farmers often let go of their cattle, put down their hoes, and engage in single-handed business; what is manifested in industry is the lack of raw materials, the reduction and cessation of motive power, the improper allocation of materials, and the lack of freedom of transportation... resulting in the abandonment of most factory machinery and sitting idle. To seek increased production is no different from talking in a dream. If this continues, it will be unbearable to imagine. We cannot but shout loudly today: real increased production is needed! However, strengthening increased production has to pay attention to the following points: (1) The control mechanism for allocation and purchase should be improved as soon as possible to suit the feelings of the people; (2) Increased production should include agriculture and industry, echoing each other, and pure agrarianism is not feasible; (3) Suppress corrupt officials, unscrupulous merchants, and local tyrants; ensure public security; (4) Maintain the raw materials and motive power for normal production; (5) Take into account the cost of production, so that the conditions for reproduction are not harsh; (Producers should have more income so that they will not stop operating.) (6) Technical improvement; (7) Rationalize taxes and loans;—eliminate usury. (8) Smooth the exchange of materials between the north and the south; (9) Transportation agencies should not have any particularity; (10) Utilize scattered capital and labor.

2.  Severely Clarify Politics - In fact, the transformation of increased production into reduced production is mostly not because of the unsound political institutions, which makes it impossible to properly implement various wartime controlled economic policies? Forgiving the past, what is needed now is a deep reflection: how to rectify officialdom? How to eliminate corruption? How to unify and simplify power? How to strive to be close to the people? These are all indispensable victory targets under the participation in the war. What must be solemnly proposed again here: some administrative personnel still lack strong beliefs, holding the concept of a five-day magistrate, thinking that: the purpose of being an official is to make money; with the prevalence of this psychology, how can the wind of corruption be eliminated? As a result, the people have no intact skin. This kind of behavior is the most punishable! They are truly the worst pests and thieves of the people! It must be known that "Heaven sees as the people see," right and wrong are still in people's hearts, and the people's hearts are truly the greatest law of cause and effect in the world. According to the most correct historical view, look at the results of not following the people's hearts since ancient times, and there are always the greatest sanctions. Even if it is like this now, it will always be like this in the future! The Hou Hu incident is just one example. "The country has permanent laws, and it will not perish even if it is in danger." I hope that the government will have the determination to use severe punishments in troubled times. Cao Tai said: "We endured ten years of cold to provide warm seats for the people; the court had a face full of tears, hearing the laughter of the world." I wish to reiterate these words.

3.  Eradicate Speculation and Hoarding - Profiteers cannot coexist with the people. The government has already explicitly banned them; however, in recent years, hoarding and manipulating materials to stimulate prices has become more and more rampant. For example, the soaring prices of food and fuel have plunged the people into the abyss of despair. Today, the government must not hesitate any longer and quickly use drastic methods to severely sanction them. The Special Criminal Law for Wartime regarding regulations disrupting the economy was promulgated as early as two years ago. In order to maintain the government's prestige, it must be truly strengthened and implemented immediately! Any criminal behavior of stirring up trouble, speculating, and hoarding will not be easily tolerated because of strong backing. All "big fish" will be punished with the death penalty! Furthermore, a way out should be sought for urban commercial capital as soon as possible, give it rational guidance, and guarantee its safety and profitability. The normal production of coal and electricity must not be saved, and the allied countries must also deeply understand this.

4.  Earnestly Advocate Thrift - Under the wartime system, it is appropriate to increase what should be increased and save what should be saved. It is unnecessary pain to talk about thrift for the salaried class and basic producers who are already serving the public on an empty stomach; it is unnecessary enjoyment for profiteers who indulge in wine pools, meat forests, and extreme luxury without forced thrift. Therefore, in order to be thrifty, one must first start by sanctioning profiteers. Their extravagant lives are all a crazy pathological state at the end of the century, which has a great impact on social economic security. Because there are huge profits to be made, they desperately seek stimulation; because life is abnormal, they have to use a lot of money to make up for it. Cause and effect go on infinitely, but the people suffer! To give an example: the general "big restaurants" search for food and fuel, which suddenly increases the market price. Is this one of the increased production movements of "vermilion gates and wine and meat" under the wartime system? "What does the thickness of customs depend on? It depends on the hearts of one or two people." Indeed, in the past, thrift was a social moral code that relied on the promotion of knowledgeable people, but today, it must be enforced and punished by law. Making it impossible for profiteers to enjoy themselves excessively after exhausting all their efforts is also a supplementary banning method.

### Political Developments in Our Nation During Two Years of War Participation

— Fei Lizhi

The Course of War Participation

One year after the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the late Chairman Wang of the National Government, based on the principle of "sharing life and death," joined hands with Japan and warned the people of the country. In December of the 31st year (of the Republic), the Chairman, in order to further cooperate with Japan and strengthen the National Government, went to Japan to negotiate with the Japanese authorities on issues such as cooperating to complete the war and realizing the construction of the Co-Prosperity Sphere. He returned home on the 27th after completing his mission. On January 9th of the 32nd year of the Republic (1943), the National Government, with the joint signatures of the Chairman and the heads of the five Yuan (branches of government), issued a declaration of war against Britain and the United States, formally participating in the Greater East Asia War. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs simultaneously notified the governments of the Axis powers of this intention. Two hours after the National Government declared war on Britain and the United States, the Chinese and Japanese authorities, in order to declare their comprehensive cooperation in completing the common war against Britain and the United States, specially signed the Sino-Japanese Joint Declaration at 11:00 AM that morning.

Preparation for Wartime System

The Central Political Committee simultaneously resolved to establish the Supreme National Defense Council, which could suspend the effect of existing laws and omit statutory procedures for draft laws before submitting them to the National Government for promulgation. This conference brought together central figures in the political sphere, so that military and political liaison could be tightened and made more organic. At the same time, it was decided that the chairman of the North China Political Affairs Committee must also participate, and when necessary, local military and political leaders could also participate, in order to achieve an organic connection between the central government and local areas. The first National Defense Conference after the war participation decided to reorganize the Executive Yuan first and then seek reform of the local political system in order to strengthen wartime administrative efficiency and achieve administrative simplification: (1) The National Economic Committee and the New People's Movement Promotion Committee, which were under the jurisdiction of the Executive Yuan, were transferred to the direct jurisdiction of the National Government. (2) The Ministry of Personnel under the Examination Yuan was transferred to the Executive Yuan. (3) The Social Movement Guidance Committee and the Relief Committee were merged into the Ministry of Social Welfare. (4) The Food Management Committee was changed to the Ministry of Food. (5) The Water Conservancy Committee and the Ministry of Communications were merged into the Ministry of Construction. (6) The Frontier and Overseas Chinese Affairs Committees were changed to the Frontier Affairs Bureau and the Overseas Chinese Affairs Bureau, each directly under the Ministries of Interior and Foreign Affairs.

On February 8th, the Japanese government issued a statement on the transfer of new enemy property. The Executive Yuan then decided the next day to establish an Enemy Property Management Committee to handle the takeover of enemy property.

In mid-June, the Executive Yuan decided to add a Department of Health to handle national health administration affairs.

In addition, the adjustment of local institutions was gradually implemented after the war participation: at the Second Supreme National Defense Conference, it was decided to improve the organization of provincial governments and change the provincial committee system to a provincial governor system.

At the end of March, the National Government ordered the promulgation of the change of Xiamen City, Fujian Province, to a special municipality; in mid-October, Hankou Special Municipality was changed to an ordinary municipality.

Regarding the re-division of local administrative units: (1) The Central Political Committee passed the establishment of the Jiangxi Provincial Government in early May; at the end of May, the Supreme National Defense Conference approved the abolition of the Suhua Headquarters and the establishment of the Subei Pacification Commissioner's Office. The original counties in northern Jiangsu were returned to the Jiangsu Provincial Government.

In mid-November of the same year, the Central Political Committee decided to reorganize the important institutions of the North China Political Affairs Committee: (1) abolish the two positions of Political Secretary and establish three offices of General Affairs, Internal Affairs, and Finance; (2) the six General Offices of Internal Affairs, Public Security, Education, Finance, Industry, and Construction were reorganized into five General Offices of Public Security, Economy, Agriculture, Education, and Public Works.

Central-Local Tightening

On January 10th of the 32nd year (1943), the Executive Yuan convened a national conference of senior local administrative officials, such as the chairman of the North China Political Affairs Committee, provincial governors, mayors of special municipalities, and commanders of special zone headquarters, to discuss the central and local wartime administrative strategies after the war participation: (1) how to increase production and strengthen public security in wartime economy; (2) how to promote the New People's Movement and implement general mobilization of spirit in wartime public propaganda and training. At the same time, the North China Political Affairs Committee held multiple conferences of provincial and municipal leaders in order to agree on the completion of the North China decisive battle system and various policies such as food prices, and to clarify the government's determination.

North China Centralization

The first Supreme National Defense Conference of the National Government resolved to transfer the organizations of the "New Movement" and "National Economy" committees from the Executive Yuan to the direct jurisdiction of the National Government, and the chairman of the North China Political Affairs Committee also participated as vice chairman. At the same time, the Second Plenary Agreement Conference of the North China New People's Association, convened in mid-January, in addition to issuing a declaration to protect the National Government's war participation policy, also elected the late Chairman Wang as the honorary chairman of the association. Following the abolition of additional markings on the national flag by the National Government, the North China Political Affairs Committee also banned the use of the Five-Colored Flag from February 9th; and in order to establish close contact with the central government, a liaison office was specially established in Nanjing in early July.

Judicial and Administrative Conference

In order to strengthen the national judicial organization, improve the judicial system, maintain public security, and cooperate in completing the war, the Ministry of Justice and Administration specially convened a judicial and administrative conference, which had not been held for eight years, starting on January 11th of the 32nd year (1943), to discuss issues such as the improvement of the procuratorial system and the abolition of county magistrates concurrently administering justice.

Police Administration Conference

After the National Government's war participation, consolidating the rear was an urgent task. In order to understand the actual situation of police administration in various provinces, municipalities, and districts, and to improve the police organization, the Ministry of Interior specially convened senior police officials from various provinces and cities on September 24th to hold a national police administration conference to discuss the organization, personnel, funding, public security, business, and training of police administration.

Health Administration Conference

On November 5th, the National Government's Department of Health convened the First National Health Administration Conference. Discussed items such as health administration, pharmaceutical management, public health, health education, prevention of epidemics, health insurance, travel hygiene, and health statistics.

Promote New Movement

On January 13th, the National Government convened a New Movement Promotion Conference to review the actual situation of the New Movement promotion in various places, to discuss this year's promotion plan, and to implement the General Mobilization of National Spirit. The late Chairman Wang delivered an earnest speech.

Fifth Plenary Session

In mid-January of the 32nd year (1943), the Sixth Executive Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang convened its Fifth Plenary Session in Nanjing, discussing wartime culture, economy, propaganda, and training in detail, and passing many important cases.

Efforts to Increase Production

In his New Year's Day address in the 33rd year of the Republic (1944), Chairman Wang specifically pointed out that this year is the year of general mobilization for the production increase movement. He said: "At present, the most urgent needs of the national economy and people's livelihood are clothing and food, so production increase work should start with agriculture and light industry first... The government should eliminate empty talk, come up with practical plans, and work calmly. The people should also no longer stand idly by, shaking their heads and sighing."

Under the national goal of increasing production, the National Government convened the National Economic Committee in mid-January and passed various production increase proposals. On February 9th, the Nanjing Sino-Japanese Cultural Association convened an agricultural production increase conference in various provinces to study important issues concerning production increase. At the meeting, responsible persons from various government agencies made important reports. Within a few days, an outline for promoting agricultural production increase was formulated as a preparation for advancing the work. On February 23rd, the central government convened a local administrative conference and passed important cases such as strengthening Baojia and increasing production.

Rural Clearing Conference

On February 10th, the National Government convened a rural clearing conference to review past rural clearing work and establish future plans. Many heads of ministries, departments, and commissions from the central government attended. The responsible persons from the rural clearing areas reported on the general situation of past rural clearing work. Various proposals were passed successfully. In early October, Nanjing convened the First National Security Conference to establish local public security as the focus of discussion.

Gao Huaihai Province

In mid-January, the Central Political Conference passed the establishment of Huaihai Province, and it was formally established on February 1st and began operations. The provincial government organization was reorganized from the former Suhuai Special Zone Commissioner's Office, divided into four departments: political affairs, finance, education, and construction, four offices: police affairs, security, propaganda, and health, and four bureaus: economy, social welfare, and opium suppression. Several councilors were also appointed.

Strict Opium Suppression

In the 24th year of the Republic (1935), when the late Chairman Wang was the head of the Executive Yuan, he rigorously implemented opium suppression. Implementation was suspended after the incident in the 26th year of the Republic (1937), otherwise opium would have been eradicated long ago. On February 15th of this year, the Executive Yuan of the National Government passed a draft outline of opium suppression measures, stipulating that opium should be eradicated within a three-year period starting from February of the 33rd year (1944).

Rectifying Officialdom

The government authorities have repeatedly planned to innovate the political institutions in order to adapt to the wartime system. The appointment of Zhang Boli as the Minister of Judicial Administration this year is indeed an expression of sincerely inviting talents from the private sector. In the past, the use of officials was not perfect, resulting in the suffering of unsound officialdom. After the Hu case and the food department's malfeasance occurred, the authorities made a painful decision and organized a special court of the National Government. The National Government promulgated the provisional regulations of the court and appointed Chen Enpu as the president of the special court. The case of Hou Dachun, director of the Jiangsu Food Bureau, and Hu Zheng, director of the Aquatic Products Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Food, who had major malfeasance in purchasing military food during the war, was handed over to the special court for strict trial. After the trial, Hou and Hu were sentenced to death and executed by shooting in Nanjing on March 15th. The people were very happy. The next major events of the year were the handling of the Shanghai special tax fraud case and the dereliction of duty of the personnel of the Rice Control Association.

Rectifying Local Politics

The policy that has always occupied an important position in domestic politics this year is the central government's efforts in local politics. In mid-April, the central government decided to abolish the Wuhan Headquarters of the Military Commission and establish a pacification commissioner's office. After inspecting Jiangsu Province, Interior Minister Mei Siping explained the significance of the reform of provincial administration: (1) enhancing administrative powers; (2) abolishing the three departments and two bureaus; (3) defining the relationship between the central government and the provinces; (4) establishing administrative inspector commissioner's offices. At the same time, the authorities further engaged in the reform of county administration, focusing on: (1) raising the status of county magistrates; (2) enriching county finances; (3) guaranteeing the status of county government assistant personnel; (4) re-editing the Baojia organization law; (5) promoting county local autonomy. In mid-June, the Executive Yuan approved the abolition of the special district commissioner's offices such as Nanhui, which belonged to the Shanghai Special Municipality, restoring the governance of each county and establishing administrative inspector commissioners to administer them separately.

Conserving Combat Strength

At a time when the Greater East Asia War is becoming increasingly fierce, the government authorities have been strengthening production on the one hand, and engaging in conservation movements on the other - encouraging the public to save and save during the war. In order to rectify the general public's extravagant atmosphere, the consumption special tax rate was adjusted in mid-July; the tax rate on luxury goods was increased, and the tax rate on hotel banquet special tax was changed to a progressive system.

Receiving Italian Concession

In recent years, based on the intention of respecting Chinese sovereignty in the Sino-Japanese Joint Declaration between China and Japan, the Japanese concessions in various places have been returned first, and Japan's extraterritorial rights in China have also been abolished. On July 14th of this year, the National Government implemented the reception of the Italian Concession in Tianjin. The signing ceremony of the agreement was signed in Nanjing by our Foreign Minister Chu and Italian Chargé d'Affaires Spinelli on behalf of the two governments.

Communicating Public Opinion

In the process of war participation, due to objective needs, it is necessary for the government and the people to establish public opinion organs in order to communicate up and down and become one. Shanghai is the center of national politics, economy, culture, and education. The gains and losses in its institutional aspects have the greatest impact on various places, and the complexity of various situations is also the crown of various cities. After continuous calls from the press, under the assistance of the municipal authorities and various social parties in this city, the Shanghai Special Municipality Municipal Advisory Committee was established on May 1st of this year. The consultants hired are all well-known figures in this city, such as Yan Huiqing, Li Sihao, Wen Lanting, and Chen Binyu. All suggestions can be adapted to the times and launched when the opportunity arises. The committee has become the only public opinion organ to serve the people and relieve their suffering. However, some of the committee's suggestions on food, fuel, prices, daily necessities, etc. have been considered by the authorities for various reasons.

Marching Bravely Forward

The late Chairman Wang passed away unfortunately on November 10th while receiving treatment in Japan. When the bad news came, the whole country was saddened. It was truly an irreparable loss to the country. The allied statesman, Duke Konoe, also said, "The late Chairman Wang's death is like the National Government losing its pillar." The new leader, Acting Chairman Chen, announced the policy on November 20th: "All policies decided by the late Chairman Wang will be the policies implemented by Gongbo; all facilities established by Mr. Wang during his lifetime will be the facilities implemented by Gongbo today." "The first is to cooperate with Japan to complete the Greater East Asia War, the second is to promote unification and peace, the third is to purify officialdom, the fourth is to continue production, and the fifth is to establish public security."

Military and Political Conference

In order to review the past, improve the future, and make the government and the people one, the National Military and Political Conference was held in Nanjing on November 20th. According to the Central News Agency, the conference was convened on the day of the burial of the late Chairman Wang, so the atmosphere was extremely tense and solemn. Local officials must be able to respect the posthumous teachings, abide by the resolutions, overcome all difficulties, strengthen the centralized system of military and political integration between the central government and local areas, and move forward bravely.

Sixth Plenary Session

On November 25th, the Chinese Kuomintang held an extraordinary plenary session of the Sixth Central Executive Committee at the Central Party Headquarters in Nanjing, resolving to issue a declaration. At 10:00 PM, the conference ended successfully, and the members returned to various places overnight to intensify their work.

The main points of the declaration of the conference were: to express the Kuomintang's determination to follow the past revolutionary spirit, and to continue to struggle for the national policy outlined by the Founding Father and the late Chairman Wang, in order to achieve the complete realization of the construction of a new China based on the Three Principles of the People.

Provincial Inspection Conference

On December 5th, the Ministry of Interior convened the first conference of provincial and municipal inspectors. The main task of the conference was to seek the smooth implementation of the inspector system, and to seek a seamless fit between local public security, civil administration, and reform matters with public sentiment.

### Economic Developments in Our Nation During Two Years of War Participation

— Shen You

Reorganization of National Economic Committee

On January 9th of the 32nd year of the Republic (1943), after the National Government participated in the war, the National Economic Committee was reorganized and placed under the direct jurisdiction of the National Government after being approved by the First Supreme National Defense Conference. The institution was expanded, and the chief of the North China Political Affairs Committee and celebrities in the private sector were invited to participate. The first plenary committee meeting was held on February 12th, and it was resolved to abolish regional economy, implement material control, the outline of wartime economic policy, and to emphasize agriculture. The wartime economic policy outline items include: increasing production, regulating prices, saving consumption, stabilizing the monetary system, regulating finance, and reforming economic institutions.

On June 25th, the National Economic Committee held its second general meeting and passed: (1) increasing agricultural and industrial production; (2) implementing price controls and strengthening transportation; (3) strengthening national savings; (4) establishing a national economic research institute.

Establishment of Control Organizations

In the 32nd year of the Republic (1943), all material control organizations tended to be complete: the National Commercial Control Association was established in Shanghai. This is the highest material control organization of commercial autonomy. The scope of work includes the purchase and distribution of materials in the Central China region, the banning and approval of material movement, the management of barter trade between Central China and North China, the organization of industrial and commercial groups, the procurement of military supplies, and the evaluation of the prices of various materials.

The important tasks handled by the Commercial Control Association up to the 32nd year of its establishment are summarized as follows:

(1) Visa for material movement.

(2) Registration and purchase of materials - 1. Purchase of wheat; 2. Registration and purchase of cotton yarn and cotton cloth; 3. Purchase of oil and grain; 4. Unified allocation of flour; 5. Unified allocation of eggs.

(Work of the Grain Control Association) The Rice and Grain Control Committee was established in October of the 32nd year (1943) as an external organization of the Commercial Control Association. It manages the purchase, transportation, storage, allocation, and pricing of rice and grain. An overview of the work carried out by the association after its establishment: 1. Purchase of rice and grain; 2. Allocation of rice and grain in Shanghai.

(Work of the Cotton Control Association) The Cotton Control Committee is also an external organization of the Commercial Control Association. Its duties are: the purchase and allocation of cotton in the three provinces and two cities; the supply of cotton for Sino-Japanese military needs and export, the allocation of cotton for general consumption, and the determination of cotton prices, the plan for purchasing funds and material exchange, and the review and issuance of cotton registration and transportation certificates.

Government Control Organizations

The government organizations include: the National Economic Committee - deciding on the overall economic policy, etc.; the Central Price Countermeasures Committee and local economic bureaus - deciding on prices, registering materials, etc. The adjustment of the aforementioned three control committee organizations and the implementation of the control business were decided by the Material Control Deliberation Committee.

North China Materials Committee

The North China Materials and Price Handling Committee is the controlled economic institution in North China, directly under the North China Political Affairs Committee. Its tasks are: (1) supplementing and adjusting important materials; (2) stabilizing prices of important materials and using balancing funds, (3) managing the import and export of important materials, (4) managing matters related to the purchase, storage, movement, exchange, and allocation of important materials.

Government Price Countermeasures

The price problem affects the production and distribution of materials, and is also related to the level of currency value. It is indeed the most important and most difficult problem to solve. The National Government is trying to take effective measures to deal with the soaring prices: (1) encouraging savings; (2) establishing price countermeasures agencies; (3) implementing commodity price limits; (4) expanding the scope of allocated goods; (5) cracking down on hoarding of goods; (6) purchasing materials for deferred payment.

Currency and Financial Countermeasures

The countermeasures adopted by the National Government for currency and finance are summarized as follows: (1) expanding the exchange of old and new currencies; (2) stopping the new issuance of military tickets; (3) changing the exchange rate between savings bonds and the Joint Reserve Bank; (4) expanding the scope of use of savings bonds; (5) cracking down on enemy currency; (6) borrowing from Japan; (7) rectifying the silver and money industry. The sudden increase in the number of newly established financial institutions in the 32nd year (1943) is actually a phenomenon of abnormal financial development, and the crisis of its speculative activities cannot be ignored. The objects of the authorities in this regard are: (1) restricting loans; (2) ordering increased investment; (3) cracking down on promissory notes; (4) cracking down on financial institutions.

(Resumption of Securities Exchange) Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, Chinese stock trading has become the darling of the times, with a huge impact on prices and people's livelihood. The Shanghai authorities checked the Chinese-owned stock companies in February and March of the 32nd year (1943) and ordered them to reorganize before allowing them to resume operations; stock operations were uniformly limited to spot trading. In July, the Chinese Securities Exchange officially resumed operations with the assistance of the National Government.

(Issuing Grain Treasury Bonds) Due to the importance of the grain problem and the need to raise funds for rice and grain trading, the National Government implemented 500 million yuan of grain treasury bonds.

Production Increase Movement

Under this national goal of increasing production, the National Economic Committee convened its third meeting in mid-January and passed various production increase proposals. Furthermore, the National Agricultural Production Increase Conference, chaired by the three ministers of industry, food, and construction of the National Government, was inaugurated in Nanjing on February 9th. All the proposals of the conference were important issues for promoting the production increase work, including: (1) agricultural administration, (2) rice, wheat, and miscellaneous grains, (3) mulberry, hemp, and silk, (4) water conservancy, forestry, and reclamation, (5) fishery and animal husbandry, (6) tea industry economy and agricultural technology. At the conference, the departments of industry, food, and construction all made important reports. (6) The Executive Yuan established the Agricultural Production Increase Promotion Committee, which actively formulated regulations on the promotion strategy of the production increase work. The committee formulated the "Production Increase Promotion Outline" in mid-February as a guideline for promoting the work.

At the end of March, the China Industrial Association was established in Shanghai as a bridge between the government and the people in the production increase movement.

In mid-April, the Ministry of Industry, together with the Shanghai Municipal Government, organized the Industrial and Commercial Enterprise Investigation Committee, whose purpose was to investigate the actual situation of various industrial and commercial enterprises in Shanghai in order to seek sound organization and increase production.

In late April, Chinese and Japanese groups organized the Cotton Production Increase Agreement General Association, whose purpose was to mutually connect cotton production increase agencies, in order to have effective policies for the emergency increase of cotton, and to promote implementation.

The National Government has since stated that all policies are aimed at stabilizing people's livelihood and enhancing combat power, and that it is necessary to resolutely implement a controlled economic policy.

Strengthening Finance

The National Government believes that the improper speculation of the financial community has a non-shallow impact on currency circulation. In order to promote the overall material and capital exchange and development, from March 27th, it prohibited the operation of unreasonable remittance exchanges and designated eleven banks to handle remittances in North China. On the one hand, it expanded the area of use of savings bonds and decided to unify the currency system of Huaihai Province. In addition, it obtained the understanding of the Allies, and the Japanese government insisted on the current exchange rate between Chinese currency and Japanese yen. From May 1st, the National Government further implemented its established policy in order to promote the smooth development of finance. It completely eliminated the restrictions on remittances between the North and the South, realizing the free exchange of funds in various regions, and the material exchange can obtain a leap in development from this. Soon, the Shanghai North China Trade Committee was also announced under the new system. (Loan for Central Reserve Credit) In order to strengthen the soundness of the currency system, the Central Reserve Bank signed a credit loan of 400 million Japanese yen with the Bank of Japan on August 25th of the 33rd year (1944), which will be repaid within five years. (The credit loan for North China was 200 million yuan.) The financial community was quite excited to hear the news.

Rice Price Soaring

At the end of May of this year, the government authorities announced the "Outline of Temporary Measures for People's Food in Beijing and Shanghai" in order to enrich people's food. The Japanese side also adopted the same policy in order to balance supply and demand and stabilize prices. After that, government orders have been revised repeatedly for regulating people's food. Indeed, in the past six months, the rising trend of daily necessities has been rapid, entering a state of madness, and the threat to people's lives has reached the point of being fatal. Especially rice and fuel, which cannot be missed for a day, and the high rise has actually been the leader of various living goods. This kind of periodic rise has been commonplace in the past and is not surprising, but the price rise in Central China this time is not a parabolic rise, but a straight-up trend of anti-aircraft guns. As prices rise so high, the people are becoming increasingly impoverished. Although the sharp rise in rice prices in mid-December was due to the fact that production was not ideal, coupled with various wartime relationships, public security and transportation were not perfect, the biggest conclusion was caused by the shortcomings in the personnel mechanism and the arson of profiteers. Especially the latter, the planned manipulation of profiteers is a direct cause of the recent surge in rice prices. As a result, prices of general commodities have doubled, and finance has become more turbulent; tens of thousands of yuan were added to the price in mid-December, and Chinese stocks are firm without rising - this is the trick of profiteers echoing each other. It is heard that the relevant authorities in Shanghai and the control groups of various industries are urgently discussing and dealing with the issues of rice and grain regulation, supply and demand, and suppression of selling prices, and are trying to re-issue household rice.

Industry Gloomy

The industries in the city are in a gloomy state of declining production and suspension of work due to the reduction of coal, electricity, and raw materials. Although the Allies have successively transferred a large number of factories to assist us, except for the production of military supplies and a very small number of companies, they are all sitting idly by, gradually arousing a wave of layoffs. If we do not rise up and seek remedies urgently, this kind of crisis will inevitably be more profound.

### Sino-Japanese Relations During Two Years of War

— Nomori

On December 8, 1944, with the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the late Chairman Wang of our National Government immediately issued a statement, expressing his determination to share weal and woe with Japan to overcome the crisis. The following year, on the first anniversary of the Greater East Asia War on December 8th, the late Chairman Wang again encouraged the people with the phrase "shared existence and death." On December 19th of the same month, he further traveled to Japan to achieve further Sino-Japanese cooperation. On January 9, 1943, the National Government, led by the late Chairman Wang, issued a declaration of war against Britain and the United States. Both Chinese and Japanese authorities declared their unwavering belief in complete cooperation to achieve a joint war against Britain and the United States. On the same day, at 11:00 AM, they signed the Sino-Japanese Joint Declaration. On the same day, based on the spirit of the Joint Declaration and respecting Chinese sovereignty, the National Government's Premier Wang and Japan's Special Envoy Plenipotentiary, Mamoru Shigemitsu, signed an agreement to return concessions and abolish extraterritorial rights. It stipulated that Japan should return the administrative rights of the Japanese-administered concessions in China to the Chinese government as soon as possible and promptly abolish all extraterritorial rights in China.

Recovering Concessions Across Various Regions

Consequently, China established a Concession Reception Committee, while Japan established a Concession Return Committee. On March 30th, Japanese concessions in Hangzhou, Hankou, Suzhou, Shashi, Tianjin, Fuzhou, Xiamen, and other places were completely returned and received by China. At the end of March, the National Government also received the Beijing Legation Quarter; on June 5th, France also returned the French concessions in Tianjin, Hankou, and Guangzhou to China. By July 30th, the Shanghai French Concession was officially handed over to the Chinese government. Because the International Settlement did not belong to a single country, the negotiations for its recovery were slower. The Xiamen Gulangyu International Settlement was officially completely received by China on May 28th. The Shanghai International Settlement was officially recovered by the Chinese government on August 1st.

Abolishing Extraterritorial Rights

Japan announced its abandonment of extraterritorial rights in China on the day the National Government entered the war. Italy, France, Denmark, and Spain also subsequently announced their abandonment. The Japanese government decided to first abolish taxation rights and signed the Treaty on Taxation of Japanese Nationals in China on July 31st. On September 10th, the National Government first notified Ambassador Tani of the scope within which Japanese nationals should obey Chinese laws and pay taxes.

Sino-Japanese Visits

(1) Japanese Prime Minister Hideki Tojo visited China on March 13, 1943, to thank the late Chairman Wang for his visit to Japan in December 1942 and to express respect for China's participation in the war. He held earnest talks with National Government leaders on cooperating to complete the war. (2) Special Envoy Chen Gongbo Visited Japan - The central government, in recognition of Japan's early return of concessions and the abolition of restrictions on the movement of goods, specially appointed Legislative Yuan President Chen as a special envoy to Japan on April 1st. (3) Minister Aoki Visited China - Minister Aoki of Greater East Asia Affairs visited China on August 19th to examine the situation in China after the implementation of the new policy towards China. (4) The late Chairman Wang and Chen Gongbo Visited Japan Again - To promote closer cooperation and ties between China and Japan, Chairman Wang, accompanied by Legislative Yuan President Chen Gongbo, visited Japan on September 21st. (5) Acting Premier Zhou Fohai Visited Japan. (6) General Yui Mitsuru visited China at the end of September 1944 to investigate the conditions of the people. (7) Advisor Yuuki visited China in mid-October to investigate the economy. (8) Vice-Minister Takeuchi visited China for sightseeing. (9) Premier Chen visited Japan to thank the Japanese government and people for their condolences on the death of Chairman Wang.

Sino-Japanese Alliance

In order to complete the war and build Greater East Asia, on October 30, 1943, the "Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty" was signed in Nanjing by National Government Premier Wang and Japanese Ambassador Tani Masayuki. The Basic Relations Treaty signed between China and Japan on November 30, 1940, was immediately invalidated, and Sino-Japanese relations were fully based on equal and friendly cooperation.

Greater East Asia Conference

In order to achieve close cooperation among the countries of Greater East Asia and to openly discuss the direction of Greater East Asia's construction, Japan convened the Greater East Asia Conference in Tokyo on November 5, 1943. The National Government was represented by the late Premier Wang of the Executive Yuan. Vice Premier Zhou Fohai, Foreign Minister Chu Minyi, Military Affairs Commission Chen Changzu, Executive Yuan Secretary-General Zhou Longxiang, and Deputy Secretary-General Xue Fengyuan attended. Other participants included the leaders of Japan, Manchukuo, Thailand, Burma, the Philippines, and India. The conference unanimously passed the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration, including five points: co-existence and co-prosperity, independence and amity, promotion of culture, economic prosperity, and contribution to the world. It successfully concluded on the 6th.

Promoting National Diplomacy

Leading figures in Shanghai, such as Wen Lanteng, aimed to enhance friendship with friendly nations, elevate China's international standing, and cooperate in completing the Greater East Asia War. To this end, in January 1943, they organized the National Diplomacy Promotion Association to assist the government in determining foreign policy. The association repeatedly received support from the government and from Ambassador Shigemitsu of the friendly nation. The association's goals were: autonomous renewal, promoting peace, eliminating the evil forces of Britain and the United States, implementing the teachings of the Founding Father, and protecting overseas Chinese.

Cultural Exchange

(1) Sino-Japanese Cultural Association - Established in July 1940, this association was a practical organ for Sino-Japanese cultural exchange. In April 1943, the association held a national congress in Hankou, passing resolutions to exchange Chinese and Japanese professors and students, promote the East Asian Renaissance, and restore universities and libraries in the peace zones.

(2) Greater East Asia Literary Conference - The Second Greater East Asia Literary Conference opened in Tokyo on August 25th. The National Government specially sent Zhou Yueran, Tao Kangde, and 14 others to participate. On November 12, 1944, the Third Greater East Asia Literary Conference opened in Nanjing, China, and Qian Daosun was elected as chairman.

(3) Greater East Asia Press Conference - In order to complete the Greater East Asia War and launch an ideological war, the Japan Newspaper Association specially invited press representatives from various countries in the Co-Prosperity Sphere to Tokyo in mid-November to hold the Third Greater East Asia Press Conference. China's representatives included Xu Liqiu and Chen Binhe, among 14 others.

(4) Shanghai Tongwen College University, in order to assist China in promoting wartime culture, donated 3 million Japanese yen to various cultural institutions in China. China's cultural circles expressed great excitement about this.

Transfer of Enemy Property

After the National Government returned to its capital, Japan gradually returned former enemy property to the National Government for management. After the National Government entered the war, new enemy property from Britain and the United States was also transferred to the Chinese side in batches. All state-owned companies were also actively adjusted. In addition, all ownerless property was transferred in early 1944. The Japanese side stated: "It is hoped that after China receives this transferred property, it will be properly handled to stabilize the people's livelihood and complete the Greater East Asia War."

Transfer of Guangzhouwan

On March 1, 1944, the Japanese military authorities in South China announced the removal of military administration from the Guangzhouwan area, incorporating it under the jurisdiction of the Guangdong Provincial Government, and formally designating it as a peace zone. The Governor of Guangdong Province and the Japanese military commander jointly signed an agreement to transfer it to the National Government's jurisdiction.

New Policy Implementation

The Japanese government, with the new policy toward China as its core, smoothly resolved special circumstances in various aspects and forged unity with the Chinese government. Japanese Ambassador to China Tani Masayuki, with this goal in mind, traveled extensively throughout southern and northern China, engaging in sincere discussions with various parties. It is believed that, through the concerted efforts of both sides, the key points of the new policy will be resolved satisfactorily. The Japanese side also stated that it would spare no support in helping to build a new China, and would not stand idly by in regard to China's commodity price and food policies, agricultural production increase, and light industry revitalization. At the same time, it hoped that the Chongqing side would deeply understand its sincerity. In short, China and Japan should make the greatest efforts to complete the war. After Mr. Ogura took office as the National Government's top economic advisor, he frequently exchanged views with leaders from all walks of life in China, doing his utmost to assist in the development of China's economy and secure resources for the war.

Unwavering to the End

The Japanese Tojo cabinet, in order to address the major war situation and renew morale, resigned en masse on July 18th. The successors were Generals Koiso Kuniaki and Yonai Mitsumasa, who formed a strong cabinet and emerged with a new appearance to adapt to the new situation. The Chinese and Japanese governments jointly declared that they would continue to uphold the spirit of past alliances, concentrate human and material resources, and jointly advance toward defeating Britain and the United States in order to achieve final victory. The late Chairman Wang, on the anniversary of the signing of the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty, stated in his address: "Reports are frequently received across the Pacific that the forces of Britain and the United States invading East Asia are weakening day by day... The light of our victory is becoming increasingly evident amidst the liberation of East Asia... Looking back on the past, we are naturally even more excited and confident."

The late Chairman Wang initially went to Japan for medical treatment due to a recurring back ailment. During his convalescence, he received great attention from the Japanese government and people, and was treated by medical authorities who utilized every possible modern medical method. Unfortunately, he did not recover. The Japanese side was shocked to hear the tragic news, with some even shedding tears, believing that the Chairman was not only the head of China but also a pioneer of East Asia, demonstrating the depth of his personal charisma. After the Chairman's death, Chen Gongbo was appointed acting chairman by the central government. The Japanese government expressed its deep expectations. Prime Minister Koiso further stated that upon hearing of Mr. Chen's succession, he rejoiced for the Chinese people and for the future of East Asia as a whole, and that in order to thoroughly defeat the aggressive forces of Britain and the United States, protect East Asia, and build a new China, Japan would spare no effort in supporting the Chinese National Government. Acting Chairman Chen also stated that the Chinese National Government would not waver due to the progress of the war. China's participation in the war was not only for its own liberation but also for the liberation of all ethnic groups in Greater East Asia. For itself, it was a matter of justice and humanity, and for Japan, it was also a matter of justice and friendship.
