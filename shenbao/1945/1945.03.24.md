### War Results of Japanese Air Force Attacks: Ten Enemy Ships Sunk, 180 Enemy Planes Shot Down - Announcement by Japanese General Headquarters

Tokyo, 23rd (Central News Agency dispatch) – Japanese General Headquarters announced at 4:00 PM on the 23rd: (1) According to subsequent investigations, the confirmed combined war results of the Japanese air force's attacks on the enemy mobile task force between March 18th and 21st are as follows: Five regular aircraft carriers, one battleship, three cruisers, and one ship of unknown type were sunk; approximately 180 enemy aircraft were shot down. The Japanese side has not recovered 150 aircraft, and damage on the ground and on the water is minor. (2) The majority of the Japanese attack aircraft were part of special attack units. Furthermore, there are unconfirmed war results.

Tokyo, 23rd (Central News Agency dispatch) – Since the 18th, the Japanese air force has been fiercely attacking the enemy American mobile task force that appeared in the sea south of Kyushu. By the 21st, the surviving enemy ships began retreating south at full speed. The goal of the Japanese air force attack was aircraft carriers. After the enemy ships retreated, the battle situation in that area has ended. The enemy ships have escaped the Japanese air raid range and may reorganize and act again in the future. The Japanese side is currently preparing.

A Certain Base, 23rd (Central News Agency dispatch) – On the 18th and 19th, the Japanese military air force intercepted the enemy mobile task force attacking the Japanese mainland at sea, ultimately inflicting heavy damage and causing them to retreat. The enemy's attempt to continuously attack suffered a tremendous setback. Regarding the enemy aircraft carrying out indiscriminate machine-gunning, the mobile task force at sea suffered heavy bombing by Japanese aircraft. Japanese air force personnel described the situation after the sortie at the base on the 21st as follows: On the 18th, at midnight, they departed from the base in succession, advancing at a low altitude of 1,000 meters. At that time, the enemy's naval gunfire was extremely intense, confirming the enemy's location. After the Japanese military dropped flares, the enemy fleet's mobile task force in a column formation was clearly visible. At this time, enemy night fighters took off from the aircraft carriers. Japanese Type 1 and Type 2 torpedo bombers dived in succession. After releasing its torpedo, the Type 2 aircraft flew close to the enemy ship and confirmed that the torpedo had hit the bow, causing flames to erupt and the ship to list. The subsequent Type 3 aircraft also descended to an altitude of 100 meters and damaged a 45,000-ton battleship. When continuing the second attack in the evening, another ship of unknown type was sunk.

### At the House of Representatives Budget Committee Session: The Japanese Prime Minister Expresses Resolve - Full Preparation for the Homeland Becoming a Battlefield

Tokyo, 23rd (Central News Agency dispatch) – With the 100 million Japanese people unanimously hoping for a swift offensive, Mr. Taizo Ide questioned the government about its resolve on this point at the House of Representatives Budget Committee session on the 23rd. Prime Minister Koiso explained, and the Army and Navy Ministers also gave similar replies. Mr. Ogata, Director of the Information Bureau, and Mr. Yoshida, Minister of Munitions, also clarified the policies of shifting to an offensive stance in public opinion guidance and munitions production, respectively. A summary of the main points is as follows: Prime Minister Koiso stated that the recent notion that the people must be prepared for the homeland becoming a battlefield means completing preparations to wait for an opportunity to destroy the enemy. Because we are not only determined not to allow the enemy to land easily, but we must also have the determination to quickly take the offensive and recapture Iwo Jima, Saipan, and even Guadalcanal. Army Minister Sugiyama stated that under the current situation, there is full preparation for the homeland becoming a battlefield. At the same time, in the vast Pacific Ocean, Rabaul, Truk, the Philippines, and the islands north of there, our soldiers are still continuing their heroic resistance. This is simply to fight in defense of the enemy forces, and that is the meaning of Prime Minister Koiso's explanation. Navy Minister Yonai stated that in today's situation, an offensive must be taken to break the deadlock.

Foreign Minister Shigemitsu Responds to Questions

Tokyo, 23rd (Central News Agency dispatch) – On the afternoon of the 23rd, at the House of Representatives Budget Committee session, Mr. Yūsuke Tsurumi engaged in the following question-and-answer session with Foreign Minister Shigemitsu regarding current diplomatic issues:

Mr. Yūsuke Tsurumi: The results of the Crimean Conference have exposed the flaws in the enemy camp's war ideology. Such actions by the British and American governments present a good opportunity for our diplomatic offensive. What are the Foreign Minister's thoughts on this?

Foreign Minister Shigemitsu: The purpose of war is the soul of the war itself. A war without a soul cannot be won. The enemy is trying to compromise with expediency, which contradicts their war goals. We consistently uphold justice and move towards completing our goals.

Mr. Tsurumi: During the Dumbarton Oaks Conference, the government issued statements both domestically and internationally refuting the post-war settlement plan. In my opinion, it should be thoroughly crushed. What are your thoughts on this? Will the Imperial government present its post-war world settlement plan on April 25th to refute their plan?

Foreign Minister Shigemitsu: The key points of the enemy's post-war international organization plan are three: First, political and economic monopolization of the world. Second, great powers establishing dictatorial rule through power. Third, disregarding small countries and nationalities, and interfering in the internal affairs of other countries under the guise of democracy. That is, they use power and dictatorship to run rampant in the world. Our side, from the beginning of the war, proclaimed in the Imperial Rescript the liberation of nations and the foundation of stable people's livelihoods, and the spirit of mutual benefit and equality as our ideals. They are pursuing an international armed peace, while we are based on international justice. They believe that the San Francisco Conference will discuss preparations for the next stage of operations. At this time, I also agree to present a post-war world organization plan. However, our ideals are already included in the Five Great Principles of Greater East Asia.

### North China Representatives Go to Beijing to Attend People's Congress

Editorial

### Evacuation of Charitable Organizations: Points to Note

The city's evacuation committee is now actively carrying out its work, with particular emphasis on waterway and land transportation issues. Specialized committees have been formed to promote this work. The first to be evacuated have been determined to be charitable organizations. The executive group of the committee, together with the Social Welfare Bureau, convened a meeting with representatives of various charitable organizations on the 19th of this month, announced the main points of the evacuation measures, and designated a one-month preparation period. After one month, the committee will determine a date and notify the charitable organizations to be evacuated one week in advance. We elaborated on this in the editorial on the 20th of this month, hoping to provide charitable organizations with reference for their relocation preparations. Time flies, and the one-month preparation period will pass quickly. Charitable organizations should quickly handle all the various issues related to how to implement the evacuation themselves. Once notified, they can relocate in an orderly manner. We will further elaborate on our observations as follows:

(1) The authorities have fully decided that charitable organizations will be evacuated first, and a one-month preparation period has been stipulated. Therefore, the authorities of each charitable organization should devote all their efforts to preparing for the relocation. Issues such as the preservation of property after relocation will be handled by the authorities, so there is no need to worry too much, which may lead to neglect of the current preparation work, resulting in chaos and unnecessary losses when the time comes.

(2) It is better to rely on oneself than to rely on others. Within the scope of one's own capabilities, one should make full use of one's own resources. Although the evacuation committee will provide full assistance, it is only general. Therefore, each charitable organization should proactively make all necessary preparations and avoid a dependent mentality.

(3) Charitable organizations of similar religions and natures should openly discuss and merge if possible. At the very least, they should jointly establish a liaison organization to cooperate with each other. In this extraordinary period and environment, in order to ensure the survival of the cause, it is even more necessary to abandon the usual separatist opinions and only consider what is beneficial to the common goal. Even if it means sacrificing personal prejudices, it should be done.

(4) The economic conditions of each charitable organization vary. A faithful report should be made to the authorities to provide an accurate reference for subsidies. Those who believe that their economic capacity is sufficient to cover the cost of relocation and maintenance for a certain period of time can reduce the burden on the evacuation committee and, at the same time, reduce the difficulties for other truly poor organizations. The purpose of charitable organizations is to save people as their only creed. Since we are all saving people, there should be no selfish views and adherence to narrow boundaries.

(5) Only absolutely necessary items should be carried during the relocation. The simpler, the better. Because the lack of transportation is a de facto constraint, and transportation capacity is extremely limited. Although the evacuation committee provides special vehicles and ships, it is also general. Bulky items must be restricted. Therefore, one must consider this during preparation and choose lightweight luggage as much as possible.

### Trends in the Capital

– By Ren Ping

The Rice Market Turns Danger into Safety

The rice market, which has always been a topic of discussion in the capital city, is unpredictable, with prices rising and falling from time to time, and goods appearing and disappearing. Since the Capital City Materials Evaluation and Discipline Committee listed rice as the most important of the eight essential commodities and strictly enforced the crackdown on hoarding, the price of rice once fell. Later, due to a shortage of sources, the price rose again. Although the Evaluation and Discipline Committee authorities limited the price to no more than 20,000 yuan per shih (unit of dry measure, about 100 liters), the rampant black market and lack of goods on the market led to a standstill in transactions.

Recently, in order to stabilize people's livelihoods, the authorities opened up the transport of rice into the city, starting on March 9th, expanding the limit of 8 kilograms to 80 kilograms. On the one hand, outside the Zhonghua Gate, the municipal government and the Rice Control Association jointly established a joint office for rice registration and management to handle the registration and certification of rice merchants or organizations transporting more than one shih of rice. The price of rice on the market is also handled temporarily by this office based on the situation in the production areas. Since then, the rice market, which had disappeared in the city, has seen a revival, and the rice shops have been filled with rice again. After the lifting of the ban, the price of rice once fell to 30,000 yuan, but it has now risen slightly. The price of rice in the past two months can be compared as follows:

(1) Before January 27th – the highest price was 24,000 yuan per shih (during the controlled period).

(2) From January 27th to February 12th – the highest price was 20,000 yuan per shih, the lowest price was 17,000 yuan per shih (during the period of the establishment of the Evaluation and Discipline Committee, free trading).

(3) From February 13th to February 21st (the rice market was suspended during the Lunar New Year period).

(4) From February 22nd to March 8th – the highest price was 40,000 yuan per shih, the lowest price was 26,000 yuan per shih (the authorities announced a new price limit of 20,000 yuan per shih, the black market gradually rose, and there were no goods on the market).

(5) From March 9th to the present – the highest price is 38,000 yuan per shih, the lowest price is 34,000 yuan per shih.

From this, we can see the changing situation of rice prices in the capital city. Now, because the authorities are making great efforts to dredge the rice source, and at the same time, they have reversed the past rigid price limit system, the source of supply has suddenly become more active.

Recently, in order to prevent merchants from taking the opportunity to hoard and manipulate prices, the relevant departments have stipulated a new "purchasing rice based on population" method on March 18th, stipulating that each household is calculated based on the number of people in the original rice purchase certificate, with adults being able to purchase two dou (unit of dry measure, about 10 liters) per month and children one dou, and the selling store stamps the purchase certificate. If this method can be successfully implemented, then the waves of rice prices may come to an end.

Arrest of Corrupt Employees of China Railway

Since the case of Jiang Shiyan, a "black hat" (derogatory term for railway staff) of China Railway at Shanghai North Station, beating female passenger Xu Peiwen to death, not only has all sectors of Shanghai been deeply angered, but the people of the whole country have paid close attention. The Ministry of Construction authorities, in their capacity as the competent authority, have strictly ordered the company to investigate and report on the handling of the case, and to strictly arrest the criminal and bring him to justice. At the same time, ten "Measures to Eliminate Improper Conduct of Employees" have been formulated and strictly implemented.

At the same time, there is a particularly gratifying piece of news: a group of villains who specialized in stealing luggage cars and luggage from warehouses at Pukou and Xiaguan stations have been arrested in Beijing. These rampant lawbreakers have accumulated numerous cases, and are widely criticized by the public. After investigation by the authorities, it was learned that it was the work of an organized theft gang, with a total of 300 members, most of whom were "black hats" and railway stokers and laborers. Dozens of them have been arrested, including nine ringleaders, who will be severely punished by military law. The remaining accomplices who have not been captured are being closely investigated.

Eliminating the corrupt officials of China Railway should be a major event in alleviating the suffering of the people.

Talking about Electricity Conservation Amidst Calls for Economy

Last year, due to the lack of coal in Beijing, the water and electricity authorities announced a zoning electricity conservation system before 10:00 PM every night, which has been in place for several months. Except for military institutions, all lights must be turned off after 10:00 PM. Statistics show that the maximum time electricity can be used per day is only two to three hours.

The restrictions on electricity use for ordinary users are now quite strict. Businesses and institutions are treated more leniently, while households are treated more strictly. The minimum limit for households is 13 degrees per month. If this is exceeded for the first time, a fine will be imposed. The second time, the electricity will be cut off. In addition, the principle of one light per household is stipulated. In the past, dozens of stores and households were cut off. Now everyone is paying attention. Therefore, the market in Confucius Temple becomes a dark world at night.

In mid-February of this year, Beijing experienced a coal shortage, and the city's electricity supply was almost cut off. Later, the relevant authorities managed to maintain it.

Recently, due to the shortage of coal and the increase in costs, the water and electricity company authorities have been approved by the Ministry of Construction to increase the electricity fee from 30 yuan to 110 yuan per degree, starting in March, an increase of more than three times.

### Recent International Situation Prospects (3) — Minister Matsudaira's Broadcast Speech —

(7) Reactions to the Crimea Conference

What kind of reactions did the Crimea Conference evoke in various countries? Many countries believed that the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union were acting too independently, and even within the UK and the US, there were expressions of opposition.

The first to object was de Gaulle, who said in a broadcast on February 5th, "It is incomprehensible why the UK, the US, and the Soviet Union are discussing international issues without France's presence. France will not be bound by this agreement."  Roosevelt intended to meet with de Gaulle to inform him of the decisions made at the Crimea Conference using a private messenger, and to encourage him to attend the San Francisco Conference, promising to include France as one of the presiding nations. However, de Gaulle refused to meet, taking a firm stance, stating that unless the decisions made at the Crimea Conference and Dumbarton Oaks were revised, he would firmly refuse to attend the San Francisco Conference, making it difficult for the US to handle.  As a result, the US immediately dispatched Presidential Secretary O’Leary to Paris to seek de Gaulle's understanding. Simultaneously, the US criticized de Gaulle's attitude as being too rigid.

The next to express opposition was the Polish government-in-exile, which issued a statement on February 13th, believing that the UK and US, taking advantage of others' unpreparedness, casually propped up another Poland, causing Poland to suffer the tragedy of being divided for the fifth time. This was an action that violated the Atlantic Charter. Even US Communist Senator Burton Browne criticized the error of this action, and he stated that if he were appointed as a US representative to the San Francisco Conference, he would firmly resign.

Another point of criticism was that the terms for Germany were too harsh. According to Roosevelt's explanation, Germany was forced to surrender unconditionally, and a joint administrative committee of the UK, the US, the Soviet Union, and France would be organized in Berlin to govern it. Furthermore, the Nazi Party would be completely destroyed, laws changed, militarism dismantled, military equipment and munitions production facilities destroyed, and factories, machinery, vehicles, and industrial raw materials would be used to compensate for all losses. Their objective was to render Germany prostrate. Roosevelt said in his speech at the joint session of the two houses of Congress on March 1st, "We do not want to starve the German people," or "This purpose is not to poison the German people." However, when meeting with journalists the next day, the journalists questioned whether unconditional surrender would not enslave Germany, causing Roosevelt to argue until he was drenched in sweat.

(8) San Francisco Conference

The so-called San Francisco Conference is scheduled to be held in San Francisco on April 25th, at which time the specific provisions of the peace organization will be discussed and agreed upon. The UK, the US, the Soviet Union, France, Chongqing, and other smaller countries that have been forced to declare war on the Axis powers will participate. Of course, the San Francisco Conference is the proposal of the United States, and the date of April 25th was specifically chosen, and the location is San Francisco on the Pacific coast, with the intention of demonstrating against Japan. American newspapers claim that holding the conference on April 25th, the fourth anniversary of the signing of the Soviet-Japanese Neutrality Pact, has profound significance. The Chongqing Ta Kung Pao, in its editorial on February 15th, cited the American argument and speculated that the Soviet Union would declare war on Japan.

The conference will review the international organization determined by Dumbarton Oaks, but the countries have already fallen out within a month of the previous conference. As mentioned above, France has firmly expressed its opposition. Similarly, on March 7th, Mr. Emrys-Evans, a Liberal Party Member of Parliament in the UK, raised objections in The Times of London, pointing out that the voting system of the international organization was unreasonable, and that when disputes arose between large and small countries, large countries would not be bound by this organization, resulting in small countries suffering losses. On March 15th, Labour Party MP David Davies and Liberal Party MP Harris also questioned Churchill on this issue, but Churchill was unable to answer, only saying that things would not proceed entirely according to ideals.

It is also unknown whether Syria and Lebanon will participate in the conference.  Furthermore, Transjordan expressed resentment for not being invited to participate in the conference.

Washington had stated in a broadcast two or three days ago that the conference would not discuss the issues of colonial residents or the national borders of European countries. Their intention was to silence the countries in advance, always thinking of their own interests.

(9) Conclusion

In this war, the international phenomenon that can be seen is entirely the nationalistic spirit expressed by various countries and peoples. Whether in the Greater East Asia region or in Europe, this atmosphere of nationalism is extremely strong, like the rise of national self-determination during the First World War.

If world politicians understand this trend and implement world politics, then world humanity can progress and develop; otherwise, it will create a world of the survival of the fittest. Do Roosevelt and Churchill have the ability to promote world progress? Judging from their current practices, they have already lost this qualification, so overwhelming them would contribute to the progress of the world. (To be continued)

According to news from the City Chemical Industry Guild, the industry currently has over one hundred factories. Since last year, they have been unable to operate due to the suspension of power supply, and production has been interrupted. However, the employee costs of each factory are huge, making it difficult to maintain operations, and they are forced to face the risk of dissolution.

### Paper Shop Disobeys Price Limits - Investigated and Attempts Bribery

Since the City Economic Bureau approved and announced the new price limits for major commodities to suppress prices, most merchants have complied with the price limits. However, there are still many who secretly sell above the price limits while pretending to comply. In order to effectively enforce the new price limits, the bureau, in consultation with the police authorities related to economic affairs, has dispatched a large number of investigators to secretly investigate by district. Those merchants found to be selling above the price limits are punished according to law. It is reported that the bureau recently dispatched investigators to investigate Lixin Paper Shop at No. 226 Shandong Road, which purchased 25 reams of newsprint from Wenyuan Paper Shop at No. 7 Jianli, Jixiang Street, at an actual price of 35,500 yuan per ream, and sold it to Zhengxing Shop for 40,000 yuan, which greatly exceeded the price limit. Unexpectedly, the owner of Wenyuan Shop was investigated by the authorities for exceeding the price limit and, fearing punishment, immediately bribed the investigator with 40,000 yuan in cash in an attempt to cover up the matter. The investigator immediately brought the bribe back to the bureau, reported the facts truthfully, and transferred the money and the person to the City Police Department for investigation and punishment according to law.

### Inventor of X-Rays - Roentgen's Centenary Birthday - Academic Circles in the City Scheduled to Hold Commemorative Meeting

### Obligatory Elementary School Buildings - School Authorities Generously Agreed to Lend

In order to save out-of-school children and subsidize the lives of unemployed teachers, our organization plans to run obligatory elementary schools, tentatively starting with ten schools. After half a month of active preparation, everything is basically ready. Issues such as borrowing school buildings, selecting teachers, collecting books, raising funds, and setting the curriculum are being carried out separately and must be completed this month. We can now inform all enthusiastic individuals in the community that the selection of teachers has been carried out by interviewing each of the more than 50 registered teachers individually and carefully selecting them based on their knowledge, experience, physical fitness, and spirit of service, and they will be hired today. The number of books collected is also considerable. The school authorities in each district have enthusiastically supported us by happily lending school buildings and are willing to cooperate. This great spirit of empathy and willingness to do what is right is very admirable. The following eight schools have already been decided to be borrowed:

(1) Chengyu Elementary School, No. 56 Dasheng Lane, Xiaodongmen, Nanshi
(2) Shaoxing Shanghai Third Elementary School, No. 324 Jian Road (Carre Road)
(3) Zhengxing Girls' High School, No. 162 Luoyang Road (Seward Road)
(4) Yuguang Elementary School, No. 153 Lane, Jiading Road (Carter Road)
(5) Wenguang Middle and Elementary School, south of Jiangning Road (Gordon Road) and Huaian Road (Mackinnon Road)
(6) Ganggong Middle and Elementary School, north of Changning Road (Brenan Road) No. 22
(7) Hubei Middle and Elementary School, north of North Shanxi Road and Anqing Road (Arnaud Road)
(8) Shugong Elementary School, No. 94 Wuzhou Road

Several other schools have also sent letters agreeing to lend their buildings, and we will send personnel to contact them today to make a decision.

### Impoverished Students Help Impoverished Students, Donating Money and Books

(1) The entire student body of Zhaoguang Obligatory Elementary School wrote: "Recently, we read in your newspaper about the launch of obligatory elementary schools to rescue out-of-school children, and we were all deeply moved and expressed our sympathy! We are also students of obligatory elementary schools, and before we came to obligatory elementary schools, we also deeply suffered from the painful taste of being out of school, so we feel more sympathy for the general out-of-school children. However, we are all very poor and have difficulty making a living, so we don't have much ability to help. We can only do our best to first put together the snack money we usually save, totaling 12,850 yuan in savings currency, to be used as 'Obligatory School Funds', and old books: Chinese, arithmetic, and general knowledge, totaling 224 copies, to be used as obligatory school textbooks to express our hundreds of passionate hearts, and we will do our best to donate in the future. However, there are many out-of-school children in Shanghai, and a large amount of funding is needed, so we must mobilize the power of the entire society to achieve satisfactory results; therefore, we hope that people from all walks of life who are enthusiastic about education and all students in Shanghai will respond enthusiastically, accumulating small amounts to make a large amount, and gathering together, so that the general out-of-school children who need to be rescued can enjoy the happiness of reading and become useful talents, which is not only the happiness of out-of-school children, but also the happiness of the society and the country!"

(2) Shen Wenying, Chen Meiyu, Zhang Cuizhen, Zhang Juemin, Wang Cuidi, Wang Shaozhi, Zhou Pixian, and Jue Yuanxi, students of the Second Grade B class of the Ningbo Fellow Villagers Association First Elementary School, wrote: "Today, when we went to school, we heard Teacher Zhou Wenbo say that your newspaper is launching the 'Obligatory School Funds' campaign to prepare to open obligatory elementary schools, and he said that there are many people out of school now. We were very moved when we heard this. After school in the afternoon, we asked our mothers to save ten days' worth of snack money, totaling 6,000 yuan, to be used as 'Obligatory School Funds'. In the future, we will donate again, and we hope that your newspaper will tell this method to the children of other schools and have them do the same!"

Donating Books in Response to Obligatory Elementary Schools

Li Yanling wrote: "I am sending 119 copies of national elementary school textbooks and 122 copies of high school textbooks to your organization for the needs of your obligatory school. A few volumes are a small expression of my sympathy for helping education." Li's enthusiasm is extremely appreciated. All national elementary school textbooks, Chinese, general knowledge, and arithmetic, whether new or old, are welcome. We respectfully hope that people from all walks of life will donate.
