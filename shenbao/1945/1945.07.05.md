### Japanese Troops in Bali-Papan Firmly Defend Their Positions and Fight Vigorously; Australian Army's Left Flank Suffers Fierce Counterattack

Southwest Pacific Base, 4th (Central News Agency dispatch) - Japanese garrison troops in Bali-Papan are still firmly defending their front-line positions, continuing to fight vigorously.

### Zhejiang Provincial Governor Ding Orders Strict Prohibition of Extortion from Merchants and Travelers

Hangzhou, 4th (Central News Agency dispatch) - Zhejiang Provincial Governor Ding recently received reports that security teams and police officers in various counties are stationing personnel at key passes, privately extorting money or seizing goods from passing merchants and travelers, effectively setting up checkpoints to collect taxes. For example, on the line from Hangzhou to Fuyang, there are more than forty tax checkpoints along the way. In most of these important transportation routes, merchants and travelers are not only losing money and goods, but also being subjected to humiliation and delays, causing them all kinds of suffering beyond description. Governor Ding was greatly angered upon verifying these reports. He has strictly ordered all security teams, police bureaus, and county magistrates in the province to strictly prohibit such practices and has instructed administrative inspectors and commissioners of administrative inspection and security command headquarters in each district to conduct strict on-the-spot investigations. Violators will be severely punished.

### China Reserve Bank of Xuzhou Restricts Exchange of 100-Yuan Notes

Xuzhou, 4th (Central News Agency dispatch) - Recently, 100-yuan notes of the China Reserve Bank have been extremely scarce in this city, and it is very difficult to find them in the market. Speculators are taking advantage of this to profit, exchanging 800 yuan in 100-yuan notes for 1,000 yuan in larger denominations. It is learned that this is because small merchants are taking 100-yuan notes to Kaifeng and Shangqiu areas, and they are not flowing back into the city, leading to a shortage. The China Reserve Bank of Xuzhou has imposed restrictions on the exchange of 100-yuan notes.

### Molotov Hosts Banquet for Soong Tzu-wen

Moscow, 4th (Central News Agency dispatch) - Soong Tzu-wen and his party visited the Kremlin at 12:00 PM on the 2nd, accompanied by Soviet Ambassador to Chongqing, Petrov, Tang Jin, Director of the Far East Department of the People's Committee, and his father-in-law, and Deputy Director, Vashikov. They first visited the National Armory, which displays historical artifacts of great value from the Tsarist era. They then visited various cannons and other historical monuments manufactured during the era of Peter the Great. Soong Tzu-wen and his party all signed the guest book upon leaving the room.

Central News Agency dispatch from TASS, Moscow: Molotov, Deputy Chairman of the Council of People's Commissars and People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs of the Soviet Union, and his wife, hosted a banquet on the 3rd to welcome Soong Tzu-wen and representatives of the diplomatic corps. Attendees included Soong Tzu-wen, Hu Shih-tse, Chuan Bing-chang, Shen Hong-lie, as well as ambassadors, ministers, charges d'affaires, military attaches, heads of military delegations, and members, important Soviet officials, writers, actors, artists, and representatives of the Soviet and foreign press.

Japanese Ambassador Oshima Goes to America to Prepare for Prisoner Exchange

Lisbon, 4th (Central News Agency dispatch) - According to a dispatch from Salzburg, the 33 members of the Japanese embassy staff in Germany, including Japanese Ambassador to Germany Oshima, boarded a plane for America on the 2nd. It is said that the purpose of this trip to America is to prepare for a prisoner exchange after being arrested by the American army. He was detained in Salzburg.

Soong Tzu-wen's Visit to the Soviet Union and the Three-Headed Meeting

Tokyo, 4th (Central News Agency dispatch) - Soong Tzu-wen, President of the Executive Yuan of Chongqing, returned to Chongqing from San Francisco on the 20th. On the 26th, he departed for Moscow with 11 attendants, including Wei Tao-ming, the ambassador to the United States, Shen Hong-lie, and Chiang Ching-kuo. Previously, Soong had planned to visit Moscow on his way back to China from San Francisco, but the reason why he suddenly returned to China was undoubtedly to discuss the United States' views on the Soviet Union and East Asian issues with Chiang Kai-shek. If Soong Tzu-wen's visit to the Soviet Union fails to resolve the relationship between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, then their relationship will inevitably deteriorate. At the same time, it is to probe the Soviet Union's views as the backing of Yan'an, in order to seek a compromise plan. Moreover, Soong's visit to the Soviet Union is closely related to the upcoming three-headed meeting of Stalin, Churchill, and Truman. According to observations by current influential figures, the focus of the three-headed meeting will be on East Asian issues, especially the Soviet Union's East Asian policy. During the previous Pujin meeting's visit to Moscow, he seemed to have discussed with the Soviet Union "what kind of status and efforts the Soviet Union hopes to have in East Asia in the future, and to what extent the United States will concede in East Asia." Therefore, it is not difficult to understand that Soong Tzu-wen will definitely take into account the opinions of the US authorities and proceed along its lines. Therefore, the Soviet Union's attitude towards Chongqing and East Asia after the three-headed meeting will be obvious. In short, the focus of the confrontation between the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union has now shifted to East Asia. The future results of Soong's visit to the Soviet Union and the three-headed meeting are worthy of attention.

### Japanese Ambassador Oshima Goes to America to Prepare for Prisoner Exchange

Lisbon, 4th (Central News Agency dispatch) - According to a dispatch from Salzburg, the 33 members of the Japanese embassy staff in Germany, including Japanese Ambassador to Germany Oshima, boarded a plane for America on the 2nd.

### Chongqing Political Consultative Conference Scheduled for the 7th

Furthermore, the telegram stated that the compromise between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party is still hopeless. Chiang Kai-shek has urgently dispatched seven members of the National Socialist Party, including Huang Yanpei, to Yan'an for negotiations, hoping that Yan'an will send representatives. It is currently unknown whether Yan'an will overcome its prejudices and agree to send personnel to attend the National Political Consultative Conference.

### Japanese Foreign Ministry Announces Appointment

Editorial

### Speaking Out for Impoverished Students

Dear readers, this newspaper has repeatedly appealed to you on behalf of impoverished students, and has repeatedly received your enthusiastic assistance, achieving the goal of fundraising for scholarships in previous years, allowing thousands of impoverished students to study with peace of mind. This newspaper, in its role as organizer, respectfully extends the highest respect to you all.

Now, the ninth scholarship fundraising campaign begins again today. We hope that you will make another effort, donate generously, and enthusiastically solicit donations.

As everyone knows, education is the most fundamental plan for the country, and young students are where the country's glorious future lies. In today's world of rising living standards and an increasing number of young people out of school, the nation should jointly shoulder the responsibility of educating young students. Regardless of whose children they are, young students are the common successors of the next generation from the perspective of the country. The growth of young students is the growth of the country and the nation. The increase in the knowledge and skills of young students is the development of the spirit of the country and the nation. No matter how difficult our own current situation is or how difficult life is, we must hope that young students will be able to shoulder the important task of building a new China in the future.

The most admirable among young students are the outstanding children from impoverished families. Although their economic conditions are very difficult, they still bury themselves in hard study, strive to improve themselves, and many of them are at the top of their class. Dear readers, throughout history, both in China and abroad, many famous people have struggled their way out of poverty and hard study, and many great undertakings have been created by people from humble backgrounds. We believe that among these impoverished students, there are many outstanding talents, and it can be predicted that they will do a lot for the country and the nation in the future. Their ambition to improve themselves is sufficient to guarantee that they will be important pillars of the country in the future, and their spirit of hard study is truly a symbol of the country's promising future. We should provide the greatest possible assistance to these students from impoverished families with excellent grades, so that they will not drop out of school halfway due to economic pressure, and at the same time cultivate talented individuals for the country.

Moreover, helping with education has always been a virtue in China. The scholarship movement is different from general relief movements. While the work of supporting the elderly and raising infants is also very meaningful, it is of a passive and maintenance nature, while the scholarship movement has a positive and creative nature. The scholarship movement is not just about cultivation and irrigation, but we can see seedlings growing in the future, and we can look forward to blossoming and bearing fruit.

Continuing on, dear readers: The result of the hard work of the newspaper's past eight scholarship movements is the crystallization of the spirit of mutual assistance among you, the readers. The goal of this ninth session, according to our estimates, requires 300 million yuan, divided into honorary teams of 1 million yuan and ordinary teams of 100,000 yuan. Although this number is higher than in previous years, in terms of the proportion of rising prices, 300 million yuan is only the minimum limit. Now there are less than two months before the start of the new semester, we ask all readers to consistently support this scholarship movement as always, and work together to achieve the goal of this session.

When fundraising last time, many schools and national entities worked hard to participate in the coercive movement, and many industrial and commercial circles provided various assistance. More than a dozen enthusiastic people either showed off their talents, saved money, or volunteered to make the last scholarship quickly completed. This time it starts in the sweltering summer heat, I hope all the people in Shanghai will use the same enthusiasm to help the scholarship movement.

This newspaper speaks out for impoverished students with the most sincere attitude, hoping that dear readers will make the greatest effort, donate generously, and enthusiastically solicit donations.

### Minhang Today

— Ba Ling

Industry and Commerce Overview

Minhang, formerly under Shanghai County, still belonged to Shanghai County when the city and county were divided before the Incident. Since the National Government returned to the capital, it has been re-administered by the urban area. Because it is located on the banks of the Huangpu River and occupies a geographically advantageous position, transportation is very convenient and commerce is quite developed. There are currently about 250 shops in the entire town, mostly selling grains and miscellaneous grains, followed by daily necessities. The town has a chamber of commerce, which is the leading organization for merchants. The current president is Zhang Jingzhen, who is enthusiastic about public welfare. The town also has a branch of the China Cooperative Society in Shenjiang County, which handles distribution on a regular basis. There are currently about 2,000 members, and branches have been established in nearby towns and villages. In terms of industry, the most notable is the opening of the Chengzheng Yarn Factory, which works day and night to speed up production and employs more than 40 female workers, producing about one piece of yarn per day. In terms of small industries, there are several agents for the match manufacturing plant. In terms of finance, the Shanghai Fuxing Bank and Hexin Trust Company have both opened offices after Guanghua. The Heying Bank Minhang Branch and Tongye Trading Company have also been established one after another. All merchants and residents in the town have contact with the financial industry and have received a lot of help.

Party and Government General

The Shenjiang County Government is located north of Minhang Town. The current county magistrate is Li Guangyuan. The Standing Committee of the Shenjiang County District Party Department is Chen Geng, the Executive Committee members are Dong Jingliang, Xu Pengcheng, Zhao Shizhang, and Lu Huisheng, the Supervisory Committee member is Zhang Jingzhen, the District Head of the First District Office is Gu Fengxiang, the Town Mayor is Dai Zuping, the Director of the Shenjiang County Property Management Office is Zhu Zhongxian, and the Director of the Land Tax Collection Office is Cheng Shizhi. Various county-level agencies are concentrated in Minhang, so Minhang has become the political center of Shenjiang County. Party and government circles have a spirit of cooperation, which is very gratifying for Minhang, which is in the process of revival.

Public Security Situation

The population of Minhang Town, according to the First District Office's re-census last winter, totals 18 wards, 186 units, and 1,752 households, with 4,356 men and 3,606 women, for a total of 7,962 people. However, recently, due to the evacuation of the population from Shanghai and the unrest in the surrounding areas, many people have moved to the town. As a result, the town's population has surged, housing has become scarce, and rent has also risen. A small room costs at least 1,000 gold to rent, and it is still difficult to find one. In terms of public security, in addition to the Allied garrison, there is the county security team and the police bureau, with considerable strength. The captain of the county security team is Tao Xuesheng, and the police chief is Qian Shengtang. They pay constant attention to the town's public security, so the townspeople are able to live in peace.

Education and Hygiene

Before the Incident, education in Minhang was known for its development, with middle schools, normal schools, central primary schools, simplified primary schools, and Kuangci Orphanage. After the Incident, through the planning of local people, the education business is also reviving. Currently, there is one Shenjiang County Junior High School in the town, with Lin Qing as the principal, about five or six teachers, and about seventy or eighty students. There is one Shenjiang County Minhang Primary School, with Xia Youyi as the principal, about twelve or thirteen teachers, and about eight or nine hundred students. Although the professors are very serious, they have not been able to develop greatly due to financial difficulties. Fortunately, the principals are enthusiastic about serving, and the merchants and residents of the town also understand the righteousness and provide assistance from time to time, so they are still able to continue teaching. In order to benefit the deaf and mute, the county government is running a deaf and mute school in the Ning Sigong Hall in the north of the town, which is scheduled to open on August 25. In terms of hygiene, there is only one public dispensary, while there are more than a dozen private doctors of internal medicine and surgery. However, because medicine is expensive, middle and lower-class families are afraid to get sick. If residents die, those who cannot afford it will be assisted by the Puan Charity Hall to arrange for burial. The hall is charitable in nature, with Xia Youyi as the chairman of the board, and Li Jiren and others in charge. The hall has a public cemetery called "Puan Cemetery," which is only half a mile from the town and has beautiful scenery. Many people go there to pay their respects during the Tomb Sweeping Festival. Long-distance buses run four or five times a day. At the same time, there are private cars operating. The fare for China Auto is 5,000 yuan for a one-way trip, and 4,400 yuan for a one-way trip by car. Leaving from Xietu Road, it takes a little over an hour to arrive. In addition, trucks from Weida and Fulin Transportation Companies, peddlers selling rice, and rickshaws carrying passengers on short trips travel on the Shanghai-Minhang Road, one after another. In terms of waterway transport, there are Shanghai-Minhang, Ping-Hu, and Song-Hu liners from the Inner River Transport Company, which operate daily or every other day. Because the fares are slightly lower, they are very crowded. (The Shanghai-Minhang boat ticket is 2,000 yuan per person.) Other rowboats that travel to and from Nanqiao, Tang, Zhuanghang, and other places, and boats that travel back and forth in the Huangpu River, day and night, are a constant stream, so transportation can be described as "absolutely convenient," which is beneficial to the prosperity of Minhang Town's business. However, prices are soaring endlessly. Middle and upper-class families can maintain, while others are constantly complaining. Currently, the price of rice in Minhang Town is about 150,000 yuan per stone, fish and meat are about 1,200 yuan per catty, goose eggs are more than 100 yuan each, tofu is 50 yuan per square, and fritters and fried dough sticks have increased to 100 yuan each. If prices cannot be suppressed in the future, the lives of the common people will be hopeless. The opium addicts and white flour users in the ignorant town are also more aware of the authorities than before the war. Then, Minhang's future may be promising. (Rewards Scholarship Donation)

### The Date of the Three-Headed Conference is Unclear

Stockholm, Sweden, 4th (Central News Agency dispatch) - According to a diplomatic interviewer from Reuters. The exact date of the Three-Headed Conference to be held in the Bozitan district near Berlin is still a matter between the three major countries of England, the United States and the Soviet Union. Yesterday, the official radio station issued a message that the date of the meeting has been set for next Tuesday, but this kind of information that has not been confirmed by the authorities cannot be published. At the same time, according to well-informed sources in London, the conference will probably be held after next Tuesday. In addition, President Truman's personal press reporter Ross made a statement in Washington, saying, "There is no record of the exact date of the meeting, and the meeting dates rumored in various sources are also unreliable."

### French Authorities Confiscate Weygand's Property

Zurich, 4th (Central News Agency dispatch) - According to a report from Paris: The French High Court issued an order on the 3rd to confiscate the property of Marshal Weygand. Marshal Weygand succeeded Marshal Darlan in 1940, when France collapsed, as commander of the French army and supreme commander of the Allied forces.

### Anglo-American Troops Enter Berlin, Troop Transfer to be Completed Within Days

Stockholm, 4th (Central News Agency): According to a British correspondent's report from Berlin last night: Within 24 hours, British troops, led by the 7th Armored Division, will enter Berlin from Brunswick. Simultaneously, yesterday morning, 4,000 American tanks and 16,000 armed troops advanced along the main roads to Berlin, with their vanguard already inside the city. Following them is the U.S. 2nd Armored Division, commanded by General Hugh Gaffey, which has fought in Africa, Sicily, France, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Germany. This unit will be the first to enter Berlin and secure the American occupation zone. This troop transfer began at dawn yesterday, with American units advancing eastward from the Halle area along the main thoroughfare towards Berlin. At the same time, Soviet forces will also be transferring a large portion of their troops to the area previously held by American forces. This troop movement is expected to be completed within two or three weeks.

Central News Agency: According to TASS, Berlin: Anglo-American troops began withdrawing from the Soviet occupation zone in Germany on July 1st. Soviet troops immediately followed, moving into Seehausen, Halle, Lauchstädt, Anhalt and Löbnitz.

### Tragic State of the German People

Manzhouli, 4th (Central News Agency): According to information received here, in the past two months, the administrative trend of the American and British occupation zones in Germany has intensified pressure, attempting to eliminate the German nation. Today, the German people have become a second Jewish nation, without a country or land, and even their right to survival is not guaranteed. It is truly a tragedy of the century. The German Occupation Zone Management Committee divided Berlin into four occupation zones. Subsequently, the British and Americans forcibly requisitioned labor within these zones. Those workers who had not registered with the labor administration were not allocated food rations. Rumors circulated that elderly people, both male and female, and young children who were unable to work were starving to death due to the lack of food rations. Skilled laborers were formed into groups and forced to engage in civil engineering projects or coal mining, with extended working hours, in an effort to exploit Germany's underground resources. The food ration distribution depended entirely on Germany's remaining stockpiles, leading to widespread starvation in areas where food was scarce. The goal of the various countries in oppressing Germany is that even if Germany establishes a new government, it will not be able to compensate for the losses suffered by the various countries during the war. Therefore, it is necessary to utilize Germany's labor force to the maximum extent possible as compensation and to seize Germany's resources in the short term, rendering a resource-depleted Germany incapable of waging war again, thus eliminating Germany and its people. As a result, Germany is under the control, oppression, and plunder of various countries, with the vitality of the nation completely drained. It is predicted that this winter, millions of people will become prisoners within Germany.

### Hopkins Suddenly Resigns, British and Soviet Political Circles Express Concern

Lisbon, 4th (Central News Agency): According to a report from Washington: Harry Hopkins, who served as President Truman's special envoy to prepare for the Three-Power Conference in Moscow, formally announced his departure from American political affairs on the 3rd. Although his reason for resigning was his poor health, according to well-informed sources, Hopkins' talks with Chairman Stalin resulted in a conflict of views with Truman. Whether he voluntarily resigned from the government or was dismissed by Truman remains unknown. As a close confidant of Roosevelt, Hopkins was responsible for overseeing the Lend-Lease program and later assumed the task of coordinating relations between Britain and the Soviet Union, following Roosevelt's foreign policy, particularly advocating a friendly policy towards the Soviet Union. Following the replacement of Secretary of State Stettinius, Hopkins' resignation truly demonstrates Truman's intention to eliminate the Roosevelt era influence within the government. Furthermore, both Hopkins and Stettinius identified themselves as members of the "European faction." From this perspective, it can be seen that the US government's European policy, particularly its policy towards the Soviet Union, has fundamentally changed. The impact on domestic public opinion is self-evident, and British and Soviet political circles are also extremely concerned.

### Yugoslavia Suffers Major Damage

Central News Agency: According to TASS, Belgrade: A summary of the damages suffered by Yugoslavia during the German occupation reveals that approximately 350,000 farms were destroyed, the number of livestock decreased by 50 percent, 15 million fruit trees and over 40,000 hectares of farmland were damaged. In the Ub region, over 70,000 public and private houses were destroyed, and the cities of Petrovac na Mlavi and Andrijevica have been completely reduced to ruins. 25 percent of the country's industry has been completely shut down. The German army destroyed and took away a large number of locomotives and rails, and destroyed a great number of railway bridges and stations. The number of civilian losses amounted to 1,685,000, and the number of soldiers lost amounted to 283,540.

### U.S. Troops in Europe Return Home in Batches

Lisbon, 4th (Central News Agency): According to a report from Paris: The European Theater of Operations Transportation Command announced on the 1st that since the end of the European war up until now, more than 310,000 American soldiers have returned home, and another 265,000 are preparing to return home in mid-July.

### Domestic Briefs

Nanjing, 4th (Central News Agency): General Chen Cheng, Commander of the Central Gendarmerie Headquarters, recently visited Hangzhou and the Nanjing-Shanghai line, including Wuxi, Changzhou, Suzhou, and Zhenjiang, to inspect gendarmerie affairs in the areas under his jurisdiction. He has now completed his duties and returned to the capital on the 4th.

Ren Yuandao, a Central Committee member, was dispatched by the Central Government to preside over the oath-taking ceremony. The ceremony was solemn.

### Preface to the Draft Gazetteer of Jiangsu Province by Ren Yuandao

The compilation of the Gazetteer of Jiangsu has been underway for over thirty years. Despite numerous changes, it has fortunately not been lost. After assuming the position of governor, I desired to prioritize its publication for wider dissemination, naming it the Draft Gazetteer of Jiangsu to indicate that it is distinct from the final version. The book is scheduled to be entirely printed by the end of October this year. The preface by Ren is recorded below:

The compilation of the Jiangsu Gazetteer, from its inception to the present, spans more than thirty years. Those who oversaw the process included numerous esteemed scholars such as Miao Xiaoshan, Feng Menghua, Zhuang Sijian, and Wu Xiangzhi. They categorized and organized the information, meticulously detailing each item, each expressing their own insights. However, due to the changes in the world and the constraints of human affairs, the elders Miao, Feng, and Zhuang passed away successively, or were unable to fully complete the work of thorough research, description, and revision. Nevertheless, their drafts filled the shelves, requiring immense effort day and night, almost impossible to achieve quickly. It is truly a monumental undertaking.

Since the Ding You incident, there have been attempts to avoid danger. It was repeatedly moved, eventually transported to Wu, and a conservation committee was established to protect it. Not forgetting the preservation of local documents, a responsibility that is especially important. Even with various responsibilities competing for attention, my heart has always been with this book. Whenever I have time after official duties, I peruse what I can. I realize that there is still much that needs to be supplemented, revised, and polished by future scholars. However, if we do not plan to publish it now to broaden its circulation, and it is lost, the efforts will be abandoned. Would that not be a great pity? Even without the encouragement of local residents, I must fulfill my duty and complete this wish. Therefore, I entrusted the gentlemen of the association to arrange and organize the materials, continue the printing process, and observe its completion, calling it the Draft Gazetteer of Jiangsu Province, to indicate that it is not the final version. As for further refinement and improvement through collective wisdom and effort, that is something to look forward to in a peaceful era, and to expect from those who take on this responsibility in the future.

### Consultative Committee Discusses Actively Relocating Vagrants, Decides to Implement Five Relocation Measures

The city is overrun with vagrants. At a time when both food and resources are scarce, it is necessary to thoroughly relocate these vagrants who only consume and do not produce. All parties are paying close attention to this issue, and public opinion is unanimously advocating for prompt implementation. The Municipal Consultative Committee is particularly concerned and therefore raised the issue for discussion at yesterday's routine meeting of the standing committee. Relevant authorities were invited to participate in the discussions, including Deputy Bureau Chiefs Du Manliang, Section Chiefs Sugihara and Li from the Police Bureau, Bureau Chief Zhou from the Social Welfare Bureau, and Bureau Chief Su from the Qingxiang Affairs Bureau. Consultative committee members Li Sihao, Lin Kanghou, Shen Siliang, Zhao Jinqing, Xiang Kangyuan, Chen Riping, Chen Binhe, and others, all agreed that the city is overrun with vagrants, which is not only detrimental to the appearance of the city but also leads to young and strong individuals engaging in robberies and cunning individuals stealing and damaging public facilities, disrupting public order. These individuals loiter in the streets, urinating and defecating everywhere, spreading disease, and harming public health. Moreover, they are idle and do not engage in production, increasing the burden on law-abiding citizens. At a time when food and resources are scarce, providing for vagrants is a waste. Based on the above points, it is necessary to promptly concentrate and relocate vagrants in this city. After discussion, the following measures were decided:

Measures for Relocating Vagrants

The concentration of vagrants and implementation of relocation will be managed by the Vagrant Labor Camp, with the assistance of the Police Bureau for concentration, and the Relocation Association for relocation. Select desolate areas suitable for cultivation or with conditions for handicraft production as relocation destinations, such as Hengsha Island in Pudong, which is suitable for cultivation, and Shenjiang County, which is suitable for early childhood education. After relocation, the young and strong will be subjected to strict discipline to guide their character towards the right path and engage in cultivation and production. Young children will receive compulsory elementary education, women and children will learn handicrafts, and the elderly will be sheltered. The concentration and relocation are scheduled to be completed within two months. The relocated vagrants will include men, women, the elderly, and children, and will be implemented in batches. The first batch is tentatively set at 2,000 people, starting with the complete removal of homeless children from the streets.

Now that the relocation of vagrants has been discussed and decided by the Consultative Committee, it can be submitted to the government for prompt implementation. It is hoped that all sectors of society will cooperate and that indiscriminate almsgiving, which fosters dependency habits, should be stopped. Instead, the money prepared for alms should be concentrated and donated to support the relocation of vagrants.

Active Promotion of Vagrant Concentration

It is also learned that the Municipal Vagrant Labor Camp has been established for one year. Camp Director Chen Dongbai recently submitted his resignation to the board of directors, who appointed Standing Director Chen Binhe as interim director. The handover procedures were completed at the end of last month. From June 11th to July 3rd, with the assistance of the Police Bureau, the camp has already taken in over 1,000 vagrants, including 200 children, who have been sent to the Vagrant Work-Study Institute for care.

### Various Organizations Subscribe to Coarse Grains, Payment Begins Today

The Civil Food Adjustment Committee established by the Municipal Consultative Committee recently decided on the first phase of coarse grain procurement. Participating units are scheduled to make payments to Fuxing Bank starting today. The details of the first phase of coarse grain procurement are as follows:

A fund of 100 million yuan will be divided into 10,000 units, with each unit being 500,000 yuan. Half will be subscribed to by various private organizations and institutions, and half will be provided by the municipal government as general allocation.

All industrial and commercial sectors (factories and stores), schools, cultural and medical institutions, and other organizations may participate independently. A group of 20 people can subscribe to one unit, and any institution or organization is limited to subscribing to 20 units.

The coarse grains will primarily consist of flour and wheat, and other various coarse grains will be equally distributed by the committee.

The procurement period is approximately one and a half months, but the coarse grains will be distributed as soon as they arrive, in order of payment.

The payment period is from July 5th to July 12th. Payments will not be accepted after the deadline.

Payments should be made to Fuxing Bank and its branches in the city, and coarse grains should be collected at the Bureau of Economic Affairs.

The date for collecting coarse grains will be publicly announced in the newspapers.

The price of coarse grains and transportation costs will be shared equally by the participating institutions and organizations. At the end of the first phase of procurement, all accounts will be publicly reported by the committee.

This time, the coarse grain procurement method is slightly different from the previously implemented low-price rice, for example: Previously, participating organizations and industrial and commercial sectors were targeted through trade associations. This time, the industrial and commercial sectors will participate independently and directly, without going through trade associations. Bank drafts can also be used for payments. All of this is intended to facilitate the participation of organizations and to regulate the people's food supply. It is hoped that all sectors of society will pay attention.

### Bureau of Finance Investigates Illegal Collection of House Tax

When the Municipal Bureau of Finance collects house tax every quarter, the tax collectors first distribute notices to the households in each area and set a deadline for payment. If merchants and residents have a house tax notice, they can directly pay the tax amount to the House and Land Tax Section of the Finance Bureau on Hankou Road. The bureau will stamp the notice with "Tax Received" and the collector will sign and stamp it, which will serve as an official receipt. If tax collectors are sent to collect house tax, they must use official receipts and the collector must sign and stamp it to be valid. The use of blank receipts to collect tax from merchants and residents is strictly prohibited. In the future, if any incidents of collecting house tax with blank receipts occur, citizens can immediately send the offender to the nearest police station or directly report to the bureau. The personnel of the bureau collecting house tax all wear the bureau's badge and carry a formal identification card with their photo attached. When paying house tax, merchants and residents must pay attention to their credentials.

### All Sectors of the City Initiate Memorial Donations for Madam Zhou's Mother to Help Charity

The esteemed mother of Zhou Fohai, Vice President of the Executive Yuan and Mayor of Shanghai, recently passed away in Chongqing. Zhou lost his father at a young age and relied on his mother to raise him to fame. In recent years, he has been working on national affairs in different places. Now that his mother has suddenly passed away, separated by mountains and rivers, Zhou's filial piety is extraordinary. Because he could not welcome her to live with him and personally serve her during her lifetime, and after her death, he could not rush to mourn and witness the encoffining, nor could he grieve by the coffin, his grief is beyond measure. Leading figures from all sectors of the city, to commemorate Madam Ma's virtues, have initiated memorial donations to help charity. Zhou has agreed that memorial donations from relatives and friends, except for elegiac couplets, will be converted into cash for items such as wreaths, and all will be allocated to charity. Memorial donation cash will be entrusted to Fuxing Bank and its branches in the city for collection, and the names will be published in this newspaper.

### Those Who Obstruct Rice Transport Should be Severely Punished

— Li Chun

After reading the newspaper's editorial "Reasonably Resolve the Food Problem," I deeply feel that it speaks without holding back, saying everything it can. I now briefly record what I have heard and seen on the Shanghai-Hangzhou railway line for your reference:

When the train arrives at Jiashan, rice merchants gather to load the train. According to an old transporter, he can carry five dou of rice. From the place of origin, he takes the train to Shanghai. The initial price was 50,000 to 60,000 yuan per shi, gradually rising to 500,000 yuan. When Zhang Zhirui was in office at 200,000 yuan, the price of rice in Shanghai was above 500,000 yuan. At that time, Jiashan restricted transportation, and every day they tried their best to transport goods once, which could yield a profit of about 200,000 yuan. Since the Changju implemented the emergency donation, the price of rice in Shanghai has eased, and the price of rice in the mainland has risen to 500,000 yuan. Transporting it to Shanghai can yield a profit of 50,000 to 60,000 yuan each time, while the local expenses and train tickets cost more than 30,000 yuan. Therefore, currently, there is no profit, and the number of small vendors has decreased. Fortunately, after arriving in Shanghai, the rice money is sold for cash, and exchange slips are used to purchase gold jewelry and other items to be sold back to Jiashan, which can yield a profit of about 100,000 yuan on the exchange difference. They seem to think that it is very hard.

Judging from the above, it seems that suppressing the rice price should be the urgent task. After carefully considering the words of the transporters, there are still many obstacles. In my humble opinion, the Changju should try to set a price limit. For example, if the price of rice is set at 200,000 yuan per shi, all food and daily necessities should also be reduced by three-quarters of the price and sold fairly. This is a fundamental solution that does not harm farmers or the people. If there are any corrupt officials who feign compliance or obstruct transportation, they should be executed on the spot. Although it is a chaotic world, it is easy to achieve results. Otherwise, if the situation is allowed to drag on, the consequences will be unimaginable.

### Revised Implementation Measures of Outline for Strengthening Financial Operations and Regulations on Limiting the Issuance of Promissory Notes

The Central Reserve Bank, the Bankers' Association, and the Qianzhun Ku (Money Firm Reserve) have, starting from the 3rd of this month, canceled the practice of the Central Reserve Bank Clearing House and the joint reserve of the Banking and Money industries. On the same day (i.e., the 3rd), all banks will uniformly follow the regulations of the Central Reserve Bank to issue parallel money promissory notes to pay customers, and they may pay cash depending on the amount of the depositor's deposit. The Ministry of Finance authorities recently announced the revision and supplementation of four articles of the Outline for Strengthening Financial Institutions. It is learned that the Financial Affairs Inspection Office of the Central Reserve Bank has now submitted to the Ministry of Finance for approval the revision and addition of four articles to the Implementation Measures of the Strengthening Outline. Regulations on limiting the issuance of immediate promissory notes by various banks and Zhuang (money shops) and regulations on financial institutions paying cash to depositors have also been stipulated and ordered to be followed. The details are as follows:

Addition of Four Articles to the Implementation Measures

The Central Reserve Bank Inspection Office has submitted to the Ministry of Finance for approval the addition of four articles to the Implementation Measures of the Outline for Strengthening Financial Institutions, as follows: Article 13: Funds of financial institutions deposited with other financial institutions outside of the regulations of this outline shall be fully cleared after the promulgation of the amended articles of this outline, and transferred to the Central Reserve Bank Joint Reserve and the Qianye Zhunbei Ku respectively. If a financial institution has unavoidable circumstances and must deposit funds with other financial institutions outside of the regulations of this outline, it shall fill out the "Application for Deposit with Other Financial Institutions" form prescribed by the Financial Affairs Inspection Office of the Central Reserve Bank and request special approval before proceeding. Article 14: When a financial institution lends funds to other financial institutions, it shall immediately fill out the "Report Form for Lending and Borrowing Funds" prescribed by the Financial Affairs Inspection Office of the Central Reserve Bank with the detailed contents of the lending and submit it to the Financial Affairs Inspection Office of the Central Reserve Bank for registration and filing. The same applies when borrowing from other financial institutions. The above report form shall be delivered on the same day as the lending and borrowing, without delay. Article 15: Funds borrowed by financial institutions from other financial institutions, the short-term funds borrowed in the form of firewood, shall be transferred to the "Interbank Lending" account at any time. Long-term funds borrowed with a loan agreement shall be transferred to the "Borrowed Interbank Funds" account at any time, and shall not be transferred via the "Interbank Deposit" or other accounts. Article 16: Financial institutions shall not use the checks deposited on the current day to offset the deposits payable based on the previous day's balance.

Regulations on Limiting the Issuance of Promissory Notes

The following regulations on limiting the issuance of immediate promissory notes by various financial institutions are submitted by the Central Reserve Bank to the Ministry of Finance for promulgation and implementation: Banks may issue immediate promissory notes for the purpose of paying deposits, but not for other loans, deposits with other financial institutions, and various expenses. The total amount of immediate promissory notes issued by banks shall be limited to the total amount of deposits. Banks shall transfer the account for immediate promissory notes at any time. Banks shall cancel immediate promissory notes upon collection, and shall not use collected or unissued promissory notes as cash. Banks shall prepare a detailed statement of immediate promissory notes issued at the end of each business day and submit it to the Financial Affairs Inspection Office of the Central Reserve Bank for verification. If a bank violates the above regulations, its business may be suspended, and in serious cases, its license may be revoked.

Key Points for Paying Cash to Depositors

The Financial Affairs Inspection Office of the Central Reserve Bank issued a circular yesterday (the 4th) to various financial institutions to stipulate the method for banks and Zhuang (money shops) to pay cash, stating: "It has been stipulated by this factory that when various financial institutions pay cash to depositors, they should pay 20% of the average monthly withdrawal of the depositor within one week. Payment will be made once a week, but the maximum amount per household shall not exceed one million yuan. When depositors withdraw cash, they should have funds available for the following day, and checks for routine business shall not be cashed."

### Social Services: Garbage Piles Up Like Mountains, Endangering Public Health - Hoping Authorities Will Act Quickly

Recently, this office has received letters from readers expressing dissatisfaction with the accumulation of garbage in various parts of the city. Since this matter concerns public health, the authorities should pay attention to improving it. We have selected one of the letters for publication: (Omitted above) With the arrival of summer, hygiene problems are extremely important. However, since previously "starting," most of the garbage in the city has no longer been transported to the suburbs for disposal, but is conveniently piled up in densely populated urban streets. For example, in Binpu in Nanshi, from Xiaodongmen to Minguo Road in the old Eighth District, and from the Yitaixing Coal Wharf to Kangnao Road in the old First District, from Shandong Road Wharf to Ningbo Road, from Wenzhou Road Wharf to Datong Road, from Fujian Road Wharf to Beijing Road, and along the north bank of the Suzhou Creek, all are accumulated like hills, with foul odors spreading everywhere, flies breeding, pedestrians covering their noses, and residents wrinkling their brows. The rampant epidemics in summer and autumn are even more worrying. The reason is that the contractors for garbage transportation are greedy for profit, reduce labor and food, and are unwilling to load all the ships with garbage, piling it up along the road to get the job done. The lower-level administrative staff are mostly influenced by them, deceiving their superiors without investigation. But if this continues, the garbage will accumulate more and more, and Shanghai will become a garbage world. The sanitation authorities do not understand the truth and have repeatedly stated their intention to value summer sanitation. The Great Sanitation Movement was held from the 25th of last month. The rhetoric and the reality are completely opposite, which is truly regrettable. (Yueding)
