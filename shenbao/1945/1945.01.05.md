### Important Declaration by Japanese Prime Minister at Cabinet Meeting, Hoping for National Uprising to Increase War Power

Tokyo, 4th (Central News Agency) – Japanese Prime Minister Koiso made an important declaration at the Cabinet meeting on the 4th, reiterating the significance of the Battle of Leyte shifting to the Battle of Luzon, hoping for an uprising in the rear areas, the government's administrative operations to be geared for decisive battle, and strongly stating that this year is the year for decisive victory. He also requested the cooperation of all cabinet members. The content is as follows: We must complete the victory in the decisive battle this year, but the war situation is extremely serious. Although we have achieved unprecedented victories in the seas off Taiwan and the Philippines, the damage to our navy is also not small. Subsequently, our army and navy jointly used special attack forces to intercept and kill enemy troops. The battle situation in Leyte is not absolutely favorable. Now the decisive battle in Leyte has shifted to a decisive battle in the entire Philippines. Especially in view of the European war situation, the enemy may intend to compensate for their disadvantages in Europe through the Pacific theater. At this time, the people in our rear areas must rise up and increase our war power to assist the fierce fighting on the front lines. The government must also seek the concrete realization of strong politics and the gearing of administrative operations for decisive battle, etc., and move forward with great determination, hoping for cooperation in assisting the perfect handling of this situation.

### Fires and Extinguishment in Nagoya and Other Places

Tokyo, 4th (Central News Agency) – When enemy aircraft attacked the Japanese mainland on the 3rd, they dropped several incendiary bombs over Osaka, but due to the active civil air defense system, there was little damage. Enemy aircraft also dropped incendiary bombs in the Hamamatsu area, and several fires broke out in the urban areas, but they were quickly extinguished. In the Nagoya area, enemy aircraft attacked repeatedly seven or eight times in multiple formations, dropping incendiary bombs and bombs mixed together in urban areas. Some fires occurred, causing some damage, but the important facilities and factories in the above three cities were almost completely undamaged. The enemy's tactics of blindly bombing urban areas with incendiary bombs clearly aims to shake Japanese morale.

### Large Enemy Carrier-Based Aircraft Attack Taiwan and Okinawa, Promptly Intercepted and 25 Shot Down and Destroyed

Tokyo, 4th (Central News Agency) – The Imperial General Headquarters announced at 4:00 PM on the 4th: (1) From approximately 7:40 AM to 2:30 PM on January 3rd, approximately 500 enemy aircraft, mainly carrier-based, repeatedly attacked the Taiwan and Okinawa areas. (2) The results confirmed so far are as follows: 17 enemy aircraft shot down, 8 damaged. Japanese losses were minor.

Tokyo, 4th (Central News Agency) – The enemy's powerful U.S. mobile force approached the coastal waters of Taiwan and Okinawa on the 3rd. From 7:40 AM to 3:30 PM, 500 aircraft attacked Taiwan and Okinawa. The Japanese air defense forces immediately intercepted them. The battle results confirmed so far are that 17 aircraft were shot down, and 8 were destroyed, for a total of 25. This time, the enemy army mainly used carrier-based aircraft, and about 40 B-29s were dispatched from mainland bases to participate in the battle, attacking various parts of the entire island of Taiwan with their main force. There was almost no damage to Okinawa. The damage to Taiwan was also very minor. After the Fifth Eighth Mobile Force suffered a disastrous defeat, this time it forcibly attacked again with a mobile force. Its purpose is nothing more than to contain the Philippine campaign and cut off the Japanese air force's supply to the Philippines. The Philippine war is gradually trending towards a complex and huge long-term war of attrition because the Japanese army and navy are fighting to the death. At a time when the German army's counteroffensive in the Ardennes in Western Europe is unfolding in a new direction, the enemy is forcibly launching continuous attacks, and the anxiety to quickly resolve the Philippine campaign is intensifying. The enemy's mobile force was dispatched this time, also a manifestation of the enemy's idea of a short-term decisive battle. After the enemy's mobile force attacked on the 3rd, it continued to cruise in the waters near Taiwan, and at the same time as the air raid on Taiwan, an enemy mobile force accompanying a transport convoy invaded the Sulu Sea, appearing to be attempting a new landing. In short, the Philippine campaign is developing in an extremely subtle direction.

### Fierce Battles Continue in the Bastogne Area, American Troops in the Rhine Fall into a Passive Position

Berlin, 4th (Central News Agency) – The German Supreme Headquarters issued a West Front report at noon on the 3rd: The fighting in the vast area of ​​Bastogne is still fierce. The two armies are now engaged in a major battle with advances and retreats. The American army used approximately four divisions each of tanks and infantry to crush the German front west of Bastogne and attempted to encircle the German positions east and southeast of the city from three sides, but lost more than one hundred tanks and only gained a few areas. According to recent reports, the American army has lost 400 artillery pieces, 2,230 tanks and armored vehicles, and 24,000 prisoners in this winter battle. American casualties are about to exceed 50,000. The fighting on the Saar front and eastern Lorraine is still proceeding smoothly. The Saar bridgehead northwest of Forbach has been further expanded. The German army is clearing anti-Axis forces in the northeastern border area of ​​Saargemünd and launching attacks in the lower reaches of the Vosges River, all of which are proceeding smoothly at the same time.

Lisbon, 4th (Central News Agency) – According to a dispatch from Paris, a communiqué issued by Eisenhower's headquarters on the 3rd has acknowledged that the activity of the German army in the Saar Valley is extremely fierce. Furthermore, the German army has launched an offensive southeast of Saarlautern and has crossed the Blies River northeast of Saargemünd. The German army on the southern flank of the western front has particularly strengthened its forces in the Dieppe region, the focus of the offensive. German troops with tank units near the southeast of Bitsch have forced the anti-Axis forces to retreat. The German army has also completed intrusion battles in several locations in the northern Vosges Mountains. At the same time, the American Seventh Army from that area to the Rhine has completely fallen into a passive position.

Many Red Army soldiers were captured in that area. On the western front of Budapest, house-to-house battles took place all day long. In the past three days, 97 Soviet tanks and 21 artillery pieces were destroyed.

### German Embassy Military Attaché Speaks on Recent Combat Situation: Unwavering Belief in Victory

Enemy Offensives

Mostly Halted

(Continued from yesterday) It is abundantly clear in all sectors that the enemy intends to prepare a massive offensive on the Western Front to enter Germany and wage a decisive war. This may even involve a simultaneous pincer attack with Russian forces. The enemy's focus on bridgeheads in front of Visemburg, the Saar, and Aachen further underscores this objective. In these areas, considerable fresh troops and large quantities of ammunition are being prepared for use in their mission. Given this situation, German forces launched an offensive in the Monschau-Echternach area with three interrelated objectives: (1) to defeat the U.S. First Army in the area, which was achieved on December 26th; (2) to alleviate the difficulties faced by German forces on the Western Front and to tie down their reserves; and (3) to continue depleting enemy manpower and resources. German forces, employing substantial troop strength and armored divisions, launched an offensive across a front exceeding two hundred *li*, delivering a significant blow to American lines with a blitzkrieg-style attack. Subsequently, they rapidly advanced westward, with other German forces advancing simultaneously to reinforce the attacking units, suppress enemy resistance, and protect the German flanks. After six days of combat, the total number of prisoners reached 26,000. It is worth noting that casualties and injuries often exceed the number of prisoners by several times, highlighting the immense losses suffered by the enemy.

Following the defeat of the U.S. First Army, enemy resistance suddenly weakened. On December 26th, news of the U.S. First Army's rout became known. The German offensive on the Western Front came as a complete surprise to the enemy, who were utterly unprepared. All enemy reserve units were positioned elsewhere, intended for a future offensive against German forces. This sudden German attack significantly disrupted the enemy's objectives and military plans. The German preparations eased the overall situation, and the majority of the enemy's offensives were immediately halted. During the continued German attacks, many areas were recaptured, especially the enemy's bridgeheads in the Saar region. These bridgeheads, originally intended for a decisive offensive, had to be abandoned, resulting in the loss of valuable equipment that will be difficult to replace. Because the enemy required reinforcements to counter the German offensive, and these were not readily available, they were forced to resort to temporary measures, deploying rear echelon (military service units) troops to the front lines. However, these were mostly deployed after German forces had already breached the lines. The enemy's actual reserves, originally stationed elsewhere, were then mobilized and transported rapidly using rail and mechanized transport. Consequently, the enemy's logistical transport became extremely chaotic, as all the tools for transporting troops and ammunition were required at their planned attack locations. At the same time, the German Air Force attacked and disrupted these temporary measures. Therefore, regardless of how far the German offensive progresses westward or how many areas are occupied, it has already achieved its objectives as of today.

New Weaponry

Extremely Powerful

By fighting to gain time, the German High Command has secured new victories. The enemy will require a long time to deploy new troops, new weapons, and new materials and ammunition to replenish the losses incurred during this German offensive. During this period, German war industries can certainly take advantage of the time. Likewise, military training and the construction of defensive fortifications can proceed with full effort. Due to military considerations, detailed reports on the German offensive on the Western Front and all its new weaponry have not been available, especially regarding the structure of extremely powerful new weapons, such as the V-weapons. However, what is currently known is that the V-2 is a ten-meter-long rocket, shaped like a bomb, with a diameter of one meter and a weight of fifteen tons. It is propelled by a rotating system, reaching a speed of 5,000 meters per hour (faster than the speed of sound), and an altitude of over 200 *li* (flying in a vacuum). Upon impact, it detonates, using a state-of-the-art explosive with immense destructive power. Furthermore, considering that a recent target in northern England was also hit, its long range is evident. Its accuracy allows it to be used directly against front-line units. To combat enemy tank units, German forces have equipped themselves with a new, highly effective artillery piece, capable of destroying even the newest and heaviest tanks used by the enemy on the European battlefield. Consequently, within the first twelve days of the German offensive, 870 enemy tanks were destroyed. After a period of relative inactivity, the German Air Force, which the enemy believed had gained control of Western European airspace, reported shooting down 117 enemy aircraft on December 24th, 83 aircraft on December 25th in adverse weather conditions, and 62 aircraft on December 27th.

Food and Fuel

Are Ample

Regarding Germany's food and fuel production, which enemy propaganda claims to be insufficient, Captain Harminch of the German Army, newly arrived in China from Germany, has provided our people with detailed explanations. Recent reports from Germany also confirm that the food required for the sixth year of the war, particularly fats and oils, is ample and not a cause for concern. Furthermore, thanks to the sound organization of food administration, the black market is prevented from developing, and prices are not allowed to rise. Therefore, every German citizen can still obtain their personal needs at a fair price, as they did before the war. During the recent Christmas holiday, each person even received special rations of butter, flour, and alcohol. The production of synthetic gasoline has been greatly improved and expanded. For air defense purposes, all factories are distributed across the country, some even underground, and supply remains uninterrupted to this day. The exact level of production can be estimated by the extensive use of armored and mechanized units in the current German counter-offensive on the Western Front, given the enormous quantities of gasoline used, not including the gasoline used by aircraft supporting the offensive. Due to the war, Germany's policy of self-sufficiency in this area has made significant progress. In short, the German command is definitely in a proactive position on the Western Front.

Eastern and Southern Fronts

Combat Situation

In Italy, the enemy is using a large number of troops, and has only made very small territorial gains, and is not worthy of special attention. There is only local warfare in the Balkan theatre, and the war with Tito's guerrillas is serious, especially in Montenegro, where Belgrade is currently active. On the Eastern Front there are two hard fought battles:

(1) In the Budapest sector, the Russian army has attacked repeatedly for several weeks, gaining only a small area. It is now attacking Buda west to north to encircle Budapest, while also taking an offensive on the west side of the city. The German army fought successfully in the north of Dorau and the southern border of Slovakia. The Russian army at any point can not get greater land, and always suffer heavy losses, especially the loss of tanks.

(2) The enemy's offensive in Gilan aims to destroy the guards who have been holding out there and advance to the East China Sea. So far, the German side has not suffered much loss, and has been repulsed by German counter-attacks from time to time. The enemy also suffered significant losses of tanks and aircraft at this place. This is the result of the use of new German weapons.

In summary, in today's European war situation, the enemy has failed to achieve the purpose of a decisive war anywhere. The German war situation is very stable, and the resistance is increasing day by day. The enemy's original plan to end the war this winter has been completely shattered. The recent German offensive has shown that the German command still has a very large and combative reserve team, which can not only resist the enemy with powerful new equipment, but also continue to make an effective offensive. Germany's spiritual strength, human power, the excellence of weapons, and the material combat power will never be frustrated. This is another thing that can be proven. (The end)

Editorial

### Tuition Fee Collection Issues

Time flies, and the current semester is coming to an end, with the next semester fast approaching. Amidst these high prices, school fees for the next semester are sure to increase. However, how to increase them in a reasonable manner, considering both the burden on students' families and the actual expenses of the schools, is indeed a matter worthy of attention. We believe that the authorities of some schools, who truly aim to serve education, are undoubtedly worried that a large increase in tuition fees will make it impossible for students' families to afford them, leading to students dropping out midway. Therefore, they are hesitating and considering. At the same time, there are also authorities of some schools who treat running schools as doing business. Now that prices have increased, tuition fees should naturally increase proportionally, which seems reasonable enough. As for the problems of parents not being able to afford it, leading to students dropping out, they disregard them.

At the end of last year, Director Dai of the Municipal Education Bureau spoke about the tuition fee standards for the next semester. In addition to the existing regulations for municipal schools, for private schools, based on an actual survey of over 300 private primary and secondary schools with larger scales and longer histories, the average amount of tuition fees collected by each school per semester was obtained, and appropriate increases were made. A proposed collection standard for the next semester was then formulated and submitted to the government for review and approval half a month ago. Upon receiving instructions from the Bureau, it will be announced, instructing all schools to strictly comply.

From Director Dai's remarks, we know that the tuition fee standards for private schools for the next semester have been drafted by the Education Bureau, submitted for review, and have not yet been decided or announced. However, we have received reports from readers that some schools have already effectively set tuition fees, notified students' families, and urged them to pay reservation fees. These are approximately 20,000 *yuan* for junior high school and 15,000 *yuan* for elementary school (including a 2,000 *yuan* prepaid fundraising fee). Then, the standards set by these schools are not known to be based on what, and at the same time, it is questionable whether they can set and collect fees independently before the standards set by the Education Bureau are announced. Moreover, some schools are openly charging each student dozens of *yuan* for school investment subsidies, which is akin to arbitrary levies.

The purpose and significance of education are already understood by society, and there is no need to discuss them. Tuition fees are by no means comparable to prices and should not compete with them. We believe that the standards set by the Education Bureau should also not unduly accommodate the facts, relying solely on the needs of the schools and neglecting the significance of developing the entire education system. Moreover, before the collection standards are announced by the education authorities, some private schools have already set large numbers of fees? This should be corrected.

Secondly, we argue that no matter how high prices rise, they are ultimately unreasonable, and tuition fee standards should not be determined based on this. Instead, extremely low numbers should be set, assuming that universities do not exceed 10,000 *yuan*, senior high schools do not exceed 7,500 *yuan*, and junior high schools do not exceed 5,000 *yuan*. Public schools have funding to make up the difference, while private schools, based on actual expenses, can have the deficit beyond tuition fees fully subsidized by the government. Absolutely no additional miscellaneous fees should be allowed. As for the salaries of teachers and staff, standards should be set at the same time and raised uniformly, and if only essential necessities are specially allocated by the government, most of the salary problems will have been solved. In the past, many schools did not raise the salaries of teachers and staff with the increased tuition fees, but only pocketed them for the principals. We hope that the education authorities pay special attention to this.

Now, Mayor Zhou of this city is about to take office. Zhou has a good reputation from his time as Director of the Education Department of Jiangsu Province, and he has extensive experience in educational administration. We firmly believe that in the future, he will pay special attention to the educational affairs of this city. We especially hope that he will pay close attention to the serious problem of widespread school dropout caused by high tuition fees, and that the future of education will be very fortunate.

### Organization Methods of the Industry Friendship Association

The Shanghai Special Municipality Chamber of Commerce has received a letter from the various trade associations of the city's tea and food industry, requesting the organization of the Shanghai Flour and Noodles Products Industry Joint Association, and has submitted it to the Ministry of Industry for review and approval. The association has recently received approval No. 2067 from the Ministry of Industry, which states: "The establishment of industry joint associations is suspended by the joint organization of local industry associations. The request of the Shanghai Tea and Food Industry Association to organize the Flour and Noodle Industry Joint Association is limited to Shanghai only, and does not meet the regulations of the joint association, so it is difficult to approve. However, if the association, etc., is for the purpose of seeking public welfare, and there is indeed a need for organization, it can first form an industry fellowship association, and should first submit the articles of association, etc., for review and approval."

Smokers in other districts should apply for supplementary registration to the local Soviet Tobacco Bureau or office in charge.

### The Commercial Market Has Been Calm Since the Beginning of the Year

Since the beginning of the year, the purchase of goods in various industries has gradually become calm. The prices of various goods have not changed significantly, which is due to the sharp increase in the amount of material supply and the sluggish sales channels, resulting in a balance of supply and demand and stable public sentiment. However, some materials, such as soy sauce, vegetables, Shaoxing wine, salt, and cotton textiles, are still moving towards a high peak, and the trend of rising prices is quite intense.

Reader Scholarship News

### "Merchant Beggars" Respond to "Literary Beggars"

Commission-Based Scholarship

Mr. Yang Guangzheng initiated the "Begging for Righteousness" fundraising team for the newspaper's scholarship fund, and in his capacity as a "literary beggar", donated 20,000 *yuan* to China Film Company as the first team of "Begging for Righteousness". Then, Mr. Qian Gongxia, editor of Yulin, donated 2,000 *yuan* in response. I am a small clerk who can barely take care of himself, and I am usually ashamed of myself for not having the spirit of Wu Xun to "cultivate for others". Now that the end of the year is approaching, I have received a commission of 20,000 *yuan*. After reading the articles by Yang and Qian, and thinking about the difficulty of my own children's education, I decided to donate 2,000 *yuan* of "one thousand out of ten thousand" to your newspaper, in the capacity of a "merchant beggar" to respond to Mr. Yang, who calls himself a "literary beggar". Although my life is difficult, this time, for example, a small amount of commission has been allocated to Cheng Ling to show a little effort, in order to promote the idea of commission-based scholarships. "Who is not as good as me in loving goodness"? There are countless large and small companies and shops in this city. During this time between the old and new years, there are countless people who have received ten or a hundred times more bonuses than I have, from managers to all levels of employees. There are also many kind-hearted people among them. If everyone can follow this method of "commission-based scholarship", no matter if it is 10%, 5%, or even a few percent or a few thousandths, I think that hundreds of thousands of "Begging for Righteousness" teams can be easily formed. Not only will the 5,000 poor students of this newspaper be solved, but even ten times this number of out-of-school youths can be easily solved. For this reason, I respectfully ask the readers to do their part, each contributing a bit of strength, accumulating virtue and blessings, in order to complete this scholarship mission of "a hundred-year tree planting"! (Small Clerk's Manuscript Fee for Scholarship)

(Note) This person, who calls himself a "small clerk," is unknown to us. From what he has written, his words are filled with fervent emotion. No one can deny that he is an up-and-coming talent with ideas and vision in the business world. That is why I have published it as soon as possible, in order to attract the attention of employees in the commercial and industrial sectors, and to encourage them to unanimously agree and donate generously. It is better to act than to sit and talk!

Lisheng Bank Enthusiastically Supports Scholarships

"Your newspaper is organizing the 8th fundraising team for the scholarship fund, with each team pledging to donate at least 20,000 *yuan*. This is a righteous cause for scholarships, and I express my utmost support. In addition to raising 30,000 *yuan*, I personally pledge to donate 10,000 *yuan*, to do my small part. Herewith, I send a transfer order for a total of 40,000 *yuan*. Lisheng Bank pledges to donate 20,000 *yuan*, named Lisheng Bank Team One. I pledge to donate 10,000 *yuan*, and Zhou Jiaju and Li Dehua each pledge to donate 5,000 *yuan*, named Lisheng Bank Team Two. Please process accordingly and issue official receipts."

Chen Li, wife of the late Xiancai (a flower basket presented by colleagues of Zhenzhong Industrial Company, converted to a donation) 10,000 *yuan*, Li Da Xiang (sent by Liu Zhi on behalf of Chen Weiquan) 10,000 *yuan*, Meng Hanjiang 2,000 *yuan*, Chenxin Button Factory 1,000 *yuan*, Wang Xinjiang, Liu Ji, Rong Ji, 500 *yuan* each, Ye Qiming 100 *yuan*. A total of 24,600 *yuan* in stored coupons was received, with a balance of 7,357,378 *yuan*.

### Prospects for the Current Stage of the War (5): Roundtable Discussion by the Heads of the Shanghai Japanese Army, Navy, and Foreign Affairs Information Departments

Matsudaira: In short, a prolonged war is unfavorable for the enemy. Judging from their domestic situation and other factors, they have a strong inclination to seek a short, decisive battle. Therefore, all our citizens must renew their determination to deal with this.

Looking at the other side's highest guiding principles, there are generally two differing and contradictory ideas. One is to resolve the war as quickly as possible; Roosevelt and others are politically leading the nation in this direction. The other is the military's view, which is to prolong the war, increase military production, and make the outcome of the war favorable to the United States. This spirit is revealed in all aspects, with the military production issue being one example. In addition, holding various international conferences to discuss aviation issues and financial issues can be said to be the same thing. Viewing the enemy's actions from another perspective, it is also their weakness. Japan must not have such weaknesses. It is most necessary to wage war under a truly unified ideology. In this sense, Japan is centered on the Imperial Family, engaging in a war of self-preservation and self-defense to safeguard the national essence. In other words, it has a war objective worthy of heaven and earth. Under this clear objective, it is naturally possible to unify thinking and face the decisive battle stage. Isn't this very fortunate?

Matsushima: Often when the enemy feels anxious, we are finding the beginnings of victory. Just as Miyamoto Musashi believed that he could defeat his opponent when he gasped for breath, we should all strengthen our beliefs and accumulate our war power in the future, no matter how the enemy planes indiscriminately bomb us. This is necessary.

Continental New Daily News:

Today's newspaper reported that Churchill said in Parliament that if Britain were in Japan's position, Britain would have collapsed long ago, so Japan is truly a miraculous country. Such words mostly contain strategic purposes, right?

Matsudaira: Whether it is Churchill or Roosevelt, their messages to Parliament or publicly released statements contain strategies that Japan must pay attention to. They seem to be deceiving not only their own people but also attempting to deceive the Japanese people. General Suetsugu once postulated that if Roosevelt told the public that the situation in Europe and other areas was improving and that Japan would not be a problem, then the US Army and Navy generals would quietly say that it could not be resolved. As mentioned earlier, it will take a considerable amount of time. Isn't this trying to keep Japan from making efforts to prepare for the decisive battle? Therefore, what the enemy says must be carefully considered.

Tight Security Against Ideological Warfare

Idechi: For example, the telecommunications relayed from bases near Japan, such as Saipan and Tinian, all contain conspiratorial purposes. Therefore, we must have a firm belief.

Matsudaira: Their strategies are brilliant when it comes to deception.

Matsushima: They often cleverly reverse the words of famous people, for example, "This is what the Prime Minister said," or "This is what so-and-so celebrity said," thereby revealing their plot to confuse people's hearts.

Idechi: Especially in a place like Shanghai, there are many strategies, so we must pay close attention.

Matsudaira: On the one hand, the enemy also sees that due to the war situation and domestic conditions, the people's wavering is difficult to remedy, so they try their best to prevent the people from listening to Japanese broadcasts.

Idechi: They use radio waves to interfere.

Matsudaira: When their situation is perilous, their propaganda is further strengthened, as can be seen from past examples.

Matsushima: What is particularly noteworthy recently is that American newspapers are claiming that depending on how the war progresses, they may use poison gas. In addition, there is the so-called germ warfare, which seems to have been implemented in some parts of the front lines. This is something we must pay attention to.

Idechi: The Chongqing-US Air Force is suspected of spreading tularemia bacteria during this continental operation.

Matsudaira: However, their doing such a thing only proves their weakness.

Matsushima: A few days ago, I met Mr. Toyohiko Kagawa somewhere and talked about the white bones of Saipan and the brutality of the American soldiers on the front lines. Mr. Kagawa broadcast to the United States from Tokyo on November 8, saying that Americans have no personality and are like man-eating savages in the South Seas. They are definitely not Christians. Since Americans are as barbaric as cannibals, their use of poison gas and bacteria must be understood. In short, how to get through this year is the immediate goal. And in the local area, the first is to consolidate the ideological foundation, and the second is to increase production, and everyone must unite together.
