### Before the 30th of This Month, National Army to be Airlifted to the Capital; Commander-in-Chief He Instructs Jing to Relay and Prepare Everything

Zhijiang, 23rd—The Japanese surrender delegation, including Imai, who stayed here for fifty-one hours, left Zhijiang by plane this afternoon to report back to Nanjing. Commander-in-Chief He's headquarters received Imai at 1:30 PM. Guided by Major Chen, Imai arrived at the headquarters from his residence in a jeep displaying a white flag to meet Commander-in-Chief He in the reception room. Commander-in-Chief He stood behind his desk, with Chief of Staff Xiao Yisu, Deputy Chiefs of Staff Leng Xin and Cai Wenzhi, U.S. Military Operations Command Chief of Staff Brigadier General Patnode, and Director Niu Xianming standing behind He. Only a Central News Agency reporter and an American reporter were present. At 1:25 PM, Imai and his party arrived by car at the headquarters gate. Led by Major Chen, they walked slowly along a path of about one hundred meters to the door of Commander-in-Chief He's office. After Major Chen reported, Commander-in-Chief He summoned Imai. The Japanese staff and two accompanying adjutants stood at the door. Imai, still wearing his military uniform and sword, took off his hat and entered, standing silently and bowing to Commander-in-Chief He. Commander-in-Chief He immediately asked Imai, "Did you understand the Memorandum No. 1 that Chief of Staff Xiao handed to you on the afternoon of the day before yesterday at 3 PM?" Imai nodded and replied, "I received it." Commander-in-Chief He then asked, "Later, I sent someone to hand you three more memorandums. Did you receive them all?" Imai replied, "I received them." Then Commander-in-Chief He solemnly instructed Imai, "I have decided that you should return to Nanjing by the same plane. I hope you will relay to General Yasuji Okamura to strictly abide by the four memorandums." Imai replied without hesitation, "I will definitely relay it. Regarding the content of the memorandums, a decision can be made after the headquarters receives orders from the Tokyo General Headquarters." Commander-in-Chief He continued, "This headquarters has decided to begin airlifting troops to Nanjing between the 26th and 30th of this month. I hope you will relay this to General Yasuji Okamura to prepare everything." Imai bowed and replied, "Yes, I understand." Finally, Commander-in-Chief He declared, "This concludes today's discussion. You can now prepare to depart." After hearing this, Imai bowed deeply and withdrew. Commander-in-Chief He rose to acknowledge. Commander-in-Chief He's meeting with Imai lasted nine and a half minutes. The arrival of the Japanese representative to Zhijiang to negotiate surrender has thus come to a preliminary conclusion.

A Glimpse of Representative Imai Leaving Zhijiang

Zhijiang, 23rd—After Major General Imai met with Commander-in-Chief He, he immediately returned to his residence to pack his luggage in preparation for his flight back to Nanjing. After this news spread, the people of Zhijiang stood by the roadside, all wanting to see the face of this special Japanese envoy for surrender negotiations again. The American military also stationed troops at the airport to view the Japanese plane, and Chinese and foreign reporters also rushed to the airport to take photos. Security at the airport was tight, and access to the Japanese plane was prohibited. Although the Chinese and American military police restricted it greatly, the photographers were still unwilling to give up this rare opportunity. At 2:05 PM, the plane carrying Imai and his party began to taxi to the runway and slowly ascended. Six P-51 Mustang fighters had been circling in the sky for a long time, waiting for it to ascend to escort it to the Changde area.

Editorial

### Welcoming Vice Mayor Wu

The Deputy Mayor of this city, Wu Shaoshu, along with senior officials from party, government, and military agencies, arrived in Shanghai yesterday. In addition to representatives from all walks of life, a large number of citizens were at the station to welcome him, showing that Wu's reputation has been trusted by the general public. We also stand on the side of the citizens to express our sincere welcome.

Vice Mayor Wu has worked in Shanghai for seven or eight years, during which he has experienced countless hardships and difficulties. Putting ourselves in his shoes, it is not difficult for us to imagine a picture of struggle intertwined with hot blood. Now that victory has been achieved and the country has been restored, Wu has been ordered to assist in municipal administration and return to this land. Putting ourselves in his shoes again, it is not difficult for us to see a picture of glorious spirit. Since ancient times, the glory of a triumphant return and being welcomed has been something Wu can now enjoy, which is enough to repay the hardships of eight years of struggle.

Today, we not only welcome Wu with the highest enthusiasm to reward his past achievements, but also look forward to him with the most sincere enthusiasm, hoping that he will create a new historical page for Shanghai's municipal administration in the future.

At present, the municipal agencies have not yet fully taken over, and further progress in municipal administration will have to wait. However, it seems that active preparations and advance planning should be made in terms of preparatory work. We believe that future municipal work can be divided into three steps: the first step is takeover, the second step is consolidation, and the third step is transformation. Therefore, it would be premature to talk about improvement before the first step has been completed. And without the consolidation step after the takeover, there would be no basis for improvement. Therefore, what should be considered today is how to take over and how to consolidate.

Since Japan accepted the surrender, various central agencies have successively arrived in Shanghai and started working with great enthusiasm. However, with the establishment of many agencies, there are bound to be inconsistencies in pace and differences in measures. For the past seven or eight years, the citizens of Shanghai have not been directly managed by the central government agencies. The saying "A scholar who has been away for three days should be looked at with new eyes" reflects the sincere care and expectations of the people. Loving deeply and expecting earnestly are common sense, and looking at the trends of the past ten days, we often hear consistent criticisms in the streets and alleys. We believe that these criticisms are all based on sincere goodwill and should be listened to and considered.

Recently, the Office of Chairman Chiang's Representative in Shanghai has issued a notice requesting that the central and various other agencies in Shanghai report to the office for forwarding to the central government for reference in order to establish contact. Committee member He of the Military Affairs Commission also expressed the need to improve the guidance agencies. Now that Vice Mayor Wu has arrived in Shanghai to preside over everything, we believe that he will be able to promote a unified pace and strengthen the power.

Wu holds important party, government, and military positions in this city, and his talents have long been trusted by the citizens. In his first speech upon arriving in Shanghai yesterday, he stated that his priority would be to "strive to stabilize social order and relieve the suffering of the people." While expressing our respect and welcome, we also extend our sincere expectations.

### Special Economic Investigation Work in the Southeastern Region. Strict Prohibition of Illegal Acquisition and Transfer of Materials

The Special Economic Investigation Division of the Central Committee's Investigation and Statistics Bureau, under orders to investigate the special economy of the southeastern region, has established an office at 735 Foch Road in this city by Commissioner Fang Qinghe of the Southeastern Region. It has formally announced its official opening and is actively conducting special economic investigation affairs, with internal divisions for general affairs, investigation, and action. The first step is to conduct special economic investigations into the main materials seized by Japan in the past, the factories and businesses established, the content of their operations, and the business operations of the Sino-Japanese Chamber of Commerce. This is the most important work of the special economic investigation. In particular, as Japan has accepted the Potsdam Declaration and surrendered to our United Nations, it is inevitable that Japanese soldiers and civilians leaving Shanghai will collude with ignorant merchants to steal and sell goods. A detailed investigation is necessary. If there are ignorant merchants who, blinded by greed, secretly purchase materials seized by the Japanese, citizens are encouraged to report them. There will be strict punishment without leniency. All compatriots must not collude with Japanese merchants and Japanese military authorities to steal and sell military and economic materials related to the people's livelihood. If there is any of the above, whether directly or indirectly, it will be considered aiding the enemy. Pay attention to the illegal transfer of various materials at any time. Investigate the locations of warehouses left by the Japanese in various places. At an appropriate time, report to the authorities there. It is learned that the office has detailed information on past actions of merchants in the financial, industrial, and commercial sectors who have aided the enemy, hoarded goods, or made exorbitant profits. Subsequent investigations will provide concrete evidence, and they will also be reported to the government for sanctions.

It is also learned that the main internal personnel are as follows: Su Mao, Head of the General Affairs Group; Wang Yuanyang, Head of the Investigation Group; , Head of the Action Group; Geng Yan, Deputy Head.

### Committee Member He Makes a Speech: Hopes for Joint Efforts in Publicity Work

Military Commission Publicity Committee Member He Minhun was ordered a year ago to carry out counter-insurgency work in the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui areas. He came to Shanghai a few days ago. The reporter made a special visit to Mr. He yesterday. He gave a speech as follows:

Mr. He's Speech

"A year ago, I was ordered to go to the occupied areas to engage in counter-insurgency work to coordinate with the general counter-offensive. Later, I was ordered to serve as a publicity committee member, responsible for military, political, party, cultural, and economic aspects of counter-insurgency work in the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui areas, conveying the Central Committee's intentions, so that they would respond to military actions during the general counter-offensive. Therefore, I paid particular attention to the military aspects. Later, due to the rapid change in the international situation, Japan accepted the Potsdam Declaration, and I publicly established an organization. Furthermore, the situation in Nanjing was quite tense, so I personally went to consult with relevant parties in Jiangsu and Anhui to handle the matter. All work was satisfactory. This time, I came to Shanghai mainly to visit Mr. Jiang Bocheng to discuss work and improve the publicity organization, and to closely connect with the staff sent by the Central Committee. In terms of work, it is especially necessary to closely cooperate with the Party Headquarters. I have always advocated doing more work, enduring more hardships, humbly accepting opinions from all sides, and strictly guiding the will of Chairman Jiang to promote all work. As for those outside who go to various places to take over under similar names, I cannot be responsible for others, nor can I bear the blame for others. As for the handling of three or four cultural groups, due to procedural and technical issues that could not be , they have been corrected separately and will be successively handed over to the competent authorities. The Publicity Committee has established a temporary office in Shanghai to coordinate work with Nanjing and other areas. I hope that capable people in this city will work together and cooperate with the publicity plan so that all the people of the city can understand Chairman Jiang's concern for the locality. Because the progress of the work cannot be promoted by one organization and a few staff members, the gentry and people of the entire region must work together to ensure smooth progress."

### Beware of Disorder

— Cheng

Disorderly phenomena are the result of a lack of organization, system, and order, a manifestation of utter chaos.

Disorderly individual actions lead to adverse consequences for the individual; disorderly group actions lead to adverse consequences for the group; society and even the nation are no exception.

Therefore, all actions of individuals, groups, society, and even the nation must be organized, systematic, and orderly in order to achieve excellent results.

Especially in extraordinary times of volatile situations, when everything is not yet on track, we should strictly adhere to the principles of organization, system, and order, uniting with each other, aligning from top to bottom, to achieve common goals and strive for a bright future, avoiding acting independently and falling into disorderly phenomena.

### Self-Encouragement After Survival

— Jian Nong

An insignificant person like me, during the siege of my hometown eight years ago, surprisingly did not die from the bombing, artillery fire, or bayonets of "friendly forces." Now, I have emerged unscathed from the grave threat of machine guns and bombs. Truly, on that night when the news of peace was confirmed, I was so excited and deeply relieved that I tossed and turned in bed, unable to sleep! Consequently, a question, like a fly chased away only to return, constantly buzzed around my ears: "What will I do in the future?..."

Before answering this rather difficult question, the tide of thought compels me to reflect a little.

I still remember six years ago, living on the isolated island of Shanghai, which could still be called a piece of clean land. Due to the special circumstances, I deeply feared doing anything that would betray my conscience. Therefore, I extracted the four phrases "Disciplined Life, Strict Conduct, Noble Thoughts, Self-Sacrificing Spirit" as my motto and the guiding principle for my actions. In the first few years, I was conscientious and always vigilant, and I fulfilled my self-imposed vows as much as possible. However, in the past year, how passive and sluggish I have been, completely casting aside my previous determination! I, who used to "work like an ox," have transformed into someone as lazy as being on strike! But what power do I have to fight against this cruel reality? Every time I pick up a pen to write something, every time I enter the library to look up some materials, the question, "Will I become a sacrifice to the god of war this time?" is like a bucket of cold water poured on my head, causing me to collapse and stop. Recently, my mental state has been particularly bad, truly making people constantly have the thought of "Will I still be here tomorrow?" Therefore, in addition to my regular studies, I can only bury myself in novels, how much I have wasted my time!

Now that I have, fortunately, become one of the "survivors after the calamity," how should I make good use of the remaining life? What can I offer to the motherland, which must embark on the road of rejuvenation? What can I offer to the society, which must rush towards the path of construction? And how should I welcome the coming of this bright era? Speaking of this, I am apprehensive and ashamed. I am empty-handed and have nothing; I only have a determination to thoroughly correct my past mistakes and work hard in the future. I have made up my mind that I must strive to engage in work that benefits human society, and constantly expand...?

I revisit the old matter and revise the slightly hollow motto I extracted six years ago into the following four sentences: "Disciplined Life, Strict Conduct, Beneficial Work, Self-Restrained Spirit."
