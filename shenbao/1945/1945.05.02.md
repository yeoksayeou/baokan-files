Tokyo, 1st (Central News Agency Dispatch) — The Imperial Japanese Navy, in order to cope with the current war situation, has established a General Headquarters.

General Toyoda's Address to the Entire Army

A Certain Base, 1st (Central News Agency Dispatch) — "The rise or fall of the Imperial Nation rests on this one battle. Each and every one of you must strive even harder in combat." These were the golden words spoken by the holy General Togo Heihachiro thirty-one years ago on May 2nd, inspiring his officers and men to defeat the Russian fleet. Recalling the past and looking at the present, before we know it, the Japanese Navy Memorial Day is approaching again. As this memorial day draws near, the decisive battles on the southwestern islands are intensifying day by day. The Imperial Japanese Combined Fleet and the Army Air Force, working together closely, are determined to annihilate the arrogant enemy in one fell swoop, but the enemy is not yielding in the slightest and is strongly attempting to invade. Therefore, in the past few days, both sides have been exerting all their strength in a desperate battle, and the decisive battle has reached its climax. At this critical juncture, Soemu Toyoda, the Commander-in-Chief of the Combined Fleet, who bears the fate of the Japanese Empire, has now been appointed as the Commander-in-Chief of the Navy, commanding the three services in the vast Pacific Ocean. He has issued an instruction, conveyed to the entire army as follows: "I have now received the great order to serve as the Commander-in-Chief of the Navy. I am willing to share the heavy responsibility of this decisive battle with all of you, my officers and men. May all of my officers and men, both at home and abroad, fully understand my intentions and vow to eliminate the arrogant enemy! The glory of the divine land depends on today. As for how to cope with such a critical situation, I believe all of you, loyal and brave officers and men, already know it well: that is, for the entire force to become a special attack force and sacrifice yourselves for the great cause. Upon hearing this instruction, all the officers and men were filled with solemn respect and vowed to destroy the enemy.

### Allied Military Authorities Offer Rewards for Capturing Enemy Pilots Alive

Nanjing, May 1st (Central News Agency Dispatch) — Recently, the U.S. Air Force stationed in Chongqing has been indiscriminately bombing our peaceful areas, causing unwarranted damage to the lives and property of innocent civilians, which is truly hateful. During these bombings, enemy planes are sometimes shot down and crash, or pilots are forced to land due to mechanical failures. Our people, motivated by righteous indignation against these violent enemies, should certainly make efforts to search for and capture them. It has been learned that the Allied military authorities have established a reward system for capturing these violent enemies. Anyone who can capture an enemy alive, or provide confidential information about their hiding places leading to their capture, will be rewarded with 1 million yuan in cash. Those who provide confidential information, capture the enemy, and hand them over can do so to the nearest Allied forces.

Editorial

### The Greater East Asia Conference

The Greater East Asia Conference has already been held yesterday in Tokyo. The conference was attended by representatives from various nations, including China, Japan, Manchukuo, the Philippines, Thailand, Burma, India, Mongolia, East India, Annam, and Cambodia. It is truly an unprecedented grand meeting of East Asian nations. Especially held in Tokyo, a war-torn capital under the threat of enemy aircraft, it holds even more significance in demonstrating shared adversity and unity in resisting the enemy. We firmly believe that this conference will make a significant contribution to the decisive victory of the Greater East Asia War.

The various nations of Greater East Asia have long suffered from the oppression and humiliation of imperialism, and for over a hundred years, their vitality has been waning. If Japan had not launched the Greater East Asia War, who could have imagined that the representatives of these nations would have the opportunity to gather together and discuss the safeguarding of their own rights? Taking only the nations of Burma, East India, and Annam as examples, which of them had the right to send representatives to gather together before the Greater East Asia War? Therefore, the Greater East Asia Conference itself is evidence of the righteousness, revolutionary nature, and anti-imperialist nature of the aims of the Greater East Asia War. We firmly believe that future historians will have a fair judgment.

However, today the enemy, America and others, are attempting to counterattack Japan and East Asia under the guise of propaganda tactics, vainly attempting to deny the independence and freedom that the various nations of Greater East Asia have already gained with Japanese assistance, and vainly attempting to use the shackles of Western "democracy" to plunge the nations of East Asia back into the old order of imperialism! Taking the San Francisco Conference, which claims to resolve postwar international issues, as an example, there is no agenda item regarding postwar colonies and the issues of East Asian nations. Clearly, British and American imperialism believe that the old order before the Greater East Asia War was very reasonable and must be restored! Therefore, at this critical moment in the overall situation of East Asia, our East Asian nations must be even more united, concentrating the hearts, minds, and material resources of a billion people to finally shatter the daydreams of the British and American imperialists to rebuild a colonial and enslaving order in East Asia.

Among the nations of East Asia today, the two major nations of China and Japan undoubtedly hold the leading position. Therefore, to ultimately break the enemy's imperialist ambitions, complete the Greater East Asia War, and realize the Greater East Asia Declaration, the steadfast cooperation of the two major nations of China and Japan is essential in the current practical situation. However, it cannot be denied that regrettably, the unity and cooperation between the two major nations of China and Japan has always been incomplete, insufficient to meet the demands of the war situation.

The major problem in China today lies in the failure to achieve overall peace. Therefore, any effort in China's war participation is achieving half the results for double the effort. Furthermore, the so-called conversion of mainland resources into war power has been difficult to effectively realize. The reason why overall peace has not been achieved is due to the fact that the political, economic, and cultural facilities in the peaceful areas are constrained by various circumstances, failing to meet the ideal and failing to make the people under the rule of Chongqing gladly return. Another reason is that the Sino-Japanese War has dragged on for eight years, allowing the Communist Party to seize the opportunity to expand its power day by day. If the Sino-Japanese issue still cannot obtain a comprehensive and rational solution, then it can be asserted that the war resistance aims idealized by Chongqing, the peace movement aims idealized by the Nanjing Nationalist Government, and the aims of building a new order in Greater East Asia advocated by the Allied nation of Japan will all encounter even greater difficulties.

The comprehensive cooperation between the Chinese and Japanese nations is the decisive force for the future of the various nations of Greater East Asia. According to observations of the current situation, the cooperation between the Chinese and Japanese nations should begin with the realization of overall peace. The realization of comprehensive Sino-Japanese peace must focus on realistic issues, with each other implementing them in accordance with established national policies. However, if the evolution and development of the realistic situation requires the established national policies to be supplemented and revised, then the national policies should be revised accordingly to adapt to the reality in order to achieve the original aims. At the same time, the essence of national policies must be to adapt to reality. If propaganda and strategies are implemented in one way, while the actual measures are implemented in another, then the goal of achieving national policy cannot be achieved with half the effort for double the results. This is an issue that the Sino-Japanese situation must carefully grasp.

### A Bird's-Eye View of Qingpu

— Zhicheng

A Short Journey

Qingpu is one of the affiliated counties of Shanghai, belonging to Jiangsu Province. It is 34 kilometers away from Shanghai, covering an area of 810 square miles, with a population of approximately 300,000. It is located at the central point of the Beijing-Shanghai Railway, the Suzhou-Jiaxing Railway, and the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway.

I set off in the golden morning light on April 28th. The car lurched forward on the Qinghu Highway like an old horse. The highway itself was rugged, coupled with the age of the vehicle, making travel very difficult.

Passengers must get out of the car in front of the large inspection checkpoint in Wujiahang and undergo strict inspection. After passing this checkpoint, one can go directly to Qingpu. The wheat fields on both sides of the road are lush and lovely.

When I arrived outside Qingpu City (at 12:00 noon), the first thing that caught my eye was an ancient city wall, guarded by spirited Allied soldiers. In just two hours, the journey from Shanghai to Qingpu was completed.

Agricultural Production and Prices

Qingpu has approximately 700,000 mu of arable land. This year, the highest-quality land can produce three shi of rice per mu, with an average yield of approximately two shi per mu. For the entire county, a total of over 1.4 million shi can be obtained. However, after farmers hand over the purchased amount and pay agricultural taxes, they can only barely sustain themselves. The agricultural tax on farmland is collected in kind according to the regulations of Jiangsu Province for the 33rd year of the Republic, averaging one dou of rice per mu, equivalent to 22 jin. In cotton-producing areas, the agricultural tax paid is also calculated at one dou of rice. Among other products of the county, cotton ranks first, followed by soybeans, wheat, vegetables, etc., which are also produced in abundance.

General commodity prices, except for rice and daily necessities, are roughly similar to those in Shanghai. For example: soybean oil costs 1,500 yuan per jin, pork costs 1,200 yuan per jin, eggs cost 90 yuan each, and vegetables cost 60 yuan per jin. Rice within the city costs 68,000 yuan per dan, and the price decreases further west outside the city. Daily necessities are entirely transported from Shanghai, passing through numerous checkpoints along the way, so prices are naturally higher than in Shanghai. For example, a bar of Gu Ben soap costs 500 yuan, a ream of straw paper costs 200 yuan, and a large bundle of matches costs 500 yuan. Local fuel is rice straw, costing 50 yuan per bundle.

Local Public Security

Qingpu County is divided into eight districts. The city is the first district, and public security is currently very stable. The other districts in the countryside are in poorer condition. In addition to the police in the city, there is also a local defense team and a team from another location. Recently, the provincial government dispatched teams from other locations to Qingpu for reinforcement, so the armed guards are excellent. The people's own Baojia (neighborhood watch) organization, after being guided and vigorously promoted by the authorities, is also quite strong. Therefore, theft cases have gradually decreased. The people's military training, such as the self-defense corps, numbers approximately 5,000 people, all energetic youths. Under the strict guidance of County Magistrate Huang Liewen, they train diligently every day in the backyard of the county government, no different from the military. In addition, there are approximately [unclear] Allied soldiers stationed in the city, assisting in maintaining local public security.

Local Customs and Education

Qingpu's customs are quite honest and generous, and lawsuits are extremely rare. Education was quite developed before the incident, but it is not as prosperous as before due to environmental constraints. Currently, there is one county-run middle school in the city and a total of four public and private primary schools, and one people's education center. In the other districts, there are two private middle schools and approximately six private primary schools. However, their performance is uncertain due to a lack of good teachers. I have heard that the authorities are vigorously trying to improve them. As for cultural undertakings, the county government's propaganda section publishes the Hujiang Daily. Other newspapers, such as the Xin Shen Bao and the Zhonghua Daily, are transported from Shanghai.

Finance and Medicine

The county has banks: Local Bank, Guoqiang Bank, and Yuqing Bank. Remittances to and from Shanghai can be handled by various banks. There are two relatively large hospitals and six clinics of traditional Chinese medicine in the city. Recently, the county authorities purchased over 500,000 yuan of Western medicine from Shanghai, which will soon be transported to Qingpu. This move will be of no small benefit to the public health of the local people.

Current Transportation Conditions

The only land transportation between Qingpu and Shanghai is the Qinghu Highway, which runs from Daxilu in Shanghai to Hongqiao Road, via Chengjiaqiao, Wujiahang, Panlong, and Jiaodian, to the outside of Qingpu's East Gate. There are two inspection checkpoints along the way. The car business running this route is currently the Qinghu Long-Distance Bus Company of the Dashanghai Road Zhongnan Hotel. The company has large buses and small cars: the large ones can accommodate 40 to 50 people, while the small ones only have 6 or 7. The schedule is irregular, and they depart as soon as they are full. Recently, the fare for the large buses is 3,000 yuan per person, and the small cars require 6,000 yuan. However, the small cars travel faster.

The roadbed and bridges of the highway have been in disrepair for many years since the incident, becoming rugged and uneven, collapsing and unusable. The car travels with bumps and jolts, which is especially painful after rain. It is hoped that the authorities will improve them so that transportation between Qingpu and Shanghai can be smoother.

According to county government officials, recently, a large number of people and charitable organizations have been evacuated from Shanghai and relocated to Qingpu city and various suburbs. However, the details are currently being investigated by local Baojia organizations and will be reported later.

### US Military Production Significantly Reduced: Minister Matsudaira Reveals Enemy Anxiety

The Shanghai office of the Allied Japanese Embassy held its routine press conference yesterday afternoon. Information Minister Matsudaira announced the reduction in US military production. The main points are recorded as follows:

民需用品減少生產
### Reduction in Production of Civilian Goods

Recently, US military production has failed to meet planned targets, resulting in shortages of weapons, ammunition, and other military supplies. The head of the War Production Board has repeatedly advocated reducing the production of civilian goods, especially cotton yarn, cloth, paper, coal, leather, and rubber products, calling for a significant reduction in their production and urging national cooperation.

軍需生產減低原因
### Reasons for Reduced Military Production

According to the US authorities, there are three reasons why military production has failed to meet planned targets: 1. Excessive consumption. For example, the military supplies consumed during the Philippine Islands operation in December of last year were equivalent to the total consumption of the previous sixteen months. 2. Errors in the estimation of production planners. For example, initially, emphasis was placed on aircraft production, leading to a reduction in the production of artillery and shells. 3. Insufficient labor in the most urgent military production sectors. The authorities need 700,000 laborers and are even appealing in all directions. It was announced in December of last year that US military factories needed 300,000 laborers, which has now doubled to 700,000, demonstrating their anxiety to increase production.

取消定單蒙蔽國民
### Canceling Orders to Deceive the Public

While the US authorities are asking the public for cooperation on the one hand, they are announcing on the other hand that they will cancel 15% of military production orders. Considering the above facts, it can be seen that the US authorities are well aware that their military production cannot meet their planned targets, but to win public favor, they are using this "bitter flesh" tactic of reducing orders to deceive the public.

趙部長訓詞
### Minister Zhao's Address

Today is the fifth anniversary of the founding of the Central News Agency. I am very pleased to be here to participate. Although I serve as the Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Central News Agency, due to my own work, I cannot spend every day with you, which I consider a regret.

報道新聞指導民衆
### Reporting News and Guiding the Public

I just heard President Guo speak very clearly about the tasks that this agency should have. The most important tasks of a news agency are twofold: first, to report, that is, to report the news to the general public; and second, to guide. Because reporting, although based primarily on facts, cannot be entirely unbiased. The importance and urgency, accuracy and errors of the news should be distinguished. This agency was established after the incident, the environment is extremely complex, and resources are very scarce. However, today's achievements are very impressive. Although we cannot say that everything about the Central News Agency today is perfect, such achievements in just five years are not easy. These are the results of the efforts of the past presidents, the current President Guo, and all colleagues. You work for the country and the nation from morning till night, not from a professional point of view, hoping to get generous rewards. This point is especially admirable.

推動工作至全世界
### Promoting Work to the World

Speaking of the new mission of the Central News Agency after the reorganization, I also have some opinions. I hope that in the future, we will not only promote our work to all parts of China, but also to the whole world, so that the world has no spatial or temporal barriers, and promote the justice of our country. Although this is a difficult task to accomplish, it is up to people to do it. No matter how difficult things are, they are not impossible to accomplish. Look at how developed the communication industry is in various countries around the world, but in the early days, it was also very difficult. But they were able to overcome difficulties and seize the time, making every second count, and slowly they achieved great success. If others can succeed, we can naturally achieve it as long as we work hard.

我國有五千年歷史，但這五千年，不是一蹴而成的，他是經歷了無數的五年，乃至五十年五百年而成的。
Our country has a history of 5,000 years, but these 5,000 years were not achieved overnight. They were achieved through countless five years, even fifty years, five hundred years.

實現理想達成任務
### Realize Ideals and Accomplish Tasks

Although the Central News Agency is only five years old, who knows if it will not have fifty or five hundred years of history in the future? History proves that ideals can be realized. At this time of serious war situation, although the material conditions are not sufficient and human obstacles are increasing every day, we must still step up our reporting work, strengthen our guidance force, and realize our ideals and accomplish our tasks under extreme austerity. On the occasion of the fifth anniversary, I would like to put forward these words to encourage you all.

### Entertainment Venues and Shops Strictly Prohibited from Operating Overtime; Violators Will Be Reported to the Police Bureau for Punishment

The City Police Bureau manages entertainment venues and shops operating overtime, originally as a special measure for wartime frugality and strengthening protection of public security. The implementation method should be that each branch bureau divides the areas within its jurisdiction and assigns officers to be responsible for strict inspection. If any violations are found, a form must be filled out and reported to the main bureau, and a punishment notice should be issued as usual to impose penalties. This is to facilitate the investigation of the number of violations to determine the severity of the punishment. However, it has recently been found that many branch bureaus impose penalties without reporting, which is inappropriate. The bureaus have been instructed that in the future, any violations of overtime operation should be reported to the main bureau for penalty according to the regulations. It is also learned that the Second Division of the Bureau held a meeting of the directors of the Second Sections of each branch bureau the day before, where Director Ping delivered a speech, hoping that the directors of each section will strictly supervise and inspect the operating hours of entertainment venues, and report any violations truthfully to the main bureau for handling according to the prescribed methods.

### Director Gao Took Office Yesterday

The new acting Director of the First Division of the City Police Bureau, Gao Xian, officially took office at the Bureau yesterday morning. Mr. Gao has extremely rich knowledge and experience. This time, taking office as the Director of the Bureau will surely assist the Director in promoting administrative management.

### Strengthening Police Welfare Work

Since Director Jian of the City Police Bureau took office, he has been exceptionally concerned about the lives of police officers. Measures such as raising salaries and allocating free rice have been implemented. In particular, increasing the Police Welfare Society's fund and strengthening police welfare work has greatly reduced the burden on police officers. Recently, items such as cooking oil and cigarettes have been distributed. It is also planned to distribute 2 jin of table salt per person (85 yuan per jin) on May 2nd and 3rd. Daily necessities such as firewood, briquettes, kerosene, undershirts, and towels will continue to be distributed.

### Buddhist Lecture Pilgrimage

— Broadcasting

### Intention of Propagation

In Chinese Buddhism, apart from chanting scriptures and numerous rituals, there is very little academic discussion. Although general monks and laypeople have considerable knowledge of Buddhism, they mostly seek knowledge for themselves; while most monks only hope to accumulate merit and have a slight awareness of religious belief. Jing'an Temple in this city is a famous ancient temple on the sea, and often uses the reading of Buddhist studies as the learning work of Buddhists; therefore, two years ago, it established Buddhist lectures, inviting Buddhist scholars such as Dharma Master Jifeizhi to be the main speaker. The audience is often full every time, and the academic principles of Buddhism have been able to be popularized in society, arousing research and interest from all walks of life.

### A Glimpse of the Lecture Hall

On April 15th, the temple began the third Buddhist lecture, and invited Venerable Elder Dharma Master Ying Ci of the Huayan School to lecture on the Huayan Dharma Realm Xuanyi. That day was Sunday, and those who had time went to listen. At 2:30, I walked into the mountain gate, and at that time, listeners were coming in an endless stream. Among them were professors, students, civil servants, bank managers, virtuous women, and people from all walks of life, gathered together. The auditorium was a large hall, decorated very neatly; the middle was full of seats, with a Buddha statue enshrined on the table, and several rows of long tables and chairs, neatly arranged, truly a place for lectures. At exactly 3 o'clock, the bell rang loudly, and Venerable Elder Dharma Master arrived on time, dignified and approachable. After being introduced by Dharma Master Miga of the temple, he began to lecture. He first explained the essential issues of Huayan in detail, clearly and articulately, so all the listeners were immersed in this harmonious atmosphere, exploring the truth of wisdom.

### The Essentials of Huayan

This article is a great work by Nanshan monk Fashun, discussing the essence and changes of the universe, and how we should understand the relationship between them to achieve transcendence. In this era of declining morals and general confusion, we grope and wander aimlessly in our lives; therefore, we must understand this society and this life, and establish a philosophy of life. The author is not a Buddhist, nor has he studied Buddhism, but he always feels that the academic principles of Buddhism are a great and profound philosophy, which is more thorough and meticulous than Western philosophy. I think we all have an attitude and hope for life, which is the philosophy of life. However, this philosophy usually has no, and the academic principles of Buddhism are to give us an inspiration to recognize the path of life. We follow this path to deal with current problems and engage in social undertakings, and we will get a perfect life.

### Visiting the Temple

Listening to the lecture, I also got to meet Abbot Dewu and Dharma Master Miga of the temple to pay respects to Elder Yan, so I learned about their intention to hold Buddhist lectures. At the same time, I also learned about the work of Jing'an Temple in the past three years. Not only has it reorganized the temple affairs, followed the customs of secular Buddhist affairs, and reorganized the temple seats, but also in the lower courtyard in Nanxiang, it established a Buddhist Nanxiang Rural Elementary School, so that the local rural children can all get the opportunity to study. Every winter and summer vacation, the school runs Buddhist scholarships, rescuing many young people who have dropped out of school. It is also heard that the mountain gate is being rebuilt, and a Brahma stupa is being built next to the Yongquan Well in front of the gate to highlight the ancient site. At this time of hardship, this kind of construction is certainly not an urgent matter, but precisely because of the war, the decline of culture, and the demise of morality, if we can jointly complete this project in the possibility, it is very valuable. In addition, giving away winter clothes and are all very beneficial to society and worth reporting.

### Humanistic Buddhism

Finally, we have a new concept of Buddhism and temples. That is, the academic principles of Buddhism are a precise philosophy. Of course, we don't want to be a philosopher or a Buddhist scholar, but our life must have an attitude and strive, then the philosophy of Buddhism will give us an inspiration. In the past, we often thought that Buddhist life was otherworldly and passive, which is a misconception. At the same time, we often think that temples are another world in society, and the lives of monks and nuns have nothing to do with the world, which is also a misunderstanding. An ideal temple should be an organization that promotes Buddhist Dharma and serves society, not just seeking to eliminate disasters and pray for blessings or isolate from the mundane world. This spirit of raising (humanistic Buddhism) is our ideal Buddhism.

(Note: Buddhist lectures are now scheduled to be held every Wednesday and Saturday from 3:30 PM to 5:00 PM, and people from all walks of life are welcome to attend.)

### More than 300 Factories Have Electricity Restored

Industrial plants in this city, since the power supply was cut off last November, production has been stalled. They have repeatedly applied to the competent authorities for ways to restore it. The electricity company considered and responded, and from last month, it has separately approved a suitable amount of electricity for the factories of major industrial products to maintain operations. It is learned that last month (April) electricity has been restored, including factories in textiles, silk weaving, dyeing and weaving, daily necessities, chemicals, and raw materials, with the textile industry ranking first. However, the power distribution factories are limited to industrial production factories that require electricity, and general factories that manufacture luxury goods and consumer goods will not enjoy intermediate treatment. In addition, the industrial plants with restored power supply were investigated and approved by the relevant authorities.

### Spring Business Tax Preliminary Investigation Began Yesterday

The deadline for the City Finance Bureau to collect the declaration of business tax for all industries in the city officially ended on April 30th. From May 1st, it has proceeded according to the , Fashan, Madang, City Center, Chanbei, and Hongkou districts. The Bureau has assigned investigators to each district to conduct preliminary investigations into the spring business tax. It is reported that the investigators have been instructed in advance by the competent department on the necessary conditions for reporting duties, and will conduct the investigation step by step according to the steps to be investigated, and fill in the Daily Investigation Report Form to quickly collect and submit to the Bureau for detailed review. The merchants who have passed the preliminary investigation are given a green (inspection certificate) sticker to show distinction. The top of the certificate is printed with (Shanghai Special City Finance Bureau Guan Industry Tax District Collection Office), the middle horizontally lists (Business Tax Inspection Certificate), and the bottom is the (Day, Month, Year of the 34th Year of the Republic of China) text. If the Bureau needs to carry out a re-examination in the future, it needs to give the inspected merchants a red (inspection certificate). All the text on the certificate is the same as the preliminary inspection certificate. The main items of the business tax are very detailed according to the provisions in the daily report. Excerpts include business type, tax rate, capital or turnover, original amount declared (amount, tax amount), corrected amount (amount, tax amount), increased amount (amount, tax amount), and the name of the investigator.

### Public Security Propaganda Committee to Hold Inauguration Ceremony Tomorrow

### Special Tax Still Required for Using Similar Items to Purchase Ornaments

The Bureau of Finance stipulates that when purchasing gold and silver ornaments from various silver shops in the city with similar items as payment, a receipt proving that the special tax was paid when the similar items were purchased must be presented to avoid paying the tax again. Otherwise, the silver shop must collect the special tax in full on behalf of the government to prevent evasion. If a silver shop attempts to attract customers by intentionally waiving the special tax for customers who cannot provide proof or falsely reports tax exemptions for customers who have already paid, in order to profit from it, it will be punished by the Bureau according to regulations upon discovery, and the tax will be recovered as a deterrent. The Bureau has already issued a public notice to notify businesses.

### Bureau of Economy Urges Registration of Major Commodities

Regarding the registration of major commodities in this city, the competent authorities have already notified various trade associations to promptly complete the registration within the deadline of April 16th to May 15th, as announced. A reporter learned yesterday from the person in charge of the Municipal Bureau of Economy that since the implementation of the major commodity registration for half a month, those who registered on time were very enthusiastic, but there were still many who delayed and did not complete the registration. The various trade associations have been urged to inform their member businesses to promptly complete the registration procedures within the deadline. Once the deadline is exceeded, they will be punished according to regulations without exception. With only half a month remaining, all merchants and citizens should pay close attention and avoid harming themselves.

### Summer Food and Beverage Establishments Should Comply with Regulations

In order to prevent epidemics and ensure the health of citizens, the Municipal Health Bureau has specifically stipulated that from May 1st, restaurants, taverns, hotels, and places that sell food and beverages must comply with the following regulations during the summer season: 1.

### New Measures Established for the Collection and Settlement of Checks in the Banking and Money Industries

Due to the recent shortage of cash in the city, the number of checks collected and paid by various banks and money shops in the banking and money industries has increased, resulting in very busy work for the silver association, money shops, treasury income, and transfers. In order to prevent the issuance of bad checks and maintain the reputation of the industry, new measures for the collection and settlement of checks have been established and officially implemented starting yesterday (the 1st). According to financial sources, the silver and money shop associations fear that various banks and money shops in the industry may not be able to comply with the four measures specified immediately after their implementation. Therefore, in addition to separately convening administrative meetings of those in charge of each section, the associations and treasuries will also conduct detailed discussions on the income of each bank and shop to the treasury, the treasury to the central bank, and the summary and publication of general ledger accounts. The decided matters have been notified to each bank and shop for compliance.

### Basic Education Lecture Series Initiates Fundraising for Charity School Scholarships and Distributes Books as Mementos

All the students of the (Basic Education Lecture Series) organized by this newspaper, recognizing that the Shanghai News's various free elementary schools are well-managed and effective, but that funding has not yet been fully raised, have initiated a fundraising campaign for (Charity School) Scholarship Funds, with a goal of two million yuan. Anyone who donates 50 yuan or more will receive a bookmark as a memento. Currently, the students are conducting fundraising in various locations, and teachers and students from more than a dozen schools in the city are actively responding. Approximately 15,000 bookmarks have already been distributed, and it is expected that the goal can be achieved within half a month. The bookmarks are exquisitely printed with artistic designs and are visually appealing. The reverse side is printed with (Promoting the Spirit of Wu Xun), Responding to the Charity School Movement. This newspaper's service-oriented colleagues extend their utmost respect to individuals from all walks of life who have generously donated, demonstrating high sentiments and profound friendship.

### Saving Candy Money to Donate to Charity School Scholarships

All the fifth-grade students of the Affiliated Elementary School of Yu Xing Middle School wrote: (We are deeply moved and sympathetic that your newspaper has established free schools to help children who are out of school. To respond to this movement, our grade has initiated saving a week's worth of candy money, raising 20,000 yuan to be used for charity school scholarships. We know that this small amount of money is a drop in the bucket, but we hope that all the children in Shanghai can be determined to do the same, and then the result will be twice the effect with half the effort.)

### Planting a Wide Field of Blessings

1. Mr./Ms. Mian, deeply moved by the disaster-stricken areas, generously donated 100,000 yuan, divided into 40,000 yuan for small-scale loans from this organization, and 20,000 yuan each for maternity aid, poverty relief, and aid for orphaned children, in order to plant a wide field of blessings and bring good fortune. Additionally, Mr./Ms. Mian Shan also donated 10,000 yuan each to the nursing home and aid for orphaned children, with the same purpose.

2. Ren Zhe Shui Luo Wu Ren Lai Yu wrote: (I am respectfully offering 10,000 yuan, please divide it into 1,000 yuan each for your organization's poverty relief, children's welfare home, nursing home, and Xu Jia Hui Sacred Mother's Hospital. The remaining 4,000 yuan is donated to poverty relief, considering that poor and sick fellow villagers lack the means to find work and cannot afford to return home, and are in fact miserable beggars, especially to be used for the transportation expenses of poor and sick fellow villagers from Biyun (Yuyao) returning home. I know that this small amount of money is useless, but I occasionally think (accumulating fox fur from armpits), (accumulating sand to form a tower), if we can all fulfill our heavenly duty of mutual assistance, establish a return-home travel subsidy fund to assist poor, sick, and unemployed fellow villagers in dispersing and avoid suffering on the wrong path and falling into the hardship of a foreign land, it will embody the government's intention to disperse the population from above and benefit poor compatriots infinitely from below. This will be a great fortune for the fellow villagers and a great fortune for society.)
