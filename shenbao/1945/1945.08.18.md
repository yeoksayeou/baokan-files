### Chairman Chiang's Broadcast Address: The Belief of Eight Years of Striving for Victory is Realized Today, Permanent Peace is Based on Mutual Love Among Humanity

Seventeenth, Central News Agency Dispatch: According to a Chongqing broadcast: Chairman Chiang held a broadcast to the world and all Chinese people at 10:00 AM on the fifteenth. The original words are excerpted as follows:

Fellow countrymen, soldiers and civilians of the whole country, peace-loving people of the world:

Our justice has triumphed over might, and this has finally been proven in fact. This fact is also the success of our National Revolution's history. My China's belief of eight years of struggle in the darkness has now been realized. Regarding the peace that appears before us, we must thank the soldiers and civilians who sacrificed themselves since the beginning of our national resistance, thank the allies who fought together for justice and peace, and especially thank the Father of the Nation for leading us through the arduous path of revolutionary policy, enabling us to have this day of victory and success. Christians all over the world should also thank the merciful and omnipotent God.

My fellow countrymen, since the start of the War of Resistance, the suffering of the eight years has deepened day by day, but the belief in the War of Resistance has also grown stronger day by day. In particular, our compatriots in the occupied areas have suffered endless devastation and oppression, and have tasted hardship to the utmost. But today, they have finally achieved complete liberation and are seeing the light of day again. In recent years, the cheers and joy of soldiers and civilians in various places have overshadowed the past sorrow. The main significance is that the compatriots in the occupied areas have been liberated.

Now the War of Resistance has been victorious, but this is not the final victory. We must know that the meaning of war is not just another victory in the world, but even more so that the power of this victory is the common power of the world.

I believe that all of humanity in the world, and all Chinese compatriots, must unanimously hope that this war is the last war in which civilized countries of the world have participated in fighting. If this is indeed the last war, then although our compatriots have suffered indescribable and cruel pain, our gains from this are satisfactory.

The Chinese nation, living in the darkest of times, has been able to continuously strive with consistent benevolence and traditional spirit, knowing deeply that sacrifice for justice and humanity will surely receive due reward.

The mutual cooperation and respect that has arisen among the nations united by war around the world is the price of this war.

The Great Wall of anti-aggression built by the blood and flesh of the youth of our United Nations is not just a temporary alliance, but a common belief of mankind, a permanent combination. This is the foundation of the United Nations' victory and can never be destroyed by any enemy conspiracy.

I firmly believe that from now on, without distinction of region or race, the unity of mankind will surely deepen, like brothers and sisters. This war has promoted the belief and relationship of mutual respect and assistance among mankind, and further proves that world war and peace are inseparable. This is also sufficient evidence to prevent war from breaking out again in the future.

Here, I think of the words in Christ's teachings, "Treat others as you would like to be treated," and "Love your enemies," and I have endless feelings.

We must know that being kind to others is our traditional spirit. We have consistently stated that we are only enemies with the Japanese militarists, and will never be enemies with the Japanese people. Now that the Japanese militarists have been defeated, we must of course hold them responsible for faithfully implementing the terms of surrender. However, we must never attempt to humiliate the Japanese. We should show compassion to them and to the people who have been oppressed and humiliated by the Nazi militarists, and urge them to extricate themselves from sin.

We must know that answering past atrocities with atrocities will lead to endless cycles of revenge, which would lose the original meaning of a benevolent and righteous army. This is what every one of our soldiers and civilians should pay special attention to now.

Fellow countrymen, now that aggression has been defeated, we have not yet reached our true goal. We must thoroughly eliminate its aggressive background and potential.

We must also know that the reward of victory is definitely not extravagance and indolence.

We must know that the work after the end of the war requires us to take greater efforts to be responsible for reform and reconstruction.

At some point, we will feel that the reality is even more arduous and difficult than during the war. This reality may come upon us at any time and any place.

The work that will be more difficult than war in the future is how to make ordinary ×× workers who have been purely led understand their own mistakes, accept the Three Principles of the People, and understand which is reasonable, strength or justice. This is a task that China and the Allies must work hard on in the future.

I am convinced that the permanent peace of the world is built on the spirit of human democracy, mutual assistance and universal love. We should move towards this goal.

I urge all allied nations and the people of the country to believe that peace obtained by force is not permanent peace. The realization of permanent peace requires us to conquer the enemy on the battlefield of reason, make them deeply repent and return to believers in peace, and then we will achieve permanent peace.

The Soviet people do not feel that reconstruction and peace restoration are difficult, but they all believe that all post-war work will exceed what human labor can handle. Rebuilding the areas destroyed when the German army rushed in, and increasing the production of general necessities, will give the Soviet people a lot of work. Most foreign observers now predict that the Soviet Union's foreign trade will inevitably increase in the future, and at the same time, all foreign affairs will also increase sharply.

As for the negotiations on various issues, in terms of the sincerity expressed by Marshal Stalin and Mr. Molotov during the negotiations, I am convinced that Sino-Soviet relations will be maintained for a long time, and the several meetings with the residents of Moscow made me feel more certain about the reliability of Sino-Soviet relations. But I regret that I cannot stay in Moscow for a few more days. However, even this short stay has given me the most profound impressions that cannot be erased.

### Propaganda Committee Member of the Military Affairs Commission, He Minhun, Issues Proclamation

He Minhun, a Propaganda Committee member of the National Government's Military Affairs Commission, responsible for counter-propaganda work in the southeastern regions of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces, has established a temporary office. Yesterday, he issued the following proclamation:

To the Elders, Brothers, Sisters, and Compatriots of the Three Provinces:

The Japanese government has finally decided to surrender unconditionally. The ultimate victory of the sacred War of Resistance has been achieved. The long-awaited dawn has finally arrived. The arduous struggle of the entire nation over the past eight years, and the profound suffering you have endured in the occupied territories, have not been in vain. Now, with the affection of brothers and sisters, we extend to you our highest respect and sincere condolences!

The disarming of the Japanese troops in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, and all other occupied areas, and all peaceful reconstruction and restoration work, are being comprehensively planned by our Central Government and are being carried out separately. The Central Government also has concrete and complete policies for the future national construction plan, which will be advanced in an orderly manner. In this extraordinary period when light arrives and darkness disappears, there are more than ten thousand words we want to say to our compatriots in the occupied areas of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui. With a solemn and earnest attitude, we make the following agreements with our elders, brothers, and sisters:

1. In the wake of this great victory and during the Central Government's restoration work, do not act emotionally. Refrain from any short-sighted, immature actions or revenge-driven acts that do not contribute to the overall situation or even hinder the progress of peace.

2. While enjoying the joy of restoration, do not forget to treat Japanese women, children, and residents who are law-abiding and kind, as well as Japanese soldiers who have been completely disarmed, with a broad-minded, benevolent, and moral attitude befitting a great nation.

4. Extend the highest respect and sincere condolences to the anti-Japanese patriots released from enemy gendarmerie units or prisons, and to the Allied nationals who have regained their freedom from various concentration camps. Provide them with assistance in their lives to the best of your ability.

5. People in industry and commerce should continue to peacefully pursue their respective occupations, maintain the supply of essential goods for the people with harmony and cooperation. Various industry organizations should also wait quietly for reorganization.

6. Do your utmost to protect all public buildings and public utilities such as water, electricity, and transportation in various places, and maintain their full use.

7. Under the leadership of our Party and League comrades, all localities should immediately raise the national flag, convene mass meetings of the people, and hold various gatherings to celebrate this unprecedented great victory in our country's history.

8. Support the Central Government, trust the Central Government, assist the Central Government in promoting all restoration and construction work, strengthen the national sense of responsibility, promote a sense of duty, and with one heart and one mind, strive from beginning to end to complete the national revolution!

Long live the hardworking and meritorious Chairman Chiang! Long live the Republic of China!

Sketch of Puyuan Town in Jiaxing

By Yucheng

Puyuan Town is located southwest of Jiaxing City. The water comes from Tianmu Mountain, called Youhu Lake, also called Meihua Jing, which connects to the Rouge River in the east of the city. During the Spring and Autumn period of Wu and Yue, Fan Li carried Xi Shi here, so the water is beautiful and the people are peaceful. There are many famous scenic spots and historical sites. The locals are diligent in physical labor but neglect repairs, so the ancient legends have changed to this day. During the Southern Song Dynasty, Emperor Gaozong passed by here in a phoenix-drawn carriage. He asked the scholars and learned that it was Wutong Township. Believing that phoenixes only dwell in wutong trees, he settled his family here. Emperor Lizong bestowed the name Puyuan. Afterwards, the population gradually increased, and the Yan, Dang, Shi, and Si families were the most prominent. In the early Ming Dynasty, Lady Wa Jiuniang taught children to manage warp and weft threads, creating silk fabrics that were sold far and wide, from Huguang in the south to Pingjin in the north. To this day, it is still called silk town. Zhu Yizun's "Lake Rights Song" says, "Casually passing over Lady Jiu's Bridge in Puyuan, the sound of weaving girls can be heard at midnight," which gives a glimpse of the people's livelihood.

Transportation

The southern highway to Jiaxing City is thirty-two li. There are two buses daily, coming from Tongxiang, passing through Yuhui Township, Guojie Bridge, bypassing the south gate of Jiaxing, and then driving to the north gate. It takes about an hour to reach the railway. Most of the bridges along the road have collapsed and are supported by planks and trees, often in a state of collapse. The waterway south to Xiashi is thirty li, and to Wangdian is twenty li. There are fast boats, two daily, departing in the morning and arriving in the evening. The North Canal to Wuzhen is thirty li, and to Shimen is the same. To Xincheng is twenty-four li. In recent years, the bandits are not peaceful, and there is often vigilance.

Local Products

Tobacco Leaves: Approximately 5,000 dan are produced annually. Locals collect and process them in the summer, drying them with bamboo clips, and selling them to commercial firms. In the past, they were only used for dry and damp tobacco, but now they are also used as ordinary cigarettes. The taste is spicier and less fragrant, similar to that produced in Shudian Temple in Tongxiang. The price has risen in recent years, and a summer's business is quite considerable. Most of the local tobacco leaf businesses lack capital and sell to the city at any time, commonly known as "small masters," as they earn a commission.

Hemp Skin: Seeds are sown in the spring and grow until midsummer. The skin is stripped from the stalks and used as fuel. From June to July every year, it is collected from the surrounding villages and sold to the Jiangsu region. It can be used to make coarse hemp thread. The color is solid and the material is hard, not as widely used as white hemp, but it is produced annually and is regarded by the villagers as an important product.

Cypress Seeds: Produced in the southern villages of the town. The trees grow naturally and are not planted. They rely entirely on the connection between wild and domestic cypress trees, and it takes several years for them to bear seeds. They often grow on the banks of rivers and streams. In late autumn, there are many red leaves, and the flowers bloom brilliantly. In September and October, rice shops collect them, pressing them for oil to make candles, and they are indispensable in high-quality soaps and machine oil. Tens of thousands of dan are sold annually. In recent years, the felling of trees in the surrounding villages has reduced the production of cypress seeds. Within ten li, maple leaves are very rare. Replenishment and growth are slow.

Cloth: The history is very long. In the early Republic, iron looms were used, and the width of the fabric was increased to two feet. Most of them are made of local silk and are still durable. After 1927, the production of silk from various places increased daily, and business declined sharply. In addition, the people of the town considered the labor cost too low, so they abandoned this and changed to other businesses. Therefore, production is decreasing daily. Recently, due to the scarcity of cloth and high prices, making it difficult to purchase, the sale of silk has increased again, but only within a hundred-li radius. The sales volume is still extensive, but fashionable people think that the quality of the goods is practical and not suitable for women's clothing, so it is difficult to circulate smoothly.

Education

Before the incident, there was Jingye Complete Primary School, and Duanben Women's Primary School. Schools continued to open in 1938, and Meijing Middle School was established, adding Miaoqiao Primary School. In addition to the educational funds subsidized by the Jiaxing and Tongxiang districts, local donations and taxes are also used. The economy is not exhausted. Therefore, the teachers of one primary school have a monthly rice allowance, and their teaching is conscientious. Moreover, gentlemen such as Zhu Zhong are all normal school teachers, so the students are diligent, and the market guards the law, and the customs are simple and original, and the temperature is better than other towns in Tangbei. Recently, troops have been stationed to defend the highway, and some residents have to move. Often, old houses are unattended, and 30% of them are demolished and sold. Broken walls and ruins are everywhere, which remains to be rebuilt. The Daughter Bridge, Meijing, and Youhu Farm, covering hundreds of acres, with flowers and fruits gathered, and tourists stopping, are now frequently damaged, and the trails are desolate. The Sijia Bridge and the river are filled in, leaving only a corner of the red wall of the Liguan Zen Temple. Ten years ago, I often passed by here. Now, when I go there again, my eyes are different, and I can hardly tell what direction it is. I asked the villagers for directions to return, and I saw that the fishing and fishing places were covered with grass.

Public Security

The police station is located in the old house of Tan Gongyi Pawnshop, but now it has moved elsewhere. During the clearing period, the four suburbs of the town were fortified, and there were guards and inspections, which were very strict. Although there are bandits, there are not many incidents. In recent years, gambling has become more prevalent, and tea houses and restaurants stop cooking in the afternoon, and the people live in peace. The Fanyun Taoist Temple and the Xianghai Zen Temple, every time the Buddha is born, worship Guanyin. In the year of turmoil, the fields are deserted, and there is no repentance. It is said that the custom of respect and concession is still being studied. Xia Xinming revised Puyuan Zhi in thirty volumes, adding detailed revisions, and his expenses were donated independently, without raising a penny from the local area. However, charity is gradually becoming cold, and the old and weak who lack food and firewood often have no way to support themselves, and rely on the strong to help them.

The household flour for this period in this city has been allocated to various retail rice shops by the Shanghai District Flour Allocation Office of the Flour and Wheat Organization Committee. Supervised by the Municipal Economic Bureau, universal distribution began yesterday (the 17th). One municipal catty per person, priced at 2,500 yuan.

### Stock Exchange Suspends Trading

With the continuous sharp decline in the prices of Chinese stocks and thin trading volume, the Chinese Merchants Stock Exchange specially announced yesterday that trading would be suspended from today (the 18th).

### Reasons for the Sharp Decline in Chinese Stocks

The prices of Chinese stocks have repeatedly plummeted recently, reaching a point where no one is interested. It is understood that the repeated decline in Chinese stocks is due to the following reasons: 1. Large holders have already considered them as investment targets, and new capital inflow has stopped. 2. Speculators purchased stocks by borrowing against them, but suddenly encountered the firms stopping lending, forcing them to painfully sell off to repay old debts, creating an oversupply. 3. Public sentiment is cold, everyone is watching, and the shorts have been hit head-on. 4. The firms have stopped overdrafts, and many payment instruments have been returned. Brokers have had to pay on behalf of clients due to transaction restrictions, causing prices to continue to fall, resulting in brokers suffering their own losses. 5. Small investors are panic-stricken, and many longs are seeking to sell.

### Fifth Series Gold Certificates to be Cashed Starting Today

The fifth series of gold certificates issued by the Central Reserve Bank, after changing its method on July 29th and entrusting brokers in the securities market to sell them at market prices, were originally scheduled to be cashed in gold on September 30th. Now, due to the change in the situation, in order to demonstrate credibility, it has been decided to advance the cashing of gold to today (the 18th). Those who hold fifth series gold certificates can go to the bank at No. 23 Bund today to cash them in, with the fraction valued at 7 million yuan per tael.

### Gold Certificate Market Still Open Yesterday

The gold certificate market was still open as usual yesterday, but due to the sluggish market, no transactions were made, and there was no official market price. According to news from the market, the market is still open as usual every day to maintain business.

### Various Firms Ending Trust Business

In order to prudently manage their operations, the silver and money businesses in this city have temporarily suspended all lending. All previously loaned funds, whether or not they have matured, are being actively processed for settlement. It is also learned that the trust businesses of various banks are difficult to continue at present and a decision has been made to end them. They will be resumed in the future when needed.

### National Forum: The Responsibilities of Elementary School Teachers

By Zhang Chengyun

Nowadays, those who are elementary school teachers often regard the teaching position as a long journey and are afraid of teaching people. Alas! This is why our country's academics have not made progress so far. Education is the lifeblood of the nation, so those who bear the responsibility of education should regard education as a lifelong career. Mencius regarded educating the talents of the world as one of the three joys, because diligently teaching people is to loyally plan for the country. From this point of view, how great is the task of those who bear the responsibility of education! But all the tasks are nothing more than the following points:

1. Educating Children

The teacher's education of children is like a farmer's cultivation of fields. If a farmer cultivates the fields, he must diligently cultivate and carefully protect them, then he may have the hope of a bumper harvest. The teacher's education of children must also be diligently guided and carefully enticed, then the children will have visible progress. Although children have different endowments of intelligence and stupidity, they should be treated like gardeners observing the nature of plants and distinguishing the suitability of the soil, or with deep plowing, or with shallow planting, or with strong fertilization, or with light watering, and they should be patiently and kindly induced to become successful.

2. Should Have a Research Spirit

Confucius, who was tireless in teaching people, still had to learn without being satisfied first. The way of learning is as vast as the sea, and the world is changing day by day, so civilization is advancing day by day. Without diligent research, how can there be deep understanding? Therefore, all teachers must have a research spirit. But what I call research is not only to seek it from books and newspapers. There is a saying: "Good at borrowing." It is also said: "The stones of other mountains can be used to polish jade." Therefore, although it is said to be research, it is especially necessary to learn from teachers and friends, discuss with each other, and then prejudices will be eliminated, and reason will be seen.

3. Teachers Should Lead by Example

The reason why Confucius was able to become a model for all ages is that his actions were a model for the world, and his words were a law for the world, so he was able to gain the heartfelt admiration of his disciples. From this point of view, personality influence is what teachers should pay attention to. The American Philip also said: "Teachers should pay attention to everything they say." The influence of a teacher's every move on children is very great, so the teacher's treatment of children should be with sincere feelings, gentle attitudes, and superb skills to inspire children.

4. Teachers Should Mechanize Themselves

A complete machine is made up of parts. Large and small, from axles to screws, all perform their duties. If a part is damaged, it will hinder the whole. The teacher's relationship to the school is also the same. If there is a teacher in the school who neglects his duties and is lazy in his work, it will hinder the whole school. Therefore, since we claim to be scholars, we should not be teachers; if we are teachers, we should be diligent and brave, loyal to our duties, and be mechanized, and we must not allow the slightest indulgence.

In summary, these four points are the protection of teachers. If they can be followed without error, then our country's education may be close to success.

### Reader's Aid to Education News
### Last Chance to Help Support Education
### A Great Contribution to Patriotism and Loving the People

A guest asked, "With the opening of the situation and the realization of peace, how will the wartime lucky ones and the illegally obtained profits be dealt with?"

I said, "This is indeed a question worth studying. As for how to deal with it, the government will naturally have its own consideration in the future, and the common people need not worry about it. However, there is a last chance at the moment, which is to voluntarily donate a small portion of the industrial income, even if it is one ten-thousandth, or better yet, one thousandth, to be donated as educational aid to help poor students who are out of school. Because a few days ago, there were several urgent donations in Shanghai, such as the air raid disaster relief, etc. Now that the situation has passed, the need has decreased. Only the educational aid is still being actively solicited to meet the needs of the upcoming school year. In terms of time, it is truly urgent."

The significance of the education assistance movement has been described before and will not be repeated. Not only is it recognized by all sectors of society as the most proactive and fundamental measure, but also our central government has not spared any effort and has long commended this work of saving the country and the people as the most valuable movement. Therefore, patriots must love the people, and those who love the people must cooperate and support the education assistance movement to fulfill the duties of a national member. All people of insight, who care for young people, relieve out-of-school students, cultivate talents for society, and cultivate vitality for the country, should have the same heart and the same reason. Secondly, in terms of morality, the so-called "helping education is the best, and doing good is the most joyful." At this moment of glorious victory, I think people from all walks of life will also be happy to accept the sincere request of thousands of students and fulfill their wishes to love the country and the people.

### Northern Jiangsu Compatriots Hold Tea Party Yesterday to Welcome General Peng Xiaochao

General Peng Longxian (courtesy name Xiaochao), a special envoy of the Military Affairs Commission of the National Government for soothing Jiangsu and Shanghai, arrived in Shanghai two months ago and lived in seclusion in a certain area in the western district. He frequently discussed surrender matters with various troops in the occupied areas, and all matters have been settled. Now that overall peace has been realized, representatives of the Northern Jiangsu County Associations in Shanghai held a tea party yesterday afternoon at the Roman Hotel on Taishan Road to welcome General Peng for his hard work over the past few months. The atmosphere was warm. General Peng delivered a speech on the spot. The speech is recorded below:

Peng's Speech

"Longxiang was ordered by the Military Affairs Commission to come to Jiangsu and Shanghai to appease the people. It has been nearly two months since I arrived in Shanghai. Due to the environment and the nature of my mission, I have not been able to meet with friends and local elders, which I deeply regret. Recently, the situation has changed rapidly, and victory has arrived. At this very happy time, I am very grateful that my fellow countrymen have taken the time to hold this welcome meeting. However, I also feel very ashamed because I have not done much for the local area and the country.

The main task for my coming here was to persuade the troops in the occupied areas to turn to the Central Government. Recently, the situation has changed rapidly, and Japan has accepted the Potsdam Declaration of the Three Powers. Overall peace has been realized. The military and political officials and local people in charge here have been able to uphold the Central Government's intentions and do their best to maintain the local area, allowing the people to continue to live a stable life amidst the excitement. This point is most admirable to me.

In this time of rapid change, tense emotions, and the cessation of government orders, there are many enthusiastic people who care about the local area and have raised many important questions, asking me about them. I think the gentlemen present here may also have the same feelings. I would like to take this opportunity to make a brief report.

The first concern is the issue of public security. Because of the many years of the War of Resistance, the people have suffered, and the troops are mixed and disorganized, with inconsistent leadership. It is inevitable that there will be some suspicion among them. It should be known that the goal of the War of Resistance is to resist aggression and recover lost territories, in order to seek lasting peace. It can be said that all 450 million people in the country share this goal, but perhaps the methods adopted are different due to environmental factors. Now that peace has been realized, the military police and all administrative personnel in various places are able to abide by the instructions of the Central Government, stand firm in their posts, and do their best to maintain order and stabilize the people's livelihood. Although it has only been a few short days, they have already shown their spirit and achievements in defending the local area everywhere. I think this spirit will definitely be maintained in the future. Moreover, the responsible officials sent by the Central Government are already on their way and will arrive in the near future. Therefore, I think there is no problem with public security in Jiangsu and Shanghai.

As for the personnel serving in various agencies, at this turning point, although the Central Government has repeatedly declared that they should stay in their posts and work hard, there are still a few people who are hesitant and have a kind of doubtful psychology. I think this view is wrong. It should be known that the Central Government's intention has always been to be lenient. There are countless examples of this. To give just one recent example, the Central Government has repeatedly announced that it will guarantee the safety of life for the Japanese soldiers and Japanese women and children who have been disarmed and will not allow them to be mistreated or insulted. The Central Government is so lenient to its former enemies, so will it not be lenient to its own compatriots? I think all service personnel 1. should understand the intentions of the Central Government, 2. should ask themselves how hard they have worked, and should not be suspicious. Furthermore, the general public is worried that when the Japanese troops withdraw, the defense areas of domestic troops will be mixed and deployments will be frequent. Although they are now close to unity, they were previously opposed to each other. If misunderstandings arise, public security will be worrying. This is also an overestimation. Because any troops or any group in the country may have different views or different ideas. This is an inevitable phenomenon in the long War of Resistance. But their common goal is the same. What's more, after eight years of War of Resistance, the people have suffered so much, who doesn't want to live and work in peace, who doesn't want to recuperate and rejuvenate, and everyone should unite and work together towards the road of national rejuvenation, which is worthy of the motherland and the people. I think the national plan announced by the Central Government, all officers and soldiers who work for the country should understand and support it. Everyone works together to celebrate peace, and of course there is no need to worry.

Too much has been destroyed during the War of Resistance. In the future, local construction matters are in dire need of attention. I hope that everyone will work hard under the guidance of the Supreme Leader." Finally, Peng made a supplementary report on the situation in northern Jiangsu.
