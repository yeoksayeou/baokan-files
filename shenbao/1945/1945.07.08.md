### Soviet Union Seeks to Expand Influence into the Mediterranean Underground

Stockholm (京城), July 7th, Central News Agency Dispatch - According to a New York Times report from London: Soviet authorities issued a statement this week, stating that the Soviet Union should occupy a seat in the conference discussing the Tangier issue. Regarding the Soviet Union's ambition, which it has harbored for a long time, this historical ambition constantly stimulates the Soviet people, guiding them to "strive for influence in the Mediterranean." History indicates to the Soviet people that "Britain is indeed obstructing their path to progress." Now that British power is weakening, the Soviet Union can take the opportunity to rise and realize their ancient aspirations, giving the Mediterranean region a new look. In particular, in recent weeks, the world has observed the Soviet Union's movements regarding the Dardanelles Strait and Tangier. At the same time, the Soviet Union has been conducting restrictive secret activities in the Balkans, Trieste, Livorno, Italy, France, and Spain. Currently, Tangier is like a tempting picture in the eyes of the Soviet Union. In short, for economic, political, and strategic interests, the Soviet Union has no choice but to pay special attention to the status of the Mediterranean.

The Spanish people should seize the opportunity to rise up and rebuild a democratic republic so that they can also participate in the construction of the new international league."

The Southwestern General Counteroffensive and the Complex Relationship Between the United States, Chongqing, and Yan'an

Tokyo, July 7th, Central News Agency Dispatch - Amidst the calls for a general counteroffensive in the Southwest, the reasons why the American military did not land in South China to echo Chongqing's internal Southwestern counteroffensive are extremely complex. However, roughly speaking, they do not go beyond the following reasons, which are listed as follows:

Reasons for Not Landing in South China

The United States is anxious to land on the Japanese mainland; Chongqing's plan for a general counteroffensive in the Southwest has not reached a level of sufficient preparation for them to respond to; The Japanese army's mobilization system for defensive operations on the shoreline is too strong; Based on the experience of the Xiang-Gui battles, it is pointed out that no matter how excellent the ground equipment is, air power alone cannot overwhelm the Japanese army's advantage; The geographical conditions of South China. If the American military does not land in South China, then the Chongqing army will definitely not be able to launch a general counteroffensive in the Southwest, which is extremely clear to us. From the Hunan operation to the Gui-Liu operation, the Chongqing field army suffered significant blows, and the loss of the huge arsenal in Guilin was the main reason for weakening Chongqing's rear-line war effort. The reason why the Chongqing army is actively launching a general counteroffensive is nothing more than the fact that the Stilwell Road has been reopened and a considerable amount of air force and military supplies have been prepared in the Chinese mainland. The Japanese army has already understood this situation. The slogans of Chongqing responding to the general counteroffensive in the Southwest are merely empty rhetoric to fulfill their responsibilities to the American military. However, the Chongqing army and the American military's plans for operations against Japan continue to be upheld, and a large number of American ground troops have entered the Chinese mainland, established a Chongqing-America liaison officer system, and encouraged students and educated youth to join the army, striving to promote various policies.

American-Style Education for Officers

According to a broadcast from Chongqing on June 6th, the American military's Fourth Hundred and Seventy-Fifth Infantry Division and One Hundred and Twentieth Cavalry Division, known as the First Mobile Unit, arrived in the Chinese war zone via air from Burma in May, as announced by the U.S. military command in the region. During the previous Chongyang operation, the Japanese army engaged with mechanized units commanded by American officers. Furthermore, after entering Guangxi once again, there was also intelligence that a considerable number of American ground troops were active. However, in ground operations, not a single body of a large army was found, so it is perfectly clear that in mainland operations, they have always made Chongqing the sacrificial vanguard to complete their war plan. Macworth has said that in order to complete the war mission, China's huge manpower should be utilized, and through education and training, it should be transformed into a large number of armed forces, which requires great effort. Therefore, General Amos, along with three hundred American officers, were dispatched to the Southeast China-America Training Group in western Guilin to provide American-style education to the core officers of Chongqing. The training group moved to Guizhou Province before the Guilin operation to continue training. The youth recently called up by Chongqing's student recruitment movement have also entered the training group to receive American-style training. In short, in the past one or two years, American influence has infiltrated China at an extremely high speed. Currently, various undertakings in Chongqing almost cannot be established without the assistance and guidance of American influence. It is estimated that there are about thirty divisions of Americanized Chongqing troops, half of the Burma Expeditionary Force (about ten divisions), about fifteen divisions under the command of the Chinese Army and Air Force Headquarters, and five divisions directly under the Military Commission. In addition, each army division unit is also equipped with dozens of American instructors to make the training reach the functional level of the American military.

Chongqing Adopts a Large Military District System

Regarding the internal camp of the current Chongqing army itself, its war zone was in a state of chaos due to the previous Xiang-Gui operations. For example, Zhang Fakui's Fourth War Zone almost completely lost its war zone capability. Afterwards, from the end of last year to the beginning of this year, it began to rebuild the war zone system in order to make a comeback. It is said that Chongqing currently adopts a large military district system, combining the First, Second, Fifth, Eighth, and Tenth War Zones into the Northwest Military District (headquarters in Hanzhong), appointing Li Zongren as the commander-in-chief. The Third, Seventh, and Ninety-Three War Zones are combined into the Southeast Military Management District (headquarters in Qianshan), appointing as the commander-in-chief. The Burma Expeditionary Force, the Hunan-Guangxi border area, and the Shanghai-Vietnam border area are combined to form the Southwest Military District (headquarters in Kunming), with He Yingqin as the commander-in-chief. He Yingqin is currently also the Commander-in-Chief of the Chinese Army and Air Force, so it is feared that there may be confusion in his assuming this position, but the contents are roughly as above. According to recent reliable intelligence, Jiang Dingwen, the commander of the First War Zone in the past war zone formations, has already been replaced, and his position has been taken over by Deputy Commander Hu Zongnan. In addition, the Lu-Su War Zone, with the Shandong Peninsula as its hinterland, is nominally unconnected to the war zone, and a new Tenth War Zone has been established on the south bank of the Yangtze River from southern Anhui Province to Jiujiang, with Li Pinxian, a subordinate of Li Zongren, as the commander. Therefore, although there are no significant changes, it is said that Zhejiang and Jiangsu provinces have been reorganized into new war zones, and the "student army" of about four newly formed divisions in the Chongqing army's total strength is quite noteworthy.

Chen Cheng, the Minister of Military and Political Affairs of Chongqing, once bluntly stated that one-third of the Chongqing army, about one hundred divisions, would be reorganized, and the equipment of the remaining troops would be strengthened. This small elite main force organization of Chongqing is gradually becoming more excellent due to the student and intellectual youth's joining the army movement. Therefore, Chongqing has proudly claimed that it will soon realize about thirty divisions of "youth divisions" of mechanized troops. It is noted that Chongqing's intellectual youth joining the army movement began with the 100,000-man military movement in June of last year. Regardless of the motivation for recruitment, the recruitment results are generally good. Recently, these student soldiers have been sent to the front line and are facing the sharp edge of the Japanese army. These students all have excellent equipment and a sincere patriotic enthusiasm, so their morale and combat order are unprecedented. In order to train and educate these students, the Chongqing authorities established ten instructor groups and appointed Chiang Kai-shek as the group leader and Luo Zhuoying as the training director. Jiang Jingguo is the organization director. In addition, many American military instructors were hired. In order to encourage these young people, the Chongqing authorities made various slogans, such as "Put down your books and pick up your knives and guns," "The battlefield is like a classroom," and "What is the use of knowledge without a country?" There have been endless instances of these young people wearing military uniforms before enlisting and doing whatever they want without obeying discipline, leaving the responsible authorities with almost no appropriate way to deal with it.

Conflict Between Chongqing and Yan'an

Next, regarding the conflict between Chongqing and Yan'an and the American Air Force in Chongqing, the recent characteristics of the mainland war zone are the armed conflicts between the Chongqing and Yan'an armies in various places and the American Air Force in Chongqing destroying Japanese transportation routes. It is noted that almost all places in China are dominated by various political and armed groups. When Yan'an expanded its political influence this time, these groups rose up together and engaged in head-on conflicts with the Chongqing army everywhere. Therefore, the Yan'an army is extremely to avoid direct conflict with the Japanese army. This is Yan'an's consistent policy of expanding its territory since moving to northern Shaanxi in the 28th year of the Republic. Therefore, the Yan'an side actively launched activities, first ordering the commando work units to go south, establish contact with the indigenous Yan'an army, and implement its new program of encirclement. As a result, the Chongqing side was in a panic. Recently, it has been engaging in daily battles with these Yan'an troops in various places. Chiang Kai-shek, in order to prevent the commando work units under He Ying's command from going south to Hunan, has instructed Wang Lujing, the Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the Ninth War Zone and Commander-in-Chief of the Thirtieth Group Army, to "temporarily cease resisting the Japanese army in order to stop the Yan'an army from going south." The Chongqing regime's fear of Yan'an's expanding influence is greater than we can imagine. The Three People's Principles Youth League branches in various places of the war of resistance have thoroughly implemented the education of suppressing the Communist Party, and after the American Air Force stationed in Chongqing was transferred from the Twentieth Bombardment Group to the Mariana Islands, the Fourteenth Air Force advocated engaging in air operations, and P57 and P40 and other small aircraft patrolled the Wuhan area and the Beijing-Hankou and Guangdong-Hankou railways, attempting to destroy transportation lines. Recently, large transport aircraft have been used to transport soldiers and materials by air, which is noteworthy.

### Japan's Eastern Small and Medium-Sized Cities Suffer First Air Raids; Small Fires Occur in the Central Region

Tokyo, July 7th, Central News Agency Dispatch - About 200 B29s from the Mariana Islands base attacked the eastern military district from 11:30 PM on the 6th for four hours, carrying out incendiary bomb attacks on various small and medium-sized cities.

### Polish Government Implements New Policies

Stockholm (京城), July 7th, Central News Agency Dispatch - According to a Warsaw report: The new Polish unified government has first decided to take over the assets in England, and a committee has been established in London to be responsible for taking over these assets, which was announced by the Polish News Agency on the 4th. Regarding this point, according to informed sources, the Polish government-in-exile in London insists that it is the only legitimate government of Poland, and therefore such issues have caused a major uproar. On the one hand, the allied countries have recognized the new government, and as a result, the Curzon Line has been ceded to the Soviet Union as a price. However, determining the eastern border of Germany will become a major issue at present. Poland has now sent commissioners to East Prussia, West Pomerania, Silesia, and other places to cooperate with the Soviet army in assuming administrative responsibilities. The Polish Democratic Party of the new government is now beginning to implement a plan to solve the problem of the 7 million Poles living in the above-mentioned areas.

Weekly Commentary

### The Current Pathologies of Shanghai's Education Scene

— Guan Le

Education is the foundation of a nation, bearing the significant mission of training the next generation of citizens. Therefore, whether education progresses normally and reasonably is of vital importance to the future of the nation and society. As the saying goes, "You reap what you sow." The kind of education implemented now will produce the kind of citizens in the future. Whether society can progress and whether the nation's future can be bright can be known simply by looking at the current state of education.

However, when we carefully observe the current situation in Shanghai's education circles, it is truly heartbreaking. The various corrupt and dark phenomena of present society are all reflected in the education sector, causing it to be deeply affected. High prices and the pressure of life are further impacting the entire education field, leaving it barely alive and devoid of vitality.

If we haven't lost our reason and haven't forgotten our youth, then we must not allow the entirety of Shanghai's education to head towards failure and decline. If we still firmly believe that our nation's future will certainly have bright prospects, then we shouldn't sit idly by and watch Shanghai's education scene sink into a corrupt and dark place without attempting to save it. Therefore, I am now specifically expressing my personal observations, hoping that this will attract the attention of concerned individuals in society, and that they will collectively plan remedial measures. That is my sincere hope.

The abnormal and unreasonable phenomena in Shanghai's current education scene, which can have major and far-reaching impacts, are approximately the following four:

1.  More Like "School-Shops" Than Schools. Schools are institutions for imparting education and developing public intelligence. Therefore, schools should be a type of social undertaking aimed at public happiness, not a business enterprise for seeking private gain. However, in reality, it is not so. Since the outbreak of war, schools at all levels have sprung up like mushrooms after rain. As long as one rents one or two buildings and obtains a business license, they can openly operate. It truly is a primary school every ten steps and a middle school every hundred steps. Many boss-principals even regard schools as shops and running education as doing business. Some misappropriate school funds to engage in speculative ventures, while others deduct teachers' salaries in order to make illegal profits, even encroaching on teachers' rice rations and arbitrarily changing teachers. Disputes pile up, and scandalous behavior abounds. As a result, the sacred school is regarded by the general public as a contemptible "school-shop." In reality, there are also many principals who are self-respecting and want to run education properly to fulfill their duty as a citizen. However, good people are also influenced by bad people, rendering them unable to speak up. Therefore, in Shanghai's current education scene, there are certainly some who run education seriously, but there are also a considerable number of large and small "school-shops" that treat illegal profiteering as a means of production. This is the first pathology of Shanghai's education scene.

2.  More About "Teaching" Than Education. Teaching only focuses on the transmission of knowledge, while education should emphasize moral training. Most schools and most teachers mostly focus on the transmission of knowledge and neglect moral training. They believe that as long as one knows the words in textbooks and can write and calculate, they can be a teacher. Some schools also appeal to the emphasis on practical learning, teaching classical Chinese and foreign languages as early as the third grade of elementary school in order to cater to the psychology of the general public. As for things more important than the transmission of knowledge, such as healthy activities, character cultivation, and personality development, they are all ignored. Some schools even increase class time and add extracurricular work, while arbitrarily reducing subjects of mental training and skill training. Because of this cramming method of teaching and excessively heavy homework, lively and innocent children are taught to become dull and weak bookworms. These are still the good schools that run things seriously. As for the spiritually lax "school-shops," they simply hire some cheap and unqualified teachers, and even the two words "teaching" are beyond their capabilities. Therefore, Shanghai's schools at all levels, the upper tier turns students into bookworms who read books to death, and the lower tier turns children into crude and impolite floating youths. Entrusting the important task of building the nation in the future to so many children and young people, the dangerous situation is truly unimaginable. This is the second pathology of Shanghai's education scene.

3.  More a Job Than a Calling. Everyone knows that education is a sacred calling, a noble work. Therefore, those who bear the responsibility of education should first have a clear understanding of this. Those who run schools certainly cannot forsake their responsibilities for the sake of profit. It is difficult for ordinary people to work selflessly for the public good, and it is also difficult to work with peace of mind when one sees their family hungry and cold. Therefore, concerned individuals in society should rise up and find ways to alleviate the difficulties in teachers' lives and give them spiritual comfort. However, teachers should also have a habit of hard work and endurance, and be the spiritual backbone of the nation. Because they should know that the objects of their education are the pillars of the future nation, and the work they undertake is the foundation for future nation-building, which cannot be neglected or perfunctorily dealt with in the slightest. Many ignorant teachers do not understand that education is a service work, and they only treat it as an ordinary job, lamenting all day long that their income is meager, that there is no "extra income," and that they cannot obtain illegal profits like merchants who hoard goods. Therefore, they abandon their responsibilities and act perfunctorily. How can such corrupt teachers teach outstanding citizens? This is the third pathology of Shanghai's education scene.

4.  More Assimilation By Society Than Transformation of Society. Education is a constructive work that carries the mission of transforming society. People are able to discard the old and bring forth the new, evolving endlessly, all thanks to the effectiveness of education! However, the current Shanghai education scene not only fails to take on this important mission, but instead is constantly on guard, reflecting the darkness and corruption of society, and is assimilated by the bad society. For example, ordinary people only know how to hoard and defraud, and to fight for power and profit. As a result, principals also focus on doing business, education is also emptied out to run the market, and students also know how to hoard goods. With this kind of mindset, how can there be hope of transforming society? Schools rarely have a progressive and bright atmosphere, turning principals into old bureaucrats, parents into customers, and teachers into accountants. The spirit of respecting teachers and valuing the Tao is completely absent, and the mission of changing customs and habits is simply impossible to bear. This is the fourth pathology of Shanghai's education scene.

Since Shanghai's current education scene has the above four pathologies, how can we hope to implement normal and reasonable education? If a person harms or injures the body of a child through illegal actions, their parents or public opinion will certainly come out to interfere and protest. Now, this abnormal and unreasonable education is harming the hearts of millions of innocent children and outstanding young people. Are we still going to sit idly by and do nothing? Please rise up and face the pathologies of Shanghai's education scene squarely, and actively find ways to improve it. This is a blessing for the future of the nation and society, and it is also our responsibility!

### The Three Great Powers of Britain, America, and the Soviet Union

### The Conference Date is Approaching

### A Re-examination of the Relations Between the Three Countries

Lisbon, July 7th, Central News Agency: According to London reports, well-informed sources in London claim that the date of the three-power conference will have to be delayed until after the 10th at the earliest. At the same time, U.S. President Truman has repeatedly stated that the three-power conference will not be held until he and Prime Minister Churchill have met.

Tokyo, July 7th, Central News Agency: Since the end of the European War, the three-power talks expected by public opinion in Britain and the United States are about to be held. Although the location and date of the talks have not been officially announced, it is reported that they have been scheduled to be held in Potsdam, near Berlin, between this week and next week. Since the previous Crimean Conference, new changes have taken place in the relations between Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union, namely the collapse of Nazi Germany and the death of Roosevelt. The Crimean Conference was to consider the political issues in Europe after the end of the European War in advance. However, looking at the current situation, the decisions of the Crimean Conference have not been fully implemented step by step. At the same time, Roosevelt, Churchill, and Stalin were able to handle problems based on personal understanding, which could temporarily prevent the division of relations between the three countries. However, after Roosevelt's death, with the new President Truman taking office, it is necessary to re-examine the relations between Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union from a new perspective.

Different Means of Managing Germany

The biggest issue of the three-power talks is the management of Germany. As foreign dispatches have repeatedly reported, the management methods in the Soviet-occupied areas are completely opposite to those in the British and American military-occupied areas. According to reports, the Soviet Union treats the German people in the occupied areas with leniency, providing as much food as possible, allowing the restoration of trade unions, and encouraging the re-launch of activities by the Communist Party and the Social Democratic Party, completely pursuing its own policies. On the contrary, Britain and the United States do not allow any political organizations to operate, and the distribution of food is only enough to prevent starvation, implementing a harsh management policy. Although Britain and the United States have repeatedly protested to the Soviet Union, the Soviet Union has ignored the protests of Britain and the United States and arbitrarily promoted its own policies. Therefore, no matter what, it is difficult to expect the United States to unify its management of Germany, and the German people are now inclined towards the Soviet Union, and as a result, the entire Germany will be manipulated by the Soviet Union. Therefore, it is an urgent requirement to hold tripartite talks to discuss the issue of unified management of Germany. It is said that the reasons for adjusting the issues in East Asia and Europe, in addition to the Polish dispute, also include the handling of the Syrian dispute and the management of the Dardanelles Strait, and these two issues may be discussed at this meeting.

Difficult to Adjust East Asian Policies

However, it seems extremely difficult to unify the policies of Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union in East Asia. Recently, the United States has disregarded the Chinese Communist regime and adopted a policy of supporting the Chongqing regime, while the Soviet Union has called the Chiang regime fascist and has vigorously supported the Chinese Communist regime. Therefore, the mainland policies of the United States and the Soviet Union are completely opposed. If this situation is allowed to continue, as the New York Tribune said, it may even cause internal strife, leading to a dangerous situation. If the Kuomintang and Communist regimes enter into armed conflict head-on, the United States' strategy towards Japan will fundamentally be shaken. Song Ziwen's visit to Moscow this time is also related to the above situation, which goes without saying. Therefore, the United States believes that it is necessary to unify its policies towards the Soviet Union in East Asia. From this perspective, containing the Soviet Union's future position in East Asia is the most important issue for the United States. According to the British magazine The Economist, the resolutions decided at the Crimean Conference will not be changed, for example, the three-nation summit is only a one-sided meeting. In short, there is no possibility of unifying the policies of Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union, especially with conflicting interests. Although they claim to unify the three-nation policies in words, they are still in an opposing position in the implementation of actual policies, which is also a very obvious phenomenon.

### Meeting the Needs of Citizens
### Water Usage Limit Expanded
### Expansion Rate is Thirty Percent

With the summer heat approaching, citizen water usage is bound to surge. To meet the daily life needs of Shanghai's citizens, and with the consideration of sanitation and health during the summer, the relevant authorities have made a specific decision to expand the current water usage limit starting July 1st until the end of September. The rate of expansion is 30 percent. In other words, the water usage limit in February of this year will be reinstated. The authorities overcame great difficulties with a lack of coal and power supply, a desperate need for water by factories, and a shortage of materials for cleaning water sources and resolutely adopted this measure. One can say that this move placed the citizen's needs above all else. Therefore, we hope that citizens cooperate and conserve water to the fullest, to avoid waste. Those who exceed the usage limit or steal water will be cut off from the water supply and severely punished.

### Coal Exchange for Electricity Allocation
### Must Emphasize Coal Quality

The coal exchange for electricity allocation system is already in effect. It is understood that in order to assist the development of industries related to people's livelihoods, the authorities have overcome various technical difficulties and changed the electricity allocation regulations, increasing it from 430 degrees per ton to 600 degrees. However, users are hoped to pay special attention to the quality of the coal when delivering it, as poor coal quality greatly hinders power generation and its effectiveness will inevitably be reduced. Therefore, the standard composition is specified as coal with a calorific value of 5,840 calories and an ash content of less than 7 percent receiving 600 degrees of electricity per ton. Coal with a calorific value below 4,150 calories and an ash content above 10 percent will not be accepted.

### Using the Pretext of Bailing Out Vagrants to Extort Money Rampantly

Criminal Chen Jianqing Apprehended

The municipal vagrant labor camp is for educating vagrants and beggars, reforming hooligans and ruffians, and forcing them to labor, thereby increasing production and assisting in public security. The Municipal Police Bureau assists in detaining and sending vagrants to the camp. To strengthen the detention work, the first, second, third, and fourth detachments of the police bureau have each dispatched personnel to reside in the camp to handle the detention and dispatch of vagrants. Recently, the camp discovered that a criminal, Chen Jianqing, used the pretext of bailing out vagrants to extort large sums of money from ignorant women. The case arose when Zhao Jinbao, the husband of Zhao Zhou, was sent to the camp for confinement by the Xihongkou branch bureau on the morning of the 30th of last month. On the afternoon of the 5th of this month, Zhao Zhou brought a letter of guarantee to the camp, wanting to bail out her husband. However, it was found that Zhao Jinbao was arrested on suspicion of theft and was not a good person, so permission was not granted. At that time, Zhao Zhou said that she would ask a man named Chen Jianqing to find a way and that he had demanded 400,000 yuan in "expenses", of which 280,000 yuan had already been paid. She questioned why her husband had not been released. The camp, believing that this matter concerned the reputation of the police bureau, dispatched personnel to investigate and found the facts to be true. The criminal Chen was arrested and interrogated. According to his confession, he did not extort money from Zhao Zhou, but the rewards and travel expenses were given to him by her, totaling 280,000 yuan. He still tried to deny and evade the truth, but the facts of the case are clear. He has been transferred to the investigation section of the third detachment for further investigation in order to be handed over to the District Procuratorate for legal action. The camp authorities also stated that the vagrants are strictly investigated to ensure that they are indeed vagrants or hooligans. Those who are mistakenly detained and have legitimate occupations may apply for bail, but absolutely no fees will be accepted. If any of the above extortion occurs, it may be reported to the camp or the police bureau for legal action.
