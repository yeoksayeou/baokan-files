### Japanese Air Force Attacks Enemy Task Force Southeast of Kyushu: Six Enemy Ships Sunk, Forty-Six Enemy Planes Shot Down

Japanese Imperial Headquarters Announcement. Tokyo, 19th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced at 4:30 PM on the 19th: (1) Japanese air units are currently engaging an enemy task force of approximately 18 ships appearing southeast of Kyushu. As of the 18th, the confirmed results of the battle are as follows: one standard aircraft carrier sunk, one aircraft carrier or battleship sunk, one battleship or cruiser sunk, two destroyers sunk, and one standard aircraft carrier damaged. In addition, there are unconfirmed, significant results from ramming attacks. Forty-six enemy aircraft were shot down (including results from ground units). Except for a few planes that have not returned, damage to Japanese ground facilities is minimal. (2) This morning, the enemy task force continued its air raids, attacking Shikoku, Osaka, Kobe, and other areas in waves.

Tokyo, 19th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - The enemy task force that appeared off the coast of Kyushu on the 18th launched 1,400 carrier-based aircraft in waves against airfields in southern and eastern Kyushu between 6:00 AM and 5:00 PM. Simultaneously, a portion of the enemy aircraft bombed urban areas in the eastern half of Kyushu and strafed them with machine guns. Another small number of enemy aircraft attacked Shikoku and the southern and northern parts of Wakayama Prefecture, seemingly to divert Japanese air reinforcements. Japanese air units in Kyushu engaged the enemy and fought fiercely. The confirmed results as of the morning were 19 enemy aircraft shot down and two damaged. Furthermore, Japanese air units attacked the enemy task force before dawn on the 18th, seemingly achieving considerable results.

### Iwo Jima: Japanese Garrison Launches Final Counterattack, Claiming Over 30,000 Enemy Casualties in One Month

Tokyo, 19th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - The Japanese forces on Iwo Jima, facing overwhelming odds, have inflicted approximately 33,000 enemy casualties. After a month of fierce fighting, elite units in the Mt. Suribachi area decisively broke into enemy lines on the night of the 8th. By the 13th, Japanese forces launched a general attack. Japanese units in the northern part of the island and near Mt. Higashi held their ground, and Supreme Commander Kuribayashi ordered a final counterattack.

Lisbon, 19th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - The U.S. Pacific Fleet Command announced on the 16th that total U.S. Navy casualties on Iwo Jima have reached 19,938. According to an Associated Press report from Guam on the 17th, U.S. Navy casualties since the landing operation on Iwo Jima have reached 45% of the total force in 26 days, averaging 766 casualties per day, or one every two minutes. Unable to conceal these losses, the U.S. military authorities have been forced to release the figures. Further increases in casualties are expected.

Heavy U.S. Operational Losses - Central News Agency Report - Since the U.S. landing on Iwo Jima on February 19th, as of March 13th, total casualties have reached 31,900, averaging 1,387 per day, or 58 per hour. Averaging the casualties by area, there have been 3,750 casualties per square mile (Iwo Jima has an area of 8.5 square miles), representing an unprecedented level of losses in world military history. However, fearing a negative impact on public opinion, the U.S. authorities have underreported the numbers as follows: total U.S. Army and Navy losses in the Pacific are 53,770. This is the greatest price the U.S. military has paid in the Pacific campaign to capture Iwo Jima. The total number of troops engaged on the island is 61,000, with casualties accounting for 32.6% of the force, compared to 24.9% at Peleliu, 23.6% at Saipan, and 18.6% at Tarawa. These figures show a significant increase. Observing these statistics, it is clear that the closer the U.S. military gets to the Japanese mainland, the greater its losses will be. Therefore, future U.S. operations will inevitably require sacrificing even more troops.

### Endo and Takagi Promoted to Admirals: Announcement by the Japanese Navy Ministry

Tokyo, 19th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - Vice Admiral Datto Kiichi, who fought valiantly on various fronts in the Greater East Asia War and established distinguished service, unfortunately died in action in the Southeast Pacific in 1944.

### Non-Combatants on Saipan Murdered by U.S. Forces

Central News Agency Report - According to an announcement by the Pacific Fleet Command, U.S. forces murdered 12,000 Japanese civilians on Saipan after occupying the island. Americans have always adhered to a belief in white supremacy, viewing people of color as inferior races. Therefore, their murder of people of non-white races is akin to slaughtering animals. Their inhumane behavior has reached its extreme. In the past, during the Opium War, there were instances of murdering Chinese people. More recently, they bombed Chinese civilians in peaceful areas. Their cruel methods against non-combatants are too numerous to mention.

### On Implementing Evacuation Measures for Charitable Institutions

— Chen Binhe

The issue of population evacuation in this city has moved from a proposal to a reality. The municipal government has organized a Population Evacuation Committee, inviting individuals from all walks of life and relevant authorities to serve as members. The committee began operations on the first of this month, actively promoting the evacuation. Yesterday, the executive group of the committee and the Bureau of Social Welfare jointly convened a meeting of representatives from charitable institutions in the city. Today, the liaison group of the committee and the Bureau of Social Welfare jointly convened a meeting of representatives from various Shanghai native-place associations, all to discuss the implementation of evacuation measures.

Based on yesterday's meeting of charitable institutions convened by the executive group, the Evacuation Committee has decided that charitable institutions should be evacuated first. We have long argued that charitable institutions have no need to remain in the city center. Whether for safety, economic, or environmental reasons, it is advisable to move to rural areas. Based on the report of Gu Jiwu, director of the executive group, we would like to offer the following suggestions to the charitable institutions:

(1) Regarding the location of evacuation, the Evacuation Committee has tentatively chosen Dongting Mountain and is currently investigating and negotiating. If charitable institutions of the same religion own houses and land in the interior, they should assist each other in borrowing them to reduce the responsibility of the Evacuation Committee.

(2) It has been stipulated that there is one month for the preparation of the evacuation. During this month, the evacuation work should be prepared quickly, such as sorting out the necessary utensils to be carried, the simpler the better. Any employees who are unwilling to evacuate should be properly dismissed, but with the principle of not staying in Shanghai.

(3) Regarding transportation, although the Evacuation Committee will provide boats and vehicles, charitable institutions should try their best to find transportation on their own or organize marching teams to reduce the Evacuation Committee's responsibility.

(4) Charitable institutions of the same religion and similar nature should sincerely discuss merging with each other. Even those of different natures should also cooperate and take care of each other. For example, if ten units are evacuated at the same time, if they can be merged into five or seven units of the same nature, the work of the Evacuation Committee can be reduced proportionally. At the same time, the evacuation work can be speeded up. It is absolutely impossible to rely on the Evacuation Committee for transportation and expenses and still hold the past parochial views of each acting on its own.

(5) In the past, there were two common concerns among charitable institutions: one was the maintenance and sustenance after evacuation, and the other was the safekeeping of the original real estate after evacuation. Now the Evacuation Committee has effective solutions to these two points. First, after arriving at the destination of evacuation, the municipal government will organize a fundraising committee to take responsibility for the unified distribution of food and the minimum necessary funds, so that there will be no worries about the future. However, the subsidy funds are only limited to institutions for the elderly, orphans, disabled, and deaf-mute. Religious organizations are excluded, and among the aforementioned subsidized institutions, those that have full or partial self-sufficiency capabilities will also be rationally allocated based on the actual situation. Second, Director Gu has explained in detail the issue of property custody in Shanghai in Section 6. However, in a wartime environment, even if there is no relocation and it is necessary to requisition for military purposes, it is impossible to refuse.

In short, the most important thing in the implementation of evacuation work at present is still the issue of transportation. With the preparation for evacuation and the destination of evacuation, it is still impossible to evacuate without sufficient means of transportation. In addition to the charitable institutions that should be evacuated first, there are many people who voluntarily evacuate back to their hometowns. These people are only waiting for the solution to the transportation problem, and there is no other problem. Now, under the Evacuation Committee, there are specialized committees for land and water transportation, which should actively carry out their work and must work effectively. It is reported that the waterways are based on Ningbo, Jiangbei, Suzhou, and Hangzhou, with the East Asia Shipping Company, China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, and Inland River Shipping Company providing ships, and the municipal government providing coal. Then, objectively, there is a definite grasp of solving the transportation problem. As for land transportation, the Evacuation Committee will handle the transportation itself, renting or requisitioning vehicles, and making full use of the Shanghai-Wuxi Highway and its branch lines. Evacuation transportation, whether by land or water, should be carried out by special trains or special ships, without mixing with ordinary passengers. The reason why we advocate this is that evacuation special trains or ships can be protected by the military and police along the way, and will not be unexpectedly delayed at stations and docks, or be bothered by inspections at checkpoints in various places, which can save time quickly. If mixed with ordinary passengers, either ordinary single-gang passengers will take advantage of the evacuation name to cheat, or the evacuation personnel will be delayed and affected by the inspection of ordinary passengers.

### Japanese Army Opens the East River

Guangzhou, 19th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - After the Japanese army captured Yaocheng Shaoguan of the Seventh War Zone of Chongqing, they immediately started reconstruction work and carried out various constructions. Recently, the Japanese army stationed in China, in addition to opening the West River, has now opened the East River, which is also known as the two major rivers of Guangdong. The highest commanders of the army and navy have announced this to the public on the 18th.

### Yu Xijie Arrives in Nanjing and Makes a Statement

Nanjing, 19th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - State Councilor and Vice President of the New People's Society, Mr. Yu Xijie, arrived in Nanjing from Beijing this morning. The reporter rushed to visit him and received the following statement: "I came to Nanjing this time by telegram from the Chairman. Before leaving, I received a telegram from the wartime situation symposium of the various sectors of the people, from which I learned that a wartime people's representative meeting will be held here. Regarding the election of representatives from the North, the New People's Society was instructed to actively assist. The New People's Society believes that this measure is necessary to express the true will of the people, so it has been actively carried out, and it has been decided that the New People's Society's provincial and municipal associations will select, from among the representatives of the annual provincial and municipal joint associations, those who meet the purpose of directly representing the people, and will ensure that they all come to Nanjing to participate before the meeting."

### List of Chongqing Representatives to the San Francisco Conference

Macau, 19th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - Huitong News Agency reports: Chongqing news: The delegation sent by the Chongqing government to the San Francisco Conference has not yet been announced. It is feared that Song Ziwen will be the chief representative, and the remaining members are still under consideration. The unofficial list of members is roughly as follows: Wang Chonghui, Secretary-General of the Supreme National Defense Council; Gu Weijun, Ambassador to the United Kingdom; Wei Daoming, Ambassador to the United States; Shang Zhen, Head of the Chinese Military Mission to the United States; Hu Shize, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs; Xu Mo, Minister to Australia; Zhang Junmai, leader of the National Socialist Party. It is likely that General Chiang Kai-shek will not attend, but Chongqing officials remain silent on this matter. The National Congress of the Kuomintang has been set for May 5, at which time Chiang will have to attend in person.

### Germany Again Denies Seeking Peace with Britain and the United States

Berlin, 19th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - Huitong News Agency reports: German political reports state that newspapers in various countries are spreading rumors that Germany is exploring peace, or that General Rundstedt, commander-in-chief of the German forces on the Western Front, has requested an armistice from General Eisenhower, or that German personnel stationed in Sweden have contacted personnel at the British Embassy in Sweden, suggesting a separate peace with Western countries. German officials have denied these rumors, denouncing them as attempts to frustrate Germany's will to fight. The anti-Axis powers are using psychological warfare and terror bombing to assist military operations, knowing full well that Germany will not be defeated militarily. Propaganda that the enemy is weary of war and seeking peace is a common tactic in wartime. This propaganda can reduce the enemy's self-confidence, while encouraging war-weary people in one's own country by the enemy's search for peace. The current rumors that Germany is suggesting peace also serve the above purpose. However, German leaders and the public have understood the enemy's purpose and the anti-Axis powers' principle of unconditional surrender. Germany will never forget the statements made by Roosevelt, Churchill, and Stalin regarding armistice and peace, and Germany will not accept these conditions of national destruction. The German people are willing to perish together with the enemy.

### 2,000 U.S. Planes Attack Berlin in Broad Daylight

Stockholm, Sweden, 19th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - According to a London dispatch: Yesterday, the U.S. Strategic Air Force, escorted by 700 fighters, used 1,300 Flying Fortresses to carry out a daylight bombing of Berlin, dropping a large number of bombs and incendiary bombs on Berlin's central train station and military factories in the suburbs. German air defense was also fierce. According to previous news reports, the U.S. Air Force has begun to use airfields in German territory, so the bombing battles will be more intense in the future.

### Situation on the Western Front

Berlin, 19th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - Huitong News Agency reports: The enemy's attempt to cross the Rhine River southwest of Duisburg failed. There is fierce fighting in the bridgehead east of Remagen.

### Soviet Army Launches Offensive in Upper Silesia

Berlin, 19th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - Huitong News Agency reports: Fierce fighting is currently unfolding in the southern part of the Upper Silesian industrial area. The new Soviet offensive began on both sides of Schwersenz (Zweierzähl) and near Grottkau, with the aim of targeting the Mährisch-Ostrau industrial area, but it was ultimately blocked by German forces. The Soviet army, advancing from Ratibor, infiltrated the Leobschütz district. The area south of Grottkau was controlled by the northern forces of the German army, aiming to take the German strongholds on the opposite bank of the Oder River, opposite Oppeln. Although the Soviet army concentrated a large number of armored vehicles in this battle, its attempt to sweep through the German positions in the area ultimately failed. The enemy is now gathering more troops and weapons to participate in the operation, but the war has not yet reached its climax. There is also a major battle on the northern section of the Eastern Front. The Soviet army's repeated attacks on Stettin were also suppressed, so the enemy's plan to control the mouth of the Oder River has been thwarted.

### European Livelihoods Under the Iron Heel of Britain and America (Part 1)

"Freedom, Liberation!"--The British and American armies shouted these slogans as they launched their European invasion campaigns in southern Italy and northern France. But have the many countries where the British and American forces are stationed truly gained "freedom and liberation"? In the eyes of Britain and America, destroying Germany's military apparatus is certainly important, but what is more important is making all of Europe their economic slave. When many countries are exhausted, they immediately throw themselves into the embrace of Britain and America upon hearing the beautiful and tempting words of "loans and aid supplies." However, after surrendering and taking a closer look, Britain and America are no longer wearing that hypocritical mask. They are now different from what they promised before.

Abuse of Military Scrip

When an army of one country invades another, it is of course natural to use military scrip with clearly defined responsibilities as the currency of the time. However, the military scrip issued by the British and American forces when they landed in southern Italy and northern France was initially intended as a vicious tool to sacrifice the invaded people.

When landing in Italy in July of the year before last, the exchange rate of the lira was devalued by 83 percent, and military scrip was issued as the national currency of Italy. By August of last year, a total of 87.5 billion lire of so-called Italian national currency had been issued indiscriminately. However, this military scrip was printed with the words "Issued by Italy," which shows that the initial intention was not to take responsibility for its redemption.

Is the Italian Bonomi government satisfied with this? At that time, it had requested loans from Britain and America equivalent to the occupation expenses, so Roosevelt explained that the military scrip would be redeemed with loans. However, when it comes to redemption, the burden of issuing the military scrip will naturally fall entirely on the shoulders of the Italian people. In addition, so-called "invasion francs" were used during the Normandy landings. These were printed in the United States, with the words "Issued by France in 1944" on the banknotes. There were eight denominations, ranging from 2 to 5,000 francs, with a total value of 82 billion francs. After the de Gaulle government was established in Paris, the following compromise conditions were concluded regarding this military scrip.

(1) The right to issue currency is transferred to the de Gaulle government.

(2) The currency issued by the British and American forces will be accepted by the de Gaulle government, and new currency must be exchanged for this currency when it is issued.

(3) However, the amount previously issued and the amount of future expenditures by the British and American forces will become debts of the British and American governments.

The exchange rate is based on the ratio of the Anglo-French agreement concluded in Algiers in February of last year, but that exchange rate was 12 percent lower against the pound and 8 percent lower against the dollar than before the war.

One US dollar equals 50 francs.

One British pound equals 200 francs.

Although such regulations were made, the results of runaway inflation have already reduced these amounts significantly, so that by the end of last year, one British pound equaled 900 francs. In the case of Belgium, the Belgian government-in-exile supplied the British and American troops with all the necessary currency because the British and American forces were fighting Germany for Belgium. The currency supplied by Belgium to Britain and America included old banknotes taken abroad during the exile, as well as new banknotes printed in London and new coins minted in the United States. In addition, regarding the Netherlands, because neither the government-in-exile nor the British and American forces had prepared Dutch currency, they had to endure and use Belgian francs for a while. As a result, military scrip flooded everywhere, like a river breaking its banks, and was enveloped by runaway inflation.

Soaring Prices

Let us first examine the actual situation in Italy. The so-called devaluation of the lira by 83 percent means that 100 yuan is equivalent to changing to 17 yuan. In addition to the 87.5 billion lire in military scrip, according to a survey at the end of last year, there were also 260 billion old lire banknotes. Naturally, there will never be a healthy national life under these conditions.

There is no exception to the skyrocketing prices. For example, the price of macaroni, a famous Italian product, is even 110 times higher than the pre-war index. An egg costs 35 lire, a kilogram of white sugar costs 400 lire, a kilogram of butter costs 350 lire, a pound of white bread costs 45 lire, and a pair of leather shoes costs 5,000 lire--these were the market prices in the autumn of last year. However, a worker's daily income is 30 lire, which is only enough to buy one egg.

Although it is all southern Italy, the misery of major cities such as Rome, Naples, and Florence is particularly shocking. The normal population of Rome is 1 million, but the number of refugees suddenly doubled to 2 million. Northern Italy, the food-producing area, is burning in the flames of war. Previously, the British and American forces had promised "If you surrender, we will give you bread and meat," but not only did they not fulfill their promise, but they came to loot military food everywhere. For example, if the minimum daily food ration for each citizen is 200 liang, then the monthly food ration for 2 million citizens is 50,000 tons, which must be guaranteed, but in reality, only 20,000 tons are distributed. Even so, most of the food has become the object of hoarding. (To be continued)

### Charitable Organizations to Prepare for Evacuation Within a Month: Report by Director Gu of the Executive Group of the Evacuation Committee

In order to actively prepare for the evacuation of charitable organizations, the city's population evacuation committee specially convened a discussion meeting with charitable organizations in the city at the city government meeting room yesterday (19th) afternoon at 3:00 pm, jointly with the Social Welfare Bureau, to discuss various issues regarding evacuation.

Afterwards, Gu Jiwu, director of the Executive Group of the Discussion Meeting, reported, and his main points were:

(1) The committee assumes that the evacuation destination is Dongting Mountain and is investigating reception. If various groups have other safe locations, they are free to choose them.

(2) A one-month preparation period is stipulated. After one month, the committee may notify the groups one week in advance, and evacuation should be implemented.

(3) Regarding the issue of transportation, the committee will assist all groups that handle their own transportation; otherwise, the committee will supply transportation vessels.

(4) It is hoped that groups with the same religion or similar nature will merge as much as possible within this one-month preparation period.

(5) After the evacuation of various charitable organizations to their destinations, the city government will organize a fundraising committee to be fully responsible for the overall planning and distribution of food and minimum expenses. The personnel of the committee will be organized from Shanghai's enthusiastic public welfare figures.

(6) The houses in Shanghai of all groups evacuated from Shanghai will be protected by representatives appointed by the groups and the above-mentioned committee.

(7) Regarding the reporting procedures for moving, simplified methods have been established, and each group will be a unit and handle it centrally.

After Gu's report, Director Zhou added some supplementary explanations. Then, various representatives present raised some questions, which the committee members answered separately. The discussion ended after more than an hour.

It is also learned that if various charitable organizations in the city have any questions about the evacuation procedures, they can inquire at the discussion meeting information desk (Shen Bao Newspaper Office).

Social Service

### Increasing Confidence and Perseverance: Readers Enthusiastically Respond to Charity School Fund

Our preparation to establish a free primary school aims to allow unemployed teachers to educate out-of-school children. We know this undertaking is exceptionally difficult and cannot be shouldered by a single organization or a small number of people. However, we are prepared to dedicate our full energy, at least to take on the task of communication and mediation, that is, to arouse the power of society to sympathize with our work and advance towards the goal according to our work steps. The greater the power of society, the greater the achievement of the work.

The first thing that increases our confidence and perseverance is the enthusiastic sympathy and support from readers. Following Mr. Xie Lilin's proposal to establish a "Charity School Fund" and his initial donation of ten thousand yuan, several readers expressed their enthusiastic support yesterday. The sentiments expressed were very moving, and excerpts from their letters are as follows:

(1) Zhou Guoxiong, an employee of Kangyi Fashion Company, wrote: "After reading Mr. Xie's letter to your newspaper, I was deeply moved. In today's pressing circumstances, there are countless out-of-school children. Who doesn't have children? This situation is truly heartbreaking. I am a small employee – a so-called wage earner. The difficulties of life are imaginable. After reading the letter today, I thought of Wu Xun, who begged to establish schools hundreds of years ago, and I am truly ashamed. Therefore, without overestimating my abilities, I extracted a portion (estimated at two thousand yuan in Central Reserve Certificates) from my extremely difficult living expenses to contribute to your newspaper as a 'Charity School Fund.' As the saying goes, 'A small stream cannot replenish a great river.' This is just to express my sincerity!"

(2) Cai Hekang, an out-of-school apprentice at the Lvbao Tobacco Shop on Tiantong Road, wrote: "Today I saw the news that you are going to run a free primary school and that Mr. Xie Lilin has launched a campaign to raise a 'Charity School Fund,' which made me very happy because I am also a child who dropped out of school due to life's hardships. I often want to study, but I don't have the opportunity. At the same time, I can imagine that under such oppressive living conditions, there are countless people like me. Now that you have established a free primary school, there is an opportunity to enroll, which is such a good thing. However, I think that since there are so many out-of-school people, ten schools will definitely not be able to accommodate them all. I hope you will open more schools quickly. Now I am donating one thousand yuan that I save every day as a 'Charity School Fund.' And I hope that enthusiastic people in society will quickly respond and save us poor out-of-school children!"

(3) A small female porter wrote: "Today I saw the news in your newspaper about the establishment of a free school, and I was very happy. Because I am also one of the out-of-school children. Now, forced by life, I have to go to the Jing-Hu Railway to work as a porter. Fortunately, it has been going well recently, so I will donate two thousand yuan of pocket money saved today as a 'Charity School Fund.' Although this amount is very small, I hope that your newspaper will do its best to solicit donations from all enthusiastic people so that many free primary schools can be established. Then, maybe I can also enter a free primary school in the future, be able to get the hope of studying, and no longer suffer from the pain of dropping out of school!"

The above three letters, especially the latter two, judging from the handwriting and sentences in the original letters, are full of extremely pure and sympathetic enthusiasm. Although their donations are not large, their value of sympathy is extremely high, so we are happy to publish them. Of course, we also hope for large donations from other powerful individuals.
