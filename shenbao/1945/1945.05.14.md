Tokyo, 13th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - Since the 11th, enemy forces in the southern region of Ryukyu Island, under the cover of air power, have launched a full-scale general offensive. East of Kouchi, the Japanese army is still securing its original positions, shattering the enemy's offensive. West of Kouchi, enemy forces have entered various locations including Kyozuka, the northern highlands of Sawa-Azuchi, and Anza. Japanese army units are currently engaging them in fierce counterattacks. The enemy's first wave of forces, approximately 50-60 tanks and around 2,500 infantry, are being engaged in guerrilla warfare by Japanese army units on the island, causing the enemy to feel extremely distressed. At the same time, the activities of enemy mobile units have gradually subsided. The number of enemy aircraft approaching the archipelago line this week has ranged from a maximum of 400 to a minimum of only 6, indicating that enemy mobile units have retreated far to the southeast, urgently seeking to maintain their strength. The number of converted aircraft carriers, remodeled from large cruisers, is no more than three or four.

Editorial

### Gold Certificates and the Gold Certificate Market

The Central Reserve Bank is issuing gold certificates to withdraw currency and avoid inflation. This is a noteworthy financial event recently; however, we believe that the political significance outweighs the economic significance. Please elaborate.

In recent times, the international war situation has changed dramatically, and some citizens are inevitably feeling bewildered by the changes. The instability of the social economy has also contributed to increasing public anxiety. Therefore, to stabilize public morale today, it is certainly necessary to rely on political efforts, but more practically speaking, it is essential to find solutions within the national economy. The most serious threats to the national economy today are production stagnation and soaring living costs. Among these, the depreciation of currency, which speculators exploit to exacerbate the trend, is the most important cause. In response to this reality, it is crucial to seek countermeasures urgently, such as stabilizing the currency and withdrawing currency, which can directly curb speculation and stimulate production, and indirectly achieve the goal of stabilizing public morale. The issuance of gold certificates this time aims to withdraw currency and, in principle, can simultaneously achieve political effects.

Judging from the actual situation of the issuance of gold certificates, the total amount issued in three days has reached about 11 billion yuan. With plans to issue a second and third phase in the future, the amount of currency withdrawn will be even more considerable. Therefore, it can be said that preliminary success has already been achieved.

However, upon further examining the economic depletion of the people and the general social psychology, there are reasons not to be overly optimistic about the issuance of gold certificates and the establishment of a gold certificate market. It is important for the relevant authorities to pay close attention to these concerns. Regarding the ultimate goal of issuing gold certificates and establishing a gold certificate market, as stated by Finance Minister Zhou and Advisor Kimura of the Central Reserve Bank, it is unnecessary for us to elaborate. In terms of the current financial sector and the actual situation of the people, the most urgent need is how to guarantee the value of the currency they hold. If, given the rampant rise in gold prices, it is assumed that everyone has a strong concept of valuing gold and gold certificates are issued to satisfy their desires, it may be akin to tailoring shoes to a foot already cut. Therefore, how to stabilize the currency's value is the fundamental problem at hand. As long as the currency's value is guaranteed, gold prices can be stabilized without suppression, and there will be no need to worry about general commodity prices remaining unstable. Now that the authorities are using the issuance and trading of gold certificates as a means to withdraw currency and stabilize finances, they must pay attention to two points:

* How to prevent gold certificates from becoming a new speculative commodity in the provincial capital?
* How to prevent the price increase in the gold certificate trading market from causing a further decline in the value of Central Reserve Bank notes?

That is, how to maintain a fixed relationship between gold certificates and Central Reserve Bank notes? These are all countermeasures that must be planned in advance! If sound countermeasures are not swiftly devised for these two problems, it cannot be ignored whether the gold certificate market in Shanghai, which has a deep historical connection with speculative frenzy, will achieve the authorities' intended goals or even lead to the opposite result.

After carefully examining the symptoms of today's social economy, we deeply feel that some of the economic controls that are incongruous with the national conditions must be revised as soon as possible, and the value of Central Reserve Bank notes circulating among the vast majority of the people must be given more practical and effective guarantees. As long as these two points are handled, the industrial depression and runaway inflation that have become "the economic crisis" can be fundamentally resolved. At that time, if further efforts can be made to support small and medium-sized industries and implement principal and interest guarantees for those who provide production loans, the social economy, which is on the verge of collapse, can gradually show signs of recovery. Conversely, if we do not make more efforts in this area of cultivating the foundation and nourishing the vitality, then other stopgap measures, even if they are effective for a time, will not last. We recall that when the authorities restored the Chinese stock market the year before last, they held expectations for the stock exchange to guide idle funds and revitalize industry, but the evolution to this day has yielded the opposite result. Recalling the disastrous consequences of gold speculation and trading before the incident, we are concerned and cannot but ask those involved to devise sound preventative measures.

### Township Construction Experimental County - Dangtu

— Yifu

The car that departed from Wuhu at 3:30 PM passed the large iron bridge spanning the Guxi River at 5:00 PM and soon arrived at Dangtu Station. In the fields on both sides of the railway, farmers were often seen busy with their work, some plowing, some tilling, some repairing field ridges, and some herding cattle. The wheat fields were already covered with green wheat ears, while the roots of the wheat stalks had turned yellow. The rapeseed plants had also formed seed pods, with some yellow withered flowers still attached to the tops, making them appear very sparse. Between the wheat and rapeseed, fields cultivated with milk vetch, blooming with bright red flowers, were often seen. This is the only effective self-sufficient fertilizer available to local farmers. Near the water, the rice paddies were filled with tender green rice seedlings.

Next to the Guxi River railway bridge on the west side, there is also a long wooden bridge called Taiping Bridge. There were plans to build a new-style stone bridge on the east side to allow highway vehicles to pass, but this project was put on hold due to the war. Now, only the pilings remain, and vehicles passing through this area use the old Taiping Bridge as a substitute. The railway bridge has been attacked by air once, but fortunately, it was not hit. The Guxi River runs through the county, connecting to Danyang and Shi Ri Lake in the east and to the Yangtze River in the west. Goods can be transported from here to Gaochun, Lishui, Danyang, and even Wuxi. Moreover, the area irrigated by the river is very large, making it the lifeline of transportation, agriculture, and water conservancy here.

Not far from the station, there is a Guxi Park, the only place of entertainment in the area. Surprisingly, there are no theaters or other places of entertainment to be found here. The park is currently undergoing active renovations. Although the area is not very large, the ponds, pavilions, flowers, and trees are arranged in an orderly and elegant manner. There is a large hall in the middle, which recently housed a Cuicui Teahouse, which, in addition to selling tea, also provides recent books, newspapers, and magazines for temporary rental.

The commercial center of Dangtu is located in the Dong Street and Xi Street area. The shops and inns are all native buildings with a quiet and secluded atmosphere. Unlike the modern buildings of Wuhu's major banks and the China Hotel, there is, at most, a touch of Westernization on the facades. The local area has suddenly become important due to changes in transportation lines after the war, and commerce has developed daily. The main commodities are local and nearby agricultural products, such as rice, wheat, rapeseed, and miscellaneous grains, aquatic products from the riverside area, and Biao Core Paper from Xuancheng. Grain is mostly shipped directly to Wuxi, while aquatic products are transported by train to Shanghai for sale.

Agricultural processing industries include oil presses, rice mills, and distilleries (using local barley to produce native spirits). Due to the rise of commerce after the war, there arose a need for commercial finance, which led to the emergence of many banks and commercial houses. The banking and commercial sectors are both controlled by people from other places. The former is dominated by the Zhenjiang gang, while the latter is dominated by the Wuxi gang. There is only one Anmin Bank, which has recently been closed. There are about 18 money houses. Electricity is charged based on the number and brightness of lights. To prevent users from secretly replacing lights with stronger ones without reporting it, seals are placed on the lights. Recently, due to a shortage of coal, electricity supply has been suspended for a month, so oil lamps have become popular.

Commodity prices in various places along the Jingwu Line are more stable than those along the Jinghu Line. In early May, the price of rice there was 38,000 yuan per picul, meat was over 600 yuan per catty, chicken was 7-800 yuan per catty, duck was 6-700 yuan per catty, sesame oil (i.e., rapeseed oil) was hundreds of yuan, chicken eggs were 40 yuan each, duck eggs were 50 yuan each, water chestnuts were 80 yuan per catty, and sesame pancakes and fried dough sticks were 20 yuan each, which is roughly equivalent in quality to the 30 yuan pieces in Nanjing. Only rent is quite high recently, with an ordinary room costing 3-5,000 yuan, and the deposit being tens of thousands of yuan, mainly because the population has increased sharply and the supply of housing is unable to meet demand, compounded by the stimulation of general commodity prices.

The ticket prices had only increased a few days before the black marketeers in the car resumed their prosperity. On the day I left Dangtu, I arrived at the station early and carefully observed those black marketeers who made a lot of money through regional price differences and the clandestine flow of goods. On this day, no less than 70-80 people were taking goods from Dangtu to the capital, some carrying baskets filled with 10-20 chickens, ducks, eggs, fresh broad beans, etc., others carrying bags filled with grain, water chestnuts, etc., and some carrying rapeseed oil or Biao Core Paper.

The public security in Dangtu is particularly good, and incidents of special forces oppressing the common people are not commonly seen. The common people live in peace and prosperity. County Magistrate Zhang Silang participated in the organization of the local autonomy association at the beginning of the incident, then served as the director of the police bureau, and has recently been promoted to county magistrate. He has always led a group of well-trained and equipped police officers, fulfilling their duty to protect the territory and ensure the safety of the people. Every day, the police are seen marching through the streets in the morning and evening, holding guns, singing military songs, with high morale, which is by no means comparable to ordinary police officers whose minds are occupied with trying to extract some extra money from inspecting travelers.

The strict prohibition of opium, gambling, and prostitution best represents the achievements of the local administration. First, let's talk about opium: for opium dens, a phased closure method is adopted, gradually reducing the number of establishments. On the one hand, the number of opium lamps in opium dens is restricted, and it is stipulated that business hours cannot exceed 9:00 PM. With this layer of restriction, opium dens that mainly operate at night are even more difficult to exist. Now is the last phase of restricting the establishment of opium dens. Soon, no places openly selling and smoking opium will be found in Dangtu. Southern Anhui is a producing area of opium. In the past, the administrative authorities relied on opium poppy donations to benefit both the public and private sectors, but the eradication of opium poppies has been carried out vigorously in this area recently. At the same time, slogans prohibiting the planting of opium poppies are also seen in restaurants and public places, one of which reads: "If my county magistrate asks you to collect opium poppy donations, you common people should rise up and beat me to death and punish me for what I deserve." Regarding prostitution, it was prevalent from the 30th to the 32nd year of the Republic of China, and countless young people were addicted to it. Since the reform of the new county administration, this trend has greatly subsided, and there are no more open prostitutes or prostitute-like people appearing. Gambling in Dangtu is quite well-known in Jiangnan. It was particularly rampant at the beginning of this year, but due to strict prohibition, all gambling except for family entertainment with mahjong has almost disappeared.

Under the current situation of commodity prices, a large number of beggars naturally arise in various cities, but here, apart from finding a few beggars outside the station, they are simply not seen on the streets. Local people say: Beggars and vagrants are not allowed to stand here. As for the disposal of these parasitic groups, it varies depending on age and other circumstances. Those who are elderly and disabled are mostly recruited into charitable organizations such as relief homes, and young vagrants are forced to do hard labor, while those deeply addicted to drugs are generally expelled from the territory.

Finally, let's talk about agriculture. There are more than one million mu of cultivated land, and the currently assessed tax is over 630,000 mu. Due to the Yijiang, polder fields account for seven-tenths of the total. Under the unified government orders of the province, land taxes have been collected in kind since last year. The promotion of agricultural production increase is almost entirely managed by the cooperative system, but if the current fundamental policy of production increase cannot be revised to shift from farmers passively increasing production to farmers automatically increasing production, I am always afraid that it will be empty and lack concrete results.

Dangtu was designated as one of the township construction experimental counties last year, shouldering the important mission of rural construction, but the township construction work is not very visible on the surface for the time being. Recently, the Rural Construction School, which is being run by the Rural Construction Implementation Committee there, is actively recruiting farmers and preparing to start school.

Although Dangtu is crowned with the name of a township construction experimental county, it is actually qualified to be called a model county in terms of political affairs.

### Japanese Army Secures Various Strongholds in Luzon

Tokyo, 13th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - In the Luzon area, Japanese army units continue to secure various strongholds, causing heavy casualties to the enemy, and the front lines have not changed significantly. In the north, Baguio is secured, and fierce battles are currently underway in the suburbs. Fierce bloody battles are also taking place near the mountain ridges of Palawan Island. In the Mindanao area, the fighting in the Davao area is intensifying. Enemy forces that landed near Cotabato on April 19th invaded Davao on the 12th of this month. The Japanese army has now established a long-term combat posture, and morale is extremely high. Since the beginning of May, over 1,750 enemy soldiers have been eliminated and over 60 tanks have been destroyed in a week, achieving great results.

### Java Localities Establish Advisory Councils

Jakarta, 13th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese military administration, in order to adapt the royal fiefdoms to wartime administration for the decisive battle, has decided to establish advisory councils in the royal fiefdoms with the same nature as those in the various provinces.  It has been decided to first establish advisory councils in Surakarta and Mangkunegara, and on the 10th, the "Advisory Council for Royal Fiefdoms" and its implementing regulations were promulgated.  In these newly established advisory councils, members are appointed by the military administration and the two kings of Surakarta and Mangkunegara, as well as elected members (all with a one-year term).  The convening of the advisory councils will be decided through consultation between the two kings.

### Remaining German Troops Completely Eliminated

Stockholm, 13th (Central News Agency) - According to American dispatches, the fighting in Europe has effectively ceased since the resistance of German troops in Czechoslovakia and Latvia ended.

### Trusteeship Issue: Soviet Union Proposes Amendments - Another Obstacle for the San Francisco Conference

Tokyo, 13th (Central News Agency) - According to a Reuters correspondent in San Francisco, the Soviet delegation at the San Francisco Conference suddenly presented amendments to the American proposal for a colonial trusteeship system, giving the Soviet Union the power to veto the American plan to establish strategic bases in the Pacific.  According to the American plan, a trusteeship council would be established, and all countries holding trusteeships could attend the council.  The Soviet plan, however, is to amend these regulations so that all permanent members of the world security organization, regardless of whether they hold trusteeships, would have a permanent seat on the council.  In other words, since the United States, Britain, and France already hold trusteeships, the Soviet Union should also have the right to attend the council.  The American plan would allow countries holding trusteeships to request the Security Council to approve their designated strategic base areas, while the Soviet plan would authorize the Security Council to designate the strategic base areas of various countries and insists that the self-determination and independence of the people in all colonies and mandated territories are the only two goals of the trusteeship system.

### Security Council Members Determined to be Eleven

Lisbon, 13th (Central News Agency) - A dispatch from San Francisco states that the Credentials Committee of the Security Council of the San Francisco Conference voted on the 12th by a majority of 36 votes in favor of the original Dumbarton Oaks proposal to have eleven members on the Security Council.  The proposal by Australia and other small and medium-sized countries to increase the number of council members to fourteen or fifteen in order to prevent the dictatorship of major powers has failed.

### Report of Himmler's Arrest Unconfirmed

Lisbon, 13th (Central News Agency) - A dispatch from Paris states that the Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force announced on the 12th that a detailed follow-up investigation by the Headquarters of the Twenty-First Army Group of the British Army has determined that the rumor that Himmler was arrested near the Dönitz headquarters in the Danish border area is purely groundless.

### After the Issuance of Gold Certificates, the Movement Trends of Idle Capital, Financial Markets Gradually Stabilized Last Week

The financial and industrial market conditions in Shanghai have shown little significant change in the past week. Although the international situation in Europe has shifted, East Asia has not been significantly affected. Moreover, coinciding with the Central Bank's commencement of issuing gold certificates, the movement trends of idle capital have shifted, with investment in gold certificates absorbing funds. Speculation in national bonds and stocks has decreased. Furthermore, those merchants previously engaged in trading gold in the market have been dealt a heavy blow by the low-price issuance of gold certificates and have lost interest in purchasing gold on the black market. Therefore, the black market price of gold fluctuated between 90 and 80 yuan from Monday to Saturday, with a difference of only 10 yuan, unlike the previous week's strange phenomenon of dramatic surges and plunges. National bonds have also stabilized along with the price of gold, with minimal fluctuations. Among stocks, popular stocks such as China-America, Wing On Company, and yarn factories saw calm trading during the first half of the week. Although price increases and decreases were mixed and varied, the fluctuations remained within a limited range, and the trend of reaching the daily price limits has significantly decreased compared to before. The silver tael and silver dollar markets were even more lackluster. Although the money market has become significantly looser than before, the Central Bank and the Clearing House for Banks and Money Shops continue to be extremely cautious in lending funds to fellow institutions. Therefore, the speculative atmosphere has gradually subsided naturally. The cash positions of various financial institutions have been adequately regulated by the Central Bank, and their operations have gradually become more flexible. Restrictions on customer withdrawals of cash have been slightly eased, and the interest rates for underground lending and discounting bills by small banks and money shops have been reduced significantly. Overall, the financial situation has trended towards normalcy and stability due to the issuance of gold certificates.

Regarding industry and commerce, conditions have been generally calm. The danger of stimulating a sharp rise in prices seems to have gradually disappeared after the issuance of gold certificates, as abundant idle capital now has a legitimate investment channel. The authorities are strictly enforcing measures to crack down on hoarding, such as strengthening trade associations and improving their structure, and registering major commodities through the Economic Bureau, to suppress prices. Merchants dare not arbitrarily hoard materials. On the other hand, they are actively adjusting the supply of industrial electricity, increasing production, and improving transportation and traffic to unclog the sources of materials. Therefore, people's minds are at ease. In the past week, except for a slight increase in rice prices, the market prices of other major commodities, such as coarse grains, oil grains, and coal, have trended towards stability.

### Zhao Xuanzhang Inspects Central News Agency Shanghai Branch Yesterday

Director Zhao of the Ministry of Information of the National Government, believing that the Central News Agency's mission has become even more significant since its reorganization into a public welfare organization, and also due to Zhao's concurrent role as Chairman of the Board, has been particularly concerned about the general situation of the headquarters and branches. Taking advantage of his official trip to Shanghai, he made a special visit to the Shanghai branch at 9:30 PM last night. Director Cha of the branch accompanied him on a tour of various departments and reported on the work situation. Zhao praised the efforts of all colleagues and left the branch at 10:30 PM.

### Urgent Need for Coal Supply

The source of coal in the city has long become a major problem for industrial production. The authorities of the Ministry of Industries are actively coordinating the efforts to unclog the source of coal. According to a reporter's information from mining industry figures yesterday, China has abundant coal resources in many areas. Unfortunately, they have not been fully exploited in the past, so a portion of coal from Annam and India has been used. After the war, due to various reasons, the work in all the major coal mines under development has been intermittent, and the skills of the workers are also relatively different. The insufficient supply of coal is also one of the reasons. In addition, there have been some problems in transportation recently. Coal stored in the production areas is piled up like mountains and cannot be transported out smoothly, which has a significant impact on production and increased production and deserves special attention. If the authorities can find ways to facilitate water and land transportation in North and Central China as soon as possible and further promote mining work, then the coal resources of famous coal mines such as Kailuan, Zhongxing, Huainan, Jingxing, Zhongfu, Mantoushan, and Mentougou can be self-sufficient within the possible savings, and the quantity of military and civilian needs can also be met without worrying about shortages.

### Regulations on Depositing and Paying Negotiable Instruments by Banks and Money Shops

The Shanghai Banks and Money Shops Association previously, in order to save manpower and material resources due to the increasing number of negotiable instruments received and paid by fellow institutions, has negotiated a new method for handling mutual collection of negotiable instruments, which was officially implemented from the first of this month. Recently, according to information learned from the financial sector, the Silver Union Association and Qianzhun Bank have now decided on the method of depositing and paying negotiable instruments, which will be implemented within days. The method is roughly as follows: For example, when a money shop receives negotiable instruments of exchange banks and related agent exchange banks deposited by customers, the receiving money shop will directly send them to the Silver Union Association, which will collect the instruments on behalf of the Qianzhun Bank. At the same time, when a bank receives negotiable instruments payable by money shops, the bank will directly send them to the Qianzhun Bank, which will collect the accounts on behalf of the Silver Union Association. Afterwards, the two association banks will reconcile accounts with each other. As for returned instruments, the old method will still be used.

### A Record of Bone-Deep Lung Treatment

— Lu Guanliu

Pulmonary tuberculosis is truly one of the most stubborn and terrifying diseases. Those afflicted with this ailment almost universally recognize it as a cause for discouragement and despair. However, in this age of advanced medicine, as long as early diagnosis is possible and appropriate treatment is pursued, it is not beyond cure.

Currently, this dreadful disease is rapidly spreading in cities, taking advantage of the hardships of wartime life and nutritional deficiencies. Most families of the salaried class are facing its invisible threat. As someone who works in the education sector, I am of course among the salaried class. Unfortunately, my wife contracted pulmonary tuberculosis. I am recording the treatment process faithfully, in the hope that it may be of some benefit to those who are currently entangled by tuberculosis bacteria.

My wife is an elementary school teacher. On one hand, she must undertake the laborious teaching duties at school, and on the other hand, she must take care of the busy chores at home. Therefore, tuberculosis bacteria took advantage of the opportunity to invade. Last autumn, she occasionally suffered from a cold and cough, which gradually progressed to a persistent fever. After a doctor's examination and X-ray inspection, it was confirmed that it was indeed tuberculosis. We then sought treatment from a pulmonologist. Because the disease progressed very quickly, medication and injections did not stop its progression. Later, it was discovered that there was already a cavity in the upper corner of her right lung. She was hospitalized and received several air injections, but to no avail. Fortunately, a friend introduced us to Dr. Gu Kaizhi, the head of the surgery department at Shanghai Nanyang Hospital, who was known for his skillful rib resection surgery and rich experience. Therefore, we decided to seek treatment at his hospital.

After being admitted to the hospital, an X-ray was taken first. Then, Dr. Gu Kaizhi, in consultation with a pulmonary specialist, determined the location and number of ribs to be resected. Next, the doctor examined her stool, urine, blood, and all parts of her body to determine if she was suitable for surgery. Thorough disinfection and injections were also required before the operation. Because of such careful pre-operative examination and thorough disinfection, post-operative complications were rare.

It is said that Dr. Gu often tossed and turned in bed the night before surgery, carefully studying and planning in detail. During the operation, he was even more focused and nervous. Furthermore, because he could carefully observe the physiological condition during the operation, inflammation, pain, and unexpected changes rarely occurred. My wife underwent her first surgery on February 22nd. Because there was no electricity during the day, it had to be performed at night. A total of four ribs were resected, and the surgery was completed within an hour. When the patient woke up late at night, she was still asking if the surgery had been performed, because general anesthesia was used during the surgery, and the patient did not feel any pain at all. After about three days, she gradually felt relaxed, and her appetite gradually returned. A week later, the incision was to be stitched up. But because my wife's affected area was at the fifth rib, she had to undergo a second surgery a month later.

The second surgery was performed on the night of March 30th, during which three ribs were resected. Because the location of the second rib resection was sequentially lower, it was more convenient and took less time than the first, and the patient's pain was also less than the first time. The next day, she was already able to drink some liquid foods. Although her physical condition was weaker, all her reactions were better than the first time. A month later, an X-ray examination showed that the diseased lung was completely compressed and the bacteria had no room to move. Therefore, with the doctor's permission, she returned home to recuperate.

When discharged from the hospital, because the expenses were too great and beyond our means, we received help from Mr. Gu Nanqun and Mr. Lu Jianyai, and the hospital provided special treatment and subsidies from the medical loan office. Their sympathy for poor teachers is worthy of gratitude.

Although she is still in the recovery period, her condition is very different from before the surgery. Because the disease no longer shows signs of progressing, and the patient's spirit is no longer threatened, her spirit and physical strength will naturally recover quickly.

This experience of my wife's lung disease treatment has given me several valuable lessons. First of all, if a person has suspected symptoms of the disease, they should quickly go for an X-ray examination. If it can be detected early, appropriate treatment can be given immediately, and it can definitely be cured quickly. Many people are afraid of examinations because they fear that the discovery of lung disease will cause them mental terror. This is truly an attitude of "nurturing a tiger and leaving behind trouble," which is absolutely undesirable. Because if you wait until the disease is deeply rooted before seeking treatment, it will not only cost money, but it will also be too dangerous.

Secondly, if after examination, you have been diagnosed with lung disease, except for very mild cases that can be cured by rest, if the disease is progressing rapidly, it is best to immediately receive air injections, because air injections are both economical and effective. Furthermore, there is no pain and absolutely no danger. It is truly a simple and effective treatment for early-stage diseases.

As for those who already have cavities and air injections are ineffective, then they only have to choose between rest and rib resection. However, the old-fashioned rest cure is originally a palliative treatment, and its dangers are too great. Because there are many people who spend a lot of time resting but make the disease worse, to the point of being incurable. If you hire an experienced surgeon to resect the ribs, the danger is much less. Some people are afraid of the pain of surgery, which is really unnecessary. "When a snake bites, a brave man cuts off his wrist." To deal with stubborn and terrible tuberculosis bacteria, one must have the greatest determination. In this 20th century, where medical progress is advancing by leaps and bounds, we should sincerely believe in new medical treatments.

"Lung disease is not a terminal illness." I sincerely hope that everyone suffering from tuberculosis can receive appropriate treatment and regain their health!
