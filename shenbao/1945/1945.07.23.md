### War Situation in Various Parts of East Asia

Tokyo, 22nd (Central News Agency Telegram) - The war situation in various parts of East Asia over the past week is as follows:

Southwest Pacific Area: At Palmyra and Tanahmerah, since the enemy troops landed on June 25th, the Japanese army has thoroughly attacked them, inflicting heavy damage and suppressing the northern area. The mopping up of the remaining enemy forces was completed by the 18th. In the Balikpapan area, fierce battles continued from last week. By the end of the week, enemy attacks had become passive, and both sides were in a standoff on all fronts.

Bougainville and New Guinea Area: Japanese army units continued to fight bravely, especially the Japanese army on Bougainville Island, which overcame all adverse conditions and countered the stubborn attacks of the enemy, achieving considerable battle results. Last month, the Japanese army invaded the enemy's territory on the right bank of the Mono River in the southern part of Bougainville Island. By the 10th, they had killed or wounded 915 enemy soldiers, destroyed 9 tanks, 3 vehicles, and 27 barracks.

Central Bougainville Island Area: There were no major changes on the front lines. In the northern area, the Japanese army continued to advance on the Sammy-U Hill with a part of its forces. While attacking along the river, they repelled 400-500 enemy soldiers. On the 10th, they broke into Tafu, where the enemy left 168 corpses. In addition, in the New Guinea area, in the Kurau-Ewa area, the Japanese army crushed the offensive of the Australian 6th Division. From the beginning of last month to the 30th, it was confirmed that the enemy suffered approximately 1,500 personnel casualties and another 1,600 wounded.

Burma Area: Japanese army units in the Xitan River estuary area crossed the river and launched an offensive on the west bank. On the dawn of the 9th, they recaptured the enemy positions at Mekase, Micheku, and Uma, and have since secured them. The Japanese side achieved battle results, killing or wounding more than 1,000 enemy soldiers and shooting down two enemy aircraft, capturing five artillery pieces, ten heavy and light machine guns, eight trucks, and other weapons and ammunition. In the Kalaw area, enemy forces gradually continued to advance southward, and the intensity of the Burmese war increased daily.

### American Lineup in Preparation for the Decisive Battle

Tokyo, 22nd (Central News Agency Telegram) - In order to expand its strategic effects, the enemy United States has deployed its newly formed mobile units, cruising in the Japanese near sea, implementing bombing and shelling, seeking to take advantage of opportunities. It intends to deploy its aircraft carrier fleet to deplete the Japanese air force and take advantage of gaps in the Japanese army in the hope of ending the war in one fell swoop. This is the enemy's clear operational intention. In preparation for this final decisive battle, the enemy's frontline lineup has recently undergone significant personnel changes in the land, sea, and air forces. Experienced officers from the European and Greater East Asia Wars have been deployed to the front lines, hoping to use them to deal with the Japanese mainland operation in case of emergency. For example, after the death of General Buckner, commander of the enemy's Tenth Army on Okinawa, Stilwell was transferred to succeed him as commander of the Tenth Army. Stilwell had been in contact with the Japanese army on the mainland for a long time, so he was one of the most knowledgeable people about the Japanese army. If the enemy attempts a landing operation in China or an attack on Japan, this person would be a good commander for the landing force. Second, in preparation for the landing, the enemy is conducting a large-scale strategic bombing attack. In order to streamline operations with a large number of air forces, a new Twentieth Air Force in the Mariana Islands was established and transferred to the Pacific Strategic Air Force, which, together with the Eighth Air Force, which was transferred from Europe under Lieutenant General Trider, is under the command of Commander General Spaatz. Spaatz was responsible for bombing Germany, and Trider also commanded it. Now, together with Ramey in the Mariana Islands, they are jointly conducting air attacks on Japan. In addition, in order to increase the efficiency of the supply line, which is the most difficult hurdle, a new US Western and Central Pacific Supply Command was established with Lieutenant Generals Stanley Ritcheson as commanders. This is the most noteworthy personnel composition. Indeed, the alliance between Nimitz and MacArthur remains the same, and the corresponding deployment of Mountbatten and Hullett remains unchanged. Observing the enemy's encircling headquarters personnel against Japan, it is clear that the enemy's operational intentions are to persevere against the tenacious brains. Supreme Commander of the Southwest Pacific Allied Forces, Marshal MacArthur; Commander of the Sixth Army (Philippines), Lieutenant General Kruger; Commander of the Eighth Army (Philippines), Lieutenant General Baega; Commander of the Tenth Army (Okinawa), General Stilwell; Supreme Commander of the Southeast Asia Allied Forces, Marshal Mountbatten; Commander of the Ground Forces, Lieutenant General Olive Allis; Air Force Commander, Lieutenant General Ospaihua; Commander of the Pacific Strategic Air Force, General Spaatz; Commander of the Eighth Air Force (Okinawa), Lieutenant General Trider; Commander of the Twentieth Air Force (Mariana Islands), Major General Ramey; Commander of the Far East Air Force Tactical Air Force, General Melli Na; Commander of the Fifth Air Force (Okinawa), Lieutenant General Hait; Commander of the Seventh Air Force (Okinawa), Major General Douglas; Commander of the Thirteenth Air Force (New Guinea), Brigadier General Penz. Commander of the Pacific Fleet, General Spruance; Commander of the Fifth Fleet, General Kingcate; Commander of the Ninth Fleet, Vice Admiral Fleischer; Commander of the Aircraft Carrier Mobile Force, Vice Admiral Takudz; Commander of the Fast Aircraft Carrier Mobile Force, Rear Admiral Shiameng; Commander of the Amphibious Force, Vice Admiral Gai Ka; Commander of the Submarine Fleet, Rear Admiral Lockut. Army Commander of the Alaskan Region, Lieutenant General Amos; Commander of the First Air Force, Major General Purk; Army Commander of the Mariana Island Area, Lieutenant General Malay; Army Commander of the China Region, Lieutenant General Island Die Meier; Air Force Commander, Lieutenant General Streamier; Commander-in-Chief of the British Fleet Pacific Fleet, General Hullett; Commander-in-Chief of the East Indian Ocean Fleet, General Butt.

### Italian Prime Minister Denies Participation in the Pacific War

Lisbon, 22nd (Central News Agency Telegram) - According to a Rome report, Italian Prime Minister Barri recently denied reports that an Italian government expeditionary force was preparing to participate in the Pacific War.

### Eliminating British and American Encroaching Forces and Opening up a Bright Future for East Asia: Speech by Captain Matsumoto at a Cultural Lecture

The strategic actions taken by the enemy United States in the Battle of Okinawa, and Japan's special attack tactics, have drawn close attention from the world. The enemy's current air war involves the blind bombing of cities in various parts of the Japanese mainland by B-29s taking off from the Mariana Islands base, and attempts to destroy the industrial areas and sea and land transportation lines of Japan, as well as tactical bombing by mobile unit aircraft. On the other hand, the reorganization of the personnel of the US Army and Navy, especially the transfer of naval forces on the front lines, shows that the enemy United States is preparing for the next phase of operations. As for the movement of enemy forces in Europe, although the enemy boasts that they are being moved successively, they must pass through India or the enemy's home country to reach East Asia. Therefore, the enemy's future large-scale decisive battle will only be implemented after the movement is completed. The enemy currently claims that only the first stage has been completed since the start of operations. The goal of this stage is to attempt to control the air supremacy over the Japanese mainland in order to measure Japan's air force strength. The second stage is to attempt to disrupt the transportation between the Japanese mainland and the mainland, as well as the land transportation lines within Japan. The third stage of the enemy attempts to seize strategically important points in Japan and land on the mainland to disperse and isolate Japan's military strength.

### The Decisive Battle Between Japan and the United States Must Await Next Spring

However, judging from the enemy's intentions, the first stage has not yet been completed. The start time of the decisive battle between Japan and the United States must be in October of this year, and the large-scale decisive battle in the first phase must await next spring, April or May, before it can be launched. The destination of the enemy's decisive battle cannot be determined at this time. This is because the enemy has not yet decided on a strategic goal. As the commander of the enemy's Seventh Fleet, Kindert, stated, "My brain is not good now. The US military should attack Tokyo directly." Pacific Fleet Commander Nimitz also stated: "It is advantageous for the US to land on the Japanese mainland." At the same time, the London Times also argued that it is more advantageous for the US military to land on the Japanese mainland than to operate on the mainland, as the mainland is not the main decisive battle but only an auxiliary battle.

Since Japan [illegible], it has completed its preparations with all its might [illegible] and has grasped the lessons learned from the Battle of Okinawa and is working hard to expand them [illegible], and Japan's special attack tactics can especially exert their effect, leaving the enemy helpless. In the past operations on Okinawa Island, enemy US military commentators also stated: "The US military suffered more naval losses than land and air forces in this operation, which was actually caused by Japan's special attack tactics." At the same time, Nimitz and enemy military and political authorities all said they could not cope. In addition, Japan can also use mountainous areas to build strong positions. Japan has many mountains, and using mountains to form strong positions, coupled with the spirit of special attacks, will give the enemy who comes to Japan a considerable invitation to strike. The enemy has also stated: "The concentration of Japanese aircraft is at least 9,000 to 10,000." Recently, the strategic bombing of the mobile unit air force has also failed to reduce that force, and Japan is also using underground factories and dispersed factory production, increasing monthly production by more than 1,500 aircraft. Both production and storage are unusually abundant, and it is said that Japan will fight with all its strength in the decisive battle.

### The Soviet Union's Concerns about the Fate of East Asia

Secondly, the international situation [illegible]. Recently, Chongqing [illegible] President [illegible] Ziwen went to the Soviet Union to visit Stalin and held many talks. Later, due to the convening of the tripartite conference of Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union, it ended in vain. Although this meeting between Truman, Churchill, and Stalin discussed issues such as the handling of Germany and European borders, the fate of Greater East Asia was also discussed. The fate of Greater East Asia was also discussed. This tripartite conference took peace as its premise and prepared for the peace conference to be held in two years, but how will the Soviet Union adopt its current attitude? In the past San Francisco conference, the results were formed in form due to the nature and characteristics of Britain and the United States, but in this meeting, there was also an impact due to the relationship in character. Moreover, the Soviet Union has a strong national character and is the national character of East Asia, so no matter how the meeting goes, we should not be pessimistic. It is deeply believed that the Soviet Union is also giving serious consideration to the fate of East Asia, and the operations of the Japanese and American armies are [illegible] in a turbulent state and are becoming increasingly fierce.

### The Path to Open the Dangerous Situation

At this time when the war situation is changing and the world situation is developing, what should we think? What goals should we move towards? Where is the path we should take? Regarding this voice, I do not want to simply choose a path as the best way and force you to take it. Now I will present a fact that may be used as a method of thinking and reflecting.

At the beginning of the 19th century, when Napoleon's iron hooves ravaged Berlin, the German philosopher Fichte was still lecturing on the necessity of ethnic education in his "Addresses to the German Nation" in the university church with the sound of cannons booming. It can be asserted that Fichte's German idealism philosophy laid the foundation for the century-long prosperity of Germany before World War I.

Now Japan has encountered unprecedented national difficulties, and people of insight are deeply considering how to open up the dangerous situation. General Yamashita, the supreme commander in the Philippines, once advocated "improving the educational level of the Japanese people" on Lyz島. The wealthy man, Tokutomi, also expressed fierce opinions, hoping that the youth would rise up. Recently, General Ishihara strenuously advocated the emperor's direct rule and domestic reform. Although Japan is in this crisis, it is igniting a true torch of reform, and the special attack spirit of dying for the country is making the future of reform brilliant and bright.

Looking at the current situation in China, after eight years of the War of Resistance, the three government grains are standing up, creating a chaotic state, secretly stirring the case, not knowing what they want, and seem to want to open up a path to a modern country. You, who are responsible for the important task of China in the future, also hope for a modern and unified China in your hearts. However, the current situation in China and Japan can be reflected in the context of world history. China and Japan are behind in the development of capitalism and are also behind in the road to modernization. Therefore, in the past fifty or even one hundred years, China, Japan, and Sino-Japanese relations have repeatedly suffered tragic misfortunes. This is certainly the case, lagging behind others on the road to modernization, and the fact of backward capitalism, is this a tragic fate for China and Japan? I can answer:

This world war is opening up a promising path for us. I now have the following thoughts, I don't know what you think?

### Persist in Hope Without the Slightest Relaxation

In a sense, the nineteenth century can be regarded as the era of liberalism, nationalism, and nationalism, which had already bred the seeds of imperialism and created World War I. Due to World War I, everyone had a deep impression of the destruction and misery of the war, so mankind loved peace, and internationalism and cosmopolitanism began to rise. But the reality of the world is by no means singular, and there are many situations that are too complicated. However, this kind of cosmopolitanism that deviates from reality is of course inevitable for World War II. According to my observation, this war bears a historical task, which is to end nationalism and cosmopolitanism dialectically in the economic, political, and social fields in order to realize the idea of ​​regionalism and co-prosperity.

During the six years of the war, the war situation has changed dramatically, and the form of the co-prosperity sphere has changed several times, but the rise of regionalism is believed to be an inevitable historical trend. Standing on this position, I thought of the East Asian regional sphere based on the common consciousness of China and Japan, eliminating the white people's domination of East Asia, wiping out the erosion of Europe and the United States on East Asia, and opening up the way for China and Japan to refer to it, and we could see the dawn of East Asia.

Today, the war situation is extremely harsh, and the world situation is changing. The reality of East Asia cannot but be said to be the most profound tragedy. However, under the heavy pressure of this harsh reality, we must go far beyond the war situation and cross the distance of the coup. Conversely, the more miserable the reality, the more we should have hope for the distant other side. We now feel that "the day is late, and the road is still far." Being oppressed by reality is almost suffocating, but hope should always be persisted without the slightest relaxation, and I believe that those who work tirelessly will surely have light shining on them.

Editorial

### The Chongqing Political Council and the National Assembly Issue

The first session of the fourth National Political Council in Chongqing opened on July 7th and closed on July 20th. During this period, a total of nineteen meetings were held. Among them, ten were reports on the administration of the various ministries of the government, and only nine were formal deliberations.

In the reporting sector, the stern questions from the council members can reflect the public's dissatisfaction with the recent administration in Chongqing. Among them, finance and economy and diplomacy were the most criticized, and there were many problems with the reports of the conscription, internal affairs, social, agriculture, and forestry ministries, which the authorities could not answer. What is more noteworthy is Chen Cheng's military report and the so-called preparation for the general counter-offensive, which shows that Chongqing is still trying to use the names of the general counter-offensive to restore people's hearts.

In the deliberation sector, the "Please approve the United Nations Constitution" and "Please conduct the trial and conclude the military alliance treaty between China, Britain, the Soviet Union, and France" were passed. The former is nothing more than a timely document to adapt to the new international situation, and the latter is inevitably too empty. In addition, issues such as improving conscription, improving the treatment of officers and soldiers, post-war national reconstruction, and developing industrial production are nothing more than repeating the resolutions that the Political Council had previously passed.

This Chongqing Political Council can be said to be the dimmest since the Political Council was established. First of all, the Communist Party members refused to attend. Although the government persuaded the neutral Huang Yanpei and others to go to lobby, the result was still ineffective; not only was it ineffective, but Huang Yanpei and other neutral parties took the opportunity to have direct talks with the CCP leaders, and a certain degree of tacit understanding was established between the CCP and the third force, namely the Democratic League. Therefore, when Huang and others returned to Chongqing, some members of the third force also expressed their refusal to attend. Although Huang reluctantly participated in a meeting in the end "in order to take into account the necessity of the National Assembly and the participation of all parties and factions" and "had to sacrifice his own opinions", he still declared that he "strongly disagreed with the report of the Political Council's Shenhui Committee on the National Assembly" to show his reserved position. This is rare in this Political Council. At least, Chongqing's use of the Political Council to flaunt its democracy to China and foreign countries has failed.

The reason for the failure of this Political Council lies in the issue of the National Assembly, and the reason why the council members' opinions on this issue are so inconsistent is superficially because the date of the meeting is set for November 12 this year, which is too hasty, and the result is inevitable to pass the constitution hastily, which is unfaithful to the future of the country, the people, and democracy. Secondly, as for the representatives of the National Assembly, the government maintains in principle the personnel appointed by the Kuomintang before the incident. Now, after eight or nine years, the situation and personnel have undergone great changes, which is very different from the meaning of true people's representatives. Now the Political Council has passed the report according to the examination report, that is, the date is entrusted to the government to carefully stipulate according to the actual situation, and another compromise method is set for the election of representatives of the National Assembly. Therefore, November 12 will inevitably be too late to hold.

In order to confront the Chongqing's convocation of the National Assembly, the CCP also has preparations to convene the so-called "People's Representative Assembly of the Liberated Areas of China" in Yan'an on a regular basis. The scale and method seem to be in opposition to Chongqing, but the specific goals of this meeting have not been announced. In addition to confronting Chongqing and showing the infighting in the War of Resistance camp, what other practical significance does it have? However, we must point out that our country's vitality is so impaired that it really cannot withstand the powerful people playing with the children's plays and the bloody civil war again and again!

### Northern Jiangsu Area: War Results of Japanese Mopping-Up

Central News Agency dispatch: Recently, the Yan'an forces in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River have gradually moved south, and the New Fourth Army has also become increasingly active in various places. The Japanese army is currently attacking them everywhere in order to thwart their attempts.

Furthermore, starting from June 5th, they attacked the Jingjiang Independent Regiment, which consisted of approximately 2,000 men. Since the beginning of this year, they have continued to suppress the forces of the Yan'an army in various locations. In addition, with the imminent timing of the U.S. military's landing operation on Okinawa Island, the Japanese army is also rapidly preparing for defensive warfare. On May 1st, the Japanese army carried out a mopping-up operation against the 23rd Regiment of the Huaihai Sub-district and local bandit forces near the northern border of Huaihai Province. By May 22nd, they had destroyed the guerrilla bases in the area.

### Churchill Inspects British Troops in Berlin

Stockholm, Sweden, 22nd, Central News Agency telegram: According to news from Berlin: British Prime Minister Churchill personally inspected the British and American troops yesterday (three regiments of British troops participating in the war). They paraded on the streets of Berlin, Charlottenburg, and Unter den Linden. General Montgomery, General Lyne, Foreign Secretary Eden, and Labor Party leader Attlee accompanied Prime Minister Churchill in the inspection.

### Potsdam Conference Reaches Critical Moment: Deliberations Progress Extremely Rapidly

Stockholm, Sweden, 22nd, Central News Agency telegram: According to a U.S. representative in Potsdam, who spoke last night, the three great powers have been holding daily talks since Thursday, typically lasting three hours. At the same time, the foreign ministers and various committee members of the three countries are also working actively under the same direction.

Stockholm, Sweden, 22nd, Central News Agency telegram: According to a Reuters diplomatic correspondent, although there is no official confirmation, observations from well-informed sources in London suggest that the three-party talks currently taking place in Potsdam may temporarily conclude this weekend, so that British Prime Minister Churchill and Labor Party leader Attlee can return to London temporarily next Thursday to learn the results of the general election. However, other speculations suggest that even if Truman, Churchill, and Stalin return to their respective countries, the talks will not be temporarily suspended, as there are still major issues that need to be decided by them.

Stockholm, Sweden, 22nd, Central News Agency telegram: According to news from Berlin: A U.S. representative participating in the Potsdam Conference made a powerful statement yesterday, revealing that the conference's progress is extremely rapid, and also pointing out that the conference has now reached a critical moment. The main points are as follows: The three-party conference is proceeding continuously, and extremely serious issues are currently under discussion. How to deal with Germany and the future of Germany will be the top priority of these important issues. The heads of the three countries are making efforts to eliminate all difficulties in order to find a proper solution to the issues concerning all of Germany and even all of Europe. Experts specializing in the study of war-defeated countries' responsibility for compensation for losses all hold extremely important positions in this conference. Mr. Lunt, the U.S. wartime shipping administrator who was urgently summoned by President Truman, is also participating in the conference. According to the news released yesterday, Lieutenant General Clay, representing General Eisenhower, had dinner with President Truman last night. Based on this, we can observe that the three great powers will discuss various major issues related to Germany today, and the procedure is approximately as follows:

### Occupation Issues

This is the basic action of occupying German territory. All political observers in Berlin deeply believe that the three great powers are currently still vigorously reviewing the three countries' policies and the individual development of the deformed status quo in the occupation zones, in order to achieve unity.

### Compensation Issues

This is the necessary policy involving the purpose of occupying Germany and the compensation regulations. Regarding this issue, the three great powers are currently encountering two major obstacles: (A) Unless German industrial machinery and commercial markets are restored, Germany will not be able to bear any compensation; (B) If fearing the resurgence of war and reorganizing the entire German industry, Germany will never be able to compensate for losses.

### Military Issues

This is currently the most complex and important issue. In reality, the military governments of Britain and the United States are still an executive government. Currently, the military governments of the two countries are suspending work and waiting for instructions and guidance after the three-party conference.

### U.S. Military Discharges Now Reach 200,000

Lisbon, 22nd, Central News Agency telegram: According to a telegram from New York: U.S. Under Secretary of the Army Patterson stated on the 21st that the U.S. Army returning from Europe is being discharged at a rate of 4,000 men per day.

### Thailand to Implement People's Training

Bangkok, 21st, Central News Agency telegram: The Thai People's Assembly reviewed the government's urgent motion to establish a constitutional amendment review committee on the 19th. After deliberation, it unanimously passed the motion, and the government will immediately appoint 27 members to serve as committee members. Subsequently, it proceeded to review the wartime Thai training bill proposed by the government to implement people's training. As a result, it was decided to transfer it to the next meeting for review. The main purpose of this wartime people's training bill is to require young Thai men aged 20 to 30 to receive military training in the use of modern weapons, with the exception of monks, active-duty soldiers, and active-duty police officers.

### Belgian People All Advocate Supporting the Crown Prince as Regent

Lisbon, 22nd, Central News Agency telegram: According to a dispatch from Brussels: Belgian Prime Minister Achille Van Acker, in a speech to the Lower House on the 20th, impeached King Leopold of Belgium. The Belgian people unanimously advocated supporting Crown Prince Baudouin, who is only fourteen years old this year. Furthermore, the bill on holding a national referendum on the matter of the King's return to the throne was passed on the 20th and will be sent to the Senate soon.

### Soviet Union Persists in Demanding Control of the Tatar Strait from Turkey: Also Seeks to Recover Territory Lost 25 Years Ago

Stockholm, Sweden, 22nd, Central News Agency telegram: According to Reuters correspondent Mr. Holber in Moscow: "The Soviet News Agency today disclosed a piece of news in major Soviet newspapers, stating, 'Marshal Stalin will undoubtedly insist on maintaining the future security of the Tatar Strait.' At the same time, the news also quoted an article written by Christian Science Monitor correspondent Stevens in a certain publication, stating, 'The Soviet authorities' current concern for the Tatar Strait is no less than the U.S. authorities' concern for the Panama Canal.'" Stevens also discussed Kars, which belongs to Armenia, and was ceded to Turkey in 1920, becoming a province of Turkey. However, the Soviet Union suddenly claimed that Kars was part of Soviet Armenia. At the same time, the Soviet authorities also claimed that the Soviet Union would ensure that the demand for merging all regions within Soviet Armenia into one would be supported by most Armenians. Therefore, it is legal for the Soviet Union to demand control of the Tatar Strait. Finally, Stevens issued a warning, stating that Turkey must be careful not to be supported by Britain to organize the so-called "anti-Soviet Turkish-Greek bloc." The Soviet Union's current demand for the return of the Kars, Ardahan, Artvin and other regions is the Soviet Union's due right."

Suburban Correspondence

### Grain Transportation After the Lifting of Restrictions

— Zhicheng

Since the National Government authorities, in view of the soaring rice prices in various places and the deep threat to people's livelihoods, implemented emergency measures to temporarily stop purchasing and abolish movement restrictions, the purpose was to open up rice sources and allow free circulation. After implementation, rice and grain were transported to Shanghai from all directions, and Shanghai rice prices immediately dropped. Recently, all sectors of society have paid attention to the various aspects of the situation after the lifting of restrictions, in order to enrich the people's food and achieve the goal of stabilizing people's livelihoods. Therefore, this reporter was dispatched to the rice-producing areas in the suburbs of Shanghai—Songjiang, Jinshan, Shenjiang, Chuansha, Nanhui, etc.—to investigate. Here is a report on the main points of what I have observed:

### Before and After the Lifting of Restrictions

Before the central government issued the emergency measures for rice and grain, the movement of rice and grain in various places was restricted. In particular, Songjiang and Jinshan were designated as military rice areas, and rice and grain from the countryside could not be moved into the region or city at will, resulting in the price difference between various places and Shanghai always being more than one-third. Moreover, there was also a difference between the east gate and west gate of Songjiang urban area. Therefore, it was often the case that individual porters transported rice to Shanghai in small batches and intermittently through smuggling. Moreover, merchants with abundant capital and influence used their advantages to hoard and speculate, manipulating prices. In the past month, Songjiang rice prices rose from 350,000 to 600,000, Jinshan rose from 380,000 to over 500,000, etc.

After the lifting of restrictions, with free movement and circulation, rice and grain were transported from various places, Shanghai rice prices fell back, and the movement of rice and grain from various rural areas into urban areas also became much smoother, resulting in rice prices in various places falling back one after another. For example, Jinshan fell back from over 500,000 to 400,000, Songjiang fell back from 600,000 to around 500,000, and Minhang fell back from 700,000 to 500,000. However, at this time of year when the old crop has been exhausted and the new crop has not yet arrived, the quantity of rice in various rice-producing areas is limited. Due to the natural trend of exporting, the prices in rice-producing areas (Songjiang) were leveled with those in Shanghai. For example, on the day this reporter left Songjiang (July 11), white rice was priced at 540,000 per shi (small hu, 150 jin per shi). If transported to Shanghai, plus transportation costs, weight difference (Shanghai medium hu, 156 jin per shi), expenses along the way, and the porters' food, the cost would already be around 600,000 when arriving in Caohejing. This is the general situation in the suburbs of Shanghai. However, the situation is slightly different for those coming from railway lines. Therefore, individual porters have changed to purchasing from rice-producing areas (Suzhou, Wuxi, Jiashan, etc.) by railway.

### Transportation Situation

The sources of rice and grain in Shanghai are mostly Changzhou, Wuxi, Changshu, Suzhou, Kunshan, Jiaxing, Jiashan, Qingpu, Songjiang, Jinshan, Fengxian and other counties. According to this reporter, there are approximately the following routes for rice and grain entering Shanghai from rice-producing areas: Songhu Road, Songsih Road, Hu-Min-Nan-Tuo Road, Shangnan Road, Qinghu Road, inland river transport ships, and the Jinghu and Huhang railways. Here is a separate description of each route that this reporter has traveled.

During the time of rice and grain control, rice and grain from Songjiang Qishan and other places were smuggled through small roads due to strict blocking, and transported to Zhoupu. As a result, Zhoupu became a large distribution center for rice and grain. Shangnan Road and Zhoupu to Beicai to Longwangmiao were originally major roads for smuggling rice and grain. After the opening of traffic on May 5th, Songjiang and Jinshan can directly transport rice to Shanghai without having to continue through other routes. Therefore, the amount of rice entering the town has decreased daily. In the past, there were more than 1,000 shi per day, but now there are only about 100 shi. Shangnan Road has instead become the main road for transporting sweet potatoes, flour, and miscellaneous grains to the urban area. According to a private flour seller, "One bag of flour can earn a net profit of 10,000 yuan from Zhanggangzha in Chuansha to Zhoupu, after deducting food expenses."

Returning from Fengxian and passing through Hu-Min-Nan-Tuo Road, I saw many male and female rice porters using buses and bicycles as tools to carry rice from Zhuangjiahang, Nanqiao, Yexie, Zhangze, Wujiaqiao and other places and return. After crossing the river to Minhang, they arrive directly in Shanghai via the highway. Only a few sell in Minhang, about 20 to 30 shi per day. Therefore, most rice shops have switched to operating miscellaneous grains. Each bicycle can carry more than one shi, and the porters only carry one or two dou, making only one trip a day at most. On Hu-Min Road, rice porters come and go endlessly, forming a lifeline for Shanghai's food supply.

Leaving Minhang and taking a bus along Songhu Road to Songjiang, I saw a truck carrying more than ten shi of rice. People and rice each occupied half of the truck. It is said that the freight for this type of truck is very high, about 30,000 yuan per shi, plus a "tip" of 4,000 yuan per shi for the escort to buy wine. If encountering illegal extortion, the truck owner is responsible for dealing with it.

Another route for Songjiang's exports is from Songjiang to Sijing, Qibao, etc., using bicycles, paddle boats, and cars to transfer to Shanghai. The amount transported is about several hundred dan per day. Recently, because railway transportation is smoother, the number of transfers has gradually become flat.

Individual porters who purchase rice from the Jinshan Pinghu area use inland river transport ships to Pinghu as transportation. Every time they arrive at a wharf, the rice porters going up and down are bustling and crowded, as if a large ocean liner has arrived at the port. Both the bottom of the cabin and the top of the deck are filled with bags of rice.

In terms of transportation, transportation tools urgently need to be increased, and transportation agencies should be improved, such as the increase in freight rates, and the "additional reward" for escorts or boaters. In fact, the so-called "additional reward" is tantamount to extortion. Otherwise, they will turn a blind eye to it on the roadside. In today's "regulating people's food and smoothing transportation," the authorities should actively crack down on it.

### Mid-Journey Extortion

At the beginning of the opening of rice transportation, government bureaus repeatedly ordered strict investigation and prohibition in order to prevent military police along the way from creating difficulties and extortion, as well as local governments restricting circulation under the pretext of maintaining food within their borders. In reality, the checkpoints on the main roads in the suburbs have improved a lot compared to the past, but there are still a few military police who still demand small amounts, about 500 yuan per shi. Most vendors think that the amount is very small and have not reported it to their respective agencies. However, this trend cannot be allowed to grow. If it persists for a long time, it will inevitably expand, so it should be secretly investigated and cracked down on.

On the journey from Jinshan back to Songjiang, a rice vendor told this reporter: "At a certain checkpoint not far from Caijing Town, when a rice truck passed this checkpoint, the checkpoint staff asked for 50,000 per car. After many compromises, the result was that each car passed with more than 10,000 yuan." Moreover, outside the east gate of Songjiang, not far from the railway, a checkpoint would check the number of loads under the pretext of inspection when a rice truck passed by, and collect money from the escort. For example, if each load was more than ten shi, it would cost 60,000 to 70,000 yuan to pass.

In Zhoupu, special personnel are assigned to collect "security police subsidy fees" at the main fields for entering and exiting. All rice and grain and commodities entering and exiting or passing through must be collected. Commodities are charged at 10 per mille, rice and grain are exempt from collection when entering, and 5 per mille is charged when exiting. For example, if the local rice price is 600,000 yuan, 3,000 yuan is charged per shi, plus a handling fee of 600 yuan, totaling 3,600 yuan. However, under the order of the National Government authorities, whether exiting or entering, it should be exempted to facilitate circulation.

On the eve of preparing to return, this reporter met a rice vendor on the street and talked about the transportation situation. According to his description: "On July 8th, I bought a third-class ticket from Shanghai Xinlonghua Station to Jiashan. When entering the station, the police demanded 1,000 yuan. Then, after queuing, I spent 3,000 yuan to ask a black hat to write the number on my clothes with white powder. The ticket price was 3,000 yuan, totaling 7,000 yuan before I could get on the train. When I arrived in Jiashan, I bought rice in Shangzhen, traded one shi for 470,000 yuan, and used a rickshaw to transport it to the military station. Expenses along the way were 3,000 yuan. When entering the station, one shi of rice had to spend another 4,000 yuan, otherwise the rice bags would be thrown away or people would be beaten. When the baggage clerk weighed it, each piece of rice was 13,000 yuan, and the black market ticket price was more than 14,000 yuan per ticket. Before the rice bags were loaded onto the train, all kinds of people could extort at any time, each time costing 10,000 to 5,000 yuan before they could be sent off, otherwise they would cut the rice bags with a short knife. The rice in the baggage car must be guarded, otherwise when arriving at the station, there would be thousands of holes in the bag, and there would be little left in the bag. In short, one shi of rice costs more than 100,000 yuan to reach Shanghai, excluding food. And what is earned is only 20,000 to 30,000 yuan. Moreover, the suffering of the journey is all that outsiders cannot know in detail." After saying this, he was filled with grief and indignation, but for the sake of life, he still endured his tears and did it.

### Eradicating Hoarding

Since rice and grain have been purchased, some farmers only self-sufficient, and because the efficiency of wartime agricultural production has decreased, the reserves in various rice-producing areas are not abundant. It is not easy to collect a large number in a short period of time for export. At present, Shanghai's food supply is almost entirely supplied by countless porters.

As prices rise, most farmers are willing to store rice and gradually sell it out when there is an urgent need or when fertilizing agriculture. When rice prices fall, most households and industrial and commercial institutions, in view of past trends, purchase and store large quantities at low prices. A few rice merchants with strong funds go deep into the interior to purchase and hoard after free circulation. Moreover, some rice shops, because the local supply is too high, use the excuse of closing down, and on the one hand contact local powerful people to hoard and manipulate. As mentioned above, all of these cause rice and grain to be concentrated, losing the purpose of regulation. This can only be achieved by those involved understanding the importance of righteousness, and realizing and abandoning "ego" behavior, and should be thoroughly dedicated to the entire society, then the goal of abundant people's food and stable people's livelihood can be achieved.

### About 100 Enemy Planes: Blindly Bomb the City Again, Destroying Several Houses and Killing and Injuring More Than 100 People

The Shanghai Municipal Army and Navy Air Defense Command announced at 6:00 PM on the 22nd: "Between 11:00 AM and 12:30 PM on the 22nd, a combined enemy fighter and bomber force (B24 type, P51 type, and giant type fighter planes) of about 100 planes invaded the Shanghai area and carried out bombing and machine-gun strafing of airports around Shanghai and key facilities on the Huangpu River. Our war results: four enemy planes shot down, seven destroyed."

(Another report) Yesterday, a combined enemy fighter-bomber formation of about 100 planes attacked the Shanghai area again, first bombing the suburbs, and then bombing residential areas in eastern and southern Shanghai. However, most of the bombs fell on squares and barren land, causing little damage. Several houses were destroyed, and several fires broke out. Fortunately, the citizens had learned from the second bombing and took shelter early, and the number of casualties reached more than one hundred. The Shanghai Municipal Air Defense Headquarters, Fire Department, Rescue Department, and Work Department were fully mobilized, together with the police, security, and air defense personnel in each district, to vigorously fight the fire, transport the injured to nearby hospitals in each district for emergency treatment, and concentrate the dead for family members to claim. As for the displaced victims, relief agencies will find ways to accommodate and provide relief.

### News and Magazine Circles Hold Cultural Lecture Yesterday: Captain Matsumoto Attends and Lectures

The Shanghai Branch of the Chinese News Association and the Shanghai Magazine Joint Society jointly held a cultural lecture at 10:00 AM yesterday (the 22nd) to entertain cultural colleagues in the news and magazine circles. Captain Matsumoto of the Japanese Fleet Reporting Department in China was specially invited to give a lecture. Captain Matsumoto arrived on time with Wang Nanan and other staff members. More than a thousand people attended from the Shanghai Branch of the News Association, including Chairman Chen Binhe, Standing Director Chen Riping, and cultural figures from the news and magazine circles. The meeting began at 10:00 AM. First, Director-General of the Magazine Joint Society Wan Yi reported the order of programs, followed by Director-General Lu Feng of the Shanghai Branch of the News Association giving the opening speech, stating briefly: "During wartime, people generally believe that material resources are more important than everything else, and spiritual resources are secondary. But this is not the case. Cultural spirit is even more needed during wartime. We should actively promote culture and use spirit to overcome the cruel war." Then Captain Matsumoto was invited to give a lecture, which lasted for an hour before it ended. The entertainment program included Ms. Li Xianglan singing popular Chinese and Japanese songs, and screening cultural films.

### Financial Market Conditions: Sharp Rise Last Week

The market conditions of the financial, industrial, and commercial sectors in this city have continued to evolve in the past week due to the stimulation of various rumors. The intensity of the price increase is even greater than in the previous week, and due to the encouragement and agitation of speculators, people's minds are uncertain. Capitalists are constantly absorbing spot goods, resulting in depleted warehouses and transactions gradually becoming "no goods to deliver."

### Gold Certificates

The price of gold certificates started to rise on Monday. Compared with the closing price of the previous Saturday, the current and fourth-period certificates rose by 600,000 to 700,000 yuan per tael. After a flat Tuesday, they rose again. Although news of the issuance of fifth-period gold certificates was spread on Wednesday, it still failed to suppress the buying momentum, which was seen to be rising. At this time, the atmosphere was quite tense. The rise was even more intense on Thursday and Friday. On Saturday, it broke through the 9 million mark, and then retreated into the 9 million range. The price rose by more than 90% within a week. Silver treasury bonds and other currencies also followed suit.

### Chinese Stocks

The situation with Chinese stocks at two o'clock mirrored the surge in the gold market, even more so. However, it suffered a slight setback midway due to air raids. Popular stocks of companies like Mei-Ya, Wing On, and the textile mills sailed smoothly, rising steadily. Other small and medium-sized stocks all increased by more than 60%. The amount of cash in circulation is insufficient due to the continued rise in prices, but there is no panic, making it difficult to fundamentally resolve. It is not easy to tighten credit because financial institutions are still issuing promissory notes indiscriminately. The Central Bank authorities are closely monitoring this issue.

### Rice, Grain and Daily Necessities

As for the industrial and commercial sectors, the electricity needs of factories still cannot be fully resolved, and preparations for resumption of work are difficult to achieve as scheduled. Except for a slight slowdown in the rising prices of rice and miscellaneous grains, other daily necessities such as oil, sugar, soap, matches, candles, cotton fabrics, woolens, silks and satins, paper prices, and hardware seem to be rising continuously. In particular, the prices marked for goods sold in various industries have no standards, and they are changed and increased several times a day. Countless citizens are harmed when buying goods. It is hoped that the authorities will implement pricing policies and enforce them strictly.

### The City Buddhist Association Decides to Relieve Disaster Victims

Yesterday, the City Buddhist Association held an emergency joint meeting of directors and supervisors to discuss temporary shelter work for air raid victims. More than 20 people attended, including Zhengdao, Mijia, Baisheng, and Chao Cheng. First, Mijia, the resident managing director, reported on the inspection of the disaster area in Pudong. It was then decided to divide the city's member temples into several areas and issue an order to each temple to organize temporary shelter for air raid victims so that shelter work can be carried out immediately when an air raid occurs. The association also plans to form a Buddhist air raid rescue team in the near future to go to the disaster area and assist the authorities in rescue work.

### Yu Shijie, Chief of Staff of the Tax Police Corps, Takes Office Today

Since Neng Jiandong took over as the chief of the Central Tax Police Corps, Yu Shijie, the chief of the staff office of the Shanghai Special City Security Command, has been promoted to the chief of staff of the corps in order to improve internal soundness. Mr. Yu is scheduled to take office today.

### Road Loving Association to be Established Today

The Road Loving Work Promotion Association, initiated by the staff of the China Railway Road Loving and enthusiastic people, has been actively preparing for more than two months and is now ready. It is scheduled to hold its founding meeting at the Duchen Hotel at 3:00 pm today (23rd) and will entertain people from all walks of life. Zheng Hongnian, the president of China Railway, will also be present to preside over the meeting.

### "Home Doctor" Scholarship Movement Begins Accepting Applications Today

Hoping students from various schools come to the library to contact us

Our newspaper and the YMCA/YWCA have recently received a donation of 100,000 copies of "Home Doctor" from Bayer Pharmaceuticals. The "Home Doctor Scholarship Movement Office," jointly formed by our newspaper and the three organizations, will begin operations today and convene students sponsored by our newspaper and students from major middle schools to jointly solicit scholarships from all walks of life. Donors of 5,000 yuan will receive a copy of "Home Doctor." Half of the funds will directly subsidize students participating in the fundraising, and the rest will be donated to the work-study loan program organized by the YMCA/YWCA and the reader scholarship program of our newspaper, specifically for rescuing out-of-school students. The beauty and completeness of the contents of "Home Doctor" and its significance as a household necessity will be explained in another article. The student application guidelines are listed below, hoping that students from various schools will pay attention! All impoverished students above the middle school level in this city can apply to participate in the "Home Doctor" Scholarship Movement. Students who are interested in participating can pick up application forms at the following locations within one week from the 23rd to the 28th of this month: (A) Information Desk of the YMCA at Eight Immortals Bridge, (B) Information Desk of the YWCA at 638 Weihaiwei Road, (C) Information Desk of the Shenbao War Support Center at 309 Hankou Road. Qualified applicants and those with book receipts can pick up books with their certificates. Each university student is tentatively limited to 50 copies, and each middle school student is limited to 30 copies. Students who have already applied for the reader scholarship of our newspaper do not need to apply again and can pick up books with their student ID.

### Jusheng Bank Colleagues Help Students

A letter from all colleagues of Jusheng Bank states: "We recently read an article in your newspaper, 'Please Encourage the Silver and Money Industry to Initiate a Scholarship Movement,' which states that the silver industry is the mother of all industries, the convergence of all streams. Once initiated, all industries will respond like echoes from the mountains. It also requests that the heads of hundreds of banks in Shanghai unanimously participate in the scholarship movement, etc. Feeling inspired by this, our colleagues have collected 700,000 yuan in Central Reserve banknotes and decided to donate them to your newspaper's reader scholarship fund. The bank authorities sympathize with this and have allocated 300,000 yuan in Central Reserve banknotes to make up 1 million yuan. It is named the Jusheng Bank Colleagues Team. We are enclosing a check with this letter, hoping you will check and receive it."

The Jusheng Bank colleagues are the first to respond to the scholarship assistance and pledge to become an honorary team, which is deeply admired. Hundreds of banks in the silver and money industry will surely not lag behind in their enthusiasm for scholarship assistance. It is hoped that they will rise up together so that everyone can easily lift the burden and the scholarship fund can reach its goal as soon as possible.

### The Ninth Shenbao Reader Scholarship Special Fundraising Team

Honorary Team No. 10: Jusheng Bank Colleagues Team: 1 million yuan

Total including previous donations: 11 million yuan.

### China Central Railway Company Increases Ticket Prices by Two Times, Implemented on the 25th of this Month

In order to enhance wartime transportation capacity, enrich air defense facilities, and cope with rising prices and the expansion of operating expenses, the China Central Railway Company has decided to uniformly increase the railway, passenger, freight, and automobile transportation costs across the entire line from the 25th of this month. As a result, the railway passenger and freight transportation costs will be increased by 200% of the current ticket prices. This has been approved by the relevant parties and submitted to the Ministry of Construction for record. In order to simplify procedures, passenger transportation costs include the pass-through tax and are based on the third-class fare as the standard. The second-class fare is twice the third-class fare, and the first-class fare is three times the third-class fare. The revised passenger transportation costs from Shanghai to various main stations are as follows: (All are third-class fares) Suzhou: 7,000 yuan Wuxi: 10,500 yuan Changzhou: 13,500 yuan Zhenjiang: 20,000 yuan Nanjing: 25,500 yuan Suhu: 33,500 yuan Bengbu: 40,000 yuan Xuzhou: 53,500 yuan Hangzhou: 15,000 yuan Jiaxing: 6,500 yuan

(Express train fare) Third class: 4,500 yuan (Second class is three times more, and first class is three times more).

### Disaster Relief Enthusiasm is Raging, Mr. Sheng You Makes a Huge Donation Alone

Donations for air raid disaster relief are being enthusiastically contributed by all walks of life. Although yesterday was a Sunday and there were air raid alerts during the day, people still came to personally deliver donations in an endless stream. In particular, Mr. Sheng You donated 10 million yuan, and Mrs. Li Yun and her son Tie Jun jointly donated 10 million yuan. The latter also specified that 5 million yuan be used exclusively for burying the dead victims at the Pushan Villa. Their family's kindness is admirable. Mr. Sheng also provided two suggestions for disaster relief work: All those injured in air raids should be sent to the hospital. Regardless of minor or serious injuries, the hospital should accept and treat them first and should absolutely not ask the injured to pay for medical expenses first. Afterward, the health bureau should explain and ask the relief organizations organized by the Civil Welfare Association to pay for the expenses. All families who have lost their lives in air raids and unfortunately only have elderly, young, and disabled people left should be supported by society, but they must first register and apply with the Civil Welfare Association. The above suggestions are very insightful, and it is hoped that relevant organizations will adopt them.

### All Sectors Sympathize with the Air Raid Victims

Yikangtai Silk Store wrote: "Our city has suffered a devastating air raid, and the victims are displaced, wives and children are separated. Our colleagues cannot bear to sit idly by, so we have collected 3.02 million national currency. We hope you will accept it and forward it to the relief organizations."

Mr. Chi Zhenwei wrote: "Dear Sir, the continuous bombings have caused severe disasters. I am heartbroken by what I have witnessed. I am sending a check for 300,000 yuan, requesting that you distribute 200,000 yuan to the air raid relief fund, 50,000 yuan to the emergency medical fund, and 50,000 yuan to the Pushan Villa. I hope that all sectors and all citizens of Shanghai will fulfill their due obligations and donate generously so that everyone can contribute and jointly support this righteous cause."

### Selling Cosmetics for Disaster Relief

Mr. Zhou Mingde wrote: "Our city has been bombed daily, and the disaster area is vast, with many dead and injured. At a time when the cost of living is high, suffering such a disaster is truly unspeakable. Your newspaper and others have called for air raid relief. I am willing to send two imported cosmetics that I have in stock, namely one bottle of German-made 4711 Quining Hair Tonic and one bottle of American-made Dean Cream, to your office for auction, with a price of 300,000 yuan. The proceeds will be used for air raid relief. I understand that these goods have been out of stock in the market for a long time and will surely be happily purchased by enthusiastic ladies and gentlemen. I have been keeping them unused for a long time, and now I am turning the useless into useful, also expressing my sympathy."

### Launching a Mass Baoding Self-Defense Movement

— Yuan Shu

Yuan Shu, the president of Xinzhongguo Daily, gave a lecture at the Shanghai Radio Station at 7:00 pm yesterday (22nd) in the name of a member of the Municipal Baoding Propaganda Committee, entitled "Launching a Mass Baoding Self-Defense Movement." The secretary-general of the Shanghai Newspaper and Magazine Union, Wan Yi, broadcasted on behalf of him. The original text is recorded as follows:

### Strengthening the Baoding Movement

Today's discussion of the Baoding issue is no longer just theoretical talk, but a time to truly practice and strengthen the Baoding self-defense movement. "Mass Baoding Self-Defense," in short, is organized mass self-defense. During wartime, no matter what country, if there is no perfect Baoding organization, its land and people will suffer great damage once military action occurs. Therefore, during the war, there must be not only a strong front line, but also a strong rear. The so-called rear is a strong Baoding organization. Speaking of world wars, the Sino-Japanese Incident is just an internal strife in East Asia. After the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the significance of the Sino-Japanese Incident itself has been dissolved, and now it is a time for the white race to persecute the East and for the Eastern nations, especially the Chinese nation, to defend themselves and strive for independence and liberation. Located in the Chinese coastal area of Southeast Asia, there is a possibility of being subjected to landing operations or strategic bombing by the US military at any time. The result of the US military's landing operations will inevitably lead to a fierce war and cause the Chinese people to suffer an unprecedented disaster. We ask every Chinese, who is willing to sit idly by while the land and people of our country are ravaged? We do not have the power of self-defense.

### Promoting Four Important Tasks

The strategic bombing of major coastal cities in China by the enemy's US Air Force has recently begun, and carpet bombing is being carried out in the South China area. Recently, the Chinese people have also suffered great sacrifices from the air raids on the Shanghai area by US aircraft. In order to save the current crisis, launching the mass Baoding self-defense movement is what every Chinese citizen should do. When promoting the mass Baoding movement, we must accomplish the following four tasks:

Complete the wartime living system. In China, where the war situation is urgent, it is a question whether every citizen can implement the wartime system. Taking Shanghai as an example, we rarely see the mood of the masses to fight to the end. Therefore, we hope that through the activities of the entire Baoding, each Baoding unit can complete its wartime life. The Baoding training life style of the Japanese people is a good model.

Promote Baoding youth training. Youth training is the central work of mass self-defense. The best step to mobilize the country's educated youth is to start with Baoding youth training. Although some people have proposed arming the youth in the decisive battle stage, if this task is done jointly by the government and Baoding, it is a proper way to open up the future of Chinese youth.

Speed up the completion of defense facilities. Wartime Baoding is very important for various facilities such as air defense, fire prevention, and poison prevention. Plain cities have no natural air defense characteristics, so air defense facilities should be built as much as possible. In order to reduce the damage from air raids, we can only start with Baoding's air defense work.

Strictly organize the Baoding organization. Although the Baoding organization in cities and rural areas has been completed in terms of system, it has not yet been sound in practice. We cannot deny that there are still Communist Party or reactionary elements active in many areas. Therefore, the fundamental countermeasure for mass self-defense is to strictly organize the Baoding organization so that each Baoding unit becomes a conscript in the war, and the Baoding staff should be actively trained.

### Strengthening the Defense of the Mainland

From Germany's point of view, the Chinese coastal area is an important strategic area for the US military's operations. This area has the most abundant resources and the densest population. It can be called the vanguard fortress of the Chinese mainland. Due to the large population, coupled with a perfect Baoding organization, it is possible to strengthen the defense. The completion of various defense works recently can be said to be direct and indirect evidence of the mass Baoding assisting the war. Our Chinese people value their homeland and their clans, which is the basic spirit of loving the country and the nation. We earnestly hope that all compatriots across the country will launch a unified mass Baoding self-defense movement in the new century of world history, and do their best to assist the Allied brave soldiers and fight hard to defend the motherland and East Asia.

### A Summary of the Important Work Conducted by the Baojia Office Over the Past Year (July 1944 to June 1945)

— Gu Jiwu

The Baojia Office currently governs eighteen districts (including Pu, Xincheng, Lao Zha, Putuo, Jiangning, Jing'an, Taishan, Changshu, Caojiawan, Huashan, Changning, Xujiahui, Yi Miao, Penglai, Xieqiao, Zhabei, Xinshijie, and a portion of Dongchang District), totaling ninety Lianbao, 1,049 Bao, 16,067 Jia, and 471,083 households. The population consists of 1,077,702 males, 918,513 females, 264,233 male children, and 228,564 female children, totaling 2,489,012 people. The six districts north of Suzhou Creek, including North Sichuan Road, West Hongkou, Hongkou, Tilanqiao, Yulin Road, and Yangshupu, as well as a part of Dongchang District, are under the Baojia management of the Naval Garrison Area. The suburban areas are under the jurisdiction of the Shanghai Municipal Government Baojia Committee. Due to the differences between the Baojia organization and the jurisdiction of the police bureau in some districts, the issuance of residence permits has not been fully implemented. The municipal government is currently striving to unify and rectify this situation.

The Baojia Office is gradually compiling statistics on the citizens within its jurisdiction, including their place of origin, age, occupation, birth, death, religion, nationality, factories, and shops. Such statistics are unprecedented in China, and the initial stages of implementation have been somewhat difficult.

The Baojia expenses, approved by the municipal government, are derived from and used for local purposes, adhering to the principle of "expenditure based on income." From July to December 1944, a monthly fee of ten yuan was levied on dependent households, thirty yuan on regular households, fifty yuan on shop households, and a special fee (determined by the Chief of the General Lianbao and the Chief and Deputy Chiefs of the police sub-bureaus, based on actual estimates within the principle that the total amount levied should not exceed the total amount levied per Bao). The total amount collected for six months was 58,295,635 yuan. From January to June 1945, a monthly fee of fifty yuan was levied on dependent households, one hundred yuan on regular households, two hundred yuan on shop households, and a special fee (the collection method was the same as in 1944). The total amount collected for six months was 283,166,310 yuan. Eighty percent was retained locally for office administration and construction based on actual needs, while twenty percent was remitted to the Municipal Baojia Committee for city-wide facilities. The expenditure of these funds must be approved by the district sub-committees of the Municipal Committee. The Chief, the General Lianbao Chief, and the Chief and Deputy Chiefs of the police sub-bureaus are jointly responsible for the safekeeping and payment of expenses. The funds are deposited in designated banks, and withdrawals require the seals of at least three of the aforementioned four individuals. The Baojia Committee's twenty percent of the funds are budgeted and then distributed after approval by the Chairman.

The Baojia fees are collected monthly from citizens based on the amount approved by the municipal government, and a special Baojia certificate of the same value is issued, affixed to the certificate, and stamped by the Baojia Chief as proof. It also serves as a document for household registration changes and for collecting rations. This system has been strictly implemented, and no malpractices such as embezzlement or excessive charges have been discovered. Both the police sub-bureaus and the Baojia are able to know the movement of residents in and out of the jurisdiction, as the household registration within the jurisdiction is jointly managed by the police and the Baojia.

The Municipal Baojia Committee is chaired by Secretary-General Luo, with the Chief of each district committee and the General Lianbao Chief as ex-officio members, and the Chief of the relevant department of the Police Bureau as an ex-officio standing member, joined by local gentry and prominent figures.

All district sub-committees of the Municipal Baojia Committee have now been established, with a fixed number of twenty-one members. The Lianbao Chiefs, the Chief and Deputy Chiefs of the police sub-bureaus are ex-officio members, joined by local prominent figures and gentry, with the most respected among them serving as the Chief of the committee.

The most important work from July of last year to June of this year is described below:

Reissuance of Residence Permits — Citizen certificates or residence permits issued in the past by the old eighteen districts, the South Shanghai West District encroaching on roads, the old Nanshi District, and the old Zhabei District, etc., were inconsistent in style and content due to different jurisdictions. Following the current regulations of the Ministry of the Interior, they were unified and reissued, and thorough efforts were made to eliminate potential abuses. Reissuance procedures were established. Although some unscrupulous individuals violated the regulations and engaged in fraud during implementation, they were severely punished to achieve the goal of benefiting the people. However, the organization of the police bureau is based on the responsibility of the sub-bureau chiefs, and the respective sub-bureaus inevitably still have the drawbacks of adhering to established practices. Generally speaking, most of the past customs have been eliminated.

Establishment of the Headquarters of the Self-Defense Corps — Since the establishment of the self-defense system, theft, terrorism, and other crimes have been significantly reduced. However, each district acted independently, and due to the lack of unified methods, residents experienced different conditions even across a single street, which greatly diminished the effectiveness of self-defense. To remedy this shortcoming and strengthen its effectiveness, a headquarters was established to unify the steps. Bureau Chief Zhou concurrently serves as the Corps Commander, the Deputy Bureau Chief serves as the Deputy Corps Commander, and the Baojia Office Director serves as the Secretary-General. The Chief of the relevant department also assumed duties. Under the strong guidance of the headquarters, self-defense brigades were uniformly established in each district, with the General Lianbao Chief concurrently serving as the Brigade Commander and the sub-bureau chiefs serving as supervisors, to achieve close cooperation between the police and the Baojia. Knowledgeable young people from each district were rigorously trained to form model teams as self-defense cadres.

Assisting in Air Defense and Garrison Work — With the current situation becoming increasingly tense, air defense and garrison work are of paramount importance. The equipment of air defense and garrison materials urgently needs to be strengthened, which cannot be done by the government alone. The Shanghai Municipal Citizen Air Defense Headquarters specially established an air defense training center. Each Baojia district within the jurisdiction sends trainees on a regular basis to receive training. As of the end of June of this year, five classes have graduated, totaling approximately seven hundred people, who are now serving as air defense instructors in various districts. Currently, the fundraising for air defense and garrison equipment is being actively carried out with the approval and instructions of the municipal government. The total amount of donations raised is over 200,100,000 yuan, which is distributed by each district according to the approved budget to purchase air defense and garrison equipment, resulting in a significant improvement.

Establishment of a Propaganda Committee — To enable citizens to understand their obligations to the country and the significance of Baojia work, and to facilitate the promotion of organization and training, important personnel from various news agencies, newspapers, and the Municipal Propaganda Office were invited to serve as Baojia propaganda commissioners, bearing the work by district. Chen Binhe, the president of Shen Bao, serves as the chairman, responsible for planning, to promote a deeper understanding among citizens and to foster a fusion of opinions between the government and the people. The Self-Defense Weekly is also published to convey the activities of various Baojia districts and the laws and instructions of the government.

Holding the Spring Military Review of the Self-Defense Corps — To promote the spirit of self-defense and self-preservation, to enhance their interest in service, to expand their awareness of the country and society, and to review past achievements, a spring military review was held on April 15, 1945, at the Racecourse. More than 6,500 members from various districts participated. The review was highly praised by all parties.

Holding Training Classes for Baojia Secretaries and Above by District — In view of the fact that the full-time Baojia staff at and above the level of Baojia secretary in the past were responsible for a great deal of work, but lacked a deep understanding of laws and regulations, and that inappropriate behavior was sometimes discovered, strict screening and unified training were carried out. The districts that have already held this training include Penglai, Xieqiao, Yi Miao, Huashan, and Changning. After returning to work in their respective districts after training, there has been significant progress. All districts will implement training separately in the future.

Preparing to Hold a Centralized Training Camp for Baojia Self-Defense Cadre Personnel — To strengthen the self-defense organization and unify training, it is stipulated that personnel above the level of squad leader of the self-defense brigade in each district must receive centralized training. Preparations have been completed, and school will begin on July 1.

Unifying the Armbands and Identification Cards of Baojia Personnel — In the past, the armbands and identification cards of Baojia personnel in various districts were of various colors, leading to many malpractices. This office has now printed unified armbands and identification cards for distribution and use.

Taking Over the Issuance of Travel Documents for Foreigners — The issuance of residence permits and naturalization matters for foreigners in this city were originally handled by this office, while travel documents for foreigners were handled by the Special Commissioner's Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs stationed in Shanghai. In May of this year, it was ordered to be taken over by the Police Bureau, and the transfer has been completed, and the processing has been resumed.

Matters Concerning the Reduction and Exemption of Military Service for the Self-Defense Corps — The Ministry of the Interior and other parties advocate strict implementation of military service for the Self-Defense Corps. After the establishment of regulations, they were approved and promulgated by the municipal government for strict enforcement, so as to cultivate the concept that it is honorable and natural for citizens to fulfill their obligations to the country and seek cooperation with the government. However, the success of this matter still depends on the cooperation of government agencies and institutions at all levels.

In fact, Baojia work involves numerous tasks. After two years of active promotion, although social trust has been increasing day by day, it is still far from the ideal state. However, for a seven-year-old disease, one must seek a three-year-old cure. I can only uphold the guidance of my superiors, with a sincere and pure heart, striving to use my intelligence and courageously move forward.

### My Opinion on the Municipal Government's Change of Office Hours

— Hanya (Crow)

The reason for changing office hours in the summer is to avoid the heat, so that the spirit of the staff is at ease, so as not to reduce work efficiency. The hottest time in summer is of course in the afternoon, when everyone feels tired and lazy. If you want to work, the effect of the work must be reduced a lot. Therefore, the financial industry changes to half-day work during the summer, and the municipal government, starting from the 16th of this month, the office hours in the morning are still the same, and the afternoon is changed from 3:30 to 6:00. This not only reduces the efficiency of the work, but also causes great losses to the staff in terms of spirit and time.

Nowadays, most of the staff either eat in the municipal government canteen, or bring their own meals, because it is too far from home, time is tight, and going back and forth at noon is too hot. If the time is changed, there will be three and a half hours of free time in the middle. But there is no public transport to go home for dinner. Walking back and forth twice when the sun is shining brightly will make you exhausted when you get to the office, and the efficiency of the work will naturally be weakened invisibly. If you still eat in the municipal government, then these three hours of time in the afternoon are all free. Either chatting and making noise, or dozing off and resting, wasting this long half day. After a few hours of dozing or chatting, it is a very difficult thing to regain your energy and return to work. But, if you don't chat and doze off, how can you use these three hours? What kind of pastime is beneficial to your body and mind? There is no way to do anything but waste time. If the entire municipal government has 10,000 people, and each person has three hours, then 30,000 hours will be wasted every day, which does not seem to be very consistent with the principle of thrift during the time of national crisis.

If the staff all go home for dinner, then they will get up at 6:00 in the morning, wash up, and walk or take a car to the office. The time will not be too much. In addition to walking for dinner at noon, there will be no more than an hour and a half of rest. If you work until 6:00 in the afternoon, you will not get home until 6:30 at the earliest, and you will have to hurry to take a bath, etc. By the time you go to bed, there will be no free time. Every staff member, from morning to night, besides working like a machine, has no chance to read newspapers and books and cultivate their body and mind. The staff will also feel more pain in their spirits than before.

Secondly, in the sound of electricity restriction and thrift, originally all washing, bathing, dinner and other things can be completed before dusk, and then you can grope in the dark. Civil servants who can only get home at nearly 7:00 in the evening, and then hurry to take a bath, etc., will inevitably have to complete it under the lights. In the dimly lit office, or in the corridor, the lighting time will be extended by at least half an hour before and after office hours. Both the public and private parties will suffer materially.

Regarding work, for example, for the investigation of commercial firms or tax payment work, most of the commercial firms are preparing to stop business before 5:00, so there is almost no way to work after 4:30.

Therefore, I suggest that the two and a half hours from 3:30 to 6:00 in the afternoon should be added to the morning as much as possible, such as starting an hour earlier and extending the lunch break by an hour and a half, from 8:00 in the morning to 1:30 in the afternoon, working for five and a half hours as well. Not only can the work be consistent, but also a lot of manpower and material resources can be saved, and the spirit of the staff can be at ease. I hope the authorities can study and adopt this and make revisions based on it.

### The Urgent Need to Repair the Shanghai-Minhang Highway

— Diming

The Shanghai-Minhang Highway is a section of the Shanghai-Hangzhou National Highway from Shanghai to Minhang. This road connects to the southern section of the national highway at the Minhang ferry across the Huangpu River, and reaches Hangzhou via Nanqiao, Jinshanwei, and Zhapu. At Beiqiao, there is a branch line to Songjiang, which is connected to the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway. Therefore, this section of the highway is actually one of the important land transportation arteries from Shanghai to the south.

This road was built in 1922. Before the war, it was managed by the Zhejiang Provincial Highway Bureau. Due to proper management, the road surface was flat and wide, and the roadbed was solid and stable, making it one of the excellent highways in the country. After the outbreak of the war, the Highway Bureau withdrew to the west, and this road entered a state of anarchy. It has been eight years since there was destruction but no repairs, and we can imagine the dilapidated condition of this road.

The author went to Minhang from Shanghai this time due to business, departing by a China Central Railway long-distance bus. Initially, the road surface was still good, but after leaving Caohejing, the road surface was badly damaged. Not only were there ups and downs, but also countless holes, about one meter in diameter and nearly half the depth of a small air raid shelter in Shanghai, connected and arranged in the middle of the road, so that the car was constantly bumping on it. This situation was particularly severe in the long section from Wujia Lane to Beiqiao. There were also several deep pools with water accumulated from the previous days of rain, making it difficult for the car to find its way. As a result, the car's speed was slow, and there were frequent breakdowns. The journey that could originally be completed in one hour now takes three or four hours to reach. Not only that, according to the author's observation, if this road encounters old or heavy vehicles, the danger of overturning may be unavoidable, which is a matter of great consideration and worry.

At present, the evacuation of the population is becoming more active. However, talking about evacuation must first ensure smooth transportation. The Shanghai-Minhang Highway connects to the counties of Fengxian, Jinshan, and Songjiang in southern Pudong via Minhang in the south. From these counties, you can transfer to Pinghu, Haiyan, Zhapu and other places. In the west, it connects to Songjiang via Beiqiao and can reach Fengjing, Jiashan, and Jiaxing, etc. Therefore, it is a very important link in the evacuation transportation line. Furthermore, from the perspective of material transportation, most of the daily necessities and industrial products of the above-mentioned places rely on Shanghai to be imported through this highway, and the local food and local products of various places are also transported to Shanghai through this highway. Therefore, this road is also the economic artery of Shanghai and its neighboring counties. Therefore, regardless of whether it is from the perspective of evacuating the population or transporting materials, this road should not be allowed to remain in its current state of disrepair, but should be repaired immediately to facilitate the evacuation of the population and the transportation of materials.

I recently heard that the Su-Hu Highway, which connects Jiangsu Province and Shanghai, has broken through various difficulties and started repairs as a result of discussions between the local authorities. This road is entirely within the jurisdiction of this city, so the difficulties should be less than those of the Su-Hu Highway, and the construction should also be more convenient. I hope that the road administration and evacuation authorities of this city will pay attention to it.
