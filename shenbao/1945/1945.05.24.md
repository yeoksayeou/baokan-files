Editorial

### The Japanese Naval Spirit (Part 1)

Forty years have passed in the blink of an eye since the Battle of Tsushima in the Sea of Japan, a battle that gave voice and pride to the billion people of Asia! May 27th, forty years ago, was not only the most glorious day for the Japanese Navy but also a shared memorial day for the Asian people. At this final stage of the decisive battle in the Greater East Asia War, the loyal and outstanding Japanese Navy once again stands on the front line of the Pacific, embodying the spirit of the "Naval Spirit" for the fate of the Japanese Empire and all the peoples of East Asia.

The glorious tradition of "ever-victorious and invincible" maintained by the Japanese Navy over the past forty years is, in fact, a manifestation of the so-called "Naval Spirit." This Naval Spirit cannot be described by words in ordinary dictionaries but is fully expressed in the facts of the patriotism of the nation and its soldiers.

The "Naval Spirit" was first manifested on the afternoon of May 27th, forty years ago. At that time, the Japanese sea was shrouded in mist, brewing a historical battle hymn. The northwest wind blew in gusts, and the enemy fleet suddenly appeared about seven nautical miles south-southwest of the Japanese flagship Mikasa. The yellow state suddenly looked like two long serpents in two rows, gradually closing in on the Japanese formation. At this critical moment, Commander-in-Chief Tōgō issued an order to the entire army to begin the battle. At 1:55 PM, the immortal battle instructions fluttered on the color flag halyard of the Japanese flagship:

The rise or fall of the Empire depends on this battle!

All personnel, double your efforts!

Under this order, the morale of the entire Japanese army was high, and the enthusiasm to devote themselves to the country and annihilate the enemy burned in the hearts of everyone. Under the agitation of this "Naval Spirit," they launched a fierce attack, and the most glorious victory in world history emerged.

Later, someone asked Marshal Tōgō how such a great victory was achieved. Marshal Tōgō replied with the words "Divine assistance and imperial power." However, although it is said to be divine will, it is also the result of human struggle.

Today, when we examine the reasons for the Japanese Navy's victory at that time, there are several points that cannot be ignored.

First, after the Sino-Japanese War, although the newly reborn Japanese Navy defeated the large and corrupt Qing Dynasty Navy, the international situation for Japan at that time was very treacherous, leading to the story of the Three-Power Intervention forcing the Qing to cede the Liaodong Peninsula. At that time, under this harsh sting, the entire country, from the court to the people, was ignited with the demand to strengthen the naval power to seek revenge. The so-called "Naval Spirit" began from this point. Concentrating efforts on the construction of the new navy laid the foundation for victory.

Second, of course, it was the brilliant command of the marshals and generals of the Great Japanese Navy, and this command power was the result of accumulating battle experience and studying the enemy. Marshal Tōgō himself emphasized that the Battle of the Yellow Sea in the early stages of the Russo-Japanese War provided many valuable experiences. After research, fierce training was conducted, and there were extremely significant improvements in strategy and tactics. At the same time, Marshal Tōgō, as president of the Naval War College after the Sino-Japanese War, personally reread the "Sea Warfare Theory" written by Russian General Makarov, adding detailed criticisms and his own opinions. Even on the day of the 527 Battle of Tsushima, there was still a translated book of this work on the chair in the flagship Mikasa's commander's room!

Third, it was the "Naval Spirit" of all soldiers fighting to the last moment for the country. From generals to soldiers, no one did not embrace the fighting spirit of never stopping until victory, and they never considered any concessions other than final victory. They regarded dying on the front line of battle as the greatest glory and sacrificing for the country as the greatest joy in life. The so-called spirit of "each member shattering their bones to complete their mission" was to go forward bravely and never look back. The people in the rear also worked together with the same spirit to cooperate with the battle.

The Japanese "Naval Spirit" wrote the most glorious page in history forty years ago, and today, as the enemy in the Pacific once again approaches the Japanese seas, let us watch what kind of results they will suffer under the Japanese "Naval Spirit." The American aircraft carrier "Franklin," destroyed sixteen nautical miles off the coast of Japan a few days ago, is just the prelude.

### Analysis of Enemy War Intentions – Japanese Fleet in China Press Office

— Captain Matsumoto

(I)

After bravely fighting for more than five years, Germany has finally failed and fallen into the tragic fate of unconditional surrender. Today, the European front has sounded the horn of cease-fire. As the Irish Prime Minister stated in his speech on the 20th of this month, "The war has not yet ended. Smaller countries are quietly watching the great powers resolve their internal conflicts. The war is now entering its second stage." But from a military perspective, the war can be said to have shifted to the Pacific.

The current Sino-Japanese war in the Pacific is a decisive battle between Japan and the United States and Britain. Its core is the Ryukyu campaign centered on the Nimitz Pacific Fleet, the Luzon, Mindanao, and Tarakan campaigns based on the McArthur's US Army, and the Pacific war zone led by Marshal Arnold. The US Army Air Force, especially the strategic bomber fleet under Major General Ramey, is conducting bombing raids on Japan and coastal blockade operations, as well as the Southeast Asian operations of Mountbatten's British-Indian Army and the British Indian Ocean Fleet. In addition, the mainland operations of the US 14th Air Force stationed in Chongqing and the modernized Chongqing army can also be included.

(II)

The Nimitz counterattack, also known as "Frog Leap Operation," also known as "Island Hopping Operation," and "Stepping Stone Operation," is based on a geometric progression, launching leaping offensives on Makin, Tarawa, Kwajalein, Roi-Namur, Saipan, Tinian, Guam, Peleliu, Iwo Jima, Okinawa, etc. Examining its essence, it contains speculative elements and caters to the American public's desire for a quick and decisive battle.

The MacArthur offensive, known as the "Base Advancement Operation," is advancing slowly in arithmetic progression towards the Solomon Islands, New Guinea, Biak, Morotai, Leyte, Mindanao, Luzon, Mindanao, the Sulu Islands, Tarakan, etc. Although slow, it is a pragmatic warfare method. Although it disregards American domestic public opinion, it can be said to be a path taken from a completely military perspective.

The US Army Air Force in the Pacific war zone includes the 20th Air Force (B-29 bomber fleet) based in the Mariana Islands, and the 5th and 13th Air Forces based in the Philippines. When the former started bombing Japan last October, the number of attacking aircraft was only thirty to forty, and the frequency was only once or twice a month. Since then, due to the transfer of air force personnel from the Chongqing air base, increased production (the production volume in January this year was 135, and the recent monthly production is 200), and the improvement of the base, it is urgently seeking to bomb Japan and block the Japanese coast. The latter, in addition to preparing the Clark Field base, mainly gathers B-24 bombers to engage in the blockade of the mainland coast and the interruption of navigation. Although the air force of both has suffered heavy losses from the fierce attacks of the Japanese army, it is still necessary to be strictly vigilant about their future strategies.

The Southeast Asian Army under Mountbatten was newly formed as part of the overall counterattack against Japan in the Pacific. In the 18th year of Showa (1943), it encountered the preemptive attack of the Japanese Burma Expeditionary Force, and the Indo-Burma border was immediately lost, causing a sensation in the world and being regarded as a joke. After the summer of the 19th year of Showa (1944), due to the improvement and expansion of the air force and the assistance of the American-style Chongqing army, it gradually turned from defense to offense, and from this year onwards, it actually implemented a southward offensive with the goal of Rangoon. The future trend is the same as the actions of the British Indian Ocean Fleet, and it is necessary to be strictly vigilant.

Finally, the modernization of the Chongqing army's equipment is noteworthy. Although its effectiveness is not as great as its external propaganda, due to the construction of the Stilwell Road and the activity of the air transport unit, it is expected that forty divisions can be prepared by next spring. Once the mainland operations become full-scale, they will exert considerable effectiveness.

(III)

The enemy is promoting the movement of European military power to the Pacific and is eager to realize it. However, due to the complex and subtle international political relations between Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union, as well as strategic reasons such as insufficient ships and lack of bases, there is a certain limit to the deployment of troops. If the quantity and timing are judged, the impact on the Pacific war situation will not be significant at present.

In terms of naval power alone, most of the British and American fleets had already participated in the Pacific operations before the end of the European war, and only a part of the British fleet remains. In terms of land forces, the United States has 700,000 front-line troops and approximately 3 million rear-echelon troops in Europe, bordering the Soviet Union's 4 million troops along the Elbe River. Due to insufficient ships, it is expected that approximately seven divisions of 120,000 troops can be transferred to the Pacific as front-line troops by October of this year. By April of next year, there may be thirty divisions, totaling 500,000 troops. Therefore, the mobilization of land forces cannot be as large as the enemy advertises for the time being.

Finally, air power can be mobilized relatively quickly. As stated by General Spaatz, commander of the US Air Forces in Europe, although the air force is limited by the lack of bases, it is necessary to mobilize approximately twice the current air force. In particular, considering the enemy's active preparation at the bases in the Philippines and the occupied islands, as well as the possibility of using bases in China, the enhancement of its air power cannot be underestimated.

(IV)

So, under what intentions will the enemy adopt what form of operations in the future?

First, the Nimitz strategy has gradually developed flaws on Okinawa. Due to the fierce attacks by the Japanese special attack corps and air force, most of the enemy's naval units have been annihilated. The Japanese garrison on the island is fighting bravely, and the enemy's 10th Landing Corps has lost more than half of its forces. The war situation is in a stalemate, and the attack is completely blocked. In order to break this deadlock, the enemy may launch a new "forceful enemy suppression" operation. According to the news from the front-line reporters: "The enemy mobile unit has a slight sign of moving north." This may be regarded as a prelude to the new operation. The enemy claims that "in order to break into the Japanese mainland, more bases are needed," and from observing the current status of the enemy's land and sea forces, the enemy's target of attack can be speculated as its so-called "stepping stone to the mainland," that is, small islands that can be used as air bases.

The goals of MacArthur and Weygand are of course in Southeast Asia, which can also be regarded as a "branch operation" for the US and Britain to prepare for a long-term war, accounting for a smaller proportion of the overall war situation.

As mentioned above, Nimitz's island-hopping tactics have come to a standstill and developed flaws. MacArthur's previously loudly proclaimed mainland landing operations are also difficult to realize immediately due to the limitations of troops and ships. Currently, the enemy's main operation can be said to be the strategic bombing war. New York Times columnist Hansuld has warned: "The US Army and Navy General Staff also know that Japan cannot be subdued by dangerous means, so a long-term war plan must be established. Even if it is a big gamble on victory or defeat today, it will fail." The words imply criticism of Nimitz's tactics in the bloody battles on Iwo Jima and the fierce fighting on Okinawa in the past. In addition, when Nimitz met with reporters after announcing Germany's surrender, he also stated: "We expect that air force support will come from Europe, but there are not enough airfields in that theater to accommodate this large number of aircraft, so we must make full efforts to accommodate it. (Omission) However, if necessary, we will establish a plan to invade Japan step by step." This proves that he regards the mainland operation as essential, and the prerequisite must be a forced air annihilation war, just as the commander of the Army Air Force, Arnold, stated on March 29: "The United States intends to use all aircraft to broadly destroy Japanese industry so that the East Asian war can end sooner." Also, General Twining, who previously served as the commander of the US Eighth Air Force in Europe and was recently transferred to an important position in the Pacific, stated on May 11: "Our basic strategy is to conduct air strikes to weaken the enemy's strength so that the land forces can occupy the area. We will obtain airfields and air personnel, and establish supply lines and communication bases, and then we can expand the scope of air strikes on Japan." We must be aware of the enemy's intentions in this regard.

In short, the enemy's future intentions are temporarily not mainland landing operations or Japanese mainland landing operations, but strategic bombing and counterattacks in Southeast Asia. This shows that the enemy has changed its plans from a short-term operation to a long-term war. However, because the San Francisco Conference hit a snag, disputes arose over the handling of colonies, and there was no consensus on the handling of Germany. International conflicts such as the struggle for power in Poland, Austria, and Yugoslavia, as well as food panics, urgent needs of the people, lack of manpower, and a strong atmosphere of peace. All these phenomena expose domestic contradictions, so the enemy's long-term war will inevitably have flaws. We should always be patient, resolutely deal with Britain and the United States to the end, and fight bravely and dare to fight to win the final victory.

### Wang Chang Answers Reporters' Questions

Beiping, 23rd, Central News Agency dispatch: Chairman Wang of the Political Committee met with Chinese and Japanese reporters yesterday. First, Chairman Wang talked about his impression of his inspection of Jinan this time, briefly stating that he believes that going to various places for inspection as usual can allow him to talk with people from various places and learn more about the actual situation of various places for reference. At the same time, many incidents can be resolved locally, so he may go to various places for inspection in the future. Then, various reporters asked questions, and Chairman Wang answered in detail, with the general meaning as follows: Question: What is the significance of the Japanese Greater East Asia Ministry convening a conference of ambassadors and ministers stationed in China? Answer: Japan's policy towards China still adheres to the established policy of supporting China in completing unification and independence, and establishing friendly Sino-Japanese relations with political equality and economic mutual benefit principles, and overcoming all obstacles. Originally, the principles of political equality and economic mutual benefit are the unchanging policy of the government and the unanimous hope of the people. Japan's policy is like this, and China's hope is also like this. Question: Regarding the public security issues in various places and the issues of the security team and the pacification army, are there any rectification measures? Answer: Of course, special attention should be paid to the public security issue. Originally, the situation in North China and various places is quite complicated, and the troops protecting the pacification areas should be rectified as soon as possible in the future. With good local public security, the work of all other development and increased production will inevitably have good results. Question: What are your valuable opinions on youth and popular political opinions? Answer: My attention to the issue of youth did not start from now, but it has always been the case in the past. It has been expressed in my letter to young people and in other conversations. I will not repeat it here. Secondly, the issue of popular political opinions, the ancients said, "Those who win the people will prosper, and those who lose the people will perish," and I said in my declaration that "There is politics only with the people, and there is no government without the people." This is the traditional Chinese political concept. Even in the era of autocracy and feudalism, attention was paid to the issue of popular opinion, let alone today.

### British Prime Minister Churchill Resigns Suddenly Yesterday

Lisbon, 23rd, Central News Agency dispatch: According to Reuters report: British Prime Minister Churchill announced his resignation on the 23rd. An official notice issued from 10 Downing Street, London, stated that Prime Minister Churchill resigned after visiting the King of England in the afternoon.

Lisbon, 23rd, Central News Agency dispatch: According to Reuters report: The King of England met with Churchill on the 23rd. It is generally hoped that after Churchill's visit to the King, the authorities will have an official notice regarding the King's acceptance of Churchill's request to dissolve the parliament, and the notice will be issued within three weeks.

Stockholm, 23rd, Central News Agency dispatch: According to Reuters political reporter's talk yesterday: If the three-headed conference cannot be convened before the British general election, Prime Minister Churchill may not be able to meet with Truman and Stalin as the representative of the United Kingdom. However, if the Conservative Party can win one day, Churchill will still be able to lead Britain in the war. On the contrary, if the Labour Party wins, they will request the King to appoint Deputy Prime Minister Attlee to reorganize the cabinet. But if the Liberal Party wins, then the leader of the party, the current Minister of Aviation Sinclair, will be responsible for the fate of the entire United Kingdom.

### Veto Issue Causes Fierce Debate in San Francisco Conference, Another Difficulty

Lisbon, 22nd, Central News Agency dispatch: According to a dispatch from San Francisco: The veto issue that divides the San Francisco Conference into three times is increasingly pressing the greatest crisis on the 22nd. The small and medium-sized countries have launched all their forces and launched a final debate with the five major countries. The experts have made special efforts to explain in order to eliminate the conflict between the opinions of the thousand countries' international charter and the veto power of the major countries. The main points of the dispute are as follows: In addition to being generally recognized, do the five major international powers have the right to implement mediation activities and peaceful resolution measures by means of actual security assurance councils with military means with veto power? Most of the small countries oppose giving the five major countries a wide range of veto power. The key point of this dispute is that the Dumbarton Oaks Case and the Yalta Case did not determine the correct regions where the major countries used veto power. Gadagan, the deputy foreign minister agent of British Chief Representative Foreign Minister Eden, stated last week that the United Kingdom has the right to refuse to discuss and investigate disputes. Although the United States has agreed that the major countries have the right to refuse recommendations and actions, in order to make world opinion support peace and guarantee security, the freedom of discussion and the freedom of investigation are extremely important. Although the Soviet Union and the United States have not formally expressed opposition to this argument, Soviet newspapers have already expressed disagreement. Now the small countries want to know how the five countries' statements will resolve this problem. In the discussion of the international security assurance council, which is commonly used veto power, and which is not commonly used, the major countries quoted a section of the charter to explain in the proposal, but the issue of using veto power was not considered before the establishment of the joint statement of the five major countries.

### Labor Suggestions Opposed by Major Powers

Lisbon, 23rd, Central News Agency dispatch: According to a Reuters special reporter, the labor proposal requesting the world security assurance agency to be responsible for "promoting all work in the world" was opposed by major countries at the San Francisco Conference. Although the labor proposal was agreed by Modalaham, the leader of the Indian delegation and chairman of the "Economic and Social Association Committee" a few days ago, it aroused great disgust from the US delegation, and they struck at it, briefly saying: "This world security assurance agency is the government between countries. How can it do the work of a country and a family?"

### British and American Forces in Italy Take Military Action, Southern Army Withdraws from Occupied Area Without Resistance

Lisbon, 23rd, Central News Agency dispatch: According to a dispatch from Trieste, the British Eighth Army and the US Fifth Army on the Italian front began operations in Venice, a disputed area, on the 22nd, and sent troops to station on the Yugoslav border. According to United Press, the Yugoslav army did not resist when the British and American troops entered. The British and American occupations are very obvious. Just as Tito was about to resolve this dispute, the United States and Britain took military action. The future is quite worthy of attention.

Tokyo, 23rd, Central News Agency dispatch: According to a United Press message from Trieste, the Trieste area dispute is becoming increasingly serious. British and American troops stationed in northeastern Italy have entered the Yugoslav border line. The British Eighth Army, after being reinforced by the US Second Army, has begun to occupy the area from Trieste north to five miles east of Gorizia, and is also penetrating into the disputed Venice-Giulia area. The occupied cities include the Spino Mountains and Taranto. The actions taken by Britain and the United States have shown that they disregard General Tito's recent concessions and want to shatter the hope of peace.

### Local Communications

### Recent Situation of Anzhen, Wuxi, Vegetarian Delight

Wuxi is a hub of industry and commerce and is known as Little Shanghai, and Anzhen (a township in Wuxi) is also known as Little Wuxi. Anzhen is also known as "Jiao Mountain" (named after a clay mountain called Jiao Mountain in the west, located northeast of the county seat, adjacent to Dangkou Township). This township is called "An" because most of the residents in the area have the surname An.

### Transportation and Agriculture

Before the war, Anzhen had long-distance buses on the Xicheng Highway and a combination of wheelbarrows and rickshaws on land, and waterways (canals) had passenger ships towed by gasoline-powered wheels and sailing ships that carried both navigation letters and passengers, traveling to and from the city. It was also very convenient for passengers to take the train on the Beijing-Shanghai Railway. Transportation in Anzhen after the incident was very different. Whether it was long-distance buses or steamships, they were successively suspended due to the lack of gasoline and kerosene. Now, in terms of waterways, what has emerged in its place is charcoal-powered steamships and shuttle-like sailing ships. Anzhen is only a short distance of thirty miles from Xicheng, and the fare also costs several thousand yuan. There is only one postal agency in the post office. This is because navigation letters are more developed than postal letters.

Before the war, every household in Anzhen raised silkworms and planted mulberry trees. The situation has changed. Because the prices of crops such as rice and wheat have risen step by step, they have turned mulberry fields into rice fields. The prosperity of raising silkworms has become a thing of the past. There are also many others who raise pigs, ducks, cattle, sheep, chickens, and fish.

### Commerce and Education

The stores here are lined up next to each other. There are many cloth stores, foreign general merchandise stores, pharmacies, cigarette stores, and soy sauce workshops, and butcher shops, etc., and there are also many teahouses, restaurants, and dim sum shops, etc., because Anzhen people are the most fond of snacks. The famous and delicious snacks are meat noodles, buns, Tolo biscuits, and magnolia cakes. They sit in the tea dragon and taste and talk after work, or go to the restaurant to relieve their sorrows with wine, happily forgetting their worries. Anzhen Dai Shang calls out friends and gathers people, shoulder to shoulder.

There are many private schools in Anzhen. As for the school, there is only Anzhen Elementary School in the town, which is a complete elementary school. Most of the teachers are women, and their teaching is quite serious. There are currently more than 300 students.

### Public Security and Religion

In terms of public security, there were police sub-bureaus, outposts, and the Anzhen Chamber of Commerce before the war. Since the war, Anzhen has suffered from military disasters, residents have been displaced, and villains have been lurking. Although there are Japanese outposts and police to assist in suppressing them, the area around the Zhen area is still quiet. There are still many bandits in remote villages and alleys. Recently, there is a Tianxian Buddha Association, which has spread widely, claiming that sitting and working deeply can make knives and guns invulnerable, bewitching the ignorant people. One day, the Futang of the Association was destroyed by bandits, and the two sides formed gangs and faced off against each other, killing each other. In the middle of the way, they were killed by bandits, and the situation was very tragic. The Tianxian Buddha Association got the news and mobilized a large number of people to conquer and suppress, so the hometown was frequently alarmed by the crane, and they simply did not dare to step out of the door. The future of Anzhen's public security is really worrying. It is hoped that the police authorities responsible for local public security will quickly replenish the police's strength to protect the lives and property of residents in distress.

### Authorities Actively Planning Measures to Suppress Price Levels Changes to Merchant Evaluation Application Methods Are Coming

Recently, the price of goods in our city has been manipulated by speculative hoarding merchants, and the rising trend of major commodities has been the most severe, which has a significant impact on people's livelihood and public security. Minister Chen of the Ministry of Industry is quite concerned about the recent high prices in Shanghai and is planning to actively strengthen the resolute measures to suppress and stabilize prices. The Municipal Economic Bureau is also ordering its subordinates to conduct a thorough investigation of the high prices and urge the Price Review Committee to strengthen the fundamental and effective methods of reviewing prices. It is reported that the bureau will change the method of merchants applying for evaluation in order to achieve the effect of suppressing price levels.

### Strengthen the Implementation of the Guild System

In order to promote the completion of the wartime economic mission of the various industrial and commercial teams in the city, the Municipal Economic Bureau has actively investigated and completed the strengthening of the organizational structure of the various industry guilds in the city, and then classified them for review, and formulated the strengthening steps to be implemented step by step. It is now reported that the guilds that have been approved for elimination by the bureau recently include: the Old and New Goods Trading Industry Guild, the Clothing and Equipment Purchasing Industry Guild, and the Auction Consignment Industry Guild. The members of the above guilds are similar to the pawnshop business, and their illegal profits are even greater than those of the pawnshop industry, which has a significant impact on the livelihood of ordinary people, so it is necessary to ban them. It has now been ordered to disband immediately, but each member who retains the nature of repurchase should join the pawnshop industry guild, and those who belong to the abandoned repurchase nature should join the second-hand goods industry guild. Members of the auction consignment industry who do not belong to the members of the two industry guilds will be properly handled. As for the other guilds that should be reorganized and merged, they have been determined, and once they have been submitted to the municipal government for approval, they can be carried out separately.

### New Measures Implemented for German, Italian, and Hungarian Officials and Citizens; Municipal Government Has Informed Its Departments

There will be no changes to public or private property and all rights and interests. The previous measures of detention and control of Italian interests will not be changed.

These measures will be implemented for Germany from May 15th, and for Italy and Hungary from May 16th, and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has already notified the respective embassies. After receiving the telegram, the Municipal Government has informed all its departments to take note.

### Air Defense Authorities Regulate Lantern Use for Street Vendors

From dusk to 10 PM, it will be the preparatory lighting restriction, and from 10 PM to dawn the next morning, it will be the alert lighting restriction. Although citizens have complied since its implementation, there are still areas for improvement. The Citizen Air Defense Headquarters is drafting improvement measures, which will be announced in the coming days. Regarding the issue of open-air vendors, in order to preserve their livelihood, they will be allowed to operate until 10 PM every night, but the lamps they use must comply with the Headquarters' regulations, only using oil lamps with shielded reflectors to direct the light downward. The design has already been prepared and will be distributed to each branch in the coming days, where the Second Section will convene all vendors to observe them as a reference for setting up their own. As for electric lights and carbide lamps, they are not allowed to be used. All operations must cease after 10 PM, and those who violate will be punished.

Air Defense Training Continues to Recruit Trainees

The Citizen Air Defense Headquarters has established an Air Defense Training Institute to cultivate air defense instructors, selecting outstanding police and security personnel from various districts for periodic training. After graduation, they will be assigned to various districts to guide the public in air defense. The fourth class has already started. From this class onward, in addition to referrals from various districts, the institute will also openly recruit students. Aspiring young people are welcome to apply for training. After graduation, they can also be assigned to various districts as instructors. Many people have registered in recent days. There are still vacancies available. Young people who wish to receive this training can quickly register at the institute on Datong Road.

Open Call for Air Defense Scripts

The Citizen Air Defense Headquarters, in order to universally enlighten citizens about air defense knowledge and cooperate in air defense tasks, will be sponsored by the Headquarters and supported by the China News Association, the China Broadcasting Association, and the New Century Magazine, to openly solicit air defense scripts, divided into drama scripts and radio drama scripts. These scripts must deeply contain air defense significance. Experts will be hired to evaluate them, and excellent works will be given bonuses. The measures will be announced soon.

### Police Uniforms to be Standardized Starting Next Month

Since the merger of the former First, Second, and Third Bureaus of the Municipal Police Bureau, it now administers all police affairs in the city. However, the police uniforms worn by the police are different in the former Public Concession, French Concession, and Nanshi and Zhabei areas, and are also not in line with the central government's regulations on police uniforms. Since Mayor Zhou took over as Director, for planning purposes, it has been decided to adjust them and implement them starting next month. Regardless of the police uniforms in the former First and Second Districts, Nanshi, and suburban areas, they will be uniformly changed to the same style starting June 1st to achieve standardization.

### Education Bureau Prohibits Schools from Changing School Systems

Recently, it has been heard that universities and colleges in this city are planning to hold early examinations and divide one academic year into three semesters, which has led to some middle schools also planning to hold graduation examinations early. In order to avoid affecting the overall situation, the Municipal Education Bureau has instructed all middle schools to continue to follow the promulgated school regulations and not to arbitrarily change them. It is also reported that the Ministry of Education has approved this. It is now learned that after receiving the telegram, the Ministry of Education has issued an order to all universities and colleges in Shanghai, prohibiting them from starting vacations early or changing the school system.

### Taxation Methods for Real Estate Transactions

The Municipal Government, according to a report from the Finance Bureau, stated that real estate transactions are taxed at 15 per mille of the business turnover, as stipulated in clear terms. Recently, the Real Estate Trade Association of this city reported that some in the industry act as agents for buying and selling, and the commissions earned are not much. If taxed according to the previous rate, it seems too heavy. The Bureau has proposed that if acting as an agent for buying and selling and earning commissions, the commission amount should be the standard for taxation. If they are engaged in the purchase and sale of real estate for profit, the taxation standard will still be based on business turnover. It is heard that the Municipal Government considers the proposed methods to be appropriate and has instructed the Finance Bureau to follow them.

### Remittances to Shaoxing and Other Places Restored

The silver industry in this city temporarily suspended remittance business due to a shortage of cash in many areas. It is now learned that various shops and banks in the industry are actively trying to restore remittances to areas where they were suspended to facilitate the business and industrial sector. This has been implemented from today. The areas where remittances have been restored include Shaoxing in eastern Zhejiang (remitted via Hangzhou), Taixian in northern Jiangsu, Shi Ying, Bengbu in Anhui Province, and Taihu. If remittances are actually needed, the amount can not be restricted.

### Jiangsu Province Actively Promotes Wartime Construction Work; Mr. Chen Binhe of the Advisory Committee Speaks

Mr. Chen Binhe of the Municipal Consulting Committee was dispatched to Jiangsu Province the other day to discuss agricultural loans with the Jiangsu provincial authorities. The reporter of the Central News Agency asked about the progress of the discussion, which has been recorded in yesterday's newspaper. Mr. Chen reported last night on the general situation of Jiangsu Province's construction, as informed by the Jiangsu Provincial Authorities, and a summary is recorded as follows:

Under the emphasis of Governor Ren and Director Sun Yingchang, the construction of Jiangsu Province is actively promoting the pre-scheduled plan. The task that Jiangsu Province is taking on for construction is not only undertaking construction projects, but also increasing production work, which is also within the scope of its duties. Governor Ren believes that construction is necessary not only in peacetime, but also in wartime. However, wartime construction should be based on not increasing the suffering of the people as much as possible. The construction work in Jiangsu Province should also focus on being practical and down-to-earth, doing one thing at a time. The construction work currently underway includes the following:

Building Roads

The construction of highway bridges has a construction plan for monitoring the 66 main roads, including the Su-Chang, Su-Jia, Su-Hu, Chang-Tai, Kun-Tai, and Xi-Chang routes. The Su-Hu highway will open a new route, running parallel to the railway line, which is one-third shorter than the original highway. It is suitable for work to begin on the day I went to Jiangsu yesterday, and the entire project will be completed in about two months.

The renovation of the provincial capital's municipal engineering had been planned early, and is now being gradually implemented, such as reorganizing road surfaces and oil ditches, rebuilding bridges, and repairing city walls and parks.

Promote Increased Production Work By Utilizing the Land Along the Sujia Railway to Plant Food Crops Which Is Currently Being Surveyed and Measured and Divided by Planting Areas.

Construct wartime projects, such as building air-raid shelters in the provincial capital and county towns, digging trenches in various county towns and villages, and building earth forts to facilitate self-defense.

Develop West Mountain

The provincial authorities plan to designate the West Dongting Mountain Autonomous Model Area as an autonomous model area after a visiting group from Shanghai's industrial and commercial sectors went to inspect the area on-site. The Office of Political Affairs and relevant departments are actively planning it, hoping that Shanghai's charitable organizations, schools, factories, etc. will evacuate there, or operate locally. It is especially hoped that Shanghai's business circles will organize investment groups to invest and develop there. The provincial government will hire senior individuals with high reputation and experience to preside over it.

General financial institutions have an attitude of deliberately delaying the distribution of funds to various agencies, but the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Finance not only does not delay the distribution of construction, education and various expenses, but also often urges them to be collected.

Finally, Governor Ren expressed his gratification regarding the issue of cooperation between China and Japan. The provincial authorities are extremely cooperative in handling all necessary military actions during wartime, but on the premise of reducing unnecessary suffering for the people. For example, the recent purchase of cotton, with the full cooperation of the provincial government, was very effective, and the people had no complaints. This is a clear proof that China is expressing sincerity in assisting, and Japan is expressing trust, so that the outcome is multiplied.

### Gold Securities Market to Open for Trading at the Beginning of Next Month; 50 Brokers Approved

The second phase of gold securities of the Central Reserve Bank, which was issued on the 21st of this month, expired yesterday (23rd). On the last day, merchants and civilians went to purchase them as enthusiastically as in the first phase. The Gold Securities Issuance Preparation Committee will convene the second inspection meeting as soon as the Central Reserve Bank delivers the certificate of issue quantity and the gold to be delivered, and the report will still be checked by the monthly committee members Fu Xiao and Zhuang Yunqing. It is learned that the qualifications of 50 gold securities market brokers have been submitted to the Ministry of Finance for review and approval, and trading will be opened at the beginning of next month. It is heard that the Ministry of Finance will send two supervisors to the venue at that time to monitor the trading.

### Anti-Epidemic Committee Decides to Strengthen Anti-Epidemic Work; More Police Officers Assigned to Force Injections

The City Anti-Epidemic Committee held its fourth business meeting on the afternoon of the 21st. Those who attended the meeting included General Shibata of the Allied Forces, Tian Dailiangxian, Director of the Jianghai Customs Quarantine Station, Technician Matsu of the Embassy Office, and Chen Zongxian, Director of the Central Epidemic Prevention Office, and more than 20 others. Director Yuan Junchang of the Health Bureau was unable to attend due to illness, and Committee Member Chen Yidao acted as chairman. First, the chairman reported on the recent work of the committee and the number of cholera vaccinations in the first phase of this year, saying that since it began on April 20, a total of 300,000 and 435 people have been vaccinated as of May 21. This number is less than the same period last year. The biggest reason is that too many people avoid vaccination. According to the report of Committee Member Chen, according to cholera epidemic statistics, this year is the year of cholera, and it is difficult to avoid the outbreak. Moreover, due to air defense, people are digging and using well water everywhere, so it is even more difficult to predict whether it will spread. For the sake of the city's safety and to enhance work efficiency, the committee has decided to write to the Allied military authorities and the police bureau to assist the health bureau in carrying out inspections such as vaccination certificates. The committee then discussed and decided on several important cases: One policeman will be requested from the city government for each vaccination team to assist in forced injection, so as to achieve the expected results. Expand epidemic prevention propaganda, so that the people can clearly understand the true meaning of epidemic prevention and reduce the rate of avoidance. The committee, in view of the possibility of cholera outbreak this year, intends to add some isolation hospitals in addition to the existing isolation hospitals, so as to facilitate the accommodation of patients as much as possible in the event of a cholera outbreak.

### Biscuit and Steamed Bread Industry Prohibits Unauthorized Price Increases

The price of pancakes and fried dough sticks of the Municipal Cake, Steamed Bread, and Fried Food Industry Association was assessed by the Municipal Price Review Council to be 50 yuan per serving. Now, non-members of the association are taking advantage of the pretext of rising costs to increase prices without authorization, and some members of the industry are blindly following suit. The association believes that the amount of flour allocated to its members is not enough, and they should not follow suit. The association has specially notified all members to abide by the original price and not to increase it without authorization, so as to avoid punishment. It is heard that after the notification and advice, several companies have expressed their acceptance and are still selling at the original price.

### Construction Bureau Prohibits Extortion

The Municipal Construction Bureau yesterday reiterated its instructions to the personnel of the vehicle registration offices, strictly prohibiting any extortion behavior in the registration of general vehicles, and requiring them to handle registration procedures quickly to benefit the public. Those who are found to have committed illegal acts will be severely punished.

### Starting with "Save the Children"

Children are the masters of tomorrow's society. The success or failure of the future society depends on today's children. Therefore, it is unquestionable that people in society attach importance to child-care and care about children's health. However, although society also attaches considerable importance to primary school teachers, who are called "child caregivers," they are always poor and burdened due to the heavy pressure of life.

Children are like newborn plants, and teachers are of course the farmers who are in charge of cultivation. Everyone hopes that newborn plants will grow strong and have a bountiful autumn harvest. Under this goal, in addition to paying attention to whether the climate and land are suitable, how to make the farmers who are cultivating healthy, happy, and diligent in cultivation will be a very important issue. However, considering the current lives of teachers, most of them are groaning in the abyss of hunger, cold, and disease.

Society entrusts primary school teachers with the sacred mission of "cultivating talents for a hundred years," and it must not stand by and watch the difficult situation of teachers. Similarly, a healthy child cannot be produced under the guidance of teachers who are suffering from hunger and hardship. This is undeniable.

Society values and cares about children, which we have no objection to, but we ask society to give the same attention and care to teachers. With excellent teachers, there can be perfect education; with perfect education, healthy children can be produced! (Bo)
