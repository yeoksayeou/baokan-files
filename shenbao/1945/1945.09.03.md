Central News Agency, Tokyo, 2nd -- The signing ceremony of the surrender agreement between the Japanese government and the Allied Powers was held at 9:00 a.m. on the 2nd on the U.S. Navy's new battleship "Missouri," anchored six miles off Yokohama. The signing venue was set up on the upper deck on the starboard side. From around 8:15 a.m., representatives from the Allied nations entered the venue one after another. At 8:40 a.m., Supreme Allied Commander General Douglas MacArthur and U.S. Representative Admiral Chester Nimitz entered the venue, and all preparations were completed. In the center of the venue, a rectangular table, eight feet long and two feet wide, was placed. Around the table, facing the front, stood the plenipotentiary representatives of China, Great Britain, the Soviet Union, Australia, Canada, France, the Netherlands, and New Zealand, in that order, on the left side. On the right side stood Supreme Allied Commander General MacArthur, the U.S. representative, and approximately sixty U.S. staff members, lined up. At 8:50 a.m., the Japanese plenipotentiary representatives arrived alongside the "Missouri" in a small boat. Subsequently, Foreign Minister Shigemitsu and Chief of the General Staff Umezu, the two Japanese plenipotentiary representatives, and nine staff members also arrived. At exactly 9:00 a.m., under the chairmanship of General MacArthur, the signing ceremony began. Two copies of the instrument of surrender, one and a half feet long and one foot wide, were placed in the center of the table. The Japanese government's plenipotentiary representatives then stepped into the venue. Foreign Minister Shigemitsu and the Naval plenipotentiary representative were at the front, standing in three rows, and after exchanging greetings with the representatives of each country, they followed General MacArthur's instructions. First, Foreign Minister Shigemitsu signed both documents, followed by Chief of the General Staff Umezu. After completion, the Allied side proceeded with signing.

With this, the signing ceremony of the surrender agreement came to an end.

Sketch of the Solemn Ceremony in Twenty-Two Minutes

United Press dispatch from the U.S. battleship Missouri in Tokyo Bay, 2nd -- Silent Japanese officials, during a solemn and simple ceremony lasting twenty-two minutes, unconditionally surrendered the Japanese Empire to the Allied nations. Under the silent guns of the warship, representatives of the Allied nations quickly signed the instrument of surrender, which had a black cover in Japanese and a gold and green cover in English. As the ceremony smoothly progressed, more than eight hundred Allied warplanes soared up and down in the sky, making a final display of the Allied air power. General MacArthur calmly and solemnly presided over the opening ceremony, giving a short speech. Japanese Representative Shigemitsu Mamoru used a wooden leg to move forward (his leg was injured in the January 28th Incident in Shanghai thirteen years ago). The enemy envoy took a fountain pen from his pocket, looked at one watch, then another watch, and took out his pen. As he was about to sign, he discovered there was no ink. Finally, he signed with a pen borrowed from the U.S. representative. General MacArthur frowned, while Shigemitsu remained expressionless. Then, Japanese Representative Umezu Yoshijiro adjusted his horn-rimmed glasses and stepped forward to quickly sign on behalf of the Japanese Imperial General Headquarters. General MacArthur also signed, still wearing the gold-braided peaked cap he wore when returning across the Pacific and landing on the beach. He signed on behalf of all the Allied nations. Representatives from China, Great Britain, the Soviet Union, Australia, Canada, France, the Netherlands, and New Zealand signed one after another. General MacArthur solemnly stepped to the loudspeaker and declared, "May peace return to the world, and may God keep it always." This ceremony has now concluded.

Japanese Territory Reduced to Four Main Islands as Stipulated

Around 10:00 a.m. today (Tokyo time), Japanese territory, under the provisions of the Potsdam Declaration, was reduced to the four main islands and any other small islands that the Allies may allow it to retain. The Japanese People's Government, the Emperor, and industry are now under the rule of General MacArthur, until Japan is allowed to join the world organization planned at the San Francisco Conference. Shigemitsu stood leaning on his cane, stunned. When the ceremony ended, he helped receive the instrument of surrender. The Japanese representatives pointed out a mistake in a line signed by Canadian Representative Cosgrave, which was quickly resolved under consultation between General MacArthur's Chief of Staff and the Japanese representatives. Those monitoring the ceremony were several personnel who had experienced Pearl Harbor, Manila, Singapore, and Hong Kong. Following MacArthur was U.S. Army General Wainwright of the Philippines, British General Percival, the last commander to defend Singapore, U.S. Second Fleet Commander Halsey, General Stilwell, who fought in Burma, and twenty other officials, all of whom participated in the ceremony. When General MacArthur stepped forward to sign, he asked General Wainwright and General Percival, who had been held captive by the Japanese for a long time, "Would you like to step forward and sign with me?" General MacArthur showed a slight hint of excitement. His hand trembled slightly as he held the first of the five pens he used. However, when he began writing the first character, he steadied himself and presented that pen to Wainwright. After using the second pen, he gave it to Percival. He then used the other three pens in turn, quickly completing the signing. These three pens will be given to prominent figures in the Allied nations. Shigemitsu and Umezu left the Missouri approximately half an hour after they boarded the ship. The two bowed goodbye to more than thirty foreign dignitaries, forty senior army officers, fifty naval officers, Allied journalists, photographers, crew members gathered on high places even level with the crow's nest, and 238 released prisoners of war.

Key Points of the Japanese Instrument of Surrender

Central News Agency, from the U.S. battleship "Missouri," United Press correspondent aboard, 2nd -- The Japanese instrument of surrender was signed at 10:00 a.m. on September 2nd. The key points are as follows: We are commanded by the Emperor of Japan and the Japanese Imperial General Headquarters to accept the terms enumerated in the Potsdam Declaration on behalf of the Japanese government and the Japanese Imperial General Headquarters. We hereby declare to all the Allied Powers the unconditional surrender of the Japanese armed forces at Japanese Imperial General Headquarters, and all armed forces under Japanese control wherever situated. We hereby command all Japanese forces, wherever situated, and the Japanese people to cease hostilities forthwith, to preserve and avoid damage to all ships, aircraft, and military and civilian property, and to obey all the requirements which may be imposed by the Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers or by agencies of the Japanese Government at his direction. We hereby command the Japanese Imperial General Headquarters to issue at once orders to the commanders of all Japanese forces and all forces under Japanese control wherever situated to surrender unconditionally themselves and all forces under their control. We hereby command all civil, military, and naval officials to obey and enforce all proclamations, orders, and directives deemed by the Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers to be proper to effectuate this surrender and issued by him or under his authority, and we direct all such officials to remain at their posts and to continue to perform their non-combatant duties unless specifically relieved by him or under his authority. We hereby undertake for the Emperor of Japan, the Japanese Government, and their successors to carry out the provisions of the Potsdam Declaration in good faith, and to issue whatever orders and take whatever action may be required by the Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers or by any other designated representative of the Allied Powers for the purpose of giving effect to that Declaration. We hereby command the Japanese Imperial Government and the Japanese Imperial General Headquarters at once to liberate all Allied prisoners of war and civilian internees now under Japanese control and to provide for their protection, care, maintenance and immediate transportation to places as directed. The authority of the Emperor and the Japanese Government to rule the state shall be subject to the Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers, who will take such steps as he deems proper to effectuate these terms of surrender.

### The U.S. President Broadcasts Yesterday, Announcing Victory, and Seeking Permanent Peace with All Allied Nations

Washington, 2nd -- U.S. President Truman, after Japan's formal surrender on the morning of the 2nd, gave a broadcast speech, announcing September 2nd as Victory Day. The gist of the speech is as follows: "From today, we will enter a new century, and we, the United Nations, will jointly enter a new and better world of international cooperation and peace. We were able to achieve this result thanks to the blessings of God. Now, the attempt to destroy world culture has been shattered, but we must never forget the lesson of "Pearl Harbor," and the Japanese military will not forget the "Missouri." The crimes of the Japanese military will forever remain in the minds of the people of the world. They originally intended to conquer all of mankind with their military force, but this attempt has been completely shattered, and their army and navy have now become weak and incompetent instruments. The formal surrender of Japan is not a victory we have achieved solely through weapons; this victory is the victory of freedom over tyranny. As we celebrate this victory, we pay the highest respect to the soldiers who died in the war and to our great leader, President Franklin D. Roosevelt, the defender of democracy. From today, we must cooperate closely with other Allied nations to maintain permanent world peace. We still have many difficulties ahead, but we hope to continue our tireless efforts with the courage and endurance of the past four years. Although the burdens and responsibilities that come with victory are heavy, we firmly believe that the United States will be able to unite with its allies to establish a world peace based on justice, equality, and tolerance.

### The Japanese Prime Minister's Proclamation Urges the People to Endure Suffering

Chongqing, 2nd -- According to Tokyo Radio on the 2nd: Today, Japanese Prime Minister Higashikuni issued a proclamation to the nation, urging the people to follow the Emperor's will, to comply with all orders issued by the government and the General Headquarters, and the various provisions contained in the Japanese instrument of surrender. It stated briefly that, on this day when the surrender document is formally signed, when we recall the past, all kinds of feelings converge, and the infinite grief is difficult to express fully. The thought that the armed forces of our long-standing imperial army are about to be disarmed is infinitely painful. Now that the Emperor's edict has been issued, we must obey the formal surrender. Our loyal people should face the fact of defeat and endure its unbearable pain in order to comply with the imperial will. My Japanese people must maintain calm and order, and comply as much as possible with the orders issued by the government and the General Headquarters. We should maintain the enduring spirit of bravery of our nation amidst all kinds of tolerance. My Japanese people should silently reflect on the reasons for the failure of this war, and deeply repent of the past. At the same time, my Japanese people should diligently fulfill all their duties, in order to demonstrate the credibility of the Japanese people to the world. Although there are infinite difficulties weighing on us Japanese, we should approach this situation with unwavering determination. Under the principles of peace and civilization, we should do our best to seek the rebirth of Japan. For the prosperity of our country and efforts for world peace and culture, it is our duty and our responsibility to uphold the Emperor's will.

### The Japanese Emperor Issues an Edict Ordering the Earnest Fulfillment of the Surrender Terms

Tokyo, 2nd -- On the day Japan formally signed the instrument of surrender to the Allied nations, the Emperor issued an edict on the matter, recorded as follows: I have already accepted the articles contained in the declaration issued at Potsdam on July 26th of the Showa 20th year by the heads of government of the United States, China, and Great Britain, and later joined by the Soviet Union. The Imperial Government and the General Headquarters have signed the surrender document presented by the Supreme Commander of the Allied Powers on my behalf, and based on the instructions of the Supreme Commander of the Allied Powers, a general order to the army and navy has been promulgated. I order my subjects to quickly cease hostile acts, abandon their weapons, and earnestly fulfill all the terms of the surrender document and the general order promulgated by the General Headquarters. Issued on the 2nd day of September in the 20th year of Showa. (Signed by the Prime Minister and Ministers of State) (Note: This cable was the first Chinese cable transmitted by the Domei News Agency on behalf of the Central News Agency.)

Chongqing, 2nd -- According to the U.S. Information Service, San Francisco, 2nd, the Domei News Agency announced today: After the surrender terms are formally signed, Japan will formally comply with the Potsdam Declaration, and its legal binding force is equal to the Japanese Constitution.

### The Japanese General Headquarters Issues an Order for the Surrender of Japanese Forces in All Areas

Central News Agency, Tokyo, Reuters, 1st -- The Japanese Imperial General Headquarters, in accordance with the instructions of General MacArthur, issued an order to all Japanese military commanders at home and abroad, ordering all armed forces to immediately cease fighting, lay down their arms, remain in place, and surrender unconditionally to the Allied commanders.

### Based on Trust and Understanding, Maintaining Human Dignity, the Surrender Terms Must Be Faithfully Fulfilled - General MacArthur's Speech

United Press dispatch from the U.S. battleship "Missouri," 2nd -- General MacArthur said in his speech during the signing ceremony of the Japanese surrender: "We are gathered here to conclude a solemn agreement to restore peace. Differences in ideals and opinions have been thoroughly resolved on the battlefields of the world, so there is no need for discussion or debate at present. We are here representing the majority of the world's nations, not to meet in a spirit of mutual suspicion, malice, and hatred. All of us, victors and vanquished, should jointly display the utmost dignity, and only this dignity can benefit the sacred goal we are about to aim for. All of us should strive to safeguard the work we are about to formally undertake. I deeply hope that people all over the world will share this hope that, from this solemn moment onward, a better world will emerge from the bloodshed and slaughter of the past, based on trust and understanding, striving to maintain human dignity, and realizing the hopes for freedom, tolerance, and justice that we all cherish. The terms of surrender of the armed forces of the Japanese Empire are contained in the instrument of surrender before you. In my capacity as Supreme Commander, I hereby declare the traditional spirit of the nations I represent. My steadfast purpose is to continue to carry out my responsibilities with justice and tolerance, and to take all necessary measures to ensure that the surrender terms are fully, quickly, and faithfully fulfilled. I now invite the representatives of the Emperor of Japan, the Japanese government, and the Japanese Imperial General Headquarters to sign in the designated places on the instrument of surrender. As Supreme Commander, I will now sign on behalf of all the nations at war with Japan." General MacArthur then invited the other representatives of the United States to sign. The order of signing for the representatives of other countries is as follows: China, United Kingdom, Soviet Union, Australia, Canada, France, Netherlands, New Zealand. After the representatives of each country signed in turn, General MacArthur said: "We should pray that peace will now be restored throughout the world, and may God bless it forever."

### The National Government Will Reward the Soldiers of the War of Resistance Based on Merit; The Military Council and the Executive Yuan Will Formulate Detailed Measures

Chongqing, 3rd, 1:00 a.m. -- The National Government issued an order on September 3rd: "Resisting the enemy and teaching a lesson, eight years have passed, and the final victory was not achieved by chance. Recalling from the beginning, all our soldiers, hearing the call of righteousness, rushed to the rescue day and night, using their flesh and blood to face the enemy's advanced weapons. Even when the battlefield was reduced to ashes, the morale of the army remained as strong as metal and stone, advancing one after another, knowing only death and no surrender, knowing only the enemy and not oneself, regarding the eight years as one day. This kind of unwavering and loyal spirit not only terrified the stubborn enemy, but also served as a basis for the Allied nations to respond in unison. Their great achievements will be immortal. Now that the war has ended, and the sun and moon shine brightly again, washing away humiliation and restoring our homeland, at this moment of joy throughout the world and celebration throughout the country, recalling the long years of hard fighting on the battlefields, the Military Affairs Commission is ordered to convey to all officers and soldiers that they will be commended and generously rewarded. As for how to give awards separately according to merit, in order to encourage loyalty and inspire ambition, the Council should consult with the Executive Yuan to quickly draft and finalize the plan and submit it for approval and implementation."

Remembering Loyalty and Bravery, Promoting Righteousness and Valor

Chongqing, 3rd -- The National Government issued an order on the 3rd: "Since the July 7th Incident, we have launched a full-scale war of resistance with the determination to defend ourselves. Fighting to this day, eight years have passed in an instant. Deeply considering the soldiers at the front who have sacrificed themselves for the country, who have chosen righteousness and achieved benevolence, and who have given their lives in the face of danger, one after another, and the local people who share the same hatred of the enemy, whether protecting their homeland and suddenly encountering misfortune, or resisting the enemy's attacks and suffering tragic deaths. Those who did not compromise in the face of adversity and regarded death as a return were also everywhere. Now that the disaster of invasion has been quelled and peace has been restored, reflecting on the loyalty of jointly resisting the enemy, and promoting the praise of those who died for a righteous cause, all officers and soldiers who died in the war of resistance should be investigated by the commanders of each theater of operations, who shall order each army and division to determine their place of origin and their surviving relatives. By October 10th of this year, they are expected to submit details to the Military Affairs Commission for granting condolence money in accordance with regulations. All families of fallen soldiers, disabled officers and soldiers, and each [text missing] share the guarantee of life, specifying regulations for general implementation. As for the compatriots in various regions who died as a result of resisting the enemy, within six months from the date of recovery of the place, the governments of each province, city, and county shall investigate their names and deeds and report them to the Ministry of Interior for separate commendation and consolation, to demonstrate the government's care for loyalty and bravery and promote the ultimate meaning of righteousness and valor."

### Various Wartime Laws to Be Permitted for Application for Repeal

Chongqing, 3rd, 1:00 a.m. -- The National Government issued an order on September 3rd: "During the War of Resistance, the military took priority. In order to achieve victory and adapt to needs, the government had to promulgate various wartime laws. All aspects of people's lives, economic behavior, and even the freedoms of assembly, association, and speech were inevitably restricted. This was a common practice in all countries during wartime, and it was also an urgent matter for the government to reform in a timely manner. Now that the war has ended, everything should return to normal. All wartime laws promulgated during the War of Resistance should be immediately reviewed and reorganized by the relevant departments, ministries, councils, and bureaus. Those that do not comply with peacetime norms may first apply for repeal, in order to conform to the spirit of the Provisional Constitution and prepare for the implementation of constitutional government."

### Letter to the Nation from the Kuomintang: Hoping for Unity to Complete the Great Task of Nation Building

Chongqing, 2nd (Central News Agency) - The Chinese Kuomintang, for the victory of the War of Resistance, sends a letter to the people of the whole country, the full text of which is as follows:

Compatriots across the nation! At this moment of victory in the War of Resistance, with the whole country rejoicing, remember the famous saying of the Founding Father: "If a matter accords with the principles of Heaven, responds to human feelings, conforms to the trends of the world, and meets the needs of humanity, and is determined and acted upon by the insightful and the wise, there is absolutely no way it can fail. This is true of all revolutionary renewals, nation-building, and other undertakings throughout history."

The Founding Father's Teachings Resound and Are Answered

This saying, at this victorious moment, feels profoundly fitting. Discussing the future of nation-building, it is even more like a direct command. First and foremost, our party, following the teachings of the Founding Father, led the National Revolution and strived for success in China. Within this success, it has indeed realized the teaching that "even if Japan intends to implement its aggressive policy, the Chinese people will certainly rise up to resist it. Even if China is unfortunately occupied by Japan, no matter when or where, Japan will absolutely not be able to rule it beneficially," and has further realized the teaching that "before the Republic, our party adhered to its principles to establish the Republic; after the Republic, it adheres to its principles to defend the Republic." The Founding Father once pointed out that "our party truly gathers the fate of China's survival; if our party relaxes and does not exert itself, then China may almost cease to exist." Fifty years of revolutionary history and over eight years of War of Resistance records all demonstrate that the efforts and struggles of our party are inextricably linked to China's survival. However, the Founding Father also pointed out that the National Revolution is the affair of the people, and everyone should bear the responsibility of revolution. Our compatriots should remember the Founding Father's teachings from now on, constantly strengthen themselves, and guarantee the success of the great cause of nation-building.

The Three Principles and Five-Power Constitution are the Ultimate Standards for Nation-Building

Secondly, the Three Principles of the People and the Five-Power Constitution established by the Founding Father are the ultimate standards for nation-building and the grand framework for political systems. Now that unequal treaties have been abolished and Japanese imperialism has been overthrown, one goal of nationalism, "the Chinese nation seeking its own liberation," has been completely achieved. The second goal, "equality among all ethnic groups within the country," can also be achieved by following the teachings of the Founding Father and the resolutions of the Sixth National Congress to thoroughly realize communism. What remains to be rapidly promoted is the most progressive democratic politics and the most appropriate economic construction. These are the most urgent tasks for our party at present, and they are also the consistent determination of our party from beginning to end. We pledge to work with our compatriots with one heart and one mind, to redouble our efforts, so that the Principle of Democracy can be fully implemented in the shortest possible time, and the Principle of People's Livelihood can also be successfully achieved on schedule. Over the past fifty years, our party has fought alongside compatriots from across the nation, overthrowing the two-hundred-and-sixty-year rule of the Manchurian Qing, ending five thousand years of autocracy, eliminating the separatism of large and small warlords, abolishing one hundred years of unequal treaties, and defeating the Japanese imperialists who invaded the world. However, our party will never become complacent because of this. On the contrary, we should deepen our reflection on past mistakes with our compatriots and friendly nations, ensuring that lasting world peace is guaranteed. Within the greatest strength of the Principle of Democracy and the Principle of People's Livelihood, we should ensure that everything is owned by the people, governed by the people, and enjoyed by the people, internally to comfort our revolutionary martyrs and the soldiers and civilians who sacrificed in the War of Resistance, and externally to consolidate the foundation of mutual benefit, mutual assistance, coexistence, and co-prosperity for all mankind.

The President's Decisions Averted Danger and Saved the Nation

Furthermore, the prerequisite for the success of revolutionary renewals, nation-building, and other undertakings lies in the insightful and the wise, who discern the situation, weigh the rationale, and determine to proceed. The Founding Father led his compatriots in this way, jointly achieving the founding of the nation. Our party's leader will also guide his compatriots in this way, bringing about the opportunity to build the nation. Before the September 18th Incident, our party's leader shouldered heavy responsibilities and overcame great difficulties, which was already well known to our compatriots. When the September 18th Incident occurred, he solemnly decided on the national policy of resisting aggression and saving the nation, enduring the responsibilities of public opinion, firmly rejecting the enemy's temptations, embracing the determination for ultimate sacrifice, making the greatest efforts for peace, and making the most important preparations for the War of Resistance. When the July 7th Incident occurred, he recognized that the development of this incident was not only a matter of China's survival, but also a matter of the world's human fortune, and immediately called on the whole country to embrace the determination to sacrifice everything and vow to resist Japan to the end in order to win the final victory. Later, when the capital fell, he determined the national policy of advancing the War of Resistance and nation-building simultaneously, carried out a mobile and protracted strategy, and shattered Japan's attempts at a quick war and a quick peace, the clear effect of which was as great as shattering Japan's conspiracy to send troops to Jinan before the September 18th Incident to obstruct the Northern Expedition, and Japan's poisonous plan to oppose the League of Nations advisor after the September 18th Incident. When Germany launched the European War and the international situation changed unpredictably, causing nationwide anxiety and shock, he reiterated the consistent and unchanging position of resisting Japan, and determined that the final victory would still belong to the countries resisting aggression. When Japan invaded Hainan Island, he immediately pointed out that "this is the Pacific's September 18th," prompting friendly nations to be vigilant. When Japan launched the Pacific War, he ordered generals to dispatch troops and fight alongside the Allied nations, and advocated the establishment of a world security organization.

### Authorities Strive to Maintain Order, All Citizens Must Assist – Interview with Responsible Person from the Military Liaison Office

The Shanghai Temporary Military Liaison Office was officially established on September 1st and has begun operations. Yesterday, a reporter visited the person in charge of the office, inquiring about its establishment and mission. The information provided is as follows:

"This office was established in accordance with the orders of Chiang Bo-cheng, representative of the Chairman stationed in Shanghai, and Wu Shao[blank], the Shanghai military special envoy, to adapt to the current environment in Shanghai, to unify the liaison work of various units stationed in Shanghai, and to maintain public security. It consists of five sections, responsible for staff, adjutant, foreign affairs, liaison, supply, transportation, and military law. A representatives' meeting is held once every day at 11:00 AM, where representatives from various agencies exchange information and discuss important matters. Yesterday, it was decided that if any military agencies or units have illegal actions, the principle is to hand them over to the respective agency for handling. Other units of unknown origin will be handed over to the fifth section (military law) of this office for handling. In major cases, the military police and the Loyalty and Salvation Army Action Brigade will assist in handling. Regarding the issuance of gun licenses, all self-defense firearms of the current police bureau, without the approval of this office, will not be issued. The issuance of gun licenses will still be handled by the current police bureau, but it must be approved by this office. The styles of gun licenses that have been registered and permitted by the two public offices have been notified and sent to the office for reference when carrying out inspection duties. Regarding any units forcibly occupying civilian houses, arresting criminals, or extorting materials, the people can immediately report to the military police or this office, and they will be investigated and dealt with immediately, without any leniency.
