### Japanese Air Force Fiercely Attacks Okinawa Airfields and Ships: The Strength of Task Force 58 Weakened

Southern Ryukyu Islands Base, April 28th, Central News Agency dispatch: The Japanese Air Force attacked enemy airfields and surrounding enemy ships on Okinawa Island on the afternoon of the 27th, scoring hits on the enemy airfields, causing fires in several locations. They also hit several cruisers with torpedoes. Furthermore, they broke into enemy transport convoys, inflicting heavy damage.

Tokyo, April 28th, Central News Agency dispatch: The Japanese Air Special Attack Units in the Ryukyu waters, despite being hindered by the weather, continue to exert their powerful force to the fullest extent, hindering the enemy's invasion attempts. The enemy's mobile forces are now clearly weakened, particularly Task Force 58. This task force initially possessed more than ten battleships and over twenty aircraft carriers, making it a very powerful fleet. The enemy relied on this absolute superiority to rapidly seize Okinawa Island in order to quickly establish strong air bases on land. However, due to the fierce attacks by the entire Japanese Air Force, the enemy's plans have collapsed. According to the Imperial Headquarters' announcement as of the 17th, twelve enemy aircraft carriers have been sunk, two have been sunk or destroyed, and seven have been damaged, totaling twenty-one. In addition, nineteen battleships and many other combat ships have been sunk or damaged. As a result, the offensive power of Task Force 58 has lost more than half of its strength. In particular, only five aircraft carriers remain in the Ryukyu waters. Furthermore, the north-central airfields on Okinawa Island and the Kerama airfields have also had their usability significantly restricted due to Japanese attacks. Therefore, large-scale air attacks by the enemy's Task Force 58 are now completely impossible.

### The Emperor Visits Yasukuni Shrine

Tokyo, April 28th, Central News Agency dispatch: The Emperor visited Yasukuni Shrine on the 28th to personally worship the 41,318 newly enshrined deities, including Marshal-Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto, and the heroic spirits who defended the nation. At 8:40 AM this morning, officials from the Army and Navy Ministries, as well as Chief Priest Suzuki and others, were waiting respectfully at the sacred grounds of Kudan. Minister of the Army Anami, Minister of the Navy Yonai, and other related Army and Navy officials were also respectfully waiting in front of the Haiden hall. The Emperor, wearing an Army military uniform, accompanied by Chamberlain Fujita, Minister of the Imperial Household Matsudaira, Chief Military Aide-de-Camp Unenuma, and Chief of Imperial Visit Affairs Kato, arrived at Yasukuni Shrine by car at 9:30 AM. Led by the Army and Navy Ministers, he entered the main hall to offer his respects. After the worship, he returned amidst the respectful send-off of the officials.

### Tokyo Strengthens Air Defense Posture

### Air Raid on Surabaya, Taiwan

Taipei, April 27th, Central News Agency dispatch: From just past midnight to dawn on the 27th, approximately seven or eight enemy heavy bombers in several waves intruded into the Taipei area, dropped bombs near Tamsui, and then fled.

Jakarta, April 27th, Central News Agency dispatch: Three B-24 type enemy aircraft intruded into the Surabaya area at approximately 9:30 PM on the 24th. They were fiercely attacked by Japanese anti-aircraft fire, and two of them were seen to escape while on fire, and it is largely suspected that they have been shot down. The Japanese side suffered no damage.

### Difficulties Facing the American Enemy in the Future: Insufficient Shipping is a Fatal Wound

Recently, Commander of the U.S. Combined Fleet and Chief of Naval Operations Ernest King, during a meeting with a group of journalists, said with a hint of pride: "The United States, in less than four years, has constructed a tree of ships across 3,000 nautical miles in the Atlantic and 7,000 nautical miles in the Pacific (to the Philippines and Marianas). However, the most difficult task lies ahead." Ever since the U.S. Marines landed on Iwo Jima and the revitalized Task Force 58 under Marc Mitscher launched air raids on Japan, American public opinion has been clamoring for an invasion of Japan. Indeed, not long after, Nimitz and even Wedemeyer attended and declared, "For the purpose of discussing new Pacific operations in the future," a war conference of Army and Navy leaders was convened in their home country. During the conference, the strength of King's so-called "tree of ships" was obviously one of the focal points of discussion.

### U.S. Shipping Suffers Shortage

According to Emory Land's report, at the end of last year, the United States had a total of 5,633 ships, with a total tonnage of approximately 35 million tons. However, the actual number of oceangoing vessels capable of navigating the ocean, in various types, totaled approximately 3,610. In addition, approximately 900,000 tons of newly built ships of various types can be added each month. How is this massive amount of shipping being mobilized? Roughly 25.9 million tons are purely for combat use, 2.4 million tons are rented to the military and for other strategic uses, 1.5 million tons are used for foreign trade, and 2.5 million tons are used for coastal routes, totaling 32.3 million tons. This number must be distributed across the seven oceans, and its allocation is uneven. Especially in the new operations on the Pacific front, the distribution of shipping is even more unreasonable. Conversely, a shortage of ships restricts the scale of operations.

Now, let's examine the tonnage of U.S. ships mobilized for purely combat use. Of the aforementioned 25 million tons, approximately 7.12 million tons are used on the Western European front, including the British mainland, while approximately twice that amount, or 14.5 million tons, is mobilized in the entire Pacific region. In other words, half of all U.S. shipping is deployed in the Pacific. However, even the leaders of the Army and Navy are still lamenting the difficulty of obtaining sufficient shipping on the Pacific front.

According to U.S. Under Secretary of State Grew's speech at the Foreign Press Association, the amount of shipping used for the landing operations on Iwo Jima was greater than the tonnage used for the landing operations in northern France. In the Pacific, each soldier landing on an island requires sixteen tons of shipping for the first month and six tons per month thereafter. In order to supply the initial 100,000 troops landing on Luzon, the United States used 1.6 million tons of shipping in the first month. For the 40,000 Marines landing on Iwo Jima, 640,000 tons of shipping were needed in the first month, and even in the following month, 240,000 tons of shipping had to be mobilized to supply that Marine force.

The way a large convoy is operated can be affected by the operational situation, the geographical conditions of the operational area, and so on. Each battle has its own distinct features. However, it can almost be said to be common practice to first secure air and sea supremacy and complete the basic work of arranging the sea lanes. The U.S. Air Force had been active for more than six months in preparation for the landing operation on Iwo Jima.

### Steps in Landing Operations

As for the steps in a landing operation, they are roughly as follows: Once the assembly and deployment of the landing troops are completed, the first convoy, carrying the advance party, departs immediately under the cover of air force and naval gunfire. After the advance party reaches the shore, they immediately create a beachhead. Then, the main convoy, fully loaded with the main force, follows. After the main force has landed, the engineering corps lands with various types of machinery and equipment and quickly builds an airfield within the captured positions, staffed with the necessary personnel and equipment. Finally, there are supply convoys fully loaded with provisions and war materials. The U.S. military deploys a very large number of ships in this stage. Because a large number of ships are concentrated, the intervals between each convoy are very small, which is a noteworthy characteristic.

### Enemy Convoy Formations

During the Battle of Leyte Gulf, perhaps because of the long-range attack, the first convoy, which constituted the advance party, and the main convoy, consisted of many large transport ships. By the time of the Luzon operation, many of the convoys heading north through the Mindoro Sea and Sulu Sea were large landing craft, and even the second convoy—the group of ships carrying the engineering corps—used these landing craft. When the convoy reached the vicinity of the entrance to Lingayen Gulf, the vanguard troops to be landed switched to smaller boats and advanced rapidly towards the land. This was because the distance by water from the operational base to the destination was short, and landing craft could be used to transport troops directly. The composition and operation of convoys change slightly as described above.

### Enemy and U.S. Fears

What the U.S. convoys fear most is the Japanese special attack force, which sacrifices one plane to sink one ship. In order to counter this, they deploy a considerable number of special-purpose aircraft carriers in the convoy and, in order to reduce the losses suffered when a large ship sinks, distribute personnel and materials among smaller ships. The U.S. military adopted this approach in the Luzon operation.

Since last year, the United States has been working very hard in shipbuilding, rushing to build various special-purpose military vessels. In addition, in order to supply and repair the Pacific Fleet, it has established a supply convoy called the Tenth Fleet. According to their propaganda, this convoy carries "enough gasoline to allow 37,700 cars to drive for a year, and enough food to feed the citizens of a large city like Brisbane for a month." The United States is concentrating and mobilizing its ships in preparation for new battles in the Pacific War, in order to make a show of force, but Japan is also preparing everything and waiting for the opportunity to annihilate the enemy. If American warships approach Japan, they will surely be sunk to the bottom of the sea. These American warships that sink to the bottom of the sea will become excellent fishing grounds. This can be called "Roosevelt's Fishing Ground." (Translated from the April 2nd Asahi Shimbun)

### U.S. and Soviet Armies Meet at Torgau: Battle for Berlin Turns to Rubble and Fierce Street Fighting Continues

Stockholm, Sweden, April 28th, Central News Agency dispatch: According to information obtained here, the long-awaited meeting of the U.S. and Soviet armies was announced simultaneously in London, Washington, and Moscow last night. The two armies met on Wednesday afternoon in the Torgau area, 30 miles northeast of Leipzig. Initially, a U.S. lieutenant and three privates made a preliminary meeting with the Soviet army. The next day, the commanders of the U.S. and Soviet armies met. Stalin announced the fact of the meeting to the public last night, and Moscow celebrated with 324 cannons, each firing 24 rounds. On the same day, U.S. President Truman issued a statement saying that the anti-Axis forces under Eisenhower had met with the Soviet army at a predetermined location in central Germany, and the German army had been cut in two. However, this did not mean that the final victory in Europe had arrived, and the people of the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union still had to wait. Not only in Europe, but also in the Pacific, before the final victory, the home front must not relax for a moment. According to a London dispatch, Churchill and Stalin also issued statements simultaneously.

Stockholm, Sweden, April 28th, Central News Agency dispatch: Reuters reports: The battle for Berlin continues fiercely after 24 hours, with German women and children participating in the fighting to stop the advance of the Soviet army. The enemy's attempt to win a quick victory failed, and they continued to mobilize reserve forces and dispatched large numbers of dive bombers to strafe the German forces in the streets and Erbo [unclear]. The Soviet side said that it had occupied two-thirds of Berlin, including the industrial area. There was a report that the Soviet army had entered the Moabit district, a labor district in Berlin, after 24 hours. The Soviet army, which had rushed into the Berlin tunnel, advanced a mile yesterday and continued to attack fiercely. Most of the buildings in the war zone within Berlin had been destroyed and had become rubble fields.

Geneva, April 28th, Central News Agency dispatch: According to news from Paris, Paul Reynaud, Prime Minister of France at the time of the French surrender, as well as former Prime Minister Édouard Daladier and former French Army Commander-in-Chief Maurice Gamelin, who had been imprisoned by the Germans since the occupation of France, have now been released and have entered Swiss territory.

### Central News Agency Correction

In the record of the Supreme National Defense Council on the 26th and the order of the National Government regarding the adjustment of the personnel of administrative and military chiefs, the phrase "concurrently the Pacification Director of Kaifeng" was mistakenly issued under the item of special appointment of Bao Wen-yue as Governor of Henan Province. We hereby make a correction.

### Prospects for the Pacific War

— Keizo Matsushima

—— A speech delivered at a news reporting discussion group of the Shanghai branch of the New Association

The current Pacific War is mainly being fought in the Okinawa Island area, and fierce battles will unfold in this region in the future. Since April 1st, the U.S. forces that have landed have totaled six divisions, although the number of reinforcements has not been large. On the sea front, the U.S. forces advanced to the vicinity of Okinawa Island in five task forces from March 23rd, but their mobile task force has suffered devastating blows, with seventy or eighty percent of it being destroyed. The remnants have fled east and are reorganizing in the Marianas. At the same time, the U.S. Air Force has been indiscriminately bombing Kyushu and Shikoku, attempting to destroy Japanese air bases, but has suffered heavy blows several times, and its strength has been greatly reduced.

On land in the Okinawa Island area, there are currently two enemy and U.S. Marine brigades, mostly in the northern peninsula and on Ie Island. However, the operations in this northern peninsula can only be called "supporting operations," and the main front is actually in the south. However, the situation on Ie Island is strategically important and noteworthy, so the Japanese forces on that island are fighting very bravely. On the southern front, the enemy has been stopped six miles west of Naha for two weeks without making any progress. Since the 18th, the enemy has launched fierce counterattacks, the purpose of which is to suppress the four Japanese airfields in this area.

We can get a general idea of the details of the fighting around Naha from the statements of enemy generals. On April 20th, the enemy and U.S. authorities revealed that their production was not smooth and that supply difficulties had exceeded the limit. Nimitz also told reporters on the 24th after recently inspecting the Okinawa Island front: "The Japanese forces in that area still have extremely strong forces. The current military strength of the U.S. military is insufficient to cope with it, so we urgently hope that more European troops will be transferred. The defense fortifications on Okinawa are built by the Japanese military based on experience from previous battles, so they are extremely well-prepared. It is difficult to capture them even at the greatest price. At the same time, the Japanese military is good at using clever tactics, especially the Japanese Kamikaze special attack units, which pose the greatest threat to ships. It is impossible to defend against one or two attacking aircraft. In short, the tactics of the Japanese military in this area are the most sophisticated, especially the use of heavy artillery, the solidity of the fortifications, and the spirit of self-sacrifice, which are even more astonishing."

The enemy and U.S. forces launched an attack from the Maeda area with 3,000 troops on April 26th. Although they were repulsed head-on, they still have some residual strength. The enemy south of Naha also has intentions to attack. The enemy has been at a standstill from April 1st until recently, and the strength of their naval personnel has been declining day by day. Observations made on the sea surface on the evening of the 26th revealed that there were currently two aircraft carriers, transport ships, and battleships, each numbering more than ten. All of the special-purpose aircraft carriers between Okinawa Island and the Mariana Islands have also been severely damaged by the Japanese military. The battle on Okinawa Island this time is completely different from Saipan and Iwo Jima for many reasons: (1) The war zone is close to the Japanese mainland, and it is extremely convenient for the Japanese military to provide reinforcements and replenish military supplies. (2) The war zone is vast, and the geographical advantages can be used to strike at the enemy. (3) The desperate tactic of fierce collision is used to inflict devastating blows on the enemy. (4) The Japanese side can grasp opportunities, so now is the best opportunity to annihilate the enemy.

On the enemy and U.S. side, B-29 and P-51 aircraft have been indiscriminately bombing the Shikoku and Kyushu regions of Japan from bases in the Mariana and Iwo Jima Islands, but the Japanese military and civilians' belief in victory has not wavered in the slightest, and they continue to fight tirelessly. In this campaign, we place great hope and will soon be able to defeat the enemy. At the same time, although the enemy is concentrating its forces to invade, it has actually achieved nothing, especially in terms of logistics, where it faces the greatest difficulties, and even its most famous Tenth Fleet is powerless.

In addition, the enemy on the Philippine front has about a hundred B-24 type combat aircraft. On the mainland front, most of the enemy aircraft are located in Chongqing, Chengdu, Kunming, Changting, and other places, totaling about seven hundred. The scope of activity of the enemy air force is: those in the Mariana and Iwo Jima areas mostly target the Japanese mainland; those in the Philippines mostly target ships along the Chinese coast; and those on the mainland of China mostly target peaceful areas and the front line such as Laohekou. Indeed, long-distance aircraft departing from the above bases can all reach Shanghai. For example, the P-51 and B-24 types that have recently approached are those that took off from Luzon. Their purpose is not only to disrupt transportation but also to conduct reconnaissance from time to time. Also, the graveyard of B-29s has been moved to the Marianas, and the number of B-29s in China has been greatly reduced. However, in order to implement a nerve warfare strategy, large-scale bombing is still extremely possible in the future. Therefore, we must not neglect air defense work.

Before the San Francisco Conference was held, U.S. President Truman convened Secretary of State Stettinius, Secretary of War Stimson, Secretary of the Navy Forrestal, and the top leaders of the Army and Navy for a military generals' conference at the White House on the afternoon of the 23rd. There may be important changes in the Pacific War in the future, but the Japanese, led by General Suzuki, and 100 million people will surely stand up as one and fight to complete the final victory.

There have been small-scale battles in the North Pacific war zone. Although it has thawed after April 1st, the enemy's Ninth Fleet has not taken any action, which shows that its strength has been concentrated on Okinawa Island. The enemy and U.S. forces in the Philippines and the South Pacific have suffered significant losses, and their strength is weak.

In short, no matter how the enemy publicizes in the future, there are still several points that are beneficial to Japan:

1.  The main war zone in the future, both in terms of weather and geography, is favorable to Japan.
2.  The number of troops that the enemy can accommodate in the same area is limited, and there are often cases of mutual killing.
3.  The political relations between countries are complex and intertwined, with great restraints on each other.
4.  The Japanese side has high morale and firm beliefs, and is united in its hatred of the enemy. The more we fight, the stronger we become. (Notes by Qichang)

### San Francisco Conference Chairmanship Rotation

Lisbon, 28th – Central News Agency dispatch: According to an official announcement from San Francisco yesterday, an agreement has been reached regarding the chairmanship issue of the conference. Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov has agreed to the compromise suggestion proposed by British Foreign Secretary Eden. The foreign ministers of Britain, the United States, Chongqing, and the Soviet Union will rotate as chairmen of the conference.

Steering Committee Resolves Three Items

Tokyo, 28th – Central News Agency dispatch: After the steering committee of the San Francisco Conference convened yesterday morning, it discussed various resolutions, including: An executive committee to be formed by representatives from fourteen nations including Britain, the United States, the Soviet Union, and Chongqing. Rejecting the proposal by the Soviet representative to invite the Warsaw regime to attend the conference. Acknowledging the right of the Soviet Union, the Ukrainian Republic, and the Belarusian Republic to send representatives to the conference.

### Molotov's Speech

Lisbon, 27th – Central News Agency dispatch: According to a dispatch from San Francisco, Soviet representative Molotov delivered a speech to the plenary session on the afternoon of the 26th, stating in essence: The responsibility of this conference lies in laying the foundation for future security for all nations in the world. However, this issue has not been effectively resolved in the past. My opinion is that we should take this opportunity to review the irrationalities of the old League of Nations organization. However, we should not underestimate the various difficulties that our endeavor to build an international security guarantee mechanism will encounter. Indispensable to an international peace organization is the mutual unity of major powers who are consciously aware of their historical mission to safeguard peace and who must exert the strength of this organization, namely Britain, the United States, the Soviet Union, France, and Chongqing. The representatives of these five nations must cooperate absolutely, and other nations should assist these five major powers. The new international organization must have the strength to maintain general peace, and this organization should also have the military force necessary to maintain peace. If so, the Soviet people will certainly support the establishment of this sound international structure and will be extremely willing to contribute everything.

### Huazhong Hydroelectric Company Shanghai Electrical Branch

——An Analysis of Public Utilities in this City

Employee Benefits

Excluding foreign nationals, the entire plant employs approximately 700 workers. In January of the Republic Year 27, about 300 workers were laid off, accounting for about one-quarter of the total number (originally over 1,000 domestic employees). The layoff method was firstly, leave of absence with pay, and secondly, layoffs. There haven't been large-scale layoffs in the past two or three years. Regarding employee benefits, generally speaking, wages can be divided into monthly salaries (foremen), daily wages (team leaders and workers), and piecework (a portion of the workers in the technical workshops). Foremen are treated as staff members, and their meals, bathing facilities, etc., are all in the same location as the staff. Moreover, their salaries are about twice as high as those of ordinary workers. Other benefits, such as annual salary increases, consolation salary increases, pensions, bereavement payments, year-end bonuses, holidays, sick leave, etc., have special regulations. In addition, the benefits of Russian employees and foreign staff are also higher than those of domestic employees, and there are various guarantees in life and career. Since the power company was under military management, its employees can apply for electricity without restrictions, and the cost is lower. However, employees are qualified to be second landlords, and the area is limited to residents of the old first district.

Electricity Usage Limits

The first electricity restriction was implemented in January 1944. The standard was based on the highest monthly electricity consumption for lighting, heating, and power in August, September, and October of 1943, with a discount. Residential lighting was discounted by 40%, and heating was discounted by 60%. Commercial lighting was discounted by 30%, and heating was discounted by 60% (those used for cooking were discounted by 40%). Hair salons, restaurants, hotels, etc., were discounted by 45% for lighting. Factories were discounted by 15% or 20%, depending on the importance of the products. This was the first restriction on electricity usage for residents, businesses, and factories. Furthermore, the minimum usage for factories was 25 kilowatt-hours.

In September 1944, electricity for residential and commercial lighting and heating was halved again. Heating, except for cooking, was completely stopped for unclear usage. The minimum limit for lighting was 13 kilowatt-hours. Commercial lighting and factory electricity were discounted by 30%, and the minimum limit for lighting was 18 kilowatt-hours.

From October 1944, for residential and commercial users with limits above 40 kilowatt-hours, the limits were further discounted based on the amperage of the meter. 3 amps were uniformly changed to 25 kilowatt-hours, 5 amps were changed to 40 kilowatt-hours, and 10 amps were changed to 50 kilowatt-hours. Those below the limit remained the same.

From November 1944, the power supply for factories and shops was completely stopped, except for special cases such as artesian wells and water pumping, which were allowed with permission, and meters without limits were completely removed.

From March 1945, the limits on electricity for lighting and heating for residential, commercial, and factory users were halved again. The minimum limit for residential and commercial users was 7 kilowatt-hours, and for factories, it was 9 kilowatt-hours. The limit for power supply allowed for special circumstances was mostly calculated on a daily basis.

In the past, the price of electricity was 110 yuan per kilowatt-hour for lighting and heating and 80 yuan for power. The price of electricity for company employees was 33 yuan per kilowatt-hour for lighting and heating. Recently, due to the increase in fuel and other costs, the company applied to the authorities for a price increase and was approved on April 25th. The new prices are 250 yuan per kilowatt-hour for lighting and heating and 220 yuan per kilowatt-hour for power. The price of electricity for company employees is 75 yuan per kilowatt-hour for lighting and heating. The new prices are effective from April. The method for dealing with exceeding the limits is as follows: a penalty of twice the price for exceeding the limit by 10%, a penalty of five times the price for the second 10%, and a penalty of 19 times the price for the rest. For example, if the limit is 100 kilowatt-hours and the usage is 125 kilowatt-hours, the 25 kilowatt-hours exceeding the limit will be penalized as follows: 10 kilowatt-hours will be penalized at twice the price, 10 kilowatt-hours will be penalized at five times the price, and 5 kilowatt-hours will be penalized at 19 times the price. If the limit is exceeded by more than 20% twice, the electricity will be cut off for 10 days for the first offense and permanently for the second offense. The highest fines are paid by pharmaceutical factories, canning factories, and yarn factories, with one factory reaching tens of millions of yuan.

Coal for Electricity Exchange

Recently, the Shanghai Electrical Branch has established a method for exchanging coal for electricity. Any factory can apply through an introduction. The procedure is to first prepare an application letter stating the factory name, location, products, and electricity requirements, and bring the electricity bill and factory seal to the company's business department on the 5th floor of 181 Nanjing Road for negotiation. The principle is that each ton of coal can be exchanged for 350 kilowatt-hours of electricity. Initially, the minimum exchange was two tons, but now it has been changed to five tons. These 1,700 kilowatt-hours of electricity must be used up within two months. If that much electricity is not needed, several factories can apply together. After the form is reviewed, wait for notification. If approved, a coal voucher will be issued, and the enemy factory can send the purchased coal directly to the power plant to connect the line for electricity distribution. (End)

### Measures to Crack Down on the Gold Black Market Under Study

The sharp and rapid rise in gold prices in this city in the past two weeks has stimulated the prosperity of government bonds and stocks related to finance, creating a chaotic situation. Therefore, the Finance Bureau has specially appointed Zhang Guiru, Zhang Zhonghuan, and Li Ji from the Central Reserve Bank's Financial Inspection Office to jointly investigate the trading accounts of brokers at the Shanghai Chinese Business Securities Exchange and inspect the lending business of various financial institutions to see if there is any exploitation of depositors' funds to engage in gold speculation. The investigation and inspection work has been largely completed and will be reported to the Ministry of Finance for instructions. It is understood that measures to crack down on the gold black market are currently being studied and formulated by relevant economic authorities. There should be a standard limit for the rise and fall of market prices. Because the market conditions have fluctuated severely in the past, with prices rising and falling sharply, the difference is huge, and the risk of overturning assets is very high, which indirectly affects the stability of the entire finance and stimulates the rise of general commodities, and is also closely related to social people's livelihood and security.

### Jiang Shiyan Case to Open for Trial on the Fourth of Next Month

### Strengthening Control Work of the Materials Review Council: Adjustments to Organizations and Personnel of Various Control Associations

Zhou Fohai, Chairman of the Materials Control Review Committee, and Chen Junhui, Secretary, deemed the wartime control of materials for national use and civilian needs increasingly important. In addition to vigorously promoting the operation of various materials control businesses under the Trade Control Association, they are actively pushing forward with reforms, and have decided that the Shanghai office will be permitted to convene a liaison meeting of various control associations every two weeks, as convenient, in order to expedite and smooth out material reviews. Therefore, thorough adjustments to the organizations and personnel of various control associations are not only specifically aimed at strengthening the business and affairs of the control organs, but also are definitely deeply related to the fulfillment of the predetermined goals of material exchange between the provinces and cities of Central China. The movement of all materials has recently been very smooth, and the complex problems in transportation are also being considered for overcoming steps, and it is expected that they will be gradually resolved in the near future. It is heard that Chen Shilong's recent visit to Shanghai is highly related to material control and material production matters.

### Changeover Ceremony for New and Old Deputy Directors of the Police Bureau Held Yesterday

Deputy Director Du Delivered Instructions on Behalf of Concurrently Serving Director Zhou

Lu Ying, Deputy Director of the Shanghai Police Bureau, was ordered to be transferred to the National Government as a Senior Aide-de-Camp. The vacancy will be filled by Man Qiwei, Chief of the First Division of the Municipal Government, who will serve as acting Deputy Director and concurrently hold the position of Chief of the First Division. The changeover ceremony was held in the hall on the eighth floor of the bureau yesterday morning (the 28th). Concurrently Serving Director Zhou was in Nanjing on official business and specially appointed Deputy Director Bo Zhengjian to preside over the ceremony. The new and outgoing Deputy Directors Lu and Man, as well as the chiefs of all divisions and sections, and the chiefs of all branch bureaus, along with other high-ranking police officers, were present.

Instructions from Concurrently Serving Director Zhou

First, Deputy Director Du delivered instructions on behalf of Concurrently Serving Director Zhou, stating: "This time, Deputy Director Lu has been honored with an important position in the central government, and Acting Deputy Director Man has taken office. I feel deeply moved. Deputy Director Lu has a long history in the police force, originally serving as the director in the city center. After the return of the concessions, he served as the second director. After the merger, he began serving as the deputy director of this bureau. His contributions to the police force are truly great. Acting Deputy Director Man originally served as the chief of the Anhui Provincial Police Department and is currently the chief of the First Division of this bureau. During his tenure, he fully demonstrated his agile skills in refreshing police administration and improving benefits. This is well known to everyone. In the future, as acting Deputy Director, he will surely make even greater contributions. I hope everyone will provide more assistance to strengthen the police force."

Speech by Deputy Director Lu

Next, Deputy Director Lu delivered a speech, stating: "I am very grateful for the assistance I have received from everyone during my tenure. The purpose of my service in the bureau has always been to 'care for the people and reduce their suffering. Even if I do not have the power to reduce the people's difficulties, I must absolutely not cause the people to increase their suffering.' Acting Deputy Director Man and I are old colleagues, and his past achievements are commendable. I hope that everyone will help Acting Deputy Director Man to work hard on police affairs and ensure local security."

Speech by Deputy Director Man

Finally, Acting Deputy Director Man delivered an inaugural speech, stating: "Deputy Director Lu of this bureau has been honorably promoted to an important position as Senior Aide-de-Camp in the central government. The municipal government has appointed me to fill the vacancy, while also temporarily serving as the Chief of the First Division. Upon receiving this order, I deeply feel that my abilities are insufficient for this important responsibility. As I begin my tenure, I would like to report my intentions as follows: My work will center on strictly adhering to the police administration reform plan and various central government laws and regulations announced by Mayor and Director Zhou, with a fearless and selfless spirit, and a determination not to stop until the goal is achieved. I will work tirelessly, regardless of praise or criticism, and work together with my colleagues under the leadership of Concurrently Serving Director to complete the police administration reform plan. At the same time, I will do my best to ensure the peace and well-being of the citizens of Shanghai and enhance their welfare. Furthermore, I will work with my colleagues to pay attention to correcting police discipline, rectifying police service, and strengthening police education, in order to promote a model police force and fulfill the heavenly duty of being faithful public servants to the people. I hope that my colleagues will 'unite sincerely.' Shanghai is an important area for military, political, cultural, and economic affairs. Because it has a long historical environment and unique characteristics, all of my colleagues must, regardless of nationality or region, work with a spirit of Sino-Japanese co-existence and death, and make courageous and diligent efforts so that all measures of Shanghai's police administration can conform to the central system and achieve our work requirements."

Welcome to Deputy Director Man

Man Qiwei, the appointed acting Deputy Director of the Shanghai Police Bureau, officially took office yesterday.

### Stationery and Instrument Industry Association Generously Donates One Hundred Dozen Pencils to Charity School

In addition to a portion of the stationery used by students at the newspaper's charity school being printed and donated by this newspaper, there is still a shortage of pencils, medium-sized calligraphy brushes, and other items for middle and high grades. A letter was sent to the Stationery and Instrument Industry Association of this city to solicit donations in order to maximize the effect. We have received a reply letter and a generous donation of one hundred dozen pencils. The association's enthusiasm for education is admirable. The original letter is recorded as follows: "Your association's solicitation of pencils, medium-sized calligraphy brushes, and other stationery for charity elementary schools demonstrates a deep respect for charity education. Our association will do our best to make a sincere donation. Of these items, the medium-sized calligraphy brushes are not products of our association's members and cannot be collected. For pencils, we have solicited one hundred dozen from members Shanghai Pencil Factory and Weicheng Pencil Factory, which will be donated. We are sending them in full as requested and hope you will accept them."

Gratitude for Donation

A letter from Mr. Xu Meihua stated: "I lost my wallet a few days ago and it was picked up by Mr. Chen Peiliang of Wufeng Company, who kindly returned it to me. I originally intended to send a thank-you gift of 5,000 yuan, but Mr. Chen firmly refused. Therefore, I am sending the money to your newspaper to be used as a 'charity school fund' for Mr. Chen's benefit. I hope you will accept it."

Continued Receipt of Textbooks

Yesterday, we received old textbooks from the Ji Xiao School, including 28 books donated by Mr. Hu Guocheng and 43 books jointly donated by Qu Haiqin from Class A of the Fifth Grade and Yin Jinfu from Class B of the Sixth Grade of Ren Zhi Elementary School. Thank you.

Brief News

Donation to Old People's Home: A letter from Mr. Yao Qingshou stated: "My wet nurse, Ms. Xu, is from the Shuanglin Township. Her family was originally poor, and after the war, the family was scattered and became homeless, reduced to beggars. Last autumn, someone from the hometown spoke of this matter, and I learned the details. I entrusted him to return to the hometown to search for her, and planned to provide a small monthly allowance. Unexpectedly, after many months, there was no news. Yesterday, I suddenly received confirmation that she had died last summer, wandering aimlessly and filling a ditch. I have been saddened for a long time. I originally planned to provide a small contribution for funeral expenses, but I cannot do so because there is no way to send it. Because I think that there are many people in the world in similar situations, if they can be rescued early and sheltered, they will not end up like this.
