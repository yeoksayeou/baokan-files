### Part of the City of Shuri Breached; Japanese Army Launches Counterattack; Air Force Continues Fierce Assault on Enemy Fleet

Tokyo, 2nd (Central News Agency dispatch) - Fierce fighting continues in the southern part of Okinawa Island. The enemy's main attack is focused on the coast, and they have infiltrated the Japanese army positions between Shuri City and Naha, south of Yonabaru. The Japanese army is launching a fierce counterattack. The Japanese air force, in support, continues to attack enemy fleets around the island, inflicting considerable damage. The enemy's offensive, relying on sheer volume of material, cannot be underestimated. Furthermore, the enemy's mobile force has withdrawn from the Japanese special attack force's range in the Ryukyu waters, attempting to regroup. Their land bases have been repeatedly subjected to fierce attacks by the Japanese air force and the valiant efforts of airborne units, suffering enormous damage. However, they are still exerting all their strength to rebuild their bases. The number of enemy aircraft attacking the entire island chain was over 80 on the 27th, around 90 on the 29th, and around 80 on the 30th. Since June 1st, this has increased to around 200. Fifty enemy aircraft attacked southern Kyushu, indicating that the enemy's base strength has been developed to a considerable extent. The enemy army has suffered significant damage before launching fierce attacks on the Japanese army, but they have still landed a large number of troops on Okinawa and continue to replenish supplies. Approximately eight to ten enemy divisions have landed. To sustain this massive force, their supplies must also increase, so the Japanese special attacks have a significant impact on the enemy.

Southwest Area Base, 2nd (Central News Agency dispatch) - The land battles on Okinawa Island continue to unfold as fierce offensive and defensive engagements in the cities of Shuri and Naha. The enemy is gradually closing in on Japanese positions, attempting to break through. Part of Shuri City has been breached by the enemy. The Japanese army is launching a counterattack, engaging in fierce hand-to-hand combat. Enemy troops in the area are dropping supplies from the air to alleviate supply difficulties.

Southwest Islands Base, 2nd (Central News Agency dispatch) - The weather around Okinawa Island has been poor recently, so aerial operations by both Japanese and American forces have not been active. The activity of enemy aircraft has been as follows: only 70 aircraft attacked Okinawa Island on the 1st, and only 200 aircraft attacked the entire island chain. It appears that the enemy's strength at the airfields in northern and central Okinawa has been gradually increasing.

The Japanese army has steadfastly defended its positions against the overwhelming material strength of the enemy's offensive for more than three weeks, continuing its valiant efforts. The morale of the garrison on the island is rising, and in coordination with the Japanese air force's attacks, they are repeatedly launching fierce hand-to-hand attacks, achieving significant results.

### Scene of a Japanese Airborne Unit's Surprise Attack

Zurich, 2nd (Central News Agency dispatch) - According to a dispatch from Paris, a "correspondent" on Okinawa reported on May 26th, describing the tragic scene of a Japanese airborne unit forcibly landing at an enemy airfield. On the night of the 25th, a Japanese airborne unit suddenly and forcibly landed at an American airfield on Okinawa. At the time, hundreds of American aircraft were parked at the airfield. Japanese airborne troops from Japanese twin-engine bombers rushed into the midst of them. According to the base commander, Lieutenant Colonel Smith's estimation, each Japanese aircraft carried twelve to fifteen soldiers, who carried hand grenades, bombs, and several days' worth of food. As soon as the aircraft landed, the soldiers inside leaped out. An officer in the control tower immediately opened fire, killing a Japanese soldier near the tower, but he himself died from a bayonet wound to the chest. The Japanese air force, in coordination with this airborne unit, heavily bombed the American airfield that night, with the bombing lasting eight hours, the largest bombing since the start of the Okinawa operation.

### Today is June 3rd - Hope the Nation Strictly Enforces the Ban on Opium

Nanjing, 2nd (Central News Agency dispatch) - Today (3rd) is June 3rd, the Opium Suppression Day. Recalling one hundred years ago in 1839 AD, that is, the 19th year of Daoguang, our Governor-General of Guangdong and Guangxi, Lin Zexu, perceived the conspiracy of British and American imperialists to poison China. He resolutely burned over 20,000 boxes of opium belonging to British merchants at Humen, Guangdong. Afterwards, British imperialism used its guns to force us into war, which is the Opium War, a page of tragic history. For over a hundred years, opium was openly imported and freely sold and smoked, draining our finances and numbing our people, leading to the decline of the nation, which is deeply distressing to speak of. In the 24th year of the Republic [1935], our late Chairman Wang Jingwei, while in the Executive Yuan, followed the legacy of the Founding Father Sun Yat-sen to reject poison and promulgated a five-year ban on opium, which was vigorously promoted. Unfortunately, the August 13th Incident occurred soon after, leading to a relaxation. With the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, young people, seeing the difficulties of the time, launched the nationwide December 17th Movement to awaken the national populace and strive for strength. Until March of last year, the National Government reiterated its previous orders and decided to continue rigorously enforcing the ban on opium. A General Bureau for the Prohibition of Opium was specially established under the Ministry of the Interior, with the intention of specialized administration. Later, to further emphasize the promotion of the ban, it was transferred to the Military Affairs Commission. Although it has been over a year, the results obtained are not yet satisfactory. On this occasion of June 3rd, the Opium Suppression Day, we remember Lin Zexu's insightful foresight and deeply hope that the opium suppression authorities will implement it consistently, without the slightest negligence. We further hope that the national populace will awaken from now on and no longer sell or smoke, harming their own lives.

Wuhu, 2nd (Central News Agency dispatch) - With the Opium Suppression Day approaching, the county's youth group department, in order to awaken the public's awareness of this meaningful anniversary, has scheduled a commemorative ceremony at the Youth Center at 9 AM on the morning of the 3rd. All middle and primary school group departments will participate at that time.

### Zhejiang Province Actively Promotes Afforestation

### Repairing and Strengthening the Suzhou-Shanghai Highway is Being Actively Promoted; the Wuxi-Shanghai and Other Lines Will Also Be Repaired

Since its establishment, the Shanghai Repair and Reinforcement Highway Engineering Office has been actively proceeding.

### A Complete Picture of Shenjiang County (Part 1)

— Yu Kun

Land and Water Transportation

Shenjiang County is located in the eastern coastal area, at the confluence of the Huangpu River and the Wusong River into the sea, thirty-five li from Wusong, converging with the Yellow Sea. It borders Fengxian to the south, with the Huangpu River as the dividing line, adjoins Songjiang County to the west, and is adjacent to Shanghai City to the north. The terrain is flat, with no strategic advantages to speak of, only the crisscrossing of rivers and harbors, with the Huangpu River and Hengjing as the main arteries. The Huangpu River flows through the southeastern boundary, and Hengjing runs north through Huazhuang, connecting to Jiading; in addition, Liuleitang, Guantang, and Yutang are all tributaries of the Huangpu River, but Yutang is now silted up and impassable. Furthermore, Zhugangtang and Shagangtang run parallel to Hengjing.

The county's transportation has always been convenient. On land, there is the Shanghai-Minhang Highway, from Shanghai City to Minhang Town within the county, with a total length of sixty-four li. It has fallen into disrepair after the war, and the road surface is quite damaged, causing difficulties for vehicles. Cars take about an hour or so to travel. Currently, there are three companies operating on this route, as far as the reporter knows: one is the Huazhong Long-Distance Bus, with its business office located on Lujiaxiang Road in the Nanshi district of Shanghai, selling tickets for the following routes and operating stations on the Shanghai-Minhang line, passing through Xietu Road, Wujiaxiang, Qianliangmiao, Qiaotou, and Beiqiao from Nanshi to Minhang. The fare from Nanshi to Minhang is 6,500 yuan, from Xietu Road to Minhang is 5,000 yuan, and the rest decreases by station. The departure times from Shanghai are 8:30 AM, 10:30 AM, 1:00 PM, and 2:30 PM, a total of four buses. The second is the Shanghai-Minhang Automobile Company, with its business office on Xietu Road in the Nanshi district, purely using small cars. The fare is 4,400 yuan per person, regardless of distance. Each car can carry six to seven people, and it departs when it is full. The time is not fixed. The third is the Zhonghua Automobile Transportation Company, with its business office located in Lu Road, north of Hubei Road. It also uses small cars, with a fare of 7,000 yuan per person and 45,000 yuan to charter the entire car. Each car can carry seven people. The time is not fixed. It is heard that prices will increase soon.

Water transport is due to bordering the Huangpu River. Before the war, there were countless ferries and weaving ships. Currently, only the Huazhong Inland River Shipping operates, with small ships running on a scheduled basis every day, connecting to Pinghu, Shanghai, and other places. The departure time from Shanghai is 8:00 AM every morning. The boat ticket is 4,000 yuan per person, and it takes four hours to reach Minhang Town. There are also rowing boats for crossing the river, traveling back and forth in the Huangpu River, connecting passengers from Minhang to Caocaojing in Nanhui. If the number of scheduled boats increases in the future, transportation will be even smoother.

Security is the Best

The security of this county is very stable, ranking first among the seven counties in the Shanghai city area (Jiading, Kunshan, Chongming, Shenjiang, Chuansha, Nanhui, Fengxian). There are no communist troops hiding within the territory, and the people appear to be living peacefully. Currently, the Shanghai-Minhang Highway is the boundary. Security teams are stationed to the west of the road, and central tax police are stationed to the east. Along the river and in various district towns, there are also Japanese security forces and police assisting. All members of the troops are rigorously trained and equipped with fine equipment. Furthermore, due to the effective supervision of the commanding officers in the stationed areas, military discipline is solemn, and extortion and other illegal behaviors are rarely heard of. In addition, self-defense corps have been organized in various districts. The corps members have been selected and rigorously trained. Therefore, local bandits and thieves are terrified, and criminal cases have also decreased as a result. Recently, a company of security teams has been practicing diligently outside Minhang Town. Every morning and evening, you can hear them singing military songs and slogans loudly, full of spirit. This painting is definitely not comparable to ordinary military troops.

Farmland and Products; The Soil is Fertile in Mu County

The county's land is fertile, suitable for extreme values, especially along the Pujiang area, with occasional sandy soil, most suitable for planting cotton. The county has approximately 200,000 mu of farmland, with a population of only over 80,000 people. All farmland is first-class superior fertile land, with very little wasteland. Because the land is flat, there are fewer forests, so the price per mu is very expensive. Before the war, the average was around 100 yuan per mu, but now the value is only six dan of rice.

Agriculture in Mu County is dominated by cotton, with a ratio of seven cotton to three rice in the farmland. Approximately one-third of the farmers own their own land, and approximately two-thirds rent land. Since the price of food has soared, the number of those growing grain has increased by three-tenths compared to the past, and the cotton market has changed color. Under the unified political orders of Jiangsu Province, the land tax has been collected since last year. The land tax is stipulated at one dou per mu, collected in two installments, three sheng for the first installment, and seven sheng for the second installment. The land rent is six dou of rice per mu, and forty jin of cotton per mu.

Rice is the main food for the people, but the total rice production of the county, when calculated with the population, is only enough to maintain the population for half a year. It is necessary to purchase rice from [blank] or other places to provide assistance. Therefore, the source of rice all depends on Songjiang, Jinshan, and other places. If the source is cut off, panic will arise. On the day the reporter arrived, the price of rice was only 150,000 yuan. Affected by the Shanghai rice price (185,000), and because Songjiang in the west happened to be within the military rice period, it was difficult to ship out, leading to a gradual increase in the local rice price.

Natural products depend on the suitability of the soil. Now I will describe the general essentials. Types of grains: there are many types of rice, there are two types of wheat, large and small. Buckwheat grains resemble black morning glory seeds. There are two types of beans, yellow and white. After the wheat harvest, they are planted half and half with sesame. Other crops such as millet, mung beans, red beans, broad beans, peas, etc. are all intercropped, and lentils are planted in hedges. Types of vegetables: such as lettuce, loofah are recently widely planted, yam, yellow yam, taro are produced near the Pujiang River in the west of the county. There are many citrus fruits; feathers, [blank], shellfish, and livestock are occasionally available.

Customs and Livelihood; Most of the Local Residents are Farmers

Most of the local residents are engaged in agriculture. The people admire simplicity and frugality and do not have the frivolous habits of Shanghai City. Their clothing, food, and shelter are extremely frugal. Most of their clothes are made of native cloth, but the upper middle class occasionally uses silk. Recently, customs have changed drastically, and the clothing of men and women has gradually become novel, and the habits of smoking and gambling are more prevalent, with more people becoming lazy every day. There are about two or three semi-public selling and smoking places in Minhang Town. The general teahouses sell tea in name, but in reality, they are gathering for gambling. In recent years, it is not uncommon to see good young people in the countryside ruin their families by entering those dens. After the incident, divorce and contract termination cases have also been heard of. People who are illiterate like to [blank] ghost stories and gods. When they encounter illness, they always perform rituals first and then seek medical treatment, sparing no expense. Marriages and funerals all follow astrology. In short, customs are deteriorating day by day, which is a misfortune for society. It is hoped that the authorities will find ways to ban it and actively reform it, which is the blessing of the nation and the local area. (To be continued)

### War Crimes Investigation Committee Meets in London

Stockholm, 2nd (Central News Agency dispatch) - According to the London Gazette, the US representative Jackson, who attended yesterday's meeting of the War Crimes Investigation Committee in London, suggested establishing a "Central War Crimes Record Department" to concentrate war crimes reports collected by various countries. This would eliminate the war crimes investigation departments currently organized separately by sixteen countries, and the military communications department established in the United Nations Command Headquarters, because that organization can only engage in independent investigations, reconnaissance, and recording evidence, and cannot contact or exchange reports with each other.

The Soviet Union Expresses Concern. Stockholm, 2nd (Central News Agency) - According to a broadcast from Moscow Radio: The Soviet government requests that the governments of Britain, the United States, France, and Chongqing actively adopt peaceful methods to mediate the Levant dispute, as this dispute conflicts with the San Francisco Conference.

### Politics and Heretical Sects

— Wu Zhongxing

"Knowing why the world is in such a state of extreme decline, one should reflect and try to save it."

"Today, our duty is to save the people from suffering and create a lasting peace for all generations." - Gu Tinglin

Lessons from Historical Facts

Today's countryside has reached a state of "leaning but not collapsing, breaching but not disintegrating." The recent widely publicized reckless actions of the Wuxi Xiantian Dao (Way of Former Heaven) may be a precursor to the countryside "leaning and about to collapse, breaching and about to disintegrate." We cannot help but sigh at the "degradation of people's hearts" and worry about the peasants "taking risks." The current urgent task is not only to treat the symptoms but, more importantly, to address the root causes; not only to prescribe the right medicine but also to correct the origins and purify the source.

Recalling Chinese history, the practice of burning incense, gathering followers, and collecting rice as contributions to religious sects has a long history. The rebellions led by Zhang Lu and Zhang Jiao of the Han Dynasty, Sun En and Lu Xun of the Jin Dynasty, the Rice Thieves of Sichuan during the Six Dynasties and the Tang Dynasty, Nong Zhigao of the Song Dynasty, Liu Liu, Liu Qi, Zhao Fengzi, Xu Hongru, Tang Sai'er of the Ming Dynasty, and the White Lotus Sect and the Heavenly Reason Sect of the Qing Dynasty were all religious-based rebellions that arose during times of moral decay and were closely related to corrupt politics. While we do not need to overestimate the Xiantian Dao, we cannot ignore the lessons of historical facts.

Taking the well-known White Lotus Sect as an example, it rebelled for nine years, spreading across five provinces. Starting in the first month of the first year of the Jiaqing reign of the Qing Dynasty in Zhijiang and Yidu counties in Hubei Province, it disturbed several provinces, including Henan, Shaanxi, Sichuan, and Gansu, burning every village and town it entered, causing the first major chaos in the mid-Qing Dynasty. This is an undeniable historical fact. A faithful analysis of the reasons at the time reveals the following points:

1.  The corruption of local officials. After the death of Emperor Qianlong of the Qing Dynasty, the crimes of the powerful minister He Kun were exposed. For more than 20 years, he abused his power, engaged in extravagance, engaged in illegal private activities, harmed the country and the people, was greedy for money, and sought bribes, which planted the seeds of civil unrest. Because the local officials had someone above them who favored such behavior, they intensified their actions, leading to "excessive taxes and levies, shifting new debts to cover old ones, and the common people suffering from oppression with no one to care for them."

2.  The latent revolutionary ideas. During the heyday of the Qing Dynasty, although the people had ideas of restoring the Ming Dynasty, they had no way to act. At this time, there was the saying of "Supporting and protecting Niu Ba (牛八)," Niu Ba being a hidden mark for the character "Zhu (朱)," and there was also the saying of "The King of Ming is born," which showed nostalgia for the Ming Dynasty. Some people inevitably manipulated and used these sentiments during the civil unrest.

3.  The incitement of Buddhist legends. At that time, there was the so-called "Three Religions Should Transmit Complete Books (三敎應劫總觀通書)" which claimed that Dipankara Buddha, Sakyamuni Buddha, and Maitreya Buddha were the three kalpas, and used the rebirth of Maitreya Buddha as a slogan. As a result, peasants who were suffering from life were thus confused and recklessly rebelled.

As for the reasons why this kind of upheaval could continue to expand, there are only two points:

1.  The exacerbation by clerks and runners. When the upheaval first started, it was easy to suppress, but the clerks and runners took the opportunity to extort, "not asking whether they practiced the religion or not, only caring whether they paid money or not," thus deepening the peasants' resentment, leading to exacerbation.

2.  The increase in coerced followers. After the upheaval, peasants whose homes were destroyed and property exhausted had no choice but to be coerced into following. As a result, as time went on, more and more people who had no property or food attached themselves to the movement.

In short, the essence of "heretical disturbances," as Mei Zengliang argued: "In the world, there are rebellious people, treacherous people, poisonous officials, who are forced by hunger and cold to raise their blades and rise up, seeking parties and associates to join them in self-preservation. These rebellious people invite the ignorant and old, and call it a religion, which is what treacherous people do... Moreover, the name of religion is not easily accepted by the people from their superiors, but a commoner can obtain it in their hometown, which is not something that the people can do, it is the situation." Therefore, whether we are examining the White Lotus Sect or other disturbances in history, or even today's Xiantian Dao, we must not only pay attention to the evolution of the phenomenon, but most importantly, we must pay attention to the reasons for the formation of the "situation," and we must make plans for "prevention" and "exploiting the situation."

Analysis of Today's Situation

The history of the Xiantian Dao's spread in Jiangnan is still very short, starting in April of the 32nd year of the Republic of China (1943), only two years ago. The disturbances are currently limited to a small part of the countryside of Wuxi and its surrounding counties. Compared with the White Lotus Sect Rebellion and other disturbances, it can be said that it is still in its early stages. Although the "situation" is gradually brewing, we can still "exploit the situation" to gradually quell it.

However, we should pay attention to analyzing the reasons for the current "leaning but not collapsing, breaching but not disintegrating" state of the countryside. Now, while describing the development of the Xiantian Dao, we will point out the root causes of how heretical sects combine with corrupt politics.

1.  The oppression by miscellaneous troops in the countryside. The reason why the leader of a certain group requested the Xiantian Dao to come to Wuxi from North China to spread the teachings was because he suffered from the extortion of the guerrilla teams constantly moving within the borders of Cheng, Xi, and Wu counties, and was in great pain. He then went to Beijing, passed the president of the Xiantian Dao headquarters, and mistakenly believed that the Xiantian Dao was the only way to overcome the rural crisis. Later, the followers of the Xiantian Dao constantly fought against the local resident miscellaneous troops, also because they could not bear the oppression and their resentment filled their hearts.

2.  The influence of Buddhist thought. The Xiantian Dao is also called the "Buddha Power Protection Association," which is very similar to the White Lotus Sect's advocacy of the Maitreya Buddha's rebirth. Because after suffering from heavy oppression, the peasants believe that the only thing they can rely on to be saved is the power of the Buddha. This is the reason why they utilize the inherent beliefs of the people to gain a large number of followers. They even believe in the superstition that after worshiping in front of the incense hall, they can be invulnerable to swords and weapons, which also stems from this point.

3.  The heavy burden of exorbitant taxes and levies. The followers of the Xiantian Dao have repeatedly gathered crowds to attack rural towns' public offices or tax offices, which is due to the fact that the heads of rural towns are not able to win the people's support, and the tax collectors have accumulated resentment from the peasants. The peasants have exceeded the limit of silent endurance of misfortune and have taken extra-legal actions, which is also a common fact in historical upheavals.

4.  Resentment towards those who exploit the collection of rice and grain to extort and do evil. The peasants are not uncooperative with the collection of rice and grain. Firstly, they resent the poor attitude of those who buy the rice and grain, and secondly, they are indignant because they know that the buyers are engaging in corruption. Therefore, when someone raises the flag, hundreds of people respond. The problem with the purchase of rice and grain is not in principle, but in the organization. Today, the peasants are trapped in the tragic situation of "planting two acres of land and sleeping with their heads resting on the yamen," so they also attack the offices responsible for buying rice and grain.

In short, the peasants' belief is not in the theory or organization of the Xiantian Dao, but in rural self-defense. Rural self-defense is their goal, and the Xiantian Dao is merely their means, or rather, a weapon among their lack of options. The reasons why the peasants cause reckless actions can be summarized as, first, the problem of people's livelihood, and second, the problem of education. Because education is not widespread, people's hearts are "fragile," and because people's livelihood is difficult, they "take risks." We believe that to quell the reckless actions of the Xiantian Dao, it is not necessary to suppress them with military force, nor is it necessary to use tricks to appease them. The main thing is to "prescribe the right medicine" for these two points, and then receive the effect of "correcting the origins and purifying the source."

During the White Lotus Sect Rebellion in the mid-Qing Dynasty, Hong Liangji's "Memorial on Suppressing Heretical Sects (征邪教疏)" was very famous. Although Hong Liangji was offended by this and exiled to Yili, Emperor Jiaqing praised it as "not despising Hong Liangji's words, carefully analyzing himself," and Hong Liangji's attitude was indeed standing on the position of worrying about the country and the people, and his plan was also aimed at "correcting the origins and purifying the source." Today, when we examine the Xiantian Dao, we can also bring it up for reference. Hong Liangji's method has three points:

First: Those who are coerced should be shown leniency. Hong Liangji, because he witnessed that the longer the White Lotus Sect Rebellion lasted, the more followers there were, strongly advocated the method of showing leniency to those who were coerced, and said: "Those who kill thousands of people or hundreds of people are just these unemployed vagrants, not true heretics, not true bandits, and there are tens of thousands of them in every prefecture and county. Can they all be killed? Even if they can all be killed, it is not what the benevolence of heaven can bear to do." His arguments are very insightful. The effect of showing leniency to those who are coerced, from the positive side, is to open the way for the foolish people to reform themselves, and from the negative side, it is to separate the followers of the heretical sects. The principle set by Jiangsu Province this time, "on the one hand, severely punishing the leaders of the Xiantian Dao, and on the other hand, advising the deceived people to wake up and know what to do," is indeed a plan to address the root causes.

Second: Officials should be incorruptible. Hong Liangji once discussed the clerks and runners of that time in his Essay on Intentions, believing that they "were enough to control the government from above, enough to bully and threaten the scholar-officials in the middle, and enough to fish and prey on the villages below." He also compared the clerks and runners to tigers and wolves: "The violence of the clerks is like that of tigers. Rather than having dozens or hundreds of tigers in a prefecture or county, it is better to reduce them even more. Today, in the larger prefectures and counties, there are as many as thousands of clerks and runners, followed by seven or eight hundred people, and at least one or two hundred people. These thousands of people to one or two hundred people do not farm when they are men, and do not weave when they are women, and they all rely on the people for food, without a doubt. Generally speaking, ten families of people are not enough to support one clerk, and if there are thousands of clerks, then a city of ten thousand families will also be noisy." His arguments are still relevant today. It is hoped that the authorities will reduce the number of rural technical agencies as much as possible, and strictly select the candidates for the heads of rural towns as much as possible. Anyone who embezzles grain, embezzles military rations, extorts, or takes bribes should be severely punished, so that "the grievances of the people can be relieved, and the mouths of the people can be blocked."

Third: Responsibilities should be assigned. Hong Liangji strongly emphasized the responsibility of those who are in charge of defending the territory, because the White Lotus Sect had spread to five provinces, so he advocated that they must be held specifically responsible. Although the scope of the Xiantian Dao is still small now, the heads of each county should also be held specifically responsible, so as to avoid the situation of "the bandits arrive and the soldiers are nowhere to be seen, and the soldiers come and the bandits disappear without a trace," which was the case during the White Lotus Sect Rebellion, because they were not specifically responsible for defending the territory. Although we do not advocate military conquest, the responsibility for defending the territory must be specifically assigned.

Secondly, the rice and grain purchasing mechanism must be improved, and the exorbitant taxes and levies must be eliminated. The improvement of the rice and grain purchasing mechanism, first, must not cause the peasants to directly feel pain, second, make as much use of the inherent traditional customs of various places as possible, which can be used flexibly, and third, respect the opinions of local gentry and peasants, and purchase at appropriate prices and in appropriate quantities. As for the advantages and disadvantages of exorbitant taxes and levies, they are very obvious, and most of them do not come from the authorities, but are cleverly established by various rural towns and villages, and extorted along the way. It is only necessary for the local authorities to strictly prohibit them, and the disadvantages can be eliminated, which will undoubtedly benefit the peasants.

In short, in today's countryside, when it is "leaning but not collapsing, breaching but not disintegrating," we should try our best to "exploit the situation," that is, even if the reckless actions have already begun, we can still immediately "prescribe the right medicine." Otherwise, as Mei Zengliang argued: "If the people are happy to do something, but we do not guide them to benefit, then in the countryside, there will inevitably be someone who, because of the people's desires, steals our intentions to sell their desires. At first, it is just a private name, wanting wealth, holding small competitions and gradually chasing them, and later it becomes the worry of those who govern the country. As for becoming the worry of those who govern the country, it is not only that those who follow and agree are not happy, but also that the initiators did not initially intend to do this. However, why is it that the situation must reach this point? I will explain it to guide them, I will gather them, and I can disperse them, so the power is on top; the people gather themselves, which is not allowed by the law, and the people know that the intention does not come from above, and they are afraid that the law will reach them, so they naturally have a heart to contend with the top, and their situation is gathered and cannot be dispersed, so it is said that it is not something that the people can do, it is the situation." Although this kind of situation is gradually brewing, we can still start early and diligently implement plans to address the root causes.

Although we do not want to overemphasize the Xiantian Dao, the crux of the matter is not in the phenomenon, but in the root, not in the heretical sect, but in the corrupt politics. To prevent the prairie fire of a single spark, we can only firmly advocate: eliminate corrupt politics, and then eradicate heretical sects. In today's society where the people are struggling to survive, we must not focus on the trivial and neglect the fundamental. We should quickly win back the hearts of the people, reform the institutions, and strive for good governance!

Lisbon, 2nd (Central News Agency) - According to the Madrid Gazette: The French government has formally notified Spain that although the Foreign Affairs Committee of the French National Consultative Assembly has decided to invite all the United Nations to unanimously request General Franco to resign and allow public opinion to establish free general elections, the French government will definitely not attach importance to this decisive suggestion.

### Britain Makes New Proposals to Tito

Seeking to Resolve Territorial Disputes

Zurich, 200th (Central News Agency) - The British military is eager to resolve the Trieste issue and intends to make new proposals to Tito. The Exchange Telegraph Agency's Rome telegram stated that the Allied Commander-in-Chief in the Mediterranean, Alexander, is scheduled to meet with Tito in Belgrade on June 2nd to resolve the Trieste dispute. At that time, if the Yugoslav army guarantees the safety of the transportation lines, the British side will express its intention to withdraw its troops from the eastern part of the Istrian Peninsula. However, in order to maintain the Austrian garrison, the British army cannot abandon Trieste, and is eager to establish an Anglo-American military government in the Trieste and Gorizia regions, so Tito may not simply accept Alexander's reconciliation.

### The Provincial Government of Jiangsu Orders a Crackdown on Uninspected Weights and Measures

Suzhou, 2nd (Central News Agency)

Weights and measures in rural counties and townships are sold at will without following the law, which is enough to disrupt the implementation of measurement administration. Therefore, the weighing and measurement inspection divisions of various counties have successively submitted requests to the provincial inspection office, which forwarded them to the provincial government, ordering various counties to instruct the village chiefs and ward heads to crack down on them in order to facilitate standardization. The provincial government has now issued an order to various counties to comply, requiring that all products be sent to the local competent authority for inspection before they can be sold.

### British Policy Towards India Determined; Governor-General Wavell Returns to His Post

Lisbon, 2nd (Central News Agency) - Since Governor-General Wavell of India returned to his country on March 23rd, he has repeatedly discussed the Indian issue with Prime Minister Churchill, Attlee, and others. However, due to the end of the European War, the opening of the San Francisco Conference, and major changes in the international situation, the Indian issue could not be resolved satisfactorily. Recently, the British government's policy towards India has been decided, so Wavell returned to his post by air on the 1st of this month. The policy that has been decided has not yet been announced. Reuters recently commented on Wavell's return to his post, reporting that Wavell will use full authority to deal with all obstacles in India and guide the Indians to the right path.

Stockholm, Sweden, 2nd (Central News Agency) - According to a report from London, Governor-General Wavell of India departed for India yesterday after holding talks with the British government for several weeks. According to a political correspondent from Reuters, the political circles in London deeply believe that Wavell's visit to Britain must have been to study how to break the political deadlock in India and discuss how to obtain cooperation between the ruling Indian parties and leaders.

As he is about to leave Shanghai, he invited reporters yesterday to give a speech, saying: "Since I took office, although it has only been a little over a year, I have made every effort to reform all aspects of the office. For those who have committed minor crimes, I have tried my best to implement bail within the possible scope, thus reducing the overcrowding in the detention center. In the past, the Shanghai Judicial Police Force had an independent nature, and the drawbacks were inevitable. It was affiliated to the Local Procuratorate, and I concurrently served as the captain to command it. I am still satisfied with the results. After I leave Shanghai, the position of Chief Prosecutor will be filled by the Chief Prosecutor of our Office, Sun Jiajie. There will be no changes in all internal personnel matters."

### The Shipping Industry is Dispatched to Transport Rice and Grain

According to news from the shipping industry yesterday, the industry was granted a special permit by the relevant authorities to dispatch several ships to various ports in northern Jiangsu on the previous two days to transport supplies because of the soaring food prices and the seriousness of the people's food problems in the city. It is reported that a large amount of rice, soybeans, and wheat will be shipped to Shanghai within days.

### The Rationing of China Tobacco is Decided to Change; All Retail Cigarette Stores are Abolished

The rationing of China Tobacco, after being planned and changed by the authorities, now has a concrete plan determined. The retail cigarette stores in the city will be abolished from this month to actively reorganize them. At the same time, the monthly delivery period and quantity will also be re-regulated, which will be implemented once approved by the competent authorities.

### This Period's Household Flour to be Sold Starting on the 7th, One Catty per Certificate

The Municipal Goods Rationing Office has been ordered to be abolished, and all rationing matters have been transferred to the Municipal Economic Bureau to handle. The Bureau, in view of the recent surge in rice prices and the threat to the people, in addition to actively planning to stabilize the rice market, and to alleviate the people's food panic, has prepared for the sale of this period's household flour, which will be sold starting next Thursday (June 7th) to the 12th of the same month. At that time, all households will be required to present the No. 47 Comprehensive Rationing Certificate to purchase one catty of flour from the designated merchants at a price of 400 yuan in national currency.

### The Recent Movement of Materials is Smooth

The recent inflow and outflow of materials is still smooth. Although there are no statistics to compare the quantity of exported and imported materials from Central China, South China, North China, and Huaihai, according to news from the Material Movement Application Permit Office and the Shanghai Office of the Material Control Review Committee, recently, all applications for material movement permits and the joint review procedures have been faster than before. The period for the rejection or approval of documents and decisions is at most one week, and the fastest is only one or two days. In Shanghai, sacks and blue products are the most imported, followed by important materials from various places. The most exported goods to Central China, South China, and Huaihai are pigments, followed by daily necessities and major commodities. However, the insufficient supply of transportation vehicles has a great impact on the export and import of materials. It is hoped that the authorities will find a way to solve this matter as soon as possible.

### Deferred Clearing of Negotiable Instruments: Impractical

Regarding the proposal by the Chinese Bankers' Association and the Foreign Bankers' Association for deferred clearing of negotiable instruments, initially, its implementation was earnestly anticipated to alleviate financial difficulties. However, after deliberation by the Money Dealers' Association, it has been indicated that they cannot agree to it. It is understood that while banking peers generally support the idea, the dissent from the money dealers makes its implementation practically impossible. This is because there are extensive exchanges of negotiable instruments between banks and money shops. If banks implement deferred clearing independently while money shops continue same-day clearing, the obstacles will be even greater.

### Establishment of the Civil Air Defense Training Institute Alumni Association
