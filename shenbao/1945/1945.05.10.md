### Many Difficulties in Cooperation Between the Kuomintang and the Chinese Communist Party

Mao Zedong Declares

Central News Agency Report - According to intelligence: At the Seventh National Congress of the Communist Party of China, Mao Zedong criticized the Kuomintang and stated that there are many difficulties in the future of cooperation between the Kuomintang and the Chinese Communist Party. The main points of his remarks are as follows: "After the end of the war, the direction in which China should move will inevitably become a problem. According to some people, China should return to its old state, that is, a semi-colonial, feudal country without independence, freedom, or unified special rights. This is actually the claim of the reactionary group in the Kuomintang. If China proceeds along this path, it will be unfortunate for the entire country and for the entire world. If the 450 million Chinese people reach this state, then another world war will inevitably break out. The people of China and the people of the whole world should prevent China from moving in this direction. According to another group of people, China will not return to its old state in the future. In the future, a new nation with independent, unified, free democracy will be constructed. This is what our Chinese Communist Party hopes for the whole of China and the whole world. If China can move forward along this path, it will be happiness not only for the Chinese people but also for the people of the world. The Chinese people should work harder to guide China in this direction."

### U.S. Under Secretary of State Grew Broadcasts

Lisbon, 8th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - According to a dispatch from Washington, U.S. Under Secretary of State Grew delivered a broadcast speech on the 8th, stating in brief: "As long as a strong Japan still exists, we cannot say that we have won victory. The American people and their allies must devote all their strength to the war in the Pacific. We have won a victory in the Eastern Hemisphere, but on a global scale, we are still at war and have not yet achieved victory. Germany has been defeated, but another country has been preparing for a long time. Japan, regardless of men, women, old, or young, are each responsible for killing American soldiers. Therefore, we must also change our approach. Vast resources are still in Japanese hands. The Japanese islands have millions of combatants. The location of military factories is also very important. Material storage is extremely abundant, and its entire people contribute everything to the fighting forces."

Editorial

### Dynamic Japanese Politics

Hitler has died a martyr, Mussolini has been murdered, and Germany has surrendered. Today, the essence of World War II has become clearer: the focus of this World War is not in Europe, but in our Greater East Asia.

In the war to defend Greater East Asia, the fate of China and Japan are intertwined. Japan's fate has a tremendous impact on China's future. Therefore, the war news from Japan is of concern to our people, and the domestic political trends in Japan are also of deep interest to our people.

However, we should observe Japanese politics from two perspectives: the first is the static aspect, and the second is the dynamic aspect. The static aspect can be simply explained: the essence of Japanese politics is based on the Japanese national polity; in other words, the Japanese nation is centered on the unbroken line of Emperors. Therefore, although Japanese politics seems to be full of turbulent waves and endless changes on the surface, its mainstream is inherited in one continuous line. As for dynamic phenomena, although they are very complex, we can understand all complex political forms clearly and consistently by starting from this unchanging essence. Even contradictory phenomena can be resolved by tracing back to the source and seeking a common goal.

Now, we do not need to list historical facts from Japan to prove this; we can simply analyze the recent Japanese political phenomena to understand this.

When the news that General Suzuki was ordered to form a cabinet came out, the general public seemed to be quite shocked. However, this cabinet reshuffle was indeed a necessary development process for Japan to strengthen its wartime system and achieve its war goals. Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the development from the decisive Tojo cabinet to the Koise cabinet, which advocated great harmony, and then to the Suzuki cabinet today, which concentrates human and material resources to make a final decision on the mainland, is very natural. All the facilities of the Tojo cabinet were swift and decisive. Therefore, the continuing Koise cabinet strived to be pragmatic. However, when the Koise cabinet, which strived to be pragmatic, reached the critical moment of the imminent mainland decisive battle and the rapid changes in the world situation, it could not but be entrusted to General Suzuki, who bore the heavy expectations of the entire Japanese nation, to take on this important task.

Japanese politics is pluralistic, with the power of senior statesmen, the power of parliament, the power of bureaucrats, and even the power of the army and navy. In the past modern political history, cabinet changes were often the result of the rise and fall and mutual competition of these forces. However, since the Greater East Asia War, it has taken the opposite path. These pluralistic forces have gradually concentrated, and the tendency of concentration has become more apparent with each cabinet reshuffle. The collaborative cabinet formation of Koiso and Yonai was a manifestation of the army and navy's unity. The formation of the Greater Japan Political Association was an expression of the parliament's power and the cooperation of other civilian labor forces with the government. This time, Kujyo Harutsune, who emerged from the planning era of the national defense state during the Kishi era, was appointed as the Chief Cabinet Secretary, which further indicates that the core new bureaucrats in the government, who are not well understood by foreigners, are now working harder and determined to strengthen the government's structure. Therefore, although the Tojo cabinet, the Koise cabinet, and the Suzuki cabinet inevitably have some differences in policy, they are consistent in the process of concentrating political power, transforming the plural into the singular.

Secondly, why, in a Japan with so many wise counselors and fierce generals, would they want to invite the elderly General Suzuki to form a cabinet? Simply put, because General Suzuki is determined to devote his life to the war and dedicate himself to the imperial family. Because he devoted himself to the war in his early years and has never held any political positions, he is now able to unite various forces. Also, because he has devoted himself to the imperial family for many years, serving as chamberlain for a long time, he has gained deep trust within the palace on the one hand, and his spirit of loyalty to the country has long been known to the people, so he is now able to implement the spirit of unity between the emperor, officials, and people.

In short, the nature of the current Suzuki cabinet can be compared as follows: in the storm of international war, an experienced helmsman is at the helm, and the best players from all sides are using their full vitality and courageous spirit to break through this turbulent ferry crossing.

Japan's fate is closely related to China's future. We should strengthen our beliefs, and we should have a shared boat

As for if someone asks what Prime Minister Suzuki's views are on China, we can use the following example to answer: It is said that after the enemy planes first blindly bombed Tokyo on March 10, a fire also broke out near the Chinese embassy in Japan. The first to go to the Chinese embassy to express his condolences was a purple "Council 1" car. Sitting in the car was the then-Chairman of the Privy Council, Suzuki, who needless to say is the current Prime Minister Suzuki.

### The Turning Point of the Pacific War: The Decisive Battle of Okinawa

Enemy America's Ambitions

Since Enemy America began its invasion of the Mariana Islands, a new direction in its intention to invade and plunder has become evident. From landing on Leyte, invading Luzon, seizing Iwo Jima, and up to the recent battle for Okinawa Island itself, Enemy America believes that Japan's war power has reached its limit, and thus continues to engage in adventurous combat operations. They believe that the Japanese army has suffered severe blows, and they are grasping for control of the sea and air. Is this erroneous tactic, is Japan's war power really as Enemy America imagines? Japan's response is the stern implementation of continuous attacks by special attack units by sea and land around Okinawa Island.

Enemy America sent this mobile force to invade the Nansei Islands, forcibly landing on Okinawa Island, employing its consistent tactical ideology from the Pacific island battles, adopting a local absolute superiority doctrine, in order to occupy a point off Kyushu, vainly hoping to cut off the supply lines. Enemy America has underestimated Japan's war power, and intends to settle the Pacific war with this one battle. This point is evidenced by their mobilization of their entire main force. From the enemy's perspective, this adventurous attack is no different from preparing for a direct invasion of the Japanese mainland.

A Major Military Taboo

The Okinawa battle is indeed critical. How this battle is won or lost can truly affect the decisive battles to come. Therefore, the decisive battle of Okinawa plays a significant role in the Greater East Asia War.

Since ancient times, the side with fewer mistakes in war has always been victorious. Enemy America's misjudgment of Japan's war power in launching this attack is truly a fatal error. Their direct supply bases are only reliant on Ulithi and Leyte, and their operational disadvantages are undeniable. In any case, the combat conditions are all favorable to Japan.

The decisive battle of Okinawa is also the decisive battle of aircraft. The trend of air control is enough to determine victory or defeat. The output from all of Japan's aircraft factories is now being directly used on the Okinawa front. The Japanese army on the island not only has ample food and ammunition, but also has suffered very few losses, and has hundreds of thousands of residents assisting in the fighting. Therefore, the decisive battle of Okinawa is truly a good opportunity to change the situation of the Pacific War. Enemy America, due to its miscalculations, has finally committed the major military taboo of venturing deep with an isolated force.

Since April 6th, due to the active role of the Japanese army's special sea and land attack units, the enemy's main mobile force has suffered heavy blows, and the number of enemy carrier-based fighters has also been greatly reduced. Although Enemy America has occupied the northern and central airfields on the island and gathered about a hundred small aircraft, they cannot be utilized effectively due to strict restrictions imposed by the Japanese army. And for the approximately four divisions of troops that have already landed, it is necessary to provide desperate relief due to the fierce attacks by the Japanese air force, otherwise, they risk being annihilated by the Japanese army. In short, since landing on Okinawa, Enemy America has encountered its biggest difficulty.

Dawn of Victory

Looking back at the course of the Battle of Leyte Island, the most regrettable thing is that the war power Japan injected was insufficient. When the trend of air control had not been decided, the Japanese and American sides both fought desperately, vying for dominance over the skies of Leyte Island. In the meantime, due to the forced landing of the Japanese airborne troops and the Takachiho parachute unit in November of last year, the war situation once favored the Japanese side. After these two units landed on Leyte, the balance between the two sides was broken, and it was an excellent opportunity to regain air control over Leyte. Unfortunately, subsequent support was lacking, creating a danger of [being cut off]. However, from Kyushu to Okinawa is only about 300 kilometers, so the Japanese air fleet is braving bad weather and deploying every day. This point is different from the decisive battle of Leyte and is favorable to Japan. The B29 bombers bombing Japanese aircraft factory groups, as well as the enemy carrier-based aircraft groups' sudden attacks on Japanese airfields, are also sufficient to show the subtle dynamics between them.

Enemy's Supply Difficulties

Enemy America landed four divisions on Okinawa Island. Calculating at nine tons per person, 500,000 tons of supply ships per month is absolutely the minimum required, and they should not miss the good opportunity. Currently, the situation of the decisive battle of Okinawa is similar to the Battle of Leyte. Due to the precious sacrifices of the special underwater attack units, battleships, etc., and the desperate efforts of the land, sea, and air forces, the enemy's powerful mobile force has been mostly destroyed. Today's situation is exactly the same as the opportunity to change the war situation created when the Kaoru and Takachiho units forcibly landed. Can this good opportunity be seized? The success or failure of the decisive battle of Okinawa depends on the size of the war power recently injected, that is, the number of aircraft.

Supplies from Manila to Leyte often did not arrive en route. Moreover, the distance of its supply is farther than to the Mariana or Leyte Islands, and it is constantly threatened by Japanese submarines along the way. At the same time, Japanese kamikaze special attack planes and special underwater attack units are gathering around Okinawa, waiting for opportunities to launch fierce attacks. The enemy's mobile force has been greatly damaged in order to protect its friendly forces. As a result, it has only been able to rely on specially equipped aircraft carriers for escort, but recently, in the war results announced by the Japanese army, the number of specially equipped aircraft carriers sunk or destroyed is considerable. The enemy's troops on Okinawa Island will eventually become hostages, and Enemy America will regret it! For Japan, Enemy America's four divisions will become a tempting bait to lure out all enemy ships.

So far, no major movements have been seen on the Okinawa front. The Japanese army is either luring the enemy into an ambush and annihilating them in one fell swoop, or breaking through the center of the enemy's line in one breath with the main force, seizing the initiative of ground combat, and rapidly launching ghostly hand-to-hand combat, achieving the amazing results announced by the Imperial Headquarters. The enemy also knows that future losses will inevitably increase.

The Japanese army's ground units have fully prepared food and ammunition, and are supported by hundreds of thousands of Okinawa residents, with high morale and soaring ambition. Although the battlefield has expanded from north of Nago to in front of Shuri, there are fierce Japanese melee troops everywhere. The 5,000 enemy troops who landed in the Nago area cannot move due to the heavy pressure from the Japanese army, and countless enemy bodies are abandoned in front of the main Japanese army positions in the south. Since the night of April 12th, the Japanese army has launched a simultaneous offensive from the northern Shuri area, fiercely attacking the enemy troops who are constructing defensive positions. Taking advantage of the chaos in their lines, they sent a large number of melee troops to infiltrate their ranks, disrupting their interior and achieving great results.

Dilemma

Enemy America's common tactic for attacking islands in the ocean is to launch continuous fierce attacks with all its strength. For example, in the past in the Saipan and Iwo Jima areas, they used ships to encircle them on all sides, supplemented by fierce naval gun bombardment. However, the attack on Okinawa Island is more moderate than in the past. This is because the enemy army has suffered deeply from the continuous attacks by the Japanese land and sea special attack units. Before the start of the Okinawa Island operation, Enemy America gathered an estimated seven divisions of troops from Leyte to Ioroshima and Saipan, of which four divisions had already landed on Okinawa. Afterwards, in preparation for the next operation, Enemy America again mobilized troops domestically. So far, in the first line of Saipan and Leyte, their accumulated strength is estimated to be nearly ten divisions. However, although they knew that they could not advance and attack Okinawa with the strength of four divisions alone, they still could not send reinforcements. What is the reason for this? There is no other reason than the strict surveillance of the Japanese special attack units, which makes it impossible for them to act rashly.

The mobile force has suffered heavy blows, and the four divisions that have already landed cannot be abandoned. They must continue to find ways to supply them, at great risk, under the fierce attacks of the Japanese special attack units. This is Enemy America's greatest suffering. In order to break through this dilemma, they must acquire an air base on Okinawa Island and gather land-based aircraft to prevent the counterattack of the Japanese special attack aircraft. The reason why Enemy America is desperately repairing the airfields they have already obtained in that area today, and is thirsting to seize new airfields, is for this reason.

### Facing the Harsh Reality, Not Entertaining Illusions

Doenitz Broadcasts to the Germans

Stockholm, Sweden, 9th (Central News Agency dispatch) Grand Admiral Dönitz broadcast to the Germans yesterday from the Flensburg radio station, saying: "We must endure the harsh facts of the current situation. In my first speech on May 1st, I stated that my job was to save the lives of the Germans, but I dare not guarantee that I will ultimately be able to help you. The National Socialist Party no longer exists. From now on, there will be no more party-state unity. The foundation of Germany's previous nation-building has now disappeared. During the period of occupation in Germany, power was transferred to the occupying forces. Whether I and the government I appointed can perform our duties depends entirely on their decisions. The war ended one hour before midnight on May 8th, and the German army has stepped onto the road to being captured. This is the final sacrifice for the lives of German women and children and the future of Germany. We express our respect for the heroism that we have shown to them thousands of times. We pledge to never forget the dead and the captured. I promise the Germans that, within the scope of my authority, I will give them possible living conditions, but during this difficult period, I still do not know what I should do to help you. But we should face the facts and not entertain illusions. If my continued tenure is helpful to the motherland, I will do so until the Germans have the opportunity to express their will to appoint a new head of state, or until the occupying authorities make it impossible for me to continue in office. The Germans have a difficult future, and we must move forward with dignity. We should have the will to work hard. If we lack this will, there is no basis for future life. I am determined to stand side by side with the Germans. If my responsibility requires me to remain in office, then I will take steps to retire with the heart of serving Germany and the Germans."

### Issuing Gold Certificates Helps Suppress Price Levels; Central Reserve Bank's Kimura Kobun Issues Statement

After the Central Reserve Bank issued gold certificates, Dr. Kimura Sotaro, advisor to the bank, specially answered questions on the nature of the country's currency inflation, future trends, and the significance of issuing gold certificates in the Japanese-language Continental News. It is translated and published below:

### Inflation Is Absolutely Not Malignant

(Question) Currently, all countries around the world are in a state of war, and they all have a tendency towards inflation. What is your view on inflation in our country?

(Answer) Although there is a tendency towards inflation in the Central China area, its progress and depth, compared with other countries, is still in a very preliminary stage of inflation. In short, it is not malignant, and it will absolutely not lead to malignant inflation. There are two reasons for this: one is based on the ancient history of China, and the other is based on China's current economic strength. China issued paper money as early as a thousand years ago, and was originally the world's oldest country to use paper currency. It has experience in the excessive issuance of paper money many times throughout its history. Paper money was already issued during the Tang and Song dynasties. Although malignant inflation occurred during the Yuan dynasty due to the excessive issuance of paper money, the economic problem was the biggest reason why the Yuan dynasty's military achievements did not last for ten generations and eventually collapsed in less than seventy or eighty years. There were also many examples of this in the Ming dynasty. In the early Qing dynasty, although restrictions were placed on the issuance of paper money, excessive issuance of paper money reappeared during the Zhengde era. With this long history of experience, the Chinese people already know how to protect themselves against inflation, and have unknowingly cultivated a great power. Furthermore, from the current situation, China is one of the world's leading countries in terms of material wealth, and we absolutely do not believe that economic bankruptcy will occur due to inflation. If we compare China's current situation with the inflation during the First European War, the situation in Germany in the autumn of 1922 was quite similar to the situation in Central China in the autumn of last year. However, in May 1923, the inflation in Germany progressed extremely rapidly. In May of this year, the situation in Central China was not as dramatically changed as in Germany. The price of goods in Central China has been high for seven years now, while Germany only experienced a short period of four years before its inflation fell into extreme deterioration. The situation in China is not like this. However, if we therefore think that we can be indifferent to studying countermeasures against inflation, or even be complacent and take it as optimistic, then that would be a grave mistake.

### Gold Certificates and Countermeasures Against Price Increases

(Question) What is the relationship between issuing gold certificates and countermeasures against price increases? (Answer) Recently, due to the evolution of the war situation and other various factors, the form of price fluctuations has greatly changed. In January of this year, public concern was focused on goods, but now it is focused on some speculative commodities, especially gold bars. The speed of general price increases is actually slower compared to last year. Even if this trend is artificially induced, it will not cause much hindrance. Of course, the impact of the rise in gold bars on general prices cannot be ignored, but judging from the recent trend of price increases, it has indeed slowed down. It is ideal to simultaneously suppress both the price of gold and the price of other goods, but it is very difficult to suppress all prices. The original purpose of selling gold certificates was to recover paper money and reduce the amount of paper money in circulation, which is to suppress prices. The price of gold bars has always been prone to skyrocketing, and this issuance of gold certificates is to regulate it. It can be said to be an appropriate measure for the current situation.

(Question) Where is the gold held by the Gold Certificate Issuance Reserve Management Committee stored?

(Answer) After the gold certificates are sold, the gold will be transferred to the management committee and stored within the former Joint Reserve Committee of Silver Firms to reassure the people to purchase them.

(Question) Why are gold certificates divided into one-tael, five-tael, and ten-tael denominations?

(Answer) There is no special meaning. It is only to facilitate general purchases.

(Question) Why is the sales period limited to only three days? Is it too short?

(Answer) This is only the first sale. There will be continued sales in the future. Although the period is short, there is nothing to worry about. If the time is extended, the daily selling price must be changed at any time. A fixed three-day period ensures that there can be a uniform selling price for at least three days without having to change it at any time.

### The Black Market for Gold Bars May Become Clear

(Question) Will gold certificates be publicly listed?

(Answer) They will be listed on the Shanghai Stock Exchange within two or three days, and powerful individuals will be designated as brokers. Using the selling price of gold certificates to regulate the gold market, the long-term black market for gold bars should soon become clear. If gold certificates can circulate sufficiently, it is deeply believed that they will have a very good impact on resisting price increases. As for countermeasures against inflation, all countries in the world have experience. Although they have been explored from various angles, ultimately, the first priority is to recover the currency that has flowed out. Whether it is increasing taxes, encouraging savings, or issuing public bonds, the purpose is to recover currency. The purpose of issuing gold certificates this time is also the same. We firmly believe that it will have a considerable positive effect on improving prices in China, especially in Shanghai.

### The First Phase of Gold Certificates - Merchants and the Public Are Eager to Purchase - 5,000 Taels Sold on the Last Day

The Shanghai Branch of the Central Reserve Bank began selling the first phase of gold certificates from the 7th to the 9th of this month. Various silver firms and citizens in the city went to the bank to purchase them very enthusiastically. The 9th was the last day of the first phase of sales, and the purchasers were even more crowded. The number of sales reached approximately 5,000 taels, more than double the number of sales on the 7th and 8th, which shows the faith of merchants and the public in gold certificates. This is because the Central Reserve Bank's issuance of gold certificates this time is backed by a full amount of gold reserves, and a management committee composed of powerful officials and civilians has been established to be responsible for management. Gold can be redeemed at any time one month after the issuance period. At the same time, the public is allowed to establish a market for free trading. This kind of liquid investment path is what merchants and the public are happy to buy. It is reported that the bank will deliver the number of gold certificates sold on the 7th, 8th, and 9th and the full amount of reserve gold to the Issuance Reserve Management Committee for safekeeping, so that they can be redeemed when they mature on June 8th.

### Yesterday Was the 17th Anti-Aircraft Day - Various Drills Were Held - Strict Traffic and Lighting Controls Were Implemented

Yesterday (the 9th) was the 17th Anti-Aircraft Day. The Municipal Civil Defense Headquarters, as usual, expanded the publicity of the significance of air defense and implemented various air defense drills. The whole day was in a state of air defense, and the atmosphere was extremely tense. The details are recorded as follows:

Alarm Drill

This temporary alarm drill did not sound the alarm, but implemented various telegraphic communication drills such as commands and flag displays. At 10:00 a.m., a drill was conducted to issue a warning alarm. At 10:30 a.m., a drill was conducted to issue an air raid alarm. The copper drums that transmitted the alarm rang throughout the city, and small red flags waved in various districts. All police and Baojia personnel were dispatched to strictly enforce traffic control. Except for vehicles with the "Emergency" sign, all military vehicles were prohibited from passing and were parked on the side of the road. Those who were unlucky were allowed to drive on the left side of the street after stopping for ten minutes. At 11:00 a.m., a drill was conducted to lift the air raid alarm, and vehicles resumed driving. At 12:00 noon, a drill was conducted to lift the warning alarm. At 2:00 p.m., a drill was conducted to issue a warning alarm. At 4:00 p.m., a drill was conducted to lift the warning alarm. At 8:00 p.m., a drill was conducted to issue a warning alarm again. Baojia personnel from various districts were dispatched to check unshielded lights and implement warning light control. At 9:00 p.m., a drill was conducted to issue an air raid alarm. Xiao Benzhenyilang, the section chief of the Air Defense Section of the Police Bureau, Deputy Section Chief Li Zhensheng, Traffic Section Chief Shan Tong, Deputy Section Chief Qingmu and others personally led police officers to carry out strict traffic and lighting controls together with all police officers and Baojia personnel of the second division of various sub-bureaus. Unshielded lights were also completely extinguished, and the entire city was in a state of darkness. All entertainment venues stopped music and performances. Police officers and Baojia personnel patrolled the streets. If any light leakage was found, the house number would be recorded and the power would be cut off. They also checked vehicle lights, and if there were any violations, they would be taken to the police station for processing. At 10:00 p.m., a drill was conducted to lift the air raid alarm. At 11:00 p.m., a drill was conducted to lift the warning alarm, and the entire city was restored to brightness.

In addition, when various alarms were issued, various districts designated locations to carry out comprehensive drills. Factories and buildings carried out indoor and outdoor air defense drills, and the Baojia authorities in various districts checked air defense equipment and organized necessary supplies such as air raid shelters and air defense wells.

Local Drill

This comprehensive drill in the local area was held in the areas under the jurisdiction of the Jing'an Temple, Jiangning Road, and Putuo Road sub-bureaus. The three sub-bureaus designated appropriate locations yesterday, including 13 locations in Jing'an Temple, 3 locations in Jiangning Road, and 25 locations in Putuo Road, to carry out comprehensive drills such as evacuation, firefighting, rescue, and alarm transmission from 10:00 a.m. to 11:00 p.m. The Air Defense Headquarters and the Police Headquarters sent personnel to the site to inspect. Yao Ruifeng, Shou Yuan, and Dou Zhihai, the heads of the respective sub-bureaus, together with the heads of various sections, served as commanders and dispatched all Baojia air defense personnel in various districts to participate in the exercises. Citizens also participated, so the entire area of the three districts was filled with smoke and fire, and the sound of firecrackers echoed in the sky, creating a realistic situation.

Civil Defense Drill

In addition, the Huangpu and Laoza districts conducted comprehensive drills on alarm transmission, evacuation, fire prevention, rescue, and other aspects of air defense at the junction of the two districts on Shaanxi Road from 2:00 p.m. to 4:00 p.m., with citizens participating in the exercises. Each shop on the street dispatched three people, who were guided by police chiefs and Baojia personnel. The two sub-bureau chiefs, Xiao Lin and Xu Zhengshou, and deputy sub-bureau chiefs Liu Yaying and Yi Zhongda, together with Shen Hua and other section chiefs, served as commanders. The Air Defense Headquarters also sent personnel to the site to inspect. This was a thorough civil defense drill, so the exercises were carried out very seriously.

Social Services

### Chinese Health Association Stipulates

Free Artificial Pneumothorax Method

The White Light Lady's concert held at the Lyceum Theater on the 5th of this month was hosted by the Shanghai Concert Association. The income, after deducting expenses, will all be allocated to the Anti-Tuberculosis Fund of the Chinese Health Association. It is estimated that the total income will reach at least 5 million yuan. Part of the honorary tickets from the first show, totaling 3.48 million yuan, has been allocated by the concert to the Chinese Health Association, and it has been requested that the association first organize free artificial pneumothorax treatment. The number of people is set at 100, and each person will be allocated 50,000 yuan as annual treatment expenses. The application methods are as follows:

All: (A) students, teachers, and education professionals, (B) employees of companies and workers of factories, are eligible to apply. All applicants must have an X-ray proof from a doctor or hospital, and only those who are suitable for artificial pneumothorax treatment will be considered temporarily. Serious illnesses are not included in this example. Treatment must last at least one year and must not be interrupted without reason. No fees will be charged during this period. Applications can be made through the Social Services Department of this newspaper.

In this extraordinary period, tuberculosis is rampant, which is truly alarming, and all sectors have a deep understanding of the importance of eradicating tuberculosis. This further implementation of treatment by the Health Association is of great benefit to public health. The association, in addition to expressing its deep gratitude to the ticket purchasers of the concert, also has unpaid donations for purchased goods. Please send them directly to the association at 996 Jing'an Temple Road to conclude the matter. Every 50,000 yuan can save one person from tuberculosis, which is particularly meaningful.

### Enthusiastic Charity Education

Since the number of students enrolled in the Charity Elementary School of this newspaper has increased and new classes have been added, there is still a shortage of elementary school national standard textbooks, so we are soliciting donations from all sectors. Yesterday, Mr. Yu Yaozong generously donated 20,000 yuan to purchase textbooks. Mr. Yu's enthusiasm for charity education is admirable.

Donations of Money and Books
