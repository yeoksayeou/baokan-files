### Completing National Unification with New Awareness and New Action: Speech by Acting Chairman Chen on the War Participation Commemoration Day

Nanjing, 9th (Central News Agency) – Yesterday (the 9th) was the second anniversary of the National Government's participation in the war. As the Greater East Asia War enters its decisive phase, the people of the capital are overjoyed to celebrate this great historical day. All businesses and residents throughout the city are hanging national flags to mark the occasion. Important streets are covered with banners fluttering in the wind, and shop windows are decorated with propaganda slogans, creating a colorful scene. Theaters are also speeding up the screening of propaganda slides to boost public awareness of the war effort. In the afternoon, young people launched a "War Participation Day National Frugality Movement," going to areas such as Fuzimiao, Sanshan Street, and Xinjiekou to widely encourage and promote the strengthening of war spirit. The whole city was filled with a fervent pro-war atmosphere, deeply felt.

Speech by Acting Chairman Chen

Nanjing, 9th (Central News Agency) – Today marks the second anniversary of the National Government's participation in the Greater East Asia War. On this day of great significance, I solemnly reiterate the National Government's determination.

East Asian Nations Unite in Cooperation

Recalling November 2nd of last year, when I assumed office as Acting Chairman of the National Government, I stated that the Chinese Kuomintang, when reorganized in 1924, issued the declaration of the First National Congress, advocating an independent foreign policy to abolish unequal treaties. Dr. Sun Yat-sen's will also urged comrades to realize the abolition of unequal treaties in the shortest possible time to show the nation. These all represent the consistent aspiration of Dr. Sun Yat-sen and the comrades of the Chinese Kuomintang to oppose imperialism on behalf of the entire Chinese people and seek freedom and equality for China. In July 1925, the National Government was established in Guangzhou and advocated a stand against Britain alone, and even the participation in the Greater East Asia War on January 9th of last year, was based on the purpose of opposing imperialism and seeking China's liberation. Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, although Britain and the United States have suffered repeated setbacks, they still have no intention of abandoning their illegal interests in China. Recently, the British Secretary of State even declared in the House of Commons that Britain has no intention of abandoning Hong Kong. It can be seen that without defeating British and American imperialism, there is no possibility of liberation for China and all of East Asia. The National Government participated in the Greater East Asia War last year to fight for justice, for liberation, and even more for Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Pan-Asianism. No matter how the war progresses or how urgent the situation becomes, the military and civilians of the whole country will not waver. In the future, all East Asian nations should cooperate further to strive for the final victory. Indeed, opposing imperialism is the long-cherished aspiration of the National Government and the determination of the entire Chinese people. Based on this determination, we will move forward bravely, regardless of success or failure.

British and American Conspiracies Against China are Numerous

Now, more than a month has passed since my statement. The war in Greater East Asia seems to be even more pressing, but our determination is strengthened by the urgency of the war. Let us think about the lessons of the First World War. After the war between Britain and the United States, not only were colonial and small countries subjected to imperialist rule, but even those countries that participated in the war and were weaker were still rejected by Britain and the United States. If the Greater East Asia War cannot be completed, Greater East Asia and its nations will be doomed, and China will also be doomed.

Moreover, since Britain and the United States used southwestern China as their air force base, they have colluded with the Communist Party to hold Chongqing hostage. With the support of Britain and the United States, the Communist Party has intensified its oppression of Chongqing. We must consider that in the future, as the war progresses, China will become a battleground for British and American imperialism and the Communist Party to compete. China will not only become a colony of international imperialism again, but will also be reduced to the fate of the small countries along the Balkans and the Baltic Sea. At that time, there will be no Republic of China, and even the Chongqing regime will be meaningless. China will indeed be doomed, and all the nations of Greater East Asia will also be doomed.

March Forward Bravely to Seize Victory

In order to defend the liberation of the Greater East Asian nations, to defend China's acquired independence and freedom, to defend the survival of the people of the Republic of China, and to defend the implementation of the Three Principles of the People, we must only move forward bravely in the future, working with all East Asian nations to strive for the final victory. The situation in Europe has changed due to Germany's efforts. The future of the Greater East Asia War is even more optimistic. All nations on the front line are striving to fight based on defending their acquired liberation and freedom. We sincerely hope that the people and comrades in Chongqing will understand the lessons of the First World War, be vigilant against the current oppression, and be even more cautious about the future division by British and American imperialism and the Communist Party. China must rise up together to seek China's true independence and freedom. We are working hard to move forward in coordination with the new awareness and new actions of our compatriots and comrades throughout the country to complete the peaceful unification of the country.

Since China's participation in the war, in the past two years of total war, our compatriots have contributed considerable material and human resources to the Greater East Asia War. While being courageous and diligent, they have also been hardworking and resilient. In the future, they should make even more striving efforts in response to the urgency of the situation. The National Government has great respect for the efforts of the people. Today, on this commemorative day, we should express our heartfelt gratitude. The survival of the country does not depend on fate but on our own efforts. Dear comrades, compatriots, let us rise up together to complete China's independence and freedom!

### Japanese Air Force Fiercely Attacks Enemy Warships; Battle Results in Philippine Waters Expanding

Philippine Base, 9th (Central News Agency) – Since enemy warships invaded the Sulu Sea, the Japanese Air Force in the Philippines has resolutely launched a fierce offensive and defensive battle to crush the enemy's ambition to invade Luzon Island.

Japanese planes formed a special attack team and launched a brave and unparalleled ramming attack. The battle results are expanding. However, enemy planes approached the Lingayen area, and since the morning of the 8th, the enemy fleet seems to have gradually retreated to the western sea. The Japanese army's fierce attack continued until the evening of the 8th. Enemy warships on fire can be seen everywhere in the sea west of Manila. The offensive battle to bravely kill the enemy has reached its climax.

The Japanese army used fierce anti-aircraft fire to shoot down nine of them (four of which appeared to have been shot down). The remaining planes were repelled. Detailed battle results are currently under investigation.

### Dozens of B-29s Attacked Tokyo Yesterday; Enemy Planes Failed to Attack Horonobu Island

Tokyo, 9th (Central News Agency) – About dozens of enemy B-29 planes from the Mariana Islands invaded the Kanto and central regions of Japan from 2:00 PM on the 9th. Most of them dropped bombs and incendiary bombs in the Tokyo area, but Japanese losses were extremely minimal. The enemy planes, under the fierce interception of the Japanese air defense forces, fled south at around 3:00 PM. The results of the interception are currently under investigation, but enemy planes catching fire and falling out of formation over Tokyo were witnessed by all.

Tokyo, 8th (Central News Agency) – About seven enemy warships bombarded a portion of the Horonobu Island on the afternoon of the 6th at 3:00 PM, but they were repelled by the Japanese defenders. On the 7th, two enemy B-24 planes invaded the area and carried out blind bombing, but they were wounded and fled due to the interception of the Japanese air control forces. The Japanese side suffered no losses.

### Japanese National Movement Actively Unfolds

Tokyo, 9th (Central News Agency) – The powerful national movement, that is, the issue of national reorganization, is currently a major topic in Japanese political circles, and this topic is gradually surfacing. Japan's current war situation has reached its most difficult stage. At this critical moment for the nation's survival, every citizen is willing to fight to the end, hence the launch of the national movement. The momentum of this national reorganization movement is different from the past. In the past, it was mostly promoted by the government, but now it is purely voluntary from civilian political and other groups. However, regarding how to realize the political strengthening that the people are looking forward to, there are differences of opinion. However, in terms of surface activities, there are three organizations: the Assistance Association, the Assistance Administration, and the Assistance Youth. The intentions of these three organizations are roughly as follows: The Assistance Association is a public affairs organization and the main body of national organization, so there is no purely unified opinion. From a broader perspective, the Assistance Administration and the Assistance Youth seem to be inclined to cooperate with each other. Therefore, the Assistance Administration, which currently has no local branches, seems to want to organize the Assistance Youth, an organization headed by Mr. Takekawa, as its new local branches. However, given the current political situation, it is difficult to implement the original policy. Therefore, the heads of the Bridge Department first resigned, and Mr. Ogata, Vice President of the Assistance Association, concurrently served as the head of the Assistance Youth, but this is a temporary measure. As for the cadres of the Tokyo Assistance Youth, they do not want their leaders to be figures from old parties and political factions. However, to solve this problem, there must be someone who can connect the Assistance Youth and Assistance Administration and make them a cooperative system. Therefore, it will take some time to find such a person. The Assistance Administration's theory of dissolving the Assistance Youth seems to have failed. Therefore, in the future, the Assistance Youth will focus on its own youth and middle-aged core movement and develop forward. The activities in this Japanese national movement are quite capable of enhancing the cooperative relationship between the Assistance Administration, the Assistance Association, and the Assistance Youth, which is quite promising.

### Total Mobilization of Intellectuals in Chongqing Difficult to Achieve

Guangzhou, 9th (Central News Agency) – According to information arriving locally, the movement to encourage educated youth to join the army in Chongqing has been slow to progress.

The Chongqing authorities plan to recruit students who have fled from Guilin to make up the numbers, but this is still difficult to achieve.

Editorial

### Revitalizing the Integrity Movement

Officials are the political leaders who govern the country and lead the masses. If most officials cannot fulfill their duties, they are not sufficient to govern the country, nor can they lead the masses. Naturally, they cannot "manage their families, govern the country, and bring peace to the world." Therefore, in order to make politics move towards the right track, the integrity movement must be given importance.

However, the reasons for the decline in officialdom's discipline and the low efficiency of administration must have various political and economic roots. Therefore, the promotion of the integrity movement cannot be expected to achieve results by relying solely on a slogan or appealing to moral and ethical concepts. Instead, it must strictly establish various appropriate measures economically and politically, so that those in politics can fulfill their duties, dare not be corrupt, and have no way to be corrupt. Only then can an honest political atmosphere be established. Here, we will try to offer a few principles to serve as the foundation for promoting and achieving the integrity movement.

First, the lives of civil servants should be stabilized. Guanzi said, "Only when clothing and food are sufficient will people know honor and disgrace." As the saying goes, an empty stomach cannot serve the public. Therefore, stabilizing the lives of civil servants is the primary prerequisite for realizing integrity and improving work efficiency. If most civil servants, from high-ranking officials to patrolmen, cannot support their families with their salaries, or even cannot fill their own stomachs, then politics will never be clear and national affairs will never be improved. Perhaps some will say that the current annual expenditures are huge and finances are difficult, and raising the salaries of civil servants is known to be important, but the resources are insufficient. This statement is seemingly correct but actually wrong. We dare to assert that if politics can truly achieve a degree of eliminating corruption and malpractice, then the interception of various tax revenues will be eliminated, and the annual income will definitely have a huge and amazing increase. How could the mere increase in the salaries of civil servants still be a problem? This is the first point. Second, the integrity movement must strengthen the management of political affairs and personnel. Currently, the management of administrative and personnel affairs in many administrative and public service agencies is really too lax and unreasonable, so that many lower-level personnel can do whatever they want, and even collude with their superiors, exploiting the public interest for private gain, treating public service as a child's play, and treating ordinary people like grass. This is the most unacceptable thing and urgently needs to be improved. Third, after life is guaranteed and the management of political affairs and personnel is on track, politics must also demand a heavy emphasis on law and discipline, and strict rewards and punishments, so that civil servants obey the law and dare not test the law, and then the establishment of honest discipline can be hoped for. Fourth, the establishment of integrity discipline requires even more the "setting an example" of those in positions of authority, and then those below can follow suit. Otherwise, "if the upper beam is not straight, the lower beams will be crooked," and the entire discipline will never be revitalized. Finally, the implementation of wartime living, strictly prohibiting the atmosphere of luxury and decadence, limiting extravagance and food, reducing waste, and eliminating the motives for corruption are also indispensable plans in the process of promoting the integrity movement. Today's rampant corruption is, in fact, largely due to the temptations of the environment. Extravagance and waste not only directly consume materials but also cultivate a decadent atmosphere, which is not appropriate during wartime. Therefore, it must be eradicated. If we can do this, the establishment of honest politics will be easier. May all parties strive for it.

### Japanese Troops on the Burmese Front Carry Out Daring Surprise Attacks; Suicide Squads Penetrate Enemy Lines Everywhere

Burmese Frontline Base, 9th (Central News Agency) – The Isokawa Special Suicide Squad of the Japanese Army on the Burmese Front penetrated deep into enemy lines in the fiercely fought frontline, shocking the enemy and continuing to carry out daring surprise attacks, reaping great battle results. At the beginning of December, the suicide squad sneaked into enemy positions near Kaleva, carrying out daring surprise attacks, killing and wounding many enemy soldiers, and capturing one tank and many other weapons. Another Japanese army suicide squad, since December 28th, carried out a surprise attack on an enemy artillery position five kilometers north of Kambaal, destroying five temple tents and three large trucks, and killing or wounding 15 enemy soldiers before returning.

### Hong Kong Governor's Office Prohibits the Use of Hostile Currency

Hong Kong, 9th (Central News Agency) – The Japanese Governor's Office in Hong Kong previously issued a notice prohibiting the use of hostile currencies such as Hong Kong dollars and old legal tender. However, recently, in view of the fact that such hostile currencies are actually being traded on the black market, which has had a significant impact on prices, it has now widely prohibited the possession of hostile currencies again in order to eliminate malpractices. On the 8th, a clear order was issued regarding the revised regulations on currency rules within the above-mentioned jurisdiction, which began to be implemented on the same day. In order to sympathize with the general public who hold such hostile currencies, the Governor's Office has decided to implement a special exchange of hostile currencies at various banks for about one month starting from January 8th.

### Expanding the New Movement and Completing the War: Director-General Lin Broadcasts Encouragement to the Nation

Nanjing, Ninth (Central News Agency dispatch): Lin Baisheng, Director-General of the China Youth Corps, in commemoration of the second anniversary of China's participation in the war, delivered a broadcast titled "Expanding the New Movement and Completing the War." He encouraged the people to follow the late Leader's teachings on the New Life Movement, shouldering the mission of resisting American and British aggression in Asia. The original text is as follows: Today, January 9th, marks the second anniversary of our country's participation in the war. I remember that on January 9th last year, the Leader, despite being ill, presided over the anniversary ceremony and earnestly instructed the nation to strive to increase production, rectify thought, and ensure public safety. Today, as we commemorate the second anniversary of our participation in the war, although the Leader has passed away, his spirit continues to guide us, his surviving comrades. The people of the whole country, amidst their grief, feel an even greater sense of responsibility. We must dedicate all our strength to the country, to East Asia, to revitalize the country, to consolidate East Asia, only then can we be worthy of the Leader's spirit in heaven.

Fighting to the End for Freedom

Three years have passed since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, and two years since our country joined the war. This war is the unity of hundreds of millions of people in East Asia to settle accounts with Anglo-American aggression. It is a war to demand freedom and liberation after a century of oppression and bullying by our enemies, the Anglo-American imperialists. We want to survive, we want to restore East Asia to the people of East Asia, we want to strive for national independence and freedom, so we want war, we want war to the end. Since the beginning of the war, thanks to the Allied forces bravely defeating the enemy on the front lines, a firm foundation for victory has been laid. Up to today, the war has passed its third year, and the war has become increasingly fierce, reaching a decisive stage.

The Enemy's Illusions Completely Shattered

After the enemy landed on Guadalcanal, fantasies of victory surrounded the enemy, thinking that the main force of the Japanese navy had been defeated, and landing on the coast of China and even reaching the Japanese mainland would be as easy as turning their hand. However, after the Battle of Taiwan, followed by the Battle of the Philippine Sea, the facts of the war shattered the enemy's illusions. The estimations of the enemy's General Staff's operational plan had to be automatically corrected. This is just the first blow, the first correction. Subsequent blows and subsequent corrections will occur two or three times until the enemy is forced to abandon their dream of re-aggression. Compatriots, we must strengthen our belief in victory. The results of the war in recent years have proven that the belief in victory is not an illusion, not empty talk, but based on 100% factual evidence. (To be continued)

### Commemorating the Second Anniversary of Participation in the War: Mass Rally Held, Heads of Various Agencies Attended and Delivered Speeches

Yesterday (the 9th) was the second anniversary of our country's participation in the war. Considering the great significance of our country's participation in the war, and to express the belief of all the people of the city in the inevitable victory of the Greater East Asia War, under the auspices of the Municipal Propaganda Office, the "Shanghai Citizens' Victory Celebration Rally Commemorating the Second Anniversary of China's Participation in the War" was held yesterday morning at the Daguangming Theater on Jing'an Temple Road. Attending were the heads of various agencies, Municipal Government Secretary-General Wu, Chief of Staff Xiong of the Security Command, President Jiang of the Central Naval Academy, Director Liu of the Municipal Party Department, Director Dai of the Education Bureau, Director Gu of the Baojia Office, Director Liang of the Propaganda Office, Matsudaira, Head of the Shanghai Office of the Allied Embassy, Chairman Yuan of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, and more than two thousand representatives from various agencies, public organizations, military police, Baojia, and youth groups.

Yuan Ludeng's Speech: At 10:00 a.m., the meeting began with music. After Yuan Ludeng, representing the presidium, led the attendees in observing the rituals, he read the National Government's Proclamation of War and delivered the opening speech, saying in brief: "Today is the second anniversary of our country's participation in the war. Shanghai citizens from all walks of life are holding this victory celebration rally here, and I am very excited by your enthusiastic participation. The Greater East Asia War is a war for the liberation of all East Asian nations. Our country's participation in the war is the foundation for the inevitable victory of the Greater East Asia War. Our country's participation in this war is for the independence of the country, for the co-prosperity of East Asia, and even more for the happiness of our descendants. Therefore, we should concentrate the strength and spirit of each individual and contribute to the completion of the war and the completion of liberation. For two years, the glorious achievements of the Allied forces on the front lines have strengthened our belief in inevitable victory. We are now at the decisive stage, and we, the citizens of Shanghai, can only fulfill the responsibilities of the rear area, redouble our efforts, and pray for the early arrival of the bright future. I offer these thoughts as my opening speech today and wish the front lines victory."

Xiong Jiandong's Speech: Next, Chief of Staff Xiong of the Security Command delivered a speech on behalf of the command, saying in brief: "On this second anniversary of our participation in the war, we should express our respect for the spirit of the Allied forces fighting bravely on the front lines. In order to strive for freedom and resist the shackles of the American and British enemies, we should continue the late Chairman Wang's legacy under the leadership of Acting Chairman Chen, share life and death with the Allies, put all our spirit into the first line of the decisive battle, actively seek national peace and unity, and contribute all our strength to defending East Asia and liberating East Asia, in order to achieve victory as soon as possible."

Jiang Xiyuan's Speech: Next, President Jiang Xiyuan of the Central Naval Academy delivered a speech, saying in brief: "This year is the decisive year of the Greater East Asia War. We should seize this opportunity for inevitable victory and strive for vigorous development. On the front lines of the Greater East Asia War are the Allied naval, land, and air forces, fighting a great battle of blood and fire with the American enemy with a spirit of loyalty and courage. But the people of Greater East Asia in the rear should also cooperate with the soldiers on the front lines with this spirit to seize this last five-minute opportunity and overcome the difficulties together."

Matsudaira's Speech: Next, Matsudaira, Head of the Shanghai Office of the Japanese Embassy, delivered a speech in Chinese, saying in brief: "Today is the second anniversary of China's participation in the war, and I am participating in this grand meeting with a very excited mood. Since the launch of the Greater East Asia War, the Chinese National Government has repeatedly issued statements, vowing to share weal and woe and life and death with Japan. The Japanese people have a deeper understanding of China, and the relationship between China and Japan has therefore become closer. After the signing of the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty, Japan returned all concessions in order to enable China to complete its sovereign independence and territorial integrity. However, China's demand for true sovereign independence and territorial integrity depends on the victory of the Greater East Asia War. The battle with the American enemy is becoming more and more fierce every day, and Britain not only refuses to recognize the independence of Burma and India, but also attacks them. From this, we can know that the Anglo-Americans have the ambition to occupy all countries in East Asia as their own and attempt to turn all countries in East Asia into Anglo-American slaves. Therefore, we must unite all the nations of Greater East Asia to jointly destroy the Anglo-Americans. Now, Japan is using the Philippine Islands as a base and organizing special attack teams with brave young people, using their own bodies as bombs to destroy enemy ships and enemy aircraft. This spirit, I think, is enough to inspire the Chinese people to rise up together. As long as we adhere to our purpose and strive to fight, the victory of the Greater East Asia War will certainly be achieved. I hope everyone will redouble their efforts for the country and for East Asia." After the speech, everyone stood up to read a congratulatory telegram to Acting Chairman Chen and Prime Minister Koiso of the Allied Nations. Finally, they shouted slogans and dispersed.

### Shanghai Branch of the Press Association Holds a Lecture Meeting

The Shanghai branch of the Chinese Press Association held a lecture meeting commemorating participation in the war yesterday (the 9th) afternoon at 5:00 p.m. at the Daguangming Theater on Jing'an Temple Road. Chen Binhe, Chairman of the Association, Executive Directors Osaka and Shinichi, Chen Riping, Xu Liqu, Jin Xiongbai, Chu Baojie, Yuan Shu, and Moriyama Kyo attended the meeting. Guests included Hidaka Seima, Editor-in-Chief of the New Shenbao. Chen Binhe presided over the meeting, and Secretary-General Lu Feng reported the significance of the meeting. Chen Riping, Deputy Director of Xinwen Daily, then delivered a speech. His words were sharp and aroused the emotions of the audience, lasting for about half an hour. After the speech, the film "Hero and Beauty" began to be screened, ending at 8:00 p.m. Chen Riping's speech is recorded below.

Chen Riping's Speech: Today is the second anniversary of our country's participation in the Greater East Asia War. I have some thoughts and hopes that I would like to discuss with everyone. First, the Greater East Asia War must be completed. Looking back at the period when Anglo-American forces expanded in East Asia, they used their aggressive principles in politics and economics. In particular, our country has been devastated and humiliated for more than 100 years since the Opium War with Britain, and the opium poison has not been eradicated in our country. It is truly heartbreaking to speak of it. Also, the United States restricts the entry of overseas Chinese, discriminates against races, and openly treats them unequally. I ask, can people with even a little bit of backbone endure this kind of treatment of us? Furthermore, they use concessions as a basis to exploit our people and use extraterritoriality as a shield to erode our rights and interests, despise the national system, and insult the nation. The shame of the family and the country is greater than this. Moreover, the greater the pressure, the stronger the reaction. The pressure we have received is indeed great and heavy, so in order to seek national survival and national revival, the government resolutely participated in the war, and the people unanimously supported it. This kind of power is stronger than any power. No matter how much pressure others put on us, as long as we persevere to the end, with hundreds of millions of people united, I dare say that our goal can definitely be achieved and our mission can definitely be completed. Therefore, the Greater East Asia War must be completed. We must examine and cooperate with each other. Under the wartime system, we must pay attention to two things: stabilizing people's livelihoods and strengthening our strength. Chairman Wang gave clear instructions at the one-week anniversary last year, the main points of which are: (1) rectify thought, (2) ensure public safety, and (3) increase production. Over the years, the government authorities have made efforts, but it cannot be said that they have been completely satisfactory. At the same time, the people have not been able to eliminate profiteering and hedonism, which has had a considerable impact on the overall situation. We must understand that the country should be based on the people, and the people should put the country first. We must think of the greater good and not seek self-interest, especially at this final juncture and decisive stage. The government and the people, the people and the government, must unite and be consistent with the outside world in order to achieve national prosperity and peace. Therefore, everyone must painfully restrain themselves, and all behaviors that hinder the national economy and people's livelihood must be eradicated. All levels must cooperate and jointly shoulder the obligations that participating in the war requires of its citizens.

We recognize the great significance of participating in the war, and at the same time strengthen our confidence that we must complete it. If we work together with one heart and one mind and fight bravely, then the final victory will surely belong to us. This is an undoubtedly certain result and also the point we must reach.

### Yesterday Was the Thirteenth Air Defense Day: Various Trainings Were Implemented, the Entire Day in a State of Air Defense

Yesterday (the 9th) was the thirteenth Air Defense Day, coinciding with the first anniversary of the establishment of "Air Defense Day." The Municipal Air Defense Headquarters, in addition to expanding the propaganda of the true meaning of air defense, also implemented various major air defense trainings. The details are recorded as follows:

Alarm Training: From early morning, the entire day was in a state of air defense. Although alarm sirens were not sounded during this alarm training, citizens were able to implement various measures in accordance with the prescribed time under the command of police and security personnel. At 8:00 a.m., a training alert was issued, followed by an air raid alarm at 9:30 a.m., an air raid alarm cancellation at 10:30 a.m., and an alert cancellation at 11:30 a.m. In the afternoon, a training alert was issued at 2:00 p.m., an air raid alarm at 3:00 p.m., an air raid alarm cancellation at 4:00 p.m., and an alert cancellation at 5:00 p.m. In the evening, a training air raid alarm was issued at 7:00 p.m., followed by an air raid alarm cancellation at 7:30 p.m., and a full alert cancellation at 8:00 p.m. During the various training alarms, traffic control and lighting control were implemented. The management of air defense lights has also improved. During the training air raid alarms, all entertainment venues were closed, and the audience was guided to the designated shelters. The situation was good.

Communication Training: The Air Defense Authority, in order to guard against any unfortunate event that may disrupt all communication channels, must quickly carry out communication work. Therefore, communication training was implemented from 12:00 p.m. to 3:00 p.m. yesterday. At that time, an alarm was received from the Army and Navy Air Defense Day Headquarters, and communication was immediately implemented to the various branch offices and relevant agencies and organizations. Each branch office had a police and defense section responsible for receiving the report and immediately ordering the liaison officers stationed at each Lianbao to return to their respective Lianbao to communicate the message, and then the communication officers of each Lianbao notified each Bao, and the communication officers of each Bao communicated the message within each Bao by ringing a bell. At the same time, ten liaison officers from each district were under the command of the Air Defense Section Chief at the Air Defense Headquarters, quickly communicating the message. Thoroughness and accuracy must be ensured. On the one hand, the Baojia authorities of each district, after receiving the alarm communication, immediately hung blue and red signal triangular flags at designated traffic intersections and prominent locations based on the issued alert and air raid alarm orders so that the public could be fully aware of the situation and take all necessary measures. The results were satisfactory.

Local Training: At the same time, the Air Defense Authority thoroughly improved air defense measures and, starting from this Air Defense Day, implemented local general staff training in the areas under the jurisdiction of each branch office, starting with Huangpu District. Training was first implemented north of Fuzhou Road in the district from 2:00 p.m. and south of Fuzhou Road from 3:00 p.m. Police and security personnel from each district came to the scene to observe. The training was conducted under the command of Kobayashi Minemiro, the head of the branch office, and Liu Yaying, the deputy head of the branch office. The Air Defense Headquarters and military and police authorities sent personnel to inspect the training. The entire area was divided into twenty-one locations, and the detonation of firecrackers was simultaneously trained to simulate the blind bombing of a large squadron of enemy aircraft. Each location had emergency situations of being bombed and hit by bullets. Police and security personnel and nearby residents participated in drills such as extinguishing fires, rescuing, and providing first aid. At the same time, upon hearing the sound of firecrackers, nearby residents conducted evacuation training, and the atmosphere was very tense. The simulation was very realistic. The training ended at 4:00 p.m. This local training will be implemented in different districts in the future.

Comprehensive Training: Each district specified different areas to implement comprehensive training in rescue, fire fighting, and evacuation. Huangpu had two locations, Laozha had five sessions from 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., Xincheng had four locations, Jing'an Temple had four locations, Jiangning Road had two locations, Putuo Road had four locations, Hongkou had two locations, West Hongkou had two locations, North Sichuan Road had five locations, Tilanqiao had five locations, Yulin Road had three locations, Yangshupu had two locations, Xinshijie had two locations, Taishan had a total of sixteen locations, Lujiabang had four locations, Changshu Road had two locations, Huashan had two locations, Changning had three locations, Yimiao had two locations, Penglai Road had one location, Xieqiao had four locations, Xujiahui had seven locations, Zhabei had three locations, and Dongchang Road had two locations.

Baojia personnel and residents participated in the training, and the police, security personnel, and civilians jointly implemented air defense work. At the same time, the specially established defense groups of various factories and buildings held air defense exercises separately, and the authorities sent personnel to guide them, and all air defense equipment was thoroughly inspected.

In addition, the Nanmatou street area of the city held various air defense exercises at 10:00 a.m., and in the afternoon, the Dongchang Road Police Branch supervised fire protection, rescue, and evacuation work in its Changzhan street area.

### Vagrant Labor Camp Begins Reception Work: Starting with Ruffians at Docks and Stations

In order to educate vagrants and beggars, reform hooligans and gangsters, and force them to work, thereby increasing production and cooperating with public security, the Ministry of Social Welfare and the Shanghai Municipal Government have jointly established the Shanghai Vagrant Labor Camp. Since preparations began in April last year, it has been fully completed. The first reception center is now located at No. 267 Penglai Road, Nanshi, specializing in organizing work such as registration, investigation, and medical treatment for vagrants entering the camp. A special reception center has also been established in Caohejing, specializing in receiving vagrants with bad character who need strict education and management in order to improve their character and participate in labor. In addition, the camp has also been allocated the former training camp and model prison site in Huacao Town by the Municipal Government as the first and second farms for vagrants to cultivate. It is scheduled to start reception this month, but due to limited funding and small scale, it is currently unable to universally accommodate all vagrants in the city. After deliberation by the board of directors, it was decided to start with the hooligans and gangsters who extort passengers and harm the people most at the city's docks and stations, in order to reduce the suffering of travelers. The camp has sent a letter to the Municipal Police Bureau for assistance.
