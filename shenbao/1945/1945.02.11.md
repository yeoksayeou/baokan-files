### The Enemy's Ingenious Enticement Strategy Leads to a Predicament in Luzon: Street Fighting in Manila Causes Heavy Enemy Casualties

Central News Agency, Philippine Front, 10th: Although enemy forces have advanced to Manila, the decisive battle for Luzon has not yet concluded. On the contrary, it can be said that the real decisive battle is just beginning. Due to the Japanese army's clever enticement strategy, the enemy has committed a large force of the 8th Division to Lingayen, leaving them no time to build a bridgehead. Half of their forces are moving south across the Luzon Plain. At the same time, three divisions were landed north of Subic Bay and Nasugbu, and a brigade of airborne troops was mobilized to swiftly capture Manila. The still-intact Japanese strongholds continue to inflict heavy casualties on the enemy. Furthermore, along the slender 250-kilometer stretch of Luzon Island from Lingayen Bay to Manila, the enemy forces are constantly threatened by the Japanese army from the front and flanks. It is reported that General Yamashita, at the combat headquarters of a certain forward base, smiled and said that the enemy had entered "my belly," and the overall situation was completely under General Yamashita's mysterious tactical maneuvering. Therefore, the enemy's leadership will feel even greater distress after reaching Manila.

Central News Agency, Manila, 10th: The fighting in Manila remains fierce, with the current focus of the battle being in the Pasig River area, which is engulfed in artillery fire. On the 7th, a portion of the enemy forces, using amphibious tanks and small boats, crossed the Pasig River near the Malacañang Palace. The Japanese army immediately launched a fierce attack. The street fighting in Manila has intensified on both the north and south banks of the river, with the Japanese inflicting heavy casualties on the enemy. In this battle, the enemy used flamethrowers to attack Japanese fortifications and also set fires indiscriminately throughout the city, gradually turning Manila into scorched earth. Since the 7th, the enemy has been attempting to launch a formal attack on Manila, now being reduced to ashes, ordering one or two divisions from Subic Bay in the west and Clark in the north to rush towards Manila. At the same time, the 1st Cavalry Division, which has already entered Manila, is awaiting reinforcements to launch a joint attack on the south bank. A portion of the enemy troops moving south from Clark and Cabanatuan are attempting to cut off the Japanese fortifications east of Manila and link up with enemy forces in Manila, aiming to connect with the forces attacking from the south. The enemy's current strategy is to encircle Manila from the east, west, and south. The enemy also plans to completely occupy Manila once they enter Manila Bay, and has therefore been heavily bombarding Corregidor Island for days, while also gathering ships at Olongapo in Manila Bay. Surrounded by this heavy pressure, the Japanese army continues to defend the city with a small force, using ingenious tactics to inflict heavy casualties on the enemy. Furthermore, the Japanese forces in the eastern fortifications and south of Manila are continuing to bravely engage the enemy to break through their encirclement, so the future battles will become extremely fierce.

Enemy US Army Organization and Equipment

Central News Agency, Tokyo, 9th: According to a January 23rd announcement by the MacArthur Headquarters regarding the organization of the US forces operating in the Lingayen Bay area, the troops attacking Luzon are under the command of General Krueger of the Sixth US Army, under General MacArthur, consisting of five divisions and one regiment, and the enemy's supply in Lingayen Bay is quite abundant. It is estimated that the enemy's forces in Luzon now number more than ten divisions, including approximately three armored divisions. The organization of the enemy's US Army is based on armored divisions as the core of the entire army, with infantry divisions, motorized divisions, cavalry divisions, airborne divisions, and naval landing divisions all organized according to the requirements of the operation. The composition of each unit, for example, in an infantry division, the armored component accounts for about one-third, and other guerrilla forces are also appropriately allocated to the army. The equipment of their forces is entirely based on quantity as an element of attack. Typically, an armored division has about 600 officers, 13,000 non-commissioned officers and soldiers, about 10,000 pistols, a total of 2,750 automatic rifles, light and heavy machine guns, eight mortars, and 54 tank guns. In addition, there are more than 50 self-propelled 75mm guns, 208 medium tanks with 75mm guns, 146 light tanks with 37mm guns, and 154 armored vehicles and 690 half-track vehicles. This is the standard strength of an enemy armored division. As for an infantry division, there are also 600 officers, 15,000 non-commissioned officers and soldiers, 10,600 rifles, 4,100 pistols, a total of 679 automatic rifles, light and heavy machine guns, 107 mortars, 32 tank guns, and 48 howitzers. Personnel, weapons, ammunition, accessories, and equipment are transported by 1,800 vehicles. However, it is too early to assume that the enemy forces in Luzon are organized according to the above-mentioned situation. Observing the enemy's one division force on Leyte Island, it is as low as about 12,000 men, and there are 150 tanks in an armored division. However, because the enemy relies on firepower for both attack and defense, they feel very fearful in a bayonet fight. The suicide attack squads launched by the Japanese army in Luzon in recent days are indeed a sure-kill tactic to attack the enemy's weaknesses.

### The Japanese Army in Northern Kanto Intercepts Enemy Aircraft

Central News Agency, Tokyo, 10th: The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced at 5:30 PM on the 10th that approximately 90 enemy aircraft attacked northern Kanto on the afternoon of the 10th. The results of the interception are currently under investigation, and some damage has been done to Japanese ground facilities.

### Enemy Aircraft Blindly Bomb Saigon

Central News Agency, Pailin, 10th: A dozen enemy B-29 aircraft from Calcutta bombed Saigon and the city of Pailin, the capital of Pursat, on the 7th. By the evening of the 8th, it was clear that 100 people had died and 250 were injured. The pagodas of two temples in the city center collapsed, and dozens of monks were injured. The citizens of Pailin, known as a Buddhist country, were filled with indignation.

### The Japanese Army Occupies Suichuan and Ganzhou: Chongqing and the US Suffer Setbacks

Central News Agency, Pacific Front Base, 10th: With the Japanese army's recent capture of the Suichuan and Ganzhou airfield groups, gaining control of the airspace over that battle line, the enemy's US Fourteenth Air Force's assault operations have completely disintegrated. Air raids on the Japanese mainland have also been unsuccessful. The recent bad weather is one reason, but their activity in supporting the Chongqing army during the operations in Weiyang, Guilin, and Liuzhou last autumn has become more difficult since the fall of the Hengyang, Guilin, and Liuzhou bases. The Chongqing army's morale has plummeted due to the loss of the Suichuan base group, and the Chongqing army, now isolated in the southwest, is showing signs of collapse. The US Air Force authorities stationed in Chongqing are conducting the construction of inland base groups. The recent decrease in activity by the Fourteenth Air Force may be due to the focus on the construction of inland bases. There are two purposes for building inland bases: (1) to bomb major cities in the occupied areas to disrupt the morale of the rear, and (2) to prepare for a mainland landing operation. Viewed in this light, their movements are worthy of close attention.

### Relations Between Chongqing and the Communists Worsen

Central News Agency, Springsbok, 9th: The Yan'an regime has made a request to Chongqing to establish a coalition government, which Chongqing has rejected. Therefore, Yan'an is likely to establish a communist country independently. According to a report by a New York Times correspondent, "The Yan'an regime is now considering organizing a Chinese Democratic United Committee or a similar independent organization. If this plan is realized, China will be divided into three, and the internal conflicts will be difficult to resolve through peaceful means. Currently, the negotiations between Chongqing and Yan'an are becoming increasingly difficult, with no basis for reconciliation, and the two are completely opposed to each other."

### The Ministry of Industry's Forestry and Reclamation Department Adjusts and Improves Areas

Central News Agency, Nanjing, 10th: In order to ensure sufficient funding, concentrate talent, and maximize the effectiveness of various agricultural improvement areas, the Forestry and Reclamation Department of the Ministry of Industry has drafted the following adjustment plan for the improvement areas and submitted it to the Executive Yuan for review and approval. The plan involves abolishing various improvement areas, leaving only Jiangdu, Jiaxing, and Changshu counties. It is reported that the selection of personnel for the positions of directors of each area is currently underway.

### Partial Reorganization of the Japanese Cabinet: Inauguration Ceremony Held Yesterday; Kodama Appointed Minister of Education, Aikawa Minister of Health

Central News Agency, Tokyo, 10th: Regarding the partial reorganization of the cabinet, the Japanese government received imperial approval on the 10th, and the inauguration ceremony was held in the palace at 8 PM. The government authorities announced the following regarding the change of cabinet members: Minister of State Hideo Kodama was appointed Minister of Education, Vice Minister of Health Katsuroku Aikawa was appointed Minister of Health, Minister of Health Hisatada Hirose was appointed Minister of State, and Osami Ninomiya's request to resign was approved.

Furthermore, in accordance with Article 1, Paragraph 4 of the House of Peers Ordinance, Takeo Tanaka was appointed a member of the House of Peers.

### The Soviet Army's Offensive Focus Shifts to the Upper Warta River: Fierce Fighting on Both Sides of Frankfurt

Central News Agency, Berlin, 10th: The focus of the Soviet offensive on the Eastern Front has shifted to the front of Breslau, the capital of Silesia. The Soviet army is attempting to encircle the German army's strong defensive positions from the south, but has been thwarted by fierce German resistance. Now, the Soviet army is attempting to achieve this goal by heading north. In the situation in the lower Warta River war zone, the Soviet army is advancing towards Berlin from Frankfurt, and it is reported that localized attacks have begun. Although a large-scale operation may be launched, fierce fighting continues on both sides of Frankfurt. South of Frankfurt, the Soviet army has established a solid position on the west bank of the Warta River. At the same time, the battle of Kustrin continues, and although the Soviet army has deployed new infantry units to the front line, the German corridor in Kustrin cannot be cut off. The main force of the Soviet army on the Berlin front is now gradually increasing its strength in the stretch of more than 80 kilometers along the middle reaches of the Warta River, and has engaged in a tug-of-war offensive and defensive battle with the German army. Another Soviet unit on the right flank is attacking from the direction of Landsberg through Küstrin-Kietz towards Seelow. The vanguard unit is reported to have reached a point 24 kilometers from Seelow.

### Australian Troops Partially Demobilized

Central News Agency, Lisbon, 10th: Reuter's report from Canberra: The Australian Department of Defence announced that it has now decided to demobilize personnel in the army who have no important tasks.

### Berlin Citizens Determined to Resist

Central News Agency, Tokyo, 10th: According to a Berlin dispatch in the Mainichi Shimbun, the inhumane large-scale bombings by the British and American air forces have further strengthened the Berlin citizens' determination to resist. After the air raids, the high-rise buildings and residences in the city center have been completely destroyed, power lines are hanging down, and gas and telephone lines are completely cut off. The devastation of the air raids is truly indescribable. Refugees are lined up in front of drinking water and food distribution points waiting for supplies. The reconstruction units of the engineering corps continue to be active. The four million citizens continue to work hard on defense facilities. Key points in the city have been prepared, and trenches are lined up everywhere, suggesting that fierce street fighting is inevitable. There are many military trains in the city, the police force is fully armed, and people's assault teams are patrolling with guns. The citizens show no signs of wavering in the face of tension, and everyone is doing their jobs. Foreign workers are also freely moving in the streets inside the fortress. The solid determination of the citizens can be seen from this.

### New Offensives Launched on the Northern and Southern Wings of the Western Front: German Forces Retreat to the East Bank of the Rhine

Central News Agency, Berlin, 10th: Reuter's report: The offensive by the right wing of the Canadian army at the Nijmegen bridgehead, following heavy artillery fire and aircraft bombing, can be seen as the preliminary action of a major anti-Axis offensive. This offensive seems to be creating a focal point for the offensive. The large army concentrated northeast of Aachen indicates that the focus of the offensive is between the Meuse River and the Eifel region, and the British Second Army and the US Ninth Army may launch an attack at any time. The anti-Axis forces' pincer attack on the Rhineland-Westphalia industrial area seems to be beginning, with the British and American forces on the southern wing and the Canadian forces on the northern wing. The Canadian forces encountered extremely strong resistance at Gennep, and only gained a foothold in a few small towns. The US Third Army is now the main force in the Eifel region, indicating that a large part of the US First Army has moved north, intending to break through the northern German plain.

Central News Agency, Berlin, 10th: DNB report: Yesterday, strong French infantry units and tank columns attacked continuously day and night in the upper Rhine River, attempting to disrupt the German army's withdrawal movement in that area. The German rearguard fought fiercely with the enemy, allowing most of the German army and heavy weaponry to cross the Rhine River to the east bank via the Ruhmberg bridge. After the last batches of German troops had withdrawn, the bridges were blown up, and German artillery fire forced the pursuing French forces on the west bank to take cover.

Weekly Commentary

### On the Shanghai Price Problem

— Wu Musheng

Although Shanghai is the economic center of Central China, and Shanghai's prices lead, influence, and even dominate prices in various places, Shanghai's prices themselves are the result of the interaction of various political, military, and economic factors, and are also subject to the reaction of prices in various places and relative changes. For example, in the political sphere, insecurity, rampant corruption, numerous extortions, and unreasonable control measures can all affect Shanghai's prices and cause them to soar. In the economic sphere, transportation blockages, stagnation of productivity, and the current currency policy are also sufficient to stimulate price increases. Although Shanghai is an industrial center, the various raw materials required in the industrial production process are demanded from various places. If the collection, transportation, and distribution of raw materials cannot be controlled, then the production of Shanghai's industry and the prices of its industrial products will be difficult to control. All of this illustrates that Shanghai's price problem is a multifaceted and comprehensive issue. If the authorities want to fundamentally solve it, they must simultaneously address it from political, military, and economic perspectives, and through the concerted efforts of all relevant authorities. Tackling it solely from Shanghai or focusing solely on the economic aspect is like ignoring the root and pursuing the branches, and the results will certainly be minimal.

Because the price problem encompasses multiple aspects or is comprehensive, a thorough solution to the price problem requires a comprehensive control of the activities of all sectors of the national economy. For example, if we can comprehensively control various materials from production, exchange, distribution, and even consumption, then the rationing system will certainly be soundly established, official prices will certainly dominate the market, black markets will certainly be unable to thrive, and speculation and hoarding will have no room to operate. The highly developed countries with controlled economies, such as Japan and Germany, are like this. They have already separated the relationship between prices and currency. An increase in currency cannot affect prices, and a shortage of materials will not lead to soaring prices. They have indeed achieved a state where everyone suffers and enjoys fairly. But China—including Shanghai—is not like this. China's economic control power cannot comprehensively and connect all parts of the national economy, so the rationing system, which is the backbone of the controlled economy, has never been strongly established, black market prices are rampant everywhere, speculative and hoarding activities are extremely prevalent, and the relationship between the quantity of goods and the quantity of currency to prices has not only not been decoupled, but is also very close. Under these circumstances, although the authorities subjectively try to stabilize the overall price level in various ways, such as implementing price limits, cracking down on hoarding, tightening credit, and organizing partial material rationing, past facts have shown that these attempts have generally not been successful. The crux of the problem is that they have not been able to comprehensively control the national economy.

In the era of a free economy, prices seem to be uncontrolled, but in reality, they use the "law of supply and demand" as a mechanism for adjusting or controlling prices. In countries with highly controlled economies, prices are controlled by a comprehensive rationing system, and the law of supply and demand cannot operate freely. Although the two are opposing, they each have a consistent system and operating rules. Only in present-day China, on the one hand, it has already deviated from the paradigm of a free economy, but on the other hand, the implementation of a controlled economy cannot be thorough. Therefore, the price problem under an economic system that is seemingly free but not free, and seemingly controlled but not fully controlled, is very difficult to solve.

However, high prices are ultimately a problem that harms people's livelihood and requires an urgent solution. Therefore, we will try to propose a strategy of focused control for the current high price problem within the scope that the current environment can permit.

The so-called focused control of prices means imposing extremely strict control on prices related to military and people's livelihoods, while temporarily abandoning other unimportant prices and prices that are practically impossible to fully manage. We will postpone discussing the military-related price focus for now, and first discuss the people's livelihood aspect. From the perspective of people's livelihood, the prices that Shanghai should pay attention to today seem to be the following as the most important, namely rice, firewood, coal, vegetables, and medicine prices. Now that economic depression is increasing, everyone is busy all day long for nothing more than things like oil, salt, firewood, and rice, and these things are now the most expensive. Also, when nutrition is insufficient, people are often plagued by diseases. Therefore, if the above-mentioned prices can really be suppressed, then the so-called people's livelihood problem of the average citizen of Shanghai can be said to be mostly solved.

Since it is said to be focused control, the control must be thorough. Therefore, it is also worth studying how to make the prices of the above-mentioned materials truly low. Here, we would like to point out two points: First, the economic authorities should obtain full control and management rights over the collection, transportation, and rationing of these materials. If the three rights of collection, transportation, and allocation of these materials cannot be obtained or cannot be fully exercised, then the official prices set for these materials will be difficult to maintain for a long time and in large quantities, the black market will be impossible to destroy, and the focused low-price policy will lose its meaning. That is one. Secondly, to control these important materials well, the economic control mechanism must seek to be centralized, unified, and simple. If policies come from multiple sources, and they shirk responsibility or restrain each other, then the effectiveness of the control will be difficult to achieve. As for the rectification of personnel and the eradication of corruption, these are measures that should be taken under honest governance and do not need to be discussed in depth.

In addition, there is one point that must be noted regarding the current price problem in Shanghai, that is, industrial production in Shanghai must be revived as much as possible, and the restoration of electricity supply is especially important. Part of the reason for the high prices in Shanghai is due to the rise in the cost of imported materials, but the fact that Shanghai's industrial productivity is declining day by day, resulting in a daily reduction in the supply of industrial products to Shanghai from other ports, which makes the import of materials even less smooth, is also one of the reasons for the rise in prices in Shanghai. Therefore, reviving Shanghai's productivity indirectly contributes to the stability of Shanghai's prices.

In short, rather than controlling everything and achieving nothing, it is better to concentrate efforts on a focused control of a few of the most necessary materials, the effect of which may be more far-reaching than it is now. I ask the wise men, is this so?

### Goebbels Writes That Germany Will Never Surrender, Encouraging the People to Fight Hard

Central News Agency, Berlin, 10th: Dr. Goebbels, the German Minister of Propaganda, published a statement in the February 8th issue of the national weekly, titled "The Nation Rising to Defend," expressing his determination as follows: The enemy is now taking back the most economically important areas of German territory. The era when we had surplus land to carry out operations is over. Now, the loss of one acre of land, one city, or one factory will cause a major loss to many Germans. Soviet soldiers are committing atrocities everywhere, and their extreme cruelty is beyond words. To overcome this danger, there is no other way. The German leadership can only hope that the German people will endure great pain and misery. In the two thousand years of German history, Germany has suffered many hardships, but Germany has always been victorious and maintained its dominant position in continental Europe. At present, the German people are fighting hard on the defensive, often suffering hardship, but are convinced that only the German people can overcome this danger. The danger to the world lies in the military countermeasures that are now gradually being put in place. Once the danger reaches its peak and affects all nations, it will be the time for the large number of barbarians in the northern steppes to suffer a terrible reckoning. Until then, keeping a cool head is the most important thing. Fellow countrymen, seeing this miserable reality, should rise up together. The Germans will never bow down and surrender before the war.

### Secretary-General Luo Discusses Price Issues: City Government Determined to Eliminate Artificial Causes

Yesterday morning (the 10th), Secretary-General Luo of the Municipal Government met separately with reporters from Japanese and Western newspapers in the city, elaborating in detail on the issue of commodity prices. He stated: "The issue of commodity prices is a significant fundamental problem at present. The Municipal Government is willing to enforce all economic laws and regulations related to commodity prices and is determined to first eliminate all artificial causes of the commodity price problem. Economic criminals have been reported to the central government and will be dealt with entirely by military law. Regarding institutions, the Commodity Price Evaluation Committee has recently been reorganized, and several specialized committee members have been added. These so-called 'specialized committee members' are those with extensive research on the city's commercial situation, market conditions, cost calculations, and the types and sources of materials. Speaking of commodity prices, we cannot ignore the fact that the management and crackdown on commodity prices are merely a passive method. The most important thing is to maintain a sufficient supply of materials. This will greatly facilitate the resolution of commodity price issues."

Economic Bureau to Hold Temporary Emergency Meeting Today

### Two Businesses Penalized with Suspension for Violating Price Controls

In order to suppress commodity prices and stabilize people's livelihood, the Municipal Economic Bureau strictly enforces price controls on the sale of goods by various businesses.
