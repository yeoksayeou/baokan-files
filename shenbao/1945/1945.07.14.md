### Japanese Forces Initiate Interception Battle in Two Areas of Balikpapan; Sansui Long Formation Swiftly Assaults Enemy Positions

Southwest Pacific Base, 13th (Central News Agency) - The enemy forces advancing on Balikpapan are still stubbornly attacking Japanese positions. Enemy ships continue to slowly bombard Japanese positions with artillery fire. The decisive battlefields for the two armies are currently along both banks of the river flowing through the central part of Balikpapan and in the vicinity of the oil refinery and airfield. The Japanese army is confronting the enemy's overwhelming material strength by launching a tenacious and unyielding interception battle. The enemy attacked Japanese positions near the airfield on the 9th but mistakenly triggered Japanese minefields, resulting in hundreds of casualties. The Japanese army seized the opportunity to launch a surprise attack and achieved considerable success. Recently, the enemy has avoided advancing along roads, instead gradually advancing through dense forest areas. The Japanese army has bravely intercepted them, destroying one enemy battle vehicle, disabling two, destroying two mortar positions, and eliminating fifty enemy soldiers on the 10th.

Southern Front Base, 13th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese garrison forces in Balikpapan are conducting hand-to-hand combat assaults on enemy positions in various locations, causing the enemy to fall into a state of chaos. Among them, a unit formed by Petty Officer Kokubu, Petty Officer Yamamoto, and Petty Officer Kobayashi, departed from the base on the evening of the 6th, with the cooperation of Indonesian natives, and infiltrated behind enemy artillery positions. At sunset, they swiftly assaulted the enemy positions, destroying two enemy artillery pieces with bombs, inflicting heavy casualties on enemy soldiers. Petty Officer Kobayashi, on his way back, single-handedly attacked enemy positions, destroying an enemy artillery position with a hand grenade, and gloriously sacrificing himself in the battle.

### Multiple B29 Bombers Attack Tsuruga and Other Areas; Mines Dropped in Wakasa Bay

Osaka, 13th (Central News Agency) - Approximately one hundred enemy B29 bombers, divided into three groups, attacked the Tsuruga area around 9:45 PM on the 12th. A portion dropped incendiary bombs on Tsuruga City, while the main force dropped mines in Wakasa Bay. Additionally, approximately fifty B29 bombers invaded Ogaki around 12:00 PM, dropping incendiary bombs, causing fires in the aforementioned three cities, but the fires were extinguished by 2:30 AM on the 13th, and Japanese losses were light.

Tokyo, 13th (Central News Agency) - Approximately one hundred and forty enemy B29 bombers, starting at 11:00 PM on the 12th, attacked the Kanto region in scattered formations of one or a few aircraft. One small city was attacked for about three hours, causing fires near Utsunomiya City and in a part of the Tokyo training area, which were generally extinguished by dawn on the 13th.

### Japan Strengthens Air Power

Tokyo, 13th (Central News Agency) - A naval correspondent for the "Yomiuri Shimbun" stated that after the enemy's mobile forces have been active, they have always carried out landing operations, such as Iwo Jima, Leyte, Luzon, and Okinawa. However, after the fleet carriers acted on the 10th to attack the Kanto region, there has been no new action like that of the past. The enemy is eager to obtain an airbase closer to the Japanese mainland, so it will continue to send mobile forces to attack, and we must be vigilant. The enemy's B29 bombers are attempting to eliminate Japan's will to fight and war potential, but what the enemy fears most is the reorganization and strengthening of Japan's air power. The enemy's B29 bombers hovered over the Kanto skies for only a few tens of minutes, unable to fully attack Japanese airbases, so they want to achieve their goal by repeatedly attacking with fleet carrier-based aircraft over a long period of time. However, Japan's air power, in preparation for the decisive battle on the mainland, is using the most skillful means, exists solemnly, and is being strengthened day by day.

### Japanese Students Manufacture Aircraft; Already Deployed to the Front Lines

Chiba, 13th (Central News Agency) - It is said that a aircraft factory, entirely established by students, has appeared in a corner of Chiba City.

The staff of the school factory are students mobilized throughout the year in the ×× factory, totaling ××× people, all of whom are students and graduates of the school.

### Japanese Army Secures Strategic Points in Southern Burma; Part of Forces Crosses the Hsedaw River and Fiercely Attacks

Burma Front Base, 13th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese powerful forces defending the dangerous Pegu Yoma mountains are now guarding the strategic mountain ranges of southern Burma, preventing enemy forces from invading and securing strategic points. They are also carrying out raids on the only supply routes of the enemy forces, the Yangon-Mandalay Highway and the Yangon-Kyangin Highway, to disrupt the enemy's lines. Therefore, the enemy forces, to avoid danger, dare not move at night and only transport in large groups of hundreds of heavily loaded vehicles during the day. At the same time, to ensure the safety of the transport, they constantly use aircraft, tanks, and armored vehicles to guard them closely, and deploy tank units and armored vehicles at key points to ensure complete safety of the transport. In addition, the Japanese front-line units are active among the enemy forces and have completely contained the enemy's invasion operations. As a result, the battle line has temporarily become stalemated. In addition, the Japanese forces defending the solid positions on the bends of the Hsedaw River are also preventing the enemy forces in order to support the Japanese forces in the Pegu Yoma mountain area. They also overcame the heavy rains that had just subsided at the beginning of the month, crossed the Hsedaw River, launched an offensive, destroyed the stubbornly resisting enemy forces, and captured key enemy points 50 kilometers southwest of Kyangin, near Pegu, and 5 kilometers northwest of it. They are now fiercely attacking the remaining enemy forces. This Japanese counterattack operation represents the determination to defend Burma and is also a new threatening operation. The elite Japanese units based on the steep Shan Highlands are also preventing the enemy's advance. The enemy reports on the battle situation on this side, saying: "The battle line has been in a stalemate since a month ago, and now the battle situation is favorable to the Japanese." They try to avoid mentioning their hard fighting and the difficulty in using enemy mobile units.

### Rumor of Soviet-Chinese Treaty Signed

### Agricultural Loan Branches Established in Various Counties of Jiangsu Province; Japanese Reporters Visit Su-Xi for Investigation

Suzhou, 13th (Central News Agency) - Since the Jiangsu Provincial Agricultural Loan Association began operating, it has planned to promote various agricultural loan activities.

### Britain and America Seek to Maintain a Balance of Power with the Soviet Union; Outlook for the Three-Headed Summit is Bleak

Tokyo, 13th (Central News Agency) - It is rumored that the tripartite summit of Britain, America, and the Soviet Union will be held around the 15th at the Potsdam Palace near Berlin. The purpose of this summit is to resolve the disputes between countries arising from the partition of Germany. The results of this summit will have a very close relationship with the peace of Europe and the impact of the war in East Asia. This summit is different from past summits because the protagonists have changed. The American side was formerly Roosevelt, but now it is Truman, and whether Churchill can continue to serve as British Prime Minister is a major question. It is planned that Churchill intends to attend with Labour leader Attlee, sharing responsibilities, but even observing the previous examples of Soviet diplomacy, if the other party makes a slight mistake in making concessions, the Soviet Union will rush in, and all compromises will not be easy to promote satisfactorily. It is also universally acknowledged that Truman's skills are inferior to those of Roosevelt, and it is even more doubtful whether his recent actions have been able to gain the trust of the Soviet Union. Roosevelt was able to exert the power of the domestic parliament, but Truman clearly lacks that ability. At the same time, on the British side, the Conservative Executive Committee is reportedly in dispute in order to seek Attlee to share responsibility. Now, how can the United States and Britain send such incompetent and unauthorized representatives to give the Soviet Union trust? Looking back at the first Tehran Conference, the central issue at that time was the second front, and the post-war issue was secondary. The second Yalta Conference focused on international institutions, with operational issues attached. At this time, the American and British sides are promoting the Potsdam Conference, claiming that it is, in fact, a peace conference for Europe, because the Soviet Union still has the Black Sea and Turkish Mediterranean aspects that are problematic in the talks, and will take the usual diplomatic offensive approach of taking the initiative. Recalling the fact that after the First World War, the major powers' isolation of the Soviet Union was initiated from that aspect, this kind of Soviet approach is also a natural trend. Moreover, Italy's request for peace and treaties has been long-standing, and the border disputes of small countries in the Balkans such as Greece and Bulgaria have also become pressing issues to be resolved. It is rumored that the United States and Britain may use this meeting as a meeting to resolve the Mediterranean county case in reality, but the central issue of the meeting is to deal with the German problem and the problem of the three Baltic countries, and other undecided border issues are naturally included. In summary, the purpose of the United States and Britain in this conference and the future peace conference is how to prevent the westward expansion of Soviet power and maintain the balance of power between the three countries in Europe. However, the issue of the balance of power between the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union is not limited to the European region. Speaking of this point, the East Asian issue is especially indispensable, because the Soviet Union expresses deep concern for the East Asian issue. Regarding the Chongqing government and the Yan'an issue, Soviet domestic public opinion is commenting endlessly, which shows the Soviet Union's attitude towards other issues and other regions, still temporarily keeping its secret strategy.

### Chifley Appointed Australian Prime Minister

Lisbon, 13th (Central News Agency) - According to a Canberra report: Australian Treasurer Chifley has now been formally appointed Prime Minister to succeed Curtin.

### Former Italian Prime Minister Nitti Returns Home

Lisbon, 13th (Central News Agency) - According to Swiss radio broadcasts: Nitti, who served as Prime Minister and Interior Minister from 1919 to 1929, has arrived in Milan en route to Rome. Nitti fled the country during Mussolini's fascist regime and has always opposed fascism.

### Mexican Foreign Minister Padilla Resigns

Lisbon, 13th (Central News Agency) - According to news from Mexico City: Mexican Foreign Minister Padilla has submitted his resignation to the President and has been approved.

### Simla Conference at a Standstill

Tokyo, 13th (Central News Agency) - The Simla Conference, which is discussing the British proposal for India, is currently at a standstill. This proposal is a repeat of the "Cripps Mission" of March 1942, so Mother Ning said that this conference is a concrete expression of a part of the Cripps Mission, so it is extremely dangerous to make the results of the Simla Conference decide important matters. However, the National Congress Party, which vehemently rejected the "Cripps Proposal" in April 1942, actually attended the Simla Round Table Conference convened by Viceroy Wavell, which is of great significance. However, why has the National Congress Party, which has stubbornly continued to resist the British government for a long time, suddenly changed its past attitude? We must consider the quiet changes in the past three years. The tense situation when the Japanese army was about to suppress the Indian border in the spring of 1942 is obviously very different from today's situation, in which the war against Germany has ended and the direct threat to the Indian border has been completely removed.

### Old Tricks to Co-opt India Resurfaced

The cunning British have fully understood this international situation, so they have refurbished the old version and presented the old case again, forcing the various factions in India to agree, and the Congress Party also fully understands this intention of the British. On the 30th, Gandhi Weng also said at the Simla Conference: "The Congress Party knows that the Simla Conference is a prelude to Indian independence, so it is participating," because they know that in this situation, only attending the Simla Conference can be said to contribute to India, so they began to participate in this conference. Moreover, we expected that Gandhi Weng, who would attend the meeting together with Acharya, the chairman of the National Congress Party, would actually serve as the advisor to the Governor-General and the Congress Party, and promote the meeting outside the formal meeting seat in Simla, actively progressing. From this, we can also know the attitude taken by the Congress Party and Gandhi Weng towards the Simla Conference. Therefore, without looking at the statement of Nehru, the leader of the National Congress Party, we can clearly understand the attitude taken by the party towards the new proposal, that there is no other good strategy than to advance step by step in a down-to-earth manner. The dominant class in the National Congress Party is of the same opinion, and the attitude of the Muslim League, which is opposed to the Congress Party, is also quite noticeable.

### British and American Forces in Berlin Take Over Military Government; Britain Awards Highest-Ranking Soviet Generals

Stockholm, 13th (Central News Agency) - According to news from Stockholm: General Montgomery awarded the British Cross to Soviet General Zhukov a few days ago, and awarded the Knight's Cross to General Rokossovsky. At the same time, Soviet Chief of General Staff Sokolovsky and MacLein were awarded the Knight's Cross. The awarding ceremony was held at the Brandenburg Gate.

Editorial

### Rectifying the Financial Market

These past few days, letters criticizing the phenomena in the financial sector have been pouring in like snowflakes, urging us to stand on the side of the people, uphold justice, offer suggestions to the authorities, give sincere advice to the financial sector, and find a way for the general public to maintain their basic living standards. Most of these letters come from citizens who have suffered losses from discounted drafts and cash, but there are also many people from the financial and industrial sectors who point out the darkness and crises in the current financial sector, hoping that we will publicly disclose these letters to clarify right and wrong and to prevent some financial practitioners from suffering unjust grievances. Our newspaper fulfills its mission as the voice of the people; we will not hesitate to pursue what is beneficial to the community, as long as it aligns with justice. In principle, we should consider accepting the requests of our readers. However, in handling issues, we strive to avoid personal biases and must recognize the objective environment; otherwise, the actual repercussions may not be beneficial to the community. Therefore, we are not preparing to publish these letters for the time being, not because of a lack of a sense of justice or courage, but because we hope everyone understands this.

Regarding the current credit currency issue, judging from the newspapers and the statements of the authorities, we cannot say that the central and municipal authorities are "standing idly by." The authorities have indeed made efforts and are continuing to do their best to seek solutions. The promulgation of various countermeasures, the recent investigations into illegal activities in the financial market, the punishment of a large number of practitioners, and the public announcements all demonstrate the authorities' proactive spirit of responsibility. Therefore, we cannot blindly echo those who simply criticize the authorities' attitude.

The crux of today's problem lies not in the authorities' "disregard for the people's livelihood," but in how the authorities will solve this major problem that is threatening the people's livelihood. This is what the media unanimously regrets. For example, abolishing drafts and replacing them with bank drafts from various banks is not only a superficial solution that treats the symptoms rather than the root cause, but it is also like giving a strong purgative to a patient who is already weak, making the serious credit currency problem even more severe. After all, drafts are a form of credit currency guaranteed by the national bank, while bank drafts can be issued by any bank or money shop. Even if the authorities have various preventative measures, the following dangerous phenomena cannot be denied:

First, allowing various banks and money shops to issue bank drafts in place of cash, and giving bank drafts circulating value, is tantamount to acknowledging that each bank and money shop has the power to issue currency in disguise. The national bank's currency issuance was already showing signs of expansion, and it had to adopt measures such as issuing various treasury bonds and gold certificates to withdraw currency. Now, openly allowing hundreds of financial institutions to have the right to issue currency in disguise will undoubtedly stimulate the financial sector and public sentiment. This need not be elaborated upon.

Second, among the currencies currently circulating, the highest denomination of Central Reserve Bank notes is only 5,000 yuan (the 10,000 yuan note was just issued today), and according to the amended provisions of the newly promulgated Central Reserve Bank regulations, the highest denomination of notes issued is also only 10,000 yuan. However, the bank drafts issued by various banks and money shops can be issued arbitrarily. 5,000 or 10,000 yuan has become the minimum denomination, and 1 million, 2 million, or even 10 million is not surprising. As a result, on the one hand, the credit of bank drafts is universally devalued (even affecting the bank drafts of major banks), creating a dual-price system in the market. On the other hand, the circulation of such large-denomination credit currency will inevitably shift its negative impact to Central Reserve Bank notes, proportionally devaluing the credit value of Central Reserve Bank notes.

Third, the circulation of bank drafts cannot realistically be equivalent to Central Reserve Bank notes, and their denominations are not as small as Central Reserve Bank notes, making them inconvenient to use, resulting in their prices trending downwards. Those who possess large sums of money can use them to speculate and shift risks to banks and money shops. It can be said that they have one more tool to harm social finance, without any inconvenience or disadvantage. The most affected are the general salaried class and legitimate industrialists and merchants, who have no choice but to endure the pain of exchanging cash at a discount of about 20%. The salaried class can only endure this heavy exploitation, while the losses suffered by industrialists and merchants must be passed on to customers, causing prices to rise to ever-higher peaks without limit.

The individual punishment of 35 banks and money shops in the city this time is undoubtedly a manifestation of the effectiveness of financial inspections. However, among all the banks and money shops in the city, whether only these few should be punished, and whether it is fair, we still have doubts based on observations from various sources. To be honest, certain banks and money shops with Central Reserve Bank personnel as their background must be subjected to particularly strict inspections. If there is solid evidence of harming finance, they should be severely punished in order to deter the stubborn and achieve fairness and impartiality. As for the harm of cash discounts, it is most profound and widespread for the common people, and is simply a weapon that kills without drawing blood. Banks and money shops restrict cash withdrawals for customers, claiming that the Central Reserve Bank's supply is insufficient, but some banks and money shops inevitably take the opportunity to use this as a pretext for illicit dealings, which is also an opportunity given by the Central Reserve Bank. Moreover, there are many rumors about a few Central Reserve Bank employees engaging in cash discounts. For example, a certain level of employee can withdraw a certain amount of cash every day, and the amount they withdraw far exceeds their salary. What do these people do with this cash? Also, a certain level of Central Reserve Bank employee can withdraw cash after depositing notes, and can repeatedly discount them to reap huge profits. Therefore, strictly speaking, if the supply of cash is indeed severely insufficient, then why can it be rolled over once discounted? This shows that the cash panic is entirely man-made, especially caused by the monopoly of certain special classes. It is rumored that the Central Reserve Bank management has already discovered some illegal employees and punished them. We believe that since there is such determination and fact, the names and crimes of the illegal elements should be publicly exposed so that the public can condemn them and serve as a warning to others.

According to the ideals of the general public, the issue of credit currency should not have arisen in the first place. Because as long as the government is determined, it has already withdrawn drafts, and now it can further prohibit banks and money shops from issuing bank drafts (unless customers request it themselves), and the Central Reserve Bank should reasonably allocate cash to each bank and money shop, and the central government should directly bear all financial responsibilities, which would make the control of bank and money shop operations much easier.

However, we must state that, first, the current credit currency crisis is very deep, and the relevant authorities must think with a long-term vision, consider the interests of all the people in the peace zone, and quickly seek fair and effective countermeasures. Second, the implementation of a truly effective method will inevitably affect some people who profit from the bad system, but "why should one family cry when an entire road cries?" The authorities should have great benevolence and courage; moreover, these few people have already filled their pockets and will definitely not cry! Third, there should be stricter inspections and unified management of all banks and money shops. Bank drafts must be cashed when they mature, and new bank drafts cannot be issued. At the same time, in order to show impartiality in the allocation of cash to each bank and money shop, the Central Reserve Bank's issuing agency should consult with the banking and money shop industries and make a public decision.

The mission of the financial industry is to promote the prosperity of the country and society, help the entire economy be vibrant, and stabilize people's livelihoods. Therefore, the financial industry should make positive contributions, even under the restrictions of wartime conditions, but at least there should not be the opposite phenomenon of harming people's livelihood and economy.

### Ramblings on the European War (1)

The European war is over. Looking back at the fighting situation of Germany, the Soviet Union, and the United States in Europe, we can see many extremely strange and interesting phenomena. Now, I will summarize the news from all sides and describe it as follows:

### Germany's War Aims

First, let's talk about the Soviet Union. More than half of the Soviet Union's European territory was destroyed by the German army. When the German army retreated, it burned everything in Soviet territory, regardless of cities or villages, so the hard work of the Soviet Union's three five-year plans was completely turned to ashes. However, in combat, the Red Army took the frontal attack method. For strongholds that hindered its advance or resisted, it concentrated artillery fire to destroy them. But in places where there was no resistance, the Red Army did not attack indiscriminately. Even the Red Army's air raids were always tactical bombings. Throughout the entire German-Soviet war, the Red Army's strategic bombings were only a few times, and limited to oil fields or purely military facilities. The Soviet Air Force's bombing of Berlin was also a small-scale air raid of reconnaissance flight, so the citizens of Berlin believed that the bombing from the east was not dangerous. However, the Soviet Air Force's strength was not small. About 20,000 aircraft were gathered at the front line, which was comparable to the British and Americans.

On the other hand, the U.S. military's destruction of Germany had no mercy. When bombing, regardless of whether it was military equipment, residential areas, or historical monuments, everything that could be destroyed was their bombing target. Their reason was to dampen the German people's will to fight, but they knew that such actions had little effect. Therefore, their true intention was clearly to completely destroy European culture.

After Berlin was bombed several times, two houses on Mingxing Street miraculously remained undamaged, proudly standing among the ashes. However, not long after, the American planes discovered them, and specially flew to bomb them, concentrating large bombs. As a result, these two houses could not escape the fate of being turned into piles of rubble. Another example is Dresden, which had no military equipment and no munitions factories. Since ancient times, it has been a peaceful city of academics and medicine, so everyone guessed that American planes would not visit and drop bombs. Who knew that after they had destroyed all the German cities, they finally flew to bomb this peaceful city. With one strike, the city was destroyed, and 200,000 citizens were killed or injured. Today, within Germany, there is probably no city with a population of more than 50,000 that can be preserved. Even small towns with more than 10,000 people can hardly escape this disaster. For example, Klenzwou, a small town on the Otter River with a population of only 12,000, was the site of the last fierce battle between Germany and the Soviet Union, and before it was occupied by the Soviet army, the American air force arrived first and destroyed it in one fell swoop.

However, even though the situation was like this, Germany claimed that its war aim was: first, to remove the threat from the Bolsheviks in the east. So it loudly called for the formation of an anti-Soviet crusade, and advocated long-term unity with the so-called democratic countries to establish a common front. When Germany had not yet surrendered, it even hoped to compromise with Britain and the United States and continue the war against the Soviet Union. However, in actual combat, perhaps due to geographical conditions, the V1, V2, and other new weapons were completely used to deal with Britain and the United States. This is truly an incredible phenomenon.

### Katyusha Rocket Launcher

If we look at the quality of weapons, the reason for Germany's failure can be specifically pointed out as the Soviet Union's tanks and the British and American air forces. Hitler, who prided himself on Germany being the most scientifically advanced country, also praised the Soviet Union's tanks, saying that their quality and quantity were quite impressive. And especially among the artillery used by the Soviet Union, he thought the newly developed Katyusha cannon was particularly terrible.

The Katyusha cannon is composed of more than a dozen small rocket launchers linked together. As long as the trigger is pulled, dozens of rocket shells will hit the same target at the same time. No matter how strong the position is, it can be destroyed in one fell swoop. It is indeed a terrible new weapon. The name Katyusha is not the heroine in Tolstoy's famous book "Resurrection," but the name of a Soviet woman who stood up in front of the guerrilla forces and fought bravely when the German army occupied European Russia. Like the French Joan of Arc (Jeanne darc), she established many merits in the bloody battle to defend her country. Therefore, in order to forever commemorate her merits, the Soviet authorities named this new type of cannon after her. They also specially made a "Katyusha Song" and sang it all over the country. (To be continued)

### Municipal Government Orders Economic Bureau to Strictly Prohibit Rice Manipulation; Close Attention Paid to Merchants Stockpiling at Any Time

Since the Municipal Economic Bureau was ordered to abolish the emergency measures for rice control, it has been paying close attention to the hoarding and manipulation of rice by merchants in the city. Recently, the Municipal Government issued an order stating that "at the beginning of the opening of rice transportation, it is feared that a small number of merchants will take the opportunity to hoard rice, and that the主管官署 in various places will restrict the flow of rice under the pretext of maintaining food supply within the territory." It has been notified to the relevant agencies to effectively prevent these situations. In order to make the above-mentioned measures more effective, the Municipal Government has ordered its subordinates to strictly investigate and prohibit merchants from hoarding and manipulating rice, and from restricting its circulation under the pretext of any reason, in order to eliminate abuses and emphasize the importance of orders." After receiving the order, the Bureau, considering that the case is related to the people's food supply, in addition to ordering its subordinates to strictly investigate and prohibit such activities, it has also been paying close attention to the hoarding and manipulation of merchants at any time.

### Improvement of Prison Sanitation Committee Holds Second Meeting Yesterday; Discussion of Various Implementation Plans

It has been reported in this newspaper that Shanghai's prisons were previously overcrowded and the weather was gradually getting hotter. Wu Songfeng, Minister of Judicial Administration, and public-spirited individuals such as Li Sihao, Lin Kanghou, Chen Binhe, etc., initiated the fundraising of a fund for the improvement of sanitation, and organized a management committee. On the afternoon of the 12th of this month, the committee convened another meeting. In addition to the heads of judicial organs, members such as Lin Kanghou, Chen Riping, Chen Binhe, Kong Xianyi, and Yuan Rongchang (substituting for Section Chief Guo) also attended. The meeting was chaired by Minister Wu, who discussed the implementation plan for improving sanitation, urging prisons to actively cooperate with the Municipal Health Bureau to carry out measures such as adding doctors and nurses, adding medicines and sanitary equipment, changing clothes and bathing, and large-scale disinfection. Yuan Jufan, Director of the Health Bureau, was also hired as a member. All funds are deposited in banks, and interest is used monthly for permanent use. The discussion on the issue of prisoner rations lasted for a long time. It was generally agreed that the supply of food was difficult. At present, five合口 rations are provided, with four合 of mixed grains (麫頭) mixed with one合 of rice. This may affect the nutrition of prisoners. It is hoped that the distribution can be expanded in the near future to alleviate the prisoners' plight. Since Wu has been in charge of justice, he has been working hard to improve the welfare of prisoners, which is a great blessing to them.

### Police Bureau Adjusts Personnel Selection for Branch Bureau Chiefs

The vacant position will be filled by Guan Tiehuan, chief of the Penglai Road Branch Bureau. Rong Hanyi, chief of the Zhabei Branch Bureau, will be transferred to the Penglai Road Branch Bureau as chief. The vacant position will be filled by Chen Xixian, deputy section chief of the Second Division of the Security Section. At the same time, all chiefs and deputy chiefs of branch bureaus must reside in the bureau to handle official duties.

### Adjustment of Section Chiefs of Three Sections of Branch Bureaus

There are also adjustments to the section chiefs of the third section of each branch bureau. Shang Wu, chief of the third section of the Huashan Road Branch Bureau, will be transferred to the Yimiao Branch Bureau as chief of the third section. Zhong Zijian, chief of the third section of the Huangpu Branch Bureau, will be exchanged with Shi Yuxiang, chief of the third section of the Jiangning Road Branch Bureau. Huang Yingjie, chief of the third section of the Jing'an Temple Branch Bureau, will be transferred to the Huashan Road Branch Bureau as chief of the third section.

In addition, there are also transfers of plainclothes patrol officers.

### Reorganization of the Security Police Brigade

In order to refresh the organization and strengthen security forces, the Municipal Police Bureau reorganized the establishment of the three brigades under the Security Police Brigade. Each brigade is divided into three companies, each company is divided into three platoons, each platoon is divided into three squads, and the number of police officers in each squad is set at twelve. The original first, second, and third companies are still under the first brigade. The fourth company of the original first brigade is transferred to the second brigade.

### Central Reserve Bank Starts Issuing 10,000 Yuan Notes Today to Meet the Cash Needs of the Market

In view of the continuous rise in prices recently, the value of goods requires several times more currency in circulation. In addition, speculators hoard materials and unscrupulous financial institutions try to make profits by discounting cash, causing the demand for cash to become increasingly scarce. In order to solve the difficulty of cash demand and eliminate the abuses of discounting, the Central Reserve Bank has, on the one hand, inspected the business of financial institutions and cracked down on attempts to make profits by hoarding and discounting cash. On the other hand, it has decided to issue new 10,000 yuan notes starting today (13th) in order to smooth circulation and meet the cash needs of the market. The issuance of this new note will not stimulate prices, because it is an urgent need at present. The notice of the issuance of new notes by the bank is recorded as follows: "This bank will issue a 10,000 yuan note of the 33rd year version in gray-brown color from today. The front side is printed with the portrait of the Founding Father in the center, with the red note number printed on the upper left and right, and the seal of the president and vice president of the bank printed on the lower left and right. The back side is printed with the image of the Founding Father's mausoleum in the center, with the Western signatures of the president and vice president of the bank printed on the lower left and right. This 10,000 yuan note is universally valid with all kinds of notes issued by this bank. This is hereby announced."

### Second Phase of Epidemic Prevention Injections Scheduled to Begin

The Municipal Epidemic Prevention Committee held its fifth standing committee meeting at 5:00 p.m. on the 12th in the Municipal Government Conference Room, and welcomed and sent off the new and old deputy directors. Those present included: Colonel Katsuyama Susumu of the Marine Corps, Major General Shibata Toshio, Lieutenant Colonel Sakai of the Fuji Detachment, Technician Matsuzaki of the Embassy, new deputy director Yuan Jufan, Chen Zongxian, director of the Central Epidemic Prevention Office, Shen Guanzhun, advisor of the Municipal Government, Nagai, advisor, Yoshiaki Tashiro, director of the Jianghai Customs Quarantine Station, Chen Yitong, secretary, and more than 20 other people. The meeting was chaired by the new deputy director Yuan Jufan. First, Secretary Chen Yi expressed a welcome speech to the new and old deputy directors. Subsequently, it was discussed and resolved that: the second phase of epidemic prevention injections will begin on July 21. The municipal government will be requested to issue a public announcement encouraging the public to voluntarily request injections in order to prevent the invasion of epidemics. Several teams of mixed teams for forced injection and inspection will be organized to work on the streets. Citizens who do not have permits will be given forced injections. At the end, the chairman expressed his views, stating that: this year, due to various reasons, the possibility of the occurrence of epidemics is particularly strong. If we do not take careful precautions in advance, the losses will be unimaginable once it unfortunately occurs. Therefore, on the one hand, we must step up the injection work, and on the other hand, we must crack down on substandard cold drinks and food products, without the slightest relaxation, in order to achieve twice the result with half the effort.

### Methods of Fundraising for Student Aid: A Hope for General Students

Although the student aid recipients of this newspaper's student aid fund are over 3,700, this is still a very small number compared to the total number of students in schools of all levels. The number of non-recipient students in schools at all levels is dozens of times higher than that of recipient students. However, their educational opportunities should be equal. Because of the vast differences in family economy and living environment, poor students, even with talent and diligent study, still find it difficult to overcome their current difficulties! Therefore, we sincerely ask the general students to have absolute sympathy for the poor students, to show a kind heart for relief, and to demonstrate it to everyone with facts.

The so-called factual demonstration refers to economic assistance. For example, the "special fundraising" campaign for student aid currently being promoted by this newspaper is an excellent opportunity. Please come to our office to pick up printed materials and actively solicit donations from friends and relatives to complete the 300 million yuan goal as soon as possible. This will ensure that thousands of poor and excellent student aid recipients do not drop out of school, and that the country and society avoid suffering a huge loss. "Heaven helps those who help themselves." May you all consider these words carefully!

### Ninth Session of the Shen Bao Reader Student Aid Special Fundraising Team

Ordinary Team 24th Team: Anonymous Team, 200,000 yuan. 25th Team: Liang You Team, 100,000 yuan. Total collected above 300,000 yuan, bringing the grand total to 6,299,000 yuan.

Movie star Li Xianglan will also be present to serve the opening ball, making it a very rare event. The entire program includes seven exhibition matches, with the most exciting being the men's singles and doubles exhibitions. The singles exhibition between Wang Wenzheng and Tao Guanqiu can be said to be a battle for the championship of men's tennis in this city. Tao and Wang's skills are well-known and will certainly be an extremely exciting performance. The doubles pairings are also well-matched. Xu Chengwei, a national team player, has made significant progress in his skills, reminiscent of his father, Xu Chengji. Tickets are divided into two types: honorary tickets for 50,000 yuan and ordinary tickets for 20,000 yuan. Those who love tennis and have not seen great performances for a long time, why not come? Tickets are also sold at the social service department of this newspaper, but the number is limited, so first come, first served.

### Director Yuan of the Health Bureau Discusses Future Policy Guidelines: Intensifying Epidemic Prevention and Strengthening Air Raid First Aid

The Municipal Propaganda Office held a regular press conference at the Municipal Government yesterday (13th) at 10:30 AM. The newly appointed Director Yuan Jufan of the Municipal Health Bureau attended and answered questions from reporters from various newspapers regarding health administration, public health, treatment institutions, and air raid first aid in detail. The details are as follows:

### Four Major Guidelines for Health Work

(Question) The Health Bureau's central tasks in the future, which you, Director, have decided to be: 1. Garbage disposal; 2. Intensifying epidemic prevention; 3. Strictly cracking down on cold drinks and food products; 4. Air raid first aid. Can you tell us about the implementation plans? In particular, when will the accumulated garbage in various places during the summer season be cleared? (Answer) Regarding the above four major guidelines, they are the central tasks after I took office. Except for the garbage and the crackdown on substandard food, which will be answered in questions four, six, five, and eight, I will first talk about intensifying epidemic prevention and air raid first aid. Based on experience, epidemic prevention work needs to be intensified every summer to prevent cholera from occurring and spreading. Therefore, promoting citizen participation in epidemic prevention injections is an important task. If the situation requires it, mandatory injections should be resolutely implemented. At the same time, personnel engaged in epidemic prevention work should be ordered to be self-disciplined and to redouble their efforts in their respective positions. The Bureau also plans to make full use of the beds in municipal isolation hospitals and private epidemic hospitals to accommodate patients in the event of an epidemic. However, it is known that municipal and private epidemic hospitals currently have only about 500 beds, which will not be enough when necessary. In order to prevent the possible occurrence of epidemics, the Bureau will actively formulate plans for accommodating patients and promote them in order to prevent problems before they occur. As for the issue of air raid first aid, it is also one of the important tasks at present. In the event of an air raid, the mortality rate will definitely be high. The Citizens' Air Defense Headquarters already has a first aid plan, but in order to alleviate the suffering of the citizens and reduce the mortality rate, the Bureau is also preparing for the future. On the one hand, the relevant department is ordered to formulate an air raid first aid and accommodation plan; on the other hand, the Bureau is actively strengthening and enriching air raid treatment work in order to make full use of municipal and private hospitals when necessary.

### Refusal to Treat Patients by Hospitals is Illegal

(Question) How many institutions are affiliated with the Health Bureau, and what is the status of their work? (Answer) The Health Bureau can now be divided into two points: First, health administration, its affiliated institutions, including the five district health offices in the east, south, west, north, and center. Second, treatment institutions, including Chang'an Road, Hubai, Huxi, Huna, and other isolation hospitals, Shaoxing Road Hospital, Pudong Hospital, Xiaosadu Road and Fanwangdu Hospitals, Gongji Hospital's Clinic, Hongzhen Clinic, and many other places. Other hospitals and clinics in the suburbs have been directly placed under the command of the counties and districts, and the Bureau is responsible for supervision.

(Question) Major hospitals in this city refuse to treat poor patients. Even in the case of emergency, hospitals require payment of a large amount of consultation fees before treatment. Such hospitals that disregard human life are like empty shells. What does the Health Bureau plan to do? (Answer) The Bureau attaches great importance to this issue and feels deeply regret for the hospitals. Asking patients to pay before receiving them is indeed a disregard for human life. There are also cases where pregnant women going to the hospital for delivery are required to pay cash and full fees. I plan to convene a meeting with the directors of the hospitals in the near future to resolve these problems and seek a thorough solution.

### Deadline for Clearing Accumulated Garbage

(Question) The garbage in the Nanshi and Zhabei areas has not been completely cleared. In particular, the amount of feces and urine in various open spaces continues to increase. Not only does it stink, but it also breeds flies and mosquitoes, which poses a major threat to health in the summer. Does the Director have any concrete measures to deal with it? (Answer) Regarding the garbage problems in the first, fourth, sixth, and eighth questions, I will now answer them together: The current serious situation of garbage accumulation can be said to be the most common and basic problem in public health. What is common and basic? The most common thing is that the garbage is shipped out as soon as it arrives at the dock, and the problem is solved. The most basic thing is that if there is garbage accumulation on the road, the citizens will have a special impression and feeling. This is the basic problem in public health. The current accumulation of garbage in several places and the large accumulation at various garbage docks are due to the failure of ships to arrive and transport garbage at any time, and the abnormal dispatch of ships, resulting in the docks being full and the vehicles piling up in designated directions and areas. This is purely because the garbage has no way out, and it is definitely not the result of the cleaners' ineffective work. In the future, the way out is to improve the adjustment of ship rentals. Regardless of old or new garbage, except for the special circumstances of Maigen Road and Rihui Port, the rest can be completely cleared within one month after the contractor is determined. According to the investigation, the problem of garbage and feces in the North and South cities is not limited to the North and South cities, but also exists in the central area. We will do our best to deal with it as much as possible. In particular, indiscriminate urination and defecation will seriously affect public health. We sincerely hope that all citizens will respect themselves and strictly control themselves. At the same time, we plan to contact the Municipal Police Bureau to seek comprehensive suppression.

### Strictly Cracking Down on Unhygienic Food

(Question) There are food vendors everywhere on the streets, most of which have no sanitary facilities. Should the Bureau formulate measures to crack down on them to make them comply with summer hygiene? (Answer) The Bureau has launched a comprehensive campaign to crack down on such substandard food. For example, 5,427 catties of natural ice, ice cream, colored water, jelly, sour plum soup, peeled fruits, and sugarcane that have been found to be unhygienic during recent inspections have all been sold and destroyed, because these food products do not meet the Bureau's regulations and are mostly rotten. If eaten, they can cause diarrhea and illness in mild cases, and spread diseases in severe cases. Most citizens are at risk of being infected. In order to protect the health of the citizens, the Bureau will not condone a few vendors and affect the health of the majority of citizens. In the future, we will strictly crack down on vendors.

### Gradually Improving Health Institutions

(Question) How do you feel about being the new Director of the Health Bureau? Can you tell us about the future policy guidelines? (Answer) The central tasks of the Bureau have been detailed in the previous answers. However, I now feel that the health administration structure is still not simple and unified enough, and I plan to gradually improve it in the future. (Question) The air-raid shelters dug along the roads are accumulating rainwater and breeding mosquitoes. We would like to ask the Bureau to inform the citizens to order nearby residents to clear them at any time to protect the health of the citizens. (Answer) The Citizens' Air Defense Headquarters has formulated detailed measures for the management of air-raid shelters. In the future, the Bureau plans to contact the Bao Li Office and the Air Defense Headquarters to task the Bao Jia with ordering residents to clear the rainwater at any time to prevent the breeding of mosquitoes.

### Summer Education Lecture: The Third Lecture Tomorrow Morning

### Two Hospitals Give Preferential Treatment to Poor Patients

Baoli Hospital: Baoli Hospital, which has been preparing for several months, is scheduled to open at 10:00 AM on the 15th of this month. At the same time, the naming ceremony of "Mo Jun People's Obstetrics Room" and "Shu Ru Infant Room" will be held.

Pregnant women in the Hongkou district can apply directly to the hospital at 812 North Sichuan Road for hospitalization and delivery (telephone 44012). Schools and organizations that need free physical examinations can also apply to the hospital's social service department.

Chengji Hospital: Chengji Hospital, located at 50 Dengmei Road (intersection of Huage Nie Road), treats internal medicine, surgery, gynecology, and pediatrics. It provides medical treatment and medicine all year round. It has free diagnosis and medicine vouchers. Poor families can pick them up from the following locations: Social Service Department of this newspaper, Social Service Department of Xinwen Bao, Buddhist Fellowship, Taishan Road Moral Bookstore. Consultation hours: 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM.
