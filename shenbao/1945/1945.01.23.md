Tokyo, 22nd (Central News Agency Telegram) – The Japanese General Headquarters announced at 3 PM on the 22nd: (1) The main force of enemy troops that landed along the Lingayen coast has continuously attacked the Japanese first-line positions near Damortis and Cabaruan. A portion of the enemy troops infiltrated the area near Pozorrubio, between the Japanese first and second-line positions. Local Japanese troops fought bravely and continuously destroyed the enemy's attacks. (2) Since the enemy's landing, the main results of the Japanese army's land battles in this area, as determined by the 19th, are as follows: over 6,000 enemy personnel killed or wounded, 59 enemy cannons captured or destroyed, 67 tanks, 26 vehicles, 42 tents, and a large number of other weapons, ammunition, and supplies.

Lingayen Front, 22nd (Central News Agency Telegram) – The enemy forces in Luzon are attempting to advance towards the Luzon Plain with mobile units, moving south along the Manila Highway for several days, but their attempt has been thwarted by the Japanese army. The Japanese army also landed in the enemy's rear from the bay, using commando units to block their advance, thus the enemy's progress is extremely slow. Although some of their tank-equipped units have moved south to certain locations, their main force remains stalled in the Lingayen coastal area. On the 19th, a portion of the enemy's main force approached the Japanese base northeast of Biti, and was repelled by a fierce Japanese counterattack. Two enemy battalions carrying four mortars in the Damortis-La Union area launched a slow bombardment from the coast, which ceased after a fierce Japanese attack. The American troops who infiltrated 4 kilometers east of La Union are currently being mopped up by the Japanese army. An enemy battalion, led by several tanks, attempted a flanking attack to infiltrate Pozorrubio (15 kilometers east of San Fabian), but was fiercely attacked by Japanese elite troops, killing or wounding eight of them before being repelled. The enemy's heavy artillery, which had been firing wildly since landing, has been silenced by the active daytime and nighttime efforts of Japanese commando and flamethrower units. However, the enemy's resources and will to fight have not diminished. Although the main forces of the two armies have not yet made contact, the situation is extremely tense.

### Heavily Damaged Four Enemy Warships off the Coast of Taiwan: Japanese Kamikaze Units Demonstrate Special Attack Spirit

Tokyo, 22nd (Central News Agency Telegram) – Since the 3rd, the enemy forces on the Luzon battlefront have once again deployed powerful mobile units in the Bashi Channel and the South China Sea, using their carrier-based aircraft to repeatedly attack Taiwan, Okinawa, and various parts of South China. On the 21st, 450 carrier-based aircraft repeatedly attacked the Taiwan and Okinawa areas. On that day, Japanese Kamikaze special attack units, divided into two groups and escorted by direct support fighters, launched a determined and accurate attack on this enemy mobile unit, severely damaging three enemy aircraft carriers and one warship of unknown type, causing major fires. The Japanese special attack units demonstrated a great special attack spirit by attacking one ship with each aircraft. In the afternoon of the 21st, one group of Japanese Kamikaze special attack units surrounded a group of enemy mobile units in the waters several miles east of Taiwan and immediately launched a fierce attack on them. One Japanese aircraft immediately hit a large enemy aircraft carrier, causing a major fire. Another aircraft hit the bow of a large enemy aircraft carrier, seriously damaging it. Another group of Japanese special attack units also surrounded a group of enemy mobile units near the coast of Taiwan. After a fierce aerial battle with enemy escort fighters, they broke through and attacked the enemy ships, with one aircraft hitting an enemy aircraft carrier and another aircraft hitting an enemy warship of unknown type, causing them to catch fire respectively. These results have been confirmed by Japanese direct support aircraft. Furthermore, the enemy aircraft carriers that caught fire after being attacked by Japanese aircraft were subjected to fierce attacks by the Japanese special attack units. The so-called "heavily damaged and catching fire" is practically equivalent to being sunk, and the damage is very extensive.

### Japanese House of Representatives Held Plenary Session Yesterday: Finance Minister Ishiwata Explains Wartime Finances

Tokyo, 22nd (Central News Agency Telegram) – The Japanese House of Representatives held a plenary session at 10:30 AM on the 22nd to discuss important bills: the Public Bond Act for supplementing the fiscal resources for the general accounting expenditures of the Showa 20th year, and the Foreign Capital Bank Act. Eighteen committee members thoroughly discussed the bills based on the explanation of the reasons for the proposal by Finance Minister Ishiwata. Finally, each committee member delivered eulogies in memory of the achievements of the deceased Diet members. The session adjourned satisfactorily at 11:57 AM.

Tokyo, 22nd (Central News Agency Telegram) – The main points of Finance Minister Ishiwata's financial address at the House of Representatives meeting held on the 21st are as follows: The total budget for the Showa 20th year, both revenue and expenditure, is over 22.4 billion yen. The focus of the policies is on strengthening war power and securing food supplies. Efforts will be made to increase the expenses for items that are particularly important for completing the operations. In order to adapt to the changes in the war situation and ensure budget flexibility, the national treasury reserve fund will be increased. The first reserve fund is 200 million yen, and the second reserve fund is 2 billion yen. In this way, the wartime budget has been completed without regrets. Since the outbreak of the China Incident, the total amount of public bonds issued is over 84.97 billion yen, the amount sold is over 76.79 billion yen, and the amount sold is over 25.01 billion yen. Therefore, there are no obstacles in using public bonds as a source of funds for war expenses and in the execution of the budget, and the sales of public bonds are trending smoothly. The target amount for increasing national savings is 41 billion yen. In terms of actual performance, bank savings in the first half of the lower fiscal year are approximately 15.4 billion yen, postal savings are approximately 7.9 billion yen, and the increase in the total of other various savings has reached 34.5 billion yen. Regarding economic countermeasures in the event of air raids, a wartime emergency financial countermeasure has already been established. Furthermore, a wartime special damage insurance system has been created, and efforts have been made to reduce tax burdens and other measures, which have been gradually improved and strengthened. These systems are gradually becoming thorough and are having a considerable effect on stabilizing people's livelihood in emergency situations. Secondly, immense financial and economic assistance has been provided to various countries and ethnic groups within the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, and their economic development has been assisted. This has long been known to the people of the country. Even under severe war conditions, we will overcome all difficulties and spare no effort to provide full support in the future, and devote more efforts to building the Greater East Asia economy.

### Japan Will Implement New Economic Policies Towards China: Mr. Shigemitsu Answers Questions from Diet Members

Tokyo, 22nd (Central News Agency Telegram) – Japanese Diet member Mr. Kanezaki Tsuneo raised questions to Foreign Minister Shigemitsu on the 21st regarding China policy. He replied that the maintenance of good neighborly relations and friendly ties are paramount, and that new economic policies are under consideration to improve the impoverished economy of China. Foreign Minister Shigemitsu strongly stated that, based on the five principles of diplomacy, actively cooperating in the realization of Sino-Japanese cooperation is essential. To achieve this, it is necessary to first firmly establish good neighborly and friendly relations, completely expel the aggressive forces of Britain and the United States from China, and jointly strive for the comprehensive peace of China based on equality and mutual benefit. Regarding the solution of the urgent economic problems in China at present, the economic policy towards China will be improved in cooperation with China. Although Foreign Minister Shigemitsu did not provide concrete explanations for this new economic policy, it is worthy of anticipation given his active sincerity.

### Japan's War Aim: To Establish Lasting Peace: Japanese Foreign Minister Shigemitsu Clarifies Diplomatic Policy

Close cooperation to Revitalize East Asia: The defense of the Philippines has become the focal point of the defense of East Asia. Therefore, after the United States initiated the invasion, the Philippines immediately and resolutely declared war on the United States. Under the guidance of President Laurel, it is fighting bravely alongside the Japanese army, which has attracted worldwide attention. Another war to defend East Asia is Burma. Since Burma's independence, which occurred a year and a half ago, under the outstanding leadership of Mr. Ba Maw, the country has stood on the front line of the battle to liberate Asia, and continues to struggle, which is truly encouraging for the people of East Asia. The liberation of India is the key to the liberation of Asia and the focus of upholding world justice. Informed people have long recognized this. Chairman Bose leads the Free Indian Army to make the greatest efforts to liberate India. Although it is expected that there will be some difficulties ahead, it is firmly believed that it will eventually complete this great achievement. Thailand, as an ally of Japan, has formed a new cabinet and is cooperating with Japan, making the greatest efforts for the great cause of revitalizing East Asia, which is truly exciting. What constitutes the main background of Japan's war power is Manchuria. Manchuria and Japan are of one heart and one mind, and have consolidated their alliance in both material and spiritual aspects, being in a complete cooperative relationship. Its contribution to Japan's war power is extremely significant.

Policy towards China: Equality and Mutual Benefit

The late Mr. Wang, the great pioneer of East Asia in the Republic of China, passed away in the midst of the realization of comprehensive peace, which was a great loss not only in China but also in East Asia. The Japanese government deeply regrets this. However, although Mr. Wang is dead, his spirit still lives on. The National Government, now under the guidance of Mr. Chen Gongbo, inherits the legacy of the late Mr. Wang and the teachings of the founding father of the country, united in the spirit of shared life and death, and dedicated to Sino-Japanese cooperation. Japan's policy towards China, since the implementation of the so-called new policies, has been unwavering. In the future, it will continue to implement this established policy in political and economic aspects, overcoming all difficulties thoroughly. I would like to take this opportunity to briefly address the international issues centered on China. British policy is to make Asians fight each other in order to reap the benefits, and the United States has inherited this. This has been clearly revealed. They know very well that Japan

Realizing Peace and Completely Withdrawing Troops: Their policy is a major enemy of destroying East Asian stability. This destructive policy is ultimately incompatible with Japan's construction policy. The aim of Japan's policy towards China is to build a new China based on a mutually beneficial relationship. China and Japan have previously agreed to return China to the hands of the Chinese people. What we hope for is to contribute to the great cause of mutually assisting in the revitalization of East Asia. Today, thanks to the advance of the Japanese army, the north-south routes have been opened, and US military bases have been dealt a major blow. Strategically and tactically, completely consistent results have been achieved, which is truly commendable.

Japan's War Aim: To Establish Lasting Peace: Japanese Foreign Minister Shigemitsu Clarifies Diplomatic Policy (End)

At the end cannot be subdued, so they have always used China for their own benefit, in order to achieve their unrealistic ambitions, making China and Japan fight each other, and using sweet words and power to drive China to the anti-Japanese front. They sacrifice China and transfer their own burden of war against Japan, attempting to fulfill their monopolistic and exclusive ambitions on the mainland.

When national peace is realized, Japan will completely withdraw its troops from China. The Greater East Asia War arose from Sino-Japanese issues and should return to Sino-Japanese issues. Only after China returns to normal can East Asian stability be ensured. Japan is now advancing its troops into South China in order to strike at the American army and expel the disruptive forces of the United States from China.

Japanese-Soviet Friendship Remains Unchanged: Japan's relations with neutral countries, except those under British and American influence, continue to maintain friendly relations despite the difficulties of wartime, which is no different from the past. In particular, Sweden, Switzerland, and Spain have been acting as proxies for Japan's interests in enemy countries for a long time, protecting Japanese residents, for which Japan expresses its deep gratitude. Furthermore, the relationship between Japan and the Soviet Union is based on the Neutrality Treaty. The two governments, in light of the current position of Japan and the Soviet Union in the world political situation, maintain close contact. The implementation of the transfer of rights agreement concluded and announced last March, and the exercise of fishing rights in accordance with the Fisheries Treaty, are progressing smoothly. However, lasting world peace cannot be achieved by the military policies of Britain and the United States. World peace can only be achieved through the amity and cooperation between all countries. The spirit of the Greater East Asia Declaration lies in this.

Reiterating the Five Major Principles of Diplomacy: The five major principles of Japanese diplomacy that I declared in the Japanese Parliament are also concrete national policies based on this: First, international relations should be based on equality and mutual benefit, to fully develop good neighborly and friendly relations, to open up a new world of mutual affection between all ethnic groups and countries, and to lay the foundation for lasting peace. Second, respect the policy of nationalism, so that each ethnic group and each country can get what it deserves. Third, in accordance with the principle of non-interference in internal affairs, regardless of the size of the country, its sovereignty and independence should be mutually respected. The form of its rule and guiding ideology are internal affairs of each country, and other countries should not interfere. Fourth, in the field of economy, take cooperation as the aim, realize the principle of mutual benefit, and promote the free development of commerce and transportation, and the mutual release of resources. Fifth, promote international cultural exchange to contribute to world peace and progress.

The Army of Justice Will Eventually Win: In short, Japan's claim is to build a world that does not threaten or invade. The essence of Japan's policy is to take all means to make the countries of the world fully understand. However, Japan's just policy will surely be praised by all countries. The purpose of Japan's war is deeply believed to be recognized by the world, and the war of justice will surely win. This is why we are full of confidence in victory.

### Adjustment Needed for the Seven Counties Under Shanghai's Jurisdiction

The seven counties under Shanghai's jurisdiction – Nanhui, Chuansha, Chongming, Fengxian, Baoshan, Jiading, and Shenjiang – are as closely related to Shanghai as lips are to teeth. Geographically, these seven counties are located on the periphery, protecting Shanghai. From the perspective of the source of Shanghai citizens' living materials, these seven counties are the lifeline of Shanghai citizens. In terms of public security, these seven counties are close to Shanghai. Any public security problem in any county is enough to affect Shanghai's public security. These seven counties occupy such an important position. Now that Shanghai's municipal administration is trying to get on track, in addition to improving Shanghai itself, it is also necessary to focus on political adjustments in the surrounding counties to bring them in line with Shanghai's municipal administration. Bringing them onto the right track is essential to prevent neglect from affecting the implementation of Shanghai's sound municipal policies. This is what is meant by taking care of the overall situation, focusing on the big picture, and starting with the small things.

Shanghai is the most important metropolis in the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. Its every move can affect the whole country. Although the enemy planes' several attacks are a psychological warfare tactic, when the war enters a more urgent stage, why wouldn't the American and other enemies have the delusion of military disruption, even if there are complete plans to turn the enemy's dreams into bubbles? However, we must make more precise and detailed preparations. It is better to be prepared and not use it, than to allow the enemy to succeed in any way. This responsibility rests on the shoulders of the newly appointed municipal leaders. Due to the urgency of the situation, it has become one of the important tasks in the renewal of municipal administration. This task requires not only planning for the security of Shanghai itself, but also ensuring that the seven surrounding counties are equally secure. Only then can Shanghai's security have a foundation. At the critical moment of the final battle, they truly assume the mission of the rear base, and work together to win the victory at the front. To plan and build Shanghai's municipal administration from this point of view, we must focus on the seven counties under the city's jurisdiction, integrate them with the municipal administration, and start to adjust and consolidate the periphery. This is the first point.

Stabilizing people's livelihood is the first goal of the newly appointed municipal leader to renew the municipal administration. The main idea in Mayor Zhou's letter to the citizens is to reduce the suffering of citizens. The fundamental spirit of the three points raised by Secretary-General Luo in his inaugural speech is to ensure that the reduction of suffering is effectively achieved. In simple terms, it is to stabilize people's livelihood. Judging from the current situation, commodity prices are showing a stable trend. If given time, rectifying discipline, and implementing honest politics, when considerable results are achieved, people's livelihood can be more stable. Furthermore, if it can be combined with a planned increase in production, the stability of people's livelihood will be even more guaranteed. However, we are mindful of the ancient saying of "failing for lack of one basketful," and cannot but have far-sighted planning. There are many reasons why Shanghai's people's livelihood is so serious. They are already well-known political common sense. The authorities have long understood the cause of the disease, prepared the medicine, and are prescribing the right medicine, so we don't need to nag anymore. However, we must remind that in the past, the instability of people's livelihood was indeed the responsibility of Shanghai's politics, but the policy of the neighboring counties to benefit themselves at the expense of their neighbors was not without influence. For example, the materials needed by Shanghai citizens are all obtained from the surrounding countryside. When transportation is not smooth, reliance on the supply of the affiliated counties must be heavy. The county administration facilities of these counties, each acting on their own, engaging in corruption and extortion, and increasing commodity prices, directly affect Shanghai's municipal administration and the stability of people's livelihood. At the same time, it is also necessary to adjust the county administration of the seven counties under the city's jurisdiction, stabilize people's livelihood, and strive to increase production. This is the second point.

The issue of public security is as important as the stability of people's livelihood. Shanghai's public security is threatened by bandits and fugitives who use the counties with relatively complete police and Baojia (self-policing) organizations as nests to spy on Shanghai and seize opportunities to act. Therefore, to establish Shanghai's public security, we cannot only focus on Shanghai itself, but must also establish the public security of neighboring counties. In that case, it is bound to adjust the county administration of the seven counties under the city's jurisdiction. This is the third point.

Based on the above three points, we feel that the urban area of Shanghai is very important, and the surrounding counties are also very important. It is necessary to start adjusting them at the same time as Shanghai's municipal administration. Otherwise, it will not be perfect. As for how to adjust, we feel that we should start from three aspects: personnel, finance, and public security.

In terms of personnel adjustment, the first thing to do is to replace officials who aim to "get rich." Those with bad records should not only be replaced, but also be punished according to the severity of the circumstances. Generally, officials who are law-abiding, fair, and upright, even if their abilities are slightly lacking, should be rewarded to cultivate a clean and honest atmosphere in the officialdom. This is what is meant by punishing the past to prevent future mistakes. Secondly, the principle of establishing expert politics should be followed. It is impossible for those in power to establish good political achievements with the mentality of "five days as the mayor of the capital." The upper-level leaders should be able to bury themselves in hard work and lead by example, hoping that the middle and lower-level leaders can do things in the spirit of hard work, practical work, and tough work, without perfunctoriness, without following old habits, without being content with the status quo, without complaining about hard work, and without being bureaucratic. The first thing is to make them feel secure in their positions and willing to bury themselves in hard work. In this way, they can give full play to their expertise, and at the same time, it is possible to cultivate non-specialists into good experts. If personnel can be managed according to this policy, there is no need to worry about not being able to establish honest politics.

The financial adjustment is to block all loopholes for corruption, unify tax collection, eliminate embezzlement, increase county revenue, establish an independent accounting system, unify revenue and expenditure, eliminate clever tricks and establish new items, and eliminate harsh taxes and extortion that disturb people's livelihood. On the other hand, with the life of county officials guaranteed, they will not dare to do evil and violate the law. Once the surrounding county administration is clean and clear, the more political will become clean and clear. With a sound adjustment in personnel and finance, the adjustment in public security will also be easier to start. The most important thing is to ensure the safety of county residents and have the power to suppress bandits and disturbances, becoming a barrier to the urban area. How can this be achieved? At a minimum, the military salary and allowance for maintaining public security must be sufficient, and extortion and disturbance of the people must be strictly prohibited. At the same time, strict training should be given, so that in case of an event, everyone can bravely obey orders and will not turn into a master of disturbing the people and wasting resources.

### British and American Soldiers Shoot Chongqing Volunteer Soldiers

(Central News Agency Shanghai News) According to reliable sources: The Chongqing Military Commission organized volunteer soldiers last year to be sent to Burma, India and other places to be incorporated into the British and American troops, serving as liaison and translation work. It is found that these volunteer soldiers are all drawn from universities. Any university student who serves in the army for one semester (ie, half a year) is counted as one academic year (one year) of credits. All graduating seniors are required to serve in the army for half a year before they can receive a diploma. Therefore, the total number of volunteer soldiers drawn last year was 15,000. Recently, these volunteer soldiers, because they could not bear the oppression of the British and American soldiers, often expressed non-cooperation in their actions and speeches, and the British and American soldiers secretly took resolute and despicable measures to shoot them and destroy their bodies. In the past month or two, Chongqing has heard about this, but it has not been able to fully understand the details. By the beginning of December last year, the case of shooting volunteer soldiers had become an open secret, and even the British and American personnel responsible in Chongqing had issued distorted semi-admissions. The people of Chongqing were excited, especially the young students.

### Mayor Zhou is Scheduled to Summon Economic and Financial Officials Today to Inquire About Relevant Administrative Policies and Give Instructions

Mayor Zhou of this city is scheduled to convene senior officials from the Economic Bureau and the Finance Bureau today to give instructions, to inquire about relevant administrative policies and give instructions. On the Economic Bureau side, Director Xu Jiang will lead the team to see and listen to the instructions. On the Finance Bureau side, in addition to the concurrent Director Luo, Advisor Watanabe, Counselor Funatsu, Chief Secretary Xu Songping, and Municipal Government Secretary Liu Mingji will all be present.

Concurrent Director Luo Rectifies Tax Revenue

Since Luo Junqiang, the concurrent Director of the Shanghai Municipal Finance Bureau, took office, except for a portion who resigned voluntarily, the staff of each section has not changed, in order to be familiar with the work. He is now actively rectifying the finances, and is determined to take the principle of unified revenue and expenditure to achieve a balance between revenue and expenditure. It is because he is aware that although the various tax revenues in the past are said to be not small, the expenditures are huge. The difference between tax revenue and expenditure is as high as 60%. Inevitably, the tax collectors are not effective, or unscrupulous merchants induce on-the-job civil servants to accept bribes and dereliction of duty, attempting to embezzle or evade taxes. This situation has a significant impact on the national treasury revenue, so he is determined to rectify various taxes with a policy of integrity, urging subordinates to vigorously urge collection, and all proceeds will be turned over to the public. Not only will the proper tax sources be determined, but also efforts will be made to reduce expenditure to achieve the goal of balancing revenue and expenditure.

Determined to Solve the Price Problem

Since Mayor Zhou and Secretary-General Luo took office, the price problem in this city has gradually shown a downward trend, which is indeed fortunate for all the citizens of the city. The price problem, although closely related to the smooth flow of material sources, is in fact the greatest cause of high prices caused by various man-made facts. The authorities have now decided to eliminate illegal extortion, and the transfer of materials into the urban area will naturally be smooth in the future. It is hoped that the authorities will further thoroughly clarify the man-made causes of soaring prices, such as speculation, hoarding, and manipulation, and decisively take strict measures, so that the price problem can be resolved and the general people's livelihood can be stabilized.

### Allied Forces Authorities Answered Visit to Mayor Zhou

The Allied Japan's army and navy authorities in Shanghai visited the municipal government from 10:30 to 11:00 am on the 22nd to thank the concurrent Mayor Zhou, Secretary-General Luo, and the directors of each bureau and office for their visit after taking office.

### Chongqing and Communists Have Different Opinions, American and Other Enemies Take the Opportunity to Enter, Minister Matsudaira Makes a Speech

The Shanghai Office of the Allied Japanese Embassy held a routine press conference yesterday afternoon. Minister Matsudaira made the following remarks: Recently, the US Wartime Information Bureau published a report on the Chongqing regime. The full text is quite lengthy. The main points can be divided into three chapters: (1) the political and anti-Japanese situation in Chongqing, (2) the process of negotiations between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party and issues concerning various parties and factions, and (3) the economic situation in Chongqing and the situation of US assistance. Among them, the second chapter on the negotiation process between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party was not to be published by the Chongqing side, so it is especially interesting. It is said that there are three differences of opinion between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party: (1) Chongqing allows the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region government all political powers except the currency issuing power, but the area required by the Yan'an side must also include North China in addition to the Border Region. (2) Chongqing promises to give all parties and factions equal status after the implementation of constitutional government, while the Communist Party requires immediate implementation of constitutional government and participation in the coalition government. (3) Chongqing has internally decided that the ten divisions of the Communist army will be under the command of the Military Commission and will be treated the same as the National Army. The Communist Party requires the expansion of sixteen divisions. There are other parts that Chongqing has not published, but why is the US Intelligence Bureau exposing everything? Its intention is quite noteworthy. In short, this move is not without a meaning of praise and encouragement to Chongqing, and at the same time, it urges Chongqing to reflect, so as to learn from the American style of democracy, so that the activities of the United States in Chongqing will be more convenient.
