We wish to appropriately apply these measures and make special efforts to implement all policies related to fighting to the end, in order to live up to your trust."

### Fierce Battles Unfold in Shimajiri and Oroku Areas; Japanese Army Minister Cables Thanks to Officials and Civilians on Okinawa Island

Ryukyu Base, 12th (Central News Agency) – Regarding the land battles on Okinawa Island, the Japanese forces defending the southernmost Shimajiri district of the island, which is their main new position, are engaged in fierce battles with the approaching enemy forces. At the same time, the situation in the Oroku area is also quite urgent. The enemy forces in front of the main Japanese positions in the Shimajiri area have concentrated forces of 500 to 1,000 men each in the western, central, and eastern districts since the 8th. They have also landed new forces in the Minatogawa area in preparation for launching an offensive. Since the 11th, they have launched a general attack on the Japanese-held area. The Japanese defending forces have either ambushed the superior enemy forces with concentrated artillery fire or engaged in suicidal charges, inflicting heavy damage on the enemy. On the east coast, Gushichan has finally fallen into enemy hands. In the Yaese-dake and Yoza-dake areas, the two armies are only a short distance apart, engaging in close combat, and the battle is raging fiercely. The enemy offensive in the Oroku area is also quite intense. Under the cover of air units, they are gradually infiltrating the Japanese positions. On the 11th, the enemy forces approached the main Japanese positions and began fighting.

Tokyo, 13th (Central News Agency) – Japanese Army Minister Anami issued a heartfelt telegram of gratitude and encouragement to Governor Shimada of Okinawa Prefecture and all the prefecture's residents on the 12th. This was because, since the enemy landed on the Kerama Islands on March 25th and invaded Okinawa, the residents of Okinawa Prefecture have cooperated with the soldiers as one to fight and annihilate the American enemy, and they are still fighting in a difficult battle situation. Their utmost sincerity and loyalty are deeply appreciated. The contents of the telegram are as follows: "Since the landing of the enemy, the governor and all the residents of the prefecture have exerted all their strength to cooperate with the military, demonstrating utmost sincerity and loyalty, and fighting to annihilate the enemy forces. We are deeply grateful and express our deepest thanks."

Central News Agency Report – Vice Admiral Mitscher, commander of the U.S. 58th Task Force, has returned home for a month's leave. During an interview with a group of reporters on the 11th, he stated that the closer we get to the Japanese mainland, the stronger the Japanese resistance becomes. The Okinawa operation is a perfect example of this. Bombing alone cannot win the Pacific War. To defeat Japan, we must have more infantry assistance in the future. General Stilwell, Chief of the U.S. Ground Forces, has stated that there will be even more brutal land battles on Okinawa. Mitscher's words also express agreement with this.

### Major Fujii and Others Promoted and Decorated

Tokyo, 13th (Central News Agency) – Fourteen air force martyrs, including Major Fujii, who died valiantly in the southwestern islands near Tokyo and in the South Seas, have previously been awarded citations and reported to the Emperor. Today, the Japanese Army Ministry announced that His Majesty the Emperor has also bestowed upon each of them the special grace of promotion. Also, Petty Officer Morisawa and others who died in the southwestern islands were also awarded honors.

### Lieutenant Kuroshima and Others Commended for Distinguished Service

Tokyo, 13th (Central News Agency) – The Japanese Navy Ministry recently announced that Lieutenant Kuroshima Shiro of the Yokosuka Naval Air Corps and Petty Officer 1st Class Kuramoto Juso have shot down six and damaged two B-29 enemy aircraft during the interception battles against enemy aircraft that have been attacking the Japanese mainland since last winter. Furthermore, on the night of the 5th and 25th of this month, when a large enemy formation attacked, they used a "Gekko" aircraft to single-handedly break into the enemy formation, achieving the glorious results of shooting down five aircraft and damaging one. They were specially commended for their distinguished service by the commander of the Totsuka-Yokosuka Naval Base, who issued a notice to the entire army.

### Japanese Fighter Planes Excellent

Stockholm, 13th (Central News Agency) – The Swedish newspaper, Svenska Dagbladet, published the following about the new Japanese aircraft on June 5th: Major Strömlin, who led the carrier aircraft that attacked the Kyushu region of Japan on the 4th of this month, said on the deck of his flagship in the waters off Okinawa: "The speed of the Japanese fighter planes that met us was extremely fast, and our aircraft could not hope to match it. The Japanese planes had resolved to engage us." Other chief officers also said in unison: "Japanese fighter planes are several times better than the aircraft we are flying."

### Actual Situation of the Japanese Military's Operation to Recapture Mäll Airport

Southern Frontline Base, 13th (Central News Agency) – The enemy is suffering from headaches due to the difficulty of supplying the Pacific front lines. Moreover, the supply lines from the United States to Okinawa through the Philippines, Solomon Islands, New Guinea, and Mariana Islands are also being constrained by the active Japanese forces, causing great obstacles to the rear. The Japanese military's operation to recapture Mäll Airport, which began in late April, has achieved the expected results, causing a corner of the enemy's New Guinea air base to collapse. The commander of the Japanese forces engaged in this operation, along with his unit commander, returned yesterday and described the actual situation of the operation as follows: New Guinea is connected by dense jungle areas, meandering mud rivers, and unscalable rocks, and the humidity is very high. In this natural obstacle, food is still insufficient. However, the morale of the Japanese soldiers is extraordinarily high, and they have completely occupied Mäll Airport. In late April, after our army units planned the operation on the north coast of New Guinea, they set out from the camp with enthusiasm. Each army carried bullets and food for forty days, continuing the difficult march for about forty days, and then reached Mäll Airport. At that time, the faces of the soldiers were covered in black due to the sweat and dust, and they were almost indistinguishable from the local residents. We then began the attack with a suicide tactic. The enemy forces did not resist due to the fierce attacks of our infiltrating commando and hand-to-hand combat teams, and they all retreated. Our army is currently carrying out a mopping-up operation in the vicinity.

### On the Issue of Increasing Food Production in Jiangsu Province

— Chen Yaoxi

Introduction

Our China has been established as an agricultural nation for more than four thousand years, and the supply and demand of food should be self-sufficient. However, due to the lack of promotion, the lack of efforts to change dietary habits, and the lack of sound control, the agricultural society has gradually collapsed, and the rural economy has become increasingly depleted. The food of a great agricultural country must instead be supplied from overseas. Therefore, the average annual import of food from overseas reaches more than 300 million yuan, a complete loss of rights and interests, which is truly heartbreaking and alarming.

The import of food from overseas has now been cut off, and the food supply is gradually becoming scarce. Taking rice as an example, the price per stone has reached one million yuan, compared with about seven yuan for coarse rice and about eight yuan for white rice in 1936, which is more than 100,000 times more expensive. Although the price of everything has risen in recent years, the index is not as large as that of rice. Therefore, the rise in food prices is actually above any other essential commodity. In view of this, the national government has listed "increasing production" as one of the three major policies in order to fundamentally solve the food problem.

Jiangsu Province is the main rice-producing area in central China. Its average annual rice production accounts for more than 11% of the total national rice production, especially in the area south of the Yangtze River in Yangzhou, where the Yangtze River and Lake Taihu crisscross, with dense irrigation canals, a mild climate, and fertile soil, which is known as the "land of fish and rice." In terms of the national government's material supply, it accounts for a very large proportion. Increasing agricultural production in the Jiangnan area has also been listed as one of the key points of the Jiangsu provincial government's administration in the future. Therefore, the issue of increasing food production in Jiangsu Province must be urgently reviewed. However, although there are many current production increase plans, such as dredging transportation, abolishing taxes, implementing rationing, and cracking down on hoarding, all of these passive palliative methods are unlikely to be truly effective and lasting. Therefore, I have ventured to write this article, hoping that scholars at home will not hesitate to enlighten me.

Status of Food Production in Jiangsu Province

Past and Present

According to statistics, Jiangsu Province had 33.6 million mu of paddy fields before the Incident, with an annual rice production of about 82.5 million shi, an average of 2.45 shi of rice per mu. After the Incident, although the Construction Department strictly ordered each county to report the cultivated area and yield of important crops every year, the technical personnel in each county were lacking and the economy was not sufficient, so the figures obtained could not be fully utilized. How is the food production situation in the counties of Jiangnan? There is no way to do anything other than roughly estimate it. Although Jiangnan and Jiangbei in Jiangsu Province are separated by only one river, the natural environment, soil quality, water conservancy, farming situation, and rural economy are very different. In terms of the actual situation of agriculture, the paddy field area in the 21 counties of Jiangnan accounts for at least one-half of the total paddy field area of the province, that is, more than 15 million mu. Now, the following methods are used to make a rough estimate of rice production in the counties of Jiangnan.

According to the number of tax-assessed fields in each county in the statistics of the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Finance in 1943, it is used as the total arable land area of each county. Although the numbers in this statistic contain some non-productive land areas such as residential land, wasteland, and tombs, each county generally reports more than the actual number of tax-assessed fields due to psychological factors, so the accuracy of the statistics is still close to the facts.

Hunan Province is the richest rice-producing area in China, and the counties of Jiangnan in Jiangsu can also be compared with it, and some counties even exceed it. According to the estimate of Mr. Zhang Xinyi of the Statistics Office of the Legislative Yuan, the paddy field area in Hunan Province accounts for about 66% of the total arable land area, so it is assumed that the average percentage of paddy field area in the counties of Jiangnan is 70%.

According to 1. The Shanghai Bank Commodity Investigation Bulletin No. 1 "Rice" estimates that the average rice production per mu in Jiangsu Province is 2.07 shi. 2. The above-mentioned average rice production per mu is 2.45 shi. It is assumed that the average rice production per mu is 2.25 shi.

The table shows the rice production of 21 counties in Jiangnan, Jiangsu Province.

Wu County, Yixing, Taicang. Liyang, Jinshan, Wuxi, Changshu, Gaochun, Jiangyin, Jiangning, Yangzhou, Wujiang, Wutong, Jurong, Kunshan, Songjiang, Zhenjiang, Qingpu, Danyang, Jinshan, Shenshui has 15.3 million mu of paddy fields with an annual rice production of 34.4 million shi. After the Incident, due to the impact of the war on rural areas and the disturbance of bandits, the agricultural production capacity of Jiangsu Province declined sharply. Item name 1936 yield (thousand dan) Rice 1,023.202 Wheat 463.353 Millet 135.487 Sorghum 153.809 Check before 1936, the war only affected the Beijing-Shanghai area of North China and Central China, and the counties of Jiangnan were the main rice-producing area in this area, and the rate of decline in rice production accounted for the first place among all food, which shows the severity of the war's impact on rural areas in Jiangnan. If the estimated rice production in the counties of Jiangnan is converted according to the rate of decline in production, then the actual rice production in Jiangnan is only 27.9 million shi. Assuming that men eat 8 he of rice per day and women eat 6 he of rice per day, the average is reduced to 7 he per person per day, and we cannot obtain the rate of this number. However, in 1939, the Agricultural Bank of China made a comparison of the harvest of various important food crops in 1936 (pre-war) and 1938 (post-war), as shown in the following table: 1938 yield (thousand dan) percentage 82.232 81% 206.483 45% 59.101 58% 26.441 20% 36.170 23% calculated, then each person needs to eat about 2.5 shi of rice per year, and 27.9 million shi of rice can supply the food for more than 11 million people for one year. According to the situation that people are massively concentrated in the Jiangnan area after the war, the population of the 21 counties of Jiangnan is definitely not this number. Although not all people rely on rice as their main food, the insufficient distribution of rice is undoubtedly indisputable. Therefore, the urgent need to restore the productivity of rural areas in Jiangnan should be regarded as a major undertaking of the Jiangsu provincial government in the future, and it is urgent and cannot be delayed.

Editorial

### Rapidly Resolve the Food Crisis

Recently, due to the uncontrolled soaring of rice prices, general commodity prices have also followed suit, spreading like wildfire and without end. The general public, especially salaried workers and common citizens, are feeling the heavy pressure of life and experiencing great panic. We believe that under such a severe situation, emergency countermeasures must be decided and implemented quickly. The content of the emergency countermeasures must be practical, easy to implement, and have quick results.

Under the current severe circumstances, it is undeniable that we must gather all our strength and contribute to the single goal of winning victory, from any point of view. The current rice and food crisis, and even the price crisis, are sufficient to threaten people's livelihood and affect the gathering of all our strength. Therefore, we absolutely cannot allow this problem to run its course or continue to delay, and we should quickly develop rescue measures that address the crux of the problem.

On the other hand, we hope that the people will not panic excessively about the soaring rice prices, because this soaring of rice prices is ultimately unreasonable. As long as we quickly develop emergency countermeasures and address the root cause, we can at least curb the unreasonable soaring. At the same time, in a passive way, everyone should immediately change the notion that they cannot survive without rice, and adopt miscellaneous grains for subsistence in order to reduce the degree of panic over rice and food.

Most miscellaneous grains are not subject to control, and procurement and transportation are free. Also, the amount of miscellaneous grains that have already been transported to Shanghai from various places is not small. From an objective standpoint, miscellaneous grain prices do not have a consistent linkage effect with rice prices. However, the current miscellaneous grain prices have soared in proportion to rice prices. Our research shows that the crux of this lies in letting it go unchecked. Therefore, the simultaneous soaring of miscellaneous grain prices is a phenomenon of anarchy. We hope that the authorities will quickly suppress miscellaneous grain prices and procure a steady supply from production areas such as Huaihai as soon as possible.

In addition, we have always believed that the rice and grain purchasing method needs to be changed. If we do not make fundamental and reasonable reforms, the food problem will only become more complicated and difficult to improve. It is an inevitable and unquestionable principle to adopt a controlled economy in wartime. The improvement we advocate is not a change in the principle of the controlled policy, but a transformation of the control technology. Because the purchasing method has not been fully adapted to the national and public sentiment, it has increased the severity of the rice and grain problem. Feeling the lessons of this repeated experience, we further advocate that we must quickly improve the control technology. Once the control technology is improved, the people will naturally place new expectations on the resolution of the food problem, thereby alleviating the sense of panic.

Speaking of improving control technology, we naturally hope that the national government will take responsibility and consider the entire plan. At the same time, we hope that the allied authorities will do their utmost to assist in promoting the realization of the plan. Only when the Chinese and Japanese authorities embrace the heart of considering others hunger as their own hunger, and regarding the drowning of others as their own drowning, can they work together to implement the plan and achieve effective improvements.

We have said before: "As long as the strength of the Chinese authorities, the strength of the Allied authorities stationed in China, and the strength of popular leadership are united, then all difficulties can be overcome." Today, to quickly suppress rice prices and regulate food, we can only hope that these three forces are united and do their utmost.

### Chongqing's Poor New Recruits

Nanjing, 13th (Central News Agency) – According to Chongqing telegrams: Lu Zhonglin, Minister of the Military Service Department of Chongqing, recently flew to Yunnan, Sichuan, Hunan, and other places to inspect the actual situation of military service. He has now returned to Chongqing on the 9th. Lu expressed dissatisfaction with the recruitment of new recruits in various places. After arriving in Chongqing, he made the following statement to reporters: The recruitment of soldiers in Yunnan Province is better, but many of the new recruits are unqualified in physique. Some of the elderly, weak, and unqualified new recruits have been ordered to be given expenses and sent back to their hometowns, and the commanders of each district have been strictly ordered to impose strict warnings if the same situation occurs again in the future. The recruitment of soldiers in western Hunan has been poor due to the impact of the war, and a total of eight county magistrates have failed to handle the recruitment of soldiers in accordance with the law. The provincial government of Hunan is requested to give them appropriate punishment by telegram. Zeng Ding, the regiment leader of the Yuanshui Military Service District, fraudulently reported the number of personnel and falsely received military pay and has been dismissed from his post and punished according to law. In short, the physical fitness of the people has declined recently, and the heads of each unit are thinking about extracting money from the new recruits, which makes the soldiers even worse. In addition, the recruitment of the district and county heads only focuses on the quantity of recruits and does not pay attention to the quality of the new recruits. Each commander has been strictly ordered that there must be no more unqualified new recruits in the future, otherwise all expenses shall be the responsibility of the commander of each military service district.

### Pétain Under Preliminary Hearing in a Military Camp in Mons

Zurich, 13th (Central News Agency) - Marshal Pétain, former head of the Vichy government, remains imprisoned in the Yersen military camp on the outskirts of Paris. During the preliminary hearing at the military camp, Marshal Pétain stated that the policy of the Vichy government was one of "dual personality," and was actually intended to launch a resistance movement against Germany within France. The main points of his statement are as follows: My policy towards Germany was one of false pretense, and I collaborated with outstanding Allied generals such as Darlan and Weygand. I was also a member of the anti-German faction, but only conducted anti-German resistance within France. Furthermore, I opposed de Gaulle's individual, meaningless sacrifices within the country. I was deeply saddened by the German execution of hostages and even requested to be a hostage myself. I firmly believe that I have made great contributions to France. My appointment of Laval as head of the government was to conceal the truth from Germany, and as a result, the German side was also satisfied.

Lisbon, 13th (Central News Agency) - According to a report from British newspapers in Barcelona, former head of the Vichy government, Laval, is currently imprisoned on the old Lerich Mountain, closely monitoring the trial of Marshal Pétain, and can only wait to see what Pétain's fate will be before deciding his own course of action.

### Impressions of Eastern Zhejiang (III)

— Yifei

By the Cao'e River

Due to difficulties with transportation, I stayed in Shaoxing for five days and only left on May 19th for Ningbo. At 7:00 AM that morning, amidst the misty rain, I headed to the bus station to wait for a ticket. The bus was scheduled to depart at 9:30 AM, but because it took time to heat the charcoal and there were concerns about breakdowns en route, the bus was tested again and again before departure. It finally departed at 10:15 AM in pouring rain. The road was extremely bumpy, and the bus body swayed significantly, especially when crossing bridges, due to the heavy rain. The entire route was dominated by continuous mountains. Thirty li away from Cao'e River is "Changliu Village," where the "Changshan" mountain has red soil, contrasting with the forests on the mountain, creating an interesting and characteristic landscape.

At 12:45 PM, the bus arrived at the Cao'e River. After getting off the bus, I took a small boat operated by the Baiguan Ferry Bureau to cross the river. The river was about 30 to 40 zhang wide. There were three huge bridge piers in the river, standing proudly. According to the boatmen, these bridge piers were intended to support a railway bridge before the war, allowing direct access for Shanghai-Hangzhou railway passenger cars to Ningbo. However, the bridge piers were only just laid before the war broke out, and the project was suspended.

After about five minutes, I arrived on the opposite bank. The muddy shore was about a zhang away from the water's edge. The reporter was carried ashore on someone's back and climbed to the Baiguan Inspection Post. After undergoing a routine inspection, I arrived at the parking lot, which was a square carved out of a mountain. There were barracks on the mountaintop, which was about 30 zhang high, forming a strategically important location.

閒詁百官 (A Leisurely Chat About Baiguan)

It is said that Baiguan is a town in Shangyu County, Zhejiang Province, with a population of about 20,000. Most residents make a living by farming and fishing. During non-farming seasons, rural women also engage in temporary side occupations such as weaving straw sandals and hats. Tangpu and Zhangjiapu, 60 li away from Baiguan, and "Shangpu," 30 li away, produce silk and tea. Farmers often transport these local products to distant places to sell for profit during their free time.

Recently, due to unrest in the surrounding villages, Shangyu County and other affiliated organizations have relocated here, resulting in a sudden influx of military doctors and government officials. The only street in the area is narrow and desolate, with a completely rural atmosphere. The main produce is wheat, soybeans, and corn. Prices are cheaper than in Shaoxing. When the reporter arrived, the prices were as follows: rice was 140,000 yuan per dan (second-grade rice was 135,000 yuan), pork was 1,760 yuan per jin, chicken was 1,600 yuan per jin, cooking oil was 2,400 yuan per jin, soft firewood was 12 yuan per jin, and hardwood was 15 yuan.

民生一斑 (Glimpse of People's Livelihoods)

The reporter went to the parking lot early the next morning to inquire about bus information. I witnessed many farmers and children carrying rice bags, crowding near the inspection post, looking anxious and hoping to cross the river. Curious, I asked them and learned that they were residents from the Cao'e Temple area across the river. Because rice is not produced locally, its price (160,000 yuan) is more expensive than in Baiguan. They came to the town to buy rice to cook, but were blocked at the inspection post and not allowed to pass. Then, the reporter asked about their daily lives. According to them, the harvest in the villages around Cao'e has been poor in recent years, so in addition to managing household affairs, they must also work hard to help their families cultivate the fields, hoping to increase crop yields. Because the early wheat (i.e., barley) has not yet been harvested, they are experiencing a difficult period. Most of them only have one proper meal a day, and the rest of the time they subsist on barley gruel. Their difficult lives are evident.

### News Association Holds Tea Party Yesterday to Welcome Minister Kuwabara, Encouraging Mutual Unity to Overcome Difficulties

The Shanghai branch of the China News Association, to welcome the newly appointed Minister Kuwabara of the Japanese Fleet Press Department in China, specially held a tea party yesterday (the 13th) afternoon at the Hua Mou Hotel. Minister Kuwabara arrived on time with Captain Matsumoto and others, and were received by Chen Binhe, Chairman of the Shanghai branch of the China News Association, and others. More than a hundred people from various newspapers attended, including Tozaka Yuichi, Moriyama Takashi, Chen Riping, Xu Liqun, Jin Xiongbo, Lu Guangjie, Ni Diesun, Weng Yongqing, Lu Feng, Yang Huilang, and Zheng Jie. Chen Binhe first delivered a welcoming speech, followed by Minister Kuwabara's reply, where he expressed his aspirations. The host and guests were enthusiastic, and the party ended around 4:00 PM. Today, the Shanghai branch of the China News Association held a tea party to welcome Minister Kuwabara of the Fleet Press Department. We are very pleased by your presence. Minister Kuwabara has served in China for many years and is familiar with the situation in China, with many Chinese friends. In the past, he worked hard to promote Sino-Japanese cooperation. We have known Minister Kuwabara for a long time, and our friendship has always been profound. We are especially pleased that the relationship with the press community will become even closer in the future. Currently, the situation is becoming increasingly tense, and the responsibility of the press community is also becoming increasingly important. However, I firmly believe that if the governments of China and Japan, together with the people of both countries, unite as one, then all difficulties can be overcome.

In terms of objectives and direction of propaganda and reporting work, the first requirement is unification. Only with firm belief and consistent steps can strength be generated. Currently, the spirit of unity among our Shanghai press colleagues is unprecedented since before the incident, and the attitude of cooperation is also unprecedented. Secondly, the cooperation between the press community and reporting agencies is also extremely close, and these are all excellent phenomena. Now, we are even more fortunate to have Mr. Kuwabara, an old friend who is familiar with the situation in China, to take up the post of Minister of the Fleet Press Department, providing us with guidance and assistance. We firmly believe that in the future, our propaganda work will be more consistent and more closely collaborative.

Minister Kuwabara's reply Minister Kuwabara, Minister of the Fleet Press Department, delivered his reply, stating briefly: Mr. Matsushima has been honorably transferred, and I am temporarily taking over his duties. I am deeply grateful to the News Association for holding this tea party today and for Chairman Chen's many compliments. As Chairman Chen said, I have served in China for a relatively long time, but even though the time is long, I cannot claim to be completely familiar and clear about everything in China. During my time in China, I have made many Chinese friends, and we often express the phrase "Sino-Japanese Friendship" in our conversations. I have made great efforts regarding the issue of Sino-Japanese friendship, but the development of this issue has been the opposite of what was expected. There are certainly various reasons for this, but one of the reasons is that Chinese and Japanese people have not fully understood their counterparts. In order for the two countries to thoroughly understand each other, the intellectual community must rise up to guide and struggle. All of you present today are authorities in the intellectual community. It is my sincere hope that through your efforts, the Chinese and Japanese nations can thoroughly recognize and understand each other. Since I am now also in charge of reporting duties, my personal aspirations are also based on this goal, and I will strive to achieve it. I hope that you will not hesitate to teach me. The current situation has reached a critical stage, and I hope that we can unite as one to achieve this goal.

### Economic Police Authorities Strictly Investigate Hoarding, Yong'an Company Confiscated Soap and Cloth

Recently, the city's prices have risen dramatically, and public security and people's livelihood have been greatly threatened. The economic authorities have repeatedly discussed appropriate measures with various relevant authorities to crack down on the situation. At the same time, the city police economic authorities are still strictly investigating a large number of unscrupulous merchants and stores hoarding and exceeding price limits. It is reported that the Economic Police Brigade, based on a tip-off, discovered that Yong'an Company on Nanjing Road disregarded the law and hoarded a large number of daily necessities such as soap and various cloths, which was illegal. Therefore, the police were dispatched to the company a few days ago, and more than 1,000 boxes of soap and more than 40 bundles of cloth (40 pieces per bundle) were seized in the false walls on the second and third floors. The hoarding was investigated on the spot. The company's secret hiding place for soap and cloth was obviously unwilling to sell the products to the public and attempted to hoard for profit. The economic regulations will be confiscated and punished, and this kind of illegal act should be severely punished as a warning to others.

Confiscated edible oil sold at parity prices. In addition: the economic police brigade of the Fourth Division of the Municipal Police Bureau recently discovered that an oil merchant hoarded more than 50 dan of edible oil and refused to sell it to the public. The oil merchant was summoned to the bureau for questioning. In order to maintain the people's livelihood, they were ordered to hand over the goods and were sold at a reasonable price of 4,000 yuan per catty. It has been distributed at the same time by five teams from the afternoon of yesterday. Each city catty is priced at 4,000 yuan, and each person is limited to buy half a catty for universality. It is reported that if merchants are found hoarding in the future, the same measures will be taken to limit them to public sales.

### Shanghai Military License Plates Limited to Military Personnel

The white egg-shaped military vehicle license plates in Shanghai were originally special vehicle license plates for use by the defense forces of the city. From November of the 31st year to May of this year, the former Public Works Bureau and the Construction Bureau successively issued a considerable number of Shanghai military license plates.
