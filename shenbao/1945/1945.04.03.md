### The Phantasmagorical San Francisco Conference

—Kishi Iichi, Information Minister of the Japanese Embassy

The Crimean Conference

The recently held Crimean Conference declared that the anti-Axis powers would convene the San Francisco Conference on April 25th. The Crimean Conference decided on a plan by the UK, US, and Soviet Union to dispose of Germany, presumptuously believing that a military solution could fundamentally resolve Germany's entire political and social problems. We are taken aback by this anachronistic decision. Yet, they continue to err without extracting themselves, deciding that April 25th would be the day to discuss the reconstruction of a world peace organization.

The UK and US have chosen April 25th, the date on which the Soviet-Japanese Neutrality Pact, a treaty of extreme importance in maintaining peace in the Far East, could be declared for abrogation with one year's notice, as a rare opportunity. They persuaded the Soviet Union to accept convening the conference on that day, which reveals the ingenuity of the UK and US in their intentions and means. By choosing this date, they could create the impression that the UK, US, and Soviet Union had no conflicting views on general East Asian issues. At the same time, they could make the Japanese people feel that the Soviet Union's acceptance of holding talks on this day meant that the Soviet-Japanese Neutrality Pact would probably not be extended. They would thus seek to sow discord between the friendly Japanese and Soviet relations, and use this situation to seek Japan's unconditional surrender. This is why they deliberately announced the date of the conference in advance.

They have also exaggerated the importance of the conference in various ways. First, they have exaggerated the number of participating countries to be over forty, to show the large scope of the conference. We do not remember the exact number, nor do we feel it is necessary. Most of the countries are merely following the lead of the sides in the war, just a motley crowd. No matter how many countries participate, the UK, US, and Soviet Union promote its universality, but the real power to control the conference lies with the United States alone.

Secondly, there is the issue of France and the Chongqing regime's attendance. It is rumored that Torgol has refused to attend the conference because he was not invited to the Crimean Conference, which is a matter of distress for the UK and US. The United States, which claims to be the father of the Four Freedoms, has indicated the need to interfere with Torgol's freedom of speech, but Torgol will eventually be forced to attend. Torgol is, after all, a bastard of the UK and US, and can only survive in this way. Forcing France to participate in the conference will show off their triumphant scene.

As for the Chongqing regime, it immediately accepted the principles of the Crimean Conference and expressed its willingness to participate in the conference. This shows that when East Asian issues are discussed at this conference, only Chongqing, which is isolated in one corner of China, will participate. To put it more clearly, only Chongqing, which has the characteristics of the UK and US, will participate and express its opinions. Most of the other East Asian countries and peoples, who are most eager to obtain freedom, are excluded from the door. Although the issues discussed at this conference have universality, the ingredients that constitute the participants are not complete. It is said that this is based on the so-called principles of democracy, but it has exposed the lack of a quorum. Furthermore, discussing the inherent problems of East Asia, which establishes the foundation of East Asia, on the other side of the Pacific Ocean is not what the billion people of Asia want to hear. Handling East Asian issues without the will of the billion people of Asia is nothing more than the expression of the UK and US's ambition to dominate the world.

Third, it is said that this conference will inherit the "Dumbarton Oaks" conference and engage in drafting the final draft of the world peace organization. More on this later.

The Function and Composition of the United Nations

The world peace organization organized by the UK, US, and Soviet Union is called the "United Nations," and consists of the General Assembly, the Security Council Secretariat, and the International Court of Justice. This was stipulated at the "Dumbarton Oaks I Conference." Among these institutions, the most important and most powerful highest organ is the Security Council.

The Security Council consists of five permanent member states and six non-permanent member states. The five permanent member states are the US, UK, Soviet Union, Chongqing, and the recently decided France. This replaces the position that the so-called major powers of the past, the UK and France, occupied in the League of Nations. In particular, France and Chongqing participate in the conference with the UK and US as so-called equal qualifications, but their characters do not possess the substance.

The character of the French government in exile is nothing more than a part of the UK and US worldview. Although the French people sincerely expect peace and their happiness and prosperity in the European continent, they have this inherent requirement. However, the government representing them can only continue to exist by relying on the military force of the UK and US. This fact only makes their government a unit that constitutes the most effective balance of power in the organization for the UK and US to maintain world peace in name. France is not allowed to have its own ideals, nor is it allowed to develop outside the UK and US institutions. Its existence is only for casting a vote in favor at the time of voting. Torgol's troubles lie in this.

As for the Chongqing regime, it is also regarded as one of the five major countries. However, it has too many problems of its own. The unification of China has not been completed. The Chinese people can never be represented by the Chongqing regime. The Chongqing regime, based on its comprador character, has failed to solve the Sino-Japanese problem that the Chinese people are eager for. It has also failed to realize the unification and revival of China. This has been pointed out by the Communist Party of China. The difference between a government in exile and a comprador government is that one abandons the country and the people and relies on the UK and US to preserve its own regime, and the other happens to leave the country, but has abandoned the people and colludes with the UK and US to maintain its own regime. The important boredom is no different from Torgol's, and is a symbol of a conscience tormented.

These countries have failed to stand on the same front as the UK, US, and Soviet Union to equally discuss East Asian issues, let alone strive for the happiness and prosperity of the billion people of East Asia, because their characters and ways of existence do not allow them to do so.

Therefore, the Security Council is nothing more than the three powers tenaciously holding the reins of power. By observing the intentions expressed by the three great powers and taking their direction of thought, we can grasp the essence of the so-called Security Council.

According to their plan, the Security Council will be the central and pivotal organ of the United Nations. The Council will discuss all issues concerning guaranteeing international security and maintaining peace after the war, and can implement it with military force as a background. The United Nations has a General Assembly. The General Assembly, like the League of Nations in the past, is composed of a security meeting of constituent member states. Its title is even smaller than that of the League of Nations, but it only assumes the task of a consultation agency.

That is, in the future world, which country is the aggressor, and what kind of military force will be launched against the aggressor are the most important issues, and are determined by the Council. In the past, the League of Nations, although with a democratic composition, had already revealed the essence of oligarchic domination by the UK and France and the maintenance of the status quo. The United Nations has further strengthened this oligarchic domination, loudly declaiming the so-called "democracy" as the only supreme war aim. In international relations, they have to fall into the contradiction of recognizing the tripartite system as an effective measure, and this is also the problem of mutual suspicion and disagreement between the three major countries, which is the problem of voting procedures.

Editorial

### Talking About the San Francisco Conference

The so-called San Francisco Conference has been scheduled to be held on the 25th of this month. The anti-Axis groups are now actively preparing for this day's grand debut. According to the US, the performance period may last for more than three months. On the eve of the conference, the enemy's propaganda and schemes are extremely active, so it is necessary for us to be in the midst of it and discern the truth.

The convocation of the San Francisco Conference was decided at the Crimean Conference from February 4th to 11th of this year. According to the communique issued afterwards, the central task of this conference was to complete the unfinished tasks of the Dumbarton Oaks Conference in September and October of last year, and to "establish a worldwide international organization for maintaining peace and security."

However, this is just a one-sided fantasy. In reality, when an international war is in progress, and when more than a billion people on Earth have no representatives sent to the conference, may we ask what the conference relies on to discuss the establishment of a "worldwide" international organization for maintaining peace and security? Even if there is a discussion and a conclusion, what effect can it have? However, the UK, US, and Soviet Union are not entirely unaware of these issues, yet they are solemnly preparing for this conference. What is the reason for this? It is very obvious that the reason why the UK and US are expanding their propaganda about the San Francisco Conference "establishing a worldwide international organization for maintaining peace and security" is that their real intention is just a strategic expression coordinated with the war aims. For example:

First, the current war is at the stage of decisive battle, which is the total decisive battle of all forces on both sides. The enemy US is using this conference, using the right to attend this "decision to establish a worldwide international organization for maintaining peace and security," on the one hand, to try to lure some countries outside the wavering anti-Axis camp to strengthen their own momentum, and on the other hand, to threaten these countries to break away from the Axis camp and weaken the other side's momentum.

Second, they are promoting the importance of how the San Francisco Conference will decide the future world order and destiny, and they have decided to hold it in the shortest possible period. This fully exposes the enemy's psychology of seeking peace among the people of various countries who are tired of the current war, in order to create a speculative movement to end the war among the Axis countries, pro-Axis countries, and neutral countries, thereby weakening the resistance of the Axis countries.

Third, as the Japanese Embassy's Information Minister Kishi pointed out in his article "The Phantasmagorical San Francisco Conference" (see today's newspaper), the opening date of the San Francisco Conference coincides with the same date on which the Soviet-Japanese Neutrality Treaty is notified to continue or not (the Soviet-Japanese Neutrality Treaty was established on April 25, 1941, with a validity period of five years, stipulating that if a renewal is required, notice must be given one year in advance). This again contains the UK and US's clever instigation of Soviet-Japanese relations and dissemination of international political rumors.

Understanding the enemy's US-UK's intentions allows us to understand the "true value" of the San Francisco Conference. At the same time, while the US-UK-Chongqing parties are cheering with excitement, the Soviet Union, one of the main initiators, is only sending a delegation led by the ambassador to the US, a group of people who are unknown in the international community. This indifferent performance can also corroborate our above assessment of this conference.

Therefore, we must not have a higher evaluation of the San Francisco Conference than the above. Standing in the position of participating in the war in China, we must follow the established national policy of the government, closely cooperate with the allied countries, and move towards the road of completing the war. We can only strengthen our belief and make the enemy's conspiracy impossible to achieve. Then, whether the San Francisco Conference is held or not, who attends, and what issues are discussed, can all be regarded as a fantastic play staged by the US on the east coast of the Pacific Ocean, which will absolutely not play any role in realistic international issues.

### Philippine Independence Not Yet the Time: US Secretary of the Interior's Remarks

Central News Agency - US Secretary of the Interior Ickes declared on the night of March 26: "The United States doubts that it can give the Philippines what it needs, but making the Philippines independent immediately would do more harm than good." According to the opinions of the Filipino expatriates here, Ickes' statement completely exposed the imperialistic ambitions of the United States. The illegal actions of Britain towards India during the First World War are sufficient to show the Anglo-Saxon colonial policy towards East Asia. The Chinese government and public also often discuss this. Since the beginning of this war, Britain and the United States, in view of the failure of the methods used during the last World War, have changed their style and proclaimed "supporting democracy" and "preventing aggression" to prevent the difficulties of small and weak countries. Even for the abolished extraterritoriality, it is nothing more than this method. For example, in the agreement between Britain and the United States in the previous year, the abolition of extraterritoriality would be withdrawn from the war. Ickes used the excuse that "the economy, people and government of the Philippines have suffered a major blow from the war" and believed that the time for independence was too early. Then, one can also say about the agreement to abolish extraterritoriality: "The economy, people and government of extraterritoriality have suffered a major blow from the war." It is not known when it can be realized. According to the San Francisco Conference, Ickes is not the only one in the United States who makes such remarks. The former Philippine High Prosecutor, McNutt, also made such remarks. From this point of view, the opinion that the time for Philippine independence is still early is very common in the United States. The means of the United States are exactly the same as the means used by Britain to deal with India during the last World War, which makes the Filipinos express their anger.

### Yesterday's Enemy Air Raid on Shanghai; Four Aircraft Crashed; Strafing Civilians Killed and Injured More Than a Dozen People

Yesterday (2nd) morning, about 20 P-51 enemy aircraft came to Shanghai twice. After being intercepted by the Japanese army, four were shot down and four were destroyed. The enemy aircraft did nothing and flew away. The Shanghai Japanese Army and Navy Press Department issued the following statement on the same day:

At about 10:20 on April 2nd for about 20 minutes, more than a dozen enemy P-51 fighters invaded the Shanghai area. The Japanese army's interception unit shot down four of them and severely damaged four others, driving them back. Our side suffered extremely minor damage.

At 11:20, five P-51s approached the Shanghai area and also left without taking any action.

Enemy Aircraft Strafe Innocent Civilians

The enemy troops who raided the area in the morning descended to a low altitude of 20 meters above the ground and fired at 〇〇, but hardly damaged the book. One of the teams in the southwest of Shanghai actually strafed the houses of Chenjiaqiao Town and Panjialang, killing and injuring a dozen Chinese people. At that time, the enemy aircraft were only 15 meters above the ground. When the old and young residents fled hand in hand, the enemy clearly knew that they were Chinese civilians who were not combatants, but still strafed them. Their inhumane behavior was outrageous. After being intercepted by the Japanese army, one of them was hit and dropped the windshield glass and auxiliary twisted oil cans in order to get away, but it finally crashed on the bank of the Suzhou River. The nearby people witnessed this scene and applauded happily. Three other aircraft were also shot down, four were destroyed, and the rest fled in panic.

### Central Reserve Bank Handles Short-Term Lending to the Money Industry

The Shanghai branch of the Central Reserve Bank originally excluded the money industry from handling short-term lending to financial institutions.

### Production and Education: Two Priorities of Jiangsu Provincial Government: Interview with Governor Ren Yuandao

— Yi Tang

The reporter said: "I heard that there was a sealing of food rice in the suburban areas of Suzhou in the past, and now I think it has been resolved satisfactorily."

"Does the outside world know about this matter?" Governor Ren asked in surprise: "When the residents' rice was sealed, it happened that I was about to leave Suzhou. When I came back and learned about this matter, I stopped it."

The reporter said: "The public is certainly very grateful for this matter."

"These kinds of temporary events are not the main work of the provincial government. The current priorities of the provincial government are two points, which are production and education. Production and education are truly the great plans for the nation's centuries to come." Governor Ren said here, stood up, and gestured with his hand, saying: "First, there is currently a need to increase production, and the reasons need not be explained. We have already planned and promoted it from all aspects. Most of the Shanghai citizens who were evacuated this time have working abilities. Therefore, we hope that they will come to Jiangsu Province to set up small factories or handicrafts. The prosperity and construction of Jiangsu Province is expected to be greatly influenced by them. Second, the improvement of the level of education is now being pursued with all our strength. The low level of education, the frivolous academic atmosphere, and the weakening of students' physical condition are undeniable facts.

"The occurrence of this incident was certainly complex, but the students' frivolous and boisterous behavior at the time also had an impact. For example, people on the boat were all shouting this and that, forcing the helmsman to lose his mind and watch the boat sail towards the reef. Did the rulers at the time intend to go to war? … Declaring war and making peace are matters for the government leaders. The public should place the important task of decision-making on the shoulders of the government leaders. If everyone has their own ideas, the helmsman will not be able to steer the boat steadily, and it will hit the reef, causing such a tragic situation. This is truly a regrettable thing.

"Therefore, in the past, someone shouted, 'Study without forgetting to save the country,' but I say the opposite, 'Save the country without forgetting to study.' Studying is saving the country. During the period of studying, especially middle school students, it doesn't hurt to temporarily forget about saving the country. I have pointed this out to the students here more than once.

"Therefore, what the provincial government wants to improve is not only intellectual education. We want to create a steady, calm, and lively academic atmosphere. Lively is not frivolous; steady, calm, and lively is true liveliness. We are planning to promote extracurricular activities such as walking and labor to enhance students' physical fitness. Without a sound body, let alone saving the country, you can't even save yourself. The revival of the country can only start with the most fundamental education.

"Based on this principle, the treatment of educational personnel throughout the province has been raised to the same level as civil servants. Whenever there are matters involving school buildings, I always try my best to negotiate and find ways to avoid them."

Finally, Governor Ren waved his fist and said solemnly: "We are determined to do our best in this regard. We know that the effect will certainly be very meager, but we cannot not do it because it is meager. The seemingly meager effect will have a great impact on the future."
