### Kyushu and Shikoku Southeast Seas - Three Enemy Warships Sunk or Destroyed - Japanese Air Force - Brave Ramming Tactics Yield Results

Tokyo, 18th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced at 1:30 PM on the 18th: An enemy task force appeared in the southeast sea off Kyushu. Since 6:00 AM on the 18th, carrier-based aircraft have continued their wave-like attacks on the southeastern region of Kyushu. Japanese forces in the area immediately engaged, and are successively achieving considerable results.

Tokyo, 18th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese Air Force, defending the homeland, launched a courageous attack on the enemy task force appearing in the southern seas off Kyushu and Shikoku on the morning of the 18th, employing ramming tactics. They achieved the results of sinking one enemy battleship or converted aircraft carrier, sinking one cruiser with bombs, and setting one standard aircraft carrier ablaze. The attack is still ongoing.

Enemy Carrier-Based Aircraft, 800 Strong, Attack Kyushu and Shikoku in Waves

Tokyo, 18th (Central News Agency) - The enemy task force, silent for half a month, has reappeared in the southeastern sea off Kyushu. At 6:00 AM, they resumed their customary wave attacks on airfields in the southern and eastern regions of Kyushu, using their main force of carrier-based aircraft. Another unit attacked Shikoku and Wakayama Prefecture. The total number of enemy aircraft attacking in the morning was about 800. Japanese forces in the area vigorously engaged, achieving significant results. According to reports, after the enemy task force attacked the Kanto region with 600 carrier-based aircraft on February 16th and 17th, and then again on February 25th with 600 carrier-based aircraft, they changed direction and attacked the Southwestern Islands with around 600 carrier-based aircraft. Judging from the number of aircraft in these three attacks, there is a clear tendency for the number to decrease with each attack. From this, it is evident that the enemy suffered heavy damage each time they attacked. It is believed that after the enemy task force attacked the Southwestern Islands on the 1st, they returned to their rear base on Ulithi and the Caroline Islands to replenish their losses, and after resupply, reappeared off the coast of Kyushu and began to stir.

### American Aircraft Production Fails to Replenish Losses

Central News Agency Report - The American B-29 bombers, using the Mariana Islands as their base, have been bombing Japan. Recently, their activities have become increasingly intense, with air raids on Tokyo on the 9th of this month, Nagoya on the 11th, Osaka on the 15th, and Kobe on the 17th. The Americans have claimed great results, but the reality is not so. The current strength and future operational capability of the B-29 bombers, which the Americans call "flying fortresses," are outlined below: According to announcements by the Allied side, the number of aircraft participating in the three air raids on Japan from the 9th to the 13th of this month was 300 each time. However, according to reliable Japanese investigations, the numbers were 130 on the 9th, 130 on the 11th, 90 on the 13th, and 60 on the 17th. This shows that the Americans are exaggerating the number of participating aircraft to intimidate and spread propaganda. Furthermore, whether the Americans are using the same aircraft each time they raid Japan is also a very interesting question. This is because the Japanese anti-aircraft forces have inflicted damage on the enemy in Tokyo, Nagoya, Osaka, and other locations, shooting down 48 aircraft and damaging 170. It is a fact that the Americans are replenishing the downed aircraft with new ones and repairing the damaged ones for reuse. Judging from the number of aircraft participating in the attacks, the number of damaged aircraft, and the fact that the same aircraft are being used repeatedly, the actual number of B-29 aircraft at the Mariana Islands base is at most 250. Although the base can accommodate 350, the number of aircraft participating in raids on Japan is decreasing each time. From this, it can be seen that the Americans' offensive power is at its maximum at this level. The claims by the Americans that 300 aircraft participated in each raid, or that the Mariana base can accommodate 700 or even 800 aircraft, are simply not true. As for how the B-29 aircraft will operate in the future, this is closely related to the Americans' ability to replenish them and the amount of damage inflicted by the Japanese anti-aircraft forces. The production facilities for the American B-29 aircraft have been fixed and there is no geometric increase in production capacity or technology. It is said that the monthly production number between June and July of last year was 120, and by December it had only increased to 135. Therefore, the current monthly production number seems to be 100 to 150. Last year, the Japanese anti-aircraft forces inflicted heavy damage, shooting down 675 aircraft, which exceeded the production volume, so their stock has been sharply reduced. Furthermore, the number of B-29 aircraft lost during air raids on Japan this year has been increasing with each attack. In January, 74 aircraft were shot down and 141 were damaged. In February, 78 were shot down and 52 were damaged. In March (up to yesterday), 68 were shot down and 210 were damaged. This totals 220 shot down and 403 damaged, which, combined with last year's total, amounts to a huge number of 1,298 aircraft shot down or damaged. Assuming that half of the damaged aircraft can be repaired and reused, the number of losses suffered by the Japanese is no less than 1,060 aircraft. Although 130 aircraft can be produced each month, due to transportation and other factors, only 85 can actually be supplied to the front lines. Therefore, the number of losses suffered by the Japanese is equivalent to ten months of American production. Based on the above statistics, the future of the B-29 aircraft is quite bleak. The recent silence of the American Air Force stationed in China, and the reduction in the number of B-29 aircraft raiding Japan, are sufficient to prove this.

### Japanese Army Results in Henan Province in February

### Weekly War Situation in Various Parts of East Asia

Tokyo, 18th (Central News Agency) - The notable characteristics of this week's war situation in Greater East Asia are that the focus of enemy naval operations has gradually shifted away from Iwo Jima, while the enemy's air force base development in the Marshall and Mariana Islands is progressing significantly. Also, the enemy task force is consolidating its offensive bases in preparation for various next-stage operations.

(1) Iwo Jima Area: Enemy forces have gradually penetrated the northern bases of Iwo Jima. The Japanese garrison at Mt. Tamana launched a major assault on the enemy's position on the 8th, fighting bravely until the 13th, when most of them were gloriously killed in action. The Japanese position on Mt. Tenzan repeatedly repelled the enemy's attacks, but finally fell into enemy hands on the 13th. Since the enemy landed on the island on the 19th of last month, the Japanese garrison has inflicted a total of 25,800 casualties on the enemy, as announced by the Japanese Imperial Headquarters on the 16th, demonstrating the intensity of the fighting by the Japanese garrison soldiers.

(2) Philippine Area: Since the enemy landed in Lingayen Gulf, the Japanese army has killed or wounded 90,000 enemy soldiers in two months up to the 8th, inflicting enormous damage, and has also inflicted huge damage on a large number of enemy artillery and military supplies. The morale of the Japanese army is still very high, and they are continuing to fight bravely. Enemy forces in the Manila area are intensifying their attacks on the eastern region of Manila, and their shelling is also gradually intensifying. The Japanese forces in the Clark area are continuing to fight, and there is no major change in the situation. The actions in northern Luzon have recently become more active, and they are gradually using their technology to overcome the difficulties of the terrain, building roads in the mountainous areas, attempting to gradually extend inland, and placing special emphasis on the coastal area, pouring in three divisions. The first line has advanced to the Pengkeng and Kalangglang areas, and there is also a tendency for Salaksaksak to attempt to extend towards the Bayumbong plains. The Japanese forces stationed there repelled them. Furthermore, the enemy forces that landed in Zamboanga on Mindanao Island on the morning of the 9th have been repeatedly carrying out naval gun bombardment and strafing for days. Fierce fighting continues near the airfield outside the city.

(3) Burma Area: The New First Army and the 50th Division in northern Burma are continuing to advance on the Mandalay area of Lashio. The battle centered on Mandalay has suddenly intensified. An enemy armored unit with 50-60 tanks infiltrated the vicinity of Meiktila. After being fiercely attacked from both the north and south by Japanese forces, the various airfields that had once fallen into enemy hands were completely retaken, and are currently under siege. The Indian 39th Division, which crossed the Irrawaddy River 70 kilometers north of Mandalay, is gradually moving south and infiltrated Mandalay on the 8th of this month. At the same time, the enemy in the Myingyan and Kyaukse areas west of Mandalay is also gradually advancing. On the 9th, they also approached the northern area of Myittha, 30 kilometers southwest of Mandalay. The Japanese forces in Mandalay are defending the royal city and engaging in fierce fighting with the enemy. The elite forces in the southern bank region of the Irrawaddy River are also fiercely attacking the enemy.

(4) Indian Ocean Area: This week, enemy forces in the Indian Ocean area have only been operating with a few small vessels north of the Andaman Islands.

Editorial

### Contradictions of the Anti-Axis Powers

The convening of the Crimean Conference not only revealed the deep contradictions between the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union, necessitating a meeting to resolve them, but also, judging from the communique issued after the meeting, the political issues at the center of the contradictions among the three countries were not resolved at all. Britain and the United States instead made concessions to the Soviet Union under the military premise of continuing the war against Germany, in order to seek temporary cooperation. In other words, the Crimean Conference not only did not eliminate the contradictions among the three countries, but also sowed new seeds for future disputes.

The fundamental reason for these contradictions is, of course, the differences in the political systems and policies of the three countries, and also the inevitable result of each country seeking to expand its power. Britain, in order to maintain its pre-war status, has been trying to induce the United States and the Soviet Union to divide Europe's spheres of influence in advance before the war ends. The United States, relying on its strong economic power, is convinced that it will be able to conquer Europe economically after the war and then conquer it politically. Therefore, it advocates an open door policy and equal opportunity, and opposes Britain's proposed division plan. The Soviet Union, on the other hand, is trying to avoid discussing post-war issues at the moment, and is advocating military first, because in the course of the war, the Soviet Union is in fact constantly expanding its occupied territories, using the expansion of its military power to increase its say in Europe and even the world. It demands that Britain and the United States tie down German forces on the Western Front, so that its military operations can proceed smoothly and its territory can continue to expand. It also demands that the United States continue its Lend-Lease Act, so that its military power can be even greater. This is also the most practical plan for the Soviet Union to expand its own power.

Therefore, in recent months: The Soviet Union undermined Britain's planned "Western European Alliance" plan. The Soviet Union's request to the United States for a large supply of heavy industrial machinery and a 6 billion gold ruble credit loan was rejected by the United States. On the other hand, the British and Americans' conspiracy to alienate Japanese-Soviet relations, causing the Soviet Union to disperse its forces and consume its national strength, has never been considered by the Soviet Union. And recently, at the International Labor Conference held in London, the resolution to thoroughly carry out the anti-Japanese war was instead proposed solely by the Soviet Union, which prides itself on being the motherland of labor.

The alliance of the anti-Axis powers was originally an alliance of interests. The blindly following weak countries are merely for the use and sacrifice of the three powers. Consider the Bonomi government of Italy, which has always been regarded as a despicable traitor. The Crimean Conference communique did not mention a word about Italy under the Bonomi government. Consider the Chongqing government, which is often included in the ranks of the four powers for the sake of temptation, but was not invited to participate in this important conference on dividing the world. The de Gaulle government of France, which has been the most loyal and contributed the most to the anti-Axis powers, was treated as a "liberated country" in the communique, and its repeated requests to participate in the Crimean Conference were never accepted. ... From this, it can be seen that the attitude of the three countries towards weak countries in the Crimean Conference alone has been fully revealed. No matter how Britain and the United States use economic oppression, intimidation, and sweet words to force many weak countries that have always maintained neutrality to declare war on Japan and Germany, in reality, none of them are sincerely convinced. This kind of action does not help the strength of the anti-Axis powers, it can be asserted.

### Enemy Casualties on Iwo Jima Reach Over 30,000 - Japanese Forces Still Tenaciously Defend Strongholds and Counterattack

Tokyo, 18th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese strongholds on Iwo Jima have been gradually penetrated by enemy forces, so communication links have also been severed.

### Japanese Forces Continue to Assault in Zamboanga

Philippine Base, 18th (Central News Agency) - The enemy near Zamboanga has repeatedly concentrated attacks on the Japanese army positions near the mountain foothills north of the city.

Also, at 2:30 PM on the 15th, enemy infantry units, under the cover of three tanks and 14 mortars, attacked the Japanese army barracks in Zamboanga. After fierce fighting, the Japanese army repelled the enemy by evening. On that day, another enemy unit concentrated 18 field guns and attacked the Japanese army positions.

### The Evil Battle of Iwo Jima in the Mouths of the American Enemy - The War Situation is Tragic, Unprecedented and Unrepeatable

According to front-line news from Guam, American forces on Iwo Jima encountered fierce counterattacks from Japanese forces around Mt. Suribachi and the northern area of the South Airfield, and losses are increasing at an accelerated rate, and the situation is precarious. Lieutenant General Taylor therefore dispatched the 3rd Marine Division under Major General Erskine to land and reinforce, but the American forces are still in a difficult situation. According to a statement released by Admiral Nimitz Headquarters on February 23rd, the American forces seem to have launched another attack on the Japanese positions at the Central Airfield and Mt. Suribachi, but the Japanese forces are fiercely bombarding with heavy artillery and rocket artillery during the day, and at night are launching continuous night attacks with suicide squads, so bitter and evil battles continue endlessly. Associated Press special correspondent Elmont Waite sighed: "The Japanese army is fighting to the death at all points on the line."

American war correspondents' front-line dispatches unanimously describe the plight of the American forces, who are trapped by the fierce attacks of the Japanese army and the difficult terrain. Marine Corps war correspondent David Dempsey telegraphed on the 22nd: "Four days after the American forces forcibly landed under heavy Japanese fire, by February 22nd the American front line had been completely destroyed, and the tragic situation is indescribable. Two miles north of Mt. Suribachi at the southern end, fragments have accumulated into a thick layer. The wreckage of dozens of boats proves the price the American forces paid when landing on this island. Japanese heavy artillery, artillery, and rocket artillery are roaring day and night, spreading a barrage of shells on the beach, and their shooting is exceptionally accurate. This coast is composed of volcanic ash, and most vehicles sank deeply into it before advancing even ten feet, making it difficult to move, and the high rock walls on the coast also hinder the advance of vehicles, allowing the Japanese artillery fire to take advantage and shoot fiercely. Only a few trucks have landed in the two days, and all supplies are being transported to the front line by manpower. The large amphibious trucks that are deeply sunk in the gray sand are like pancakes fried in an iron pot. After the cranes used for unloading landed, they tipped to one side, and the cannons being unloaded were destroyed before they could be used. The subsequent vehicles also had no time to clear the way. Clothing packages, gas masks, sundries, etc., were mostly destroyed by Japanese shrapnel shells and scattered along a five-mile area, interspersed with countless broken guns and swords, as well as letters from American soldiers. War has truly penetrated human life. Death is soaring among the wreckage. The bodies of American soldiers on the beach are mostly buried in the sand by the waves." John Hoover, a spokesman for the US Central Pacific Front Headquarters, also said: "The Iwo Jima operation is the most difficult battle for the US military in the Pacific. When the Marine Corps landed, it was not initially resisted by heavy artillery fire, but the Japanese army immediately opened fire and attacked fiercely, and American tanks and soldiers were damaged and killed one after another, giving the impression that the landing stronghold was about to collapse. This battle is more difficult than the Battle of Saipan. In the first 57 hours after landing, the average number of casualties per hour was higher than in any battle in the Central Pacific to date."

Also, from a telegram from New York, BBC correspondent Hart Satchia broadcast the war situation on Iwo Jima from the flagship of Lieutenant General Taylor in the sea off Iwo Jima on the 22nd, saying: "An intense battle is currently unfolding on Iwo Jima that cannot be compared to any battle to date. The situation is tragic, and the island can be renamed Hell Island, which is hair-raising to say. I have witnessed the Marine Corps resolutely landing, crawling forward, and engaging in bayonet fighting with the Japanese army. This tactic requires extraordinary effort. The artillery battle between the Japanese and American sides never ceases throughout the night. If there is a hell in the world, then this Iwo Jima must be it. This landing operation is certainly not easy, and its difficulty is truly unexpected. Japanese mortars and heavy artillery barrages are everywhere. The landing craft destroyed on the beach are all over the place. A battle that can be compared to the Battle of Iwo Jima has never been seen before." (Lisbon Allied News Agency) (Translated from the Yomiuri Hochi on February 25th)

### Intense Street Fighting in Mandalay and the Royal City; Fierce Attacks by Japanese Infantry and Artillery

### Shanghai's Financial, Industrial, and Commercial Situation Last Week; Stable Market Prices, Stock Market Strong

The financial, industrial, and commercial situation in Shanghai has remained stable in the past week, with little change in transactions. The black market exchange rate fluctuated slightly, silver remained unchanged, and public bonds saw mixed gains and losses with weak trading. The stock market, on the other hand, has been improving due to the recent easing of credit, which is favorable to bulls. People are generally less concerned about buying stocks, so the stock market trend is improving daily, and trading is brisk. The prices of the three popular stocks are rising. The situation in various industries is also better than in the past. Although factories have not been able to fully resume production, it seems that the balance between supply and demand is being restored due to the small number of consumers. The transportation situation is better than before, and the difficulties in transporting local products have slightly decreased. The sources of rice, grains, oil, vegetables, and other raw materials are gradually becoming smoother, and people's livelihood is slightly stabilized. Market prices are generally stable. At the same time, the authorities' efforts to suppress prices have been effective, and speculation and hoarding have disappeared, so it is difficult to see a price surge again in the short term.

Interest Rate Increase Requested for Deposit Reserves

Banks and money shops in Shanghai have deposited a deposit reserve of 5% or more for fixed-term deposits and special current deposits, and 10% or more for current deposits, with the Central Reserve Bank, opening reserve accounts, in accordance with Articles 1 and 2 of the Implementation Rules of the Interim Measures for the Management of Financial Institutions promulgated by the Ministry of Finance. It is understood that the bankers' association believes that the interest rate on these deposits is very low, with a difference too large between that and the interest paid to depositors. They have jointly requested the Financial Affairs Inspection Department of the Central Reserve Bank to increase the deposit interest rate. They have consulted twice, the first time agreeing to change the interest rate from 3% to 4%, but the second time the department has not yet approved the increase.

### On Residential Electricity Consumption

— Qian Zhonghe

On February 28th, I received an electricity bill notification from the French Concession Electricity Company (usually received around the 20th, probably due to slow postal delivery). It stipulated electricity consumption limits, and these limits varied for each household. Even users with the same limit in the past were not the same this time. After inquiring and researching, I found the following calculations that are hard to understand (all users were previously not allowed to exceed 13 degrees).

1.  For those who did not use the full 13 degrees last month, the limit is calculated at half price, with a limit of less than 6.5 degrees.
2.  If three-tenths more were used last month, the new limit is 3.5 degrees.
3.  If six-tenths more were used, the limit is 3 degrees.
4.  If 2.7 degrees more were used, the limit is 3 degrees.
5.  If 2.5 degrees more were used, the limit is 4.5 degrees.

From the above records, it can be seen that the electricity company is penalizing those who are not sincerely assisting in conserving electricity. This penalty should be agreed with in principle, but monthly electricity consumption is calculated from the 8th of the month. Before receiving the new limit notification, users always assumed that the "limit was less than 6.5 degrees." Now, suddenly receiving this notification on the 28th, the penalized users will inevitably be greatly affected. Therefore, we hope that the company will have a flexible solution to this point.

### Rice Market—Caohejing

— Jia Xi

The rice consumed by Shanghai residents is partly supplied by Caohejing. Therefore, Shanghai people have a deep impression of Caohejing.

The area does not produce rice. Its main products are cotton, soybeans, and vegetables. The reason it has become a rice distribution center is due to the inconvenience of transportation in recent years. Rice from Songjiang, Sijing, and other places cannot be directly transported to Shanghai, so it is transported to Caohejing by river, and then carried by rice traders to Shanghai. More than a thousand stones of rice pass through here every day. After the rice reaches Caohejing, it has already passed through many "checkpoints," so local market prices are not much different from those in Shanghai. For example, on the 16th of this month, market prices were: indica rice about 8,400 yuan per dou, ordinary Songjiang white rice about 8,800 yuan, and japonica rice about 9,100 yuan. Vegetables are relatively cheap, only 150 yuan per jin, while pork costs 800-900 yuan per jin.

Three Hopes

To understand the local situation, I interviewed Chen Xueyu, the head of Caohejing Township. He said, "The township has 18 bao, with about 9,000 residents, most of whom are farmers. There is one Caohejing Primary School, with about 300 students, which is run by the township office. The security situation is very good, with the First Battalion of the First Regiment stationed here." Talking about the difficulties of the township office and the decline of the local people's livelihood, Township Head Chen said he had three hopes: (1) He hopes that Shanghai charitable organizations will pay attention to the lives of the poor in the suburbs. There have never been porridge distributions or other charities in Caohejing. The 400 sets of winter clothing last winter were still requested by the township office from the Bureau of Social Welfare. (2) He hopes that Shanghai bankers will provide agricultural loans, as farmers urgently need funds now that spring plowing is approaching. (3) He hopes that the government authorities will consider the difficulties of the township office, because the township office has no funds and relies only on donations from local shops to maintain itself. The obligations it bears are very heavy. The supply of firewood alone requires 50-60 dan per month, not to mention other expenses.

Industrial Stagnation

Local land transportation includes the Shanghai-Hangzhou Road and the Caobao Road to Qibao. Water transportation is the Caohe River, which connects to the Huangpu River in the east and Qibao, Sijing, and Songjiang in the west. Many rice boats and firewood boats arrive here every day. There are four rice mills, but recently, due to the suspension of motor electricity supply and the high cost of diesel engines, the amount of rice milled has been greatly reduced from more than 1,000 stones per day in the past. Few cotton gins are operating because the price of buying cotton is not enough to cover costs. As a result, farmers have had to switch to growing soybeans and vegetables, so cotton production has decreased compared to previous years. There is one small yarn factory, Xingnong Company, and one Dazhong Hosiery Factory. Before the war, local handicraft industries such as lace were very developed, but in recent years, maritime transportation has been blocked, and they have also been stagnant for a long time.

Social Service; Free Primary School Actively Promoted

Xie Lilin Suggests Setting Up a Free School Fund

The fact that this place is preparing to set up a free primary school has been briefly recorded in this column on the 15th. Our motivation stems from the previous winter vacation training meeting for primary school teachers to assist in the further studies of primary school teachers. The instructors explained carefully and their enthusiasm was commendable. The listening teachers humbly built their foundation, and the mood was harmonious. In this environment, two kinds of sympathy were jointly generated, one for the loss of schooling for poor students, and the other for the unemployment of some primary school teachers. Due to the development of sympathy, it was also jointly recognized that if unemployed teachers educate out-of-school children, it is a win-win situation. Based on the above views, after discussion, we asked this newspaper to run a free primary school. That is our motivation. As for our purpose, it is very simple, that is, to hope to achieve the education of out-of-school children by unemployed teachers.

In order to realize this work, we have set up a "Shen Bao Free Education Committee" to be responsible for handling it. The first meeting was held the other day, and opinions were fully exchanged on issues such as borrowing school buildings, selecting teachers, collecting books, setting courses, and budgeting expenses. We believe that this work originally requires the strength of the country or the strength of society to be effectively raised, and it is by no means something that a group or a few people can undertake. At the same time, we do not want to run it arrogantly or secretly. In the future, all work will be reported to society publicly at any time, and we hope that readers will give guidance and assistance.

The most urgent need at present is still the raising of funds. Although we have received the enthusiasm of the charity market sponsored by the four groups, and donated 1 million yuan for start-up expenses, however, based on our lowest estimate, the recurring expenses are still not enough. However, we are willing to actively promote the work first, in order to create facts that arouse the sympathy and support of people in society. Here, we will first publish Mr. Xie Lilin's loan for readers. Mr. Xie suggested opening a "Free School Fund" and first donated money to promote it. His suggestion and his enthusiasm are in line with our purpose. Of course, we hope that everyone will respond.

Mr. Xie Lilin's Free School Fund

Mr. Xie wrote in his letter: "Recently, I saw the social service news in your newspaper and was pleased to learn that ten free primary schools were being run, on the one hand, to save children who had lost their schooling, and on the other hand, to subsidize the lives of teachers. The intention is excellent. But the need for free primary schools in Shanghai is more than just ten. The expenses required for free schools can hardly be met by the surplus funds from the charity market. This promotion of free education cannot be accomplished without the joint assistance of social people. I think that the reader's student aid fund founded by your newspaper has made remarkable achievements. Now, it is better to follow this method and open a free primary school student aid fund, abbreviated as "Free School Fund." Your newspaper serves society and is known for its reputation. With a call, the donations for the "Free School Fund" will surely come in a steady stream. I will donate 10,000 yuan in savings bonds, which I have saved from my daily savings, to be used as the "Reader's Free School Fund." This small amount is not enough to promote, but I hope to lead the way and respond together, so that out-of-school children can be made into useful talents, which is a great blessing for society and a great blessing for the country. Xie Lilin, March 16th"

### Recommendations on the Evacuation of Fellow Villagers from Hebei and Shandong

— Kong Keqiu

Recently, Shanghai has been publishing some news about the evacuation of the population in the newspapers every day. Originally, there were many people who wanted to return to their hometown, but most of them were watching and waiting because it was difficult to buy train tickets and problems often occurred along the way. Now, I have prepared the following measures for the evacuation of citizens from Hebei and Shandong provinces for reference.

(1) Those who evacuate voluntarily (fellow villagers) should first register with the fellow villager association, and then hand over the train fare to the designated bank in exchange for a receipt.

(2) The fellow villager association shall submit a request to the Evacuation Committee to handle the purchase of tickets and arrange transportation.

(3) Women and children are allowed to be accompanied by eleven men, but adult men are not allowed to be accompanied by adult men, in order to prevent single travelers from mixing in. Returnees must have a return permit, and escorts are exempt.

(4) Publish a notice to exchange bank receipts for official train tickets, and issue certificates to be hung on the front of the outer clothing. Every ten people form a team, and elect a team leader to take care of the women and children along the way. Seats should be given to women and children as much as possible. The fellow villager association shall elect a chief commander to escort them to Shandong and Hebei provinces. In case of accidents, the orders of the chief commander must be obeyed.
