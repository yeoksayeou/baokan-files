### The Tug-of-War at the Main Battleground in Central Okinawa; Heavy Japanese Artillery Bombard Naha's Outskirts

Tokyo, 19th (Central News Agency Telegram) - Since the enemy forces landed on Okinawa Island and began attacking the main Japanese army positions in the southern part of the island on April 8th, over forty days have passed. The common enemy has only advanced four kilometers, with an average advance rate of approximately one kilometer every ten days. However, enemy casualties are inversely proportional to their advance speed. Since the enemy's landing, they have lost 40,000 soldiers, most of whom were sacrificed within that four-kilometer range. Currently, the battle between the Japanese and American forces on the main island is extremely fierce, and enemy casualties are expected to increase even more dramatically.

A certain base, 19th (Central News Agency Telegram) - Disregarding their severe losses, enemy forces on Okinawa Island continue to fiercely attack the main Japanese army positions. On the eastern front, the enemy's 96th Division retreated to the rear for a time due to intense Japanese counterattacks, but on the 18th, it returned to the front lines and was positioned on the far-left flank. The current disposition of enemy forces, from east to west, consists of the 96th, 97th, 77th, 1st Marine Division, and 6th Marine Division. The heart of the fierce battle remains in the central main battleground, where both sides are engaged in a tug-of-war. On the 18th, a total of 145 enemy aircraft attacked Okinawa Island, with the primary goal of suppressing Japanese special attack forces.

Lisbon, 19th (Central News Agency Telegram) - An Associated Press war correspondent at the Okinawa front reported on the 18th that an unprecedentedly fierce artillery battle, the largest since the beginning of the Pacific War, has erupted on the entire Okinawa front. The report stated: When the U.S. Tenth Army advanced into the areas in front of Shuri and Naha, the Okinawa front suddenly erupted into the largest artillery battle of the Pacific War. The Japanese army continued to concentrate an unprecedented number of heavy artillery pieces, intensely bombarding the American forces, thereby hindering the American advance.

### Japanese Air Force Intensely Attacks and Heavily Damages Enemy Ships and Airfields; Smoke Fills the Seas Around Okinawa

Southern Japanese Base, 19th (Central News Agency Telegram) - On the 18th, fierce battles continued on Okinawa Island. The enemy deployed over a hundred tanks and approximately five thousand troops on the front lines, and the Japanese side also exerted its full strength to repel the enemy forces. Meanwhile, the Japanese Air Force also responded to the ground forces by continuously attacking enemy ships around the island. As a result, the seas around the island have been shrouded in smoke since the morning of the 18th. As of 7:30 AM on the 18th, the disposition of enemy ships was as follows: In the waters off Kadena, there were two battleships, five cruisers, ten destroyers, twenty large boats, and twenty electric boats. In the waters off Minatoga, there was one destroyer. In Nakagusuku Bay, there was one cruiser and twenty transport ships. In the waters off Kerama, there was one battleship, three cruisers, five destroyers, and fifty transport ships. Due to the intense attacks by both the Japanese army and air force on that day, the enemy ships suffered considerable damage. As of that evening, the Japanese and American forces were still engaged in fierce battle, and the Japanese side's results have not yet been confirmed.

Southwest Island Base, 19th (Central News Agency Telegram) - From the night of the 17th to the night of the 18th, the Japanese Air Force attacked enemy ships and airfields around Okinawa Island. On the 17th, one enemy cruiser was sunk, and one large ship was hit by a torpedo and exploded. On the morning of the 18th, attacks were resumed on the northern and central airfields of the island, causing fires in several locations. Simultaneously, in the waters north of the Kerama Islands, one enemy battleship or cruiser, attacked by Japanese aircraft, caught fire and sank. Furthermore, in the waters off Itoman, one enemy destroyer was fiercely blazing with fire. Later, during the night of the 18th, another attack was carried out, with one enemy large ship hit by a torpedo, and causing explosions and continuous fires at several land-based airfields. Moreover, during the daytime of the 18th, in the waters off Aguni Island, one enemy destroyer ran aground. The Japanese garrison immediately launched a fierce attack and sank it. At the same time, a fierce battle ensued with several small transport ships and landing craft that came to rescue the destroyer, sinking one of each.

Ryukyu Peninsula Base, 19th (Central News Agency Telegram) - The war results of the Japanese Air Force attacks on enemy ships around Okinawa on the 17th and 18th, as confirmed to date, include the sinking and destruction of five enemy ships, detailed as follows: On the night of the 17th, one cruiser was sunk, and one large ship was destroyed, with five columns of fire observed off Kerama. On the morning of the 18th, one destroyer that ran aground off the western coast of the island was sunk, and one battleship or cruiser was sunk in the waters north of Kerama. In the waters south of the island, one ship was sunk. Furthermore, during the morning and night attacks on the 18th, large fires were started at several locations in the central and northern airfields.

### Expectations for the Suzuki Cabinet – By Tokutomi Sohō

We welcome the Suzuki Cabinet. This is not necessarily because it is the best cabinet at present, but at least we believe it is a fighting cabinet. What determines our success or failure is whether we have a cabinet filled with passion, with an unwavering belief in victory, and integrated with the people, or a cabinet that is颓唐萎靡 (spiritless), and unconsciously leads the people toward defeat? If the Suzuki Cabinet is the former and not the latter, then naturally we will exert our utmost efforts to support it.

Since the Greater East Asia War began, the cabinet has already changed twice. If the Suzuki Cabinet is not a strong cabinet, it will not last a single day, which is a well-known fact. The Suzuki Navy Admiral himself, a most cautious man throughout his life, is violating his own nature, like a lion who suddenly opens his eyes, and then boldly comes forth. This is truly old age in good health.

However, honestly examining the lineup of the new cabinet, although they are all highly respected figures, the current situation is not one that can be handled by merely highly respected figures. We have boundless expectations and hopes for Mr. Abe Genki, the Minister of Home Affairs. Mr. Abe is indeed a well-known and reliable figure in terms of his thinking, and he can use his talents to address the current situation. However, the soul of the cabinet lies more in the Prime Minister than in the cabinet members. Therefore, the success or failure of the Suzuki Cabinet will depend on the future attitude of the Prime Minister himself. We all wholeheartedly admire Prime Minister Suzuki. Since the Meiji Restoration, those who have held the position of Prime Minister of Japan, from Duke Sanjō in the first year of Meiji to Admiral Suzuki this time, have served in forty-two cabinets. Although some have served only once, figures such as Duke Itō and Duke Katsura have even served three times. In terms of the age of the Prime Minister, those over seventy years old include Duke Ōkuma and Baron Hiranuma, all of whom are younger than Prime Minister Suzuki, who is nearly eighty years old. As an old prime minister, Georges Clemenceau, who saved France from danger and turned the tide of the situation, was only seventy-seven years old at the time of his service, two years younger than Admiral Suzuki. Today's situation is incomparable to when Duke Ōkuma succeeded the Yamamoto Cabinet in the past. Now, when the enemy Americans have already landed on the Japanese mainland, we admire Admiral Suzuki's courage in taking over the position in the face of this crisis. However, we should especially understand that his sense of responsibility to serve the Emperor is extremely ardent, which we should sincerely understand and not regard as ordinary.

However, in addition to expressing our respect, we also have concerns. Today's politics is like a spider web; once you fall into it, you cannot move your hands and feet. Therefore, we cannot help but pray that Prime Minister Suzuki will, from beginning to end, carry out his claims. The ancients said that cautious people often have the fault of seeking perfection in everything. From one perspective, Duke Itō, who was almost oblivious to others and made sweeping assertions, was even satirized by some as someone who tried to please everyone. If Prime Minister Suzuki truly wants to satisfy everyone, then he will achieve nothing, and consequently, no one will be satisfied. In short, even if the whole country opposes him, he should fearlessly implement his actions, just like Clemenceau. Admiral Suzuki's courage has already been proven in the Weihaiwei torpedo attack, the destroyer night attack in the Battle of the Sea of Japan, and his escape from death in the February 26th Incident (ten deaths and one survival is more appropriate). This is also something that everyone in the world knows. What I hope for is that he will use this courage to adopt and discard all worldly opinions and quickly establish a system for our country to achieve certain victory. Prime Minister Suzuki's first words after taking office were, "Step over my dead body and continue to advance," which proves that he has unparalleled determination.

Moderate people are always reluctant to provoke others when doing things. However, this will not work today. We must do politics that attracts attention and moves people. Recent politicians almost all have the fault of trying to do great things with little money, but spending one hundred yuan effectively once is better than spending one yuan a thousand times. The reason why any kind of politics fails to win the hearts of the people is the result of small-spending politics. The old veterans of the Meiji era were most aware of this point. The reason why we constantly shout loudly, hoping that the Emperor will personally administer the government, is for this reason. In short, the most important task of the government is to gain the trust of the people. To gain the trust of the people, we must first seek the truth of the matter. We hope that the Suzuki Cabinet will break with past practices and first promulgate politics that will gain the trust of the people.

Originally, the government always asked the people to persevere, but it could not persevere itself and constantly changed, regardless of the reason, which is definitely not a reason to win the trust of the people. We hope that before asking the people to persevere, the Suzuki Cabinet will first resolve to persevere with the spirit of riding the waves. In short, in today's extraordinary times, the vast authority of article 31 of the Constitution should be invoked to mobilize all of Japan to strive for victory. Whether Suzuki's cabinet is a strong cabinet or a weak cabinet can be judged on this issue.

Enemy Mobile Force Attempts to Approach Kyushu; Mines Dropped Near Lake Biwa

It is understood that the Military Affairs Commission will abolish the General Affairs Department, the Military Affairs Department, and the Military Command Department, and their responsibilities will be transferred to the Army Ministry and the Military Command Department. The important matters originally handled by the three departments will be transferred and assigned to the Military Command Department, and the transfer procedures are currently underway. The Military Command Department is scheduled to be formally established at the end of this month, and the high-level personnel appointments for the Military Command Department have been largely decided and will be announced within the next few days.

### The Organization and Operational Guidelines of the Japanese National Volunteer Corps

In order to cope with the emergency situation and unite the people of the country to quickly complete the defense of the country, Japan organized the National Volunteer Corps. Regarding this matter, the Suzuki Cabinet inherited the plan of the Konoe Cabinet and decided on the organization policy at the cabinet meeting on April 13. At the cabinet meeting held on April 27 of the same month, it approved detailed organization, operation policies and the establishment of a National Volunteer Corps Council. All that is required is that organization be completed in late May. Since the institution of the Volunteer Corps has undergone scrutiny from the Konoe and Suzuki Cabinets, there are some differences in content between the two cabinets, so the special correspondent of the Japanese Mainichi Shimbun visited those in charge of drafting the plan in the Ministry of Interior to answer questions. Here are the answers on the organization and operation of the Volunteer Corps:

(Q) What is the character of the Volunteer Corps?

(A) The Volunteer Corps is a national organization that is completely action-oriented. It has three characteristics: 1. In peacetime, all members devote themselves to their original duties; 2. If necessary, they take the lead in the work necessary for the war; 3. Finally, if the National Volunteer Corps becomes a Combat Volunteer Corps, it will be under the command of the military to defend the homeland. Until now, national groups such as the Yokusanka (Imperial Rule Assistance Association) were a combination of like-minded members. However, the Volunteer Corps is the final national institution. Anything necessary for the war is done. In short, it is an organization that simultaneously engages in production and takes on the task of defense, combining production and defense into one, and maximizing its strength.

(Q) What is the organization like?

(A) The National Volunteer Corps is organized by city, town and village, and those in the workplace are organized by their workplace. In short, it is divided into two types of organization: organization by territory and organization by workplace. The city, town and village National Volunteer Corps are divided into men's teams and women's teams, with the mayor, town head and village head acting as leaders. As for workplace organizations, government offices, companies, and business establishments with a large number of people will have their leaders as the leader of the team. The upper-level structure of the territorial and workplace Volunteer Corps is the prefectural united National Volunteer Corps. National Volunteer Corps headquarters are placed in each prefecture and county. The local governor is the headquarters leader, supervising and executing the instruction of each county and city. The leader's strength and policy will have a significant impact. However, the leader may choose capable and experienced members from civilian circles and have them partake in operation. A central institution is not specially established, only a council with the Minister of the Interior as chairman is established. The council has 20 committee members, and knowledgeable people from all walks of life are selected to take charge of national operations and other matters.

(Q) What is the age of the Volunteer Corps members?

(A) All men under the age of 65 and women under the age of 45, who have completed elementary school or above, must participate, except for those who are sick, weak, and new mothers. However, those who are willing may also join, regardless of whether they fall under these categories. When reorganized into a combat team, it consists of men between the ages of 15 and 55 and women between the ages of 17 and 45.

(Q) What is the task of the Volunteer Corps?

(A) Planning and enriching military supplies and food supplies is the greatest task.

(Q) What happens when it becomes a combat team?

(A) When reorganized into a combat team, its important tasks are limited to the work necessary for combat, such as production, transportation, security, air defense, rescue, and other rear support matters. Depending on the circumstances, it may also engage in actual combat, but this will only be done in the worst-case scenario. In short, it is not an organization primarily aimed at bamboo spear training or grenade throwing, as rumored. The outside world has misunderstood this, and we hope to dispel this misunderstanding.

(Q) When will it be reorganized into a combat team?

(A) In areas where the situation is urgent, the regional Volunteer Corps will be reorganized into a Combat Volunteer Corps by order of the chief of the military district, the chief of the naval defense district, and the chief of the naval patrol district. Therefore, there are also cases where a certain district's Volunteer Corps is not reorganized into a combat team.

(Q) Is there a tendency for the Volunteer Corps organization to fall into a form of government operation?

(A) We hope that no matter where it is, it will be an organization that is united in spirit and avoids the mere expansion of previous organizational groups. Instead, it should be centered on people who have the ability to lead and are truly reliable in each district, and have the organization operate. (Excerpted from the May 2nd Mainichi Shimbun Special Report, to notify that the transfer will take place. Also, can obtain confirmed information from US President Truman's Washington speech to the effect that Truman expressed his willingness to meet with Teague, and at the same time can declare that the United States is willing to cede a portion of the US-occupied area in Germany to France, because the United States has learned that France can solve the various European issues.)

### Reform of the Japanese Ministry of Finance

Tokyo, 19th (Central News Agency Telegram) - Based on the resolution passed by the Cabinet on March 6 to strengthen austerity of administrative work, the Ministry of Finance has reformed the central and local organizations and operations during the tenure of the former Minister of Finance to adapt to the wartime situation. Partial personnel adjustments were also made in mid-March. Minister of Finance Hirose is continuing to proceed with the revision of the Ministry of Finance's organizational system. The revision was approved at the plenary session of the Privy Council on the 16th, and the temporary employee system for the Ministry of Finance's internal affairs and the revision of the Financial Bureau's organizational system were announced and implemented on the 19th. The main content of this revision of the organizational system is to establish three bureaus within the Ministry's central structure: the General Affairs Bureau, the Finance Bureau, and the Banking and Insurance Bureau. A new Financial Bureau is also established. In the local organizations, a portion of the central authority is delegated, and a southern section is newly established within the Financial Bureau.

Tokyo, 19th (Central News Agency Telegram) - Following the revision of the Ministry of Finance's organizational system, personnel changes were officially ordered on the 19th. Yoshio Shikimura, Director of the Finance Bureau and Director of the Banking and Insurance Bureau, was appointed as Director of the Financial Bureau. Kazuo Imanami, Director of the Sendai Financial Bureau, was appointed as Councilor. Goichi Nose, Deputy Director of the Moji Maritime Bureau, was appointed as Deputy Director of the Financial Bureau.

### Rumors of Transportation Restrictions by Central China Railway Refuted

Nanjing, 19th (Central News Agency Telegram) - Recently, rumors have spread that the Central China Railway Company will implement appropriate restrictions on passenger transportation due to wartime transportation conditions. Except for civil servants traveling on official business, ordinary citizens must have a letter of explanation from the Baotjia (Local Security System) Chief clearly stating the necessity of travel in order to be allowed to purchase tickets. A reporter inquired with the Ministry of Construction yesterday and was informed that this matter is purely a rumor. At present, railway transportation has been improving steadily due to continuous efforts, and efforts are being made to facilitate passenger travel. Therefore, there is no need to restrict travel.

Hangzhou Strengthens Air Defense Efforts, Hangzhou, 19th (Central News Agency Telegram) - The Air Defense Headquarters of Hangzhou City has established rescue teams in each district and begun training in various rescue operations in order to strengthen rescue work during enemy air raids. At the same time, district hospitals have been designated as emergency first-aid stations and treatment facilities in order to treat people affected by the air raids.

### He Yingqin and Others Propose Using Deposits in the United States; Also Request Publication of Account Names and Deposit Amounts

Central News Agency Dispatch from Chongqing: According to a Chongqing dispatch, at the 12th session of the Sixth National Congress of the Kuomintang, He Yingqin and 45 others proposed (requesting the Central Government to inform the U.S. government to investigate and report the detailed amounts of deposits accumulated by our country in U.S. banks and the names of the depositors, to be announced by the U.S. or our government, and to be confiscated, slightly used, or slightly taxed by our government for the purpose of assisting the war effort). After discussion, it was unanimously passed (submitted to the National Government for prompt investigation and expedited handling). Various parties have long held this opinion regarding the swift unfreezing of Chinese property frozen by U.S. banks for the purpose of aiding the war effort, such as the National Political Council, which also made such a proposal. This proposal by Chongqing government figures such as He Yingqin deserves serious attention. According to the proposal, the names of account holders and the amounts of deposits should be published first, but if key Chongqing figures, especially the so-called Song family, such as Zhu Ziwu, Li Xiangxi, and Song Ziwen, have transferred their assets to the United States to seek preservation since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, then if the United States publishes names and amounts according to this proposal, it can reveal the unpatriotic behavior of key Chongqing figures. It is expected that the United States will publish a small portion of account holder names as a perfunctory gesture, and the fact that this proposal was put forward by He Yingqin and others also shows that friction has arisen again within the Chongqing political circles.

### The Rampancy of the Xiantian Dao Cult; Jiangsu Provincial Government Takes Comprehensive Measures

Central News Agency Dispatch from Suzhou, 19th: The Jiangsu Provincial Government previously ordered the dissolution of the Xiantian Dao because it used heretical teachings to bewitch the masses, and instructed local authorities to comply. However, recently, the actions of the Xiantian Dao cultists have become increasingly intensified. In order to maintain local security, a plan for suppressing Xiantian Dao has been specially formulated and distributed to various departments for implementation. The main purpose is to adopt a principle of comprehensive action, on the one hand, suppressing the key figures of the Xiantian Dao, and on the other hand, advising the deceived masses to awaken and be vigilant. At the same time, the government is authorized to deploy police and security forces under its jurisdiction, together with local troops, to conduct thorough suppression, on the one hand, cutting off planned areas, and on the other hand, strictly prohibiting cities, towns, and villages from manufacturing swords for heretics. Reward and punishment measures are also formulated to allow the public to have a way to correct their mistakes and start anew.

### Ministry of Education Reports on Administrative Situation

Central News Agency Dispatch from Nanjing, 19th: The Ministry of Education received Chinese and foreign reporters at 3:00 PM on the 19th, and Director Zhu Yu of the Higher Education Department reported on the ministry's recent administration as follows: 1.

This matter has been communicated by the Ministry to the provincial and municipal governments for their information. 4. (Supplementary Examinations for Students of National Universities) The original purpose of the Ministry's spot checks was to examine students' true regular performance in various subjects, as a basis for promoting teaching effectiveness. In the future, the regulations for spot checks will be held at any time. 5. Separate communications to various provinces and cities to hold exhibitions of works by students of vocational schools, 6. Returning to India in 1946 to explain the civil service, etc., explained in great detail, until about 5 o'clock before finishing.

### France Sends Reinforcements to Syria; Syrian Government Lodges Strong Protest

Central News Agency Dispatch from Lisbon, 19th: According to a United Press message from Beirut, several groups of French reinforcements suddenly went to Syria, causing the Syrian government to lodge a strong protest. The Syrian Prime Minister has announced that French troops have arrived in Syria. Political circles in various countries hope that Syria and Lebanon should directly consult the Arab League.

Central News Agency Dispatch from Lisbon, 19th: A dispatch from Beirut states that before the French government began negotiations with the Syrian and Lebanese governments, in order to show strength, the cruiser "Jeanne d'Arc" arrived in Beirut on the 17th and ordered 500 soldiers to begin landing. Shops on the central streets of Beirut closed one after another to show their resistance to the landing of French troops. Lebanese Prime Minister Jamilah stated in the lower house on the 17th that the Lebanese government had received informal notification regarding the landing of French troops, but if the French army divides the sovereignty of the country, the government is determined not to avoid any agency and to deal with it.

### Part of the U.S. Occupation Zone in Germany Transferred to France

Central News Agency Dispatch from Lisbon, 19th: According to messages received here, the United States is willing to transfer part of the U.S. occupation zone in Germany to France. The U.S. authorities have notified French Foreign Minister Bidault and Ambassador to the United States Bonnet of this intention. At the same time, news that has already been confirmed can also be obtained from President Truman's speech in Washington. Truman indicated that he would meet with Tagore and at the same time could declare the United States' willingness to transfer part of the U.S. occupation zone within its territory to France, because the United States believes that France can solve various issues concerning the interests of Europe.

### Divergent Opinions Among Countries at San Francisco Conference; Intense Debate Over Trusteeship Issues

Central News Agency Dispatch from Tokyo, 19th: The American media described the increasingly difficult situation at the San Francisco Conference as follows:

The U.S. delegation attending the San Francisco Conference is prepared to sever relations with the Soviet Union if necessary, and they suggest that if the world alliance this time cannot guarantee that small and weak countries will not be attacked by force, each small country should have the right to organize all mutual defense fronts. However, the Soviet Union expressed opposition to this proposal. If the various U.S. plans cannot form an international alliance agreement, it is expected that the Security Council cannot resolve all disputes, and the world security guarantee mechanism will not trust the power of the Congress. At the same time, the Soviet Union also opposed the proposal to allow small countries to obtain security by force within the specified restricted area. On the contrary, the Soviet Union's proposal that the people of the colonies should be free and independent under international rule was also vehemently refuted by the British and Americans.

Central News Agency Dispatch from Lisbon, 19th: San Francisco Dispatch: The international trusteeship issue seemed to be on the right track after the Stettinius draft was written, but unexpectedly, when it was first proposed for discussion at the committee meeting on the 17th, the opinion was divided again due to the proposal to amend the Chongqing representative. The Chongqing representative proposed that the purpose of the trusteeship system should be to enable all non-independent nations to achieve independence, while the British and American countries opposed the use of the word "(independence)". Stettinius declared to the representatives of various countries that the basic document of the trusteeship case represents the maximum scope agreed upon by the major countries, but the Chongqing amendment proposal has exceeded this limit.

Central News Agency Dispatch from Stockholm, 19th: The London (non-partisan) weekly newspaper analyzes in detail the motives for the repeated conflicts between Western European countries and the Soviet Union in diplomacy as follows: The current Soviet diplomacy is focusing all its efforts on establishing an eastern orderly central ocean peninsula extending to the Adriatic coast. The large defense fortress line. Standing will be of great importance to the northern part of the Soviet Union, and the Trotskyist disturbances will be a major secret fortress in the south. The demand for each field is nothing more than thinking about expanding the defense line. At present, the Soviet Union is trying its best to instigate the autonomy and independence of small countries, and to promote nationalism. The Nanjing Slavic macro world of the Soviet Union is actively advocating that the Trotskyist disturbances and Carinthia cannot be merged into one. Austria has also proposed that it should obtain all the land of Italian Tyrol, and Poland also wants to expand its territory to the Warta River and the Neisse River, while Koenigsberg is formally the soil of the Soviet Union. If you ask which country the construction industry of this strategic bunker will resist? It is extremely obvious that the Soviet Union fears the formation of the only large-scale (anti-Soviet group). Germany may be the wise man who sees wisdom in the group. The current policy of state-owned enterprises not only reveals a kind of fear, but also symbolizes the dizziness after victory. The foreign policy between the anti-Axis countries is launching a new stage full of political conflicts, that is, suppression and anti-suppression. This new stage is also establishing a so-called (new world political balance).

### Citizens Should Exert All Efforts to Strengthen Baojia Work; Baojia Propagandist Chen Riping Broadcasts

Chen Riping, a Baojia propagandist in the urban area, delivered a speech titled "Strengthening Baojia to Cooperatively Defend" at the Shanghai Radio Station at 8:00 PM on the 19th. The original text is as follows:

A few years ago in Shanghai, cases of robbery, assassination, and extortion occurred frequently, day and night. Since the establishment of the Baojia system and the organization of self-defense corps, all undesirable elements have had no place to hide, so such incidents have gradually decreased and are now rare. Although it can be said that considerable progress has been made, we cannot therefore neglect preventive measures. Especially in today's rapidly changing war situation, local security must be given more attention, so strengthening Baojia is an urgent matter. Since we already have a considerable understanding of the functions of Baojia, how to promote Baojia work to the point of perfection, so that it can exert greater effectiveness, should be considered a very important matter for all citizens.

Regarding Baojia, the authorities have already decided that in the future, important Baojia personnel will be selected through public recommendation, so that outstanding and impartial individuals can be elected to take on the work, making the Baojia organization even more complete. However, we hope that all Baojia personnel will work with impartiality, selflessness, and a spirit of prioritizing the greater good over individual interests, and not consider the matter unrelated to themselves and do things perfunctorily. It should be known that the Baojia organization is the foundation of people's self-governance and self-defense, and is a matter closely related to everyone. In peacetime, they must assist the police in clearing household registrations, assisting traffic, cooperating in fire prevention, paying attention to cleanliness and hygiene, and all administrative matters related to the public, in order to maintain local order, and enforce laws and regulations, prevent hoarding and speculation, and report illegal activities, so that the true meaning of Baojia can be achieved.

As mentioned above, in today's increasingly severe war situation, in addition to security, work such as air raid evacuation, rationing, and relief should also be taken into consideration. If the Baojia is densely and meticulously organized, and the self-defense corps is well-organized, it will be of great help in assisting the military and police. The complete preparation of the self-defense corps can not only maintain local security and all order, but also serve as a way for citizens to protect themselves and their families. Therefore, on the one hand, we hope that the Baojia and self-defense corps will strictly abide by discipline and fulfill their responsibilities; on the other hand, citizens should do their best to support and care for them, so that the Baojia can be strengthened and assist the military and police in all defense work during wartime and peacetime, while also providing various kinds of assistance to the people.
