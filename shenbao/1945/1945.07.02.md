Now, in light of the current war situation and various issues arising, we have come to Japan for consultations with the Japanese government. I am extremely pleased to have the opportunity to personally express my gratitude in my capacity as President of the Philippine Republic for the tolerance, inclusiveness, and profound kindness of the Japanese government. I and my delegation are deeply moved and grateful to have been granted an audience by His Majesty the Emperor. I will never forget the inspiring words His Majesty bestowed upon us. I also express my sincere gratitude for the heartfelt welcome and understanding of the Prime Minister and other ministers, as well as all the Japanese leaders. Under the current military situation, I firmly believe that not only the Philippine Republic, but also the nations that make up Greater East Asia and the oppressed peoples of the world, will eventually achieve freedom and independence.

### Japan Will Exhibit Total Strength in the Absolute Superiority of Decisive Battle on Home Soil

Tokyo, 1st (Central News Agency) – If we review the past operations of the enemy forces, we can see that they believe that once the objective of advancing their bases has been achieved, they will shift to new targets without waiting for the end of the land war. This is an unchangeable strategy of the American military. Therefore, what strategy will the enemy adopt after the Battle of Okinawa? It is likely to be one of three options: advancing bases, launching a landing operation on the Chinese mainland, or directly attacking the Japanese mainland. In any case, the enemy will undoubtedly intensify air raids and bombings, and forcibly blockade the coast. It cannot be denied that the end of the land war in Okinawa has marked the beginning of a new phase.

National War for Final Victory

The decisive battle on Japanese soil is the final battle. In other words, it is a battle that will determine the survival of the Japanese nation, a battle for Japan's self-preservation. Therefore, we must resolutely rise up to overcome all obstacles in our path. The wars in various parts of Greater East Asia are closely related to the defense of the Japanese homeland, which cannot be denied. The war on Japanese soil is not just a war fought by the military, but a national war in which 100 million citizens unite to defend the nation and its territory, and to strive for final victory. This is its greatest feature. In the decisive battle on home soil, there is no distinction between the front lines and the rear. All 100 million citizens will follow the brave and unparalleled Imperial Army, serving as production soldiers, transportation soldiers, and communications soldiers, and engage in the war effort. Therefore, the National Volunteer Corps and the National War Corps are of great significance. The recent frequent enemy air raids and indiscriminate bombings across various regions are merely attempts to cut off Japan's connection with the South and the Chinese mainland, isolate the Japanese economy, or conduct ideological warfare.

Fully Utilize Lessons from Okinawa

The war leaders of the enemy Americans also deeply understand that the Japanese are not a people who can be easily subdued. In order to achieve their great goal of destroying Japan, they will ultimately land on Japanese soil and engage in a desperate battle with the Japanese army. This is very clear. This ambition of the enemy Americans has not only been stated by Truman, but it is also the inevitable outcome given the nature of this war. However, we have long been fully aware of the enemy's intentions, and we deeply understand that the decisive battle on home soil will determine our fate. All 100 million citizens have the ambition to fight the enemy with the same hatred and resentment, to defeat the enemy that dares to land, and to achieve final victory. If so, how should we destroy the enemy's forces when we launch the decisive battle on home soil? In short, the decisive battle on home soil is completely different from the previous island-hopping operations. In the latter, the enemy took the offensive, while we only adopted a defensive posture. This time, however, we will launch an offensive against the enemy and seize the initiative. In other words, we must understand that the decisive battle on home soil is the final battle, and that all the lessons and hints learned from the Battle of Okinawa should be fully utilized in the future. If the enemy attempts to attack, our army and navy will not wait for the enemy to act first. Army Minister Anami stated this at a recent session of the extraordinary Diet. If the enemy invades our homeland, we will first use our air force and naval vessels, especially special attack units, to launch a fierce attack at sea and destroy them. Furthermore, we will attack the coastline with air force, special naval attack units, and coastal artillery. Even if the enemy manages to land, Japan will use its elite field army to destroy their entire force. Regarding the absolute superiority and inevitable victory in the tactics of the decisive battle on home soil, the following points can be summarized:

Fully Utilize Elite Forces

Japanese military strength enjoys absolute superiority. Since the Battle of Guadalcanal, in island warfare, Japanese forces have been isolated and unable to do anything but use their available combat power to resist the concentrated attacks of the overwhelmingly superior enemy. However, in the decisive battle on home soil, the situation is completely reversed. Against the enemy forces that cross the Pacific to invade the Japanese mainland, the Japanese side is fully prepared to continuously attack with its elite forces. US President Truman has stated that 7 million soldiers will be mobilized for the war against Japan. This is nothing more than a deceitful propaganda tactic by the enemy, intending to use the pressure of this number to confuse the Japanese people. From this, we can further discern that the enemy is currently anxious about the lengthening of their supply lines and the shortage of transport ships. Conversely, Japan has no such worries. This can be seen from what Army Minister Anami pointed out, (we currently possess elite land forces numbering several million). Furthermore, the National Volunteer Combat Teams formed under the recently enacted (Volunteer Military Service Law) are specifically tasked with rear support duties. This is an advantage in the decisive battle on home soil. In battles fought outside of the homeland, rear support duties are mostly borne by the military. However, in the decisive battle on home soil, these important rear support duties will be borne by the combat teams, so all military forces can be deployed to the front lines. The ability to utilize all forces is an absolute advantage in the battle on home soil.

Secure Terrain and Reinforcements

The terrain of the homeland favors our side. In wartime, one must be familiar with the terrain and features of the battlefield. In the decisive battle on home soil, not only mountains, rivers, forests, and roads, but even every blade of grass and tree can be turned into combat power. Utilizing the terrain and features provides essential maneuverability on the inside lines. If this can be maximized, it can be used to launch concentrated attacks against the enemy's superior forces, allowing the traditional maneuverability of the Japanese army to be fully utilized. An unprecedented field battle, unseen since the Japanese-American war, will encircle and annihilate the enemy. Furthermore, looking back at the previous island-hopping operations, the most difficult aspect for Japan was its supply capacity. This situation will inevitably shift to the enemy. From our extremely advantageous position of having the battlefield as our supply base, we will be able to fully supply the front lines in a timely manner with weapons, ammunition, food, and other supplies. Although it is expected that the enemy will attempt to thoroughly bomb railways, communications lines, and destroy bridges, materials for repairing damaged critical transportation lines have already been prepared. In the unlikely event that repairs are difficult, we will be able to utilize mountains, fields, and rivers to secure the advantage of reinforcements and supplies to counter the enemy. At the same time, due to the influence of different climates and environments, the physical and mental strength of our soldiers will be greatly enhanced, which will have a significant impact on our ability to sustain the war. (Prolonged war) is something that the enemy fears and worries about, but it is our greatest expectation.

Conduct the Decisive Battle with New Weaponry

We will devote the total scientific power of Japan and deploy aerial, naval, and land-based new weaponry, as well as Japan's unique strong spirit, scientific power, special attack weapons, and other total forces in this decisive battle, in order to gain an absolutely advantageous position. 4. In terms of troop strength and equipment, although the Japanese army has suffered setbacks in the Pacific counteroffensive operations since Guadalcanal due to the inferiority of numbers, in this decisive battle on home soil, the superiority of quantity and its position are exactly the opposite. In future operations, we will definitely overcome the enemy with superior numbers. Furthermore, once the homeland becomes a battlefield, the entire population of 100 million, from government officials to ordinary citizens, will unite as one. What we saw in Okinawa (to defend to the death), (to protect our homeland), is truly the concentration of the national spirit of loyalty and sincerity. In short, in the decisive battle on home soil, we will exert the greatest function of our total strength, and with the united hatred of the enemy from top to bottom, we will inflict painful damage on the enemy and force them to retreat in defeat.

Editorial

### On the War for Peace and Justice: Reflections on Ambassador Tani's Speech

Ambassador Tani, the Japanese envoy to China, gave a speech to the press corps of this city, providing candid and concrete answers to several major issues of utmost concern to our people. Aside from objectively criticizing the United Nations' so-called (International Security Organization), aligning with our consistent stance, Ambassador Tani also offered noteworthy clarifications on recent peace rumors, Sino-Japanese relations, and the National Government's rice policy. After discussing this, we had some thoughts to share:

Regarding peace rumors, Ambassador Tani clarified that Japan's attitude toward peace was fully expressed in the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty and the Greater East Asia Conference's Joint Declaration. Furthermore, Prime Minister Suzuki also recently expressed a clear attitude on this matter. Ambassador Tani believes that while some may not yet understand Japan's attitude, the evolution of the war will awaken them to the shared interests of East Asia. The proliferation of discussions on peace proves the existence of those who care about the future of East Asia. Ambassador Tani further stated clearly: (As for Japan, the door to peace has not been closed, but it depends on whether the other party is willing to step through the door. This is a crucial point).

The door to peace that Japan has not closed is very open, as repeatedly demonstrated by Japanese authorities regarding the objectives of the Greater East Asia War: to seek political equality for all East Asian nations, economic reciprocity, cultural respect for inherent values, and the preservation of each nation's sovereignty. We must recognize that if these conditions are met, peace will be fully realized, and the objectives of the Greater East Asia War will be fully achieved. Therefore, in the war against the great powers, especially British and American imperialism, war and peace are two completely different things. However, the Greater East Asia War is a war for peace and justice, a war for national liberation. As long as the just objectives are achieved, we can immediately step through the door to peace. Conversely, without justice, without political equality, economic reciprocity, and cultural respect for the inherent values of East Asian nations, any (peace) is not what we want to hear.

We are a peace-loving nation. The National Government has established (peace) and anti-communism as fundamental national policies. Our ultimate goal in participating in the Greater East Asia War is to seek a just peace to realize an East Asia for East Asians. Today, the enemy is preparing its largest offensive against the Japanese mainland and the Chinese mainland. Although Britain and America lack the sincerity to step through the door to just peace, we can only more firmly cooperate with Japan and use our own flesh and blood to fight for a just peace.

In this most critical phase of the war, the cooperative relationship between China and Japan is the main issue in achieving the objectives of the East Asia War and fighting for a just peace. In this speech, Ambassador Tani said: (If cooperation is desired in anything, regardless of the nature of the cooperation, as long as the parties involved truly have a genuine understanding, the cooperation will be meaningful). Today, there is no doubt about the (genuine understanding) between the two sides. This (genuine understanding) is not just empty theory, but must be expressed in facts, must be expressed in solving the practical and urgent problems of both sides. We have repeatedly pointed out that China's most pressing problem today is improving the people's livelihood, especially solving the food problem. The implementation of the National Government's emergency measures regarding rice and the assistance provided by the allies, in our view, are a concrete manifestation of what Ambassador Tani calls (genuine understanding). Most touching is that Ambassador Tani frankly stated when discussing this issue: (It is not yet known whether the National Government authorities have new planning methods regarding the newly discovered rice production, but it is believed that the National Government will be able to adapt to the environment and have a proper plan, and Japan will, of course, continue to cooperate at that time). This is also (genuine understanding), which will (make cooperation more meaningful).

We have consistently maintained that there is no difficulty between China and Japan that cannot be overcome and resolved. The prerequisite for resolution is a deep understanding and close cooperation among the Chinese and Japanese authorities and the Chinese people. This is true for resolving the problems of the Chinese people's food and livelihood in the future, and it is also true for Sino-Japanese cooperation in the decisive battle to achieve a just peace.

### War Situation in Various Parts of East Asia

Tokyo, 1st - Central News Agency dispatch: In the Okinawa area, the battle in the southern island area of Okinawa Island has inflicted great damage on the enemy and is now in its final stages. In the mountainous area of the northern part of the island, a part of the Japanese army continues to fight back. The enemy is now focusing all its efforts on expanding and preparing the Okinawa land base, continuously opening up convoy groups and replenishing resources. On the 25th, there was a fleet of about 200 ships near Ryukyu. The Japanese air force attacked them for several days, achieving considerable results, greatly undermining the enemy's attempts. This week, the enemy landed on Kume Island to strengthen the outer airport. In the Mariana and Ogasawara areas, the enemy air force in Mariana, as in the past week, attacked industrial facilities near small and medium-sized cities in the Japanese mainland, and dropped torpedoes and incendiary bombs in various directions, frequently conducting reconnaissance in various places. This phenomenon is quite noteworthy. The U.S. Air Force has used Iwo Jima as a temporary landing site, which has been quite effective. The Japanese Air Force attacked the airport on the 23rd, causing fires in four places. In the Southwest Pacific, the war in Borneo and Halmahera is quite active. Enemy ships are still carrying out mine sweeping operations against Balikpapan. The Japanese air force squadron is fighting them. The Ternate Island front in the Halmahera region is in a stalemate. In Luzon, around June 21, the enemy's 11th Airborne Division landed near Aparri at the northern end of the island, and then gradually moved south. In response, the 32nd and 25th Divisions suffered heavy casualties from the Japanese army's fierce attacks. The 37th Division is retreating steadily and is currently engaged in fierce battles. Around June 23, the enemy invaded to about 20 kilometers south of San Pablo. Japanese troops launched fierce battles against the enemy forces attacking from the north and south. The Japanese troops in the mountainous area east of Manila are still fighting bravely. In Burma, due to the rainy season, the roads are muddy, and the fighting between the two sides has stalled. The Japanese army, taking advantage of the mountain dangers to resist the enemy, launched fierce battles on the highlands and is currently preventing the enemy from advancing south.

### U.S. Military Admits Heavy Damage in Okinawa Operations

Zurich, 1st - Central News Agency dispatch: NATO reports and the press recently sent personnel from Guam to describe the situation in Okinawa as follows: Since the Pearl Harbor operation, the U.S. military has never suffered such heavy damage. The U.S. military did not pay attention to the Japanese army absorbing Okinawan people to serve as reservists, which increased the military strength. Their bravery and combat skills are no less than those of soldiers. Buckner admitted that he had underestimated the Japanese military strength, saying that the defensive positions were too stubborn, which delayed the Okinawa operation. In the future, Buckner will continue to supplement the U.S. military, so that the divisions can continue to fight. The U.S. military is standing in front of the Baling of the city of Shuri, and the remaining remnants are numerous. The 96th Division suffered the most damage, and the 77th and 27th Divisions of the U.S. military also suffered great damage.

### Top Financial Authorities Talk About Cracking Down on Cash Discounting and Investigating and Prohibiting Banks from Profiteering from Cash and Issuing Allocation Orders

Regarding the issue of cash, the top financial authorities issued a statement as follows:

Recently, the issue of cash discounts has become increasingly serious. The general public does not understand the truth and attributes it to the insufficient supply of Central Reserve Bank cash, and even claims that the Central Reserve Bank deliberately created this situation so that employees can profit from it. I have decided to take full responsibility for this issue and thoroughly eliminate the source to reduce it.

Reasons for Insufficient Cash in Circulation

The occurrence of cash discounts is of course due to the insufficient cash in circulation on the market. The reasons for insufficient cash in circulation are as follows: 1. Prices continue to rise, and the demand for cash increases. 2. During the current period of purchasing agricultural products, due to restrictions on remittances to the interior, it is necessary to carry cash to purchase, which promotes the outflow of cash. 3. Although the Central Reserve Bank distributes a large amount of cash to various banks daily, some banks do not fully pay it to depositors, but only seek to profit from it. But there is a most important reason that is overlooked by the general public, namely, the abuse of allocation orders. An allocation order is a type of check issued by a bank to the Central Reserve Bank, the Bankers' Association, or the Native Bankers' Association to pay funds. It is conventionally called an allocation order. Because the issuer of the allocation order is a bank and the payer is the Central Reserve Bank, the Bankers' Association, or the Native Bankers' Association, the general public believes that there is no bounced check, so they are happy to accept it. Most of the large transactions on the market rely on allocation orders for settlement. The credit of allocation orders is too good, so some bad banks can use allocation orders to create the funds they need. The results of this audit found that the amount of allocation orders issued by the bank exceeded its total deposits by four or five times, and the amount exceeding the total positions of the Bankers' Association reached more than thirty times. The daily development of allocation orders, totaling about 12 million yuan for banks and native banks (excluding formal exchange banks), although not all are bad checks, compared with the overall positions of each bank in the Bankers' Association or the Native Bankers' Association, the daily development of empty capital averages more than four or five times its actual positions. The expansion of credit positions is really frightening. These empty funds circulate on the market every day. If a part of them is exchanged for cash, the amount of cash paid by the Central Reserve Bank daily will not be enough to cope with the discount, how can this phenomenon not occur? Not only does it cause cash to be scarce and discounts to occur, but it also drives up prices. We often think that the rise in prices is due to inflation, but since inflation is increasing day by day, cash should not feel its lack. Today's phenomenon is that prices are rising day by day, and cash is becoming increasingly insufficient. From this, it can be known that the excessive expansion of this contradictory credit position is the reason for it. Banks issue allocation orders without needing to fully prepare positions. Stocks, gold bars, or goods worth several millions of yuan can be easily obtained with a piece of empty allocation order. The rise in prices is becoming more and more intense. In other words, each bank can issue huge amounts of banknotes without limit, and the responsibility for cashing the banknotes is entirely borne by the Central Reserve Bank. If this continues, no matter how much cash is supplied, the discount will be difficult to reduce, and price increases will be rampant. The crisis of Shanghai's financial economy will inevitably become more and more serious, and it will be irretrievable.

Resolutely Prevent the Expansion of Credit Positions

Therefore, it has been decided to completely stop the issuance of allocation orders to prevent the expansion of credit positions. The banking industry decided to implement it on July 3 and stop using it altogether. In the future, empty funds will gradually shrink, the discount will gradually decrease, and prices will become stable. Other issues such as the easing of remittance restrictions and the prohibition of private transportation of cash are also being studied and improved. As for the general bad banks, such as those who have profited from cash in the past or abused the issuance of allocation orders and promissory notes, exceeding their strength to engage in hoarding and speculation, they will be severely punished and their business will be suspended.

The Practice of Discounting Must be Eradicated

As for the cash that is needed daily, the Central Reserve Bank will supply it as much as possible to ensure that there is no shortage. In the future, the practice of discounting must be eradicated. Banks must provide convenience to the people who need cash as much as possible. This has been notified by the Central Reserve Bank to various banks to follow. The police have been ordered to strictly crack down on the evil practice of discounting. All of our people must understand the current situation, understand the intentions of the authorities, and never suffer unnecessary losses or touch the law. As for the employees of the Central Reserve Bank, it is rumored that they are charging discounts. I have strictly prohibited it. If this happens again, the people are allowed to complain. The police have been dispatched to secretly investigate. Once verified, they will be punished twice as severely and will never be tolerated.

### Last Week's Financial and Industrial Market Conditions Were Stable; Authorities Strictly Cracked Down on Illegal Transactions

The financial and industrial market conditions in Shanghai last week were calm amidst the international situation, and the government strictly cracked down on illegal transactions, so the general speculative market could not stir up trouble. At the same time, the authorities cracked down on allocation order discounts, scheduled to stop the issuance of allocation orders by various banks, and the banks handled semi-annual settlements at the end of June, tightening mortgage lending and other reasons, so the market situation has stabilized, the process is stable, and new highs have not been achieved. The transaction volume seems to be lower than the previous week, and silver has not changed much. From Monday to Saturday, the Chinese stock market hovered low and flat. Mei Ya retreated into the 8,000 yuan level, and Yong'an Spinning Mill and Company also fell in step. Small and medium-sized stocks were all weak and sluggish. Buyers were very weak, and sellers were actually the majority. It was difficult to revive people's hearts for a while. Most investors shifted their targets to the new trading of the gold securities market on July 3. As for industry and commerce, there were no changes in a week. Factories in various industries are still subject to power restrictions, and production is difficult to improve for a while. The prices of goods sold in various companies and shops are rarely awarded, and the price of rice is allowed to be freely transported by the government, and the source has slightly increased. The price of each stone fell back to about 100,000 yuan per day. New wheat has been launched, and the flour association is actively carrying out purchasing work. The designated flour mills are also preparing to start producing flour, which can remedy the shortage of rice supply, and the panic of people's food can be gradually eliminated. The rising prices of other grains, oil, and sugar have stopped, but daily necessities such as soap, matches, and fuel continue to rise.

### Establishment of the Special Gold Tax Collection Committee

To manage the gold trade in this city in a proper manner, the Municipal Government previously formulated measures for managing gold trading firms. These measures were submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval and promulgation. All gold trading businesses in the city, whether operating independently or acting as agents, were required to truthfully report to the Finance and Economic Bureaus from June 19th to June 29th, a period of ten days, in accordance with the law, if they were already members of the guild. At the same time, to augment the municipal treasury, the Finance Bureau was authorized to levy a special tax on gold starting July 1st. The Finance Bureau has appointed relevant personnel to form the Municipal Special Gold Tax Collection Committee, with Sun Dong as the chairman. The committee was established yesterday (the 1st) in Room 230 on the third floor of the Municipal Government Building to begin tax collection work.

### North Railway Station Police Bureau: Purchasing Train Tickets on Behalf

Since the implementation of emergency measures for the control of rice and grain, the number of passengers traveling alone on various passenger trains at the North Railway Station has suddenly increased more than threefold. As a result, the flow of passengers is frequent, and those queuing to purchase tickets face extreme congestion and difficulty. Now, the chief of the North Railway Station Branch of the Municipal Police Bureau, in order to facilitate elderly, female, and child passengers, has negotiated this matter with the North Railway Station authorities, and the outcome has been very satisfactory. It is understood that the general approach is that elderly individuals over the age of sixty, young children, and pregnant women can directly inquire at the North Railway Station information desk to request assistance with purchasing train tickets, or they can directly request the North Railway Station Police Branch to purchase tickets on their behalf. In addition, in cases of urgent matters such as weddings or funerals that require immediate ticket purchases, a certificate can be obtained from the Lianbao chief in their respective residential areas, and the same method can be used to request assistance with purchasing tickets. It is also understood that the bureau is determined to eradicate unscrupulous individuals who extort passengers under the pretext of inspection at the North Railway Station. Passengers who discover such behavior can report it to the bureau at any time with accurate details.

### Baojia Clerks' Class: Graduation Ceremony Held Yesterday

Yesterday (the 1st) at 10:00 AM, a graduation ceremony was held at St. John's University. Director Gu of the Baojia Office, the chiefs of the Changning and Huashan branch bureaus, and over 120 trainees attended. First, Director Liu of the training class reported on the training process. Then, Director Gu delivered a speech, encouraging the trainees with the three points of "understanding right and wrong," "taking responsibility," and "upholding justice." Trainee representative Lin Runsheng gave a response. Finally, certificates and awards were presented, and a group photo was taken.

Brief Commentary

### After Reading Remarks by Financial Authorities

The highest financial authorities recently issued statements addressing the current discount on cash and general financial abnormalities. We can summarize the following points:

The authorities attribute the problem of cash discounts to the Central Bank, as well as to employees profiting from it, and have decided to take responsibility for thoroughly eliminating the source. This is welcome news to our citizens.

Although some unscrupulous banks and financial institutions do not fully pay depositors when distributing cash from the Central Bank, according to financial circles, formal member money shops receive only a very small amount of cash daily, making it practically impossible to cope. However, a few informal small money shops have great connections and can issue large amounts of cash. We believe that in the future, the Central Bank's distribution of cash to banks and financial institutions should be public, reasonable, and even, so that unscrupulous banks and financial institutions cannot secretly profit.

The excessive issuance of appropriation orders is a major cause of the cash discount, with the average amount of overdraft capital being four to five times the actual available funds. As a result, unscrupulous banks and financial institutions can use a single worthless appropriation order to exchange for a large value of stocks, gold bars, or other goods, achieving their speculative profit-making goals. This abnormal phenomenon is a very dangerous path leading to financial collapse. Although the authorities are now trying to stop it, the public has already suffered from the rampant issuance of appropriation orders, followed by soaring prices, especially for food, and then by the rampant discount on cash. We have learned a painful lesson and believe that all economic pathologies can be estimated based on theoretical and empirical deductions from their inception. At the beginning of the excessive issuance of appropriation orders, no one pointed out the crisis, and the few financial leaders who were actually responsible concealed the situation from the authorities, failing to prevent it in a timely manner, which led to its worsening. In the future, the functions of inspection and supervision should be strengthened, and research and investigation work should be improved, accepting expert opinions and preparing to prevent financial phenomena that may have adverse consequences as early as possible.

Now that the authorities have found that some banks and financial institutions have engaged in illegal activities, they should be severely punished. However, we hope that the illegal banks and financial institutions will be publicly announced, otherwise, it will not be enough to deter others and warn future offenders.

### Strictly Prohibit Bark Strippers

— Wei Leng

Many French parasol trees are planted on both sides of the streets in the eighth district of this city. At this time of the hot summer, the dense green shade provides shelter for pedestrians, saving them from the scorching sun. Moreover, this type of broad-leaved plant exchanges gases with the outside world frequently, which is very beneficial to human health as it regulates the content of water and oxygen in the atmosphere. As for beautifying the city, that is an added benefit. Along Taisan Road, Daxing Road, Changxing Road, and various cross streets intersecting with these roads, there are lush roadside trees standing alongside, the smaller ones being ten or so years old, and the larger ones having weathered dozens of winters and summers. The trunks are several arm spans around, and the branches and leaves intersect above the road, making pedestrians feel as if they are entering a deep forest. In the past, the French were able to cherish and protect them. Every winter, they would wrap the branches of the weaker ones with straw, and only remove it in the following summer, fearing that the cambium layer would be invaded by the cold and die. Now that the concession has been recovered, we should consider how to plant more roadside trees and protect the existing forests to further beautify them in our hands, silencing those Westerners who look down on the Chinese people. Unexpectedly, today, poor women and children are allowed to strip the bark off the roadside trees. The bark is to a tree what clothing is to a person. If all the bark is stripped off, how will these trees, deprived of their protective clothing, survive the winter? Furthermore, the growth of tree branches and trunks depends entirely on the cambium layer. This layer, less than a millimeter thick, is located under the outer bark. Once the outer bark is removed, the phloem tissue, which is thin, cannot protect the cambium layer. If the cambium layer dies, the entire tree dies. If we cut off a ring of both the inner and outer bark layers of a tree trunk (the outer bark is the phellem layer, and the inner bark is composed of the phloem layer and the cambium. The cambium is only two cells thick. The inner cells divide to form xylem, and the outer cells divide to form phloem. Xylem is specifically for transporting water from the roots to the leaves, and phloem is specifically for transporting organic matter, such as sugar, starch, fat, and protein, produced by the leaves, from the leaves to the roots.) about half an inch wide, the part of the tree above the ring will always be particularly prosperous for a year, but will completely die in the following year, without exception. This is because the roots have no storage of organic nutrients and starve to death. Today, ignorant women and children are stripping the bark, and people in the city regard it as if they do not see it. They do not understand the principles of plant growth, thinking that removing a thin layer of bark from a large tree trunk will not cause any damage, not knowing that once this outer bark is removed, the part of the plant that it relies on to live and grow loses its ability to resist the severe cold, and most of it will die. Moreover, if the trend of bark stripping continues, the outer bark can be stripped, and the inner bark can also be stripped. Police and pedestrians will become accustomed to it and will not think it strange. Trees that have grown for decades will be destroyed in a day. How can our government authorities not feel regret? In recent days, the author has passed through various roads in the eighth district and has tried to dissuade women and children from stripping bark, but cannot stop this bad trend. Now, the Municipal Government has issued a clear order strictly prohibiting it, but the police force may not be able to reach everywhere, so the responsibility should be assigned to the self-defense team members to assist in the handling. As for those who live by the roadside and those who travel, everyone should be responsible for stopping the act of bark stripping, so that the trees that have not been stripped can be kept healthy, and those that have already been stripped should be required by the residents by the roadside to buy straw and wrap the tree trunks this winter, so that they do not all die. Those who watch the bark being stripped and do nothing have a very poor sense of public morality, and fining them with the responsibility of wrapping them is precisely to stimulate them so that they do not adopt a laissez-faire attitude in the future.

### Are You a "Lucky One"?

— Gao Ying

—Impressions of the Joint Graduation Ceremony of Municipal Schools—

Director Dai of the Education Bureau briefly reported the schools and number of students participating in this graduation ceremony before Secretary-General Luo delivered his speech. There were nine middle schools, two normal schools, and thirty-two primary schools. The number of graduates was 1,372 in primary schools (509 boys, 208 girls), 668 in middle schools (460 boys, 208 girls), and 81 in normal schools. The total number of participants was 2,040. In addition to Chinese students, there were also foreign students of various nationalities.

When Secretary-General Luo presented the certificates, representatives from four schools went on stage to receive them. The first was a primary school student wearing shorts and a sports shirt, vividly demonstrating the spirit of primary school students. The second representative was a middle school student wearing a dark blue linen long gown, fully showing the demeanor of a middle school student. In addition, there was a female representative and a foreign representative, also female. However, the former's body seemed far less robust than the latter's.

As the ceremony was about to end, all the students stood up and sang the graduation song, "The Huangpu River winds eastward, the Song River flows long, converging into a land of culture... Diligent students, becoming accomplished, come from all directions... Liberation, liberation, high-held banners, soar in the sky." The melody was uplifting and very moving.

Shortly after, this grand graduation ceremony ended. Secretary-General Luo, distinguished guests, and officials walked out of the venue in order, followed by more than two thousand students in orderly rows. Whether they will be able to continue their studies, or will be forced to drop out due to family economic circumstances, this mystery cannot be answered for the time being. What can be certain is that the financial burden on parents in the second semester of this year will definitely be heavier than in the first semester; and the male and female students who can continue their studies will become the even luckier among the lucky ones.

As I was about to walk out of the gate of the Great World, I saw the young men and women crowded in front of the ticket pre-sale counter, already naturally formed into a "queue," stretching their arms toward the glass window to pre-purchase movie tickets. The ticket seller was very focused and quick at stamping the date on a thick book of movie tickets. Undoubtedly, business was "very good." The price of movie tickets: 3,000 yuan for the grand hall, 2,500 yuan for the second hall, 2,000 yuan for the main hall. Estimated tuition fees for primary school in the second semester: 12,000 yuan for grades 5-6, 10,000 yuan for grades 3-4, 8,000 yuan for grades 1-2.

I inadvertently obtained the above two sets of figures. As Secretary-General Luo said, the two thousand primary and middle school students in the Great World yesterday were the lucky ones of the times, because they still have the ability to study and the blessing to graduate. Then, the young men and women standing at the ticket window must be the luckiest of the lucky ones. The reason seems to need not be stated.

Many ambitious young men and women hope to continue their studies next semester, but will their family circumstances allow it?

Young men and women who can afford to watch movies, can you restrain yourselves a little and help your contemporary young people who have the same passion and the same desire to improve themselves, but are struggling financially?

Walking out of the Great World, a child offered to sell me a small newspaper. I said, "Okay, I'll buy one." The following dialogue serves as the end of this article.

"How old are you?"

"Thirteen years old."

"Have you gone to school?"

"I went for two years."

"Is the newspaper business good?"

The child looked at his customer and stammered, "Today is my first day selling newspapers."

"Then why do you have to sell newspapers?"

"My father has passed away, and there's only my mother at home, working as a maid for others."

"How many have you sold?"

"So far, eight have been bought."

There was no need to ask any further questions. The child is called Fan Renyuan, from Pudong.

Thirteen years old - the age of learning to dance, isn't he a true standard school-age child? While this thousand or so students of the same age were participating in the graduation ceremony inside the Great World, he was selling newspapers at the entrance of the Great World, sustaining his little life.

Lucky ones, even luckier ones, helping others to study is a righteous act of chivalry. May I ask, are you one of the two? (End)

### This Office Sends Vaccines on Behalf: Donates to Charitable Organizations

This office received a letter from Zhonghe Jun yesterday, stating that, as it is the time of epidemic, he specifically donated 50 bottles of Grieg's cholera and typhoid mixed vaccine (40 cc per bottle), and entrusted us to distribute them to voluntary epidemic prevention groups and charitable organizations. Zhonghe Jun's attention to public welfare is admirable. It has been found that this vaccine will expire on the 15th of next month, so epidemic prevention groups and charitable organizations that need this product should send a letter to this office to receive it as soon as possible to avoid it expiring and becoming unusable. First come, first served, while supplies last.

Last month, this office received 50 free treatment vouchers for trauma from Lin Zhentang, which have already been given out. Many cases of trauma have been cured. Yesterday, another 100 vouchers were sent, entrusting us to distribute them. We are deeply grateful. These trauma vouchers are managed by Mr. Tong Zhongyi, a trauma specialist. The clinic is located at 23, Lane 124, Tongfu Road, Weihaiwei Road. The hours are from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM. Seriously ill patients are treated immediately. Trauma medicines and ointments needed after diagnosis can be provided free of charge. Lin Zhentang and Mr. Tong Zhongyi are enthusiastic about public welfare and are deeply admired. Those who are poor and sick can bring their residence permit to this office or to Houfeng Paperboard Company at 45, Tongchunfang, Baike Road, to collect the voucher nearby.

The Vocational Counseling Department of the Sichuan Road YMCA, in view of the fact that all schools are preparing for the start of the next semester, and the transfer of teaching staff is inevitable, is specifically conducting registration matters. All schools that need to hire various teachers and staff, or all teachers and staff who need to find other positions, are invited to go to the association for contact every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday afternoon.

### Viewing the Art Exhibition of the Deaf and Mute

— Wei

Mr. Gu Hoshi, a young man who is both deaf and mute, has studied painting since childhood. Now, with the cooperation of Xie Bosheng, Mai Yihua, Shen Zuyi, and others, he is publicly exhibiting many of his works in the hall of Nanyang Hospital on Luoyang Road. The "Deaf and Mute Art Exhibition" is a truly unique event. Beethoven's works became more divine after he went deaf in his later years. Mr. Gu Hoshi and others, with their innate imperfections, have instead been able to focus on the study of painting. Although their works have not yet reached the point of perfection, in the reporter's opinion, if given time, their future is very promising. Mr. Gu told the reporter that the purpose of this exhibition is to invite audiences with an artistic eye to visit and provide correct guidance and criticism.

Mr. Gu's works are mainly portraits and still lifes. His portrait of Ms. Li Xianglan, among others, is skillfully and maturely executed, reaching a refined state. The paintings "Apple and Cat," among others, have won awards in the YMCA Art Exhibition. The painting "Mother and Child" has a style similar to that of the French painter Millet, with simple lines and a well-studied perspective.

It is said that Mr. Gu Hoshi is a top student of the contemporary famous artist Gu Tingkang. No wonder his pastel paintings and oil paintings have a bright and beautiful feel in their use of colors and application of powder.
