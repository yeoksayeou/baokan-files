### Burmese Japanese Army Counterattacks and Recaptures Meiktila: Enemy's Rear Supply Line Cut Off

Burmese Front, 19th – Central News Agency dispatch: The Japanese army in the Meiktila area, in order to completely annihilate the strong enemy forces that invaded Meiktila to seize central Burma and retake Pegu, launched a simultaneous offensive on the 14th. Against the enemy forces that repeatedly attacked the Japanese army's positions with flamethrower tanks and medium tanks under air force cover, the Japanese launched a fierce counterattack and continued to carry out night attacks under strong artillery cover. They finally recaptured the Meiktila city streets, which had once fallen into enemy hands from the 14th to the 15th, and re-secured the vital point between Mandalay and Yangon. At the same time, a separate detachment surrounded and captured five airfields around the city, thus crushing the enemy's plan to build an air base in Meiktila, and their rear supply line was cut off. The enemy had previously used transport planes to supply the enemy forces around the city, but now they are in a state of panic due to the loss of landing points. However, because the enemy has consistently attempted to seize the East Airfield, several hundred enemy soldiers, with fifty tanks, attacked again on the 16th. The Japanese army firmly defended the north of the airfield and resisted, and since the 17th, a fierce attack has been launched on a part of the enemy forces at the East Airfield. At the same time, the Japanese army near the Irrawaddy River crossing point, in order to respond to this, began to advance on the enemy's rear.

### Eight Days of Continuous Street Fighting, Mandalay Turns to Scorched Earth

Burmese Front, 20th – Central News Agency dispatch: Since the enemy invaded the vicinity of Mandalay with strong forces, the Japanese garrison troops, in the scorched city, are filled with the undying spirit of destroying the enemy and continue to fight. Up to the 15th, after eight days of continuous street fighting, they inflicted heavy damage on the enemy.

### Japanese Army Secures Positions in Zamboanga

Philippine Front, 19th – Central News Agency dispatch: The Zamboanga Japanese garrison's army and navy units are exceptionally vigorous and brave, firmly defending their positions and inflicting heavy blows on the invading enemy forces. On the 17th, the enemy, under the cover of two tanks and multiple mortars, launched several attacks on the Japanese army's left-wing positions. After the Japanese garrison's heroic counterattack, they inflicted great damage on the enemy and drove them back. The Japanese army's right-wing positions in the Zamboanga riverbank area are also continuing to engage in fierce fighting with the enemy. Since the 16th, the enemy has repeatedly invaded the Japanese army's positions, and both sides have engaged in several fierce positional battles, but they have been repeatedly repelled by the Japanese garrison. In addition, a unit of the Japanese navy near the old airfield was trapped in a heavy enemy encirclement on the 16th. However, after the reinforcing army units engaged in a fierce battle with the enemy amidst a hail of bullets, they broke the encirclement and were able to safely secure their positions.

Philippine Front, 20th – Central News Agency dispatch: From the enemy's landing until the 15th, the Japanese army's battle results included killing and wounding 1,351 enemy soldiers, destroying ten barracks, burning five tanks, burning over 2,000 catties of food, and sinking four landing craft.

### Key Points for Township Associations to Handle Evacuation Work

— Chen Binhe

The Evacuation Committee convened representatives from various charitable organizations and township associations in the past two days to discuss the implementation of evacuation. Yesterday, the methods for charitable organizations to implement evacuation were discussed in detail. Now, further explanation is added regarding the evacuation matters handled by township associations as follows:

(1) Charitable organizations themselves are evacuees, while township associations themselves are not evacuees, but rather assist fellow villagers in evacuating. Therefore, the evacuation methods for the two are not entirely the same. It can also be said that the former is relatively simple, while the latter is more complex. The reason why the Evacuation Committee convened township associations for joint discussion is because township associations are originally groups of fellow villagers and have an original obligation to serve them. Moreover, township associations handling evacuation work for fellow villagers not only serve their fellow villagers but also assist the government in implementing policies. The Evacuation Committee has now stipulated that general public evacuation registration will begin on April 1st, handled in 18 districts according to the areas under the jurisdiction of the police stations. All township associations should immediately inform fellow villagers of all registration procedures and handle them in accordance with the regulations.

(2) Those evacuating back to their hometown must return their residence permits in exchange for movement permits and have the words "Returning Home" stamped by the competent authority. This has been clearly stipulated, and township associations should further inform evacuating fellow villagers that they must comply to avoid encountering difficulties due to non-compliance with procedures.

(3) In addition to the above two points, the main work of township associations is to provide economic assistance to poor fellow villagers who are evacuating back to their hometowns and to accept the Evacuation Committee's entrustment to handle special matters. As for evacuation transportation by vehicle or boat, the Evacuation Committee directly provides it. If township associations can arrange special boats or special vehicles for fellow villagers, they should reduce fees as a principle and obtain the permission and assistance of the Evacuation Committee.

(4) Evacuation transportation is uniformly handled by the Evacuation Committee's specialized committees for land and sea routes. Requests for exemptions from inspection procedures for evacuation special boats or special vehicles are made, and military police provide protection along the way. If township associations independently use commercial ships or commercial vehicles to transport evacuating passengers, the Evacuation Committee cannot assist or avoid the troubles at stations and docks and inspections along the way.

(5) The Evacuation Committee hopes that the Evacuation Committee will provide economic assistance to evacuating fellow villagers. The Evacuation Committee itself has limited funding, and the subsidies for charitable organizations are already insufficient. Therefore, individual subsidies for evacuees are absolutely impossible. Originally, the task of the Evacuation Committee is only to plan evacuation steps, provide transportation, assist in reducing travel troubles, protect safety, and so on. Assisting poor fellow villagers is originally the responsibility of the township associations, and they should provide assistance based on their own capabilities.

As for fellow villagers whose journey back home is far, such as those from Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi, the evacuation destination is not limited to their place of origin. It is determined that general laborers and strong young men will still have a role in Shanghai's military-industrial sector in the future. Even if they evacuate, they must evacuate along with the industry and continue to work as usual.

### Enemy Aircraft Continuously Invade the South China Sea Coast, Attempting to Realize Their Ambition to Approach the Mainland

A certain base in the mainland, 20th – Central News Agency dispatch: The enemy's recent movements focus on the South China Sea, and their offensive can be divided into two aspects: from the Chinese mainland and from the Philippine island base. Since mid-February, the enemy's offensive has gradually intensified, and it became even more active on March 6th. Enemy aircraft, such as B-24, B-25, and P-51 types, have been attacking daily from 9:00 AM to 4:00 PM, most frequently, and even taking advantage of nighttime or bad weather to attack ships sailing in waves, with bombers diving at low altitude and machine-gunning. Enemy aircraft coming from the Chinese mainland, from Hong Kong south to Hainan Island to Tokyo Bay, are responsible for areas such as Xiamen, Shantou, and Hong Kong. Their actions originate from bases as single aircraft or in small numbers, forming triangles or quadrangles of varying sizes. Currently, there are 800 enemy fighters and 500 bombers, totaling 1,300 aircraft, in the Philippines, especially in the Mindoro area. The enemy aircraft have recently shifted from disrupting maritime transport to strategic bombing. Also, the movements of enemy aircraft on the Chinese mainland have recently been significantly strengthened, centered on Kunming. In addition to attacking the coastal areas of South China, they also attack areas in North and Central China, and have recently begun full-scale strategic bombing, indicating a considerable intensity of war effort. Moreover, the enemy seems to be working hard to build coastal bases, such as in the Chong'an area of Fujian Province (240 kilometers northwest of Fuzhou), where they are rushing to build a large and long runway airfield. The enemy is currently making every effort to realize its ambition to approach the mainland.

### Eighty Enemy Aircraft Heavily Damage Nagoya

Tokyo, 19th – Central News Agency dispatch: Enemy B-29 aircraft that attacked Nagoya at dawn on the 19th were engaged by the Japanese side, resulting in four being shot down and about eighty being heavily damaged.

Enemy Aircraft's Atrocities: Machine Gun Strafing

Tokyo, 20th – Central News Agency dispatch: Around 12:40 PM on the 18th, several formations of enemy aircraft dropped a small number of bombs and incendiary bombs on villages in the southwest of Ehime Prefecture and machine-gunned sailboats at sea and pedestrians in the villages, flying as low as 200 to 300 meters above the ground. However, the pedestrians suffered almost no harm. Also, on the same day, two machine-powered sailboats entering the port of Uwajima were suddenly subjected to two machine-gun strafing runs by six enemy aircraft. The ship's hulls suffered dozens of bullet holes, but they continued to sail. Also, at noon on the same day, a train traveling on the down line between Shiida and Matsue on the Nippo Line was also machine-gunned by enemy aircraft. At that time, the locomotive driver's head was struck by several bullets, but the assistant on the upper corner was exceptionally alert and quickly stopped the train, preventing it from overturning.

### Enemy Aircraft Attacking the Northern Kuril Islands Use Rocket Bombs

Sapporo, 20th – Central News Agency dispatch: Enemy aircraft attacking the Northern Kuril Islands have recently begun using rocket bombs, and their purpose and effectiveness are particularly noteworthy. When enemy B-24 aircraft attacked the Northern Kuril Islands on January 25th, they began using this type of bomb. Since then, almost all enemy B-24 aircraft made later have been equipped with this device. When used, the bombs are launched at a height of approximately 500 to 1,000 meters above the target, dropping to 50 to 100 meters. Machine guns are also often used at this time. When the rocket bomb is launched, there is an electrical sound, and brownish smoke comes out of the tail. The diameter of the missile is 7.5 mm, the length is 50 inches, the diameter of the injection cylinder is 12 inches, the length is 113 cm, and the injection cylinder can also fly and explode at the same time as the rocket bomb. The total weight is 50 kg. It is heard that there is no dead angle within the effective range of the bomb, which is its power. The radius of fragment scattering is 50 meters, in a horizontal shape. The bomb's markings are almost unrecognizable until it explodes on the ground, so the best way to avoid this danger is with a human-made air-raid shelter.

The Agricultural Production Increase Promotion Committee, in order to solve this deficiency, has created a new substitute, namely, making fertilizer from garbage from various places, making use of waste. The committee intends to consult with the provincial and municipal governments to instruct them to comply with this.

### Large-Scale Armored Warfare Unfolds on the Southern Wing of the Western Front: Fierce Fighting on the Road to Frankfurt

Lisbon, 20th – Central News Agency dispatch: In the past 24 hours, the battle situation in the southern part of the Western Front has greatly expanded. Large-scale armored warfare has unfolded in the area between the Moselle, Saar, and Rhine rivers. The American army's intention is clearly to cut off the German army west of the Rhine River with pincer tactics. Furthermore, the American Third Army is now advancing further south and southwest, with the vanguard of its armored units crossing the Nahe River and continuing south, intensifying pressure west of Saarbrucken and advancing towards Bingenfield. The American Seventh Army, which is attacking the southern wing of the Saar front, has now shifted its attack focus to the northwest of Hellbach Biese and the southeast of Saarbrucken.

Berlin, 20th – Central News Agency dispatch, Huitong News Agency: The American bridgehead on the east bank of the Rhine River opposite Remagen is fighting for the 10-kilometer-long highway to Cologne and Frankfurt, but the outcome has not yet been decided. On Sunday, the German army counterattacked repeatedly, pushing the American army westward. Some enemy forces crossed the highway and entered the two cities of Lutzschidt and Sanninburg. The two sides are in close combat for the Olberg ridge and the northern line of Spenberch, and the city of Honingen is still under contention.

### Fierce Battle for the Steinburg Bridgehead

Berlin, 20th – Central News Agency dispatch, Huitong News Agency, A German military spokesman said: The situation in the Steinburg bridgehead is that the Soviet army will spare no sacrifice to reach the Warta River area, and the German army will spare no cost to prevent it from achieving this goal.

Berlin, 20th – Central News Agency dispatch, Huitong News Agency: Soviet General Konev has concentrated his forces, apparently intending to break into the industrial area east of Ostrava at all costs. Konev's goal is to occupy the Silesian region west of the upper reaches of the Warta River in order to advance towards the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia. Currently, the Soviet army is attacking relentlessly in the areas of Radipol and Kozel, with little progress. At the same time, the offensive launched from Grottgau towards Neisse has also come into contact with the main force north of Neustadt.

### Thirty-Nine Countries Sign the International Aviation Convention

One of the provisions in the convention is that "all agreements on international air transport must be fully disclosed," which is of utmost importance.

### Mrs. Churchill Invited to Visit the Soviet Union

### Chongqing Region Forcibly Collects Grain

Central News Agency dispatch: The Chongqing Kuomintang has recently been forcibly collecting grain in various places. According to the Yan'an Xinhua Daily, the Emei County government dispatched a large number of section chiefs and staff members to various towns to collect grain. Farmers who were unable to pay the grain due to poverty or disaster were sent to the county government for detention. Their number is as many as ten or twenty people per day. Liu of Puxing Town and Wang of Nanwang Temple committed suicide because they were unable to pay the grain. Wealthy classes buy and hoard grain, causing prices to soar, and the people suffer extremely deeply.

### European Livelihoods Under the Iron Heel of Britain and America (Part 2)

Furthermore, due to the destruction and confiscation of transportation facilities and factories, the unemployed have flooded Italy like a deluge. One-tenth of Rome's population, or 200,000 people, have no food to eat. Even those who have jobs earn only 30 lire a day, but each meal costs 200 to 300 lire, making it impossible to maintain a living. Food shortages, soaring prices, and unemployment are rampant in Italy, naturally leading to crime, especially among women. The vicious inflation in France rivals that of Italy. In addition to military scrip, more than 600 billion francs in French banknotes are circulating in the market. The exchange rate with the US dollar and British pound is declining daily. However, the food problem is extremely serious, so a 50% increase in wages per week is not considered a rare phenomenon. In France, as in Italy, people cannot use transportation easily, and buying train and ship tickets is extremely difficult. The coal mines in northern France have not yet been taken over, so Paris still cannot get a single piece of coal today. The forest, reputed to be the world's largest, has been almost completely felled by the citizens of Paris. Black market meat is often sold in cigarette shops, and buying and selling vegetables in pharmacies has become commonplace. American soldiers, lacking supplies, often steal military supplies and sell them at high prices. Those who are discovered and subjected to military law have become the talk of the town. Movie theaters and theaters have all ceased operations. Only cafes and dance halls are still open, all of which are exclusively for British and American soldiers. The British and American propaganda machines loudly proclaim that the current vicious inflation and food shortages in France are all caused by Germany's destruction of French institutions. However, Frederick Crowell, the former president of the US Manufacturing Association, published his inspection results in his home country on January 5:

It is an exaggeration to say that the people of France and Belgium lived a miserable life under German rule. In fact, France enjoyed "consumption comfort" under Nazi rule.

His words exposed the deceptive propaganda manufactured by his own country.

Greece and Germany after World War I are comparable in human history. Greece's vicious inflation is one such example. The country had long entered the process of inflation during German rule, but since the British and American troops landed last September, the degree of inflation has risen sharply. At the time of the German army's occupation, the amount of currency in circulation was only 21 billion drachmas, but in less than half a year, by the end of last year, it had reached the astronomical figure of 300 billion drachmas, and the currency's credit plummeted.

Let's take a look at a real example. Last fall, three cigarettes were worth 5 million drachmas. The current new government, with British aid, is issuing new drachma coins with gold reserves.

One British pound is equal to 600 new coins; one new coin is equal to 50 billion old coins. The currency is being reorganized according to this exchange rate. However, due to political instability, currency instability is also affected, and the national economy and people's livelihood can only be lost.

Hungry People's Demonstration

In order to recover and adjust the 185 billion francs of currency issued by Germany during its occupation, Belgium signed a new currency agreement with Britain in October last year. According to this agreement, currency consolidation measures were announced.

For example, Belgian banknotes of 10,000 francs, 1,000 francs, 500 francs, and 100 francs were canceled after October 13 and must be exchanged for new currency. However, the limit for receiving new currency is 2,000 francs per person. For cash exceeding this limit, 40% will not be issued temporarily, and 60% will be permanently frozen. At the same time, a high rate of wartime unjust enrichment tax must also be paid. So-called freezing is de facto confiscation, but in addition to confiscation, taxes must also be levied, so people are very angry.

In addition, the Belgian people have been oppressed by the British economy, and the sacrifice has been too severe, so the whole country is in great chaos. Brussels has almost stopped all commercial activities, and the value of the old currency has fallen unbelievably. In addition to the lack of food and fuel, the unbearable citizens gathered at the crossroads and held a "hungry people's demonstration" march to the government offices. Although the government mobilized all the trucks and trains, there was no goods to transport. In addition, the purchasing and distribution agencies often engage in corruption, which added fuel to the fire and created a more distorted shortage of materials. At the end of last year, Prime Minister Pierlot personally flew to London to request assistance, but the British and American rich authorities used military transportation as an excuse and could not transport food.

Currency Devaluation

The consolidation of the French currency is the biggest difficulty in French domestic policy. The de Gaulle regime issued an order prohibiting the sale of gold bars, the surrender of gold bars and foreign currency, and the prohibition of the export and import of German marks in France. At the same time, a new law was announced, saying that all property earned during the Vichy government era through transactions with Germany and illegal commercial activities will be confiscated. This is because the decrees of the powerless regime are just decrees, which only caused greater chaos. The French franc plummeted, and the Louis gold coin (old 20-franc gold coin) jumped from 3,800 francs to 4,350 francs. Black market trading in US dollars and British pounds is rampant everywhere.

The irresponsible currency policies implemented by the British and American authorities in the occupied areas have everywhere fueled vicious inflation. This is a trick to make weak countries rely on gold dollars and gold pounds through inflation, and the result is that they can only survive by yielding to Britain and America. The European countries that surrendered to Britain and America are in such a tragic situation that the people of each country can only work for Britain and America like slaves. This is a tyrannical act against people of the same culture. It goes without saying how the United States will abuse us Asians who they have never recognized as human beings.

Representatives from various Shanghai native place associations were invited to attend. Gu Jiwu, Chen Binhe, and Zhou Yuying, directors of the committee's various groups, as well as Director Zhou Yuying of the Social Welfare Bureau, attended on time. More than 60 native place association representatives were present. Director Zhou first reported on the key points for native place associations in handling evacuation:

(1) General public evacuation registration will begin on April 1, and will be handled in 18 districts according to the areas under the jurisdiction of the police stations.

(2) Those who evacuate back to their hometowns must return their residence permits in exchange for movement permits, and the competent authorities will stamp them with a "returning home" mark. The procedure is very simple.

(3) Those who return to their hometowns with Shanghai residence permits without going through evacuation procedures will be restricted by local governments in the future.

(4) Those who evacuate back to their hometowns will be prohibited from returning to Shanghai without necessary reasons. Those who must return to Shanghai must apply for permission from the competent authorities.

(b) To answer inquiries from compatriots regarding evacuation procedures. (c) To convey notices from the Evacuation Committee. (d) Other matters entrusted by the Evacuation Committee. Native place associations may not handle evacuation without being entrusted by the Evacuation Committee, such as hiring their own vehicles and ships, or purchasing tickets on their behalf, in order to prevent malpractices.

(6) The acquisition of transportation and the purchase of tickets will be handled by the two specialized committees of the Evacuation Committee, namely the waterway and land routes.

Gu Jiwu explained the various points of evacuation and movement one by one. Then, the discussion of various actual problems began. Chen Binhe and Gu Jiwu respectively answered the various questions raised by the representatives of the native place associations. The meeting adjourned after more than an hour.

### Revised Usage Rules for the Bund and Wusong River Shorelines; No Fixed Announcement of Usage Fees

The public wharves on both sides of the Huangpu River in this city are set up by the municipal government to facilitate the berthing of civilian ships. At the same time, merchants and civilians may also apply to use the coastal shorelines for berthing ships nearby. The former Public Utilities Bureau had established usage rules. It is heard that there have been some recent revisions, which have now been revised and promulgated by the Municipal Government and implemented by the Municipal Construction Bureau in accordance with them. The fees for using the shoreline have also been clearly stipulated. The details are as follows: (A) Wusong River shoreline usage fee: 100 yuan per meter per year in national currency. (B) Huangpu River shoreline usage fee: Section A, from the west bank of Wusongkou Fort Taiwan to Leping Road, the usage fee should be 800 yuan per meter per year.

Section F, from the east bank of Xigou Ferry to Zhangjiabang, 900 yuan. Section G, from the east bank of Zhangjiabang to Zhonghua Wharf, 400 yuan. Section H, from the east bank of Zhonghua Wharf to the Qianbujingkou city boundary line in Fengxian District, 200 yuan.

### Air Raid Shelters in Various Districts Completed One After Another

The Municipal Civil Defense Headquarters, in order to prevent air raids and ensure the safety of citizens' lives, decided to dig air raid shelters in various districts of the city. Secretary-General Luo, on behalf of Mayor Zhou, broke ground. It is learned that the shelters have been dug and officially received by the headquarters. As for the air raid shelters in various districts of the city, 1,573 have been completed, 673 have not been completed, and the planned number is 842, for a total of 3,088. However, according to the person in charge of the headquarters to the reporter, the number of air raid shelters is still insufficient, so they will continue to be dug in the future, and it is hoped that citizens will cooperate to select appropriate addresses and submit them to the authorities for automatic digging.

### Various Factories Request Restoration of Electricity Supply

Regarding the electricity supply issue for major factories, although it has not yet been fully resolved, it is learned that various factories in this city, due to electricity issues, have sent letters to their respective trade associations requesting the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to find ways to restore electricity supply from the authorities. The Chamber of Commerce, upon receiving such documents, has truthfully submitted them to the Ministry of Industry and the former Public Utilities Bureau, as well as the current Construction Bureau, requesting them to negotiate with the power company at their discretion. It is also heard that the authorities are fully dependent on coal sources for electricity generation, and are currently engaged in coal procurement. At the same time, they are striving to evacuate factories in this city to suitable areas, so there will be no problem with factory production work.

### Retail Consumption Tax on Cigarettes Should be Paid Within the Time Limit

The Municipal Finance Bureau, in order to rectify the special tax on cigarette consumption and unify the collection agencies, has specially set up a special tax collection committee for cigarette retail consumption. It is responsible for the collection and reporting. Now, the Finance Bureau issued a notice, ordering all cigarette firms in the city that after paying taxes, they should follow the regulations of the committee and submit the amount of tax payable to the place designated by the committee for verification and transfer within the time limit, and must not delay, resulting in punishment.

At No. 85, Lane 432, Xinchang Road in this city, a bloody case of a poisonous woman murdering her husband occurred yesterday morning. Zhan Yunying (30 years old, from Anhui, engaged in old goods), a resident on the rear floor of that number, was allegedly killed by his wife, Zhan Zhou (29 years old, from Zhejiang). For unknown reasons, she first cut his head with a kitchen knife, then cut his forehead and neck, and even cut his lower legs, thighs, upper legs, and waist more than a dozen times, dividing the body into eight pieces and putting them in a white empty leather suitcase, attempting to move the body to destroy the evidence. The second landlord, Wang Xieyang, discovered this and captured the murderer, Zhan Zhou, on the spot, and handed her over to the Xincheng Sub-bureau, which has jurisdiction over the area. The sub-bureau is conducting a careful investigation.

### The Enemy America Attempts to Control China's Economy After the War; Minister Matsudaira Exposes the Enemy's American Ambitions

The Shanghai Office of the Allied Japanese Embassy held a routine press conference yesterday afternoon. Information Minister Matsudaira elaborated on the means by which the United States is exerting economic pressure on Chongqing, attempting to control China's economic forces after the war. The main points of his speech are as follows:

According to news from the American side two or three days ago, former US Price Administration Director Henderson has arrived in Chongqing to conduct investigations in order to stabilize prices due to the soaring prices there. At the same time, Nelson, the chief adviser of China's Wartime Production Board, has contacted the authorities after returning to the United States and decided to send technicians to work in Chongqing. Some personnel have already arrived in Chongqing and started working. According to recent news, American economic experts have completed their report after several months of investigation in Chongqing, and have drafted a five-year plan for industrial development, requiring a total of 200,000 US dollars. It is still doubtful whether Chongqing will accept this plan. We believe that if Chongqing wants to develop its industry and proceeds according to this plan, all previously drafted plans will inevitably be completely changed, and in fact, all resources and manpower in the future will be dependent on the United States. From the American perspective, this is a long-planned plan. The United States has two policies towards East Asia: one is to crush Japan's war power, and the other is to control China's important industries and place them under American economic suppression. The United States is now doing everything possible to crush Japan as soon as possible, attacking Japan regardless of everything. The industrial development plan for China will take five years, so of course its purpose is not to complete this war, but to permanently hold China's economic power after the war. Therefore, Chongqing should carefully consider this plan of the United States.

Minister Matsudaira to Broadcast Tonight: Information Minister Matsudaira will broadcast in Japanese to all parties at 7:20 PM today (21st) at the Shanghai Radio Station. It is reported that the content of his broadcast will be to expose the conflicting opinions of the British and American fleets in the Pacific Ocean and the increasing internal strife.

### Supplementary Distribution of Coal Briquettes for Households in the Old District 18; 5 Catties per Certificate Sold for 200 Yuan; Simultaneous Distribution in Other Districts

The Municipal Materials Distribution Office previously distributed coal briquettes for households in the old District 18 and 8 from February 6th to 19th based on the 40th Comprehensive Distribution Certificate. However, due to the interruption of electricity supply to the designated coal briquette factories during the distribution period, even though the distribution period was once extended to February 25th, some citizens still did not receive the coal briquettes. Now that the coal briquette factories are shipping as usual, a supplementary sale will be held from March 17th to 26th based on the 40th Comprehensive Distribution Certificate. The amount per certificate is still 5 catties, and the price has been adjusted to 200 yuan per 5 catties in national currency due to the sharp increase in the factory's manufacturing costs, in order to maintain production. According to the reporter's investigation, the Materials Distribution Office will not extend the supplementary distribution period for coal briquettes for households in the old districts 18 and 8 after the expiration date. Therefore, citizens in those districts who have not yet received coal briquettes should go to the designated coal shops with their certificates to purchase them immediately. It is also learned that the distribution of coal briquettes for households in other districts will also begin on March 17th. All quantities, prices, and certificates used are the same as those in the old Districts 18 and 8.

Household Sugar to be Distributed Within the Month: The next period of household sugar distribution has been planned by the Sino-Japanese Sugar Industry Association and is scheduled to be distributed within this month. The amount to be distributed this time is the same as the previous period, with each household being able to purchase 5 taels at a price of 265 yuan, which is slightly higher than the previous period by 5 yuan to compensate for the freight losses of the previous period.

### Although the Motives Differ, the Enthusiasm is the Same; Everyone Responds to the "Free School Fund"; Funds from the Charity Market have been Received

This newspaper is running a free elementary school. Regarding funding, the Charity Market Committee has previously agreed to allocate one million yuan as start-up expenses. The full amount has been received yesterday. The Charity Market's enthusiastic support has enabled the work of the free elementary school to begin and be promoted, which is commendable. Yesterday, we received letters from readers expressing their support, all driven by compassion and a sense of responsibility, with sincere words that overflowed with expression. We certainly feel that the work is arduous, but with the enthusiastic response from society, we are confident that we will be able to accomplish the task. Excerpts from the letters are as follows:

(1) A letter from all the students of the Private Qicheng Elementary School says: "Today, all of our students saw the record in your newspaper about the establishment of a free school, and everyone felt that this is a very valuable and meaningful welfare undertaking. Because it gives a large group of helpless children who have dropped out of school due to the coercion of life the opportunity to study, and it can also help a group of poor teachers to make a living, isn't this a 'double win'? So, after the morning meeting, we all generously pooled all the pocket money in our pockets, totaling 10,000 yuan in Central Reserve Notes, and donated it to your newspaper as the 'Free School Fund'."

"We are all elementary school students who are currently sharing the benefits, but driven by human compassion and a sense of responsibility, we are contributing this small amount beyond our means. However, we believe that the number of elementary school students in Shanghai is quite considerable, and we hope that everyone will respond together in accordance with the ancient motto of the sages of 'Already Hungry, Already Drowning'. Then, it will not be difficult to achieve millions of dollars. Our small amount is just a 'brick to attract jade'!"

(2) Wang Zhenfeng, a primary school teacher who changed his profession, wrote: "Zhenfeng has served in the education field for more than ten years and has always been very interested in education. However, recently, due to the meager income, he cannot maintain his family and has been forced to abandon Confucianism and engage in commerce. Even in his spare time, he still thinks about education. Recently, he saw that your newspaper is running a free elementary school and initiating the fundraising of 'Free School Funds', which can both help those who have dropped out of school and maintain teachers who have lost their jobs, achieving two goals with one stone, which is a very good intention. Therefore, he has contributed 5,000 yuan in Central Reserve Notes, which he earned in one day, as the 'Free School Fund'. He also hopes that people from all walks of life will respond quickly so that free elementary schools can be established universally, which will benefit the country and the people without limit?"

(3) Carpenter Ding Shenglin wrote: "Last night, according to my son Xinggen, your newspaper is running ten free elementary schools. I was very happy to hear this. Forty years ago, I was also a child who dropped out of school because my family was poor. I had to learn carpentry. To this day, I only hate myself for not reading a few more years. Every time I need to bid for work or write letters, I have to ask Mr. Wang at the word-splitting stall. The pain of the past forty years cannot be forgotten at any time. But how can I watch so many children drop out of school like me? I am old, and the children have their future. Although I personally took out 1,000 yuan, I hope that people with influence in society will contribute more money to save the children who have dropped out of school."

### Employee Loan Office Expands Loan Scope

The Shanghai Industrial and Commercial Employee Loan Office originally targeted industrial and commercial employees as its loan targets. Starting from March, it has expanded its scope to include shop employees in addition to company employees. The loan limit has also been increased to 50,000 yuan, depending on the needs, in order to alleviate the difficulties faced by industrial and commercial employees in times of urgent need.

### Report on Donations for Free School Fund (2)

### Reader's Assistance for Education News: Urging Schools to Collect Funds

The current session's Assistance for Education Office has issued notifications to each school, along with blank receipts, to collect funds with their official seals. Most schools have already received their payments in full. However, a small number of schools have yet to collect, possibly due to postal errors. They are urged to send someone with their official seals to contact us. Furthermore, each school should collect and submit all approved student notification slips to the office for verification. If there are any students who have transferred or dropped out, the assistance funds should be returned. It is hoped that all schools' assistance funds can be fully settled within this month.

Broadcast Fundraising for Education Assistance: During the Lunar New Year, this newspaper and the News Daily worked with Nanyang Brothers Tobacco Company, borrowing the facilities of the Huangpu Radio Station to broadcast appeals for education assistance funds. Enthusiastic individuals from all walks of life responded actively, donating a total of 410,000 yuan in a short period. People have been assigned to collect all the donated money. This amount will be divided equally between the two newspapers, totaling 205,000 yuan each.

Overview of the Charity Bazaar's Closing: The Charity Bazaar for Relieving Students Unable to Attend School, organized by four groups, has now been declared closed after more than a month of active organization and accounting. Once the scholarships for each school have been collected, a full account will be published in the newspapers. The charity bazaar was originally launched to assist this session's education assistance fund of the Shen Bao and Xin Wen Bao. Now that the two newspapers' education assistance fund for this session has concluded, the work of relieving students unable to attend school can also temporarily come to an end. In addition to allocating funds to the two newspaper offices for education assistance, subsidizing the relief efforts for students unable to attend school by the two youth associations, scholarships for each school, and all expenses, a portion of the funds from this charity bazaar remains unused. Furthermore, some of the goods donated by various sectors have not been sold. The method for handling these goods and funds has been resolved by the Charity Bazaar Committee of the four groups on the 10th of this month, to be entirely handed over to the male and female youth associations for continued use in relieving students' living expenses. The two youth associations have now decided to use all the goods and funds as funding for their future student work-study loan programs. Detailed measures will be announced in the newspapers after they are finalized.

Air Raid Victim's Bequest for Education: "To Whom It May Concern: On December 19th of last year, during the tragic air raid in the Nanshi district, our hospital admitted an injured male unidentified person from Hugunying Road, who died due to the severity of his injuries before he could be treated. After consulting with nearby residents, no family members have come forward to claim the body. His situation is truly pitiful. We are now allocating the 10,000 yuan in cash (although a portion of it has been pierced by shrapnel, it is still usable) found on his body to the Shen Bao and Xin Wen Bao education assistance funds, with 5,000 yuan for each, to be used for social good. We are sending two attachments with 5,000 yuan in cash each. We respectfully request your receipt. Sincerely, Nanshi Municipal Hospital."

Yesterday's Education Assistance Funds Received: Nanyang Brothers Tobacco Company's broadcast fundraising (handled by Continental Advertising Agency) 205,000 yuan, unidentified person 5,000 yuan, Kai Ming Bookstore 3,000 yuan, Xiao Shiquan, Liu Rongji, 1,000 yuan each. Total received: 215,000 yuan. Remaining balance: 10,667,349.03 yuan.
