### For the Establishment of Peace in Greater East Asia: Japan Determined to Fight to the End; Will Exert Utmost Efforts to Assist the National Government's Grain Policy

Ambassador Tani Issues Statement

Central News Agency Report: Japanese Plenipotentiary Ambassador to China, Mr. Tani Masayuki, met with reporters from various Shanghai newspapers at the Broadway Mansions at 5:40 PM on June 30th, answering their questions in detail as follows:

Achieving Victory Through War

Question: Now that the war has entered a decisive stage, how should China and Japan cooperate closely to achieve victory?

Answer: In all matters seeking cooperation, regardless of the nature of the cooperation, as long as the parties involved have a genuine understanding, the cooperation will be more meaningful. Now, Greater East Asia has reached a decisive stage, which can also be said to be an important situation following the European War. The United States and Britain are actually intending to turn Greater East Asia into their colonies. This war, Japan seeks political equality, economic reciprocity, and mutual respect for inherent cultures among East Asian nations, as well as to preserve the sovereignty of each nation. This is the purpose of Japan's war, which is also the purpose of the Greater East Asia War. Japan is fighting to achieve this belief, and the Japanese nation has this special belief, and is determined to fight to the end. Therefore, this war is fought for Greater East Asia, not for aggression. Victory can naturally be achieved through war, but this victory is a victory for establishing peace in Greater East Asia. This is what I feel.

Impressions of the San Francisco Conference

Question: What are the Ambassador's impressions of the so-called "International Security Organization" produced by the San Francisco Conference?

Answer: The International Security Organization of the San Francisco Conference can be said to be similar to the League of Nations produced after the First European War. Its importance only lies in achieving the despotism of major powers and denying the positions and interests of small countries. Because of these relationships, they spare no effort to use various means and methods to safeguard the desires in their minds, and thus this organization is produced. In other words, this organization is filled with unfair phenomena from the beginning. Although it was discussed and formed at the San Francisco Conference, if international problems arise and it wants to use it to resolve them, its actions and opinions will be difficult to reach a consensus, which is not difficult to imagine. This is proof of the uselessness of the past League of Nations. Now that there is the same organization again, it can show that the politicians of each country have no progress in their thinking. Their attempt to dominate the world is the most unfortunate thing for mankind. Therefore, this organization cannot guarantee world peace. In other words, countries should understand each other's positions, that is, major countries have an environment, and small countries have a position, respecting each other's fair and selfless position, and truly promoting the spirit of East Asia, then the world can be saved, and small countries can have a day to be saved.

Sound Policies for the New Grain Harvest

Question: After the National Government takes emergency measures on rice, to what extent will your country's authorities in China cooperate? And will there be new unified plans when the new grain harvest comes onto the market in the future?

Answer: The National Government has formally announced the content of the rice policy, and its content is very accurate and without any shortcomings. I admire it very much. But the most important thing is to hope that the National Government can overcome all difficulties and succeed. The Japanese authorities in China and the Embassy have also issued statements expressing their full cooperation with the National Government. As for the new grain harvest, it is not yet known whether the National Government authorities have new unified methods. I believe that the National Government will be able to adapt to the environment and have sound policies when the new grain harvest comes onto the market. At that time, Japan will of course still provide cooperation. This is what I dare to say.

The Door to Peace is Not Closed

Question: There have been many rumors about peace recently. What is the Ambassador's view on this? Is there a path to peace that can be followed at present?

Answer: Japan's attitude towards peace has been fully stated in the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty and the Greater East Asia Conference Joint Declaration. Recently, Prime Minister Suzuki has also made a clear statement on this matter. However, some people still do not understand Japan's attitude. However, the evolution of the war will naturally arouse their awareness that East Asia shares the same fate. The proliferation of peace talks in recent times is enough to show the existence of those who are truly worried about the future of East Asia. As for Japan, the door to peace has not been closed, but it must be observed whether the other party is willing to step into the door of peace. This is an important point.

### He Yingqin Discusses the War Situation

Guangzhou, 30th (Central News Agency Dispatch): According to a Central News Agency dispatch from Chongqing, after inspecting the Hunan-Guangdong front lines, American reporters stationed in Chongqing went to Kunming on the 27th to meet with General He Yingqin, Commander-in-Chief of the Army and Air Force in Chongqing. In response to the reporters' questions, Mr. He emphasized the Japanese army's combat power and frankly admitted the difficulty of the Chongqing army launching a counter-offensive on its own. If there is no landing operation on the Chinese mainland, the Chongqing army cannot independently drive out the Japanese army, so the United States must increase the supply of military equipment. Furthermore, even if the transportation between Japan and the Chinese mainland is completely cut off, the Japanese army in China must continue to fight, because the Japanese army can use the resources of Manchuria.

### Enemy America, Under the Pretext of Aiding Chongqing, is Engaged in Destroying China: Remarks by Section Chief Shimada

Lieutenant Colonel Shimada, head of the press section of the Japanese Army in Shanghai, made a statement to newspaper reporters in the city at yesterday (30th)'s press conference, as follows:

The Chongqing Side Relies Solely on American Aid

Recently, the Chongqing side's public opinion has excessively exaggerated the matter of a general counter-offensive. Although the Japanese side is paying attention to this, it is paying even more attention to the fact that the Chongqing regime relies solely on American aid. In fact, the Chongqing side has not obtained genuine aid from the United States. The United States is only using various pretexts of aiding Chongqing to actively engage in destroying China. Chiang Kai-shek met with foreign reporters for four consecutive days on the 28th of this month and stated that the Chongqing army, trained in the American style and equipped with American equipment, is preparing to take a combat stance against the Japanese army soon. If the Allied forces land directly, the Chinese army will not feel any difficulty in fighting the Japanese army on the mainland. He feels deeply satisfied with the United States' cooperation in military affairs, but hopes for more active economic assistance to China. He Yingqin also said when meeting with foreign reporters on the 25th that if the American army lands on the Chinese mainland, he is convinced that the Japanese army will be defeated. However, in order to achieve this day, it is necessary to continue to rely on the American mechanization equipment, and considerable time is also needed in preparation. The Chongqing army's combat readiness has not yet been completed.

Relations Between the Nationalists and the Communists Have Completely Broken Down

That the United States' strengthened aid to Chongqing has completely broken relations between the Nationalists and the Communists is well known. According to a Xinhua News Agency telegram from Yan'an on June 26, the CCP decided to oppose the American imperialist clique of Hurley, claiming that they attempted to establish a dictatorship in China in order to extract the sweat and blood of the Chinese people, and greatly criticized Chongqing. It is expected that if Yan'an decides to convene a people's representative conference in the liberated areas to counter the National Congress convened by Chongqing on November 12, then the United States will always fully support Chongqing.

Attempting to Control China's Production

Recently, the United States established the U.S. Army Command in the China Theater. On the surface, it is due to the necessity of combat, but in reality, it is preparing to develop Chinese industry and control currency and prices. In the past, American military organs have been involved in interference in controlling transportation, etc. In particular, 25 American industrialists related to various communes in China are planning to strengthen the unification of Chinese production after taking office. From this, it can be seen that the American system has already had a considerable degree of political and economic foundation in China. Based on the above, the attitude of the American army towards the Chinese people is becoming more and more arrogant. According to recent mainland newspapers, the American army threatened the Chongqing army from behind with pistols to come and attack. If they were unwilling, they would be shot. Therefore, the mainland press is criticizing the American army quite a bit. In particular, incidents of violence against Chinese women have been increasing. In order to avoid this excessive criticism, Whitman has restricted American soldiers from going out, strictly prohibiting flirting with good women and extortion and rape. From this, the arrogance of the American army can be seen. Recently, the Japanese army has a large military force on the Chinese mainland. Even if the American army lands, it is not afraid. However, if the American forces penetrate deep into China and cause the Chongqing army to move, Japan is determined to strike and destroy them at any time.

Weekly Commentary: Coarse Grains and Shanghai Citizens' Food Supply by Shen Fu Cheng

Today’s food problem for the people is the biggest livelihood issue. If this food problem cannot be resolved in a reasonable manner, the people’s suffering cannot be alleviated even in the initial stage, and naturally, there will be no stability in their lives. To seek a reasonable solution to the food problem, thereby alleviating the people's suffering in the first step, is certainly an important task for the authorities. However, from the people's perspective, regarding the food that sustains their own lives, they should also try their best to solve it within the scope of their own power to reduce the severity of the entire food problem and alleviate the degree of the entire people's suffering. To put it more simply, for the resolution of the food problem, the government authorities should take full responsibility for overall planning, and the people themselves should also take individual responsibility for adapting to the environment. Only with such consistency from top to bottom and coordinated cooperation can a reasonable and practical solution be achieved. Otherwise, if the people only complain that the authorities do not seek a solution, the authorities will at most reach the stage of treating the symptom but not the disease. As a result, food will eventually become an unsolvable problem, and the people's suffering will naturally increase.

As for Shanghai's food problem, it is actually even more difficult to solve. Because Shanghai itself does not produce food, and the people of Shanghai are avid consumers who insist on eating white rice. Everyone has the concept and habit of only eating rice for meals. In recent years, the environment has changed, and now it has reached the point where it is absolutely impossible to satisfy the desire of Shanghai people to eat white rice. If the people of Shanghai themselves still insist on the habit of only eating rice, then they will only starve or go hungry. If the rich rely on their money to compete for hoarding rice, if the middle class rely on some stored rice to continue consuming as before, if the lower class also believe that arranging is not yet exhausted, and they can still insist on not eating anything but rice, then they will only drive up rice prices further and trap their lives in even deeper suffering.

Therefore, for us Shanghai citizens, in order to recognize the realistic situation of the food problem and reduce our own future suffering, we should abandon the concept and habit of only eating rice and should try our best to use coarse grains for food, or at least mix them with coarse grains. According to accurate estimates, the current grain is in a period between harvests, and the amount of rice stored in rice-producing areas is not sufficient. Even if it can be transported smoothly to Shanghai, the quantity will not be as large as desired, and the price will inevitably rise due to increased costs. However, the amount of coarse grains stored in coarse grain-producing areas is relatively abundant, enough to supply other places. Therefore, in terms of comparing the stock of rice and coarse grains, before the new grain harvest, the Shanghai citizens' food supply must be supplemented by coarse grains. This is the inevitable limitation of facts and the environment, and we cannot but adapt to the situation. I hope that the citizens will first understand this.

Moreover, there may be slight preferences in taste and psychology between eating rice and eating coarse grains, but in terms of maintaining survival, the efficiency is the same. On the contrary, in terms of nutritional value, coarse grains are better than white rice. According to the analysis and comparison of various essential nutrients, the richest is millet, followed by wheat, then corn, and the lowest is white rice. Therefore, eating coarse grains not only does not reduce the nutrients needed by the body but also has the possibility of increasing health. Northerners eat noodles and coarse grains all year round, and their bodies are stronger than those of southerners who eat rice. The author also comes from a coarse grain-producing area and has eaten naked barley and corn for food since childhood. He rarely suffers from illnesses. After coming to Shanghai and switching to white rice, he feels physically weak. I am confident that this is not an exaggeration. Therefore, in terms of nutrition and health, eating coarse grains is more beneficial.

In short, the solution to Shanghai's food problem in the future cannot but be supplemented by coarse grains, and citizens should automatically change their habits. At the same time, we feel that the proportional increase in the price of coarse grains along with the price of rice is completely an artificial increase in the supply quantity and has no reason at all. The authorities should pay attention to suppressing it. On the other hand, it is extremely necessary to purchase and transport large quantities of supplies from coarse grain-producing areas to Shanghai, allocate them at a fair price, supplement the people's food, and regulate the people's food. I hope that the authorities and influential people in the private sector will jointly plan and implement this as soon as possible, so that the Shanghai citizens' food problem can be gradually resolved.

### National Government Instructs To Reassure Vice President Zhou, Granted One Month's Leave for Funeral Arrangements

Nanjing, 30th (Central News Agency Dispatch): National Government Vice President Zhou Fohai lost his father early in life and was raised and educated by his legal mother, Madam Ma Tai. Over the years, Mr. Zhou has been engaged in national affairs and has been unable to take care of her. Yesterday morning, the tragic news came that Madam Ma had passed away in Guiyang on the 25th of this month. Mr. Zhou was extremely saddened upon hearing the news and telegraphed Acting Chairman Chen to request resignation from all his concurrent positions in order to fulfill his filial piety. Acting Chairman Chen believed that the country was in a difficult situation and it was not the time for him to resign, so he sent a telegram to reassure him. The National Government also instructed to grant him one month's leave for funeral arrangements. The record is as follows:

"Acting Chairman Chen's Reply Telegram" To Shanghai Vice President Zhou Fohai Brother Li Jian, I returned to Nanjing from northern Jiangsu last night and only read it. It is impossible to overcome the grief. Your filial piety is extraordinary and you should be saddened, but the national affairs are so difficult that we rely on your participation in the great plan. It is definitely not the time to resign. I hope that you will put national affairs first and change your grief. The so-called resignation from your concurrent positions is not necessary. You have not fully recovered from your illness, and I hope you will cherish yourself. The National Government has granted you one month's leave. I hope you will take care of yourself. Younger brother Chen Gongbo bows his head.

In view of this, the Ministry of Finance has specially revised Article 2 of the original method for transporting currency, which stipulates that a passport is required for amounts exceeding 300,000 yuan, to amounts exceeding 1 million yuan to meet the needs of the market and benefit merchants and people.

### Baoshan and Luodian

— Ma Junliang

Baoshan is located near Shanghai. Before the war, it belonged to Jiangsu Province. It was only after the incident that it was assigned to Shanghai, initially as a special district, and then restored to county status. This old city was very prosperous before the war, but it happened to be in the war zone during the incident. Therefore, the county seat is desolate, with broken walls and ruins, a heart-wrenching sight. The street scene is far from what it used to be.

Baoshan's Agricultural Products

According to statistics, the total population of Baoshan County is over 100,000. Administratively, the county governs the towns of Yuepu, Yangxing, Luodian, Liuhang, Chuansha, Shengqiao, Gucun, Chenhang, Guangfu, etc. In terms of public security and urban appearance, Luodian is often considered the best. The total area of Baoshan County is 270,000 mu, of which farmland accounts for about half. Last year's agricultural harvest was more abundant than in neighboring counties. Here is a statistic of last year's output: The total rice production of the county was over 250,000 dan, cotton over 70,000 dan, wheat over 300,000 dan, and hemp about 700 shi. As for rural side occupations, half of the households make a living by raising livestock, and the other half by weaving homespun cloth, a significant amount of which is sold to other counties. Overall, Baoshan's rural economy is moving towards recovery.

Luodian, the Leading Town

Luodian is the leading town in Baoshan. In recent years, due to the unrest in rural areas, many people have moved to live in the town. Therefore, the town is prosperous, with a dense population, rows of shops, and numerous vendors. Small factories (spinning, flour) invested and established by people from Shanghai are springing up like mushrooms after rain. Today's Luodian is stepping into the prosperity it had during the war.

Luodian has four elementary schools and one junior high school. The Private Cotton Industry Elementary School is sponsored by the local cotton industry association. The school board members are all local wealthy gentlemen, and the principal has been serving in the education field for many years. The Private Fengle Elementary School is sponsored by the local rice and grain association, and the principal is Zang Shiru. The County Luodian Elementary School was originally located in Xincun, but has now been moved to a temple, and the person in charge is Yang Tengxiang. Jingxiu Elementary School, the former principal of the school was Cheng, is actually run by Ms. Ma Rongde, and the school's reputation is growing day by day. As for junior high schools, there is only Luoxi Middle School. Each school has five or six hundred students, with the most students in the Cotton Industry Elementary School. The teachers are all young people from the town, half male and half female, with uneven levels of education. Some have not even graduated from elementary school themselves, leading to many jokes.

In today's world of expensive rice and firewood, the life of teachers is particularly difficult. The salaries of each school are relatively high, calculated based on the current market price of rice (this is true for private schools, but not for county schools). For example, the director of the Cotton Industry Elementary School receives 2 dou and 2 sheng, and the class teachers and subject teachers receive 2 dou and 1 dou and 8 sheng, respectively. Fengle is similar to the Cotton Industry Elementary School, while Jingxiu is slightly inferior. The most pitiful is the County Luodian Elementary School. It is said that the teachers' salaries are only 330 yuan per month, which, at the current market price, can only buy one large pancake after a month of hard teaching.

Many local villagers are religious, and not a few have converted to Buddhism. What attracts the villagers the most is the Yiguandao. The so-called "Yiguan" means to melt the three religions of Buddhism, Taoism, and Confucianism into one furnace. It is said that the sect sets up altars to preach on the first and fifteenth days of each lunar month. Apart from these devout followers, others are strictly forbidden to visit. The doctrines are mysterious, claiming that believers do not get hit by stray bullets and are invulnerable to swords and spears. This is quite similar to the White Lotus Sect of the Qing Dynasty and the Xiantian Sect of Wuxi, inciting the hearts of the people to the extreme. As for the background of its emergence, the reasons are understandable, but if it is allowed to spread for a long time, the consequences will be disastrous. It is hoped that the relevant military and political authorities will guide it onto the right track to prevent further unrest.

Rampant Gambling

The establishment of tea houses in the area is like bamboo shoots after rain, because the villagers use tea houses as gambling venues. Mixed in them are local thugs and rascals, and people from all walks of life, shouting and gambling all night long. The stakes in a single game can amount to millions of dollars. Losers are not stingy, and this kind of all-or-nothing style is said to be commonplace. As a result, many people have ruined their families, lost their reputations, and committed suicide. Open gambling occurs, but the military and police organs turn a blind eye, raising various questions.

High Prices

The prices in Luodian are as high as in Shanghai. White rice has risen to 800,000 yuan, fresh meat is 4,000 yuan per jin, and vegetables are as high as 1,000 yuan per jin. The prices of daily necessities are even more astonishing. This may be facilitated by illegal taxes.

### Advisory Council Decides to Organize a Committee for Regulating Food Supply, Planning to Raise 10 Billion Yuan to Procure Coarse Grains

The Municipal Advisory Council, in view of the fact that the people's food supply in the city during this lean period must rely on coarse grains to supplement it, and according to recent surveys, the reserves of coarse grains in the producing areas are relatively abundant, and after contacting the relevant agencies, if it is possible to find ways to procure them, it can be used to supplement the city's food supply. However, dealing with large quantities of coarse grains involves issues such as funds, transportation, and security, which cannot be handled by a small number of grain merchants. Only by forming another group can we concentrate our efforts to procure the grains. Therefore, on June 27, the Standing Committee of the Municipal Advisory Council and the Essential Commodities Subcommittee held a joint meeting to discuss this issue. It was decided to organize a Shanghai Special Municipality Committee for Regulating Food Supply to be responsible for implementation, and Li Sihao, Hu Zewu, Liu Xingchen, Zhu Boquan, Xiang Kangyuan, Jin Xiongzi, Sun Dong, Xi Ai Lu, Chen Binxian and other nine people were appointed as members. It is also planned to raise 10 billion yuan, with 500,000 yuan as a unit, with half of the funds subscribed by private entities, and the remaining half expected to be raised by the municipal government for general distribution.

### Government Employees in Various Counties of the City Decide to Distribute Rice as Salary, Using Funds for Relief in the Same Way as the Urban Areas

The salaries of government employees, police officers, and teachers in various county-run schools under the city are low, and their lives are difficult. In order to ensure that they can serve with peace of mind, the relevant departments were previously ordered to convene relevant departments, the Finance Bureau, and county administration management agencies to discuss the issue of distributing rice as salary free of charge, in order to treat them the same as the urban areas and use funds for relief. After deliberation, a distribution plan was formulated, jointly signed and approved, and then issued to the county administrative meeting on June 15 for discussion. The meeting first designated attendees to review the plan, proposed review opinions, and submitted them to the meeting for resolution. The revised plan was passed according to the review opinions, and the County Administration Office submitted the resolution and other documents to the municipal government for approval. The order has now been approved and the County Administration Office has recorded the case and notified the counties to follow the plan. The contents of the plan are excerpted as follows:

Government employees, police officers, and teachers in various county governments and affiliated agencies and county-run schools should, like government employees in various bureaus and offices under the municipal government, be given three dou of rice per person per month free of charge, starting from February of this year.

The free distribution of rice to government employees, police officers, and teachers in various county governments and affiliated agencies and county-run schools shall be carried out in accordance with the following standards:

(A) Those directly appointed by the municipal government.

(C) Those directly appointed by the Municipal Finance Bureau or other bureaus and offices of the municipal government, whose positions, personnel, and salaries are all included in the establishment and reported to the Finance Bureau or other bureaus and offices for transmission to the municipal government.

Each county government or financial agency under the counties of this city shall prepare a roster separately in accordance with the points referred to in the second item (the positions and salaries must be included), in six copies. The county government shall send the roster to the County Administration Office, and the financial agency shall send it to the Finance Bureau for separate verification and submission to the municipal government for approval of the standard for rice distribution. The aforementioned roster shall be delivered by July 15.

Part-time personnel who have already received rice from one agency shall not receive it from another agency.

Those who hold honorary positions in the county government or its affiliated agencies, such as village and township chiefs, and autonomous personnel, as well as micro-collection personnel of the county's financial agencies, such as those who are local village and township chiefs or temporarily employed, and are paid public funds under the commission item, shall not be eligible for rice distribution.

The retroactive distribution of rice before June and the distribution of rice shall be limited to employees who are in office. Those who have left their positions will no longer be compensated.

After the implementation of this principle, all allocations of rice in various counties shall be stopped.

Various counties are preparing to start collecting in-kind taxes. In accordance with Article 20 of the Provisional Regulations on the Collection of In-Kind Taxes on Land, all rice collected as tax shall be stored in warehouses and await orders from the municipal government for disposal. Before receiving orders, it shall not be used without authorization.

Are You a "Lucky One"?

By Gao Ying

—Impressions of the Joint Graduation Ceremony of Municipal Schools—

"...You are truly the lucky ones. In times as tense as these, and with life as difficult as it is, that you students are still able to study in peace and attend this graduation ceremony can be said to be a great favor from your families and society. How should you invigorate yourselves and how should you repay this!"

These were the words spoken by Secretary-General Luo of the Shanghai Municipal Government yesterday morning at the joint graduation ceremony of municipal primary and secondary schools held at the Great Light Cinema, representing the Mayor, in his address to the more than two thousand primary and secondary school graduates.

Indeed, in these times of widespread war and suffering, when people are struggling to survive even with the most basic and rudimentary ways of life, this group of young men and women attending this graduation ceremony are undoubtedly the lucky ones of the era.

Yesterday, the last day of June, the scorching sun raged and the heat was intense. Long before the start of the meeting - 9:30 a.m. - teams of primary and secondary school students arrived on foot, none of them without sweat streaming down their backs due to the heat, appearing very tired.

These primary school students, panting and sweating, stepped into the theater, their faces showing joy and ease. Thinking about the thirst for education and the situation of the so-called "lucky ones," it seems that one can understand their situation from the faces of people on the streets and corners who are holding gun-shaped biscuits and gnawing on them.

I remember last summer, when the second joint graduation ceremony of municipal primary and secondary schools was held at the same location, Acting Chairman Chen (then in the capacity of Mayor) personally presented awards and delivered a speech. In his speech, there was such a passage: "...Our organization is not strict and strong enough, and our ordinary national life is not profound enough, so society has become so chaotic and discipline has deteriorated so much. These are the current phenomena, and we must not let the second generation continue like this. This responsibility lies on the shoulders of all teachers and all our little brothers and sisters..."

These little brothers and sisters are our second generation, our successors. Isn't what Acting Chairman Chen hoped for last year exactly what we all hope for? The graduation ceremony of primary and secondary schools deserves our attention. When previous ceremonies were held, the highest civil official of the city attended in person, and the reason is very obvious.

At half-past nine, the entire Great Light Cinema was packed with a sea of heads, and almost all two thousand seats in the theater were "full." The national flags were displayed in pairs, with a portrait of the Premier hanging high in the middle. In front of the hall, there were ten or so chairs, divided into a seat for officials and a seat for VIPs. On the large table in the center, there were two bottles of fresh flowers on either side, with bright colors. The center was piled with four bundles of graduation certificates, and in front of the table, there was a row of twenty or so pots of flowers and plants, reflecting the light, the green shadows dripping, giving a feeling of coolness.

In the left corner, the lid of a "Piana" piano had already been opened. The meeting order was posted on the wall. In addition to the first five or six items, such as the opening [ unclear], reading, instructions, and speeches, the main part of the second half was the farewell speeches given by male and female student representatives, and the Mayor's awarding of graduation certificates to representatives of the four schools.

In the center of the "main hall" below the stage, the first five rows were the principals' seats. The principals of each school sat there elegantly, either fanning themselves or waving their hats, trying to get some breeze from the warm currents of the crowd. To the right of the principals' seats was the press seat, and to the left was the police band. The musicians in yellow uniforms filled several rows of seats. However, there was plenty of room in the press seat, with many empty seats. Assuming this is the location of profession, then it must be because the life of a journalist is too poor!

At forty past nine, at the sound of rising, Secretary-General Luo had already [surrounded] the stage. From order of one, two, three items…in sequence down, Secretary-General Luo made a speech on behalf of the Mayor. To sum it up, there were two points in his speech: Shanghai's environment is too bad, and young people often go astray, so they should exert their own strength and work hard to transform and build it. Striving to modernize China and become perfect citizens to fight together for the future of the world. In addition, he expressed his gratitude to the school principals and teachers present, and apologized to the students and their parents, fearing that there were many places that were simple and crude. With earnest words and valuable advice. (To be continued)
