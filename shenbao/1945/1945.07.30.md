### Prime Minister Suzuki of Japan Meets with Reporters, Discusses Wartime Policy, Disregards the Three-Power Joint Declaration

Tokyo, 29th (Central News Agency) - Prime Minister Suzuki met with reporters at 3 p.m. today. The interview lasted for an hour. He answered various questions and revealed his firm belief in the government's policy for dealing with the decisive battle phase on the home front. The question-and-answer content is as follows:

(Question) There seems to be a desire among the people for the government to retaliate against enemy naval bombardments of the homeland and air raids by enemy mobile units. What is the Prime Minister's view of the war situation?

(Answer) Regarding this point, the various ministries have recently discussed it. From the perspective of encouraging the people's will to fight, the military has its own plans regarding this point and is currently conducting operations based on this view. Therefore, please wait for developments. This is what the Chief of the General Staff told me. I have responded that we can temporarily disregard the people's concerns and do our best to carry out the operations most conducive to combat. Personally, I hope that the people will have absolute trust in the military regardless of how the war situation develops. At the same time, the operations department has very strong confidence. Please be assured that there are no worries behind. I also deeply feel the great responsibility, so I am constantly thinking and striving for the best. I hope that all 100 million compatriots will do their best in their respective positions and be loyal to their duties.

(Question) What does the Prime Minister think of the Three-Power Joint Declaration?

(Answer) In my opinion, the Three-Power Joint Declaration is nothing more than a repetition of the Cairo Conference. The government does not recognize any value in it and will simply ignore it and strive to complete the war.

(Question) The food problem is becoming increasingly serious due to reduced rations. What is the Prime Minister's view?

(Answer) The government has been trying in various ways to solve the food problem. However, although the ration has been reduced by 10%, it is not because the war situation has become so tense that a 10% reduction must be implemented immediately, but rather as a precautionary measure. I hope that the people will fully assist the government's policies. The government will certainly redouble its efforts to make the people's efforts more effective.

(Question) At this critical juncture in the war, it seems important to strengthen the government's political power.

(Answer) Regarding the strengthening of political power, we have previously implemented a decisive battle system and promulgated strong emergency measures so that various policies can be quickly implemented. Secondly, we have delegated the authority of the central government to the local government-general offices and implemented policies based on the strength of the National Volunteer Corps. All of these are indications of the government's efforts to strengthen political power.

(Question) Issues such as currency inflation and rising living consciousness should be based on the establishment of morality. Therefore, securing the most basic necessities of life should be a prerequisite. What is the Prime Minister's view on this?

(Answer) The establishment of morality should be preceded by securing the basic necessities of life. The government, as mentioned earlier regarding the food problem, is making its best efforts to secure the minimum essential food supply for the people. We are hoping for a good harvest this autumn, and we plan to restore previous rations as much as possible after the new grain is harvested. Fortunately, everyone has a considerable stock of clothing, so we should be able to get through this winter safely. The government has also taken measures to prepare for the winter.

(Question) Enemy air raids are increasing day by day, and damage to factories is increasing. The people are undoubtedly worried about the production status of military supplies and aircraft. What is the Prime Minister's view?

(Answer) Regarding this point, because various parties are working diligently, underground factories have achieved more success than expected. I recently visited them and am confident that there is no need to worry. Some factories seem to have taken action later than others, for which I apologize. However, from now on, we expect to increase production considerably. I cannot tell you how much production capacity we have now. However, I can tell you that the current production capacity has already exceeded the degree of concern and imagination of the people. Thousands of aircraft are manufactured every month. Now, most of them are underground factories, and the workers are working safely, which improves manufacturing efficiency. Some people are worried about the air circulation in the underground factories, but after asking, I learned that there are no problems with nine-hour workdays. The female workers are also very lively and engaged in production, and their health is excellent, which greatly increases work efficiency.

### Recent Two Weeks of Air Combat Results: Japanese Forces Destroy 418 Enemy Aircraft

Tokyo, 29th (Central News Agency) - Enemy mobile units have been lurking in the waters near the homeland since July 10th, stubbornly provoking the Japanese air force at bases. The enemy's disregard for Japan is extremely anxious. A portion of the enemy's ships are conducting naval bombardment, and they are also attempting to destroy transportation facilities, etc., clearly showing an intent to conduct preliminary operations for the next phase of combat. In response, the Japanese forces are conducting courageous counterattacks in various locations with fighters and ground fire. From the 21st to the 25th, they shot down 150 enemy carrier-based aircraft and destroyed 28 ships. Since July 10th, they have shot down a total of 275 aircraft and destroyed 143 ships, for a total of 418 aircraft. The target of the Japanese air force's counterattacks has been mostly enemy carrier-based aircraft this week, so the number of B-29 aircraft shot down is relatively small.

### B-29 Aircraft Raid the Tokaido Region of Japan

Tokyo, 29th (Central News Agency) - Approximately 120 B-29 aircraft launched incendiary bomb attacks on Hirakata City, Fukushima Prefecture, and its surrounding areas starting at 8:30 p.m. on the 28th, causing fires. The Japanese people's air defense units actively suppressed the fires. In addition, approximately 60 B-29 aircraft invaded the vicinity of Wakayama City at around 1:00 p.m. on the 28th, and approximately 160 other aircraft invaded the Tokaido region and dropped bombs on some cities.

### B-32 Aircraft Begin Use by United States

Lisbon, 28th (Central News Agency) - According to a Washington dispatch, the U.S. Department of the Army announced on the 28th that the U.S. Army Air Forces' new bomber, the B-32, has now begun to be used and is participating in the war against Japan under the command of General George Kenney's air force.

### National Strengthening of the National Volunteer Corps in Japan

Tokyo, 29th (Central News Agency) - Since its inception, the Japanese National Volunteer Corps has been active throughout the country, working hard on building fortifications, evacuation work, revitalizing war-torn areas, increasing food production, and cooperating in transportation. As the decisive battle phase is approaching, the Ministry of Home Affairs has formulated the "Implementation Guidelines for Encouraging the Morale of the National Volunteer Corps" yesterday to strengthen its activities, requesting the local general government offices and the National Volunteer Corps Headquarters (i.e., the local governors) to implement it. The main points of the communication are: 1. To encourage the spirit of the Volunteer Corps; 2. To implement the mission of the Volunteer Corps; 3. To organize the ranks of the combat troops.

### Fierce Counterattacks by Japanese Forces North of Davao, Philippines; Fighting on the Right Bank of the Chindwin River, Burma

Tokyo, 29th (Central News Agency) - The war situation in various areas over the past week is as follows: 1. In the South Pacific, the battle line from Balikpapan to Samarinda is at a stalemate. After receiving Australian reinforcements, the enemy is constantly disrupting the Japanese front lines with artillery fire and bombing, and is attempting to continue advancing with a small force. However, the Japanese air force is also cooperating with ground combat, and is currently fighting the enemy fiercely. 2. In the Philippines, fighting is still ongoing in the area north of Davao. Because of the fierce Japanese counterattacks, the enemy has stopped its frontal offensive and is trying to find weaknesses in the Japanese forces. 3. In the East Indian Ocean, after the enemy shelled Phuket Island in Thailand on the 25th, a part of them began landing on landing craft at around 9:00 p.m. However, the Japanese forces intercepted them at sea, inflicting heavy damage and forcing them to retreat. The enemy force was a British fleet based on two cruisers. At around 3:00 p.m. on the 26th, part of the enemy landed again near the southern end of Phuket Island, but was again forced to retreat by the Japanese forces. At 9:00 p.m. that evening, Japanese special attack aircraft attacked enemy ships, sinking one large cruiser and damaging one aircraft carrier or large cruiser. However, enemy ships are still cruising in the nearby waters. 4. In Burma, enemy counterattacks near the Chindwin River are gradually increasing. The rainy season has begun in the area. However, the enemy is using fighters to cover the counterattacks of ground troops, but the Japanese forces are still able to maintain the stronghold on the right bank of the Chindwin River and are currently fighting.

### Japanese Air Force Cooperates in Balikpapan Battle

Southern Base, 29th (Central News Agency) - On the 26th and 27th, the Japanese Air Force cooperated in the ground battle of Balikpapan, attacking enemy positions and material accumulation points, and achieving significant results. On the 26th, at dawn, all the bombs were dropped on the enemy's material accumulation points, inflicting heavy damage. On the 27th, they braved the enemy's fierce anti-aircraft fire and attacked the rear of the enemy's positions. All Japanese aircraft returned safely.

Southwest Pacific Base, 29th (Central News Agency) - Due to fierce counterattacks in Balikpapan, active operations are not possible. The enemy's first-line forces are only conducting preliminary battles and are currently building fortifications between 10 and 14 kilometers east of Samarinda. The Japanese forces have dispatched raiding parties day and night, causing great losses to the enemy.

### Japanese Special Attack Forces Crash into Enemy Ships off Phuket Island

Southern Front Base, 29th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese special attack squadron, attacking the enemy mobile unit that came to attack Phuket Island, displayed fierce power, sinking one cruiser and damaging one large ship of the enemy's main force. The situation has been reported to the base. The Japanese special attack squadron had been accumulating strength and waiting for an opportunity to attack the enemy since the 24th. On the afternoon of the 26th, they suddenly launched an attack in bad weather. When one aircraft broke through, it was hit by enemy fire and did not succeed. However, the situation at this time did not allow for hesitation. In the evening, the special attack squadron departed from the base again. When they flew over the enemy fleet, the weather was still very bad, making the attack difficult. At 8:50 p.m., Petty Officers Takanaga and Yamamoto each piloted an aircraft and crashed into a cruiser and a large ship, respectively, achieving success. Afterwards, reconnaissance by Lieutenant Nakajima's aircraft confirmed that the large ship that had been damaged was likely an aircraft carrier, and it soon sank.

### U.S. Battleship "California" Damaged in Philippine Waters

Lisbon, 29th (Central News Agency) - According to a Washington dispatch, the U.S. Navy Department announced the following on the 27th: The battleship "California" was heavily damaged by a Japanese special attack aircraft attack on January 9th in the Philippine waters and is currently undergoing repairs at the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard. The casualties among its personnel were 45 killed, 110 wounded, and 3 missing.

### My Belief in Certain Victory (2)

— Yoshiida Toyu

Q: You say that the level of capitalist development in China and Japan is not very different. However, Japan's commerce and industry are much more developed, and their level cannot be compared with China. Is it not for this reason that China is resisting the entry of Japanese capitalism into China?

A: Of course, simply speaking, there is a considerable difference in the level of capitalist development between China and Japan. However, we can see that compared with other capitalist countries, especially with Britain and the United States, the difference in the level of capitalist development between China and Japan is not very large. The relationship between the two is what is called "brothers in distress." No, China and Japan in this sense can be called "brother" countries. To better understand this fact, please see the following statistical table.

Comparison of Iron Ore Production Between Britain, the United States, and China/Japan (Essential for Modern Industry)

United States 73,028,000 tons

Britain 18,900,000 tons

Manchukuo 1,070,000 tons

China 250,000 tons

Japan (Mainland and Korea) 828,000 tons

Pig Iron Production

Britain and India 9,100,000 tons

United States 41,900,000 tons

Manchukuo 500,000 tons

China 500,000 tons

Japan and Korea 1,900,000 tons

Steel Production

United States 56,430,000 tons (1929)

Britain 9,840,000 tons (1935)

Japan 4,600,000 tons

China 200,000 tons

Coal Production

United States 552,000,000 tons

Britain 262,000,000 tons

Japan 40,000,000 tons

China 100,000,000 tons

(Among the above statistics, the Chinese figures are based on Kasarin's statistics, while the others are based on Atlier's statistics)

As for electricity, Japan has hydroelectric power, but China's electricity is basically non-existent. As for oil production, neither China nor Japan produces enough to mention.

Power and energy sources such as coal, oil, and electricity can replace human labor to do work. If the amount of work done is converted into the amount of work done by human labor, one can see how similar the situation is between Japan and China. According to Litte's research, when two pounds of coal are used effectively, they can equal one person's day of labor. Assuming that 3.5 barrels of oil equal one ton of coal, comparing the mechanical and power work done by each person in each country yields the following figures:

Americans: 36 people's worth of work per year

British: 24 people's worth of work per year

Germans: 15 people's worth of work per year

Japanese: 2.2 people's worth of work per year

Chinese: 1.2 people's worth of work per year

(Other countries omitted)

There are also very similar phenomena in the industries of China and Japan. That is, the light industries of both countries are more developed than other industries, and there are more small factories with very few workers or apprentices in the light industries, that is, the so-called "Manufacturers" that appeared in the early stages of capitalist development, than large factories. According to Japanese economist Takahashi Kichi, approximately 46% of the total number of industrial workers in Japan are employed in small factories - or rather, workshops - with no more than five workers. According to a 1924 survey, in modern industrial cities like Osaka, approximately 68% of the 19,000 factories, or 13,000, employ five or fewer workers. Although there are no clear statistics for China, according to Kasarin's survey, 85% of cotton yarn and 40% of raw silk are processed by hand looms, and more than 50% of domestic consumption of cotton textiles is accounted for by household labor. It is said that even in modern industrial cities like Shanghai, the number of "manufacturers" reaches twice the number of factories.

Japan and China are called the most advanced countries in Asia, but the level of industry is only so-so. The situation in India is even worse. I think that the reason why China and Japan should jointly consider the liberation of Asia and the economic co-prosperity of Asia lies in this. Some people in Japan often lose sight of the great goal of liberating Asia because Japan's industry is slightly more advanced than China's, and they are working to colonize China in the same way as Britain and the United States, which is regrettable. However, as mentioned above, Japan, China, and India all have similar economic characteristics, that is, many feudal ideas remain inside, and they are externally oppressed by British and American imperialism. The possibility of realizing the "Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere" idea only exists if China and Japan start from how to deal with this state. When this view dominates Japan, China will support Japan and seriously consider the "East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere" issue again. At this time, a close Sino-Japanese partnership will be formed, and the Japanese should realize that to defeat Britain and the United States, this revolutionary partnership between China and Japan is the most reliable method. Because the success of Chinese nationalism predetermines the success of Indian autonomy and independence. India's liberation from Britain directly affects the fall of the British Empire. The fall of the British Empire is the day when the whole of Europe is liberated from British and American capitalism. American capitalism has already developed to the point where it cannot exist without a world market, so if it loses the European market and the Asian market, it cannot but fall with it. I am convinced that this is the most reliable path to "certain victory" left for Japan. (The End) (Translated by Zhao Ming)

Editorial

### Uphold a Firm and Just Stance

With the Three-Power Conference as the center, the British and American sides have recently been constantly planning a "peace offensive" against East Asia, culminating in the so-called Truman-Churchill-Chiang Kai-shek Joint Declaration issued a few days ago.

There are reasons behind the recent "peace offensive" launched by the British, American, and Chongqing sides. The main ones are: 1. After the end of the European War, the war sentiment within Britain and the United States has greatly decreased. The United States is busy dealing with post-war unemployment and is quite impatient with the continued war in the Far East, hoping to end the war as soon as possible. The situation in Britain is also the same. Just look at the Conservative Party's crushing defeat in the recent general election to see how high the British people's anti-war sentiment is. 2. The East Asian war situation, on the contrary, shows a tendency to prolong. Judging from the duration of the Battle of Okinawa and the heavy losses suffered by the American side, one can imagine how Britain and the United States can continue to wage this "nameless war" from thousands of miles away. It is self-contradictory to their propaganda of building a united nation and safeguarding so-called peace and security, so they intend to seek an early end. 3. The conflicts between the Chongqing and Communist sides within China are intensifying. Although Chongqing still boasts about the general counter-offensive on the surface, it is actually eager to establish peace with Japan in order to fully deal with the CCP. This point is also tacitly supported by the United States, because in order to save its domestic economic crisis after the war, Britain must maintain an absolute advantage in investment and sales markets in China, and must obtain various raw materials from China. All of this is hindered by the active strength of the Communist Party. Therefore, ending the East Asian war is actually a prerequisite for completely eliminating the CCP.

However, the British, American, and Chongqing sides are very wrong about the methods and means of ending the East Asian war. They are still arrogant, disregarding the facts, and proposing so-called "unconditional surrender." The eight points of the joint declaration transmitted by foreign wires are actually a disguised version of the conditions for Germany. This extremely unequal declaration disregards Japan's position in East Asia and its current military strength in the entire Pacific region, and violates Japan's just purpose of engaging in the Greater East Asia War. It is a natural result that it is not worthy of consideration by the Japanese authorities and is simply ignored. What is particularly noteworthy is that despite the various activities and provocations by the British, American, and Chongqing sides, the Soviet Union still insists on its position of abiding by the Japan-Soviet Neutrality Pact and refused to list this joint declaration against Japan at the Three-Power Conference. Its future can still be noted.

As far as our country is concerned, Chairman Chen Dai's statement to the Japanese press corps on the afternoon of the 28th stated that no matter how the war situation develops, the National Government's determination will not waver. This firm stance is the stance that we and Japan, as allies, should have. Not only should we in China uphold this firm stance, but also all East Asian countries. In order to oppose the revival of imperialist rule in East Asia and to fulfill the historical mission of East Asians in East Asia, we further hope that all East Asian peoples will uphold the firm stance declared by Chairman Chen Dai, cooperate closely with our allies to the end, and implement the war to achieve the goal of the Greater East Asia.

However, upholding this firm stance must not only be a common belief and determination, but also an active practice. After this "peace offensive" by Britain and the United States fails, they will inevitably concentrate their strength in an attempt to succeed. Therefore, the future development of the East Asian war situation will inevitably be a hundred times more tragic than in the past. In particular, the landing invasion of American troops in the coastal areas of our country is inevitable. The bombing of the major cities along the coast, especially Shanghai, will also be carried out on a large scale. We should make full preparations for this, strengthen our defense posture as one government and people, and earnestly cooperate with our allies. At the same time, those who do not need to reside in Shanghai and other major cities, especially charitable organizations, educational, academic, and cultural institutions, should evacuate as soon as possible. The situation is dangerous and urgent. Please do not fantasize or wait and see any longer!

### US Secretary of War Stimson Impeached by Congressmen

Lisbon, 29th (Central News Agency) – Truman, after the Potsdam Conference, may implement a second cabinet reshuffle, and Secretary of War Stimson is rumored to be the target. According to sources in Washington, Democratic Congressman Long Yu on the 24th stubbornly demanded in the House of Representatives for the immediate dismissal of Stimson and Under Secretary of War Patterson, claiming that Stimson and Patterson were instilling their "communist philosophy" into the US Army. The House Un-American Activities Committee has recently received frequent letters of protest from ordinary soldiers, claiming that there are soldiers with communist ideas in the army attempting to communize the military.

### Britain Maintains Close Ties with the US and Soviet Union – Attlee Clarifies Basic Policy

Lisbon, 29th (Central News Agency) – According to news from London: Before leaving to attend the Potsdam Conference, the new British Prime Minister Attlee held a closed-door meeting with key members of Parliament. During the meeting, Prime Minister Attlee clarified the consistent basic policy of the Labor Party, which is to maintain close ties with the United States and the Soviet Union, and the Labor Party is determined to enable the newly elected Parliament to implement the aforementioned policy. Reuters' political reporter said that Prime Minister Attlee stated during the meeting that he intends to bring young British people into his new government.

### Reasons for the Conservative Party's Disastrous Defeat in the Election

Lisbon, 29th (Central News Agency) – According to news received here: Leader of the British House of Commons and President of the Senate, Morrison, made a speech in London, stating that the Conservative Party's failure in the recent British general election was self-inflicted, and that Churchill's leadership of the party made the failure even more inevitable. History will record the Conservative Party's comprehensive and devastating defeat in the 1945 British general election, which reflects the clear judgment of voters across Britain. At the same time, history will record that Churchill made significant contributions to his country, but ultimately suffered electoral defeat. Historically, the British Conservative Party has often shown excessive cleverness, believing that elections do not necessarily depend on public opinion, but in reality, public opinion can indeed determine the outcome of elections. The Conservative Party believed that the number of people with ideas in Britain in 1945 would not exceed that in 1935 and 1918, but in fact, the general middle class had already shifted their political views to a resolute policy.

### World Federation of Trade Unions to Convene in Paris in September

Central News Agency – According to TASS, Paris: The Secretary-General of the World Federation of Trade Unions, which will be held in Paris in mid-September, recently announced that he has received notifications from all countries that previously participated in the World Federation of Trade Unions conference held in London, expressing their intention to participate. However, it is still unknown in what form the Latin American countries will attend. The Chairman of the Latin American Federation of Labor, Toledano, has notified that the Latin American trade unions have decided to participate in the Paris conference, but it is unclear whether each country will send one representative or whether the trade unions of each country will send representatives separately, as this issue is closely related to the membership fees that each participant must pay. The Irish Trade Union Congress has no funds, so the Secretary-General is considering whether it is possible to reduce the membership fees paid under certain circumstances. At the same time, new requests for permission to participate in the conference have been received, such as the Australian Trade Union Congress's desire to participate in this conference, and the Congolese Trade Union of Belgium's request to be invited to participate in the conference as an independent organization.

### Gaoyou on the Grand Canal

— Yifei

After staying in Yangzhou for three days, the reporter set off on the 5th of this month to inspect Gaoyou. On the same day, at noon, he boarded a small steamboat at the steamboat pier of the Inner River Company outside Fuyun Gate, and went upstream along the Grand Canal.

Current Situation of the Grand Canal

This world-famous "Grand Canal", which once had a romantic legend, has now become a major artery of transportation in central China. The section of the canal that the reporter passed and saw this time is a section of the Li Canal, that is, the entire section of the canal in the area under the jurisdiction of the Subei Pacification Headquarters. It starts from Guazhou in Jiangdu and ends at Huangpu in Shiying, with a total length of 135 kilometers. According to the shipping of this section of the canal, its value for agricultural irrigation is the best in the entire canal, but in the past, this section of the canal was also the most prone to flooding, and the repair and management projects of the river itself were the most difficult in the entire canal. This is due to the terrain. This section of the Li Canal is connected to the Gao Bao Shaobo Lakes in the west and adjacent to the counties of the Lixia River in the east. It is the tail end of the Zhun Yi Si Mo and other rivers entering the Yangtze River. Every time it floods in autumn, when the river and lakes are full, the water level in the west of the canal often exceeds the ground level in the east of the canal by more than two zhang. Therefore, if the water cannot be discharged in time, a huge disaster will occur. Therefore, the current hidden dangers of the canal should not be ignored by anyone, and its degree of danger is even greater today. Currently, the wartime environment is special, the national treasury is not abundant, and the canal dredging and embankment protection work has been suspended for a long time. The river embankments on both sides seen by the reporter this time have already become uneven and almost riddled with holes.

A Glimpse Along the Way

After the boat traveled for an hour, it arrived at the first major station of Quanqian, "Shatou Town". Some passengers got on and off, so it docked for a while, and then continued to move forward. Before this, the river was only twenty or thirty zhang wide, but after passing this, it was connected to the mouth of Shaobo Lake, so the river suddenly widened, and the tributaries were crisscrossed, forming a vast expanse of water, with lush grass, which was quite spectacular. After another two and a half hours, it arrived at Shaobo Town. Most of the river embankment in the town is built with huge stones, which is very neat and solid. Shaobo is more than forty li away from Yangzhou, and the market is quite prosperous. There are many transportation companies and local bamboo basket dealers along the coast. A huge ship lock, named "Shaobo Ship Lock", is built in the east of the town. On the day the reporter arrived, the ship lock was not open due to maintenance, and the steamboat had to detour to the northwest. After passing Shaobo Town, the river narrowed again, and the embankments seen along the way were quite high. Under the embankments, there were slopes, about one zhang wide. From time to time, cargo sailing boats in the river were towed by three or five boatmen. What aroused the reporter's suspicion the most was that there was a "River Embankment Highway" parallel to the entire course, but no cars were seen driving on it, and there were few trees on the river embankment. According to common sense, trees can consolidate the embankment, and their value in preventing floods is very great, which is quite puzzling.

At 7:15, the ship arrived at the pier outside the North Gate of Gaoyou, and then disembarked and entered the city, lodging in the Gaosheng Hotel.

City Appearance and Transportation

The city of Gaoyou is quite prosperous, and the streets are more complete than Jiangdu, which is known as a county in northern Jiangsu. According to locals, Colonel Hayashida, the commander of the Allied Garrison in Gaoyou in the 29th year of the Republic (1940), spared no effort in promoting the road administration of Youcheng. At that time, Wang Zhongyi (later the county magistrate), the chairman of the Self-Government Association, was also a talent for construction. Under the overall planning of the two, the existing streets were widened, such as Caiyi Street and Heping Road inside the North Gate, as well as Beimenkou and Beishikou Roads outside the city. In addition, the ring road around the city was also opened at that time. It is said that the public at that time had many complaints about the renovation of the road administration, as it required the use of private land. Only today do they know the contribution of this measure to the rectification of Gaoyou's city appearance and commercial transportation.

Gaoyou's external transportation currently includes the Grand Canal, which can lead to Zhenjiang and Shiying, and the Canal Embankment Highway, which can directly lead to Xuzhou in Huaihai. However, due to environmental reasons, it only reaches Qingpu.

Public Security Situation

Gaoyou County is divided into eight districts. The urban area has large towns, namely Nan Yi Town, Jiahe Town (inside the South Gate), Heping Town (inside the North Gate), and Dongshan Town, Yuwang Town, and Zhuhu Town (outside the North Gate). Gaoyou used to be a first-class county, but due to the harsh environment and the inability to smoothly advance county administration, the jurisdiction has shrunk day by day, and it has been temporarily changed to a second-class county starting this year.

Due to the county government's financial difficulties and frequent military errands, according to the person in charge of the county government, everything that should be done in county administration cannot be promoted according to the expected steps. Various statistical surveys have not yet begun. According to personnel in the local police station, the population of the urban area is about 50,000.

The public security situation in the urban area is relatively stable. In addition to the eighth district (west of the lake), which is entirely a bandit area, the remaining districts can only be partially promoted. Previously, Guo Shimao, the magistrate of this county, wanted to stabilize the county administration of the eighth district, and appointed Wang Shilin as the district chief, who went with the army, taking Guangpei Township and Minqiao Town as the base, and originally planned to gradually advance. However, due to the unfavorable environment, Wang returned in frustration in late May, which is enough to show the severity of the banditry in the area.

Currently, in addition to the Allied Garrison Team in the local county seat, there is also the ×× Division of the Second Righteous Army, which has just been transferred from Funing in mid-April. On the day the reporter arrived, he saw many villagers and women busy repairing the city walls on the head of the Zhisheng Gate (North Gate). At the same time, there were huge slogans on the walls of the streets with the three major guidelines for Sun's administration, namely: Military First, Public Security First; Politics is Important, People's Livelihood is Important; Government-People Cooperation, Civil-Military Cooperation. Since there are bandits within ten li of the city, Sun pays great attention to the public security of Gaoyou.

Public Burden

Before the Incident, Gaoyou had 2,099,769 mu, 3 fen, 8 li of farmland, of which fields producing miscellaneous grains accounted for about 20% of the total, and the rest were rice fields (one season of rice) and "grass fields" (fields along the Tag River). The output of miscellaneous grains and rice in Gaoyou, the local consumption, and the situation of external transportation are roughly as follows:

Item | Output | Price per Dan | Local Consumption | Exportable Amount | Destination
------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | --------
Wheat | 98,530 Dan | 116 | 50,000 Dan | 30,000 Dan | Zhenjiang
Wheat | 704,549 Dan | 149 | 300,000 Dan | 200,000 Dan | Nanjing
Naked Barley | 26,334 Dan | 145 | 12,000 Dan | 10,000 Dan | Nanjing
Soybeans | 45,000 Dan | 200 | 20,000 Dan | 15,000 Dan | Nanjing
Broad Beans | 6,973 Dan | 200 | - | 2,000 Dan | -
Peas | 4,153 Dan | 200 | 3,500 Dan | 1,000 Dan | Nanjing
Mung Beans | 4,000 Dan | 200 | 3,000 Dan | 1,000 Dan | Nanjing
Rice | 1,400 Dan | 142 | 1,200 Dan | 80 Dan | Nanjing Shanghai

The area of farmland currently subject to taxation is only 277,919 mu and 6 fen, and the tax rate is 3 sheng of rice per mu. The county started taxation on December 1 last year, and by June of this year, it had collected a total of 1,320,000 jin.

The county government's tax collection situation is as described above. In addition, the garrison army needs 2,450 dan of rice per month (which used to be borne jointly by the local government and the people, but is now the responsibility of the Subei Pacification Headquarters).

Regarding the burden on the people, for residents in the urban area, they need to pay 10,000,000 yuan per month. The burden on farmers in the countryside varies greatly. Generally, those closer to the urban area, in addition to the 3 sheng of rice per mu for land tax, the total amount of additional levies and rice is about 3 dou per mu per year. Those farther away pay 5 or 6 dou. The procedures for the levy of funds and rice by the garrison army are sometimes handled by the county government, and sometimes by the garrison army in conjunction with the township chiefs. In addition, farmers in the vicinity of the guerrilla area are still subject to a levy of 30 jin of wheat per mu and more than 20 jin of rice per mu.

Severe Food Shortage

Gaoyou has always produced abundant rice, and the people's food supply was originally not a problem. However, after large-scale organized smuggling has been carried out frequently, the stock of grain has been dwindling. According to people in the county government's competent department, there are currently only more than 2,000 dan of grain left in the urban area of Gaoyou, which is hard to believe unless you are there in person.

In April, the best quality rice was only 40,000 yuan per dan. Subsequently, due to large-scale smuggling, the rice price rose sharply, rising by more than 100,000 yuan per day at its peak, reaching a maximum of 460,000 yuan, and wheat was 120,000 yuan per dan. Due to the high rice prices, local residents cannot afford to buy rice and have long been using miscellaneous grains to fill their stomachs. But what is worrying is that at this time of year, locusts are plaguing the area, and more than 50% of the wheat in the fields has been eaten, and rice seedlings have also been affected. When the reporter stayed in Youcheng (from the 5th to the 8th), he happened to be in the midst of a locust plague. The rice fields in the urban area, the eastern and southern townships, and the distant Cheyou Town and the third and fourth districts were all severely damaged. Therefore, the food problem here after the autumn harvest is very worrying.

General Prices

The prices of goods in Gaoyou are also rising gradually. The prices of the main items on July 8 are listed below for reference.

The best quality rice is 460,000 yuan per dan, weighing 195 jin. Wheat is 110,000 yuan per dan. Pork is 3,600 yuan per jin. Candles are 250,000 yuan per box. Sunlight soap is 6,500 yuan per bar. Solid glue is 7,500 yuan per piece. Yin Dan Shi Lin cloth is 9,000 yuan per foot. Ordinary cloth (i.e., produced in Changzhou) is 7,000 yuan per foot.

Education Overview

Local education is quite developed. There are four complete primary schools in the urban area, namely Central, Chengnan, Chengbei, and Xinxiangkou Schools. There is also Chengzhi Primary School, a junior primary school, in the urban area. The school was destroyed in the 27th year of the Republic (1938), and the current school building is newly built.

There is only one county-run middle school, and the school building is quite grand and also newly built. Regarding the treatment of teachers, primary and secondary school teachers all receive 3 dou of rice from the government. Before April, students "contributed rice", which was 1 dou per student per semester, but this has been abolished. Recently, the monthly salary of primary school teachers is only 700 yuan, while the salary of middle school teachers is based on clock hours. In the 33rd year of the Republic (1944), it was 2.5 yuan per hour, and the monthly base salary was 380 yuan, so the monthly salary of middle school teachers is about 1,140 yuan. Currently, the new budget for the 34th year of the Republic (1945) has not yet been approved by the provincial government, so the general education community in Gaoyou is still living a very poor life.

### Financial, Industrial, and Commercial Market Conditions Last Week Remained Highly Volatile – Jin Zhengquan (Gold Certificates) Stocks Rose and Fell Sharply

The financial, industrial, and commercial market conditions in this city have remained highly volatile in the past week. Jin Zhengquan stocks rose and fell sharply, which was unexpected by most people in the industry. Due to the stimulation of international rumors, speculative merchants took advantage of the opportunity to manipulate the market and deceive people, attempting to reap huge profits in the chaos. Therefore, countless ignorant retail investors have suffered.

Gold Certificates

The high and low of gold certificates in a week was 3,000,000 yuan. Although the fluctuation was violent, the closing result was higher than the closing price of the previous week. On Monday, it continued the bullish trend of the previous Saturday, and the opening immediately announced a limit up, at 10,240,000 yuan, a sudden increase of 1,240,000 yuan per tael. Certificate holders insisted on not selling, forming a situation where there was demand but no supply. On Tuesday, it continued to rise sharply, and expiring gold certificates continued to rise by 1,540,000 yuan, at 11,780,000 yuan per tael, with no market for the price. On Wednesday, a certain atmosphere caused the money supply to tighten, and there was a sudden sharp drop. Although the bullish trend was re-ignited in the afternoon, the closing result was still a drop of 1,080,000 yuan compared to the previous day. On Thursday, due to unfavorable news, the bulls continued to decline, and the black market also followed the downward trend. People's hearts became even more depressed, and gold certificates suddenly fell below the 10 million yuan mark, with a closing price of 9,700,000 yuan, and the transaction volume increased by 10 taels compared to the previous day. On Friday and Saturday, due to a certain atmosphere and the fact that the fifth phase of gold certificates had a definite issue date, it was changed to public listing and sold on the market. The opening price was said to be more than 20% lower than the expiring gold certificates. In addition, the money supply continued to tighten, so people's hearts became more and more weak, and the price retreated to the 9,000,000 yuan mark, closing at 8,420,000 yuan. Silver was stable at 50,000 yuan per tael.

Chinese Stocks

Chinese stocks rose sharply in the upper half of the week following the price of gold, and in the lower half of the week, the rise and fall deviated from the price of gold. On Monday, more than 50 stocks continued to rise to the limit following the high price of gold certificates. Although there was an air raid, it was still difficult to suppress the bullish trend. On Wednesday, due to the sudden tightening of the money supply, the bulls came out to sell at high prices, and the market showed a reactionary decline. However, some firmly grounded mid-cap stocks rose to the limit. On Thursday, some market participants sold gold certificates and transferred funds to the stock market to absorb stocks, and the money supply rebounded. Therefore, the stock market rose first and then rose again in the morning, and continued to rise in the afternoon. The transaction volume was frequent again, and both bulls and retail investors were enthusiastically hyped up. On Friday, more and more people abandoned gold for stocks, and stocks rose across the board. On Saturday, due to the scheduled issuance of the fifth phase of gold certificates and changes in bill exchange, the stock market funds were bound to be affected and narrowed, so a selling wind suddenly arose, and there was a reactionary sharp decline. As for the industrial and commercial sectors in the past week, there were few changes.

Rice and Grains

The supply of rice and grains is constant. The market is relatively stable. The market has a sufficient supply of rice, and most ordinary people have switched to eating miscellaneous grains. Recently, rice and grain sales have been sluggish, and market prices have been difficult to rise. However, the market prices of daily necessities such as oil, sugar, soap, candles, matches, fuel, firewood, charcoal, and coal have continued to rise. The prices of goods sold in various companies and shops have also been rising frequently, and the prices are quite inconsistent, with some high and some low. If the economic authorities do not correct this situation, the harm to the citizens will be even greater.

### Last Five Days of Donations – Hoping Readers Will Donate Actively

50 Million Yuan Per Day to Complete the Goal

The fundraising campaign for this newspaper's reader scholarship fund started on the 5th of this month, with a monthly target of 130 million yuan for one month. As of today, five-sixths of the time has passed, and the amount of donations received is only 68 million yuan, which is still a huge shortfall of more than 23 million yuan. Such a result cannot help but make us worry about the more than 3,500 students who are being assisted. However, past facts tell us that every time a fundraising campaign is about to end, we see a hot and competitive donation situation, and there has never been a failure, and there has been a continuous stream of donations after the end. Therefore, we also firmly believe that in the last five days, there will be many caring readers who will send in large donations.

Among our readers, there are many wealthy people with a heart for helping others and compassion. This point has not only been demonstrated in previous scholarship fundraising campaigns, but also in the previous Yuyuan Road fire donation and the ongoing air raid relief donations. Especially this time for the air raid relief donations, in just a very short period of less than ten days, we received nearly 300 million yuan of purely voluntary donations, which fully demonstrates that our readers have great sympathy and mutual assistance.

Our wise and well-organized readers will not neglect the scholarship campaign due to the concentration of attention on air raid relief, or even forget the imminent crisis of nearly 3,500 students losing their schooling.

We firmly believe that the majority of enthusiastic readers of this newspaper will be able to break our estimate of receiving 10 million yuan in donations per day in the next five days, and quickly and smoothly complete the difficult and glorious task of this scholarship fundraising with donations of 50 million yuan per day.

Yesterday, Mr. Yu Chen celebrated his 50th birthday, and donated 100,000 yuan by saving on the banquet expenses. Also, Mr. Ke Qiyu and Mr. Luo Zhijia each donated 100,000 yuan. Sincere thanks are expressed.

As for the opening price of this issue, it is generally speculated that it may be about 20% lower than the price of the already matured gold securities.

### Counterfeit Train Tickets Discovered at the North Station

Following the recent bombing of this city, residents have been returning to their hometowns in droves. Some scalpers, seeing an opportunity, have become active again. The station manager of the North Station, Mei Yuan, fearing that the public will be deceived, made the following statement to reporters: "Recently, some unscrupulous elements have taken advantage of the increase in ticket prices and the surge in the number of people returning to their hometowns, and have dared to forge train tickets, secretly selling them in front of this station or other places. The railway authorities will not be responsible for any losses suffered by passengers. In the future, passengers should go directly to the East Asia Transportation Corporation or the ticket office of this station to

In addition: The station recently established a place at the gate for passengers to express their opinions on station affairs and to report illegal conduct by station staff. In the future, if passengers have any opinions, they can write down their real names and detailed addresses so that the station can investigate. Anonymous letters will not be accepted.

### Banks and Financial Institutions Suspended from Business Will Be Allowed to Resume Operations

### This Office's Small Loan Report for May and June: The Use of Funds is Always Insufficient

This office's small loan fund, in May and June, loaned to a total of fifty units, with a loan amount of 418,000 yuan. Currently, each person is required to borrow 20,000 yuan. The principal is repaid once a month, without interest, and paid off in ten installments. Therefore, even if each borrower can repay monthly, the principal will be fully recovered after ten months. Moreover, in the next ten months, the fund must continue to be loaned out. On the other hand, if prices rise, in order to help the needy, the loan amount has to be increased. Therefore, the circulating use of funds is always insufficient. It is hoped that enthusiastic people will generously donate to enrich the fund, which is an indirect social undertaking to assist the unemployed. The amount of loans in May and June is published as follows:

### Pushan Burial Society to Broadcast for Donations

The Pushan Burial Society has been established for thirty-three years, with the main purpose of collecting and burying unclaimed coffins and abandoned corpses of children. The head office is located on Beihai Road (i.e., Liuma Road). Since its establishment, it has collected and buried 711,211 coffins of various sizes, and distributed 268,597 coffins of various sizes. Before the war, burial grounds were located in the Dachang area, and after the war, in Hongqiao in western Shanghai and Panlong Town in Qingpu. There has never been a fund, and all expenses rely on donations from enthusiastic people. Recently, the price of wood has skyrocketed. A thin-skinned coffin that cost three to five yuan before the war now costs 200,000 yuan. In this hot summer, there are many deaths, and the city is also frequently subjected to air raids, resulting in many casualties. More coffins are needed. It is planned to broadcast for donations in the near future, hoping that philanthropists will generously donate to support this charitable cause.

### Rectifying Temporary Air Raid Shelters

— Xie

This port has been frequently subjected to air raids recently, resulting in many civilian casualties, and the tragic situation is shocking every day. The reason for the disaster, in addition to direct bombing, is that many people were killed or injured due to the collapse of old-style civilian houses. These old-style disaster houses can be found everywhere in the city. If residents in the houses do not take shelter in a safe place during an air raid, they will die from the collapse of the house. Although people are avoiding air raids every day, air raid shelters have been dug everywhere in the city, but they are too shallow and have no shelter on top, making the construction different and impractical. At present, the cost of renovating raw materials is high, which is beyond the reach of social resources. The huge commercial houses, residences, public schools, and temple buildings in this city were previously labeled with the words "Temporary Air Raid Shelter" by the Lianbao Office, so that civilians could take temporary shelter during an air raid, which could indeed reduce the risk of civilians being hit by bullets or crushed to death. Unexpectedly, these labels have mostly disappeared, and some homeowners are unwilling to let strangers enter, and even remove them without authorization. Therefore, when an air raid occurs, the civilians traveling on the streets and the residents of the slums are at a loss and wander around the roadside, inevitably being shot by enemy planes. This hinders the progress of air defense affairs and increases unnecessary sacrifices. It seems that it should be rectified as soon as possible. It is hoped that the relevant authorities will work with Lianbao to quickly re-nail wooden signs to identify public temples, schools, shops, and residential houses with solid houses throughout the city, as temporary civilian shelters during wartime air raids, so as to reduce casualties when the city encounters air raids again.

### Air Raid Rescue Issues

— Qian Zheng

On the 17th of this month, the eastern district was tragically bombed, and the number of deaths and injuries , according to the authorities, the reason is , the number of people who should respond to the people is not , the rapid shelter led to , the rescuer came out , the surgical equipment of ,急 is incomplete, and the negligence of the hospital , and the announcement of death is also a lot. The following is the true story of the author's witnessing: A friend's mother was a guest at a relative's house in Pudong. Unfortunately, on the 17th, she was injured by a bomb. The relatives also shared drinks at that time. Afterwards, the hospitals were searched all over, and there was no news. Later, a telegram was received, knowing that it was in a hospital on Liwan Road. The author also went with them by car to , see the friend's mother moaning in pain, but her consciousness was still clear, saying that "I have been waiting for a long time for the injury, and then I was transported by a truck to the doctor, and when I was admitted to the hospital, I asked for my relative's address and phone number, because I was temporarily unconscious, Zhu can answer, that is, I will disinfect and bandage it slightly, and then give a price, shout it aside, and no one will care. On the contrary, the fellow Yang, who also , informed his family by telephone, and washed and scrubbed the blood on his body, and suppressed it to the extreme. Later, I remembered the phone number, and asked them to call you to come quickly." After asking the medical record, it was said that "the wound is on the right waist, and when I was admitted to the hospital, I immediately , removed the shrapnel and mud, and disinfected it once, but whether there are any residues in the body, because the equipment is incomplete, there is no X-ray, and there is no specialist doctor, so there is no way to measure it." After discussing with my friends, I sent it to Guangci Hospital, and after a medical examination, because the time was too long, I could not have surgery again, so I had to sit and grind to death. The author was heartbroken to witness, so I dare , please the people of insight in the society, find a way to do the following points: After the air raid, mobilize trucks, rush to the scene of the accident, and load the injured. Please the health authorities to quickly investigate the hospital, and those who have specialist doctors and equipment in urgent surgery, order them to serve the refugees, and publish the hospital address in the newspaper, so that the rescue team will have something to transport. Even if there is no specialist doctor or equipment in the hospital, it should also be based on its inherent , and after implementing disinfection and first aid, it should be replaced by a hospital, so as to avoid following the wrong . It is hoped that the rich will enthusiastically donate, and the strong will contribute their efforts, so as to fulfill the obligations of human mutual aid.

### My Opinion on Air Raid Shelters

—

In order to ensure the safety of the city, the authorities have repeatedly promoted the construction of air raid shelters, so air raid shelters are scattered throughout the city's streets and alleys; however, these air raid shelters are dug very simple, and those with lids have collapsed soon, and those without lids! Whether it is to accommodate many people or people, it is either filled with sewage, or it is filled with filth, or it is full of water, mosquitoes are dancing, the stench is steaming, pedestrians cover their noses, it is no different from the dung pits in the fields, and the air defense effect is completely lost. Since the beginning of this summer, it seems that there are more mosquitoes and insects than in previous years, and the epidemic may be more rampant. Most citizens are weak due to lack of nutrition, and if they are attacked by bacteria again, it is really bitter.

In the very special period of , safety first, so-called city and traffic questions of course can not be discussed, although it has been made riddled with holes, and the traps are densely , under the control of lights, pedestrians may fall into it at any time, and that is just because of their own carelessness, and there is nothing to say. The author means that Shanghai Tan was originally soaked in water, and in this terrain, digging air raid shelters is really a chicken to please. Since it is considered that it must be thought of, then it must be done in a famous and true way, so it is better to dig out so many air raid shelters that hide dirt and accept dirt, which are useless to the right and harmful. It is better to return , to build dozens of or hundred , together , standard, and truly practical air raid shelters. Even if the local people , speaking, are absolutely not enough to use , but compared to that , it is nothing more than real, like the air raid shelters that are currently available, you can rest assured, a little bit of view, is not enough to be used by the wise authorities and public leaders to condescend to examine it?

### How to Prevent Tipping Over the Air Raid Shelter Arhat

There are so many air raid shelters in Shanghai streets that there is almost one every five steps and one hole every ten steps. There are many that have been completed, and there are also many that have not been completed. Letting the sewage accumulate, mosquitoes and flies gather, and the stench spreads into the air under the sun, pedestrians cannot help but cover their noses and pass by. This garden has yang hygiene, but what is most likely to harm public safety is the general night walkers. The number of people who tip over into the air raid shelters is not uncommon. That is, the author's male and female colleagues, some of them were seriously injured because of falling, and could not sign in for service, and there were those who held their positions. Also hold pain! Some of their knees are red and swollen, and it is difficult to walk, and they are forced to come to work, and they are always in pain. It is difficult to work with peace of mind. Both people and themselves suffer losses; How to prevent passers-by from tipping over into air raid shelters? It seems to be implemented quickly, and it is not allowed to be neglected. In my humble opinion, the air raid shelters that have not been completed should be erected with red light signs of "Beware of danger", so that passers-by will know what to avoid, and will not mistakenly fall into the trenches. Suffering from the disaster of delusion, I wish my municipal authorities to protect the main government, and I urge you to make a plan.

### Implementation of Emergency Evacuation

— Mu Yun

The city's evacuation committee has been in existence for about several months since its establishment. Although it has been actively working on evacuation matters, due to environmental limitations such as the lack of transportation, financial constraints, and individual problems of various evacuated groups, the actual effectiveness has been minimal.

Under the threat of impending war, the city's environment is deteriorating day by day. Firstly, prices are soaring and there is a shortage of food. Secondly, there is widespread unemployment, making a living difficult. With many mouths to feed and few to produce, it's unknown how long this abnormal situation can be maintained. However, the seriousness of the situation is increasing daily, which cannot be denied.

The city was bombed again a few days ago, resulting in numerous casualties. It is possible that large-scale tragedies will occur again in the future. Therefore, evacuating the population is a matter of urgency. Those who are willing should evacuate as soon as possible, and those who are forced to evacuate should also be implemented promptly to reduce consumption, casualties, and the extent of damage.

The current environment makes choosing difficult, which is also a fact. A few days ago, some people who had voluntarily evacuated back to their hometowns came out of the countryside, saying that the countryside was not peaceful and the cost of living was not much lower than in Shanghai. On the contrary, it was more difficult to make a living. For example, in Shanghai, mending shoes, running a small stall, being a servant, or even begging can at least maintain one's personal livelihood, while in the countryside, there is no way to do so. Therefore, it was reported in the newspapers a few days ago that Shanghai, in the midst of an evacuation movement, was instead experiencing a counter-evacuation, with the population increasing daily. After this bombing, there may be people who voluntarily evacuate again, but I am afraid that after a while, they will quietly return.

To prevent counter-evacuation, we believe that before implementing evacuation, we must first restrict entry. If we only evacuate without restricting entry, the city's population will inevitably leave in one batch, only to return, or be replaced by another batch, which would be equivalent to no evacuation at all. Therefore, we hope that the municipal authorities, while actively promoting evacuation, will implement the following four points to stop unnecessary immigration (excluding births):

Re-verify household registrations. Those without proper employment should be forced to return to their hometowns at their own expense or with assistance. Those who are not residents of this city should be given a deadline to leave.

Restrict travelers to prevent merchants from other places from staying for extended periods.

Restore security in the surrounding countryside so that rural residents can live in peace.

### Suggestion to Save Electricity in Exchange for Tap Water

— Han Du

Recently, cholera has been rampant, and the demand for water for drinking and general use has increased significantly. As a result, many citizens have exceeded their tap water limits and have been fined. Under the pressure of the ever-increasing cost of living, this unexpected threat is truly unbearable.

This newspaper has repeatedly discussed the tap water problem, either suggesting that the authorities increase the limits or advising citizens to conserve. However, neither has been very effective in practice. Here is a suggestion for the authorities, I wonder if it can be adopted? It is known that tap water and electricity originally belonged to the same company. Now that it is mid-summer, the days are long and the nights are short, and citizens' consumption of electricity is optional. However, due to the long and hot summer, the need for tap water will inevitably increase, but they suffer from the limited quota. I think that since tap water and electricity belong to the same company, the company should consider the needs of the citizens and announce a win-win solution: use a certain number of kilowatt-hours of electricity in exchange for a certain number of units of tap water. The number of electricity kilowatt-hours for each household could be converted into tap water quotas, so that what is used for electricity can be used for tap water. This would transform something useless into something useful for citizens. For the company, the cost of electricity production can be transferred to the production of tap water, without increasing expenses. As for income, the electricity fees remain electricity fees, and the tap water fees remain tap water fees, without any reduction. Such a mutually beneficial solution only requires the company to make a public announcement. I don't see any difficult problems to solve, but there may be technical difficulties, which I am not aware of.

### Criticism of Next-Day Clearing of Negotiable Instruments

— Shi Hao

I recently read in the newspaper that "the banking and money exchange industries...the number of negotiable instruments has increased frequently, and the clearing procedures have become increasingly complicated, resulting in an increase in the daily exchange difference and the number of returned instruments...Disputes have also arisen frequently as a result. To solve the problem...they are discussing next-day clearing of negotiable instruments..." Based on this analysis, the cause is the increase in negotiable instruments, the difficulty is the increase in exchange difference and the number of returned instruments, the result is frequent disputes, and the remedial measure is next-day clearing. After careful consideration, it can be found that this remedial measure is not very clever.

First, same-day clearing has nothing to do with the exchange difference, unless some negotiable instruments are left out, but this is related to the management structure and efficiency of each bank. Busy banks naturally need and are able to hire more staff. Therefore, it is extremely unreasonable to resort to next-day clearing for this reason.

Second, most returned instruments are caused by insufficient capital turnover. If next-day clearing is implemented, the capital turnover will be even slower, which will definitely increase the number of returned instruments, so disputes will definitely arise more frequently.

Third, if next-day clearing is implemented, assuming that a bank or money exchange receives a negotiable instrument on the afternoon of one day, because the bank or money exchange is already closed, it can only be deposited on the second day, cleared on the third day, and it will not be known until the fourth day whether it will be returned. If it is not returned, it can only be withdrawn on the afternoon of the fourth day. Counting from the first day to the fourth day, there is a difference of three days. Not counting the interest on the delay, it is extremely inconvenient, which is equivalent to lowering the utilization rate of negotiable instruments. As a result, merchants and citizens will be more afraid of negotiable instruments and want cash. Some merchants and citizens will inevitably discriminate against negotiable instruments and refuse to accept them. As a result, it will indirectly make the practice of discounting more rampant, and small citizens will suffer even more.

Fourth, the difficulty of clearing procedures does not necessarily require next-day clearing. If the clearing time is delayed by one or two hours, and the banks add more staff, or temporarily transfer idle staff to the reconciliation department, it will be easier to close the books on the same day and avoid negotiable instruments being left out. Negotiable instruments must be cleared on the same day. The law has clear provisions, which shows that it has its legal basis and needs. Now there are other methods that are not adopted, and it is necessary to change the legally prescribed same-day clearing to next-day clearing. I don't know what the reason is. Moreover, the current increase in negotiable instruments is a temporary phenomenon. Once the Central Bank provides a large amount of cash, the number of negotiable instruments will decrease.

In short, next-day clearing will inevitably promote the evil practice of discounting and make merchants and citizens feel inconvenient. I hope that the banking and money exchange industries and the Finance Bureau will consider the difficulties of the people and reconsider.

### Strengthening the Credit of Checks

— Mu Gong

The purpose of establishing the check system was originally to avoid the trouble of transferring cash. It is simple, clear, and very convenient to replace it with a check. This system is built on reliable and credible checks. The value of this check must be fully equivalent to its face value, and there is no risk of being dishonored or suffering losses. It is a security with independent credit. However, in our country, the credit of a check completely relies on the credit of the individual, and if separated from the individual, the check has no intrinsic value, even though there are legal regulations. Looking at the market recently, because there is not enough cash, it has to be replaced by negotiable instruments, but its scope is limited to familiar people, so that it can pass without obstacles. Among strangers, there is still a gulf of mistrust, even if they reluctantly accept promissory notes from banks, it is still necessary to copy down the residence certificate. Therefore, negotiable instruments in our country still cannot get rid of the nature of "vouchers." Therefore, the reason for the failure to expand is because checks have been used too poorly in the past.

How can the credit of checks be strengthened? It is to avoid the abuse of checks. This can be said from two aspects:

From the perspective of the drawer, the abuse of checks is often caused by unscrupulous drawers. The reason is that there are no deposits and the checks are used as a tool for deception; there are also cases where the funds have not been received, and the pre-paid checks are not cashed when they are due. Of the above two reasons, the former is fundamentally a rascal, and the latter is equally unfaithful, but still justifiable. For the sake of check usage, it seems that both are unacceptable. It seems that every drawer should cherish his own reputation. For the sake of the entire negotiable instrument system, it should be even better.

From the perspective of banks, according to negotiable instrument regulations, only banks and money exchanges can act as check payers. Therefore, banks and money exchanges are also a key point in strengthening the check circulation plan. In my opinion, the industry should at least pay attention to two points: (A) Strictly handle the opening of current accounts. If a recommendation from a person well-known to the bank is required, otherwise, they may be asked to provide more than two business firms, and after consulting the bank and receiving a reply confirming that they are of good character and have a proper occupation, a checkbook may be issued and allowed to transact. It is absolutely impossible to covet profits and attract customers indiscriminately. If some banks have very small amounts of money to open a check account with a residence permit, under this condition, anyone can have a checkbook in hand. The reliability of such a check is of course difficult to believe. (B) There should be strict sanctions for dishonored checks. If a check is dishonored twice, the transaction should be stopped and the checkbook should be taken back. If some banks only charge a certain handling fee for dishonored checks, it seems that they do not pay enough attention to the credit of checks, or it may cause industrial and commercial circles to dishonor checks in this bank. It is not worth the loss if the problem is not treated effectively.

I believe that if everyone takes the responsibility of strengthening the use of friendly checks on their shoulders, then checks will have no risk of being dishonored, and the trouble of transferring cash can be avoided, and there will be no problem with the circulation of negotiable instruments. Because of the circulation and the many people who sign the old books, the credit of negotiable instruments will tend to be strengthened, which will make checks become a security with independent credit, and everyone can enjoy its convenience. This is not a luxury, perhaps we will find that there is too much cash.
