### The Balikpapan Front Stalemate: Japanese Forces Mount Strong Counterattack; Fierce Cannon Battle on the Samalinda Highway Front

From a forward base in the south, a 21st Central News Agency dispatch reports that Japanese forces in the Balikpapan area continue to fight fiercely. They are currently holding the area near the Wakangan River waterway, a line 8 kilometers east of Samalinda, and the hilly area behind the Sepinngan airfield, preventing the enemy from advancing. Due to the ingenious Japanese battle plan, enemy casualties are increasing daily, and the front is in a stalemate. Although the Wakangan River waterway temporarily fell into enemy hands, Japanese forces immediately launched a night attack, wielding swords and decimating the enemy troops there, retaking the territory. The enemy widely admits to the difficult battle conditions, saying: the Japanese counterattacks are extremely strong, the front is now completely stalemated, and casualties are soaring. Several enemy small aircraft have begun landing at Sepinngan airfield, but the enemy fears Japanese night attacks, and the areas around the material warehouses are brightly lit at night. Furthermore, near the Anakitara pier on the Balikpapan coast and near the Nirashi mountain area, the enemy is urgently constructing defensive positions. Japanese soldiers are now utilizing their sweat and blood-forged rich reserves of fuel and various new weapons to destroy enemy positions. In particular, in areas where Japanese forces are stationed, many enemy soldiers have been killed, so the enemy is intimidated by the power of Japanese weapons and their morale is declining daily.

From a southwestern Pacific base, a 21st Central News Agency dispatch reports that on the Balikpapan front, on the 15th, enemy forces attacking the Samalinda highway front engaged in fierce fighting with two enemy platoons around 7:00 PM that afternoon, annihilating one platoon. The enemy forces shelled Japanese positions with mortars, tank cannons, and field guns throughout the day, but made no significant progress. Also, at the Lianshan area, around 7:30 PM that afternoon, Japanese forces annihilated approximately 50 enemy soldiers. Enemy forces on other fronts also showed no significant activity. Japanese forces are engaging in intense close-quarters combat daily.

### Newspaper Article Discusses: Homeland Air Supremacy

### Quietly Awaiting the Opportunity to Strike Back

A 21st Central News Agency dispatch from Tokyo reports that recently, enemy aircraft and fleets have wantonly ravaged the Japanese homeland, causing Japanese citizens to gnash their teeth in anger. However, the Japanese military has not simply stood by and watched this arrogant enemy run rampant. Regarding this, the Yomiuri Shimbun featured a "Homeland Decisive Battle Theory" on the 20th, and the Asahi Shimbun published opinions on the front page on the 19th. The Yomiuri Shimbun stated that B-29 heavy bombers will increasingly attack Japan in the future, but Japan's homeland air supremacy has absolutely not been surrendered to the enemy. Even if the Japanese homeland is under constant bombing by enemy aircraft, forcing 100 million Japanese citizens to be impoverished and live in the mountains and caves, facing the worst possible situation, we still firmly believe that control of the Japanese homeland's skies is firmly in the hands of the Japanese military and will be fought to the end. Indeed, to achieve their ambition of seizing air supremacy, the enemy will rely on its material advantage to challenge us to a war of attrition. At the same time, in order to deplete Japanese air combat strength, they will frequently raid us. Therefore, in some areas, Japanese air supremacy may appear weak, or Japanese air combat may temporarily lack vigor. However, because Japanese air combat strength is already at a disadvantage, we must wait for a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to engage the enemy and avoid unnecessary waste. Regarding enemy aircraft invading the homeland, we can only endure and gnash our teeth, striving to build up our air power. The Japanese Air Force must deeply understand that there will be a day when they can strike and destroy enemy aircraft to avenge today's humiliation. The Asahi Shimbun stated that because the enemy cannot achieve its tactical goal of depleting Japanese air combat strength, it is making every effort to disrupt Japanese land and sea transportation lines, bombing military facilities, and bombing urban areas. In particular, the enemy believes that naval bombardment can shake public morale, so they appear on the sea at any time and any place in a guerrilla fashion. We must have adequate countermeasures for this and be prepared to prevent public morale from wavering. The Japanese Air Force has great expectations for dealing with the enemy's mobile units, so it is adopting a strategy of patience and restraint. Although the enemy is taking advantage of favorable weather conditions to run rampant, we are avoiding the futile loss of troops and quietly awaiting the opportunity to strike back at the enemy.

### P-51 Aircraft Attack Toyohashi and Other Areas

A 21st Central News Agency dispatch from Tokyo reports that approximately 100 enemy P-51 aircraft, on the 20th at noon, mainly targeted the Toyohashi and Okazaki areas, with a portion operating in the northern Nagoya area. For about an hour and a half, they retreated south from the Ise Bay area. Enemy aircraft strafed several locations with machine guns, causing very minor damage.

A 21st Central News Agency dispatch from Tokyo reports that the enemy mobile units that came to the Kanto region around the 10th of this month later turned north and attacked the Tohoku and Hokkaido regions on the 14th and 15th. After that, they returned to attack the southern part of the Tohoku region and the Kanto region. During this period, enemy warships approached the Japanese coast and bombarded Muroran, Kamaishi, and coastal cities in Ibaraki. The enemy aircraft that repeatedly attacked totaled approximately 4,800. Japanese ground fire shot down 164 enemy aircraft and damaged over 100. This time, the enemy's naval and air power was about 1,000, but 20% of it has already been consumed.

### Japanese Army Ministry Establishes New Land Transport Department

A 21st Central News Agency dispatch from Tokyo reports that the Japanese military, in order to fully prepare for the decisive battle on the homeland, previously transferred the authority over short-distance land transportation, managed by the Ministry of Munitions and the Ministry of Transportation, to the Army Ministry. Now, a new Land Transport Department has been established within the ministry, specializing in the affairs under the jurisdiction of the former Ministry of Transportation's Automobile Bureau. The Land Transport Department is divided into General Affairs, Administration, and Maintenance Sections. Major General Hajime Nakamura has been appointed as the department head. Personnel for each section will be selected and appointed from the Army, Navy, Ministry of Transportation, Ministry of Munitions, Ministry of Home Affairs, Ministry of Agriculture and Commerce, and Ministry of Health and Welfare, and will be individuals with rich transportation experience and proven abilities.

### Rescue Efforts for Downed American Pilots

A 21st Central News Agency dispatch from Lisbon reports that as the American air raids on the Japanese homeland intensify, the sacrifices are also increasing. However, the United States, being a country that highly values life, is making great efforts in rescuing downed pilots. According to reports from the Pacific enemy strategic air force authorities announced on the 19th that in the six months leading up to June of this year, the Mariana-based air rescue team has rescued over 600 downed aircrew from within the Japanese maritime zone. The majority were B-29 aircrew who had fallen into the sea. Thousands of B-29 crew members were forced to land at the Iwo Jima base. According to reports, 68% of these rescue operations were jointly undertaken by aircraft and transport ships. However, the work is extremely vast. On average, rescuing one person requires a search of 3,300 kilometers. The round-trip distance for rescue aircraft is actually 22,016,000 kilometers.

### Wei Daoming Issues Warning in the United States

Japanese War Strength Should Not Be Underestimated

A 21st Central News Agency dispatch from Lisbon reports, according to a Washington dispatch: Wei Daoming, the Chongqing ambassador to the United States, after meeting with acting Secretary of State Grew on the 19th, also met with a group of journalists, warning the world that we should not be optimistic about the future of the war, because American and British propaganda agencies are enthusiastically broadcasting "particularly favorable" news about the bombing of the Japanese homeland and naval bombardment, leading to a general sense of pride and complacency among the public. Therefore, in the future, the public must be made aware that Japan's war strength is still formidable, in order to correct the public's past perceptions.

### Mountbatten Returns to India from the Philippines

### Vietnamese Emperor Announces the Return of Three Cities

A 31st Central News Agency dispatch from Hanoi reports that the three cities of Hanoi, Haiphong, and Tourane, which the Vietnamese Empire has longed for for many years, were fully recovered on the 20th at noon, according to an announcement by the Vietnamese Emperor. At noon on the same day, Prime Minister Kim announced the recovery of the three cities at the Hanoi District Office, followed by the inaugural address of the first mayor, Dr. Zhang Wanglan. This adds another brilliant page to Annam's history. At the same time, inaugural ceremonies for the mayors of Haiphong and Tourane were also held locally.

### Song Ziwen's Speech at the Chongqing Political Council

The Government is About to be Reorganized

A 21st Central News Agency dispatch from Lisbon reports, according to a Reuters dispatch from Chongqing, Chongqing Executive Yuan President Song Ziwen stated at the National Political Council on the 20th that in order to plan for post-war reconstruction, the government will be immediately reorganized and, for the sake of developing industry and the economy, is working hard to negotiate mutual benefits with the United States. Regarding the Moscow talks, he stated that there were no definite cases yet. As for what Song meant by "immediate government reorganization," whether it was to establish a democratic coalition government in response to the demands of the left wing, or simply to readjust the Chongqing camp, people from all walks of life in Chongqing are still in the dark. In short, Song's statement was intended to appease the voices of those criticizing the Kuomintang.

### National Assembly Likely to be Postponed

A 21st Central News Agency dispatch from Lisbon reports, according to a United Press dispatch from Chongqing, on the 18th, 199 members of the Chongqing National Political Council were present, and 170 jointly passed a resolution requesting the government to seek the following policies before convening the National Assembly: 1. Chongqing must be unified. 2. Legal status should be granted to parties other than the Kuomintang. 3. Freedom of speech, publication, assembly, and association should be permitted. 4. Wartime organizations in local provinces and districts should be organized. When discussing the above requirements, although there was fierce opposition to setting the date for convening the National Assembly as November 12, there was no direct denial of the provisional date decided at the Kuomintang Sixth National Congress. As for the final decision on the convening date, it seems to have been left to the government's discretion, so the convening of the assembly is likely to be postponed.

### Yan'an Prepares to Convene People's Representative Conference

### The Surrender of German Forces on Crete: The Process

A Central News Agency dispatch reports, according to a TASS dispatch from Athens: A person recently arriving from Crete stated that when the German forces surrendered on the island, they first sank their heavy weapons and transport vehicles into the sea, retaining only their infantry weapons. A few days ago, a German soldier shot and killed a Greek man named Antroulakis. According to a proclamation by British commander Bladeston, stationed in Crete, as reported by various Athenian newspapers, Antroulakis was shot and killed by a German sentry in a German position. Bladeston also stated that the weapons abandoned and sunk by the German forces were all old. On July 18, more than 500 armed German soldiers passed through Piraeus. They were clearly coming from Crete, and their spirits were quite low.

### Strikes and Riots in Northern Italy

Carry Political Undertones

A 21st Central News Agency dispatch from Stockholm reports, according to a Reuters correspondent in Rome, politically motivated strikes and riots have been occurring frequently in the central region of northern Italy in recent weeks. The main reason for these actions is the local population's dissatisfaction with the measures implemented by the Allied occupation authorities. On Wednesday, in the Turin area, a group of demonstrators attacked the "Giornale" news agency and the "Fiat" automobile company, which was established during the fascist era. After extensively vandalizing both locations, they demonstrated in front of the United Nations military headquarters in Venice and the surrounding areas. On Thursday, there was a general strike in opposition to the Allied authorities' policies regarding issues of honor. The general strike in Trieste on Wednesday is said to have been backed by a coalition of the Italian Communist Party and Tito supporters.

### Belgian Left-Wing Newspaper Exposes King's Pro-German Tendencies

A Central News Agency dispatch reports, according to a TASS dispatch from Brussels: As Belgium is currently discussing the issue of King Leopold, the Belgian newspaper "Le Peuple" has published new materials regarding the King's relationship with the Hitler party. The newspaper, citing reliable sources, stated that the Belgian King decided to leave Belgium a few days before the Allied forces landed in France. Even before Belgium was about to be liberated, the King was still negotiating with others regarding this matter. The King adopted this decision out of fear that after the failure of Hitler's Germany, those who had previously supported Germany would suffer. The same motive prompted him to refuse to reside in Belgium or flee the country with the help of the Allies. The newspaper also claimed that the King made comparisons extremely unfavorable to the Allies when comparing the Allied forces with the situation under German occupation.

### If the Enemy and America Achieve Their Aggressive Ambitions, They Will Inevitably Land on the Chinese Mainland: Remarks by Squad Leader Shimada of the Reporting Team

Lieutenant Colonel Shimada of the Shanghai Japanese Army Reporting Team held a regular press conference yesterday morning (the 21st), during which he made the following remarks to reporters in this city regarding the issue of the enemy and the United States attempting to realize a landing operation on the Chinese mainland:

### The Problem of Landing on the Chinese Mainland

The issue of the American military attempting to carry out a landing operation on the mainland has been quite noteworthy recently. Chiang Kai-shek in Chongqing met with foreign reporters at the end of June. In his speech to the soldiers and civilians on the eighth anniversary of the "War of Resistance," and during the meeting with the National Political Council, he openly expressed three times that he did not welcome the American military landing on the Chinese mainland. Chen Cheng, also at the end of June meeting with foreign reporters, expressed the hope that American economic aid would be superior to the landing of the American military. However, the American side has not expressed anything to the Chongqing regime regarding this issue of landing on the Chinese mainland. I believe that the American military landing on the Chinese mainland has nothing to do with the strategy of attacking the Japanese homeland, and is the launch of another American attempt.

### A Glimpse of Recent American and Chongqing Public Opinion

Since General Wedemeyer took over as commander, he established the U.S. Military Headquarters in the China Theater at the end of June, and the Chongqing Military Affairs Department also participated in it. Presumably, as an American military organ, it intends to prepare to connect with the Chongqing intelligence organs after seizing the Japanese-occupied areas. In order to implement the political schemes made to spy on various cities, it has convened specialists from four important coastal cities in eastern China to discuss various tasks the American military will carry out during landing and occupation. Recently, American and Chongqing public opinion has expressed the deep hope that the American and Chongqing armies will shake hands on the Chinese coast. On the 12th of this month, the Chongqing radio broadcast claimed: If the southeast coast is occupied, a maritime transportation line with the American and British armies can be established immediately, and the necessary supplies can also be supplied immediately. The daily transportation volume gained will be superior to the monthly transportation volume of the Stilwell Road.

### Reasons for the American Military's Attempt to Land

If the American military cannot land on the Chinese mainland, then the political ambition of America to extend its clutches to East Asia will completely come to naught. There are three reasons: The so-called general counteroffensive of the Chongqing army will only become a reality with the coastal supply assistance of the United States due to the insufficient supplies of the Stilwell Road, which is clearly understood by the Chongqing side as well. The British, who are responsible for half of the supply routes in India and Burma, have made no progress at all, so the Chongqing side is requesting marine supply routes from the United States, which clearly proves that the American military landing on the Chinese mainland will inevitably become a reality. At the same time, the United States is attempting to completely control the China issue. The transfers of Stilwell, Chennault, etc., were all caused by frictions due to various operational problems and the pressure exerted by the American military and military organs on American policy towards China.

### The Enemy Seeks to Seize Various Rights and Interests

In order to gain a voice in China and East Asia, and to aim for a more authoritative position than the Chongqing regime, the United States claims that the coastal areas should be seized, not by the Chongqing army, but by the American military. It also requests that the American military be stationed for a considerable period of time and that American military organs be allowed to operate. The lowest level of American ambition is to seek the interests that Britain held in China before the war. The change in the positions of Britain and the United States gives Britain the opportunity to concede its equal and superior position in China. China is the only industrial market for the United States after the war. At the time when the military industry is transforming into a civilian industry, the anxious United States, relying on the Lend-Lease Act, forces the Chongqing side to bear the obligation of importing American goods into China after the war, and to implement free trade in the Chinese market. Therefore, the more the United States requires aid, Lend-Lease materials, etc. from the Chongqing side, the more willing it is to help. Under this scheme, the American military will inevitably land and seize the coasts of China. As for the cost of China's reconstruction after the war, it requires 3.5 billion U.S. dollars. In the past, the Chongqing side mostly relied on foreign loans, so the United States, seeing that the Chongqing side urgently needs Lend-Lease materials and post-war reconstruction, uses tricks and schemes in an attempt to acquire rights and interests in China. In short, the United States absolutely must land on the Chinese mainland. Apart from the military necessity, it also holds political and economic ambitions towards the Chongqing side, which is worthy of attention.

### Japanese Forces Crossing the Kitun River Receive Commendation; Morale Soars, Continuing to Fight Bravely

A 21st Central News Agency dispatch from a forward base in the Burmese theater reports that the Japanese forces in Burma forcibly crossed the Kitun River during heavy rains. Since the start of the operation, they have killed or wounded more than 2,000 enemy soldiers, achieving remarkable results that have terrified the enemy. On the 18th, they were honored to receive a commendation from the Japanese Emperor for their bravery, which they accepted with gratitude. All the soldiers are even more determined to advance and serve the country, their morale is even higher, and they continue to fight bravely.

Weekly Commentary

### A Re-understanding of the Decisive Battle with Japan

— Bai Song

The entire Japanese nation has risen up valiantly at this critical juncture of a decisive battle on their homeland. Japan's special attack units are not limited to officers and soldiers; the spirit of special attacks surges in the hearts of all one hundred million citizens. This so-called spirit of special attacks is not only manifested on the battlefield but also in increased military production, increased food production, and all other projects to defend the homeland. Furthermore, in present-day Japan, there is no distinction between the front lines and the rear, nor between soldiers and civilians. The rear is the front line, and all citizens are soldiers. The entire country has formed an iron-clad fortress.

In analyzing the current system within Japan, the first thing that must be mentioned is the implementation of the "Volunteer Military Service Law." At the 87th Extraordinary Session of the Diet, the Japanese government proposed the "Volunteer Military Service Law," which was approved with the Diet's consent. On June 22nd, the enforcement ordinance, enforcement rules, and the national volunteer unit system were promulgated and implemented immediately. This decree caused great excitement among the people of Japan. No matter where they were or what their position, they were directly connected to the war effort and took on the glorious mission of defending the country. Minister of War Anami once explained the significance of the decisive battle on the homeland in a radio broadcast: "The future battlefield is the sacred homeland where the ancestral spirits reside, not isolated islands with difficult supplies and useless troop strength as before. The enemy, the United States and Britain, comes across the ocean, which contains great difficulties and suffering. Our supplies of weapons, ammunition, etc., are assured. Moreover, we have the support of one hundred million comrades who will step over the corpses of their comrades, push the enemy back, and never yield. In the air, on the water, or on the ground, in all prepared combat fronts, we have millions of elite troops eager to fight. This time, with the support and backing of all the citizens, we can launch continuous attacks." This statement precisely describes the source of Japan's strength in the decisive battle on the homeland and points out the legislative spirit of the National Volunteer Military Service Law.

The second point we can particularly highlight here is the development status of Japan's military supply factories. Although enemy aircraft have destroyed many buildings in Japan and damaged parts of several major cities, the source of war power during the decisive battle period is not in the big cities but in the military supply factories scattered everywhere. Currently, Japan has many large-scale aircraft factories continuing to work underground, and there are factories where they can't even hear the air raid sirens, allowing them to work diligently day and night. Even if the factories are not underground, they are dispersed in the high mountains, dense forests, and countryside. Not only is it difficult for enemy planes to find their targets, but even the Japanese people each work hard at their own tasks, not interacting or inquiring about others' work, even if they hear the sounds of machinery. Some factories, although not underground and not in remote areas, have extremely clever camouflage to avoid enemy reconnaissance, or they have extremely solid bulletproof and fireproof equipment to reduce the effectiveness of enemy bombing. Therefore, it can be said that the more Japan's major cities are destroyed, the more the people's anti-enemy spirit is aroused, and the more they work hard at military production. Japan's military production has not only not weakened due to enemy bombing but has even shown a tendency to increase as a result.

Third, we can not only sympathize with the citizens of Japan's major cities who have been affected by the disasters but also find aspects worthy of our respect. After their homes were bombed, those who evacuated to the countryside either participated in military production or engaged in farming to supplement the insufficient rural labor force. Originally, they were city dwellers who primarily engaged in consumption, but now they have all become vital forces in the production camp. They are not only not passive or pessimistic but have also abandoned all personal concerns and devoted themselves wholeheartedly to the cause of serving the country. Moreover, even those who have lived in the cities for a long time are unwilling to leave even after their houses have been bombed. Instead, they engage in reclamation work in the bombed-out ruins, set up tents, or build simple huts to settle down and continue to fulfill their protection responsibilities as long-time residents of the cities. This situation fully demonstrates the tenacious life force of the Japanese nation. This spirit of enduring hardship and not yielding is truly a symbol of Japan's vigorous fighting spirit.

Fourth, we must also pay attention to the power of Japanese young students. Since the implementation of the "Wartime Education Ordinance," Japanese teachers and students have united as one. Their classrooms are factories and farms, and their work is to increase military production and food production. Life, education, and serving the country are integrated into one. Whether in the countryside or in factories, the participation of these many young students has created a completely new atmosphere. The young students in the rear are fighting just as hard as the special attack units on the front lines. This is the true embodiment of the education of "unity of knowledge and action" and the highest peak of fully demonstrating the essence of "development, accumulation, education, and training."

Yoshida Shōin, a visionary of the Meiji Restoration, once said: "The rise of the barbarians is said to be a major national event, but it is not a cause for deep concern. What is deeply concerning is the dishonesty of the people's hearts. Once the people's hearts are honest, they will defend the country even at the cost of a hundred deaths." Japan's current system for the decisive battle is indeed becoming more and more solid because the whole nation is moving in the right direction. This is also the reason why the enemy, the United States, dared not rashly launch a landing operation on the homeland after the Battle of Okinawa. We must have a deep understanding of Japan, which is determined to fight the decisive battle, so that we can strengthen our beliefs. Our understanding of Japan's determination to fight the decisive battle cannot be based on mere speculation or rumors. We must understand Japan's decisive battle power from its true state.

### Analysis of the New Policies in Zhejiang Province

— Special Correspondent Tang Yi of this Newspaper

Observing the superficial aspects of the new policies in Zhejiang Province, it seems that the efforts of the Zhejiang authorities are focused on addressing urgent problems, such as curbing corruption and extortion and stabilizing prices. During this trip to Zhejiang, in addition to inquiring about the opinions of those in power, I also made contact with people from all walks of life to study the Zhejiang Provincial Government's policies and steps for governing Zhejiang. My feeling is this: Zhejiang Province's current difficulties lie in the shortage of materials, soaring prices, the hardship of the people's livelihood, rampant bandits, and financial difficulties. In short, the difficulty is economic. However, Ding Mocun's governance of Zhejiang starts from military affairs, uses politics as a means, and relies on the economy and the people's livelihood.

### Governing Principles of Zhejiang

Examining the current situation, three points can be identified: 1. The flow of goods is not smooth, transportation is blocked, and the security of some transportation lines cannot be established. 2. In areas far from the city and main transportation lines, farmers are abused by various troops. Those who cannot withstand extortion abandon their fields and move elsewhere, while the poor lack the capital for cultivation. Gardens are abandoned, and production is reduced. 3. Wuxing in the Taihu Basin is a major rice-producing area, controlled by the New Fourth Army, which implements the so-called grain exchange policy. Therefore, it seems that the new Zhejiang authorities want to first "drive away" the New Fourth Army from the border area and ensure that the rice-producing area is within their own blockade. The second step is to eliminate bandits within the territory, while repairing highways and opening waterways to facilitate transportation and establish political prestige. The third step is to implement light tax collection on farmland to use the proceeds to improve the salaries of military police teams and civil servants so that they no longer harass the people. This conjecture is not without basis. We can imagine this from the following facts.

### Establishing Security

Zhejiang Province's security is among the worst in the southeastern provinces. At the beginning of this year, the official intelligence revealed that many New Fourth Army soldiers had infiltrated Zhejiang from Jiangbei, Jiangnan, and Huainan, constantly clashing with Chongqing troops to seize territory. After Ding took charge of Zhejiang, he believed that without establishing security, any other issue was out of the question. Therefore, he launched a campaign by the defense forces to carry out a sweeping operation. With the full assistance of the Allied forces, great achievements were made in the first half of June. Ding's plan seems to be centered on Hangzhou. The first step is to open the line between Wuxing and Deqing, which has already been completed. The next step is to open the line from Hangzhou to Fuyang, which will also soon be achieved. Then, they will proceed to secure Changxing, Wukang, Lin'an, and the area east of Fuyang to consolidate the defense of the western Zhejiang border. Given the strength of the Zhejiang Provincial Army, this plan should not be difficult to complete. It is said that the New Fourth Army, entrenched in the Changxing, Wuxing, and Wukang areas, is threatened by Chongqing troops to the west and attacked by the National Army and Allied forces to the east. With the boundless Taihu Lake to the north, they have no choice but to retreat south into Tianmu Mountain. Tianmu Mountain is located at the intersection of Zhejiang and Anhui, making combat quite difficult, so future developments are highly noteworthy.

### Restoring Transportation

Following the military action, the second step is to restore transportation. For example, between Hangzhou and Wuxing, in addition to the waterway that has already been restored, the highway is undergoing preliminary repairs under the joint efforts of the local troops and the respective county governments, and bridges are also being renovated. In the future, when the military action on the Hangzhou-Fuyang highway is completed, road repair work will also begin. To meet the needs, the Zhejiang Provincial Government has established a Highway Bureau under the Provincial Government, with Governor Ding concurrently serving as the Bureau Chief, which shows the importance attached to it. In addition to the above two roads, the Hangzhou-Tongxiang highway and the Tongxiang-Shanghai highway have also been started, and some projects are being tendered for bidding. When the reporter spoke with Governor Ding, Governor Ding said: "Although it will cost a lot, we have decided to do it first and talk later."

### Increasing Food Production

In the past, Zhejiang Province's food supply was insufficient to meet its own needs. Moreover, because the food supply in the rice-producing areas of Changxing and Wuxing was blockaded, Zhejiang's food supply was very strained, and grain prices once soared to one million, higher than Shanghai. Although it has now returned to normal due to the National Government's opening of rice sales, the supply and demand cannot be matched before the new rice is harvested. The provincial government is encouraging people to plant coarse grains, which has already had some effect. In the future, if security in the production areas can be ensured, allowing farmers to return to their fields and cultivate the land, the serious food panic that has been occurring can be alleviated, and this year's land tax collection can be successfully implemented. With adequate supplies for the military and civil servants, the practice of corruption and extortion will not be difficult to eradicate.

### Ding's Style

The analysis of the new policies in Zhejiang Province generally follows the above path. Now, let us end these few travel communications with a dialogue. The person being talked to is a provincial government guard who, according to him, came during Governor Wang's era. He has seen the Provincial Government change many masters. The weather in Hangzhou is exceptionally hot, and my clothes are soaked with sweat. I can't help but exclaim, "It's so hot!" The guard blurted out, "I'm alright." Then, looking at himself wearing only a sweaty undershirt, he explained embarrassedly:

"This Governor is strange. He doesn't care about these things. He only cares about getting things done. It doesn't matter if you wear an undershirt. The clerks come to the office at eight in the morning and leave at one in the afternoon. We have to accompany the Governor and senior officials and drip with sweat. We come early every morning, eat our meals here, and wait until the Governor returns to the cloud at seven or eight in the evening before we can leave. Even on Sundays, he still holds what-you-call discussion meetings that last half the day, and we can't go back until the afternoon."

The guard said this, hoping to gain the sympathy of a stranger. However, he did not. He was thinking of someone else, a person with a pale face.

### Potsdam Conference Enters Second Stage Churchill and Stalin Hold Secret Talks

Central News Agency, Stockholm, July 21st. According to a dispatch from Mr. Marding, a special correspondent for Reuters in Stockholm: It seems that Truman, Churchill, and Stalin have reached their major goals in the Potsdam talks. After the banquet on Wednesday, Churchill and Stalin held a secret meeting that lasted about three hours. The talks have now entered the second stage.

### Disagreements Still Exist Regarding the Three-Power Rule of Germany

Central News Agency, Stockholm, July 21st. According to a report by Reuters correspondent Ponte in London: When the Three-Power Conference issues a large number of detailed plans on how to manage post-war Germany, attention should be paid to the current disagreements among the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union. These disagreements are not about the principle of how to make the Germans govern Germany under the control of the Allied authorities, but about the selection of German personnel and German political parties. Currently, the governments of several German provinces manage the three major regions with the same authority, and the territory of the entire Germany will be estimated according to the area of these three regions. The difference between the authorities managing the British and American regions and the authorities managing the Soviet region does not lie in the authority of the managing authorities, but in the organization of the parties. In western Germany, no Communist Party members can exceed the position and power of local officials. In Bavaria and the Southern Rhineland, the major positions are occupied by members of the right-wing Catholic political parties. In Hamburg and Hanover, non-partisan businessmen and right-wing civilians have the majority of power. Social Democratic Party leaders in the entire Hesse and the entire Central Rhineland, as well as in Westphalia and Oldenburg, hold the ruling power under the leadership of the right-wing Catholic political parties and radical parties. In the management government of the eastern region, the governing body includes four to six people, including Communist Party members, Social Democratic Party members, and middle-class personnel. In the management governments of eastern Germany, the governing officials are nominally representatives sent by the parties in the west, but in reality, their parties themselves are openly rejected. In the western military government, officials reject general anti-Nazi committees and public welfare organizations under the pretext of "administrative convenience," while the so-called "chambers of commerce" are actually neutral political party organizations composed of the three major parties: Social Democrats, Communists, and Catholics. However, the Soviet Union allows various German anti-fascist parties to operate freely and even needs to oversee or lead their actions from time to time. In short, the hegemonic parties of the management authorities throughout Germany cannot achieve consistency.

### Soviet Union Appoints Heads of Two German Provinces

Central News Agency News According to a TASS dispatch from Berlin, the Soviet military government in Germany, the guidance committee of the state of Saxony and the state of Thuringia, consulted with the local autonomous governments for several days and submitted candidate lists for the heads and deputy heads of the administrative organizations of each province to the head of the Soviet military government. After consultation and study by Marshal Zhukov, Commander-in-Chief of the Soviet occupation forces in Germany and head of the Soviet military government, he immediately approved the recommendations. He announced the appointment of Dr. Herbener, a doctor of economics, as the chairman of the administrative organization of the state of Saxony (before 1933, he worked in the administrative organs and was a member of the Democratic Party), and Ziefan as the vice chairman (he was a mason and a member of the Communist Party). The administrative organization of the state of Saxony is located in the city of Halle and has begun work. Dr. Burfel, a doctor of law, was appointed as the chairman of the administrative organization of the state of Thuringia (before 1933, he worked in the prosecutor's office and was a member of the Civil Life Party), and Buss was appointed as the vice chairman (before 1933, he was a lawyer and a member of the German Social Democratic Party). The administrative organization of the state of Thuringia is located in the city of Weimar and has also begun work.

### Black Market Rampant in Berlin

Central News Agency, Stockholm, July 21st. According to a Reuters dispatch from Berlin: The four Allied military commanders stationed in Berlin have decided to take the same steps to strictly ban the black market transactions that are becoming increasingly rampant. At the same time, the local German police will also strive to eliminate the black market under the guidance of the Allied military authorities. All circles expect that the Allied military authorities will punish all those who specialize in illegal transportation of goods, regardless of whether they are military personnel from the Allied side or German civilians. However, the problem is not so simple. The main point is that there is a shortage of supplies in Berlin or in the entire Germany. In fact, this phenomenon of rampant black markets exists in all the so-called "liberated countries."

### Another Case of Government Employees Neglecting Duties Handed Over to Special Court Security Police Corps Commander and Six Others

The Municipal Police Bureau has another two cases of government personnel being corrupt, neglecting their duties, confusing the military, undermining the army's intentions, and committing embezzlement and neglect of duty, involving a total of seven criminals. After verification by the Criminal Investigation Section of the Third Division, it was submitted to the Municipal Government for approval by Chairman Chen, and yesterday (21st), Wu Xiangfu of the section escorted the criminals to the Shanghai Branch of the Special Court for trial. Details of the cases are described below:

### Corruption, Neglect of Duty, Confusing the Military

The facts of former Security Police Corps Commander Qu Jiuzhi committing neglect of duty are: (A) Embezzlement of funds, allegedly signing and receiving funds on behalf of others and failing to distribute them. Encroachment on desertion pay, more than 100,000 yuan of desertion pay in March of this year, allegedly distributed to officers of all levels of the Corps Headquarters except for less than 40,000 yuan that he kept for his own miscellaneous expenses. Reducing rice rations, allegedly deducting four catties from each load of rice when distributing rice rations to each team, in addition to the shortage of each stone of rice, about 70-80 per period, distributed to all officers of the Corps Headquarters. (B) Confusing the military and undermining the army's intentions have been verified and are subject to Article 12 of the Wartime Criminal Special Law and Article 2 and Article 7, Paragraph 2 of the Regulations on Punishing Government Employees for Corruption.

### Finance Bureau Employees Commit Neglect of Duty

Wang Rongsheng, Chen Ziyu, and Hu Min, adjustment and subsidy staff of the Yingye Tax Madang Road District Collection Office of the Finance Bureau, have the case of Weng, manager of the Gongxing Company, Zhang Mingkai, manager of the Yuxiang Company, and Manager Ze Song of the Zhunde Company, paying bribes to the three offenders. After examination and verification by the Investigation Section, it was determined that the three civil servants violated Article 1, Paragraph 2 of the Regulations on Punishing Government Employees for Corruption, and the remaining three defendants violated Article 122, Paragraph 3 of the Criminal Law.

### Pastry, Steamed Bun, and Fried Dough Stick Industry Exempt from Business Tax

Although members of the local pastry, steamed bun, and fried dough stick industry association primarily engage in producing foods such as large pastries, fried dough sticks, and steamed buns, most lack dedicated storefronts. Furthermore, due to the limited scope of their operations, they generally do not maintain registers to record business volume. Thus, while they may appear to be shops, they are in reality just households. In light of this situation, the industry association, based on the actual circumstances, submitted a request to the Municipal Government's Finance Bureau, which then forwarded it to the Municipal Government, seeking exemption from business tax for the large pastry, fried dough stick, and steamed bun industry to alleviate business hardship. This request has now been approved. Cash and cashier's checks are being handled separately for deposit and payment, which major banks and financial institutions have already implemented.

### Cash and Cashier's Checks Handled Separately for Deposit and Payment; Major Banks and Financial Institutions Already Implemented

Due to the inability of local banks and financial institutions to widely supply cash, various institutions have issued parallel-line, immediately payable cashier's checks to circulate in the market, serving the same function as cash. However, when purchasing goods, many merchants have refused to accept them, leading to a worsening trend of profiteering and discounting by market speculators. Major banks and financial institutions with a long history, in order to facilitate customers and make every effort to supply cash, have, in addition to automatically increasing the weekly cash withdrawal ratio for depositors from 20% to 30%, also recently separated the cash and cashier's check deposit amounts for depositors. For those who deposit cash, when making payments, they are paid in full with cash. For those who deposit cashier's checks, they are still paid cash according to the weekly cash payment ratio. It is reported that this measure greatly helps the authorities reduce the practice of discounting. It is regrettable that the Bank and Financial Institution Association has not yet notified its members to implement this measure uniformly. Some stubbornly insist that bank cashier's checks are equivalent to cash, and that any losses from discounting are purely self-inflicted. This view seems to disregard the facts. If all banks and financial institutions could relax cash withdrawals for depositors, at least the discounting trend could be somewhat mitigated.

### Hongkou Swimming Pool Grand Opening Yesterday; Director Yuan of the Health Bureau Presided Over the Ceremony

The Hongkou Swimming Pool, managed by the Municipal Health Bureau, held a grand opening ceremony yesterday (the 21st) at 4:00 PM. Attendees included Deputy Secretary-General Ze Wu representing Mayor Zhou, Lu Runzhi, Director of the Central Health Administration, and heads of various municipal agencies, Xu Jidun, Liu Xingchen, Yan Fuqing, Tatsui Senjin, Shoji Kita, and several hundred others. The ceremony was presided over by Yuan Jufan, Director of the Health Bureau, with Ms. Bai Guang cutting the ribbon. There were also swimming performances, creating a lively atmosphere.

### Director Yuan's Opening Remarks

Today, we are holding the opening ceremony for the 34th summer season of the municipal swimming pool. I am honored to have Secretary-General Hu representing the Mayor, as well as heads of various bureaus and offices, and all the distinguished guests present. Swimming is a form of exercise that is extremely beneficial for strengthening the body and is especially suitable during the summer season. While there are swimming pools established by organizations and private individuals in the city, they have all been closed. Currently, only this municipal pool remains, which is insufficient to meet the needs of all the citizens of the city. If conditions permit in the future and other requirements are met, we will strive to add more facilities and vigorously promote swimming so that the public deeply understands the benefits of swimming as exercise and actively engages in practice. It is our hope that the health of all the citizens will improve daily.

### Mayor's Representative Delivers Remarks

Deputy Secretary-General Ze Wu delivered remarks on behalf of Mayor Zhou, stating in brief: The Municipal Government believes that promoting the health of citizens and advocating for physical education is of great significance, and the opening of the only Hongkou swimming pool in the city is of extreme importance.

At a time when materials are extremely scarce and the situation is very tense, the opening of this swimming pool is not merely a superficial display of peace and prosperity, but is actually intended to promote the health of citizens and further accomplish the mission of the Greater East Asia War. At the same time, precisely because of the extreme scarcity of materials, we have used our best efforts and received assistance and cooperation from all sides to enable the swimming pool to open as scheduled. Therefore, we hope that all citizens and young men and women who love sports will make use of it, exercise their bodies, and not let this great opportunity pass by lightly, and not fail the Mayor and the health authorities in their efforts to promote physical education.

### Results of the Performance Finals

### Make Utmost Efforts to Relieve Air Raid Victims

Kind-hearted people from all walks of life sympathize with air raid victims, and donations for relief funds have been continuously pouring in. Even during air raid alarm periods yesterday, people enthusiastically sent donations to this office, demonstrating that the thought of doing good is deeply rooted in people's hearts. This spirit of human mutual aid is truly exciting. However, considering that air raids may become more frequent in the future, the need to actively promote relief work is urgent. Powerful individuals from all walks of life should make their utmost efforts to contribute generously to provide assistance and achieve significant results. The following are excerpts from letters received:

A letter from Shanghai Hefeng Products Company states: "Our city has suffered terrible damage. How can we, as colleagues, stand idly by in the spirit of human mutual aid? Therefore, we have collected a total of 2,150,000 yuan in group funds, including 1,000,000 yuan from our company, 500,000 yuan from Chengfu Company, and 250,000 yuan each from Yixinghang, Jingcheng Factory, Yongqinghang, and Hemaohang, to be donated to relief agencies."

A letter from the Tongyi Enterprise Co., Ltd. states: "Our city has suffered bombing, and we, the colleagues of our company, cannot bear to sit idly by. Therefore, we are contributing 1,000,000 yuan to assist our fellow compatriots who have been bombed, as a small token of our feelings. Although it is a drop in the bucket, we hope to inspire sympathy from all sectors of society and encourage generous contributions."

A letter from Chen Chengji states: "Our city has suffered bombing this time, and the disaster is terrible, with many people displaced and homeless, which is unbearable to witness. I cannot bear to stand idly by, so I am contributing 1,000,000 yuan for relief efforts, requesting that it be distributed as 500,000 yuan each to the Air Raid Relief Fund and the Pushan Hall, a small contribution to express my feelings."

### Various Sectors Actively Provide Disaster Relief

The Yanglu Central Church of the Taoist Church, due to the terrible air disaster in the Hudong area, with many displaced victims, dispatched personnel on the 20th to distribute self-made pastries in the disaster area and plans to provide congee in the area.

Businessmen and residents of the disaster-stricken area in Hudong, Wang Boyuan, [Blank] Wang Hou, etc., jointly formed a temporary relief office with the Central Church of Taoist Church, and it has now been decided to implement relief work starting today. Relief procedures are divided into: registration, medical treatment of injuries, evacuation, small loans, and fundraising. The office is temporarily located in the China Hospital at Tilan Bridge. Individuals from all walks of life who wish to donate relief funds or goods can directly send them to the Central Church of Taoist Church on Tongfu Road.

The temporary relief committee of Jimin Hospital has received pledges of 240 million yuan, and yesterday began providing free medical treatment to citizens affected by air raids at the hospital at the end of North Xizang Road. In addition to donations, various sectors have also responded with medicine. We hope for a continuous stream of donations.
