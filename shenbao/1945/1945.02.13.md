### Frugal Living During the Spring Festival

Today is the first day of the Spring Festival. It is a custom for people to take holidays and feast, so the consumption and extravagance during the Spring Festival period are indeed considerable. We need not mention the past. However, at present, because the times and environment are different, we must not be bound by convention and live a life that violates the times. We are currently in a time of war that determines the fate of the nation, especially in the tense decisive battle stage. The soldiers at the front are shedding blood for our entire East Asian nation. If we in the rear can only imagine this for a moment, how can we indulge in extravagance and wanton revelry!

Therefore, we should spend the holiday quietly during the Spring Festival and take this opportunity to review everything in the past and decide on the direction for the future. What is most undesirable is to be bound by customs, to gamble and drink wildly, and to engage in wasteful spending. Moreover, as we have repeatedly said, the environment in Shanghai is harboring worrying crises. All those residing in Shanghai have the necessity to be vigilant and cooperate to eliminate the crisis. Then, how can we have the mood to lead a life of consumption and extravagance? At the same time, it is clear that in the future environment, the salaried class will inevitably suffer more from high prices, and the industrial and commercial sectors will inevitably encounter waves of depression and recession. To meet this future environment, the only way is for everyone to be frugal, to contribute their efforts, and to strive for a favorable war situation and to transform the entire environment. If we understand this point, we will not live a life that violates the times.

Finally, let us take a step back. Before the Spring Festival, the circulation of cash in this city was extremely scarce. Everyone thought that cash was precious, so we cannot just spend it extravagantly. We hope that all citizens of Shanghai, especially the more affluent classes, will spend this Spring Festival in a spirit of frugality.
