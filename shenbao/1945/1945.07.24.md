### Naval Gun Battle off the Southern Coast of the Bōsō Peninsula, Japan; Father Island and the Chishima Islands Shelled

Tokyo, 23rd (Central News Agency dispatch) – Enemy naval vessels are becoming increasingly active in the waters near Japan. On the afternoon of the 22nd, at around 11:00 PM, approximately eight enemy vessels resembling destroyers attacked a Japanese transport convoy sailing in the waters south of the Bōsō Peninsula, resulting in a twenty-minute gun battle with Japanese escort vessels. At around midnight on the 23rd, Japanese patrol boats discovered three enemy submarines near Father Island and attacked them. The enemy then shelled Father Island for half an hour at around 3:00 AM that morning. In northern waters, at a little after 7:00 AM on the 22nd, seven enemy vessels of unknown type shelled Horomushiro Island and Suribachi Mountain in the Chishima Islands (Kuril Islands). Additionally, a Japanese patrol vessel attacked an enemy vessel off the southern coast of Jeju Island in South Korea.

Tokyo, 23rd (Central News Agency dispatch) – At approximately 11:50 PM on the 22nd, Japanese naval vessels escorting transport ships discovered eight enemy destroyers off the southern tip of the Bōsō Peninsula. They immediately attacked, engaging in battle for about twenty minutes and repelling the enemy. One Japanese transport ship suffered minor damage.

Tokyo, 23rd (Central News Agency dispatch) – Enemy fleets continue to operate actively in the waters near Japan. At midnight on the 22nd, approximately eight enemy vessels resembling destroyers were again discovered off the Bōsō Peninsula, engaging in combat with Japanese escort vessels protecting a Japanese transport convoy. This is likely due to the increasingly intense attacks on the Japanese mainland by enemy aircraft from bases in Okinawa, the Mariana Islands, and Iwo Jima. The enemy’s persistent activity is intended to reduce Japan’s air power, disrupt military production, and cut off supply lines. Moreover, it has propaganda purposes, aiming to show the world that the U.S. fleet is operating near Japan, thus creating a propaganda effect; secondly, to give the Japanese people the impression that an invasion of the mainland is imminent; thirdly, to alienate the Japanese military and civilians; and fourthly, to lure out the Japanese fleet. Despite these aims, they will not achieve any substantial effect. Japan’s air power is currently waiting for the opportunity to destroy the enemy. Judging from the ferocity of Japanese special attack aircraft during the Battle of Okinawa, the enemy’s vessels are expected to suffer severe attrition and bloodshed.

### Japanese Air Force Vigorously Attacks Okinawa Bases and Ships; Eighty-Two Enemy Aircraft Shot Down

Tokyo, 23rd (Central News Agency dispatch) – The enemy’s mobile task force, which has been active in the waters near Japan since mid-July, has since turned south, but is feared to still be lurking in the waters near Japan. The enemy is actively preparing air bases in the Mariana Islands, Iwo Jima, and Okinawa. At the same time, B-29, B-24, P-51, and P-38 aircraft are repeatedly attacking the Japanese mainland. Enemy air offensives will intensify in the future. The enemy mobile task force came to the Kanto region for the last ten days, then went north and attacked the Tohoku and Hokkaido regions on the 14th and 15th. Then it returned south to attack the southern Tohoku and Kanto regions again on the 17th and 18th. During this time, the enemy approached the Japanese coast with a portion of its battleships, shelling Muroe, Kamaishi, and coastal areas of Ibaraki Prefecture. It dispatched a total of 4,800 carrier-based aircraft to various locations in Japan. Japanese forces only managed to shoot down 164 and damage over 100 from ground fire alone. Based on the number of aircraft dispatched, it is estimated that the Japanese military shot down or destroyed 20% of the enemy carrier-based aircraft. Additionally, enemy air forces in the Mariana Islands are coordinating with the mobile task force, sending B-29 aircraft to attack small and medium-sized cities in Japan. The P-51 aircraft from Iwo Jima are intensively attacking Japanese air bases in the Kanto and Tokai regions, as well as Japanese transportation infrastructure. Furthermore, enemy forces in Okinawa are working hard to construct bases for large aircraft, and frequently dispatch fighter-bomber formations to the Kyushu region, Zhoushan Island, and the Shanghai region for tactical attacks. Japanese air units have recently launched fierce attacks day and night against the island's bases and enemy ships in the nearby sea. As of the 19th, it has been confirmed that 14 B-29s have been shot down and 60 destroyed, while 7 P-57s have been shot down and 1 destroyed.

### Takamatsu and Utsunomiya Air Raided Yesterday Morning

Naval Mines Laid in Korean Waters

Osaka, 23rd (Central News Agency dispatch) – Approximately sixty enemy B-29 aircraft attacked the vicinity of Takamatsu and Utsunomiya from 11:30 PM on the 22nd until around 1:00 AM on the 23rd. A group dropped naval mines in the Kanmon Straits. Another group of about seven B-29s operated over the Sea of Japan for four hours, passing through Okayama's center at 8:30 PM on the 22nd.

Tokyo, 23rd (Central News Agency dispatch) – Six enemy B-29 aircraft entered the Bungo Channel from 12:30 AM on the 23rd for about three hours, passed through Shimonoseki to Busan, and dropped naval mines. Another group of seven B-29s entered from Kochi to Matsue, and dropped naval mines in Najin (North Korea) for about twenty minutes, starting at 12:00 AM on the 23rd.

### Japan's Wartime Food Supplies Sufficient

Lisbon, 23rd (Central News Agency dispatch) – The Japanese government authorities, in preparation for the decisive battle on the mainland, have established a self-sufficient food system and are vigorously promoting Japan's self-sufficiency in war materials. After receiving this news, the enemy became more concerned about Japan's war will and fighting power. An editorial in the Washington Star on the 20th claimed that it was a complete fallacy that the Japanese people would soon suffer from starvation. Leaving aside past realities, current food preparations are quite ample, and long-term rationing standards are unlikely to change. According to figures released by the Japanese authorities, Japan can supply 70% of its own wartime food needs. Therefore, the future of Japan's food problem depends entirely on agricultural labor and the functioning of transportation.

### U.S. Forces in the Pacific Implement New Training

Lisbon, 23rd (Central News Agency dispatch) – According to a London dispatch, the U.S. Army Headquarters announced on the 20th that it would implement a wide range of new military education for army personnel recently transferred from the European Theater to the Pacific Theater. The training stipulates forty-four hours per week of general military training. In addition to the tactics, weapons, uniforms, and identification marks used by the Japanese military, the curriculum includes methods of using various military weapons used by the U.S. military in the Pacific and methods for preventing infectious diseases.

### Damaged U.S. Cruiser Towed to Seattle for Repairs

Central News Agency – According to a Seattle broadcast, the U.S. Thirteenth Naval District officially announced that the cruiser USS Pittsburgh, which was damaged in a typhoon east-southeast of the Ryukyu Islands last month, losing its bow, has been towed to a shipyard near Seattle for repairs.

### High Morale of the Japanese People; Enemy's Strategic Offensive Fails; Military Commentator Analyzes the International Situation

A Shanghai military commentator made a detailed analysis of the international political situation and the strengths and weaknesses of Japanese soldiers compared to European and American soldiers yesterday (the 23rd). The details are as follows:

### Contents of the Three-Headed Conference Discussion

Regarding whether the British, American, and Soviet three-headed conference has made new proposals on military strategy regarding Japan, it is certain that there has been some discussion of the Pacific war situation at this conference, but it has not been made public. At present, the discussion focuses on European issues, with the British, Americans, and Soviets expressing various opinions on the division of national borders and the handling of the German problem among smaller countries. It is only after reaching a consensus that it will be possible to discuss the Pacific problem. Therefore, it is not yet time for a full-scale discussion of the Pacific question. According to a Potsdam telegram on the 21st, the issue of reparations is currently being discussed. The three great powers are basing themselves on the principles agreed upon by the Moscow Reparations Committee. The Soviet Union is proposing that, according to the Yalta Conference, it should receive 56% of the reparations, while the United States and Britain should split the remaining 44% equally. The issue of German reparations after the First World War not only had a great impact on Germany itself but also on its socio-economic structure for ten years. Therefore, even if the British, Americans, and Soviets reach an agreement this time, the consequences will be far-reaching. The Potsdam dispatch also stated that the three-headed conference also raised the issue of the Balkans, including Poland, Austria, Trieste, Turkey, and other Near Eastern countries. Over the past two centuries, Paris has become a pain in the neck of European politics, causing various waves. Although the discussions on European issues will be completed in turn, it will not be difficult to reach a resolution in the final discussion. However, the future of the Pacific problem is uncertain, and there will be serious turmoil in the future. On the 20th, when President Truman held a flag-raising ceremony with Commander General Eisenhower near Berlin, Truman gave a simple speech stating that America was fighting for peace, not for aggression. His entourage immediately suggested that Truman should add that Europe should not be invaded, but that the Pacific was different, because American congressmen and soldiers all advocated that the islands of the Pacific should be permanently occupied by America. The United States and the Soviet Union are also discussing international guarantees for the colonies that have been created as a result of the war.

### The Opinions of the Three Countries Have Not Reached a Consensus

According to a report from Chongqing by representatives returning after negotiation with the Soviet Union: During two weeks of talks with Soviet Supreme Leader Stalin and People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Molotov in Moscow, the negotiations had to be postponed because Stalin had to attend the three-headed conference. Therefore, the final resolution was not reached. I cannot report it today, and I will report it after the resolution is achieved in the future, please forgive me. Therefore, this negotiation is not easy to resolve the problems in East Asia. Even now, opinions on Japan and the Pacific problems have not reached a consensus. According to other reports, the general election in Britain will not be adjourned until this Thursday. The election in Britain will be completed on about the 25th. Therefore, the three-headed conference is in full swing. In the past, the United States transferred the forces of the Eighth Air Force to the Pacific, and then issued an order to transfer part of the unit to the British occupation zone in Germany. This unit has about 140,000 ground troops, including about 750 aircraft, which have begun to prepare for the move according to the order received on the 21st. Now Europe is full of truce atmosphere, but it is questionable why about 200,000 troops, including aviation forces, are still stationed in Germany together with the British forces. In short, it is too early to discuss the issue of Japan at the three-headed conference, and it is believed that there must be a lack of clarity in the consensus of the three countries.

### U.S. Military Prepares for the Next Operation

Recently, the United States has adjusted its main aviation power in the Pacific. Is its trend toward landing on the Japanese mainland or toward landing on the Chinese mainland? The United States is indeed preparing for its next operation, adjusting the tasks assigned to the army and navy, and reforming the command system. It is difficult to determine at present where the mobile European forces will be deployed and which areas will be attacked. Even the enemy may not have determined their direction yet. As the enemy claims, the main battle is against the Japanese mainland, and the landing on the mainland is a supporting operation. Will they invade the Japanese mainland first and then go to the mainland? Or will they invade the mainland first and then attack the mainland? It is not easy to predict what methods they will adopt. According to enemy announcements, about 4,000 soldiers are being transferred from Europe to the United States every day, totaling 120,000 a month. From May 1 to July 11, the number of soldiers moved was only more than 120,000, and only more than 3,000 aircraft. According to this observation, the US military's movement in Europe is not发挥 the intended capacity, and the enemy's combat policy and the foundation it has formed are not clear even to itself. According to Luci Berthson's meeting with news reporters, the U.S. Army has 4,000 retirees every day, and a total of 2 million retired army personnel. Now it is planned to enroll 800,000 new army recruits to fight against Japan. It can be seen that the United States is now trying to complete the war against Japan with the smallest sacrifice, in order to preserve the strength of the army, which is difficult to achieve ideal success. From this observation, several percent of the US troops in Europe will be suitable for fighting against Japan. At the same time, the United States is full of a peaceful atmosphere, and there are many soldiers who want to retire. Therefore, it is not difficult to imagine the concerns of the methods adopted for the Japanese mainland and coastal landing operations. The enemy's combat direction, according to the opinions of officials such as Nimitz and Dzhinkate, also failed to clearly indicate the direction of the landing. For example, if the United States carries out a coastal landing operation on the mainland, General Mai Ke Vosse will be in charge. He and Southeast Asian Commander General Tebaton negotiated for three days in Manila to discuss how to cooperate on the mainland with coastal landing operations. The Southeast Asian region is 　Burma·Malaysia·Thailand·Vietnam·Dutch India and other places, but Mai Ke Vosse has not yet launched.

### Comparison of the Strengths and Weaknesses of Japanese and American Soldiers

Japanese officers and soldiers compared to European and American officers and soldiers: According to an announcement by the headquarters of the 24th Army Group, which belongs to the American Army Lieutenant General, there are about 10,000 Japanese soldiers lurking in the dangerous mountainous area of northern Okinawa Island. The northern part of Okinawa Island accounts for one-third of the island's area. It is an important land area, and the mountains are connected. The enemy did not dare to fight the Japanese army in this area, in order to avoid the Japanese army's effective mountain warfare. So far, there are many Japanese soldiers in this area, which proves that the Japanese army's combat methods are different from those of the European and American armies. According to a report from Guanhe United Press, since last year, the "mopping up" of Japanese troops on the three islands of Saipan, Guam, and Dienian has been unremitting to this day, and the Japanese army is carrying out fierce guerrilla warfare. Moreover, the enemy also claimed that there are still isolated Japanese garrison troops on the islands of Grand Island, Truk, Palau, and Naban, who are enduring hardships and carrying out strong defenses. And in Rongde Ge Diyi in northern Luzon, they are still carrying out strong battles. And in Bigu in Burma, the Japanese army concentrated its forces and used the rainy season to make strong defenses. The rest, such as the Malay, Sumatran, Java, Borneo, and Celebes areas centered on Zhaonan Island, the Japanese army is still using the area to continue fighting, all of which prove that the Japanese army is full of the strong determination to fight to the end, which is different from that of Europe and the United States. It can be seen that the enemy is willing to be captured, while the Japanese army obeys the will of heaven and continues to fight. Therefore, the enemy is deeply afraid of the Japanese army's battle. If the enemy has not completed the preparations for the war, with the invasion of a small number of troops, they will use politics and strategy as an offensive, hoping to reduce the will of the Japanese people. It is necessary to know that the strong fighting spirit of the Japanese people will not move at all. Even to the last soldier, it is extremely strong, and 100 million people all have a strong belief.

The battle situation in Balikpapan is becoming increasingly fierce, and the distance between the two armies is getting closer.

Southwest Pacific Base, 23rd (Central News Agency dispatch) – The battle situation in Balikpapan is gradually becoming more intense, and the distance between the two armies is getting closer and closer. On the 20th, the enemy attacked with flame throwers as the vanguard, but was repelled by the Japanese army. On the 17th and 18th, the Japanese army wounded about 60 enemy soldiers. It is also said that the Japanese commando team that returned to the base on the 19th annihilated more than 400 enemy soldiers.

Editorial

### Re-Appeal for Disaster Relief Donations

Our newspaper has written articles appealing for the relief of air raid victims, and all parties have enthusiastically donated, showing a warm sentiment, which is a very gratifying phenomenon amidst misfortune.

In just four days since our newspaper started the air raid victim relief donation, we have received more than 10 million yuan in donations, which is a fairly good result. Compared with the scholarship donation, which totaled only 2 million yuan in two weeks, there is a feeling that this one is better than the other. The most admirable thing is that Mr. and Mrs. Sheng Youhui, Zhu Houqing, Jin Xiongbai, and Sun Yidong, etc., each donated as much as 10 million yuan, which is really rare in this era of apathy.

However, judging from the expenses required for various tasks in the current air raid victim relief effort, the 10 million yuan in donations we have received is, in fact, only a "drop in the bucket." Therefore, we hope that citizens from all walks of life in this city will contribute money if they have it. Those who have not yet donated must donate generously, and take it as a shameful disgrace if they have not done their public duty. Moreover, we hope that you will not only donate yourself, but also persuade and encourage relatives and friends to donate as much as possible. Is it true that only the few people named in the newspaper these days are rich enough to do their best for public welfare in Shanghai?

We are convinced that there are many extremely wealthy people in Shanghai, but so far, they do not seem to know that relieving air raid victims is a natural duty, and they do not seem to know that many people are watching you, looking at how much money you donate to this air raid relief movement! According to our estimation, those in Shanghai who have more than 100 million yuan in assets, if each donate only 1% of it, then not only can the air raid relief work be successfully promoted, but also other urgent needs that need to be organized, such as scholarships, can be realized according to the ideal! In fact, for those who own more than 100 million yuan in assets, what a big sacrifice is it to donate one in a thousand? However, if you are willing to donate, you will immediately receive the praise of the whole city!

Judging from the current trend of air raids and bombings, they will inevitably become more frequent in the future, and the sacrifice of citizens' movable and immovable property and lives will naturally become more tragic. Therefore, in addition to constantly hoping that citizens from all walks of life who do not necessarily need to stay in Shanghai will evacuate as soon as possible, we must expand the air raid relief donation movement and call on those in Shanghai who have money to donate generously. We must know that today, residents in Shanghai have the worry of a swallow's nest on a curtain, and under the enemy's air raids, everyone is in danger of perishing at any moment. No matter how rich you are today, bombs do not recognize wealth gods and rich people. Once there is an accident, money cannot redeem life! But if everyone donates generously, so that relief work becomes more perfect day by day, and the relief force becomes more abundant day by day, then all defenses will be more meticulous, and the damage to citizens can be greatly reduced.

We hope that citizens from all walks of life will make persistent efforts to break the record of disaster relief donations!

### American Aircraft Bomb Guangzhou Indiscriminately for Days

Guangzhou, 23rd (Central News Agency dispatch) – Recently, American aircraft have changed their usual slow night air raids on the city, using a large number of aircraft divided into several formations to attack in several waves day and night. The bombs dropped are mostly large bombs ranging from 100 kg to 250 kg, and incendiary bombs are as large as sulfuric acid cylinders. Moreover, the American aircraft's bombing is by no means aimed at military facilities, but indiscriminately bombing the city center and residential areas, so many citizens have been killed and injured, and the disaster situation is tragic.

### Prince Takamatsu Appointed President of the Japanese Red Cross Society

Tokyo, 23rd (Central News Agency dispatch) – After the death of Field Marshal Prince Kan'in, President of the Japanese Red Cross Society, Prince Takamatsu has been requested to succeed him.

### Central Party Headquarters Holds Memorial Week

Nanjing, 23rd (Central News Agency dispatch) – The Central Headquarters of the Chinese Nationalist Party held the 259th Dr. Sun Yat-sen Memorial Week at 10:00 AM on the 23rd in the hall of the headquarters. More than 600 members of the Central Executive and Supervisory Committees, as well as colleagues from the general headquarters and government agencies, who are members of the Kuomintang, attended. Chairman Ma Dianru presided over the ceremony, and reported on "China's Current Situation and Our Future." The ceremony ended at around 11:00 AM.

### Guan Yixian's Opinions on the Current Situation

Beiping, July 23-24 (Central News Agency dispatch) Guan Yixian, Director of the Information Bureau of the North China Political Affairs Commission, expressed his beliefs regarding the "Unification of China" as follows: As the war situation becomes increasingly severe and the decisive stage approaches, it is also a good opportunity for a permanent union between China and Japan. Therefore, it is necessary to practically implement the alliance treaty to seek the permanent co-prosperity of East Asia, in order to achieve China's unification and salvation. The first step is to seek the unified establishment of advocacy and principles in the peaceful region of North China, which is to inherit the Three Principles of the People advocated by Mr. Sun Yat-sen. Apart from respecting the policies shown by Mr. Sun, there is absolutely no other method to follow. Although the ultimate goal of people in Yan'an and Chongqing is also to save China, according to a certain gentleman who was captured by the Yan'an army, the education he received during his three months of detention was a thorough anti-Chiang education. The Chongqing authorities are also trying hard to overthrow Yan'an. However, the China of today does not allow such struggles between parties and factions. The US military's attempt to approach the mainland is to eliminate the Japanese army on the mainland. All of our countrymen must understand that East Asia belongs to the people of East Asia, and China belongs to the Chinese nation. China will never allow the United States to invade. However, Chongqing flatters the United States, and Yan'an relies on being pro-Soviet as a shield against Chiang and Japan. In this situation, only the peaceful region of today can single-handedly complete the mission of saving the country. This is a well-known truth. According to the Greater Asianism of the Father of the Nation, Mr. Sun Yat-sen, it is now clear that we should deeply understand that there is no China without Japan. Therefore, China and Japan must unite with the same hatred and determination to defend East Asia. When the enemy US lands, the compatriots of North China must do their utmost to resist the enemy US, in order to shoulder the heavenly duty of saving the country.

### Taixian Defense Army Encirclement and Suppression of Wandering Bandits

Yangzhou, July 23 (Central News Agency dispatch) According to reports from the 38th Division of the Second Front Army stationed in Taixian: Bandit troops in seven groups and the Jiang Gaoqiao Independent Regiment under Huang Dunfeng and Xu Jincheng, totaling about 5,000 men, were secretly operating near Zhoujiazhuang in the county. A certain regiment of the division launched a night encirclement and suppression campaign against the enemy. After several hand-to-hand combats, the bandits suffered heavy casualties and collapsed. The army pursued and suppressed the bandits, who fled again and are currently being pursued. In this battle, more than 300 bandits were killed, and more than a dozen bodies were left behind.

### The Huai River Floods

Zhuzhaipu, July 23 (Central News Agency dispatch) The Huai River has recently flooded violently, which is unprecedented in history. According to general experience, if the water level does not drop, there may be a disaster in the autumn.

### Chongqing to Import Gold from the US, Agreement Established

Lisbon, July 23 (Central News Agency dispatch) Chongqing news: Song Ziwen attended the National Political Council on the 21st and made the following statement regarding the United Nations' economic aid to Chongqing: When I attended the San Francisco Conference, I negotiated with the US government authorities on issues such as financial aid to Chongqing. The most important issue among the post-war issues is the revitalization of China. Therefore, it is necessary to obtain foreign aid no matter what. The four countries of Britain, the United States, the Soviet Union, and Canada will all discuss providing strong assistance after the war. The most difficult problem at present is the price situation. In order to stabilize prices in Chongqing, gold bricks will soon be imported from the United States. In addition, agreements have been concluded with the United States, Brazil, Mexico, and other countries to supply clothing. These imported goods have been processed and will be transported to Chongqing via India.

Lisbon, July 23 (Central News Agency dispatch) Song Ziwen, President of the Executive Yuan of Chongqing, stated at the National Political Council on the 21st that an agreement to import a large number of gold bricks from the United States has been established. Regarding the use of the gold bricks, according to a Chongqing-US Associated Press dispatch on the 21st, the gold bricks will be sold by the Chongqing government to recover the paper money flooding the market. The Associated Press further reported that the degree of currency inflation under the Chongqing authorities has reached its extreme. The government recently banned the trading of gold, causing the black market price of the US dollar to soar to 3,000 to 1, but it has now fallen slightly and is still 2,600 to 1. The official exchange rate of the US dollar is 100 to 1, so from this, it can also be known how deep the currency inflation in Chongqing is.

### Chongqing National Political Council Closes

### Japan's Ruling and Opposition Parties are Deeply Concerned

Tokyo, July 23 (Central News Agency dispatch) The current international situation surrounding Japan cannot be said to be favorable to Japan. If the East Asian issue is discussed at the Potsdam Conference, the Japanese ruling and opposition parties are deeply concerned about the Soviet Union's attitude. The "Japan Industrial and Economic Weekly," published on the 23rd, has an article on this matter. Therefore, the journal's "International Weekly Outlook" strongly urges the diplomatic authorities to adopt a proactive policy towards the Soviet Union as follows: The Three-Headed Conference held in Potsdam this time will discuss a large number of issues and cannot be concluded in a short period of time. It is expected that the content of the statement issued at the end of the conference will be extremely unfavorable to Japan. We must keep this in mind. While calmly watching the progress of the Three-Headed Conference, we must also do our best to reduce this disadvantage to Japan. Is there anything more urgent today than to exert the Empire's stern diplomacy and guide it to a favorable position?

### Under Heavy Guard, General Pétain to be Tried, Accused of Treason and Harming the Country

Bern, July 23 (Central News Agency dispatch) According to information obtained here: The 89-year-old hero of Verdun, former French Marshal Pétain, was transferred from Fort Yetru in a police car to the Paris court yesterday afternoon, just like an ordinary criminal. At 1:00 pm today, he will be tried on the double charges of treason and harming the country. Prosecutor Monnat, who is 75 years old, strongly insisted that Pétain be sentenced to death. Madame Pétain, a prison doctor, and two female charity members accompanied the old man. When the police car drove from Montreuil to the local court, the police strictly guarded the road. Pétain was held in two small air spaces in the court, quietly waiting to be brought to the first court for questioning. Newspaper reporters were extremely disappointed because they could not all be allowed to enter. Only 400 of them were able to obtain special permits to attend. All diplomats and famous people were also forbidden to attend the trial. Five hundred officers and soldiers armed with weapons strictly guarded the doors and windows of each passage. Only when he lived in the two small rooms, the steel windows were placed high. The eagerly awaited trial period for the public over the past two weeks has finally arrived. Pétain wanted to explain how France initially surrendered. On the one hand, the prosecutor's voice trembled, and he urgently wanted to accuse him of selling the country. In front of three judges in red robes and a jury of 24 (12 representatives from the Upper House and 12 representatives from the Lower House), the two old men revealed a unique truth about how France collapsed and how it was revived. Since Louis XVI, the people of France had never seen such a heart-wrenching and tense trial. The people in Paris all said, "Pétain is on trial, and millions of French people are also on trial." Forty prosecution and defense witnesses all attended. Professor Luzhian's testimony was read aloud, and its content roughly stated, "In 1940, the envoy had a secret agreement with the British government, but the British Foreign Office has repeatedly denied it recently. At the same time, Dr. Starki, the former Swiss Foreign Minister in Vichy, also stated that it was inaccurate."

### List of Charges

After that came the reading of a long indictment with three main themes: "Facts," "Morality," and "Politics," totaling about eleven articles. Under the first article, "Facts," the defendant personally signed the "Armistice Agreement," suppressed the powers of the President of the French Republic, cut off great powers, and delayed the French Senate and House of Representatives.

Under the second article, "Morality," he annexed the French Republic (it is said that Pétain had a letter to the leader of the Bao party, Moras, stating that he deeply hoped that France could restore its historical monarchical era, had a relationship with the Mibing fascist party, approached Datingte, the leader of Laider's civil army, maintained a relationship with Zaxi, the German diplomatic ambassador Buli Nong, and received Laider as the head of the French government.

Under the third article, "Politics," he devoted himself to accepting the name of "defeat" regardless of the shame of defeat; in 1940, when Pétain secretly accepted the cooperation between the victor and the defeated, he met with Hitler in Montoir, which damaged France's prestige; he revised the German constitution and regarded Jews as communists, used it, placed all French industries under German control, participated in military cooperation, provided French combatants to Germany, supported the organization of the French civil army, and resisted the Soviet army in East Germany; he did not allow the French army in the French bases in Syria and Tunisia to surrender to the United Nations, but instead provided the airports in Syria and Lebanon for Germany to use; he ordered the French army in the area to fire on the United Nations army, sink French warships in United Nations or neutral ports, and disregarded General de Gaulle's call, and other crimes.

### Thorough Reorganization of the Spanish Government

Lisbon, July 23 (Central News Agency dispatch) According to a telegram from Madrid: The Franco government finally reorganized the cabinet and announced the main candidates for each department on the 20th as follows: Head of Government Franco, Foreign Minister Malkin (newly appointed leader of the Catholic Party), Minister of the Army Alonde (newly appointed royalist), Minister of the Navy Regaldo (newly appointed royalist), Minister of the Air Force Galarize (newly appointed royalist), and Minister of Finance Brin (newly appointed royalist). According to the above news, the former Secretary-General of the Spanish Nationalist Party and Minister Without Portfolio Alese, the Nationalist Party opposition Foreign Minister Lek Ke, and the Minister of Justice Oos have been transferred, which is very noteworthy. In addition to the five newly joined royalists, five members of the Nationalist Party have also joined the new cabinet. From this, it can be seen that Franco's current cabinet is actually a mixed organization that draws together the Spanish royalists and various factions of the Nationalist Party to maintain its current position.

### Partition of Italy Plan

News still awaits confirmation

Stockholm, July 23 (Central News Agency dispatch) According to news from Rome: The Socialist Party's newspaper "Avanti" recently published a new opening of an official US document, the content of which briefly stated the US authorities' policy on how to deal with Italy.

### Idle Talk of Penglang

— Pu Xi

Penglang Town — built on the banks of the north-south flowing Wapu River, half belonging to Kunshan County and half to Taicang County. It is 24 li from Shandongmen to the town. There are three sailing boats that travel between the two places daily. It is only nine li away from Tianfu'an Station on the Beijing-Shanghai Railway. Currently, people travel to and from here to take the train, with one train a day and sailing boats for transportation, which is considered convenient. Going east from the town for 36 li reaches Jiading, where there are buses that can reach Shanghai to the east and Suzhou to the west, but the time is slightly longer.

Population and Commerce

Before the war, the town had a population of about 5,000. After the war, due to its remote location, a bit far from the railway and highway, and not a major waterway, many people moved to the town from various places. The population increased dramatically, suddenly causing overcrowding. Therefore, there is a severe shortage of housing. Although there are no tricks like "digging fees" or "tips," it is extremely difficult to find a place to settle down. The market has experienced abnormal prosperity after the war, with many new shops opening, and its business is the best among the surrounding villages, almost surpassing Kunshan. However, it has gradually declined in the past year. Owners of rice mills, rice shops, oil presses, sauce shops, and yarn shops have all made fortunes through hoarding and speculation, especially by transporting local grain to Jiading and Nanxiang, which yields huge profits. However, the daily business of ordinary shops is only enough to support the family. Although the chips are getting bigger and bigger, the inventory decreases day by day. Moreover, taxes and levies are heavy, with endless tricks, causing everyone to complain bitterly.

Daily necessities and foreign goods all rely on peddlers to transport them from Shanghai. Local products from the interior come from Suzhou, Changshu, and Zhujiajiao. There are "Shaoxing boats" that travel everywhere. The price of foreign goods in the town is more expensive than in the surrounding areas. The town is surrounded by rice paddies and vegetable fields, which are not even enough for the farmers to feed themselves, so they mostly rely on the vicinity of Taicang. Therefore, the price of vegetables in the town is often more expensive than in Shanghai. Since prices have been rising continuously, families with moderate incomes feel increasingly difficult to make a living. As a result, every household, men, women, old and young, are mobilized to carry rice from Kunshan through the town to Waigang and Jiading for sale, because the market prices in the two places differ greatly, and a single trip can earn tens of thousands of yuan.

Military Affairs, Politics, and Education

Local security relies on the military to maintain it. The Peace Preservation Army is stationed here, managed by a company commander, and the discipline is quite good. There is also a police station. As for administrative organs, it belongs to the Fifth District of Kunshan County, and the district office is located in the town. There is also a bell tower. In addition to the county government's regular expenses, most of the funds for the above-mentioned organs are taken from the local area, with monthly expenses of about 6 million yuan. There are also temporary donations, averaging 5,000 yuan per person per month, some of which are misappropriated, causing public resentment.

Before the war, the level of culture and education was the highest among all towns in the county, and talented people emerged in large numbers, most of whom served in the education sector. The China and Guohua two schools in Shanghai were both founded by fellow villagers from here. After the war, due to the high cost of living, many young people dropped out of school. There is currently a county-run elementary school with about 200 students, mostly female teachers. The principal is a local and does not often come to school. The academic level is extremely low, and tuition is about 4,000 yuan per person on average per semester.

Folk Customs

Upon entering the town, one can see hotels and teahouses filled with people, shouting and clapping, with constant noise. Even more blatant is the open secret — the "telegram room" (opium and heroin selling place). On the streets, one can often encounter old addicts with faces like death, "ears drooping to their shoulders, and hands reaching past their knees." Some are sons of wealthy families, and some are local dignitaries. Apart from public prostitutes, everything else is available here.

Besides the prevalence of smoking, gambling, and drinking, there are two other things in abundance: doctors and cesspools. If one inspects the entire town, one sees doctors' signs and advertisements everywhere; cesspools overflowing with stench everywhere. Residents pay no attention to hygiene; in the town's river, people can wash chamber pots upstream and rinse rice downstream, throwing garbage everywhere and urinating in public. The town is full of "national doctors" who have only three years of apprenticeship and can even give intravenous injections.

Religious Beliefs

Villagers have very little faith in religion. Most residents are Buddhists, and very few are Christians. The "net boat people" who live on the water all believe in Catholicism. Last spring, a person from another town established a Yiguandao (Way of Unity) in the town, offering sacrifices to Maitreya Buddha. On the first, twelfth, fifteenth, and twenty-sixth days of each month, believers must be vegetarian and worship in the temple. At the beginning of joining the sect, in addition to paying fees, the host teaches them a five-character mantra, which is not allowed to be revealed to outsiders, otherwise they will be punished by heaven and earth. For a time, many followed, mostly women and children.

Production Conditions

Although the surrounding area is a rice-producing area, the land is poor, with insufficient fertilization, and the farming methods are outdated. Therefore, the annual autumn harvest is often not satisfactory. Last year's insect plague resulted in an average yield of about three to four dou per mu, which is not even enough for local self-sufficiency. In addition, with the collection of rice and smuggling, the countryside's rice reserves are empty. Wealthy farmers rely on selling rice to make a living, while poor and middle peasants rely on wheat bran and coarse grains to feed themselves. The price of rice was only 30,000 yuan per shi at the end of last year, but it rose to 80,000 yuan in February this spring, and recently it has been increasing day and night, reaching 700,000 yuan! As the saying goes, "cheap grain hurts farmers," now grain is extremely expensive, but the countryside relies on selling grain to live, so life is even more difficult. Fortunately, the summer harvest was abundant, so they were able to barely overcome the difficulties.

"Men till and women weave" was once praised as a beautiful thing. Old-fashioned looms in our country are operated by hand and foot. The woven cloth is narrow, only a little over one foot wide, and the length is at most forty feet, and the patterns are monotonous. Although it is durable, it is not very attractive. Recently, there are four-treadle looms in the countryside (originally two-treadle), which can weave twill, mixed with silk, and are no different from wool. As a result, every household is vying to imitate them, and the sound of the looms fills everywhere. This kind of cloth is worth about 40,000 to 50,000 yuan, depending on the width, length, and the skill of the weaver. Skilled women can weave three zhang of cloth a day, earning several thousand yuan to supplement their household income.

Youth Trends

Rural youth are fond of fashion and mostly idle. If they don't cause major trouble, they join the "guerrilla隊", relying on it as a backing, resisting rent and taxes, extorting and extorting, without any scruples. There is no shortage of active people in the villages, but those who are near vermilion get stained red, and they are influenced by what they see and hear, and gradually become accustomed to it. Thus, a group of people become fond of eating and lazy. Their only entertainment is mahjong, and it is rare to see two or three young people reading novels.

Newspaper Delivery

Penglang Town is more than seventy li away from Shanghai. Newspapers are delivered every other day, with newspaper vendors delivering them from Anting via Wangxian Bridge and Qianmentang. There are Shen Bao and Zhonghua Daily, each costing 450 yuan; the Shanghai News costs 500 yuan, with total sales of about 100 copies. This newspaper vendor is a farmer and walks all the way, so the delivery is intermittent during busy farming seasons or rainy days. There is a postal agency in the town, entrusted to a shop to act as an agent. Traditionally, the delivery person charges a subsidy of 50 yuan per letter for incoming mail. If it is registered, express, or a package, the fee is doubled. This money is collected by the agency and is not a postal regulation, so disputes often arise.

The Desolate Datong Temple

Datong Temple is three li south of Penglang Town. There are two ginkgo trees in front of the temple, said to be from the Southern Song Dynasty. They are about ten embraces thick and more than five or six zhang tall. Next to the temple is Datong Bridge. Twenty years ago, the ginkgo tree in front of the temple caught fire and burned from the inside, but it was quickly extinguished. For a time, it was rumored as a miracle, and pious men and women from Shanghai and Suzhou came to the temple to burn incense and worship Buddha, begging for immortal pills to cure diseases, reaching a peak for a month or so before declining. The income from incense was used to rebuild Datong Temple, making it magnificent and majestic. During the "August 13th" Incident, it was completely destroyed in a fire, leaving only the surrounding walls. The ginkgo tree was unharmed, and in spring, the ground is still covered with shade. Currently, there are thatched sheds built in the temple, enshrining several Buddha statues that survived the fire, some with broken hands and feet, or incomplete clothing, creating a desolate scene. Every year on the thirtieth day of the seventh lunar month, pious men and women from the villages come to offer apricot porridge, bustling with noise and liveliness.

A brief description of the current situation of Penglang is provided for readers' reference and to inform fellow villagers scattered everywhere who are concerned about their hometown.

### Air Raid Relief Committee Promotes Relief Fundraising Work; Medical Team to Meet This Afternoon to Discuss

The Shanghai Citizens Welfare Association, in order to handle relief work for citizens who have suffered from air raids, has established an Air Raid Relief Committee, divided into fundraising, medical, and relief teams, and has recommended candidates for each team. It is now known that a general affairs team has been added, and Wu Junxiang, Sun Yidong, Yang Fusheng, Chen Binqian, etc., have been appointed to be responsible. Yesterday, the fundraising team and relief team of the association held meetings respectively, and the medical team is scheduled to hold its first meeting at 5:00 PM today at the General Headquarters of the Chinese Red Cross Society on Xinzha Road. The minutes of the relief team and fundraising team meetings of the association yesterday are recorded as follows:

### Fundraising Team Decides on Programs

The fundraising team held its first meeting at Daguan Garden on Ciyun Temple Road at 4:00 PM yesterday (22nd). Attendees included Lin Kanghou, Yuan Ludeng, Zhang Yunqing, Zhu Boquan, Jin Xiongbai, and representatives from all walks of life, including Zheng Peimin, Sun Xiqing, Zhang Zhongyuan, Yang Qingju, Yuan Senru, Zhang Zhesheng, Liu Feichun, Wang Shuying, Lin Zhifu, Zhu Peiqing, Wang Guizhang, Xu Zidong, Xu Guangming, Shi Jifu, Lu Zhicheng, Xie Hengkang, and dozens of others.

### Central Bank of China's Three Special Promissory Notes Are Now Redeemed for Cash; Can Be Redeemed at CBC Branches and Various Banks and Qianzhuang

In order to relieve the cash panic, the Central Bank of China (CBC) previously invited the heads of various financial institutions to discuss the lack of cash in the market and the illegal operations of unscrupulous colleagues in speculating on cash premiums, in order to carry out rectification and correction. After discussion, the CBC decided to issue three special promissory notes of 10,000, 50,000, and 100,000 yuan, taking them out of circulation and using them as cash to supplement the insufficient supply of cash. It is now known that the bank has begun to redeem the three special promissory notes for cash from yesterday (23rd). Citizens holding CBC special promissory notes of 10,000 yuan, 50,000 yuan, and 100,000 yuan can redeem them for cash at the CBC's Shanghai branch and the West and South District offices, as well as at various banks and qianzhuang, and redemption cannot be refused.

### Qianye Asks for More Cash to Be Issued

Because of the cash shortage, the silver and money industries in this city previously requested the Central Bank of China to issue more cash. At the end of last month, the requested amount was appropriately allocated to various banks and qianzhuang. Subsequently, the amount was gradually increased, and the cash position was slightly looser than before. It is now known that the cash issued by the CBC to the banking industry is based on the ratio of each bank's various deposits, reaching more than 5%, and there are intentions to increase it further. Therefore, various banks have respectively relaxed the weekly percentage of cash withdrawals for depositors, with the highest reaching a deposit of 1 million yuan per week, which can be withdrawn at 100%, and the minimum is also more than 20%. However, the cash used by the qianzhuang industry from the CBC accounts for only 2% of each deposit amount, making it very difficult to meet depositors' cash withdrawal needs. Depositors often complain, and some may even run away with their money. Moreover, qianzhuang are licensed by the Ministry of Finance, just like banks, but the amount of cash they can withdraw from the CBC is not treated equally with banks. Based on the above difficulties, the Qianzhuang Association has submitted a request to the CBC authorities. It is reported that the CBC considers the industry's request to be reasonable and will grant it in the near future.

### Central Naval Training Institute Held Opening Ceremony Yesterday

The Central Naval Training Institute held the opening ceremony for the 13th term of recruits and the 3rd term of ordinary merchant seamen at 10:00 AM yesterday (23rd) in the school's auditorium. The attendees included Yang Xibu, representative of the Minister of the Navy and Director of the Naval Headquarters in Shanghai, Chen Ruijin, Director of the Central Naval Training Institute, Miya Yoshito, Chief Instructor, and dozens of Chinese and Japanese naval officers and guests. After the ceremony, the Director appointed the graduates of the 13th term of recruits and the 3rd term of ordinary merchant seamen, and the new students paid their respects to the Director and the guests. Then Director Chen gave a speech, followed by a speech by Director Yang, representing the Minister of the Navy, urging everyone to understand that the people contribute various taxes to the country to nurture us, and we should protect the people and give society a good impression. Afterwards, Chief Instructor Miya gave a congratulatory speech, with many words of encouragement. Finally, all the students took an oath, and then sang the Navy Song in unison, declaring the ceremony complete.

### Gold Securities Market Changed to One Session

According to news from the Gold Securities Market, after adjusting the business hours yesterday, and as the fourth-term gold securities have expired, they have been incorporated into the trading of expired gold securities. In order to facilitate trading, it was originally planned to open two sessions during the trading hours of the scheduled gold securities, but now it has been changed to open one session.

### Gold Securities Market Conditions

After the Gold Securities Market opened yesterday, because the fourth term had expired, it was incorporated into the expired securities. As a result of the trading, due to more demand than supply, the price rose, with only five taels traded. The prices are recorded as follows:

Opening price: 10.24 million yuan; Closing price: 10.24 million yuan, an increase of 2.04 million yuan compared to Saturday.

### Laozha Police Station Cracked a Forged Promissory Note Organization, Fraudulently Using Tens of Millions of Yuan

Recently, due to the shortage of cash in the city, and the proliferation of payment orders and promissory notes, some unscrupulous individuals have been forging or altering payment orders and promissory notes to defraud money. The police station has repeatedly cracked down and brought them to justice. The Laozha Branch recently cracked a large forged promissory note organization, and eight suspects have been detained. Forged banknotes, documents, seals, and other forgery tools were seized on the spot. The details are as follows:

### Eight Suspects Arrested One After Another

The third section of the Laozha Branch received a tip on the 18th of this month that unscrupulous individuals were forging promissory notes at No. 210 and No. 228 Tianran Hotel on Zhizhong Road and using them to defraud large sums of money. The section chief ordered police officer Yang Heping and detective Ning Tong to go to the above-mentioned locations. They first surrounded the rooms at No. 210 and No. 228, and then rushed into the rooms, arresting Yang Jinlin (40 years old, resident of No. 186 Laoshifu Road) and Li Atang (19 years old, resident of No. 62 Rongshi Road) on the spot and detaining them. Meanwhile, they sent people to wait for the main suspects to appear. The main suspects, Xu Yougen (24 years old, resident of No. 202 Daxing Road), Chen Shuikang (21 years old, resident of Lane 13, No. 214 Daxing Road), and other suspects, Yang Xiaodi, Gu Fugen, Mao Genlin, and other eight suspects, were successively arrested and taken to the police station for interrogation.

### Fraudulently Used Tens of Millions of Yuan in the Market

After careful investigation by Police Officer Yang and others, it was learned that the forgery of promissory notes was initiated by Xu Yougen and Chen Shuikang. The other suspects were recruited by Xu and Chen. After repeated discussions, Xu and Chen came forward to rent rooms at the Tianran Hotel and successively purchased about 100 blank promissory notes from the Shanghai Vegetable and Grain Dealers' Association. Then, they secretly engraved two seals, "Jian Kang" and "Niu Tai," and dozens of date stamps. After stamping them on the blank promissory notes, Chen Shuikang was responsible for writing the signatures, all signing "Tao Chengyan" on the notes. The amount filled in ranged from hundreds of thousands of yuan. For more than ten days, they fraudulently used them in the market, amounting to tens of millions of yuan. On that day, a payment order worth 1 million yuan that had not yet been used was also seized in the room. All the suspects confessed to the crimes they had committed. As the case is of great importance, the section is still conducting a thorough investigation and hopes that citizens will pay attention. If they have any forged promissory notes signed "Tao Chengyan," they should report to the section as soon as possible in order to compile statistics and close the case.

### Traffic Regulation Strengthening Week to Be Implemented Starting Tomorrow; Cracking Down on Illegal Vehicles and Pedestrians

The City Police Department has found that the traffic order in the city has been deteriorating recently, with various violations and accidents involving vehicles occurring frequently. If this continues, it will not only harm the appearance of the city but also hinder traffic safety. Therefore, after contacting the military authorities, it will implement the "Traffic Regulation Strengthening Week" starting tomorrow (25th) until the 31st of this month. From 8:30 AM to 10:30 AM and 5:00 PM to 7:00 PM every day, military police and Baojia self-defense personnel will be assigned to designated major and minor traffic points to direct traffic and crack down on illegal vehicles or pedestrians.

### Military Police Personnel to Be Organized and Equipped

The composition and equipment are as follows: (A) Major road traffic: Two to three traffic officers from the branch, two to three police officers from the police team, eight to ten Baojia self-defense team members, and one to two soldiers. (B) Minor road traffic points: One to two traffic officers from the branch, one to two police officers from the police team, and four to five Baojia self-defense team members. Their tasks are to control traffic signals, crack down on violations of traffic regulations, and thoroughly implement various traffic rules. The equipment of the traffic police officers in command includes white-sleeved caps, batons, police whistles, and report books.

### Handling Violations

Regarding (A) the crackdown items: Strictly adhere to left-side traffic, pedestrians should walk on the sidewalk, rickshaws and carts should travel on the left side of the curb, and motor vehicles should drive on the left side of the road in the center of the road. Thoroughly implement traffic rules and appendices. Traffic signals at intersections must be absolutely and accurately followed. (B) Handling of violators: The citizen's ID, residence permit, and driver's license of repeat offenders will be suspended at the branch and dealt with as a violation. Other violators will be fined a small amount by the branch based on the facts of the violation. However, the attitude of guiding the public should be absolutely sincere, and efforts should be made to promote traffic ethics.

### Road Protection Work Promotion Association Held Inaugural Meeting Yesterday

The Road Protection Work Promotion Association held its inaugural meeting on the second floor of the Ducheng Hotel yesterday (23rd) at 3:00 PM and held a tea party to entertain people from all walks of life. The meeting started on time. First, Yao Mou of the association reported on the preparation process, saying: "Since the preparation of this association began on May 7th of this year, three preparatory meetings have been held successively, and after more than ten group discussions, the preparatory work has been largely completed. We are deeply grateful for the assistance of all parties concerned during this period. The reasons for the formation of this association are: Unite the staff of the national railway and strive for the improvement of road administration; Promote the understanding of the importance of railways among the people along the line and integrate with them to minimize the suffering of the people; Strive to do our job well, be determined to improve, and eliminate the negative impression of society on us." Then, President Zheng of China Railway and Section Chief Okuda gave speeches with much encouragement, clarifying the mission of the Road Protection Work Promotion Association, and announcing that the association must integrate with the people in the future so that the people understand that China Railway is a tool of the people themselves and protect it. Subsequently, Wen Lanting and Yuan Ludeng gave speeches on behalf of each other, hoping that the staff of the association could earnestly work to complete their mission, facilitate transportation, and benefit the people. Finally, representatives of various social organizations gave speeches successively, and representatives of various members expressed their opinions. Then the tea party began, and everyone chatted happily until it dispersed at 5:00 PM.

### Two Major Wishes at Present: Disaster Relief Should Not Forget Helping Students; Helping Students Should Not Forget Disaster Relief

There are two major events in Shanghai that require everyone to contribute money and effort: The first is to relieve the citizens who suffered in the air raids, and the second is to relieve the young people who will be out of school. Disaster relief is indeed an urgent matter that cannot be delayed. How to bury the dead? How to rescue the injured? How to settle the separated wives and children? How to rebuild the damaged homes? All of these require a lot of money to prepare, and money and effort must be continuously contributed. I believe that in this emergency, everyone will see through the philosophy of life, and everyone will be willing to contribute and spend money. This is the most valuable empathy of mankind and the most admirable spirit of mutual assistance.

However, helping students is second only to disaster relief. Cultivating young people is a "century-long plan," and it cannot be ignored. Therefore, I say "Disaster relief should not forget helping students," hoping that people in Shanghai will donate money and effort, mostly for disaster relief, and a part for helping students. In this way, we can take care of both sides and achieve two goals at once, which is the greatest good!

### Enthusiastic Application for "Family Doctor" Scholarship Aid

Since the "Family Doctor" scholarship aid campaign began accepting applications yesterday, students from various schools have flocked to the YMCA and this newspaper to obtain application forms in an endless stream, demonstrating the students' dedication to supporting education, which is truly commendable! Several points must be clarified: Students already receiving aid from this newspaper do not need to fill out a form; they can simply bring their student ID to this office tomorrow (the 25th) from 2:00 PM to 4:30 PM to collect their books. University, college, high school, and junior high school students should obtain the application form, fill it out completely, and submit it to this office, or mail it in with a forty-yuan postal fee. After the application is reviewed and approved, a book collection certificate will be mailed to them, which they can use to collect their books at this office. A total of 100,000 copies of "Family Doctor" are available. Therefore, this office and the YMCA hope to mobilize as many students as possible to promote sales. Students can introduce and encourage fellow students who are willing to help, and participate together. If 2,000 students are mobilized, and each sells an average of 50 copies, then the 100,000 copies can be sold out in the shortest possible time. This will provide significant support to the scholarship fund, and thousands of impoverished students will receive unexpected benefits. Therefore, this newspaper and the other two organizations have the greatest expectations for the "Family Doctor" scholarship aid campaign.

### Honorary Teams

Eleventh Team: Four Seasons Cottage Team: 1,000,000 yuan

Total above: 12,000,000 yuan

### Ordinary Teams

Sixtieth Team: Huai Ren Team: 500,000 yuan

Sixty-first Team: Qiu Zhengcheng Team: 200,000 yuan

Sixty-second Team: Chen Zhi Team: 100,000 yuan

Sixty-third Team: Zheng Xingyan Team: 100,000 yuan

Total above: 900,000 yuan, bringing the previous total to 12,935,500 yuan.

(Note) We sincerely thank Four Seasons Cottage for their generous donation of 1,000,000 yuan to establish an honorary doctor team. The owner of the cottage's enthusiasm for supporting education is deeply appreciated. The Huai Ren Team's generous donation of 500,000 yuan is truly commendable. Mr. Qiu Zhengcheng, Mr. Chen Zhijian, and Mr. Zheng Xingyan also each sponsored a team. Their kindness is greatly appreciated. As the saying goes, philanthropists from all walks of life who have a kind heart, should do more fundraising and contribute money and effort. The motivation for doing good is the same. If we can have a new lineup, with dozens or even a hundred teams listed daily, the future of scholarship aid will be bright, which would not only benefit the colleagues of this newspaper, but also the thousands of poor students.

Yesterday's donations: 753 Da Shanghai Road: 60,000 yuan. Jiang Zeyitang: 30,000 yuan. Zuo Genfa, Liu Chuanhan: 50,000 yuan each. Zhou Shichang, Jia Shang School Alumni: 20,000 yuan each. Wu Yuefang, San De Tang: 10,000 yuan each. Yang Tian: 5,000 yuan. Wu Bojing: 3,000 yuan. Total above: 258,000 yuan.

### Red Flower Café License Revoked

The Municipal Police Department strictly manages the operating hours of special business entertainment venues, and absolutely prohibits overtime operation. It has ordered all branch offices to strictly investigate and prohibit any violations. The Red Flower Café on Yu Yuan Road in West Shanghai was found to have repeatedly violated regulations and operated overtime, so its business license has been revoked.

### Police Officer's Extortion Case Concluded, Sentences Announced Based on Severity

The Shanghai Branch of the People's Government Special Court announced the verdict yesterday (the 23rd) in the case of Battalion Commander Zong Xin and others' extortion of civilian property. A total of nine suspects were involved. After the trial, Zong Xin and five others were sentenced separately based on their crimes. The remaining two suspects, Xie Xuanjia and Shen Junyou, were acquitted because the evidence of their guilt could not be proven, and the Chairman of the National Government approved their release. Two other defendants, Li Hongchun and Wang Xiu'an, were not civil servants, so their conduct constituted robbery under Article 330, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Law, which does not comply with Article 1 of the Organization Regulations. Therefore, the court had no jurisdiction to sentence them. This was also discussed and approved by the President of the National Government, and they were transferred to the Shanghai Local Prosecutor's Office for investigation according to law. Details of the case are as follows:

### Criminal Events

Zong Xin, a police officer from the Huashan Road Police Station in this city, at 10:00 PM on June 7th of this year, along with Zhang Wenfu, a police officer from the Changshu Road Police Station who was on the run, dressed in uniform and carrying a service pistol, and accompanied by Liu Zhenxiang, Rong Genfa, and Liu Guangyou and A Si, who were on the run, went to No. 4, Lane 537, West Road. Entering the home of Gao Liren Jinpu Kuan, who sold opium, from the back door, they intimidated him and failed. Zhang Wenfu then showed his pistol, and Liu Guangyou obtained a small cloth bag containing 5,000 yuan in cash and 10,000 yuan in bills for distribution. At about 8:00 PM on March 2nd, Zong Xin again carried a service pistol, a empty magazine, and accompanied by Liu Zhenxiang, Rong Genfa, Feng Weihai, and Lu Dekuan, who had been sentenced for robbery by the former Shanghai First Special District Local Court in February 30th and had completed his sentence in September 30th, went to No. 31, Lane 137, Zhejiang Road. Entering the home of a Korean man selling drugs, whose name is unknown, from the back door, they forcibly took a small cloth bag containing 1,800 yuan in cash and twelve small bags of morphine. They then divided it in Room 40 of the New China Hotel. Liu and Lu each received 600 yuan in cash, Qing Genfa and Feng Weihao each received four small bags of morphine, and Zong Xin received 600 yuan in cash and four small bags of morphine. Liu Xi of the Taishan Branch discovered the matter and raided the room that night. The original items were found on Liu Zhenxiang, Lu Dekuan, Rong Genfa, and Jiang Zongxin. The case was submitted to the mayor and then to the National Government for review by the court.

### Sentences Pronounced

The court ruled that Zong Xin, in collusion and continuously seeking illegal profits, abused his power and used violence and coercion to extort property from the people, and sentenced him to fifteen years of imprisonment, a fine of 50,000 yuan, and permanent deprivation of public rights. If he is unable to pay the fine, the term of imprisonment will be converted based on the ratio of the total amount of the fine to six months. Lu Dekuan, seeking illegal profits and abusing his power to extort property from the people, is a recidivist and is sentenced to life imprisonment, a fine of 50,000 yuan, and permanent deprivation of public rights. If he is unable to pay the fine, the term of imprisonment will be converted based on the ratio of the total amount of the fine to six months. Liu Zhenxiang and Rong Genfa, in collusion and continuously seeking illegal profits, used violence and coercion to extort property from the people, and are each sentenced to twelve years of imprisonment, a fine of 50,000 yuan, and permanent deprivation of public rights. If they are unable to pay the fine, the term of imprisonment will be converted based on the ratio of the total amount of the fine to six months. Feng Weihao, in collusion seeking illegal profits and abusing his power to extort property from the people, is sentenced to ten years of imprisonment, a fine of 50,000 yuan, and permanent deprivation of public rights. If he is unable to pay the fine, the term of imprisonment will be converted based on the ratio of the total amount of the fine to six months. The eight small bags of morphine and the 1,800 yuan in cash are confiscated. The 15,000 yuan that has already been used is also confiscated.

### Donations Continue to Pour In From All Sectors

A letter from the staff of the Yizhong Tobacco Company of Pudong states: "Since the city suffered air raids, the bombed areas have seen families ruined, bodies abandoned on the roads, and the devastation is unbearable to witness. Post-disaster relief work depends on the active promotion of all sectors of society. Our team members, in response, have collected savings of 877,900 yuan, which we are sending to your office for use as air raid relief funds. Although this is a drop in the bucket, it is the hard-earned reward of each person. Donating is to seek peace of mind. We sincerely hope that all sectors of society and enthusiastic people will actively donate to achieve effective relief and comfort the disaster-stricken people. We cannot stop hoping."

A letter from the Provincial Association states: "Our colleagues, seeing that our city has suffered air raids and many compatriots have been victimized, have initiated a donation of medical and emergency supplies to help in a small way. We are enclosing a cashier's check for 730,000 yuan. Please receive it accordingly."
