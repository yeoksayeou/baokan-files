### Fierce Battles Continue in the Clark Mountain Area; Japanese Naval Landing Forces Assault Enemy Rear

Philippines Base, 15th (Central News Agency) - In coordination with army units, Japanese naval landing forces quickly launched fierce battles in the Clark Mountain area, dealing a severe blow to the enemy's plans. On February 12th, enemy forces again led local militias to invade Japanese positions, launching repeated attacks, but after fierce hand-to-hand combat by the brave Japanese naval landing forces, they inflicted great damage.

Philippines Base, 15th (Central News Agency) - A commando unit of the Japanese naval landing forces penetrated deep behind enemy lines from the vicinity of Manila on February 9th, attacking their rear positions and encampments, resulting in the destruction of six artillery pieces. Furthermore, Japanese forces ambushed and routed over a dozen fleeing enemy officers and others, killing them all with swords before returning in triumph.

Luzon Front, 15th (Central News Agency) - The street fighting in Manila is an extremely tragic and valiant affair. The American forces, to achieve their goals, are sacrificing Filipinos. When the American troops charged into Manila, they first had a large number of bandits sneak into various parts of the city to set fires at will. At the same time, they incited the citizens of Manila, provided them with weapons, and drove them to the front lines of the American forces to act as cannon fodder against the Japanese. In addition, armed residents are stationed in front of American positions to defend against the sharp attacks of Japanese assault troops. Some of these residents have joined forces with bandits, taking the opportunity to plunder at will. Therefore, historical monuments such as churches have been largely destroyed. The city of Manila has now become a living hell due to the bloody battles of the Allied forces and the rampage of the mobs.

Japanese Army and Navy Secure the Southern Area of Manila

Luzon Front, 15th (Central News Agency) - It has been ten days since enemy forces invaded Manila. Currently, the enemy is continuously reinforcing and supplying the enemy forces surging into the city with hundreds of vehicles every day, subjecting Japanese positions to intense artillery bombardment. Under the cover of this artillery fire, they launch repeated attacks. However, with the close cooperation of Japanese naval and army units, they have fought bravely every day. On the 13th, they continued to secure the southern area of the four bridges downstream of the Pasig River and the area between Garina, secured from the north-south line of the Paco base to the Sicalen Road. They also strictly defended the eastern area of the Nichols Field south of the city and the northern bank position of the upper Pasig River, which was captured by Captain Nishiyama's unit in a surprise attack on the night of the 12th, continuing their fierce offensive. The Japanese unit commander instructed all members of each unit, saying: "All members should bravely kill the enemy. If aid is cut off from the rear or when walking becomes difficult, they should strive to overcome these difficulties and uphold the honor of Japanese men." The morale of the entire army is extremely firm. A seven-man flesh-and-blood assault team broke into enemy lines, destroying two 120mm mortars and four 80mm mortars with hand grenades, and killing dozens of enemy soldiers. On the way back, they also killed an enemy officer and seized important documents. Currently, hand-to-hand combat is raging everywhere on all fronts, and American losses are becoming increasingly severe. Therefore, since the 13th, enemy forces have constructed mortar and heavy machine gun positions in the southern coastal area of the city, the Basse district, and near the Ybor Club.

Enemy Fleet Discovered off Corregidor

Luzon Front, 15th (Central News Agency) - The enemy recently attempted to forcibly invade Manila Bay. At 9:30 AM on the 13th, a fleet consisting of two battleships, four cruisers, and five destroyers appeared off Corregidor Island, conducting naval bombardment and intense aerial attacks. At that time, the Japanese batteries on Corregidor bravely returned fire. That evening, the enemy reappeared with twenty minesweepers in the northern waterway of Corregidor Island, resulting in one being sunk by Japanese forces. Furthermore, about ten enemy transport ships were approaching that area. Since January 26th, the enemy has been reconnoitering the Aparri area north of Luzon Island and attacking fiercely. After February, they continued reconnaissance for days. At 11:30 AM on the 13th, they continuously bombed and strafed the Aparri coastal area with 100 carrier-based aircraft for over half an hour.

Luzon Front, 15th (Central News Agency) - The enemy is extremely anxious to capture Manila. They are currently increasing the strength of the southbound forces and striving to advance the landing forces in Nasugbu and Subic Bays, and also attempting to invade Manila Bay. They have continued to reconnoiter and bomb Corregidor Island for days. At 9:00 AM on the 13th, they approached the coast with warships, and at 11:00 AM that day, they began minesweeping operations in the Manila Bay Strait north of Corregidor Island while carrying out intense bombing. The Japanese garrison on the island launched accurate fire under the enemy's heavy bombardment, resulting in the sinking of one enemy minesweeper. The strait remains secured by Japanese forces.

### Enemy Large Destroyer - One Sunk

Philippines Base, 15th (Central News Agency) - On the afternoon of February 9th, a Japanese submarine surrounded an enemy large destroyer near the Mindanao Sea, and after a sure-kill torpedo attack, sank it.

### Nimitz Has Announced Headquarters Established in Guam

Lisbon, 15th (Central News Agency) - US Pacific Fleet Commander Nimitz announced that the new headquarters is now located in Guam. After the announcement, an Associated Press frontline reporter said that the key points of moving the headquarters to the extremely dangerous Guam are as follows: Because many Japanese soldiers are still hiding on the island, there is always the possibility of sniper fire anytime and anywhere, so no area can be called a safe zone. The most dangerous areas are the sparsely populated dense forests, so the US military is making great efforts to sweep away these remaining Japanese forces.

### About Sixty Enemy Planes - Attacked Nagoya Yesterday - Results of Interception Under Investigation

Tokyo, 15th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced at 5:50 PM on the 15th: In the afternoon of the 15th, about sixty enemy aircraft, with the main force attacking Nagoya in two groups, raided Shizuoka and Mie Prefectures. The results of the interception are currently under investigation, and Japanese ground facilities suffered some damage.

Tokyo, 15th (Central News Agency) - About sixty enemy B-29 aircraft from the Mariana base raided the central region from 1:30 PM to a little after 3:00 PM on the 15th. Their main target was the Nagoya factory area, and a portion dropped bombs and incendiary bombs in and around the city, causing fires and some damage on the ground. The remaining small group of aircraft bombed Ujiyamada, resulting in considerable damage to the area, but the Ise Grand Shrine remained safe as usual. Subsequently, enemy aircraft also bombed in and around Hamamatsu, along the coast of Lake Hamana, and in Shizuoka, but the area suffered little damage. Judging from this raid, the enemy aircraft were all in small formations of ten or fewer aircraft, likely to avoid a repeat of the chaotic situation during previous large-scale raids when they were intercepted by Japanese aircraft and fled into the clouds. Their clumsy tactics have now been completely exposed, which suggests that the enemy will adopt a small-formation strategy in the future.

### American Casualties in Luzon Island Operations

Editorial

### Re-discussing the Three-Nation Conference

The conference of the three major anti-Axis powers, Roosevelt, Churchill, and Stalin, which began at the beginning of this month, was declared over on the 11th. This newspaper's editorial has already made a concise statement regarding the details of this conference, its possible content, and the contradictions and conspiracies among the three countries, and the development of the facts will probably not fall outside the scope of our discussion.

The place where the three heads gathered was Yalta in Crimea, near the Black Sea coast. Roosevelt and Churchill did not hesitate to make another long journey overseas to be enlightened by Stalin, which shows the importance of Stalin's position in the three-way talks. In reality, the Red military power is developing more rapidly and widely than that of Britain and the United States, and its political power has already far exceeded that of Britain and the United States. The Soviet Union's arrogance and Stalin's arrogance are not accidental.

However, although the Three Heads Conference has been declared over, apart from a vague so-called joint declaration issued on the 13th, no specific content has been published. The joint declaration seems to focus on military aspects and how to deal with the German question, but they are still being secretive about these matters. It is claimed that the three countries have agreed on closer joint military plans than before, but they will not be announced until they are implemented. It is also claimed that the three countries have decided on a plan for Germany's unconditional surrender, but it will not be announced until Germany is finally defeated. The joint declaration stated that they want to shorten the war time and coerce Germany to quickly surrender and pay compensation, which shows their anxiety about the further prolongation of the war and their ruthlessness towards Germany. However, as the German external spokesman stated: Germans would rather endure pain and sacrifice completely, and the Yalta communique will instead arouse Germans' psychology of hatred and enmity. Obviously, it is wishful thinking for Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union to expect Germany to surrender easily and end the war as soon as possible.

It is certain that the three heads have discussed international political issues from many aspects. However, they seem to be even more secretive about political issues. This is nothing more than: (1) They have various conspiracies with the goal of sacrificing the smaller countries and must maintain extreme secrecy; (2) They have many contradictions centered on the division of spheres of influence and need to carefully conceal them.

On the issues of Poland and France, the conspiracy of Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union to control the world and oppress the weak has already been clearly revealed. It is said that the Three Heads Conference has decided to reorganize the Polish government and establish a "Polish National Coalition Government". How to establish the government is entirely to be controlled by foreigners, which is not a thorough internal interference? The de Gaulle regime in France, which relies on British and American support and takes advantage of the contradictions between the United States and the Soviet Union to grow, has considerable ambitions. The French are still keen on squeezing into the position of a first-class country, but they have been suppressed by Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union. It is rumored that de Gaulle repeatedly requested to participate in the meeting before the conference, but was always excluded. All of this contains factors that will still make the future international situation turbulent and unstable.

As for the contradictions among Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union, especially the contradictions between Britain and the United States and the Soviet Union, even if they want to hide them, they are often exposed at any time and anywhere. Before the Yalta Conference, Roosevelt and Churchill first held talks on the island of Malta, and then flew together to meet Stalin, which also showed the subtle relationship between the three countries. Their contradictions cannot be resolved in a day or two. It is said that an "Anti-Axis Conference" will be held in San Francisco in mid-April, and all anti-Axis countries will be invited to participate. We can still predict that this future meeting will still not achieve anything.

### Japanese Air Force Bombs Thamadaw Airfield; Fierce Battles in the Irrawaddy River Basin

Burma Front, 15th (Central News Agency) - Japanese forces in the Irrawaddy River basin engaged in fierce battles with the enemy British Indian Army. The Japanese Air Force in Burma launched a fierce air raid on the enemy's crossing points and forces, military supplies, etc., near Chaung, about 20 kilometers east of Seikpyu, across from Kyoum on the Irrawaddy River, on the night of the 12th. Four warehouses were hit and caught fire, and ten military transport vehicles were destroyed. The entire Japanese Air Force safely returned.

Burma Front, 15th (Central News Agency) - The enemy air force stationed in India has established several airfields in the Northern Burma and Indo-Burma regions, which have been repeatedly attacked by the Japanese Air Force, thwarting their plans. On the 12th, the Air Force once again fiercely attacked the newly established Thamadaw airfield located 50 kilometers west of Kyaukse, destroying seven enemy aircraft and setting five on fire, and causing major damage to other military facilities. All Japanese aircraft returned safely.

### Minister Wu Talks about Strengthening Combat Power

Xinjing, 15th (Central News Agency) - The General Affairs Minister of the Manchurian State's Military Department recently spoke on the reallocation of industry among China, Japan, and Manchuria and related issues, stating: The reallocation of industry among China, Japan, and Manchuria must be based on a high degree of comprehensive perspective. Therefore, the Manchurian State's strategy for enhancing its combat power will also increase with this new concept, that is, in addition to undertaking the task of supplying raw materials for the war in the past, it must also work hard in the production of decisive weapons such as aircraft, so that resources can become front-line combat power. Regarding the implementation of the new concept, there are two methods: the establishment of new factories and the relocation of Japanese factories. It is currently being actively handled with the support of the Japanese government. In addition to factory technology for the import and construction of new industries, it is also expected that Japanese entrepreneurs will need to enter Manchuria in the future. To this end, except in special circumstances, efforts will be made to allow outstanding Japanese entrepreneurs to come to Manchuria freely, and like other enterprises in Manchuria, if their enterprises are in danger, the state will be responsible for providing assistance.

### Victory in the Defense at the Vistula Society; Soviet Army Attempts to Encircle Breslau

Berlin, 15th (Central News Agency) – Huitong News Agency: The German army on the Eastern Front has now amassed more troops and launched repeated counteroffensives. The battles in the entire area from Megrogo to Schnieidemühl in the central sector are still in the preparatory stage, involving troop deployments and the struggle for bridgeheads. The Soviet army can only launch further offensives after crossing the Warta River, but has not yet reached that stage. The Red Army is attempting to advance towards Danzig between Camin and Schwetz, aiming to break through the German Vistula defense line. In the past twenty-four hours, the German army has achieved a complete victory in the defensive battles in this area. The Soviet army in Lower Silesia believes it has completed preparations for an offensive, but its operations have not been as smooth as initially expected. General Konev is again attempting to cut off the garrison of Breslau at Steinau in the upper reaches of the Warta River, between Gans and Kostenblut, severing the last line of communication between Breslau and the west. Fierce battles are currently taking place along the route, and the next forty-eight hours will determine whether the goal of isolating Breslau can be achieved. The fighting west of Breslau in the past twenty-four hours has forced General Konev to redeploy his troops. The Soviet army has concentrated a large number of tanks and mechanized infantry in the Liegnitz-Jauer-Neumarkt area, and this deployment has affected the fighting on the Bober River, with parts of the Soviet army apparently withdrawing from that area. After the German army withdrew from Penig, the Soviet army's advance has reached the Queis River at several points, and only localized fighting is taking place in the Sagan area. The Soviet army is currently fiercely attacking the fortress of Glogau, as it directly blocks the motor road from the Warta River to Sagan and Liegnitz, and Cottbus.

Berlin, 15th (Central News Agency) – German News Agency: A German military spokesman announced at noon on Wednesday: Sagan in southern Silesia is still firmly held by the German army, and all Soviet attacks have been repelled by the German garrison.

Berlin, 15th (Central News Agency) – German News Agency: After the fall of Elbing in East Prussia, the Soviet army has begun to reorganize and replenish its heavily casualties assault units. The Red Army has also dispatched reinforcements to the lower reaches of the Nogat River, and the fighting in various areas of the Königsberg front has eased. The corridor along the coastal highway has been slightly expanded by the German army, and the advance of the Soviet tank army has been blocked in the fierce street fighting east of Stuthenen, where the center of the battle is located.

Berlin, 15th (Central News Agency) – German News Agency, citing qualified sources: The Russian Liberation Army is an independent unit, and its commander-in-chief, Lieutenant General Vlasov, has the power of discipline and appoints officers according to its military needs. The chief of staff of the army is General Trukhin.

Western Front Offensive Shows Signs of Fatigue

Berlin, 10th (Central News Agency) – Huitong News Agency: The large-scale offensive of the enemy on the Western Front has gradually shown signs of fatigue. The German army is putting up fierce resistance along the 300-kilometer front from Nijmegen to Trier. After breaking through the first line of defense, the Canadian army's attempt to break through the lower reaches of the Rhine River failed. Many British and Canadian troops were cut off and annihilated in this battle. The British Second Army and the US Ninth Army on the Meuse and Roer River front lines are preparing for a major offensive, while the US First and Third Armies are engaged in fierce fighting between the Eifel and Saar Rivers. The right wing of the British and American armies has suffered heavy casualties, and the German army is fighting for every inch of ground, with every crossing point being contested. The fighting in Prüm is extremely fierce, with the bunkers changing hands six times in twelve hours. The US army is attempting to break through the German defense line in the Eifel, and the battle for the fortification on the German-Luxembourg border is extremely fierce. The enemy has launched its fifth major offensive on Aachen in five days.

Berlin, 15th (Central News Agency) – German News Agency: A German military spokesman pointed out yesterday that the heavy flooding and melting snow in the various areas of the right wing of the Western Front have slowed down the large-scale offensive of the British and American armies against the German positions there. The current weather has turned the areas where the anti-Axis forces intend to launch a major offensive into swamps, and the German counteroffensives have also had a strong effect.

### Price Evaluation Council to Convene Deliberation Meeting Today to Approve Prices of Major Commodities

In order to suppress prices and stabilize people's livelihoods, the Municipal Economic Bureau, in accordance with the central government's regulations on price management, has taken emergency measures to strengthen the organizational structure of the existing Municipal Price Evaluation Council. Ten economic experts or impartial businessmen from this city, including Li Quanshi, Li Zufan, and Xu Yuanfang, have been selected as specialized committee members to study the city's market conditions, commodity cost calculations, and commodity types, in order to evaluate prices in a reasonable manner.

### Preventing Malpractice in China Railway Must Be Thoroughly Implemented

The rectification of discipline in China Railway has been underway for more than a year, and is a practical requirement of the entire Chinese population. However, recently, due to the insufficient number of train trips, the issue of train tickets has tended to encourage illegal behavior by China Railway employees. The China Railway authorities have indeed implemented countermeasures to prevent malpractice, but these countermeasures are not thorough enough, and even have an attitude of evading responsibility for this illegal behavior as "force majeure," which is regrettable. Moreover, the conscious or unconscious obstruction of rice procurement work by China Railway employees is particularly criticized by all parties. Because the relevant authorities believe that rice and airplanes and tanks are all weapons for carrying out the Greater East Asia War, they dispatched rice procurement teams and repeatedly requested the China Railway authorities to provide special convenience in purchasing tickets for workers traveling between the interior of Shanghai to buy rice. On the official identity certificate, it was clearly stated: "Please provide convenience regarding transportation and other matters." This was intended to remind China Railway employees to pay attention and to formally issue ticket application forms and reach an understanding with the China Railway authorities that those with application forms should be given priority in purchasing tickets. However, China Railway employees found it difficult to solicit tips from those with special identity certificates and special application forms, so they deliberately did not sell tickets under various pretexts, which hindered rice procurement work.

This fact has proven how China Railway employees use their authority to engage in corruption, which has angered the relevant authorities. The heads of China Railway headquarters and various on-site agencies are almost all Japanese, and they often claim that "illegal behavior is committed by Chinese people, which is unavoidable," which is suspected of shifting responsibility to Chinese people and failing to take full responsibility to resolutely implement rectification work. Recently, criticisms of "Where is the spirit of China Railway?" have been rampant in the market.

The call to promptly report China Railway employees who obstruct rice procurement work and resolutely execute them in the Shanghai Station square is something that the highest leaders of the company should reflect on, promptly implement emergency countermeasures, and also take countermeasures to eliminate the illegal behavior of general ticket sales.

Difficulties When Boarding

Mr. A said: Previously, the Kunshan Rice Association Office urgently needed to allocate procurement funds, so it sent an employee to Jiangsu Office and the relevant guiding authorities to raise about 6,000 yuan, intending to take the express train back to Kunshan. However, the Suzhou station staff deliberately made things difficult and ultimately prevented him from boarding the train. The farmers in Kunshan were waiting for cash payments, and delaying payment even for one day would have a negative impact on the work. Later, fortunately, Japanese soldiers understood that rice work was indeed very important, so he was able to return to Kunshan with the Japanese soldiers on a freight train. This kind of example is countless. Even a female guest who looks like a dancer, as long as she pays, can take the express train, while those with important public affairs are rejected outside the train. Are China Railway employees eating tickets instead of rice?

Application Thrown Back

Mr. B said: I am a procurement worker in Jiaxing. I came to Shanghai to negotiate official business and planned to return to Jiaxing after finishing. I arrived at the ticket office at 4:00 AM with a special application form and waited in line. When tickets were sold at 7:00 AM, the ticket seller looked at the application form and said: Do you want to buy a ticket with this? At that time, the people in front and behind me all bought tickets, but I was the only one who didn't. As a result, I had to wait until the next day to return. I hope that this kind of illegal China Railway employee will be executed by firing squad. (Translated from the Continental News on February 15)

### Ministry of Finance Revises Method for Escorting Cash

Regarding the transportation of banknotes by merchants and civilians, the Ministry of Finance previously stipulated that those with more than 100,000 yuan must apply to the ministry for a passport. However, due to the current high cost of living, soaring prices, and increased need for cash, there is naturally more transportation. In view of this, the Ministry of Finance has revised the provision in Article 2 of the original method for escorting cash, which required a passport for more than 100,000 yuan, to more than 300,000 yuan to meet the needs. It has been announced and will be implemented from February 16 of this year.

### Baojia Personnel Wear New Armbands

Regarding the armbands worn by Baojia personnel and all levels of leaders and members of the Self-Defense Corps in various districts under the jurisdiction of the Municipal Police Bureau, the style has been specified, the designated printing house has been assigned to supervise the production, and the districts are successively receiving them and adding prints for distribution. All old armbands from the various districts in the past, because they were prepared by each district, were of different standards, and even a Lianbao had prepared them individually. If they were not reorganized, there would be many malpractices. Therefore, the Municipal Police Bureau's Baojia Self-Defense Corps Headquarters decided that, starting this month, all old armbands of Baojia and self-defense personnel in the various districts will be prohibited from wearing, and must be collected and sent to the Corps Headquarters for cancellation. At the same time, new armbands will be worn starting from today.

### This Newspaper's Scholarship Fund: "Special Fundraising" Last Four Days

Ending Around the 20th of This Month, Spanning Eighty Days

This newspaper's "Special Fundraising Team," organized to raise funds for the eighth readers' scholarship fund, has been promoted since December 1st of last year. Thanks to the enthusiastic support of people from all walks of life in Shanghai, who have made various efforts, contributing both effort and money, though in different ways, their contributions to aiding impoverished students and reserving talent for the country are completely consistent. In particular, teachers and students from major primary and secondary schools have jointly raised funds and provided particularly generous support. This great spirit of courage to do good is not only admired by all of us at this newspaper, but also deeply appreciated by the 5,000 scholarship recipients, who are moved to tears! The current scholarship work is about to be completed, and approximately 36 million yuan in aid is needed. As of today, 31.2 million yuan in aid has been raised, leaving a shortfall of 4.8 million yuan. It is believed that the proceeds from the upcoming charity bazaar and the benefit performance of "Wealthy Floating Clouds" will be sufficient to cover the shortfall. Therefore, this newspaper has decided that the deadline for the "Special Fundraising" will be the 20th of this month. In these last four days, it is hoped that all parties who have already made contact or are in the process of carrying out fundraising procedures will quickly settle them and send the donations to this office, so that the process can be completed on schedule. Given the urgency of the current situation, this newspaper has decided that the scholarship fund should be managed on a receipts-and-disbursements basis, leaving no donations behind, so as not to cause any inconvenience. We believe that this is a perfect accomplishment, and that the merit of our readers is unparalleled!

Disciples of the Master Wen Collectively Donate to the Scholarship Fund

Yang Fusheng and six other brothers wrote in a letter: "Respected Sir, we have heard that our teacher, Master Lan, often used Mencius' words 'Yu thought that if there were any drowning in the world, it was as if he had drowned them; Ji thought that if there were any starving in the world, it was as if he had starved them,' as a lesson. In order to promote this spirit of serving society, we have specially formed the 'Wen's Disciples Rescue Out-of-School Team,' collecting 500,000 yuan in national currency to donate to your newspaper's scholarship fund, as a token of our humble intentions. We especially hope that fellow disciples of Master Wen will follow suit and contribute, hoping to encourage others. We are now presenting the funds, along with a list of names, and hope you will consider it."

### Song of Spring: Benefit Performance Imminent

The proceeds from the ticket sales, after deducting expenses, will be donated entirely to the scholarship fund. We believe your newspaper will be happy to support this. The drama includes stage design, makeup, performance, symphony orchestra accompaniment, Sun Jinshen, Liu Yiling, Mao Tiemin, and a dance ensemble choir participating in the singing, Huang Yongxi serving as conductor, and Chen Zhong and Zheng Chuanjian designing and choreographing the dances. This is a new sprout emerging in the spring. We only hope that more " " people will come to cherish and nurture it, so that it can bloom new flowers in our country's barren artistic field.
