### Northern Part of Shuri, Okinawa: No Change in the Battle Lines; Southern Region Under Constant Bombardment

Tokyo, 26th – Central News Agency: Currently preparing for the next attack. Since the 25th, locations where local forces are preparing to attack include Onaga on the east coast (approximately 4 kilometers east of Shuri), the battle lines from the northeast highlands to the south side of Gashiki, all the way to the north of Ginowan on the west coast. The enemy is using small boats to transport troops and supplies to the shore near Makiminato and Minatogawa to the west of Makiminato.

Nansei Islands Base, 26th – Central News Agency dispatch: Production on the 25th, mainly naval aircraft, totaling less than 300 aircraft. Also, the enemy ships around Okinawa Island seem to have decreased, but large ships are still constantly heading south. A war correspondent from Okinawa, writing from the Okinawa Torishima airfield on the 24th, said that after inspecting the Okinawa Island battle lines, U.S. Commander-in-Chief Nimitz met with reporters on the 24th and made a statement. The main points are as follows: When the war in Europe is over, he sincerely hopes to transfer troops from that theater to the Pacific as quickly as possible. Of course, assistance from aircraft will be welcome, but airfields must be built first. The Japanese forces on Okinawa still have considerable strength and are using clever tactics, especially the activities of Japanese suicide aircraft, which pose a considerable threat to U.S. ships. One or two of these aircraft attacking at night, braving gunfire, is truly impossible to defend against. It cannot be denied that the U.S. has suffered losses as a result.

Many U.S. Tanks Destroyed

Central News Agency report, according to foreign dispatches: A war correspondent from the New York Post, attached to the U.S. 27th Division on Okinawa Island, Byga, reported on April 20 on the war situation on Okinawa Island as follows: The U.S. 193rd Independent Tank Battalion, in cooperation with the New York Infantry Division, advanced with twenty medium tanks as the vanguard, braving Japanese gunfire, attempting to occupy Gashiki. However, operating on the left flank, their tanks were hit and unusable. Japanese artillery is very effective against tanks, destroying at least four tanks during the initial bombardment. U.S. soldiers advancing several hundred yards were swept by Japanese machine-gun fire. U.S. soldiers could not use the damaged tanks, which were all destroyed by the Japanese "tank destruction squads." All tanks abandoned on the battlefield were approached by Japanese demolition teams under cover of smoke and thoroughly destroyed. One Japanese soldier, carrying a hundred pounds of explosives, threw it under a U.S. tank, destroying it. The U.S. advance was thus forced to halt. I saw U.S. First Battalion cross a mountain, but its advance was extremely slow. The Japanese counteroffensive on Okinawa Island is fiercer than any battle in the Pacific theater.

### San Francisco Conference Opens the Day Before Yesterday

U.S. Secretary of State Stettinius gave the opening address, introducing President Truman, who delivered a welcome speech from Washington, lasting ten minutes. The first session was very brief, entirely speeches. The sole purpose of the conference is to draft a charter for collective action to ensure peace, which will be submitted to the Allied nations for approval.

### Minister Matsushima Elaborates on the Situation on Okinawa Island; Also Discusses the Situation of the Encirclement of Berlin

Minister Matsushima, from the Allied Japanese Fleet Press Department in China, met with reporters as usual yesterday afternoon. Present were Captain Matsumoto and many reporters from various newspapers. Minister Matsushima elaborated on the fierce fighting on Okinawa Island, with the Japanese air force attacking the U.S. forces day and night, causing unprecedented casualties. Finally, he also elaborated on the San Francisco Conference and the situation of Soviet forces encircling Berlin. The main points are recorded below:

Japanese Air Force Annihilates Enemy Day and Night

The Japanese army, navy, and air force on Okinawa Island are relentlessly attacking the enemy's mobile forces day after day in adverse weather. As a result, the enemy has suffered extremely severe blows. They are now planning to retreat from the vicinity of Okinawa Island to the Mariana Islands. This kind of retreat by the enemy is unprecedented. Although the extent of their losses has not been announced, it is certain that there will be considerable damage. More than 80% of the combat ships sunk and damaged are above. In order to replenish losses and rescue severely injured soldiers, the enemy is using a part of a special air force to replenish Okinawa Island, resulting in serious blows. The enemy ships around Okinawa Island used to cover the ground forces included about five to six battleships and about ten cruisers. This number is already much smaller than before. The Japanese air force is currently launching day and night annihilation attacks on these defeated enemy forces.

Great Difficulty for British and American Replenishments - The Japanese army's southern front on Okinawa Island is very strong. The extent of its strength can be seen from the mouth of Nimitz, the commander of the U.S. Pacific Fleet. He said: "The strong defense of the Japanese army in this area is stronger than anything ever seen in the Pacific, and it is the most ideal." At the same time, Nimitz also spoke highly of the amazing achievements of the Japanese special attack forces. He said that the die-hard attacks of the Japanese air force are a great threat to any warship, and there is no way to prevent the wonderful war in which the Japanese aircraft team carried out during the evening and in bad weather. If the target is hit, it will suffer serious damage. The war situation of Okinawa Island in the future will be closer and closer to the period when the enemy will be wiped out due to the battle results of the Japanese air force. The difficulty of replenishment in combat for the British and Americans is now becoming increasingly profound. According to the observation of a certain Soviet military expert, the difficulty of replenishment has exceeded the limit. At the same time, according to Australian Prime Minister Curtin, replenishment is extremely difficult due to problems in production.

Very Significant U.S. Casualties - The U.S. military in the Pacific has always been silent about the extent of the damage it has suffered and has not disclosed it. Recently, according to the U.S. Department of the Army, the total number of casualties of the U.S. military from the start of the Greater East Asia War to February of this year was 801,845, including 173,006 dead, 461,369 injured, and the rest missing. According to its Air Force Chief Arnold, the number of deaths and injuries transported by aircraft has reached 700,000. Another message revealed that approximately 30,000 to 40,000 people die or are injured and return to their country every month. According to these numbers, it can be seen that there are great errors in what the U.S. military has published. Just considering the attacks by the Japanese special attack forces, the damage suffered by the enemy is already very large. The number of deaths and injuries of the people on the ships that were sunk by the Japanese special attack forces must be considerable. It can be asserted that it is above 300,000. In the past, in order to suppress general public opinion, the United States often kept the results of the Japanese special attack forces secret and said that they were of no help to the war. Recently, it has been unable to conceal this and has gradually recognized the results of the Japanese special attack forces.

San Francisco Conference is Biased Towards Idealism - Regarding the latest news of the San Francisco Conference, U.S. President Truman's speech on the conference podium included a blessing to the conference and a eulogy to the late President Roosevelt. In addition, what Truman described was how to resolve disputes between countries, and that international cooperation should be sincere and cooperative. Looking at the means adopted by the United Kingdom and the United States after the changes in the international situation before the war and their claims on the final Pacific dominance, Truman's remarks were very contradictory. In short, this is a repeat of President Roosevelt's dream, gathering 43 small and weak countries and legally acknowledging the power advocated by the United Kingdom and the United States, that is, the belief of justice. Therefore, the Dutch representative has expressed opposition to this claim. Also, because of the issue of the participation of the Polish representatives, friction has occurred between the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union. Therefore, this so-called conference is almost the same as the past League of Nations, biased towards idealism and failing in reality.

Admire the Courageous Spirit of the German Army

Finally, Minister Matsushima talked about the European war situation, saying that the Soviet army had already surrounded Berlin and was advancing towards the central area. Other important locations such as Leipzig, Hamburg, and Bremen had gradually fallen into the Allied forces. The brave fighting of the German army made me feel the belief that justice is power, and I really admire it. It is wrong to think that the fall of Berlin means that the German army has collapsed. Assuming that Berlin falls, a part of the German army, those in the north, will conduct long-term guerrilla warfare in Norway, Czechoslovakia, and Bavaria. The Soviet army's encirclement of Berlin was advancing from the northeast and southeast, and it was said that it was approaching the Hürtgenwald station. Approximately three-quarters of the urban area has been surrounded. The Soviet troops surrounding Berlin are the Koniev and Chaikov armies, totaling approximately 3 million people, and are approximately 8,000 yards away from the Linden Boulevard and the government's concentrated area, but the German army's counterattack is unyielding, with every house and wall being fought for. By comparing the courageous fighting spirit of the German army defending Berlin with the various incredible atmospheres at the San Francisco Conference, I firmly believe that there will still be a wave of such signs in the future world history.

Truman's Broadcast Address

Truman made a sincere appeal to all delegates at the opening of the conference, urging them to forget personal interests and abide by principles, so that all mankind can benefit: "There has never been a conference in history that is more important or more necessary than today. You are attending the San Francisco Conference. I would like to express my welcome to you on behalf of all the people of the United States. If the brutality and destructive power of modern warfare are not prevented, all civilization will eventually perish. In the continuation of international disturbances, and between establishing a world organization to promote peace, we have an opportunity to make a choice. The purpose of this conference is not to draft a peace treaty. Our task is not to resolve special issues of territory, borders, nations, and reparations. The purpose of the conference is to concentrate all its efforts to build an organization that ensures peace. Justice is still the greatest force on earth. We can only submit to this great force. Mankind has long known that it can never live in isolation. This basic principle also applies to today's countries. We are not isolated in wartime, and we dare not be isolated in peacetime. "

Four Foreign Ministers Discuss Before the Meeting

Lisbon, 26th – Central News Agency dispatch – Reuter's news: The foreign ministers of the United Kingdom, the Republic of China, the United States, and the Soviet Union gathered to discuss at a hotel in San Francisco for the last time before the opening of the San Francisco Conference. British Foreign Secretary Eden, Republic of China Foreign Minister T.V. Soong, U.S. Secretary of State Stettinius, and Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov were all present.

The Polish Issue Cannot Be Resolved - Lisbon, 26th – Central News Agency dispatch – Associated Press news: When the U.S. Secretary of State arrived in San Francisco, he told other members of the U.S. delegation that after discussing the issue of Poland with British Foreign Secretary Eden and Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov, he was still unable to resolve the deadlock. The Associated Press said that the Soviet Union still seemed to insist on its demands.

Editorial

### Decisive Battle on Okinawa

The enemy, the United States, has been invading Okinawa Island since the 25th of last month when it started operations in Kerama Islands in Ryukyu Islands. A month has passed. During this period, the war became more and more fierce, and the future of the war is worthy of attention. According to the daily war reports, most of the enemy's original plans have been shattered by the Allied forces, and the Allied forces have achieved unexpected battle results in this battle.

From the enemy's strategy, it is clear that they are trying to capture the important air bases of the Ryukyu Islands centered on Okinawa Island in one fell swoop with the most elite mobile forces in the Pacific, and then seize air and sea control of the western part of the Japanese mainland, the northern part of Taiwan, and the East China Sea. It will damage Japan's transportation links with the South Seas and Manchuria, and form a strategic situation of encircling the Japanese mainland on three sides. Because the enemy's advance base for attacking the Japanese mainland has only three bases: Mariana, Philippines and the newly established Iwo Jima. However, Mariana is 2,000 kilometers to Tokyo, the Philippines is 2,900 kilometers to Tokyo, and Iwo Jima is also 1,200 kilometers to Tokyo. Except for the use of B-29 aircraft, they are not enough to serve as effective air raid bases against Japan, so they are eager to seize Okinawa Island and nearby bases one step further.

However, as far as the Okinawa war situation in the past month is concerned, the Japanese army's brave fighting has mostly broken the enemy's strategy. As the special essay of the Soviet News reported on the 18th of this month stated: "The U.S. military on Okinawa Island has been slowed down due to the recent more intense resistance of the Japanese army. Also, the British Pacific Fleet seems to be participating in the Okinawa operation. However, this battle took place in the war zone of Japanese naval and air force bases, so it is extremely favorable to the Japanese army. The main base of the Japanese fleet, Sasebo, is only 350 li away from Okinawa, while the distance from the Mariana Saipan cemetery to Okinawa exceeds 1,500 li. The Japanese side can dispatch land-based aircraft from Kyushu for urgent attacks, with extremely wide room. On the contrary, the anti-Axis forces can only use carrier-based aircraft in the occupied land-based bases outside the carrier-based aircraft in the war zone, but they still encounter the brave interception of the Japanese navy and air force."

In this decisive battle on Okinawa, the enemy completely attempted to rely on its troops and materials to achieve victory. However, under the fierce interception of the Allied forces, not only has the attempt to quickly resolve the battle been shattered, but most of the troops and materials they prepared have also been defeated or destroyed. From the enemy's landing on Okinawa to the 24th of this month, the Japanese army used a small number of soldiers to intercept the enemy's six divisions, persisted in a month of bloody battles, killed 14,000 enemy soldiers, destroyed 313 tanks and automatic trucks, and destroyed 44 artillery pieces. The enemy troops struggling on Okinawa Island now are like wounded beasts and will no longer be able to do anything.

The great results of the Japanese army on Okinawa Island will certainly be recorded forever in the world's war history. In the decisive battle on Okinawa, the enemy's mobile forces, which had a decisive significance, have also been forced to retreat recently. (According to a report issued by Onoda Reporting Team members on the 24th, published in the Mainland New News on the 26th), a dispatch from the Tokyo Allied Press on the 25th further reported that the enemy's offensive in Okinawa had been frustrated and the artillery fire from the warships had gradually decreased. Therefore, from a general point of view, the situation of the decisive battle on Okinawa has entered a stable stage. However, the enemy, the United States, is still willing to bet everything on a single throw, and future wars centered on the decisive battle on Okinawa are inevitable. How can we concentrate the full power of the 1 billion people in East Asia, encourage the special attack spirit of the Okinawa defenders, grasp the favorable situation of the decisive battle on Okinawa, and defeat the enemy, which is a task that cannot be ignored at present.

### Japanese Prime Minister Broadcast Last Night, Encouraging Okinawa Soldiers and Civilians to Launch a Unified Assault

Tokyo, 26th – Central News Agency dispatch: Japanese Prime Minister Suzuki broadcasted to the Japanese army and all officials and civilians on Okinawa Island at 7:45 PM on the 26th, mainly saying: "To all of you soldiers and all officials and civilians who are united in the entire war zone of Okinawa and fighting in a special attack spirit, our 100 million people are endlessly grateful for your brave fighting. I receive reports of destroying enemy aircraft every day, which makes our people very happy, but when I think of the magnificent posture of the special attack team breaking into enemy warships and the ground troops killing into the enemy's陣, I feel deeply indebted.

All soldiers and civilians on Okinawa Island, I am unworthy to receive the great order to organize the cabinet, and I have encountered the most serious difficulty since the founding of the country. I am determined to unite with 100 million people and fight to the end to achieve final victory, smash the ambitions of the enemy British and Americans, so as to pacify the holy heart. I expect you to bravely fight the enemy who broke into a corner of the mainland, and at the same time I am determined to take the lead and carry out a general assault under the banner of unified operation. Today, 100 million people are not afraid of being bombed every day, and they are echoing the soldiers on the front lines, engaging in strengthening combat power. Today, there is no distinction between the front and the rear. They are fighting as one for war and production. Considering that you are responsible for the rise and fall of the empire, I deeply expect you to grasp the divine opportunity to ask for victory. Our mainland people will also continue to fight when the time comes, and we will never be discouraged. "

### Air Raids on Kyushu and Shikoku, Battle Results Under Investigation, One Bomber Shot Down Over Taiwan

### Soviet War Report Announces, Encirclement of Berlin Completed, Hand-to-Hand Combat Unfolds in the Subway

Stockholm, Sweden, 26th (Central News Agency) - Reuter reports that, according to news from the press here this morning, Soviet forces have penetrated deep into the heart of Berlin, continuing to encounter strong German resistance, so the battle is becoming increasingly fierce. General Stalin issued a war report stating that the Red Army has completed the encirclement of Berlin.

### A Glimpse of New Huaihai (Part 1)

— Yifei

The newly established Huaihai Province has only a short history of one year and two months. With the cooperative efforts of officials and the people, its various departments have made rapid progress, with a feeling of advancing a thousand miles a day. Previously, this reporter has successively introduced the outlines of Huaihai Province. Now, I will report on the latest situation in Huaihai, item by item, as follows.

Huaihai Province was established on February 1st of last year, administering one city and twenty-one counties, divided into six administrative inspectorates, including five first-class counties, ten second-class counties, and six third-class counties. At that time, its area was 215,476 square li, and the number of districts, townships, and towns was 179 districts, with a total of 13,242 pao (units of 10 households), 102,787 jia (units of land), 1,205,471 households, and a total population of 7,081,736 people.

The statistics listed above have now changed. Recently, in addition to Xuzhou City, Haizhou City was established on March 1st. Also, Hao County, which was originally under its jurisdiction, was exchanged with Yongcheng County in Henan Province on February 1st. Furthermore, Funing County was officially transferred to the Northern Jiangsu Administrative Office on March 1st. Therefore, the current Huaihai Province actually administers two cities and twenty counties. Under the leadership of Governor Hao (concurrently the Pacification Commissioner stationed in Xuzhou), the National Army in Huaihai Province is constantly fighting against the Yu Army (communist) and bandits in the surrounding areas. With the smooth progress of the military, in addition to the original area, the area expanded in recent years is 161,607 square li. (This statistic is as of February, and continues to increase. For example, in mid-March, the seventh district of Tongshan County expanded to its important stronghold of Xuzhuang after a fierce battle with bandits.)

The number of districts, townships, and towns has also increased by 169 districts, and the total population has increased to over 13 million people. The expanded area is 75% compared to the original area.

### Public Security and Rural Clearance

The public security situation in Huaihai has been mentioned by this reporter in previous correspondence, and it is exceptionally stable. This phenomenon is by no means accidental. Huaihai is in a very difficult situation, constantly surrounded by enemies. Without an experienced and well-trained officer like Governor Hao to preside over it, it would be difficult to overcome such a harsh environment and make achievements. (Note: Hao graduated from the Artillery Department of Kiev University in the Soviet Union.) Hao's administration of the military combines benevolence and authority, with clear rewards and punishments. He also pays close attention to military training for the public. The police defense corps in Xuzhou City numbers in the tens of thousands, all energetic young people, practicing diligently every day, no different from soldiers, and can be called a strong force of the people under the decisive battle system. Also, students from Huaihai College, the Training Corps, the County Administration Personnel Training Institute, and the Police Training Institute (Note: these four are Huaihai's cadre education institutions) regularly conduct field marching exercises. Recently (early this month), they jointly marched in the Jiuli Mountains, no different from soldiers. Therefore, it can be seen that whether military or civilian, they are a powerful guarantee of Huaihai's public security.

Since strengthening its work in January of this year, the Huaihai Rural Clearance Bureau has been conducting thorough work in key counties and districts. In order to understand the real situation of public security in Huaihai, the Administrative Yuan Rural Clearance Bureau sent Section Chief Liang Chuanpu to Huaihai for inspection in early this month. According to Liang, he expressed his satisfaction afterwards.

The Huaihai authorities believe that the quality of the police is related to the promotion of national administration and the maintenance of public security. In order to improve the quality of police officers, they specially ordered Liu Xinghua, the Director of the Provincial Police Department, to re-administer the general examination for police officers in Huaihai counties on March 17th to screen them and improve police administration.

### District Prosecutor's Office Files an Appeal Against Wang Maoting

### Banks and Money Shops to Adopt Transfer Procedures for Clearing Checks

Recently, there has been a shortage of cash in the markets of various industries, and most transactions are replaced by post-dated checks and transfer slips. The payment of money and goods between banks and money shops to other banks and money shops and with regular customers has also been done this way, and the money shops also issue checks of the Union Bank's Cashier to the Union Bank Cashier as a way to transfer their balances. As a result, the number of checks issued to the Union Bank Cashier by the member companies of the Union has been increasing every day, reaching up to 20,000 or 30,000. The crowded and busy situation every day is almost the same as that of a closing account. According to financial industry sources, the Union Bank Cashier believes that the current method of handling ticket receipts and payments by the two industries will cause problems not only with time and manpower, but also greatly affect the revenue of clearing tickets for related industries. Therefore, the person in charge of the Union Bank Cashier has consulted several times and jointly agreed on four new methods of reciprocal ticketing to remedy the situation. It has been announced to various industry companies to start implementing from the first day of the next month.

### 19th Phase of Household Sugar, Supplementary Distribution for Insufficient Quantities, Purchase from Retail Stores with Receipt

The sales period for the 19th phase of household sugar ended on the 24th of this month. The Shanghai Sugar Merchants Cooperative Business Office stated that the sugar allocated for this phase was distributed according to the sales volume of the previous phase, so the sugar allocated to retailers was not sufficient to meet demand. It is understood that the quantity of household sugar allocated for each phase is requested from the relevant authorities based on the number of sugar coupons. However, after the end of the 18th phase of household sugar sales, the actual sales volume of each retailer averaged only 70%. Therefore, the relevant authorities, due to the decrease in sales volume, allocated the quantity of household sugar for this phase according to the actual sales volume of the 18th phase. However, the Cooperative Business Office was still concerned that the allocated sugar might be insufficient. After consultation with the authorities, they were approved for supplementary distribution. Therefore, they notified retailers that if the sugar for sale was sold out, they could first collect the sugar coupons and issue receipts, and report to the Cooperative Business Office after the end of the sales period for supplementary distribution based on the receipts. Now that the sales period has expired, the Cooperative Business Office is processing the supplementary distribution. Once the procedures are complete, they will publish an announcement in the newspaper. At that time, consumers can purchase from the retail stores with the receipts made by the retail stores for receiving sugar tickets. The spokesperson of the Cooperative Business Office said: "In the future, it is hoped that consumers will purchase household sugar on time according to the schedule, and not arbitrarily choose to accept or reject the allocated sugar due to temporary fluctuations in market prices, so as to avoid the same situation from happening again."

### Grand Xing Park Annual Passes Valid for the Bund Park

The Municipal Construction Bureau has now provided a proper solution. All holders of annual passes for that park can use their passes to enter and visit the Bund Park during the period that Grand Xing Park is closed.

### Municipal Finance Bureau to Impose Double Penalties for Late Payment of License Fees

Since the Municipal Finance Bureau implemented the adjustment of various business vehicle and housing sublease license fee rates, tax revenue has increased significantly. However, the number of those who have not paid their license fees after the collection period is quite large. For example, the spring business license fee expired at the end of March this year, but there are still a few businesses that have not paid the fees. Many people have not paid the housing sublease license fee for the first half of the 34th year of the Republic, and some have not even applied for a housing tax license. This situation has a significant impact on the income of the municipal treasury. Therefore, in order to recover overdue housing taxes and deal with those who delay paying taxes, the Bureau has decided to impose severe penalties on such businesses and people. Once the rules and regulations are drafted, approved, and announced, they will be implemented in the near future. The penalties will be doubled compared to before.

### Unified Handling of Tax Smuggling

In order to strengthen the work of tax anti-smuggling, the Taxation Administration of the Ministry of Finance has transferred the work of investigating and cracking down on smuggling of consolidated taxes and special taxes in all districts of Shanghai to the Anti-Smuggling Task Force of the Taxation Administration. It is learned that after receiving the order, the Shanghai First, Second, Third, Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, and Seventh Inspection Offices, and the Wusong Inspection Office, have been ordered to uniformly abolish their existence by the 30th of this month. Starting from May 1st of this year, matters such as declaration and inspection of import, export, and transit consolidated taxes, temporary special taxes, mineral taxes, and tobacco and alcohol taxes will still be handled directly at the Taxation Administration at 200 Jiujiang Road. It is heard that the Anti-Smuggling Task Force of the Taxation Administration has established the Shanghai East Dispatch Team and the Shanghai West Dispatch Team to be responsible for investigating and cracking down on all smuggling and tax evasion tasks in Shanghai East and Shanghai West (including the North District). The task of anti-smuggling in Shanghai South is being supervised and carried out by the Task Force.

### Four Theaters Punished for Failing to Pay Fines on Time

In order to regulate the performances of various theaters and prevent them from violating military rules, the Municipal Propaganda Office regularly sends personnel to investigate the performance licenses. Twelve theaters, including the Tongshang Theater, have been fined for operating without a license. Among them, the Tongshang, Hebei, Jinguo, and Imperial Palace Theaters have not paid their fines on time. The Office has sent letters to the police station to order the sub-bureaus in charge to suspend their performances for three days, as a warning and to collect the fines.

### Street Poster Advertisement Requires Permit Application

The Municipal Construction Bureau states that according to regulations, street poster advertisements must be submitted to the Bureau's Second Section for stamping and to obtain a permit in advance. However, recently, many merchants and citizens have been posting them without authorization, which violates regulations and needs to be corrected. Therefore, from now on, all merchants and citizens who need to post such advertisements must submit all advertisements to the Bureau for stamping and obtain a permit; otherwise, they will be strictly dealt with once discovered.

### Yuzhai Master Initiates Establishment of Loan Fund for Hidden Poverty

A letter from the Master of Yuzhai states: "I have recently received letters from many people in hidden poverty requesting assistance, several every day. After conducting a personal investigation, I found that their families have elderly members suffering from illness and children with malnourished complexions. They eat porridge made from corn flour and beans, or have been without food for a long time, buying pancakes and fried dough sticks from the street to fill their stomachs, or eating only once a day, or only one meal every other day. What is even more surprising is that most families in hidden poverty have elderly parents above them and many children below them, so the number of mouths to feed is overwhelming. Considering that Shanghai is a vast and densely populated city, the number of hidden poor people who have no way to report their plight must be large. If they are not given direct relief quickly, they will all become starving corpses. Therefore, I have initiated the establishment of a 'Loan Fund for Hidden Poverty,' entrusting 15 million yuan to the Zun Sheng Shan Hui [Respect Saints and Benevolence Association] and 5 million yuan to the Ningbo Shanghai Fellow Townsmen Association, totaling 20 million yuan, as a first step. I deeply hope that powerful people from all walks of life and various fellow townsmen associations will follow suit."

Loan Fund Regulations

The total amount of the loan fund is 15 million yuan from the Zun Sheng Shan Hui and 5 million yuan from the Ningbo Shanghai Fellow Townsmen Association, totaling 20 million yuan.

Anyone who is in hidden poverty and truly in hardship may submit a letter in the name of the head of the household to the Zun Sheng Shan Hui at 180 Bubai Road [French Avenue Pétain], and fellow townsmen from Ningbo may apply directly to the Ningbo Fellow Townsmen Association on Xizang Road [Tibet Road].

Applicants must provide detailed information on their personal history, family situation, communication address, and the purpose of the loan.

The amount of the loan per household will be determined after the total number of applicants has been investigated and statistically analyzed (the estimated amount per household is approximately 20,000 to 100,000 yuan).

This loan is interest-free and has no fixed repayment date. Borrowers may repay the loan when their financial situation improves.

Application deadline: The end of April for the Ningbo Fellow Townsmen Association, and May 5th for the Zun Sheng Shan Hui. Applications will not be accepted after the deadline.

### Donate Charity School Fund in Remembrance of Deceased's Wishes

A letter from Xu Tianjue Tang states: "Our late mother, Madam Xu, née Xu, loved children by nature. Before she reached adulthood, she would share snacks she received with the children in the neighborhood, happily. After middle age, she treated the younger generations of relatives and friends as her own. A neighbor had a girl who was learning to speak, and when others held her, she would cry. When our late mother held her from behind, she would laugh out loud. Also, when her older sister had her feet bound, she cried morning and night. Our late mother couldn't bear it, so she took care of it, not too tight and not too loose, so that she could move as usual, and the girl stopped crying and laughed. Therefore, all the children admired her. In her later years, she longed for grandchildren very much. Bored during the long days, she always amused herself with dominoes. After she had a granddaughter, she took care of her personally in every way, from hunger and fullness to cold and heat. The dominoes were then put aside and ignored. Her love was like this. This year, on the eighth day of the fourth lunar month, which would have been her 100th birthday, in accordance with the principle of thrift, we will not be extravagant and will not trouble relatives and friends. We respectfully donate savings bonds worth 40,000 yuan to your newspaper's charity elementary school fund, to fulfill the wishes of our late mother. We hope that you will accept them."
