### Marshall to Arrive in China to Assume New Post; Repeated Meetings with Truman and Byrnes in Recent Days; Hurley Has Gone to Jingji Mountain for Recuperation

[Central News Agency, Washington, 28th Dispatch] Marshal Marshall met with President Truman and Byrnes twice today at the White House to discuss his mission to China, but the content remains secret. It is expected that further meetings will be held tomorrow morning. Current indications suggest that he will depart for China before the weekend.

[Further Dispatch] According to U.S. official sources, if transportation arrangements are complete, Marshal Marshall may fly to Chongqing by special plane tomorrow. However, the names of accompanying personnel have not yet been disclosed. It is currently hoped that he can arrive in Chongqing before the end of next week.

[Further Dispatch] U.S. Secretary of State Byrnes stated before the end of a press conference that he would visit Marshal Marshall again this afternoon to discuss the current situation in detail. Byrnes also said that Marshal Marshall's mission to China will receive his unconditional support.

[Central News Agency, Washington, 28th, United Press Dispatch] Chairman of the Pearl Harbor Incident Investigation Committee, Barkley, stated that Marshal Marshall will be invited to testify before his departure for China, but the date has not been determined.

[United Press, Washington, 29th Dispatch] The new U.S. Ambassador to China, General Marshall, is being given broad authority and is hurriedly preparing to depart for China. His predecessor, Major General Hurley, after resigning, has already left for Jingji Mountain for recuperation. Chairman of the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Connally, told reporters that he intends to have Hurley and Secretary of State Byrnes attend a closed-door Senate meeting on Monday to informally discuss Hurley's claim that he was opposed by the State Department and Chongqing subordinates during his tenure as ambassador to China, but does not intend to thoroughly investigate the matter, as requested by Republican Senator Wheeler. It appears that General Marshall will depart for Chongqing today to assume his new post.

[United Press, Chongqing, 29th Dispatch] The selection of Marshal Marshall, a highly respected international figure, by U.S. President Truman as a special ambassador to China has made a deep impression on the Chinese side here, who believe that Marshall's main purpose will be to study the Chinese military situation, especially as it relates to the international situation. After Marshall's investigation, if he supports the proposal of the U.S. military remaining in China to await the repatriation of Japanese troops, it could reduce agitation from the Chinese side demanding the immediate withdrawal of U.S. troops. According to proponents of this view, if U.S. troops withdraw abruptly, the chaos in China will be ten times greater than it is today, and the partitioned situation will in essence become even more extensive. Marshal Marshall's report to President Truman will be used as a basis for clearly defining a far-reaching and unwavering U.S. policy toward China.

[United Press, Chongqing, 28th Dispatch] The news of Marshall's appointment has overshadowed the news of Hurley's resignation. People in Chongqing generally acknowledge the seriousness of the situation here and feel that General Marshall will be able to make a decisive decision regarding the presence or departure of U.S. troops in North China. Many foreigners in Chongqing view Marshall's mission as clarifying to all relevant parties that the United States is extremely concerned about China's future and will never endorse any attempts to establish separate governments in the Northeast provinces, Inner Mongolia, or Xinjiang. This appointment further proves the importance and seriousness of the Chinese situation. Generally, people share this view and everyone says that the United States intends to support the Nine-Power Treaty guaranteeing China's sovereignty and independence, which has been fully demonstrated.

### Truman Selects Marshall Primarily for Military Issues

[Central News Agency, New York, 27th Dispatch] It is still difficult to know exactly what policy Marshall should implement in China, but Marshall enjoys a high reputation both internationally and domestically, has a deep friendship with Truman, and is highly trusted by him. In this regard, Marshall has an advantage over Hurley. President Truman's appointment of Marshall, who has spent his entire life in military service, as a special envoy indicates that the United States believes that the current problem facing the United States in China is primarily a military problem. As Marshall has the great reputation of a military statesman, he is most qualified to help solve this problem. After Marshall arrives in China, he will be able to provide General Wedemeyer with great spiritual support and policy guidance, as General Wedemeyer was a capable subordinate of Marshall when he was in the War Department. Marshall's appointment as special envoy to China will be widely supported in the United States. U.S. Newsweek stated that Secretary of State Byrnes is very busy today holding talks with the Army Department and the Navy Department regarding U.S. policy toward China. Marshall has already met Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, as they met during the Cairo Conference. From Marshall's recent report, which provided a detailed analysis of the Chinese situation, it can be seen that he is very familiar with China's military problems. Therefore, his mission to China has great significance for the future development of Sino-U.S. relations.

Further Dispatch: Marshall will celebrate his 65th birthday next month, but he is still like a good soldier. After retiring for a week, he was asked by President Truman to serve as his special envoy to China and immediately agreed without hesitation. According to those familiar with Marshal Marshall, one of Marshall's most prominent qualities is that he has only one goal: the national interest. It is said that Marshal Marshall is not interested in politics or fond of wealth and vanity. The Marshal does not have the bad habit of being arbitrary; he only values hard work and dislikes any mixed matters. He is kind by nature but also has a strict military efficiency mindset with high expectations. He has confidence but also humor and is full of wisdom. He values discipline, speaks in a low and fast voice, and has an excellent memory. He can strongly remember various facts and often speaks about military details and figures without notes. During his five years as Chief of Staff of the Army, Marshal Marshall maintained an excellent relationship with Congress and earned its trust and respect.

### Byrnes Tells Reporters U.S. Policy Toward China Remains Unchanged; Both Houses Demand Investigation of U.S. Diplomatic Personnel

[Reuters, Washington, 29th Dispatch] Secretary of State Byrnes, on the 28th, told reporters that U.S. policy toward China remains unchanged, and said that he had spoken with President Truman and General Marshall for about an hour today. When Marshall will depart for China has not yet been decided.

[U.S. Information Service, Washington, 28th Dispatch] Members of both houses of Congress today unanimously demanded an investigation of U.S. foreign policy and diplomatic personnel.

[Central News Agency, Washington, 27th Dispatch] Hurley's criticism of the State Department is unprecedented in American history. Although he did not name names, it was clearly aimed at figures in the State Department's Far Eastern Division and China Division. It is said that after the ambassador purged pro-Communist elements from his embassy in China, these two divisions continued to obstruct the reports that the ambassador sent to the U.S. government from China.

U.S. State Department Announces List of Career Diplomats

[Central News Agency, Washington, 28th, United Press Dispatch] The U.S. State Department announced that after Ambassador Hurley arrived at his post, there were a total of ten career diplomats in the U.S. Embassy in China. Byrnes pointed out that Acheson, currently a political advisor to MacArthur, and his assistant Schoenfeld, as well as three others currently serving in the State Department's China Division, namely John Carter Vincent (Deputy Director), Rheinhardt, and Drumright. Others include Smith, First Secretary of the U.S. Embassy in the Soviet Union, Davis, Second Secretary, Loudon, currently employed by the State Department, and Sprouse, currently the U.S. Consul in Kunming, and Heintzleman, the U.S. Consul in Shanghai.

[Reuters, Washington, 29th Dispatch] After Hurley issued his resignation statement, Republican leader Senator Wheeler stated that the actions of some of the diplomatic personnel Hurley accused were close to treason. He will propose a motion to establish a special committee of five to thoroughly examine the activities, administration, and service personnel of the State Department, and in particular, to investigate the extent to which State Department officials "sympathize with communist theory."

[Central News Agency, Washington, 28th, United Press Dispatch] Republican Congressman Curtis demanded that the Secretary of State "remove all communists and near-communist elements in the State Department."

[United Press, Dallas, 29th Dispatch] Former commander of the China Theater Air Force, Major General Chennault, stated that the certain permanent diplomats that Hurley referred to who interfered with American policy should be handed over to civil courts for trial.

[United Press, Tokyo, 29th Dispatch] MacArthur's political advisor, Acheson, who previously served in the U.S. Embassy in Chongqing, reportedly has no comment on Hurley's accusations, but he feels honored that General Marshall is now entering the diplomatic world.

Hurley Publicly Announces He Helped Facilitate Sino-Soviet Treaty

[U.S. Information Service, Washington, 28th Dispatch] Hurley announced today that the policy announced by the United States, namely unifying all anti-Japanese forces in China and supporting the Chinese people's hope for a "free, unified, and democratic government," is "undoubtedly" supported by the British and Soviet governments. He also stated that this policy has been opposed and undermined by certain American diplomats and "imperialist civil servants" from Britain, France, and the Netherlands in Asia.

[United Press, Washington, 28th Dispatch] After resigning as ambassador to China, Hurley gave his first public speech today at the National Press Club here, saying that the Sino-Soviet rapprochement that led to the signing of a treaty this summer was facilitated by him. "The Soviet Union has always said that the Chinese Communist Party is not actually a communist party," and the Soviet Union has not supported the CCP. According to Hurley, the Soviet Union supports the Chinese National Government and the leadership of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek and strongly stated that the Soviet Union is willing to establish closer and more amicable relations with China.

[United Press, Washington, 29th Dispatch] Hurley recently stated that he currently has no political ambitions and has not discussed with anyone whether he will participate in the presidential race in 1948.

British Parliament and Press Concerned About Situation in China

[Central News Agency, London, 27th Dispatch] The British Parliament and the press are extremely concerned about the situation in China due to Hurley's sudden resignation. During today's House of Commons meeting, questions were also raised about the situation in China. Member of Parliament Osborne asked Foreign Secretary Bevin whether the British government, in view of the current situation in China and the significant impact on British trade interests with China, has made any statement on the matter. Bevin replied that the British government believes that this is an internal matter that needs to be resolved by China itself, and at the same time, he hopes that the Chinese problem can be resolved.

[United Press, London, 28th Dispatch] London newspapers have adopted a rather calm attitude toward the resignation of U.S. Ambassador to China Hurley.

### National Army Enters Jin County; Residents Cheer in the Streets, Asking About Chairman's Well-being

[United Press, Beiping, 29th Dispatch] It is reported that the National Army is heading straight for Shenyang and is now less than 300 li from the city walls.

[Central News Agency, Jin County, 28th Dispatch] The National Army advanced to Jin County on the 26th, capturing over 100 aircraft and countless supplies. It is said that more than 70 of the aircraft are still in good working order. When the National Army entered the city of Jin County, residents cheered in the streets, and the whole city looked up to the National Army's majesty. Many elderly people were moved to tears, repeatedly asking about Chairman Chiang's well-being. The three major bridges over the Xiaoling River between Jinxi and Jin County were all destroyed by the Communist army and are currently being repaired. The mayor of Jin County has been replaced by Han [ ] appointed by the central government, who entered Jin County at 5:00 AM on the 26th to make all arrangements.

[United Press, Chongqing, 29th Dispatch] It is reported that the National Army has temporarily stopped advancing due to the peaceful entry of the Soviet Union, especially, into Shenyang, and is engaged in clearing the defense zone between Shanhaiguan and Goubangzi. It is also reported that the Communist army has retreated into the Dahushan area, 75 li northeast of Goubangzi.

### Editorial: An Analysis of Economic Policy

— Many Doubts Have Been Swept Away

How to carry out post-war economic construction has been the subject of many doubts in society: Is it liberalism? Or a planned economy? If control is implemented, to what extent will it be controlled? Regarding the series of issues of prices, finance, and exchange rates, should a laissez-faire attitude be adopted? Or should effective measures be taken quickly? Since the end of the war, there have been many unreasonable and uneconomical phenomena. What is the central government's attitude toward these issues?

Since the Chairman and President Song successively announced our economic policies at the first Supreme Economic Council meeting, these doubts can be said to have been swept away.

First, the question of control: The Chairman announced: "In order to further encourage large-scale industrial production, the various controls imposed by the government on industry during the war should be lifted immediately, unless, under certain circumstances, the lifting of controls would affect the overall national economy, which may be considered an exception." President Song also said: "The businesses operated by the government must have sufficient reasons for state ownership, otherwise, the result will not only increase unnecessary burdens on the national treasury, but also threaten the stability of finance and currency." Therefore, although the establishment of the China Textile Construction Company was recently announced, its term is only set for two years. President Weng Wenhao also explained that this is only a temporary expedient, and the government has no intention of competing with the people for profit. From this perspective, the scope of state-owned enterprises is severely limited by the government. Unless there is sufficient reason, all other businesses will still be based on private operation. Moreover, the government is willing to provide substantial assistance and guidance to private enterprises, as long as industrial and commercial enterprises do not rely entirely on the government and have a sufficient foundation and conditions.

Second, the foreign exchange issue: The Chairman stated: "The most urgent task is to determine the exchange rate to stabilize the currency, which must be done as soon as possible." President Song also said: "In terms of commerce, we should find ways to make everything related to international trade and international exchange mutually beneficial." It can be seen that the exchange rate will be determined as soon as possible, so that future international payments and international trade will be reasonably adjusted by the government, and will not return to the scattered state of the past.

Third, economic focus: Is the emphasis on agriculture? Or on agriculture, industry, and commerce equally? This is also one of the issues that people speculate about. According to the speeches of the Chairman and President Song, they are entirely based on the principles of the Kuomintang's people's politics, emphasizing agriculture, industry, and commerce equally, and sparing no effort to provide multifaceted assistance to ensure their balanced development, with the ultimate ideal of enabling the people to generally obtain employment and a higher standard of living.

Fourth, the issue of post-war recovery: Due to various reasons, the situation regarding acceptance and resumption of work in various aspects has not been satisfactory. The central government is also very clear about this, but the Chairman said: "This situation cannot be allowed to drag on. Our first task must be to enable the people to regain employment." President Song also said: "We must embrace a spirit of fearlessness to overcome these difficulties so that the economic construction policy can be thoroughly realized." Then, after the improvement and rectification, it is believed that there will be thorough and rapid measures, and for the previously unavoidable slow and corrupt habits, and the selfish and self-serving dregs, will also be severely punished, cleared away, so that the people can get some comfort.

The above points are of the greatest concern to the public, so they are specifically mentioned. In passing, a few words should be added: (1) Since the government's policy does not adopt a strict state-owned policy, and in order to reduce the heavy burden on the national treasury, it tries to avoid direct operation, then those businesses that have been taken over by various regions and agencies to date should be opened up to private operation as soon as possible if there is no sufficient reason, or initially support private operation, without seeking to be developed individually by the government, resulting in suspicions of competing with the people for profit. (2) The foreign exchange issue is closely related to prices, currency, finance, and even the lives of the general public. It is hoped that a decision will be made as soon as possible so that people's livelihoods can be stabilized and industry and commerce can be smoothly developed. (3) It is not easy to clearly distinguish economic issues from political issues. Obviously, most of the obstacles now are due to the lack of security and smooth transportation. It is hoped that the government and the public can put the national interest first, automatically restrain and cherish each other, so that the entire national economy can be revived as soon as possible. And at this time when the people are eagerly hoping for governance, it is hoped that the government will invigorate and rectify the situation, accelerate the work of pacifying and clearing the countryside, and never excessively tolerate all acts of violence that endanger the foundation of the country and disturb the people's livelihood. It must be known that tolerance can condone evil, and the suffering of the people is caused by the government's excessive tolerance that cannot be relieved, which is truly upsetting. "Escaping from fire and water and ascending to a seat of ease" is what is hoped of the government.

### Returning from the Northwest 3

— Fang Canglang

The Xi'an-Lanzhou Highway is the Northwest's major artery, spanning Shaanxi and Gansu provinces. It's over 700 kilometers in total, and currently there are scheduled buses running in both directions every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. Because gasoline in the Northwest is very cheap, with an official price of only 300 yuan per gallon, fares are also cheap, with the full journey costing only 4,700 yuan. Although the schedule is accurate, it's impossible to say when a bus that has already departed will arrive.

Pingliang is an important town in eastern Gansu, located 200 li north of Qingyang (originally part of Gansu's Third Administrative Region, now occupied by the Communists), the forward position in northern Shaanxi; it is also no more than a two-day journey from the border of Ningxia Province to the south. It is a crossroads where fabrics and cotton yarn from the east, furs and medicinal materials from the west, and 'black beauties' from the north or 'poppy paste' from the south, all rest in Pingliang. The former has continued to prosper since the victory, while the latter has slightly diminished its traces amidst the calls for reform in Gansu. According to Commissioner Guo Pei of Pingliang, public security in eastern Gansu has improved, but while the bandits in the mountains have been eliminated, the "bandits in the heart" still need to be purged. Those political tricksters and local bullies who rely on 'black beauties' for enjoyment, as well as corruption, are all stumbling blocks to the future of the prohibition policy. This is a small problem within the Northwest question, and the answer to solving this problem is "achieving unification."

Each of the Northwest provinces has its own unique characteristics. During my trip to eastern Gansu, I surveyed the prices of goods in the Jingning and Pingliang area and found them surprisingly low. Pingliang is a large city. Rice sells for only 3,200 yuan per 100 catties, pork for 80 yuan per catty, lard for 140 yuan per catty, and hens for 70 yuan per catty. Jingning is more than 25% cheaper than Pingliang. I carefully studied the reasons for the low prices in eastern Gansu and found that it was due to the following factors: 1. public security is not a concern; 2. urban and rural traffic is unimpeded; 3. no tax on simple meals; 4. no excessive taxes and levies; 5. reasonable and pragmatic price controls; 6. officials abide by the law; 7. merchants and the public fear the law; 8. simple living; 9. hotels and restaurants do not add 20% or 100% service charges. The prices in eastern Gansu are so cheap, and the travelers in our bus feel unusually relaxed.

Road Demolition Army

I arrived in Xi'an on the 15th. The first difficulty after getting off the bus was finding a hotel. Xi'an, during the demobilization period, appeared even more prosperous and bustling. The cost of living is one and a half times higher than in Pingliang. Cigarettes are cheaper, but fish is the most expensive, with a 3-catty carp selling for at least 8,000 yuan. It is said that the victory firecrackers in Xi'an brought down one bank, two money shops, and nine gold shops. The biggest loser was a commercial bank that specialized in hoarding large quantities of cotton. Officials, merchants, and refugees running from Shaanxi, Gansu, and other places to North China or Northeast China gathered in Xi'an, expecting assistance. As a result, the commercial situation reported in the newspapers was unusually lively. Regarding transportation, the Longhai Railway now extends west to Baoji and east to Mianchi Town.

Mianchi Town belongs to Mianchi County on the edge of western Henan. Passenger cars leaving Xi'an to the east pass through Weinan, Huaxian, Huayin, and Tongguan, stopping at Mianchi. The most severely damaged section of the western Longhai Railway is the Lingbao Bridge and tunnels east of Mianchi. According to the person in charge of the Longhai Railway Bureau, repairing this section alone will take at least half a year. Mianchi Town and Luoyang are served by the Yu-Shaanxi Joint Transportation Office, with one to three passenger cars running daily in each direction. The highway mileage between Mianchi and Luoyang is only 235 kilometers, and the passenger fare is only 9 yuan per kilometer. This is a wise measure taken by the government to facilitate demobilization, transport refugees back to their hometowns, and strengthen transportation between Shaanxi and Henan. This Joint Transportation Office is directly under the wartime Transportation Administration. The director is named Zhou Yanjun, and the staff are all young people. The drivers are specially selected middle-aged men with skilled techniques and mild personalities. Therefore, malpractices and unfortunate events such as selling black market tickets, privately carrying contraband, rollovers, and crashes have been rare since the Yu-Shaanxi Joint Transportation Office began operations.

Travelers returning east from Xi'an or taking the route through Zhengzhou to the north and south of the Beijing-Hankou Railway, breathe a deep sigh of relief when they reach Zhengzhou, thinking that they can finally escape hardship and take the train. But good things often face setbacks, and troubles arise within the family. Suddenly, the "Road Demolition Army" appears.

The masterpiece of the "Road Demolition Army" is to destroy transportation. They destroy the Xinxiang-Puyang Railway, and the Beijing-Hankou Railway is plagued by hemiplegia. The train heading north from Zhengzhou can only reach Xinxiang. The repair work of 107 kilometers from Xinxiang to Zhangde requires armed protection. Therefore, the road construction workers shoulder guns and start a battle for the road. The passenger car heading east on the Longhai Railway first departs from Zhengzhou to Zhongmu. Passengers cross the Yellow River flood area to the east bank, then change cars to Kaifeng. Zhengzhou and Kaifeng are a little less than 140 li apart, but due to the slow pace of the car and wide river, it also takes a lot of time. It is currently impossible to take a train from Kaifeng to Xuzhou because, on the eve of the near completion of the restoration of the Huangkou Station (November 5th), the Road Demolition Army was also discovered in Minquan, 79 li away from Kaifeng. Woe to those thousands upon thousands of refugees surging like tides, from the Longhai to the Beijing-Hankou, hearing that the Beijing-Hankou northern road is impassable, they returned to the Longhai, wandering around, eating everything they had, and with great difficulty reached Kaifeng, but unexpectedly, the road east was also destroyed. Most of the refugees are illiterate, but they believe in realism. The government hurried to establish the Yu-Shaanxi Joint Transportation at Mianchi Town, giving them cheaper rides on the better cars used by the Japanese army, so that they could return to their hometowns as soon as possible and avoid freezing and starvation. They felt warm and received practical benefits, so they praised the government and were grateful to the government. After they set off, they arrived in Zhengzhou and found that the Road Demolition Army was demolishing roads everywhere, making it difficult for them to travel and difficult to return home. In the northwest wind, they took off their cotton clothes, and even the cotton clothes of their children, took out the only quilt they had, and knelt in the open space in front of the station, selling it at a very low price to maintain a low level of life eating pancakes and drinking millet porridge, waiting for the resumption of traffic to beg for a living to go home. How miserable is this scene? The cruel reality teaches the poor masses the lessons of realism. What do the one million refugees stranded in the Central Plains think? (End)

### Wedemeyer Visits President Song to Discuss the Transfer of Surplus Equipment in West China, Denies Transfer of 700 Aircraft

[Chongqing, Central News Agency, 29th] General Wedemeyer, accompanied by Vice Admiral Barbey, commander of the U.S. Seventh Fleet, arrived in Chongqing on the 27th. He paid a visit to President Chiang Kai-shek on the evening of the 27th. On the morning of the 29th, Wedemeyer visited President Song to discuss the transfer of surplus U.S. military equipment in West China. General Wedemeyer held a press conference on the morning of the 29th, with Vice Admiral Barbey also in attendance. The questions and answers are recorded as follows:

Question: Has Marshal Marshall's mission to China changed the U.S. military policy in China?

Answer: Marshal Marshall's mission to China is to assess the general situation in China in order to provide a reference for U.S. aid to China and U.S. military policy in China. Marshal Marshall is highly respected and has extensive international knowledge and experience in handling international issues. Few people in the United States can compare with him. His mission to China will undoubtedly receive the support of the U.S. President, Congress, and the people.

Question: Is your trip to Chongqing to prepare for Marshal Marshall's mission to China?

Answer: No, my trip to Chongqing is to discuss with President Chiang and President Song the disposal of U.S. military property left after the withdrawal of U.S. troops from West China.

Question: It is reported that 700 U.S. aircraft have been transferred to the Chinese government. What is the truth?

Answer: The report that the U.S. military transferred 700 aircraft to the Chinese government is not true. However, the Chinese government is negotiating with the U.S. to purchase aircraft and other military equipment, but no conclusion has been reached so far.

Question: It is said that the Chinese government will purchase the U.S. military supplies transferred by you and President Song at 30% of their original value. Is this true?

Answer: The purchase price has not yet been determined. The U.S. State Department has an organization called the Materials Clearing Committee, which specializes in assisting the Army and Navy in clearing the transfer and disposal of materials. This theater also has experts to handle this matter. The price will be determined based on cost, transportation costs, and other factors.

Question: It is rumored that some U.S. pilots were detained by the Communist army near Tianjin, and some U.S. soldiers were also detained near Xuzhou. What is the truth?

Answer: Six U.S. pilots were stranded in the Communist-controlled area due to forced landings. I heard that they were treated well. I have asked President Chiang to instruct the Communist army to release them and return them.

Question: Former Commander-in-Chief of the Communist Army, Zhu De, has made serious protests to the U.S. military. Has the General responded?

Answer: The U.S. government only recognizes the Central Government as the legitimate government. The United Kingdom, the Soviet Union, and France all take the Chinese Central Government as the object of negotiation. This protest was not submitted through President Chiang, so there was no reply.

Question: The U.S. military has a liaison group in Chongqing and also a liaison group in Yan'an. Does this indicate that the U.S. recognizes the Yan'an regime?

Answer: The liaison group in Yan'an existed when I came to China. I did not withdraw the liaison group because the U.S. military did not want to be misunderstood by the Communists. In addition, the liaison group would provide information on the Japanese army and assist U.S. Air Force personnel in distress.

### Rumor of Communist Troops Invading Wanping, Another Attack on GuiSui and Baotou

[Beiping, United Press, 29th] According to Chinese sources this morning, the Communist forces are expanding in the vicinity of Beiping. Wanping, 27 li southwest of Beiping, has been invaded by Communist forces. It is reported that 10,000 Communist troops, equipped with light and heavy machine guns and artillery, have arrived at Fangshan, 75 li southwest of Beiping. It is believed that this batch of Communist troops came from Zhangjiakou. It is said that the Communist troops under Zhu De have arrived at Liangxiang, southwest of Beiping, and are requisitioning grain there, and enlisting physically strong men into the Communist army.

[Chongqing, Central News Agency, 29th] According to the Chongqing office of the Twelfth War Zone: The situation in Suiyuan is becoming serious again. (1) On the 25th, the Communist troops in the suburbs of Guisui, with more than 3,000 people and many artillery pieces carried by cars, attacked the urban area from the southeast of Guisui, but were repelled by the National Army. (2) The Communist army is transferring about 50,000 troops from the Ji-Cha (Hebei-Chahar) units, and mobilizing 20,000 new recruits from Chahar, to increase the attacks on Suibao. Among them, 3,000 people have arrived at Zhaojun Tomb, 15 kilometers south of Guisui. (3) More than 10,000 Communist troops are gathered along the line from Saxian to Baotou, commanded by He Long, equipped with heavy artillery and light and heavy machine guns, and their movements have been frequent in recent days, with a tendency to attack Baotou again. Thousands of Communist troops in Dongshengcheng and other places, 30 kilometers west of Baotou, are scurrying around.

### Communists in the United States Make Alarmist Statements, General Chennault Says

[Fort Worth, Texas, United Press, 27th] General Chennault said in a speech here that the power of the Communists in the United States has exaggerated the importance of the Chinese civil war. In fact, only about 10% of the territory and people are involved in the civil war, but if you read the news here, you will doubt that the war is spreading across the country. The Communists are spreading various false news about the Chinese civil war in the United States, deliberately downplaying the Chinese government and promoting the Communists.

### Smooth Progress in Sino-Soviet Negotiations, Our Receiving Personnel Prepare to Return to Changchun

[Chongqing, United Press, 29th] Chinese officials sent to the Nine Eastern Provinces to carry out receiving work are now preparing to return to Changchun again due to the smooth progress in Sino-Soviet negotiations. According to news from outside the Pass, General Du Yuming's troops are currently advancing towards Shenyang. General Du's headquarters has moved from Suizhong to Xingcheng. Chinese sources here say that General Du's troops are continuing to consolidate their positions, and the speed of the northward advance has slowed down to wait for the Sino-Soviet negotiations to proceed. It is said that the Soviet side has agreed to China's request to assist the National Army to be airlifted from Beiping to Changchun, Shenyang and other military strategic locations. According to news from Xuzhou, fierce fighting has broken out at Hanzhuang, 30 li north of the intersection of the Longhai and Jinpu railways. The Communist army is fiercely attacking the station in an attempt to cut off the Jinpu Line, and the National Army has also inflicted heavy blows on them.

[Chongqing, Central News Agency, 28th] Northeast Security Deputy Commander Liang Huasheng recently arrived in Chongqing and plans to take office in the middle of next month. In addition, the Southeast Cadre Training Corps presided over by Liang in Kunming will be moved to Lushan to continue operations.

### Soviet Union Opposes Trusteeship, UN Preparatory Committee Has Decided to Establish Military Staff Committee and Political Security Committee

[London, Reuters, 29th] At a meeting of the United Nations Preparatory Committee this morning, signs of divergent opinions were first discovered due to the trusteeship system. Soviet representative Gromyko stated the Soviet opposition to the trusteeship proposal. The proposal was submitted by the 14-member Executive Committee of the Preparatory Committee and advocated the establishment of a temporary United Nations body to deal with trusteeship issues. After Australian representative Hasluck presented the Executive Committee's report (Chairman Evatt was absent and is currently in Washington), Gromyko stood up and explained the following points: (1) The Soviet government cannot accept any proposals for a temporary trusteeship organization because the United Nations Charter does not stipulate the establishment of this organization, so this organization is illegal. (2) The Soviet government recognizes that when the General Assembly is convened, a supplementary organization of the main United Nations body can be established, but believes that the proposed Trusteeship Committee is by no means a supplementary organization, but a substitute for the main Trusteeship Council. (3) The temporary Trusteeship Committee proposed by the Executive Committee will have nothing to do because no land has yet been placed under United Nations trusteeship. (4) The United Nations Charter stipulates that there are three types of land that can be placed under trusteeship, namely, land received from enemy countries, land voluntarily handed over for trusteeship by United Nations member states, and territories under mandate of the former League of Nations. Gromyko has not heard of any proposal for land voluntarily accepting trusteeship. As for enemy countries, they cannot be placed under trusteeship until a peace treaty is concluded. As for mandated countries, they are now members of the United Nations, so they have already complied with the principles set by the United Nations to accept trusteeship and can propose to place their mandated territories under trusteeship at the first meeting of the General Assembly, but at the same time there is no need to establish a special organization. (5) In the Soviet view, the establishment of a temporary Trusteeship Committee will not only fail to facilitate the implementation of the Charter, but will also hinder its purpose. Gromyko's opposition today was expected by the general public, but the technical committee of the Executive Committee dealing with the trusteeship system has been affected. This proposal of the Executive Committee was approved by a majority vote, but the Czech Republic, the Soviet Union, and Yugoslavia opposed it on the grounds that the establishment of a temporary Trusteeship Committee in accordance with the United Nations Charter was illegal.

[London, Reuters, 29th] The United Nations Preparatory Committee yesterday agreed to establish two main committees, namely the Military Staff Committee and the Political Security Committee. The former will assist the Security Council of the United Nations, and the latter will be a branch of the General Assembly. The Military Staff Committee is tasked with preparing for direct action and is composed of the chiefs of staff of the five countries: China, the United Kingdom, the United States, the Soviet Union, and France. All countries in the Political Security Committee General Assembly may send representatives to participate, with the task of determining the general principles of maintaining peace. The Mexican representative advocated the establishment of another committee to deal with social and related events in order to promote social welfare and eliminate the causes of war.

### Possible Location for UN Permanent Headquarters in the United States

[London, United Press, 28th] A reporter interviewed representatives from 51 countries on the United Nations Preparatory Committee and learned that there is a trend to locate the permanent headquarters of the United Nations in the United States. Eight of the representatives said they would vote in favor of locating it in Europe, seven were unavailable, and twelve had not yet decided. The U.S. representative reiterated their unwillingness to vote. Eastern European and Latin American countries will join the Soviet Union, Ukraine, and Belarus in voting in favor of locating it in the United States. Western European countries are likely to take a common position with the United Kingdom and France, favoring locating it in Europe. Arab countries have not yet decided, and the Canadian representative is also unwilling to express an opinion. In order for this United Nations to be located in the United States, it needs a two-thirds majority, that is, 34 votes, to pass.

### Possible No Further Summit Conference, Stalin Extends Vacation

### Differing Views Between the United Kingdom and the Soviet Union, Serious Situation in Iran, Soviet Reply Fails to Satisfy Iranian Government, Iranian Rebels Change Direction and Advance Towards Rasht

[London, Reuters, 29th] According to responsible sources in London, British diplomatic documents from Iran confirm the news that Iranian rebels have crossed the border of Azerbaijan province, but qualified observers here believe that in the current situation, the rebels are unlikely to make Tehran their target. If the Iranian rebellion expands into a civil war or poses a serious threat to the current Iranian government, what policy will the Iranian allies adopt? This is a question that people in London are generally speculating about. As far as the British military is concerned, the United Kingdom has stated that it will not interfere in Iranian affairs, but has resolved to take actions of a police nature. However, informed sources do not believe that the Iranian authorities have taken this development into account. There have been no changes in diplomatic status in the past 24 hours, and the overall situation is unlikely to continue to develop before the Soviet Union replies to Sir Archibald Clark Kerr, the British ambassador to Moscow, who sent a letter to Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov at the end of the week. Informed sources in London believe that since there is no foreign force invading Iran at present and there are Allied troops stationed in the country, the importance of the incident in northern Iran should not exceed its local nature. Hostile actions between the northern Iranian tribes and the capital are commonplace in Iranian politics. However, Moscow, at least in broadcasting and newspapers, has openly expressed sympathy for the political demands of the rebels, while the British government has expressed sympathy for the rights requested by the Iranian government. Although both countries have troops stationed in Iran, their views are so different, and this is the true seriousness of the current situation.

[Tehran, Reuters, 29th] The Iranian government previously requested the Soviet government to allow Iranian troops to move in order to stop the southbound rebels. The Soviet reply has been delayed, but according to officials here, the content is not satisfactory. The wording is still polite, but all the points requested by Iran have been rejected. Official reports said that the rebels today bypassed Qazvin and turned northeast towards Rasht, and their target no longer seems to be Tehran. This news has slightly calmed the people in Tehran, but the crisis has only been delayed and should not be regarded as having been eliminated.

### Halsey Promoted to Five-Star Admiral

The council is scheduled to go to Japan at the end of next month.

[Reuters, Washington, 29th] Australian Foreign Minister Evatt, on the eve of his return to Australia, told reporters: The Far East Advisory Council has completed its initial tasks. The council will decide on the outline of the policy toward Japan. Great progress has been made in the three and a half weeks of meetings, and a preliminary agreement has been reached. However, regarding the relationship between the Soviet Union and the Far East Advisory Council, and the methods for implementing the basic policy toward Japan, although negotiations have been held repeatedly, a final agreement has not yet been reached. When Mr. Evatt was asked whether the Supreme Commander would continue to be responsible for implementing the policy toward Japan, Mr. Evatt said that as the Supreme Commander, he should have some autonomy. If his hands were completely tied, he would be powerless. A spokesman for the Far East Advisory Council said that the council is scheduled to go to Japan around December 26 and return to the United States in mid-February.

Signatories include Professor Curie, director of the French National Center for Scientific Research, Professor Cassin, vice president of the French Council of State, Mr. Vansittart, former chief diplomatic advisor to the British government, Sir William Brabazon, former British Minister of Aircraft Production, and Dr. Worthling, advisor to the Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

### US House Foreign Affairs Committee Re-Appropriates Funds to UNRRA; UNRRA Keeps Next Year's Plan for China Secret

[United Press, Washington, 28th] The House Foreign Affairs Committee has recently approved a bill to re-allocate $135 million in US dollars to the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA). Republican Congressman Vollers today suggested that before Congress discusses the bill, former Ambassador to China Hurley should be invited to testify before the House Foreign Affairs Committee, because Hurley stated in his resignation declaration that the United States is using its prestige and power to undermine democracy in the Far East and support imperialism and communism. Vollers wrote to the chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, saying that UNRRA's plan for China next year is kept secret, and why it needs to be kept secret is another secret. I firmly believe that if Hurley can give public testimony to the committee, we will have a better understanding of UNRRA's case. But according to Bloom, he does not intend to follow this suggestion.

### Most Violent Earthquake of the Century; Epicenter in the Indian Ocean; Chinese Coast Also Affected

[United Press, London, 28th] On Wednesday, seismographs in most parts of the world recorded the most violent earthquake of the century. Its epicenter was in the Indian Ocean, and the earth continued to vibrate for more than three hours. Vibrations were felt in many parts of western India.

### Local News

Qingpu

Zhangliantang Town Suffers Major Plunder: On the afternoon of the 17th of this month, more than a hundred bandits entered Zhangliantang Town in Qingpu. There were no stationed troops in the town. Although twenty or thirty young men resisted, they were ultimately defeated due to the disparity in numbers and retreated, allowing the bandits to loot freely for more than four hours. All shops and homes were robbed of clothing, jewelry, currency, etc. They were fully loaded onto small steamboats and rowboats stopped in the city river and left. Before leaving, they robbed twenty young women, including two middle school students.

Wuxi

Army and People Develop Deep Affection: Since the 49th Army of the National Army was deployed from Yixing to Wuxi, part of it has been stationed in Changzhou and Jiangyin, and part of it has been stationed in Wuxi City and the surrounding countryside. The cooperation between the army and the people is exceptionally harmonious.

### Indonesian-British-Dutch Negotiations Show Renewed Hope; Sjahrir Cabinet Gains Parliamentary Confidence

[Central News Agency, Batavia, 28th Special Dispatch] The Indonesian Information Department officially announced: When Parliament adjourned yesterday, the Sjahrir cabinet received 84 votes of confidence, with only 8 votes against. Following this announcement, there is great hope that Indonesia and Britain and the Netherlands will soon reopen negotiations. The new government now has the support of its people and is qualified to negotiate according to its intended policy. Seventeen of the twenty-five members of the newly established Standing Committee (the other eight are yet to be elected according to the regional system) met for the first time today to discuss the draft treaty. One of the provisions in the future treaty will clearly stipulate the status of overseas Chinese.

Dutch Authorities Clarify Position

[Reuters, London, 29th] It is reported that Dr. Logeman recently met with British newspaper reporters and expressed the view that Dutch troops should land in Java immediately to help suppress the rebellion. Dr. Logeman said that the Netherlands does not intend to suppress the national movement and is willing to cooperate with it. However, the prerequisite is to restore order in the area and confiscate the weapons of the rioters before negotiations can begin. The new Indonesian Prime Minister Sjahrir is still a respected person, and his cabinet members are also mostly capable, unlike Sukarno, who colluded with the Japanese. We are willing to treat Sjahrir as the leader of the Indonesian national movement and negotiate with him, but we do not intend to treat him as the Prime Minister of the Indonesian Republic. At the beginning of his tenure, Sjahrir also stated his willingness to negotiate, but was held hostage by extremists and failed to do so. Now, he is demanding complete independence and separation from the Kingdom of the Netherlands, which makes negotiations almost impossible. We are prepared to allow Indonesians to participate in the cabinet and parliament, and we also want them to become part of the Kingdom of the Netherlands. However, complete independence and autonomy are not yet on the table.

### US Senator Johnson Accuses Government of Moving Towards War with the Soviet Union

[Reuters, Washington, 29th] Senator Johnson said during a Senate debate yesterday: The United States is now moving towards war with the Soviet Union in a definite and rapid manner.

The Russians know very well that we are only threatening with a pistol without bullets, and their understanding of our country will only increase with time.

### Yunnan Provincial Assembly Submits Proposal to Ministry, Advocating Distribution of National University Locations, Stipulating Regulations for Exchange Professors

[Dahua News Agency, Chongqing Dispatch] Our country has a vast territory, and in the past, due to transportation difficulties, the cultural levels of various regions differed significantly. The Yunnan Provincial Assembly, in view of this, specially requested the Ministry of Education to carefully distribute the locations of national universities and to formulate measures for exchanging teachers, stating roughly: Most of our country's national universities are located in Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, and Wuhan. During the War of Resistance against Japan, they successively moved to Guizhou, Sichuan, Yunnan and Guizhou. Now that the war is over and education is restored, the relocated schools are moving back to their original locations one after another. It is believed that at this time, it is urgently necessary to coordinate the overall situation and distribute resources properly. If the environment requires it, those who have relocated may remain at their new locations. Even those who need to move should not return to their original locations entirely. In general, it should be adapted to local conditions so that university education in various places can develop evenly, so as not to cause schools to cluster in places with convenient transportation, causing overcrowding, while remote areas must travel thousands of miles to study, making it difficult to seek knowledge. Fortunately, air transport is now developed, and shrinking the earth is possible. A journey of thousands of miles can be reached from morning to evening. The problem of transportation obstruction no longer exists in fact. Therefore, the distribution area of each national university should be carefully selected and properly handled before the school is moved to meet the needs of the situation. In addition, it is also requested that regulations be established for each university to exchange professors with each other every year, and strictly implement them, so that the deficiencies can be made up for, and students across the country can receive excellent education, and the interior and borders can be developed evenly. The infusion of ideas and research of academics should have a great effect. However, for teachers who take turns serving in remote areas, preferential regulations should be formulated to compensate for their hard work and to reward their interest in serving in other places. It is said that the Ministry of Education is carefully considering this proposal.

### Chengyou Cup Basketball Tournament: Crucial Match: Liangxi vs. Shantou; Donghua Can Secure Victory Against Feima

The Chengyou Cup will feature two matches today starting at 5:30 PM as usual. The match between Liangxi and Shantou is particularly crucial. Liangxi has already won two consecutive games, while Shantou has not yet encountered a strong team, maintaining an unbeaten record. This encounter is bound to be a battle of wits and strength, with each team striving for victory. Today's schedule is as follows:

Donghua vs. Feima (Group A) 5:30 PM

Liangxi vs. Shantou (Group A) 5:30 PM

Donghua can expect to secure victory against Feima, as Feima is inferior in both skill and experience. Moreover, Donghua players like Jia Youliang and Han Longhai are excellent players in both soccer and basketball, and the team is adept at fostering harmony, with fans readily providing enthusiastic support, giving them an advantage in terms of momentum. Facing a weak Feima team, they can hope for a satisfactory result beyond just winning.

The Liangxi team certainly has excellent players, but being a relatively new team, they inevitably lack coordination. Their performance relies mainly on experience. Conversely, the Shantou team has been together for many years, relying on well-honed teamwork to prevail. Moreover, newcomer He Lide is improving rapidly, not yielding much to the veteran players. Today's clash of two strong teams will have a significant impact on their future prospects, making it difficult to secure victory. It is believed that Liangxi needs all its players to be in peak condition to have a chance. Shantou must avoid panic, remain calm, and apply steady tactics, using their strengths to attack the opponent's weaknesses. Liangxi's veteran players are bound to be challenged. Let's see how both teams perform today.

### The Establishment of the Taiwan Cultural Advancement Association (Continued from yesterday)

— You Mijian

(6) We feel the importance of our work and the need to actively carry it out. Therefore, we will publish a journal called "Modern Weekly" soon, and hold popular lecture meetings. We will also start teaching Mandarin Chinese, as well as other social service work.

Officer Chen said, "Taiwan is the nursery of the Three Principles of the People." In order to achieve this ideal nursery, we must first remove the poisonous weeds planted by imperialist Japan, and the land must be replowed. On the one hand, we must use good fertilizers from the motherland and the world—the culture of freedom and democracy—to water it. With this work, our good seeds—the Taiwanese—can grow as much as possible, and become good seedlings of the Three Principles of the People, transplanted to the mainland, and transplanted to all parts of the world. This is our supreme glory, our supreme happiness!

We Taiwanese are originally the best seeds of the Han people. In the long historical process of thousands of years, because we did not succumb to the oppression of foreign races, we moved from the Central Plains to Fujian, and from Fujian to Taiwan. In Taiwan, we were first oppressed by the Manchu Qing, and then abused and exploited by Japanese imperialism, but we still maintained a strong national consciousness, were not assimilated by Japan, and did not lose our national spirit. This proves that we are good seeds. Now that we know we are good seeds, we must do better, so we must improve our self-awareness. Now that we can return to the blue sky and white sun, we have the opportunity to grow as much as possible. We can be an example to others, we can build an ideal Taiwan, and we firmly believe that we can do it. But we need to remove the poisonous weeds from this nursery, and water it with good fertilizers, in order to obtain normal and comprehensive development. This work of weeding, plowing, and fertilizing is the goal of our colleagues in the Cultural Advancement Association. We hope everyone will work together and move towards this goal, assisting the government in construction, to complete the ideal New Taiwan!

### American Financial and Industrial Circles Willing to Invest Heavily in China, Assisting China in Establishing Large-Scale Industries

Talks by Mr. Franklin, Chairman of the American Far East Trade Committee

[Special interview by this newspaper] Mr. Franklin, former Director-General of the Shanghai Municipal Council, has been appointed Chairman of the Far East Trade Committee by the American Foreign Trade Association. He arrived in Shanghai by plane a few days ago to investigate the state of trade in China. This reporter visited him yesterday, and according to Mr. Franklin, both Chinese and American merchants hope that trade between the two countries can be smooth in the short term.

An urgent need to conclude a friendly commercial treaty

Currently, many problems cannot be resolved, leaving merchants in both countries with plans and resources but unable to start restoring regular trade between the two countries. The first key to restoring trade is to conclude a Sino-American friendship and commerce treaty. The American side submitted a draft to the Chinese government a year ago for their comments. However, discussions on the treaty have not yet been finalized.

Hoping to obtain reasonable guarantees

Secondly, major issues such as foreign exchange rates and foreign exchange freezes have not been resolved. Currently, the American government and business community are paying close attention to the measures of China's new company law. The American side hopes that the law can provide foreign capital with practical and reasonable guarantees. Before coming to China, Mr. Franklin discussed trade and investment issues with American authorities and the business community. According to Mr. Franklin, leaders of American financial and industrial circles are willing to make large-scale investments in China to assist China in establishing large-scale industries.

American capitalists consider two points

I have lived in China for more than 20 years, and China is my second home. Therefore, I must say frankly: many countries are eager to obtain American capital after the war. When choosing investment targets, American capitalists must first consider whether the capital can be guaranteed and whether the promotion of business can be facilitated. If China wants to attract large amounts of American capital and encourage American investment, it should pay close attention to these two points.

Foreign banks obtain licenses to operate

Foreign banks in this city, such as HSBC, Mercantile Bank of India, China and London, Citibank, Chase Bank, Banque de l'Indochine, and the Dutch Bank, have completed registration procedures with the Ministry of Finance, applied for licenses, and obtained legal status in order to participate in the Bankers' Association. They will only be able to start operations after the foreign exchange rate is determined. In addition, banks established in the wartime capital that wish to establish branches in Shanghai must have been in operation for more than four years and be approved by the Ministry of Finance.

### Marshall Appointed Special Envoy, American Military Extremely Excited

Since the news of General Marshall's appointment as the United States Special Ambassador to China was confirmed, Chinese and American people here have been very excited, especially the American military. They believe that General Marshall has worked in both China and the Soviet Union, and is very familiar with the situation in the Soviet Union. The American military believes that after Marshall takes office, he will have new measures for the current situation.

Responding to the conscription movement

Responding to the conscription movement, 36 people have enlisted in the military from the 20th of this month to yesterday, and will continue to serve for three years. In addition, American soldiers who have not yet completed their service in China will remain in China to work.

Nine thousand American soldiers return home

Walterman, the Director of the U.S. Military Affairs Department, announced today that the U.S. military will transport 9,000 officers and soldiers back to the country for service in these two weeks.

American ship shot at again

According to foreign sources, Rear Admiral C.E. Eyre, Commander of the U.S. Yangtze Patrol, announced yesterday that on the afternoon of the 27th of this month, when a U.S. ship was returning from Hankou to Shanghai, it was suddenly fired upon from the shore when it reached Bali, upstream of Jizhou (transliteration). The U.S. ship also returned fire at the time. No U.S. troops were injured, and the ship was not damaged. This is the second time a U.S. ship has been shot at in the Yangtze River area.

### Inventory of Warehouse Materials, Part of it Sold Off Early at Discount Prices

The warehouses in this city, previously entrusted to the Jianghai Customs by the Bureau of Enemy and Puppet Property, have been undergoing inventory procedures since the 9th of this month, which is very time-consuming. It is reported that as of now, the Navy has completed the transfer of the 200 warehouses it received, of which more than 40 have been fully inventoried. The Third Front Army Headquarters, the Military Affairs Department Commissioner's Office, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, the Central Trust of China, and other agencies have also handed over the warehouses they previously sealed or received for inventory. In addition, the materials that have been inventoried in the warehouses are also being processed one after another. In particular, perishable items such as fish, eggs, and biscuits will be processed early. It is estimated that there are 4,000 tons of fish, 500 tons of eggs, and 27,000 boxes of biscuits in storage. It is reported that the biscuits will be gradually supplied to the market at discounted prices by the Five Companies. Eggs, except for a part that can be exported, will be temporarily retained and efforts will be made to export them. The rest will be auctioned off in batches by the Bureau of Enemy and Puppet Property. As for the fish sold at discounted prices, it is reported that the Bureau of Enemy and Puppet Property will entrust the fish market to handle it, and the price will be 70% of the current market price. The price of each catty of large yellow croaker is set at 120 yuan. Each fishmonger can sell one to ten shi dan (traditional Chinese unit of weight) per day, and each household is limited to five jin (traditional Chinese unit of weight) per day. In addition, some daily necessities such as cloth will be transported to Chongqing using the remaining tonnage of ships and aircraft returning to Chongqing. It is reported that they will also be supplied to the market there at discounted prices.

### Grand Variety Show to Celebrate Allied and National Army

All circles in this city have decided to hold a show on December 1st, simultaneously with other parts of the country, to celebrate the Allied and National Army in Shanghai. The show will focus on spiritual comfort for the Allied forces, including dramas, souvenirs (issuing invitation cards with commemorative significance), and dinner dances. For the National Army, both spiritual and material comfort will be emphasized, including Peking opera, movies, dramas, and comfort items (determined based on the recruitment results). Dr. Mei Lanfang has also agreed to perform on December 8th to entertain the officers of the Allied and National Army. The show schedule is as follows:

### Commander Tang Hosts Press Conference, Discusses Current Issues

General Tang Enbo, Commander of the Third Front Army, held a press conference at 10:00 AM yesterday (29th) in the conference room on the second floor of the headquarters on North Sichuan Road. Tang gave detailed answers to the questions asked by the reporters. The main points were: (1) The military reorganization conference has passed a plan to reduce the quantity and improve the quality of the national army. There are no major security problems in the Jiangnan area. The surrender work in Nanjing and Shanghai has gradually been completed, and the restoration of order in the countryside is even more important than the restoration of order in the cities. (2) Regarding the high prices in Shanghai, he believes that there is no need to be pessimistic. Efforts are being made to restore transportation in order to lower prices. (3) He expressed great excitement about General Marshall succeeding Hurley as ambassador to China. In the future, Sino-American cooperation will be closer and more coordinated. Finally, he put forward two hopes: (1) He hopes that reporters can regularly go deep into the cities and villages of Jiangnan to conduct more general and extensive inspections and research. (2) He hopes that reporters will provide more criticism and guidance on the Jiangnan area and the Third Front Army based on what they see and hear.

### Truth About Russian Bloodshed Case

A Russian bloodshed case occurred in a room on the fourth floor of a foreign apartment at No. 843 North Sichuan Road a few days ago. It is learned that the deceased was a Russian woman named Lupu, 36 years old, who was the mistress of a Russian man named Widkin. Because she had a new love, she quarreled with Widkin, so she mixed poison into her drink. After Lupu drank it, Widkin stabbed her head with a sharp knife, killing her. It is reported that Widkin had committed theft in Harbin in 1937.

### Xu Guomao Transferred to Shanghai, Appointed Manager of Jinyou Bank

The Minsheng Company's Yangtze River passenger ship Minli is currently being repaired and is scheduled to sail to Hankou on the 4th of next month. The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Jianghan transport ship is scheduled to sail from Shanghai on the 2nd. The Minlian ship will be launched from Chongqing to Shanghai and is expected to arrive on the 2nd.

The Xinruian ship arrived in Keelung on the 19th. Due to strong winds at sea, it was delayed in leaving Taiwan.

### Weather Forecast

Over the East Sea, there are clouds and fog, with moderate northeasterly or southeasterly winds. Yesterday's temperature was a minimum of 55.8 degrees and a maximum of 58.5 degrees.

### Bars: A New Emerging Business in the City's Gold Rush

Businessmen's minds are perhaps the most sensitive. They saw batches of Allied soldiers arriving in Shanghai from the sky or sea, and saw through their boring lives caused by the war. Therefore, they focused on the word "adjustment" and tried their best to bring comfort to the Allied soldiers, while making a profit. Recently, many new industries have emerged in this city, especially bars, which have exceeded 700. However, businessmen often only care about profit and ignore the necessary morality, so 148 of them have been ordered to close down, which is very heartbreaking for them. Every time the lights come on, the bars on Zhu Baoshan Road and the East Zhongzheng Road are the most active and the most numerous. Their only way to attract customers is the sign "American Soldiers Allowed Inside" given to them by the US military authorities. The second is the music and the dozens of "English-speaking" dancing girls—"bar girls". As for the drinks sold, beer is the most popular. An Anle Palace can sell about 20 cases a day.

There are also many bars on Xiafei Road, Albert Road, East Broadway Road, and Tilanqiao. However, the business is slightly worse than that on East Zhongzheng Road. The hosts are mostly Jewish, but the types of drinks sold are quite exquisite. As for the prices, they are no longer allowed to be set arbitrarily as they were at the beginning. This is due to the warning effect of "American Soldiers Not Allowed Inside". Now the price of beer is between 400 and 700 yuan, and the price of brandy and whiskey is between 700 and 1,200 yuan per glass.

In the bars, you can see all kinds of patterns. Soldiers like to drink, and they are not willing to put down their glasses unless they are drunk. Therefore, at 11:30 every night, many American military police go to the bars to patrol and send the drunk soldiers back. Otherwise, they will simply fall asleep until they wake up.

There are also a large number of people who live off the bars. They sell paper flowers or other small items to earn a small profit. Of course, rickshaw drivers are also included.

Recently, the authorities have felt that this abnormal development of bars has been restricted and those that remain will be reviewed. This is nothing more than to make the operators of the bars earn profits in a proper way. (Dun)

The central government has stipulated that from 0:00 on January 1st of next year, highway traffic will all be changed to driving on the right. Various circles have not yet understood the reasons and methods for changing to driving on the right. The following is an exploration of the reasons from the Municipal Public Works Bureau:

### From New Year's Day, Highway Traffic Drives on the Right. The Municipal Public Works Bureau Announces the Reasons.

(A) Reasons for the change: (1) Most of the cars recently imported into China are from the United States. The steering wheel and lights are all designed according to the American traffic rules of driving on the right. According to our country's current traffic rules, which require driving on the left, the steering wheel and lights must be modified first. The cost of this modification is about one-fifth of the original price, that is, for every five vehicles modified, the cost of six vehicles must be paid. Therefore, in order to save modification costs, it is urgent to drive on the right. (2) Although there are cars driving on the left and right in various countries around the world, according to statistics in 1936, cars driving on the right accounted for more than 90% of the total number of cars. In order to adapt to the trend of highway traffic in the world, it is urgent to change to driving on the right. (3) At present, due to the fact that no new cars have been imported into our country for several years, the number of cars has gradually decreased due to damage and wear. Although the China-India road is open, a large number of new cars have not been transported in. This is a great opportunity to change the direction of traffic, because it is easier to change when there are fewer vehicles, and at the same time, the accidents and dangers caused by the change can also be reduced.

(B) Stipulated methods: (1) Human-powered vehicles, such as hand carts, bicycles, rickshaws, small flat carts, and large flat carts, etc., animal-powered vehicles such as large carts and carriages, etc., and sedan chairs, etc., shall all be changed to driving on the right from the date of the change in the direction of car traffic. (2) Troops marching and mass parades should drive on the right to be consistent with vehicles. (3) If a team of pedestrians is mixed with vehicles, they should walk on the right like vehicles. However, the local police station or the responsible highway agency must be notified in advance. (4) Non-organized pedestrians walking on the sidewalk will not be regulated.

### The Bond Market Soars: Class C Bonds Approach the 600 Mark

Hot and Cold Issues Differ by One-Third

Bond market bulls continue to manipulate, refusing to release their holdings. Individual investors with both money and stocks continue to join in, resulting in demand exceeding supply. Major players seize the opportunity to raise prices, forcing those who borrowed to sell short to reluctantly cover their positions at a loss. Market prices soar, with Class E and C bonds leading the surge, followed by miscellaneous issues. As a result, prices rise by another 120 to 150 points, with Class C bonds closing as high as 660. Consequently, Class A and B bonds also reach prices above 400 yuan. Speculation is rampant, with price differences between various classes widening to around 200 yuan. A one-third difference between hot and cold issues is also a remarkable phenomenon.

The Chinese stock market is sluggish as the Securities Industry Trade Association Organization Committee posts notices throughout the trading floors advising the cessation of trading. However, those who profited handsomely from public bonds are not lacking in those seeking to raise prices, resulting in a strong market following an initial dip, ultimately closing slightly lower than before.

The foreign stock market remains stable, fluctuating with gold prices. Jardine Matheson Cotton Mill stock is stable around 1450 yuan, trading up to 1500 yuan, ultimately closing with little change from before and very little trading activity.

### U.S. Dollar Price Weakens Slightly

Yesterday, the U.S. dollar weakened further due to smaller reports from the Chongqing market. However, the process was extremely stable. After opening in the morning, sellers were active, and the price gradually declined from 775,000 to 756,000. Subsequently, banks slightly bought to take advantage of the low price, providing support. At noon, short sellers were forced to close their positions, briefly reaching 777,000, ultimately hovering around 770,000. The price closed slightly lower than before, by 20,000. Gold shops lowered their gold exchange rate to 8.3 yuan per tael. Refined silver remained at 650, and silver dollars remained robust, with the asking price rising slightly to 460. Informal discounts weakened further, falling to around 13 fen.

The U.S. dollar continues to fall with gold prices. Cotton yarn merchants are quite interested in purchasing. The situation is still stable, and the price fluctuates around 1310 yuan throughout the day, ultimately closing down 20 yuan from before. Hong Kong currency is stable, with old currency closing slightly lower by 5 yuan, and new currency remaining unchanged.

Rice Prices Firm

Yesterday, the rice market saw equal supply and demand, resulting in a firm market and price increases of 200 to 300 yuan. Flour sales are brisk, and the market is stable. The price of oil continues to fall, driven by supplies from Qingdao, declining by another thousand yuan or so. Soybean cake softened from Qingdao, falling by a thousand yuan. Soybeans and soybean cake both declined, becoming sluggish, with prices falling by 300 to 400 yuan.

Yarn Sales Weaken

Cotton yarn sales decline, and market sentiment weakens. 20-count yarn falls by 20,000 yuan, and 16-count yarn also falls by about 10,000 yuan. Fine yarn prices remain firm due to extremely scarce inventory. Yesterday, the "Hua Feng" ship arrived, carrying 125 bales of Yuyao cotton and 15 boxes of tea from Ningbo.

Coal Market Stagnant

The white coal market continues to be sluggish due to frequent sales of accumulated inventories. The prices of white coal lumps and bituminous coal lumps remain stagnant because holders are unwilling to sell at low prices due to limited inventory in the market. Bituminous coal sees slight demand from ships and factories, with prices similar to previous market levels. Firewood continues its previous downward trend. The charcoal market is relatively stable.

Dyestuff Market Weakens

Dyestuffs are weakening because goods already procured by Sichuan merchants are awaiting shipment, but cargo ship tonnage is limited and insufficient. Furthermore, dyestuffs stored in various ports are being shipped back to the city (before the war, a large number of dyestuffs were shipped to Hangzhou, Wenzhou, and Nanjing for asset safety). Consequently, Sichuan merchants and others are taking a wait-and-see approach, leading to a consistent price decline and a gradual trend toward sluggishness.

### Economic Briefs

The Photography Industry Association continues its activities and increases prices without prior approval. The authorities have been informed and have issued a letter to the Bureau for suppression.

Mu Zengyuan of the lumber industry and Lu Bingkun of the timber industry were successively appointed to organize their respective trade associations. However, because the two industries are similar in nature, they were ordered to merge into one trade association.

Sheng Shuming and twelve other owners of fashionable clothing stores in the city have initiated the formation of the Rong Sewing Industry Trade Association, which is currently awaiting approval. It is reported that local guilds, such as pears, which have not been reorganized or did not exist before the war, can jointly initiate and apply for organization.

Maolin Wool Weaving Company has decided to dissolve after a special shareholders meeting and has already established a liquidation office.

### Reorganization of Stated Capital Amounts

— Pan Shihao

(Continued from November 28th)

Therefore, regarding the accusation of illegal capitalization increase by some people, I would also like to provide my humble opinion for reference. Increasing capital requires a change of registration for companies, and a renewal of licenses for partnerships and sole proprietorships. This is to obtain legal standing against third parties, not regarding the internal relationships between shareholders and partners. Increasing capital requires a resolution by the shareholders' meeting for companies, and a resolution by the partners' meeting for partnerships, before filling out subscription forms or rewriting partnership agreements. Shareholders and partners are bound by these internal contracts. The relocation of the responsible government agency has delayed the change of registration, preventing enforcement against third parties. Now that the country has been recovered and our government has returned, procedures can be completed based on the facts with the responsible government agency. How can the increase of capital received in fake currency or not registered be deemed illegal and dismissed? In recent years, apart from a few capital increases intended to artificially inflate stock prices, many factories and firms have genuinely requested shareholders to increase capital, receiving cash in the form of "fake currency" to avoid bankruptcy, maintain expenses, and continue operation and reopening. Many of these factories and firms have ultimately failed due to insufficient subsequent support and have been eliminated. The surviving ones are attempting to reorganize and seek remedies. We should sympathize with them. In addition, for newly established gold businesses, even if their capital is entirely paid in fake currency, the situation is similarly "innocent." They can be allowed to complete the establishment registration or be treated as a new establishment. How can their initial capital being fake currency lead to a blanket characterization of being "fake"? Critics also say that capital increases during the occupation period were often poorly executed, causing

Existing Shareholders to Suffer

This probably refers to shareholders who could not participate in the capital increase. I also agree. According to law, capital increase should first be offered to existing shareholders in proportion to their original investment. Any remaining shares can then be offered to new investors. Considering that the company has a solid foundation, existing shareholders should be given priority. During the war, when the purchasing power of currency was declining, if the assets were valued at market value during the resolution of the capital increase, they would often exceed the book value. Existing shareholders who could not participate in the capital increase due to unavoidable or non-attributable reasons would suffer significantly. Strictly speaking, the board of directors should bear the responsibility. However, this responsibility is another issue that cannot be fully discussed in a few thousand words and will be addressed in a separate article in the future. In any case, the already-received capital increase should not be discounted due to the fake currency's worthlessness. Therefore, I believe that the reorganization of stated capital amounts should focus entirely on whether there is or could be such a capital amount in legal tender. If so, the current book value should be converted to legal tender as soon as possible. If it is insufficient, it can be reduced. The procedures, timing, etc., should be simplified so that businesses can determine their capital amounts and begin reorganizing other complex matters. As for other issues,

They Must Not Be Resolved Together

For example, whether the increase procedures are legal, how to compensate for the harm to existing shareholders, how to report and pay taxes for companies with solid foundations, and how to treat laborers favorably are all separate issues. Why should the reorganization of stated capital amounts be complicated by these issues? Why should they be delayed? Furthermore, how can these issues be hidden under the reorganization of stated capital amounts and be smuggled through? Some people either don't discuss it at all, believing it is not worth discussing, or when asked about the method, they have none. When they do discuss it, they have many concerns and believe that it must be discussed thoroughly. I venture to say that there will never be a reorganization method for stated capital amounts that is perfectly legal, ideal, and practical. However, one point must be solemnly mentioned: Under the aforementioned reorganization methods, the government should

Consider Exempting Taxes

To avoid more concerns for entrepreneurs, as income tax, profit tax, and labor bonuses will cause disputes. Except that laborers should be treated individually by each company based on actual circumstances, taking both sides into consideration, the tax issues, such as capital amounts transferred due to the appreciation of fixed assets, should be exempt from tax. If they are derived from undistributed profits, the industry trade association can provide a fair estimate and report it to simplify the process. Now that the country has been recovered and everything has been renewed, with a legitimate government in place, businesses can confidently seek guidance and adhere to the standards. (The End)

Spring and Autumn

### Great News

— Huang Jiayin

At the tea party hosted by Mr. Zhang Daofan and Deputy Minister of the Central Propaganda Department, Mr. Xu Xiaoyan, for the cultural figures of Feng City on November 28th, Mr. Xu delivered great news to those present. He said that the government had made an important decision to revise the current publishing law to implement freedom of the press and freedom of publication. He also said that the new publishing law has been drafted and is now being reviewed by the Legislative Yuan. It will be implemented after its approval.

Mr. Xu also said that the registration of newspapers, magazines, and publications in the future will only be a matter of procedure, not a matter of restriction. This is truly an exciting and gratifying event for the cultural circles in China. The promulgation and implementation of the new publishing law will take China's politics and society a big step toward democracy and openness.

In the United States, in England, and even in France, all censorship was completely abolished and normalcy was restored within a few days after the end of the war. Because in a truly democratic country, newspapers and publications are the general assembly of public opinion, and public opinion is the guideline for the government to handle national affairs. In order to show respect for public opinion, the government must only impose restrictions on the people in the most necessary places and when absolutely necessary. Now our government has decided to abolish censorship and implement freedom of the press and publication. Although some may think it is a little late, it is better late than never.

We welcome the announcement of this good news, and we welcome the early realization of this good news!

### Foreigners in Concentration Camps

— Feng Da

A few days ago, I ran into a foreign friend who had just come out of a concentration camp. After six years of separation, I could not help but feel mixed emotions. He said that he lived in a concentration camp for three years, tasting all the hardships he had never tasted before, and also saw through many bright and dark sides of life. There is a meaning of spending three years in a concentration camp is better than reading books for ten years.

He said that when he first entered the concentration camp, he ate two meals a day, each with only a small bowl of cold rice and some vegetables. Later, when there was not enough food to distribute, he ate only one meal a day. Because foreigners were not used to this kind of food and the amount was small, everyone felt undernourished. My friend's weight decreased from one hundred fifty or sixty pounds to just over one hundred ten pounds, and at one point all of his hair fell out. Many people in the camp had the same phenomenon. When everyone came out of the concentration camp, they all wanted to eat a big meal because they had been hungry for several years. As a result, after eating, they all had stomach pains because their stomachs and intestines could not absorb the food.

There were many big bosses of foreign companies and bank managers in the camp, who usually had servants all over the house. After entering the concentration camp, they had to do everything themselves, which they found very difficult to get used to. Several pampered managers and their wives were lazy by nature and were unwilling to do anything at first. But as a result, they had no food to eat if they did not do anything, so they had to raise their hands to do it.

I asked my friend how they knew the news of the victory. He said that they had a special "secret code" for communicating the news. Several foreigners in the camp who were sick were specially allowed by the Japanese to go to the hospital for treatment. They had a red motorcycle that passed by the concentration camp every day. Everyone agreed that if there was good news, they would wrap a white handkerchief around the car light as a signal. On the morning of August 11, the foreigners in the camp saw the red motorcycle pass by, with a white cloth wrapped around the car light, knowing that there was good news coming, so there was an uproar of cheers. But in the next few days, when the car passed by, there was no white cloth on the car light, and everyone was depressed again. It was not until mid-August, when the news of Japan's formal surrender was announced, that the car passed by again with white cloth wrapped around the car light, and everyone knew that victory had truly come.

In order to prevent Allied planes from bombing, the Japanese deliberately built two factories near the foreign concentration camp. There were several workers in the factory who often threw notes to the foreigners to report the news. After the victory, the factories were shut down, and these workers who reported the news were introduced to jobs by the foreigners in the camp so that they would not lose their jobs.

My friend said that a large truck often transported food and fuel to the concentration camp. There was a worker on the truck who could say a very limited number of English words. Everyone did not know who he was. After the victory, this worker suddenly appeared in a smart military uniform, speaking fluent English. It turned out that he was an underground worker sent by the Central Government, specializing in investigating the living conditions of foreigners in the camps of the United States and China, and reporting to the Central Government.

Once in the concentration camp, a Japanese man in charge of the concentration camp slapped a foreigner for no reason. The foreigners in the camp were filled with righteous indignation and went out to demonstrate as a whole, and expressed that if they did not apologize to the foreigners, everyone decided to fight to the death with the Japanese army, even at the cost of their lives. Seeing that public anger was hard to offend, the Japanese army finally called on the Japanese to apologize to the foreigners and promised that there would be no similar incident in the future.

There were four Japanese people in the camp who were particularly fierce and brutal to the foreigners. Everyone hated them and publicly declared that after the victory, they would definitely get them and be satisfied. Later, when victory came, the four Japanese knew that they could not escape, so they quietly disappeared and disappeared. In addition, a Chinese man who worked as a tiger also packed up and left on the day of victory.

### Civil Judgment

— Fang Gang

On the black iron gate of Pan Nisansheng on Jules Plass Road, in addition to the seals of the Third Front Army, there were also a few words written in chalk. One of them said: "All the heroes have been used up, and their descendants will become human beings!" Another sentence says: "Do a good job and kill well, such a hero!"

Under the protection of the enemy and puppets, Pan Nisansheng can be considered a "hero" who once dominated. However, "hero hero," "where is he now?"

The chalk words outside Pan's iron gate are the people's judgment of him.

### Beyond Worry

— He Yuanshen

Having just welcomed the victory, many young people are suffering from worry again. They do not believe in war, they do not believe in politics, they do not believe in everything; they cannot be satisfied with reality, and they cannot be satisfied with many, many things. So they worry, worry, all day long, and in fact, they themselves understand that this worry does not help the facts.

Eight years of hard resistance war has given the country an opportunity to grow. Everyone sees this opportunity. Young people have a unified thought, wanting to seize the opportunity and immediately turn their dreams into reality. This is a kind of good intention of young people. They love their motherland too much.

However, they do not yet have the strength to seize this opportunity, but they hate others for not grasping it firmly, or for not being able to quickly turn their dreams into reality after grasping it, so they cannot avoid disappointment, annoyance, and worry.

Growing up in this country, we do not need to criticize young people. They want their motherland to grow, and they are not wrong. But we cannot help but feel pain, watching these young people being tormented by worry, with no intention of doing things or reading books.

When we go to the orchard, we are unwilling to pick oranges that have not matured. When we go to the forest, we are unwilling to cut down trees that have not become timber. Water flows that are not suitable for use must be dredged, and barren soil must be fertilized. For young people, I do not want to sing the empty slogan of "reading to save the country," because this slogan was once abandoned by young people. When the motherland was in danger, in order to rescue the land that was about to fall and the fate of becoming slaves, doing something practical was a great work.

Now, we, young friends, have completed this work. The motherland's troubles have become how to seize this opportunity for growth. In order to make this opportunity more stable, we must seek a more solid foundation. Sour fruits should be left on the tree to wait for maturity, and small trees that have not yet become timber should be allowed to grow and flourish. Things should be put in the hands of their owners, and learning should be made useful.

Therefore, a more arduous task is now placed on the shoulders of young friends. We have no way to make a green apple turn red immediately, and we have no way to make a small tree grow thick, but if they do not die young, they will be the materials that support the cornerstone. Regarding current worries, if we think that we have not done enough preparatory work before, we should start doing it now. For young people, there is nothing more important than reading at present. Because the current motherland is calling for people with real knowledge and skills. For the sake of the country, we should be more rational.

### Three Days in Pan County

— Song Mu

The car turned left and right, going up and down the mountain ridges, finally stopping in an open space. It was still about a mile from the county seat, but the car had broken down and refused to move no matter how much it was shaken. The engine puffed out white smoke, filling the air.

It seemed we had no choice but to walk. Already tired enough, this made us even more travel-worn. It was already dusk when we reached the county seat. Wisps of smoke rose from the low eaves, and stray dogs barked at these outsiders.

A robust porter led us to an inn. The roof was very low, and several beds were arranged across a single main room. One or two sparks of light shone in the darkness, and someone was lying down, smoking.

Soon, the lanky driver arrived. He said he had tried his best, but the car couldn't be repaired. Our only hope was that a vehicle from the road bureau would pass by tomorrow; otherwise, we would have to stay here.

After a while, the porter lit an oil lamp. The walls of the room were made of woven straw mats, so when it was quiet, you could clearly hear the wind howling outside. The lamplight was weak and dim, flickering constantly. The shadows of the travelers lying on the bed jumped up and down on the wall.

The innkeeper had a daughter, about fourteen or fifteen years old, with two shiny braids. She often walked back and forth in the room, and people's eyes would focus on her as she passed. But she often kept her head down, silently, with melancholy hidden in her eyes.

After dinner, the travelers' spirits rose, and they began to talk and laugh. The smoking friend also sat up from the bed, drinking strong tea. The little girl came over again. So a busybody pulled her small hand and teased her:

"Hey, little girl, how old are you? Do you have a fiancé?"

A tea merchant next to them chimed in, pointing at me:

"Why don't you marry her to this young man! Look, what a great couple!"

The little girl's face was flushed with pink, struggling desperately. Once freed, she hurried away.

A burst of laughter rose behind her, and some even clapped their hands red.

The tea merchant didn't forget to wink at me.

"Hey, young man, what do you think? Not bad, right? An oval face. Didn't you notice those shy eyes of hers?"

Afterward, they changed the subject, boldly discussing their experiences.

Then they laughed lewdly. In such occasions, nothing aroused their interest more than talking about their experiences with women.

I can't remember when I heavily fell into the land of dreams. People's conversations gradually became sparse, and the night seemed very deep.

The next day, we couldn't leave. No vehicle from the road bureau arrived.

We were bored enough in this small town in southern Guizhou – a desolate wilderness, a desolate silence.

It was quite interesting. I wandered to the City God Temple in the corner of the town. At the entrance, I suddenly spotted the little girl, carrying a basket of fresh flowers with her companions. I wanted to go over and say something to her, but as soon as she saw me, she blushed and ran away.

Afterward, I ran into her several times at the inn, but she always avoided me intentionally or unintentionally. Eventually, she even stopped doing things like pouring water for the guests, hiding in the corner instead. The travelers noticed this strange phenomenon, and some wanted to settle accounts with me, saying it was all my fault that the little girl was too embarrassed to meet their eyes. Others whispered, "It's so funny, the little girl is shy."

As usual, I replaced my answer with a smile.

We stayed in this desolate little town for another two days. On the fourth day, a car arrived at noon, and we swarmed towards it joyfully.

From the car window, I saw the little girl standing in the crowd, staring with wide eyes. Our eyes met, and this time, unexpectedly, she didn't look away.

The car swayed a few times and then sped off. Behind us, it left a large cloud of yellow smoke and a pair of melancholic eyes that slowly expanded in my mind.

### Fallen Leaves

— Tian Ye

On an autumn morning, I was walking in a lonely garden.

Occasionally, lightly and quietly, two or three fallen leaves drifted down.

I bent down to pick up the withered yellow leaf, caressing it; but immediately I discarded it again and trampled on it.

"Go! Withered, old leaf!" I said to the fallen leaf lying on the ground. "Let the west wind blow you into the pond! Let the autumn rain erode your useless body! The world no longer needs you!"

I do not sympathize with its unfortunate fate, nor do I sigh for its destiny, because this is as it should be! When a leaf is old and withered, what use is it to people, to the world?

Everything useless and decaying should be destroyed! Let the new rise to replace it!

Therefore, I also hate those leaves that have withered but have not yet fallen, because they hinder the growth of the new generation. But I know that when the west wind blows again, after many times of wind and rain, they will no longer exist in this world; I also know that in the days when the cold is coming to an end, the new generation will sprout green shoots, and they will rule the entire earth when spring arrives!

One. Monkey and Parrot

On a golden perch, the parrot is practicing speaking.

The monkey is annoyed by its noise and gets angry: "All day long, cackling and chattering, showing off that you can speak human language, but you don't even look in the mirror. Do you look even remotely like a human?"

"Hmph! Even if you have three parts resemblance to a human," the green parrot opened its red beak, "be careful not to get too carried away, or your tail will be revealed!"

Two. Street Singer

Amidst the mournful sound of strings, the singing maiden embraced her pipa once more.

"Ah! Young lady, please don't play the same old tune again; please change it!"

Three. Lampshade

The light from the lamp was too dim, so she changed the deep purple lampshade to a onion green one. But it still didn't seem brighter.

Silly child, why not change the wick?

Four. Dewdrops

Don't look down on the dewdrops on the branches and leaves of flowers and plants at dawn. You must know that many beautiful flowers and evergreen pines cannot do without their nurturing and moisturizing.

### The Enemy (9)

— Pearl S. Buck, translated by Song Qi

So, with the most simple and precise cuts, the bullet was quickly removed. The man shuddered, but he was still unconscious. However, he still murmured a few words in English.

He muttered, as if he couldn't breathe: "Courage, they make me… not courageous…"

Hana cried sharply, "Sadao!"

Sadao said, "Don't make a sound."

The man fell back into a deep silence, and Sadao grabbed his wrist. He hated to touch this hand. Yes, the pulse, though barely perceptible, very weak, held great hope of survival if he wanted this man to live.

He thought: "But I really don't want this man to live."

He said to Hana, "Don't use any more anesthetic."

Without stopping, he turned around, picked up a small vial, filled a syringe, and injected it into the patient's left arm. Putting down the needle, he picked up the man's wrist again. Under his fingers, the pulse beat once or twice, then became stronger.

He sighed and said to Hana, "This man will live."

The young man woke up, very weak. When he saw where he was, the fear expressed in his blue eyes made Hana feel compelled to apologize to him. She personally took care of him, because none of the servants dared to enter the room.

When she first came in, she saw him gathering all his weak strength, preparing for some terrible event to come.

She asked him softly, "Don't be afraid."

He gasped, "How... do you speak English?"

She replied, "I lived in America for a long time."

She saw that he wanted to say more, but didn't have the strength, so she knelt down and gently fed him with a porcelain spoon. Although he was reluctant, he ate it.

"You will get stronger," she said, although she didn't like him, she felt compelled to comfort him after seeing him in such a weak state.

He did not answer.

On the third day after the operation, Sadao came in. He saw that the young man had sat up, his face pale from exertion.

Sadao shouted, "Lie down, do you want to die?"

After gently but firmly forcing the man to lie down, he looked at the wound again. He rebuked him, "Doing this is just trying to kill yourself."

The boy stammered, "What are you going to do with me? Are you going to turn me over to the police?" He now looked only about seventeen years old.

Sadao waited a long time without answering him. He finished examining the wound and covered him with the silk quilt again.

### Contributions from the Small Teachers' Union

— Han Da

Although the Shanghai Primary School Teachers' Joint Training Association has only been established for a few months, it has already achieved some significant successes. Among them, the following are worth mentioning:

(1) Cooperation among Teachers. Among the teachers of a certain school, there were five or six who were usually not only outwardly friendly but inwardly discordant, full of mutual suspicion and jealousy, wishing for nothing more than to see others make a mess, so that they would feel comfortable. Later, one of them, through the introduction of a friend, came to the Training Association to listen to a lecture and was actually greatly moved. The second week, he asked two colleagues who were outwardly friendly but inwardly discordant to go and listen to the lecture together. They also received a lot of spiritual encouragement and common sense enlightenment, and they realized their past mistakes, apologized to each other, and became friends. Now, those five or six "enemies" have all become members, reporting to the members their former misery and their current new life of mutual help. All the members listened and were happy for them. This is simply like the most powerful testimony in a Christian revival meeting. According to the members of the association, there have been several such testimonies. Although I am not a primary school teacher, nor a member, just a lecturer at the Joint Training Association, I couldn't help but get excited after hearing such testimony. I feel that even if the Joint Training Association has no other contributions, being able to encourage colleagues in the member schools to cooperate sincerely for the sake of education, this alone is enough to prove that such a small teachers' organization is worth advocating.

(2) Communication between Principals and Teachers. Generally speaking, teachers and principals seem to always stand in opposing positions. It's either the principal is dissatisfied with the teachers, or the teachers are saying bad things about the principal. Because of the different positions of the two sides, everyone wears a pair of prejudiced and taboo blue glasses, resulting in heavy barriers, making it impossible to understand the other party's true intentions, and even misinterpreting good intentions as bad intentions. This is really an unfortunate thing between principals and teachers. Last month, two members specifically came to see me, saying that their principal was very unreasonable and had issued a notice in the school, ordering all grade-level teachers to stay at school for an hour after school to be responsible for guiding remedial classes. Most of the teachers were unwilling to do so and wanted to oppose it; but they did not dare to act rashly, so they came to seek my opinion. After I asked in detail, I learned that the principal opened the remedial classes because the students' level was too low, so as to avoid students being held back, and the tuition fees paid by the remedial students were completely distributed to the supervising teachers. In this case, the principal is really a good principal who is enthusiastic about education and selfless. Why should they oppose him? His only criticism is that he did not tell the teachers the importance of the remedial classes beforehand, so he did not get the understanding and cooperation of the teachers. However, since the principal has issued a notice, the teachers should comply. This is the teacher's responsibility and the teacher's obligation. All teachers who have studied educational administration and teaching methods should understand this principle. The two teachers were very aware of the big picture, and went back to advise the remaining grade-level teachers to participate in the remedial work together. Because of this incident, several principals strongly supported the Small Teachers' Union, not only encouraging their teachers to participate, but also following the teachers to listen to the lectures themselves. One principal even said to the teachers: "You all go to participate, and the membership fees will all be paid by me." The teachers were very excited and said a lot of grateful words to others, and also praised their principal as being wise. Do you think these teachers would not cooperate with the principal?

### Echoing the Moral Rejuvenation Movement

— Dan Qiu

Editor: Your newspaper's high call for a moral rejuvenation movement is a life-saving remedy aimed at the current social situation. After today's appeal, all sectors of society will surely awaken as if they heard an alarm. However, to ensure its effectiveness, it must be promoted in the right way and with perseverance. Otherwise, after today's advocacy, it will soon seem like it never happened. I think moral rejuvenation should be carried out in both active and passive ways. The active aspect is nothing more than the establishment of moral standards. We have already had many immortal works from sages of past generations to instruct us, and our Father of the Nation and Chairman have made concise outlines, such as: "loyalty, filial piety, benevolence, love, trustworthiness, righteousness, peace" "understand propriety, know shame, take responsibility, obey discipline," and other key points to warn us as the guidelines for our thoughts and actions. We only need to review and reflect on them from time to time. However, in the passive aspect, we must clearly distinguish right from wrong, promote good and suppress evil, without any pretense, so that the good will naturally flourish, and the evil will naturally be suppressed. As for the method, I think the most important thing at present is to combat traitors. We must verbally attack and write against the many traitors of the past eight years, so that they have nowhere to hide, and the public's advance and retreat will be clear at a glance. This is the first step in revitalizing morality. I wonder what you think?

(Editor's note) Your opinion is very good. I believe that the key to revitalizing morality lies in practice, not in empty talk. I hope everyone knows that respecting morality is the first creed of being human, that words and deeds should be consistent, and that what is said should be done. If I can respect morality myself, I will also persuade others to respect morality in the same way. If it is promoted, it will definitely be effective. As for political matters, I think it is best to talk less about them. I would like to discuss more substantive issues that serve society, so as to fulfill our duty. (Editor)
