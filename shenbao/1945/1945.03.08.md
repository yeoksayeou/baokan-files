### Fierce Battle for Positions Near Montalban, Luzon; Japanese Air Force Bombs Enemy Positions in Leyte

Luzon Front, 7th (Central News Agency) - The enemy near Montalban is constructing positions in front of the Japanese army. The Japanese side has repeatedly attacked bravely, seizing some of the enemy's positions. The enemy forces also attacked the Japanese army, engaging in a battle for positions. On the 4th, the enemy attacked the Japanese positions with three mortars, but the Japanese side repelled them. The enemy forces are currently gradually expanding their heavy artillery positions. In Caloocan north of Manila, the northern airfield of Manila, and northwest of Novaliches, and Kuba E-Wu-Gan east of Manila, there are many stray shells of 15cm to 20cm constantly bombarding the Japanese positions. Furthermore, the enemy's artillery fire and bombing near the Japanese army's right flank position, Ande Bao, is gradually intensifying. A formal large-scale defense battle is about to begin. There are no major changes on other fronts. On the south bank of Laguna de Bay in the Kalangla area, both sides are still engaged in fierce fighting. On the northern front, on the afternoon of the 3rd, two companies of the enemy attacked the Japanese position in St. Michael, 30 kilometers east of San Fabian, but were repelled. Otherwise, there are no new developments.

On the 4th, with more than ten tanks and 600 infantry, they attacked the Japanese army's right flank position, but were bravely repelled by the Japanese army. The Japanese army is now shortening the battle lines, and soldiers are engaging in bayonet charges. The enemy's artillery fire on the Japanese army's central strongholds is extremely fierce, with shrapnel and smoke covering the military positions. The Japanese army and navy are closely cooperating to maintain the main positions. A part of the enemy forces broke into the right flank position on the 4th, but were severely defeated and retreated by the Japanese army. On the 5th, the enemy forces used flamethrowers and white phosphorus incendiary bombs on the Japanese army's right flank and central strongholds, attempting to break through the positions but failed. The Clark Field airfield currently has two B24 enemy planes, twelve medium-sized planes, thirty small planes, and two transport planes. The Japanese Air Force, in response to the enemy's ground operations, launched an air raid on the airfield at dawn on the 5th, destroying five supply depots.

Editorial

### The Case of the Black Hat Killing a Traveler

On March 4th, a black hat at the North Station, Jiang Shiyan, brutally beat a traveler, Xu Xuiwen, causing serious injuries and a tragic death. The deceased's family has entrusted a lawyer to file a lawsuit, and the perpetrator's crime will be punished by law. In order to understand the truth about the black hat's violence, we sent a reporter to observe the situation on the ground. (The current situation is recorded in this Japanese edition.) At the same time, we read the report from the deceased's family to the Zhenjiang Fellow Association, recounting the circumstances of the beating to death, and we are outraged by the black hat's disregard for the law. We believe that not only should the perpetrator be punished for his crime, but the manager of the black hats, who usually fails to supervise properly, cannot shirk responsibility. This is the first point.

The arrogance and recklessness of the black hats at the station has long been criticized by society. This is by no means society being overly critical of the black hats, but rather the result of the black hats' own brutal behavior making them the target of public condemnation. However, past social criticism has not caused the black hats to restrain themselves and learn from their mistakes. This time, the tragic case of the traveler Xu being beaten to death further proves the black hats' increasingly intensified violence. However, the black hats' identity is ultimately a kind of station servant. Why do they dare to act so recklessly, why do they dare to disregard the law so much? We believe that this is due to the connivance and indulgence of those who manage the black hats. More strictly speaking, the collusion between the managers and the black hats is the reason why the black hats are so arrogant and feel they have nothing to fear. Therefore, the managers cannot shirk responsibility for the black hats' illegal behavior. This is the first point.

Black hats are a type of employee of the Central China Railway Company. Since the black hats' illegal behavior has been criticized by society, why has the railway authority turned a deaf ear to the employees' illegal behavior and failed to rectify it? If the China Railway Authority could value public opinion and rectify the black hats earlier, then this Xu case would never have happened. The China Railway Authority is willing to damage its entire reputation for the illegal behavior of the station servants, which is truly perplexing. This is the second point.

This time, the Xu case, we believe, is not only a criminal issue between Jiang Shiyan and Xu, nor is it only a matter of the Zhenjiang Fellow Association advocating justice for the victimized fellow villager, but rather a problem of the dispute between the entire black hat and the traveler, as well as a problem of the integrity of the entire railway transportation, and even a serious social problem. If Jiang Shiyan cannot be brought to justice and punished, if the black hats cannot be rectified as soon as possible, then railway transportation will be regarded as a daunting journey, and the railway will be no different from a thorny path. May I ask, what is the mission of the railway? What is the meaning of facilitating travel? Those who bear the responsibility of managing the railway cannot easily let it go. This is the third point.

Currently, we are in a decisive battle period, and the railway bears the heavy responsibility of transportation. If the railway managers cannot rectify the servants under their command, such as the black hats, then can they be competent for the heavy responsibility of wartime transportation, can they fulfill their duties? We really cannot help but express our doubts.

Moreover, the current municipal government is actively carrying out the evacuation of the population. The most important thing in the evacuation process is transportation. Railway transportation is of course the most important item in the evacuation work. The authorities hope that the citizens will automatically evacuate and allow those who evacuate to have convenience in travel. Now, Xu is following the orders of the authorities to automatically evacuate, but is brutally beaten to death by the station servants, which has a great negative impact on the evacuation work. We have long advocated that if the railway authorities cannot rectify the black hats, then the municipal authorities and even the central authorities must intervene in order to implement improved transportation, and cannot allow corruption to continue. We hope that the municipal authorities and the department in charge of construction will urge the railway authorities to rectify the station black hats, and we also hope that the railway authorities will quickly rejuvenate themselves, value public opinion, and, in addition to arresting the perpetrators of the Xu case and handing them over for prosecution, will thoroughly rectify the black hats, eliminate the bad elements, re-train them, and save the reputation of the railway.

### Japanese Elite Air Force Active on the Burmese Front; Nighttime Surprise Attack on Enemy Rear Bases

It has been ten months since they broke through the Chongqing-Burma border at Wan Ting. During this period, they engaged in fierce battles with the elite Japanese army. This superior Chongqing army has been consumed by the Japanese army's brave and skilled bloody warfare, and the entire army is exhausted.

Nanjing, 7th (Central News Agency) - A reporter recently visited the newly appointed Director Xiao Shuxuan regarding his opinion on the Capital Maintenance of Discipline Committee.

### A Glimpse of the Black Hats' Power

— Xi

After reading the news in the newspaper the day before yesterday that "Black Hat Jiang Shiyan Beat Traveler Xu Xuiwen to Death," I was very surprised. How could black hats dare to act so recklessly? Therefore, it aroused my motivation to go and explore the truth. Yesterday morning, I rushed to the North Station and walked to the eaves of the ticket office. Only a little more than ten feet away from the ticket office, people were shouting, cursing, and jostling against each other. The black hats walked on the wooden fence, looking down from above as if facing a great enemy, waving their ruthless leather belts, directly striking the travelers' heads, faces, shoulders, and backs indiscriminately. The travelers were screaming and struggling. Some felt hats and top hats were thrown two or three feet away from the crowd. People's faces were beaten until they turned green and purple. I saw an old man in his sixties who was already within the range of this whip's power. No matter where he dodged, there were people everywhere. He could neither move forward nor get out of the line. It was pitiful that he had worked so hard to reach the ticket window, but under the brute force of the leather belt, he had to abandon his original purpose and try to escape. But since he had arrived here, regardless of whether he could buy a ticket or not, the blood on his face was finally beaten out.

I stood in a high place, calmly and clearly watching what tricks were being played in this sea of people. At this time, I turned my eyes to the ticket window, and there was still a black hat squatting there with his feet straddling the wooden fences on both sides. His two hands were using the leather belt to beat the people below him. After the people were beaten and retreated one or two steps, this black hat lowered his head, reached out to the ticket window, and bought three or five tickets at a time. Another black hat was colluding with him, helping each other, to prevent the travelers from approaching the window. He not only used the leather belt to beat them hard, but also kicked and shoved them indiscriminately. People were angrily cursing, dodging, and pushing. At this moment, the black hat bought tickets again and again, and bought them for more than a quarter of an hour. The tickets for various stations must have all been bought. According to my estimates, this person bought at least more than thirty tickets. This is a very alarming number, but I turned my gaze to the sign next to the ticket window that read "One ticket limit per person," and could not help but be stunned. When this black hat bought enough and jumped down triumphantly, the window was immediately closed, and the black curtains were ruthlessly lowered. The sound of "Sold out," "Sold out" was still vaguely transmitted from inside the window. At this time, the remaining black hats and the station police also left triumphantly, leaving behind only those legitimate ticket buyers who were reluctant to leave. According to several people in front of the window, we have been running to buy tickets for four consecutive days. Today, it was hard to be at the very front. I had waited all night since 8:00 PM the night before in the cold wind below zero, and my body was frozen stiff and numb. However, from the opening of the ticket window, I watched helplessly as one black hat after another bought tickets. They could never buy a ticket, and being beaten was unavoidable. The black hats beat others and enriched themselves. At this moment, I discovered that humans were so cruel. On the way home, I silently pondered this case of the black hat beating a traveler to death. It was not an exaggerated report, and society's condemnation of the black hats was not excessive. I wonder what the authorities think about this?

### Forcibly Crossing the Rhine: A Major Battle to Commence; Anglo-American Encirclement Plan Fails

Berlin, 7th (Central News Agency dispatch) - A Reuters report states: German forces continue to bravely engage in rear-guard actions along the Rhine River, preventing enemy troops from crossing. To date, the enemy has not been able to reach the entirety of the riverbank, greatly hindering the progress of their offensive. Although the main force of the German army has retreated to the east bank, German divisions or corps continue to fight on the west bank. Enemy reports acknowledge the failure of the plan to encircle the industrial area. While it seems inevitable that small units of German troops will be trapped, no large units have yet been encircled. It is expected that the upcoming battle will be the second phase of Eisenhower's offensive, primarily focused on forcibly crossing the Rhine River.

Fierce Street Fighting in Cologne - Berlin, 7th (Central News Agency dispatch) - A Reuters report states: The wide lower reaches of the Rhine River have become the most formidable natural obstacle for Anglo-American forces since landing. Fierce fighting is currently underway in the ruins of Cologne. Enemy troops have penetrated the west railway station and the inner circle of the city. German forces are putting up strong resistance against enemy tanks. The German bridgehead in Düsseldorf is under heavy bombardment from enemy artillery and aircraft, but the situation remains largely unchanged. Near Euskirchen, German forces are being pushed back westward towards the road to Rheinbach. Although fierce fighting continues in the lower reaches of the Rhine, the anti-Axis forces have been unable to achieve their objective of annihilating German forces on the west bank. The fighting south of the lower Rhine is only of a local nature.

### Pomerania: Fluid Warfare Intensifies; Soviet Forces Advance Towards Cammin

Berlin, 7th (Central News Agency dispatch) - A Reuters report states: The activities of Soviet forces in Pomerania and West Prussia indicate that a major offensive is imminent. Fluid warfare is intense between the Warta and Vistula rivers. The Soviet offensive from Arnswalde and Kallies has stalled. Fierce fighting has erupted as Soviet forces advance from Neustettin and other locations. Soviet tank units have occupied Köslin and are advancing towards Cammin. Intense fluid warfare is taking place in central Pomerania.

Berlin, 7th (Central News Agency dispatch) - A Reuters report states: Soviet forces are reorganizing their units between Görlitz and Lauban, and between Obernigk and Ostrau, preparing to launch a new offensive. In the past 24 hours, Soviet aircraft have heavily bombed Breslau, but infantry attacks have been on a small scale.

### Finnish President Mannerheim Ailing; Refrains from Governing; Contains Political Implications

Stockholm, 7th (Central News Agency dispatch) - A German News Agency report from Helsinki states: Finnish President Marshal Mannerheim is ill, and his duties have been assumed by Prime Minister Paasikivi in accordance with the constitution. On Monday, the president informed the Finnish government through the Minister of Justice that he would be unable to perform his duties from Monday until further notice. The news of the president's illness has caused significant unrest in the Finnish capital.

Further report: Well-informed sources in Stockholm believe that the news of Marshal Mannerheim's illness is politically motivated. Mannerheim may resign from the presidency. Mannerheim commanded the Finnish army during the Finnish-Soviet War. He is a far-right politician and is not welcomed by Moscow.

### The European War Situation After the Three-Power Conference

The United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union have announced that they have decided to jointly fight against Germany at the Crimean Conference. However, looking at the European war situation after the conference, the biggest focus remains on the Eastern Front. The Zhukov forces on the Berlin front are advancing towards Küstrin on the right flank, and the fighting is quite active, while other areas are relatively stagnant. At the same time, the advance of Konev's forces towards Saxony and the northward advance from the west bank of the Warta River to join forces with Zhukov's forces is very active. Judging from these actions, the Soviet army seems to have no intention of attacking Berlin head-on. According to sources in Berlin, the German authorities also tend to agree with this observation. If the Soviet army avoids a frontal attack on Berlin, the reason would be that major cities can easily be turned into fortified strongholds, and the Germans will turn Berlin into a second Stalingrad. Therefore, they would rather advance deep to the north and south of the city, isolating Berlin and, if possible, encircling it. In addition, they also seem to be trying to have Konev's forces advance into Saxony, first controlling southern Germany. However, the German army detected Konev's movements early and has strengthened the front line in that area. On the 17th, a Soviet frontline report also stated: "Because the resistance of German forces on the Warta River front has been strengthened, some units of the Red Army have retreated from the west bank of the river to the east bank." A noteworthy event in this area was the large-scale bombing of Dresden, Cottbus, and other areas by the British and American air forces on the 15th. This was the first joint operation in which the British and American air forces supported the Soviet army's ground advance. The Soviet authorities announced on the 17th: "In order to ensure close cooperation between the British and American air forces and the Red Army's future offensive, air force generals from Eisenhower's headquarters have been ordered to join the Red Army's general staff and have recently arrived in Moscow." This statement is related to the aforementioned matter and strongly suggests the future direction of British and American bombing of Germany.

Secondly, although no large-scale offensive has begun on the Western Front, as per the initial plan of the Anglo-American forces, preparations are currently underway to break through the northern part of the Siegfried Line. Some believe that a landing operation on the Scandinavian Peninsula may be carried out, but due to the current shortage of ships, it is unlikely that a new operation requiring a large number of ships will be launched. If anything, it would be a landing operation on the coast of the Heligoland Bight, as there is a good chance of approaching the German heartland from there. (Special dispatch from Zurich, 18th) (Translated from the February 10th edition of the Asahi Shimbun)

### Director Dai of the Education Bureau Discusses Improving Teacher Treatment; Salaries and Benefits to be Equivalent to Civil Servants

A reporter from the Central News Agency, in order to understand the improvement in the treatment of municipal primary and secondary school teachers and staff this semester, visited Director Dai of the Education Bureau, who graciously shared his views.

Since Mayor Zhou and Secretary-General Luo took office, they have been deeply concerned about the treatment of teachers and staff and instructed me to adjust the treatment of municipal school staff and workers in accordance with the government's adjustment methods, starting this semester. After receiving the order, I immediately approved the method of paying salaries based on qualifications and determined the salary levels of teachers and staff at various schools to be equivalent to civil servants with the same salary level. For example, a high school normal school graduate who initially becomes a primary school teacher will receive the eighth-grade salary for teachers, with a base salary of 50 yuan, which is equivalent to 17,950 yuan per month for a civil servant. A university education department graduate who initially becomes a primary school teacher will receive the seventh-grade salary for teachers, with a base salary of 60 yuan, which is equivalent to 18,700 yuan per month for a civil servant. Furthermore, a graduate of the education department of a teacher's college who becomes a primary school principal will receive the seventh-grade salary for principals, with a base salary of 70 yuan, which is equivalent to 19,450 yuan per month. A newly appointed primary school principal will receive the seventh-grade salary for principals, with a base salary of 80 yuan, which is equivalent to 20,200 yuan per month. As for the teachers and staff of the former 18 district schools and the two model primary schools in the old Nanshi district, due to their long service, they have been approved to advance one or two grades in salary to general primary schools. Principals of primary schools with six grade levels may advance one grade in salary as encouragement. There are also regulations for secondary schools. The monthly salary of full-time teachers is approximately 25,000 yuan, depending on their qualifications, and starting this semester, a seniority-based salary increase system will be implemented according to the method of paying salaries based on qualifications and length of service. In the past, the salaries of municipal primary school teachers ranged from 8,000 yuan for the highest to only 2,000 yuan for the lowest. According to the current method, the average salary from February will be 18,000 yuan, an increase of approximately three to eight times. In addition to this, all municipal school teachers and staff will be exempt from special allocation of rice, which should be included in the key allocation in the future.

### Case of Young Woman Beaten to Death by Black Hat; Zhenjiang Fellow Townsmen's Association Presides Over Justice; Engages a Lawyer to Proceed with Legal Procedures

The case of Xu Xupingwen, a young woman from Zhenjiang, who was brutally beaten at the North Railway Station on the 4th of this month by Jiang Shiyan, a black-hat employee of the Ye Zhong Railway Company, was reported in yesterday's newspaper. After receiving a report from her family, the Shanghai Fellow Townsmen's Association of Zhenjiang was extremely indignant. They unanimously believed that the black hats of the railway were acting lawlessly, committing murder in public. If they were not severely punished according to law, how could the safety of travelers be ensured and the law be maintained? In addition to submitting reports to the Municipal Government, the Local Procuratorate, and the members of the Municipal Advisory Committee, appealing for methods to apprehend the murderer, they also engaged lawyer Chen Rongfa to represent the Fellow Townsmen's Association in assisting the family of the deceased in proceeding with legal procedures. The text of the family's submission to the Fellow Townsmen's Association is excerpted below:

Family's Submission

"Tragically, Xinmao and others are originally from Zhenjiang and currently reside at No. 21, Xindexing Lane, Xinjiang Road, Zhabei District, this city. Recently, due to the dispersal of the population in Shanghai, they planned to send their mother-in-law and three-year-old daughter back to their hometown in Zhenjiang. On the morning of March 4th at 2:00 AM, they instructed their sister-in-law, Xu Peiwwen, 25 years old, to go to ticket office No. 4 at the North Railway Station to buy tickets and wait for daybreak at 7:00 AM. Unexpectedly, she was inexplicably beaten by Jiang Shiyan, a railway black hat. When the sister-in-law tried to reason, he became even more fierce and grabbed her hair, dragging her horizontally into his office, where he locked the door and savagely beat her with fists and feet, causing severe injuries all over her body. Then, the head of the assailant, Li Yixian, and Zhou Shunchu and others, without authorization, hired a car to send the sister-in-law to the Shanghai Sanatorium on Bazilu Road. At that time, although Xinshun had rushed to the scene after hearing the news, not knowing the details, he was also detained by many people, preventing him from reporting to the police, so that the murderer took the opportunity to escape, which is extremely hateful. Later, after the doctor's diagnosis, it was found that the injuries were too severe and very dangerous. After performing an abdominal surgery to remove the kidney, it was found to have been beaten into two pieces. She tragically passed away at 1:45 AM on March 5th. At that time, the North Railway Station branch bureau had received the report, but because the murderer had escaped, they could not be apprehended. They then requested the Huazhong Railway Authority to hand over the guarantor of the murderer, but to no avail. The bureau then dispatched personnel to detain Li Yixian, Zhou Shunchu, and others who had instigated the murderer and investigated day and night, but to no effect. Xinmao and others were faced with the tragedy of family destruction and death when the dispersal failed. If the murderer is allowed to remain at large, how can the wronged soul be appeased? Therefore, we plead and earnestly request your Fellow Townsmen's Association, based on its position of upholding the interests of fellow townsmen, to uphold justice and appeal to all circles to rise up and lend their support, to ensure that the murderer is brought to justice to comfort the wronged soul and revitalize discipline. We anxiously await your decision. Xu Xinmao, Shun respectfully present."

### Chongqing's Reliance on Britain and America Will Lead to Tragedy; Minister Ide Reveals Enemy America's Ambitions

The Allied Japanese Army News Department held a regular news conference at Hamilton House yesterday (the 7th) at 3:00 PM. Minister Ide attended and elaborated on America's ambitions toward Chongqing, stating that their intentions would cause Chongqing to suffer a tragic fate in great detail. The following is a record of his speech:

Enemy America Plans to Increase War Expenditure

The minister began by saying: Recently, enemy America has planned to increase war expenditures against Japan, create a Pacific Air Force, strengthen Pacific air defense supply bases, hold Pacific war zone conferences, and establish a Pacific Front Command, etc., demonstrating its active approach to the war against Japan. Enemy America is also increasing its encouragement of Chongqing, because the Japanese army's operations on the Chinese mainland, since occupying Guilin, have formed a connected continental posture, making the East Asian war situation increasingly worse. However, the formation of the above situation is due to the chaos of Chongqing's military and political affairs and the lack of cooperation between the Kuomintang and the Communists. Therefore, Chongqing's responsibility in East Asia needs to be re-examined. Now, America is contacting Yan'an on the one hand and adopting a policy of reconciliation with Chongqing to deal with Japan on the other, providing Chongqing with economic assistance with the goal of increasing military supplies.

Cooperation with Chongqing Interferes with Internal Affairs

However, America's cooperation with Chongqing and interference in its internal affairs is nothing more than manipulating Chongqing. The Chongqing regime has always been deluded by the dream of relying on Britain and America, believing in the propaganda that enemy forces are victorious in the Philippines, and thinking that the defeat of the Japanese army is imminent. They have mistakenly resisted Japan, causing the people to suffer for eight years. Currently, Chongqing is planning to use the Chinese mainland as a battlefield for the post-Philippine victory against Japan. This is the highest point of Chongqing's reliance on Britain and America. However, Chongqing scolds [Chiang Kai-shek] for being obsessed with British and American policies, which is the tragedy of the Chongqing regime. Chongqing also hopes to rely on Britain and America to clean up the domestic mess after the victory of the anti-Axis powers. Look at the situation of small countries after being occupied or managed by the British and American empires. For example, the Badoglio regime initially planned to surrender to Britain and America to obtain liberation, but unexpectedly entered the entanglement of the three countries. Moreover, in southern Italy under anti-Axis occupation, there is widespread hunger, unemployment, crime, and prostitution. Poland has become a living drama of the struggle for power among the three countries. Unless Poland acts as a defeated country, there is no other way. Furthermore, the internal strife in Greece, the riots in Bulgaria, the predicament of France, etc., make it easy to see the dead end of relying on the anti-Axis powers without one's own strength.

Britain and America Have Many Internal Difficulties

Britain and America also have many internal problems, such as the sluggishness of military production and the difficulty of replenishing manpower, which are very serious. In particular, the lack of human resources in the United States has created a huge potential crisis for the future of military production. The United States, in view of the tense situation in the Western European war and the bloody battle of the Japanese army in East Asia, the more human resources are consumed and the more difficult it is to extend the supply line, so it applies fourth-F-class (weak) people to war.

Britain and America have always incited other countries through charitable undertakings or the quality production of money and goods, etc., to achieve their own interests. Now Chongqing overestimates Britain and America, and the result will be a tragic tragedy, sharing the same fate as the small countries of Europe. According to the lessons of history, the survival of a nation depends on the unity of the same nation and the effort to regenerate, which determines its future and destiny.
