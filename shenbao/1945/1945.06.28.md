### Balikpapan Reduced to Scorched Earth; Japanese Garrison Prepares to Ambush; Three Enemy Vessels, Including a Warship, Sunk Offshore

From a Certain Southern Base, 27th (Central News Agency Telegram) – On the 25th, at dusk, a Japanese army air force attack squadron launched a resolute and fierce assault on enemy naval forces operating off the coast of Balikpapan, sinking two cruisers and one cruiser or destroyer. In addition, a large 20,000-ton oil tanker was also hit.

From a Southwestern Pacific Base, 27th (Central News Agency Telegram) – Balikpapan, the famous and charming city cherished by the Japanese, has also suffered continuous bombing by the enemy for twenty days. Having previously endured ten days of naval bombardment, the area has already been completely reduced to a scorched battlefield. The enemy's scorched-earth tactics have long been anticipated. When enemy ships first appeared off the coast of Balikpapan at noon on the 15th, the Japanese garrison, prepared for an ambush and awaiting the moment to strike, along with the fiercely fighting National Volunteer Corps, bravely stepped forward to fight alongside them under heavy enemy bombardment, forming an organized force. The residents, seeking shelter, also largely cooperated in transporting important supplies to the garrison amidst the enemy aircraft's strafing, proceeding without the slightest negligence in an atmosphere of extreme tension. Every day, from 9:00 AM to 3:00 PM, enemy aircraft frequently launch wave-like air raids, and transportation is carried out during this time. Enemy naval bombardment has become a daily routine. The Japanese artillery, steadfastly defending their positions under enemy bombardment, display a courageous spirit, determined to sacrifice themselves ten to one if the enemy lands. Furthermore, the presence of the highest commander directing operations at the front greatly inspires all soldiers. Although enemy aircraft and warships increase in number and more troops land, the Japanese garrison anticipates this, aiming to annihilate them in one fell swoop and thwart their plans. The brave and heroic spirit of the soldiers fighting in the scorched earth commands respect.

### Recent Situation in Wuxi

— Xiang Piao

Important Town Between Nanjing and Shanghai

Wuxi County is located at the heart of the Nanjing-Shanghai railway line, bordering Changshu to the east, Taihu Lake to the south, and connecting with Wuxian County, bordering Yixing and Wujin to the west, and connecting with Jiangyin to the north. The county is mostly flat terrain, with many streams, making it unsuitable for defense. Huishan Mountain, located outside the city, is only suitable for scenery and has no strategic importance. However, since the Nanjing-Shanghai railway line was built, Wuxi has become a transportation hub between Nanjing and Shanghai. As a result, the population is dense. The county has a total area of 3,650 square li. Silk and mulberry farming is developed, and industry and commerce are the best in the counties, hence the name "Little Shanghai". In terms of transportation, there are canals and Taihu Lake by waterway, and expressways such as Xihu, Xicheng, Xiyi, and Suxi highways connect neighboring counties, so Wuxi is indeed a transportation and industrial and commercial center in Jiangsu Province.

Population of One Million

According to the latest survey, the total population of the county has slightly increased compared to before the Incident, but detailed population statistics before the Incident are not available. The county is currently divided into ten districts, eighty-one towns, and one hundred and twenty-six townships, totaling 2,027 pao, 23,814 jia, 249,071 households, and 1,119,145 people, of which there are more than 102,000 able-bodied men, accounting for 9.20% of the total.

Changing Diet to Mixed Grains

Wuxi has convenient transportation and universal education, so the customs can be called docile. However, in recent years, due to the influence of Shanghai customs, things have become extravagant, and weddings, funerals, and celebrations all value vanity, which is a lot of unnecessary waste. In terms of life, the wealthy families are of course fine. The farmers in the countryside, the self-cultivating farmers are barely warm and full, the semi-self-cultivating farmers have difficulty making ends meet, and the tenant farmers do not even have enough to eat. In the past, regardless of the rich or the poor, rice was the staple food. Recently, affected by the soaring price of rice, the general middle and lower classes mostly eat mixed grains, or change to one meal and two bowls of porridge. The dishes are heavily sweetened, and the cooking skills are comparable to those of Suzhou and Wuxi. The clothes are silk and cloth, and the houses are all tile-roofed houses, and thatched houses are occasionally inhabited by guest people.

Brothels

The city is a distribution center for goods from all over the world, and there are many factories. Before the Incident, many silk and cloth factories were opened, which could accommodate a large number of female workers. However, after the Incident, the factories stopped, and life became difficult. It was not easy for the female workers to make a living, and they could not avoid becoming prostitutes. After rectification by the authorities, there are still more than 250 singers and prostitutes.

Prosperous Market

The city is eighteen miles around, bordering the canal, and is traversed by the Nanjing-Shanghai railway. The prosperity of industry and commerce is the best in the counties. The most prosperous street is North Gate Street, followed by Da Shi Bridge, Hui Bridge, Qingming Bridge, Huangni Peak, and West Gate Suspension Bridge, which are also bustling. The rice and wheat market is concentrated in Beitang. The Yun, Hanchang, and other roads have developed by forcing the train and boat docks, and factories are mostly located in the West Gate, while warehouses are scattered on both sides of the river. Whenever there are rice and silkworm cocoon markets, the trade merchants are extremely crowded.

Social Welfare

The people of Wuxi are very enthusiastic about charitable causes. Every winter, in view of the hunger and cold of the general poor people, there are often winter porridge distributions, or methods are devised to sell rice at a fair price to provide relief. Since the Incident, everything has been devastated, and the suffering of the displaced people is even worse than before. Fortunately, various charitable organizations have organized charity relief, and the poor people have benefited a lot.

The Middle Education Daoyi Society in Beizhakou, Wuxi, has been organizing various charitable causes over the years, all of which are beneficial to the society and have contributed to the local area. Since the welcoming of the sun, the price of rice has soared. The branch association has seen this and, in the midst of great difficulties, continued to launch the fair sale of flour to relieve the poor.

Developed Education

Wuxi is one of the counties with developed culture in Jiangsu. Primary school education is the most prevalent. There are 48 county-run primary schools in the entire county (a list of renovated districts), with a total of 17,260 students and 468 teachers and staff. There are 7 county-run primary schools in rural areas, distributed in Dongting, Changan, Zhangjing, Anzhen, Dangkou, Qianzhou, and Xinlian, with a total of 2,079 students and 56 teachers and staff. There are also 9 county-run private secondary schools, with 2,633 students and 156 teachers and staff. In addition, there are also public education facilities such as people's education halls and libraries.

As for the treatment of teachers, although it has been raised again and again, the cost of living is rising day by day. By the time the budget is finalized, prices have already risen several times. This is why the life of teachers has always been difficult. Recently, the price of rice has exceeded a major level. The meager treatment of salaried employees means that even their own hunger cannot be satisfied, especially for primary school teachers. Although the authorities are trying their best to maintain the life of teachers, such as the new budget, rice distribution, and wartime living allowances, in fact, the new budget has not been established, the old budget is two months in arrears, the rice has not been received, and the allowances are uncertain. The salary of a primary school teacher is no more than 2,000 yuan per month. Although the authorities want to rectify it, they feel that they are powerless, which led to a county-wide teacher strike last month. The Standing Committee has now established a County Education Workers' Life Relief Committee to raise a large-scale "Education Workers' Relief Fund", aiming for ten million yuan, which is a small help for the current life of county education workers. However, for the long-term plan, there should be more perfect measures.

The inferiority of teachers is due to the poor living treatment, which leads to the escape of excellent teachers. This is only half the reason, and the main reason is the lack of teachers.

Industry and Commerce

Wuxi has a prosperous education, and talents emerge in large numbers. Scholars and entrepreneurs have their own people. Industrial education and public undertakings are all considerable. Before the Incident, Wuxi and Nantong were known as two model autonomous counties.

Wuxi is known as Little Shanghai, and the development of industry is known. Silk factories, cotton spinning factories, cotton weaving factories, knitting factories, flour factories, oil pressing factories, rice milling factories, etc. are available, and the number of male and female workers reaches 100,000, of which the cotton spinning industry is the largest, followed by the flour industry. Other new industries such as magnesium production, electricity, and printing, and old industries or handicrafts, include woodenware, ironware, pastries, and gluten. Other products such as Huishan clay figurines, Dongting string money and playing cards, Tangxu Town silk threads and yellow grass cloth, Qingming Bridge bricks and tiles, and Southeast Township mats, Huilong Bridge bamboo ware, etc., are now in slow sales, resulting in less output.

Commerce is also very developed. Wuxi County is a major distribution center for rice and silk. In addition to trains and long-distance buses, there are also small-wheel routes with Wuxi County as the center, with Shanghai, Suzhou, Changzhou, Jiangyin, Liyang, Huzhou, and other places all having contacts. The rice market is the most prosperous. The rice from Wujin, Yixing, Liyang, and Anhui provinces is concentrated here and transported to Suzhou, Shanghai, Zhejiang, and other places, so the rice price in Changde is about half of that in Shanghai. The second is silk. There are no less than 100 silk cocoon firms in the entire city. In addition to supplying the city, they are also transported to Shanghai, so the market situation is very prosperous.

Comforting Work

Since the Xiantian Dao began its activities in the Wuxi-Wucheng-Yu area, it has been more than four months. The general farmers mistakenly believe that they are invulnerable to swords and guns, and freely say that the Buddha's power protects the family, which wastes time and causes unemployment, and hinders local security. In order to take care of the people's livelihood and prevent the expansion of the situation, the government authorities resolutely detained 13 important members of the Xiantian Dao, and organized a bandit suppression headquarters by the Provincial Security Command to carry out comforting work, and after repeated explanations, they generally corrected their evil ways and handed over all the broadswords, spears, and guns for conversion into agricultural tools. There are still a small number of Taoist followers who exist in remote townships. They are worried that their personal lives will not be guaranteed after the weapons are handed over, fearing retaliation from the guerrillas and illegal military police.

Agricultural Production Increase

The soil is fertile, with high heat and heavy rainfall in summer, and low temperatures and dryness in winter, making it the most suitable place for cultivating rice and wheat. Therefore, wheat is the main crop in this county. In addition, breeding and raising fish are also the two major side industries in the county's rural areas. The annual output of dry silkworms is about 47,000 dan, and the output of fish is about 15,000 dan. The spring silkworm breeding this year has been smooth with the weather, and the development of silkworm larvae has been quite good, with very few cases of disease, and the rural economy has been slightly revived by this side industry. After the farmers in the four townships sell the fresh silkworms, the economy is lively. In addition, after breeding silkworms, mulberry bark is also a byproduct, and foreign firms in Changde are all eager to buy it for use as textile raw materials, making a lot of profit. Recently, farmers in the four townships have been engaged in mowing wheat and transplanting rice, and the work is quite tense.

Horticultural crops such as water chestnut and watermelon are also exported to Suzhou and Shanghai. The tea from Xuelang Mountain is famous for its excellent quality. There are very few minerals, and only the pottery clay produced in the southwest can be used to make tiles and all daily necessities. Aquatic products are rare, and the whitefish and silverfish in Taihu Lake are the most famous.

To increase agricultural production, the county has established an "Agricultural Production Increase Promotion Committee" as the central agency for promoting agricultural production increase in the county. Other agricultural improvement zones, the Wuxi branch of the Chinese Cooperative Society, and all other agencies for increasing production are implementation agencies, but the funds of each agency are limited, so they have not been fully realized.

The annual production increase plan is roughly divided into: land reclamation, to remove ground obstacles and then sow soil. Utilizing vacant land along the railway line to sow sweet potatoes, corn, jute, and vegetables. Establishing demonstration and contract farms in the first, sixth, seventh, and eighth districts as a demonstration of six crops such as rice, wheat, and sweet potatoes. Holding cultivation improvement guidance and reward projects in the seventh, eighth, and ninth districts, including seedling bed improvement, seed selection improvement, and fertilizer improvement. Pest control. Improving wheat production guidance and reward projects. Increasing production of handicrafts, vegetables, etc. Sweet potato cultivation, jute promotion, setting up cattle, pig, and sheep breeding stations, and purchasing threshing machines. Holding side business lectures and agricultural production increase instructor training.

The results of increasing production with castor cultivation are better. Last year, each mu could yield two dan, and the farmers made a good profit, so it is easier to promote this year. Recently, we are continuing to guide the sowing of miscellaneous grains and sweet potatoes, and the weeding and weeding of seedling beds, as well as wheat selection.

As for rural loans, they have not yet been carried out. Previously, only the "Waterway Fertilizer Loan" promoted by the cooperative lent agricultural tools and fertilizers to farmers, and when the harvest was in, they repaid the loan with agricultural products at market prices, which was a good result.

Editorial

### Closing of the San Francisco Conference

The much-discussed San Francisco Conference, which opened on April 25th of this year, officially closed yesterday (the 26th), lasting two months. After several perilous and near-breaking points, it finally managed to break the deadlock, thanks to the personal representatives of US President Truman, Davies and Hopkins, who traveled to London and Moscow for persuasion. On the 13th of this month, the charter of the new international organization, known as the "United Nations," was completed. According to San Francisco reports, the new charter was formally approved by the United Nations General Assembly in San Francisco on the 25th of this month and immediately telegraphed to the capitals of the 50 participating countries for ratification. On the 26th, the representatives of each country formally signed the charter. In the afternoon, President Truman delivered the closing remarks, declaring the conference closed.

With the establishment of the new international organization, the "United Nations," the future task of the United Nations is, of course, the preparation for the establishment of this international organization. To this end, the San Francisco Conference has resolved to establish a Preparatory Committee of the "United Nations," which will be responsible not only for preparing for the founding assembly of the so-called "United Nations" but also for preparing for the establishment of the international organizations directly affiliated with this "United Nations," namely, the Security Council, the Secretariat, the International Court of Justice, and the Economic and Social Council. The Preparatory Committee is scheduled to convene its first meeting in San Francisco immediately after the closing of the San Francisco Conference, and then move to London. Moreover, according to the nine articles of the agreement of the Preparatory Committee passed by the San Francisco Conference, the first plenary session of the new international organization, the "United Nations," will also be convened in British territory, suggesting that the focus of future international affairs will shift back to Europe.

However, in any case, this newly established international organization, which has been greatly exaggerated, is a very imperfect and malformed institution. First, because it is entirely dominated by the so-called five major powers. A dispatch from a Japanese reporter in the Swedish capital more bluntly calls it "a worsened version of the League of Nations." Second, because it completely ignores all countries and peoples in the Pacific region, with only Chongqing and the Philippines, which certainly cannot represent all East Asian countries and peoples. The guarantee of future world peace and security obviously cannot disregard East Asia. Third, Germany and Japan, it is said, will be unable to participate in the "United Nations" with equal status for a long time, and Spain is not allowed to participate unless its political system changes. Many other neutral countries, such as Sweden and Portugal, have also not participated. No one can believe that such a narrow-minded international political institution can shoulder the heavy responsibility of guaranteeing world peace and security.

Before the new international organization, the "United Nations," has brought its international security guarantee mechanism into play, an interim executive committee has already been established, based on the decision of the San Francisco Conference, as a transitional international agency. According to U.S. Secretary of State Stettinius on the 22nd of this month, the executive committee will work in London, and the committee members will be representatives from the Soviet Union, Britain, the United States, France, Chongqing, and Iran. They will participate in the deliberation of future international issues. However, at a time when the seriousness of international issues is still on the rise, the upcoming summit will still be the first to coordinate. Therefore, today, instead of focusing on the charter passed by the San Francisco Conference and the so-called transitional mechanism of the "United Nations," it is actually better to pay attention to the summit of Stalin, Truman, and Churchill. Their greatest contradiction is that this so-called "grand declaration of world peace and security" is completely unrealistic, because Britain and the United States are still engaged in brutal massacres and destruction in East Asia, and to indulge in talk of peace and civilization is nothing short of a disgrace to humanity.

Furthermore, we recall the Treaty of Versailles signed after World War I, which not only failed to maintain world peace but became a weapon for the great powers to divide and rule the weak. The League of Nations, established based on this treaty, not only failed to guarantee international security but became a tool to protect the interests of the great powers. Therefore, we really cannot give a higher evaluation to the so-called "charter" and "security organization" that were produced with such difficulty and patched up so many times at the San Francisco Conference.

The result of concluding the Treaty of Versailles and forming the League of Nations was the creation of a fiery movement for freedom by oppressed nations two or three decades later, which led to this great war. Today, it is clear that the contradictions among the members of the United Nations are becoming increasingly sharp, as manifested in the San Francisco Conference in issues such as the Polish question and the voting rights question. As the saying goes, there are countless disputes. It is not difficult for us to imagine what kind of situation will arise in the next few years between Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union, and it is not difficult to imagine what consequences will occur between the bullied, divided, and ruled defeated nations and the great powers.

### Japanese Troops Fight Bravely on the Shitan River Line in Burma; Southern Headquarters Also Establish Strong Positions on the Plateau

Burma Frontline Base, 26th (Central News Agency dispatch) - The Japanese army in Burma is reorganizing its battle lines and has completed its regrouping. On the Shitan River line, they are resisting the British-Indian army attempting to advance eastward and are currently fighting bravely. In the Nanhui Plateau area, the eastern triangle area of Kalaw, and the Bago Yoma mountains, strong positions have been established to prevent the enemy from advancing. Currently, there are no major military clashes on the Burmese front due to the rainy season and muddy roads, with only small skirmishes between outpost troops. The enemy is attempting to advance eastward in the southern Nanhui Plateau area, obstructed by dense forests. Elite Japanese troops have repeatedly dispatched raiding parties day and night to surprise the enemy and hinder their advance. In the Irrawaddy River triangle area, southeast and northeast of Tharrawaddy, Japanese raiding parties also surprised enemy positions, inflicting heavy losses. Enemy reports also acknowledged the Japanese army's fierce battles. According to Radio New Delhi, the Tharrawaddy front is currently facing extreme difficulties due to rising water levels and intense Japanese artillery fire. A special correspondent from the United Press of India also stated that the Japanese army appeared to have established strong positions on the east bank of the Shitan River, reorganizing their weapons with excellent equipment and active powerful artillery.

### "New International Organization" - Contents of its Structure and Function -

Tokyo, 27th (Central News Agency dispatch) - The full text of the United Nations Charter was released on the 24th at the San Francisco Conference. The structure and function of the new international organization as stipulated in the Charter are as follows:

Name - "United Nations." The "United Nations" contains a completely different meaning from the past. It is not merely a group of countries fighting a common enemy but a permanent world organization for handling international issues. This organization is indeed more advanced than past international organizations. If compared with the old "League of Nations," the current organization is slightly better. Although the permanent location of the organization has not yet been decided, the location of the headquarters will be in a "transcendent zone" that does not belong to any one country, similar to world territory. Although the various organs do not all have independent status, each internal part of the organization has a clear division of responsibilities. The structure and functions of each organ are recorded below:

General Assembly

The General Assembly is composed of up to five representatives from each member state. Voting is based on one country, one vote. Countries eligible to amend the Charter are those that participated in the San Francisco Conference and ratified the Charter. The General Assembly, based on the recommendation of the Security Council, can admit new member states. Regular meetings are held once a year, but the General Assembly can also convene extraordinary meetings. The non-permanent member states of the Security Council and the members of the permanent Council of the Trusteeship Council elect the Secretary-General of the international organization, participate in the election of judges of the International Court of Justice, and review reports from other organs, discuss all international issues within the scope stipulated in the Charter, and may issue recommendations. However, it cannot participate in opinions on issues under consideration by the Security Council.

Security Council

Composed of eleven countries, including the five permanent members: Britain, the United States, the Soviet Union, Chongqing, and France. The other six countries must be selected with full consideration of their contributions to world security and geographical relations. The Council will be open for a long time, and the president will be self-elected at the meeting. If the Council encounters a matter of reconciliation and all means have failed, it can issue diplomatic or economic sanctions and request the subordinate Military Staff Committee to take action against the aggressor. The Military Committee may freely use the land, sea, and air forces of the member states. Decisions of the Council must be decided by a majority of seven countries, and important procedures must obtain unanimous agreement from all permanent members.

Economic and Social Council

The council is composed of eighteen countries elected by the General Assembly, and its purpose is to promote and improve human rights and human welfare and to seek liaison between the organs of the United Nations and various special national organs. The Council may establish a drafting committee for the International People's Charter and its necessary subcommittees, which are directly subordinate to the General Assembly.

International Trusteeship Council

The council is composed of an equal number of member states with and without trust territories. The five permanent members of the Security Council may participate in any regions, and agreements concluded later will be placed under mandate respectively. The Council may accept and review reports submitted by the governing countries, and comply with the terms of governance, assess all territories and other issues, and plan its governance matters with the establishment of people's welfare as the primary determining condition. The Council is under the jurisdiction of the General Assembly and may submit reports to the Security Council on matters relating to war security.

International Court of Justice

The court replaces the International Court of Justice in The Hague. The court also completely inherits all material assets of the Permanent Court of Arbitration. The International Court of Justice consists of fifteen elected judges, with the same powers as the old court. Countries that now want the court to have judicial power can sign a declaration in the court's current regulations, giving the court jurisdiction.

Secretariat

The Secretariat is responsible for all executive functions. Its members are not subject to the laws of individual countries. The Secretariat is headed by the Secretary-General, and the secretaries within the bureau are personally selected by the Secretary-General. The Secretary-General is designated by the Security Council and then elected by the General Assembly before a decision is made. In addition to performing his duties, the Secretary-General has the power to call the Council's attention to all situations that threaten world security and peace at any time.

Regional Agencies

In addition to the establishment of various organs designated in accordance with the Charter, it is also necessary to enable various regional organs to fully cooperate in accordance with the security system and the form of the Arab League, and the Charter specifically recognizes the value and significance of such regional organs. This new organization also has the power of self-defense against various acts of aggression at any time before the Security Council begins to intervene.

### Polish Government in Exile Issues Declaration

Stockholm, 27th (Central News Agency dispatch) - According to news received here, the Polish government in exile in London issued a declaration yesterday, and presented the declaration to the governments of the United Nations (excluding the Soviet government), strongly protesting the new Polish coalition government in Warsaw. It stated that the so-called Polish Provisional Government of National Unity is an extremely illegal organization. This illegal government should transfer all power to government authorities organized within free Polish territory and able to represent public opinion during elections. The United Nations also issued a statement indicating that the Polish Committee of National Liberation, composed of personnel from countries occupying most of Polish territory and by the ambassadors of Britain and the United States, is authorized to organize a formal government of Poland. However, the establishment of the current Polish provisional government is at a time when all Polish territory is occupied by Soviet troops, and all Polish people have been deprived of their civil rights. Therefore, the establishment of the Polish provisional government is an illegal act. At the same time, the declaration refuted the Soviet conspiracy to distort justice, unlawfully arrested key figures of the Polish secret movement, and arbitrarily conducted trials.

### U.S. Material Losses in the European War

Central News Agency dispatch - According to Washington broadcast, the U.S. Army Department announced on the 25th that in the battles against Germany and Italy, the U.S. Army lost 537,656 tons of materials at sea.

Losses of ships and personnel have been officially announced. The above losses only account for the losses of US and foreign ships transporting materials overseas to Europe, the Mediterranean, the Middle East, the North Atlantic, the South Atlantic, and Latin America. Losses of army materials in the Pacific theater are not included. In addition, damage in the domestic war zone is also not included because the investigation has not been completed. It is said that the loss of materials was mostly caused by attacks by the German and Italian armies, seventy-four ships encountered torpedoes, eight were bombed, and the cause of four ships is unknown. According to the announcement of Major General Grace, ninety-one ships dedicated to cargo ships were lost, and other damages were oil ships seven, troop transport ships two, passenger transport ships four, and other one.

### City Construction Bureau Improves Road Infrastructure, Actively Engages in Pavement Repair Work

The roads within the city limits have been neglected for years, leading to increasingly severe damage, causing considerable inconvenience to vehicles. After its establishment, the City Construction Bureau immediately paid attention to this issue and strived to improve road administration. However, due to limited funding, it could only make the most of the bureau's existing long-term workers and stock materials to actively engage in pavement repair, with filling potholes as the primary task.

Active Progress in Repair Work

This work is dispersed across various locations, with a small number of workers at each site, easily overlooked. Among them, projects that have already started and are currently still under repair include Nanjing Road, Beijing Road, Datong Road, Jing'an Temple Road, Taishan Road, Jiangning Road, Changning Road, Julu Road, Chunhua Road, Xiehe Road, West Sports Association Road, Jiangwan Road, and Weixin Road. Projects scheduled to begin repair soon include Jinling Road, Daxing Road, Luoyang Road, Wusong Road, Changzhi Road, and East Changzhi Road. Simultaneously, due to practical needs, the bureau has also assisted the Municipal Government's Suburban Highway Committee in constructing roads in the city's suburbs, such as Damin Road, Tengpei Road, Gongrong Road, Jiaotong Road, Hongqiao Road, and Tian Road, totaling over 30 kilometers. Currently, the bureau faces several significant difficulties: The workers' wages are meager, making it difficult to make a living, which inevitably reduces work efficiency. Most of the tools are old, dilapidated, and beyond repair, with no funds for replacement. The required kerosene is not easily obtainable. There is a severe shortage of transportation. The bureau is currently devising solutions to these problems, and once resolved, further progress in road administration can be expected.

Plan to Formulate a Shanghai West Flood Control Plan

The issue of drainage ditches is more complex. Fundamentally resolving the problem of street flooding is beyond the current financial capacity of the municipal government. It is reported that the Construction Bureau has drafted a flood control plan and budget for western Shanghai, addressing both immediate and long-term needs, and has submitted it to the municipal government for review. Currently, the excavation of individual air-raid shelters along the roadsides is the responsibility of each Lianbao office. The Construction Bureau has long been aware of the deficiencies in these air-raid shelters and has notified the relevant authorities to take steps to improve them.

Shanghai-Suzhou Highway Construction Project

The Shanghai-Suzhou highway construction project is being carried out through bidding by the Highway Construction Engineering Office. Construction has already begun, divided into three sections, with section engineering offices established in Zhenru, Nanxiang, and Huangdu. Each office employs approximately ten people, with experienced engineers stationed in each section to supervise the progress of the work. The current progress of the project is considered satisfactory.

Repairing Bridges for Immediate Construction

The Shanxi Road Bridge and Fujian Road Bridge have been temporarily repaired to allow pedestrian traffic. Plans and budgets for reinforcing them to allow vehicular traffic are being prepared and will soon be submitted to the government for review. The repair plans for Henan Road Bridge and Sichuan Road Bridge have been approved by the government. They are currently seeking steel plates, and construction will begin as soon as they are acquired.

Recently, there have been suggestions to use criminals, beggars, and unemployed vagrants for municipal construction work. It is reported that the Construction Bureau has also considered this, recognizing that the intention is good. However, most of the roads in the city have asphalt surfaces, and workers must possess considerable skills. Other construction projects, such as houses or bridges, require skilled technicians. To employ the aforementioned individuals in these tasks would require a lengthy period of training, and a motley crowd, often composed of the elderly, the weak, and the disabled, would require careful management. Any negligence in this regard would not only waste time and effort but also consume materials, inevitably leading to losses outweighing gains.

### Finance Bureau Explains the Calculation Method for Property Tax

The Municipal Finance Bureau is collecting the summer property tax according to the adjusted method of collecting property tax. Many households are unclear about the calculation method, and there are errors in the calculated value, and have requested explanation. According to responsible personnel from the Finance Bureau, the adjustment of property tax this time is calculated based on the property tax amount collected according to the valuation of rent in the 26th year of the Republic, and is increased to 250 times the original amount, and is still collected at the original tax rate of 14% in the 26th year. It is not calculated based on the actual amount of property tax at that time, because the valuation rent is objective and quite fair, and so on. I hope that all households will pay attention to it and avoid misunderstandings.

Bamboo and Wood Industry Tax Collection by Brokers

In order to rectify the tax administration and save public funds, the Municipal Finance Bureau has abolished the special tax collection office for the bamboo and wood industry. Regarding the above-mentioned special tax, the brokers are responsible for collecting the bamboo, wood, firewood and charcoal business tax. It is also heard that the brokers will collect the bamboo, wood and charcoal business tax from July 1st of this year.

### Gold Certificates can be Used as Cash for Collateral and as a Deposit Reserve

The Central Reserve Bank's gold certificates have been issued in four phases, and the sales volume has been excellent, and it has been highly regarded by the financial circles and merchants. After the first and second phases of gold certificates expired, many holders went to redeem gold, but with the belief that gold certificates are gold, many holders were willing to store the gold certificates and did not want to redeem gold immediately. It is now heard that the Central Reserve Bank is for the convenience of general financial institutions holding gold certificates to regulate their capital operations. For the sake of convenience, gold certificates can be used as cash for collateral, and financial institutions can also use them as a deposit reserve.

Central Reserve Bank Allows

The allocation slips used by banks and money shops in this city for the Central Reserve Bank and the Silver Union Association to prepare for collection have been scheduled to be discontinued on July 30th. The major member banks and money shops in the silver and money industries are actively discussing the cash head amount required daily at that time, and are requesting the Central Reserve Bank. According to sources in the financial community: The financial authorities stopped the exercise of allocation slips in order to prevent credit expansion, and changed to using parallel horizontal line checks. In addition to absolutely cautious development, the cash prepared cannot but be planned in advance. After the silver and money industries have verbally requested the Central Reserve Bank, they will also choose one of the calm days of the 19th of this month, and the various banks and money shops will carefully list the "current account deposit number table" of the day according to the table, which is divided into: Current deposit, Current account deposit, Special current deposit, etc., deposit and payment amount. In addition, a separate table of employee expenses and meals is attached, which is compiled separately by the Silver and Money Industry Association and submitted to the Central Reserve Bank to request an increase in the daily amount of certificate (cash) collection. The approximate amount of the money industry is about 40,000 yuan per day, and the banking industry is about 100,000 yuan or more per day, which has been allowed. The only thing to consider is the increase or decrease in the amount. It is expected that the request will be successfully resolved before the end of this month.

### Economic Bureau Bans Illegal Sales of Coal Briquettes

After the cessation of coal briquette rationing to households in this city, the citizens' needs have relied entirely on the black market, and prices have risen with various major daily necessities, and the quality of all of them is generally below the standard. Recently, it was reported that the Da Zhonghua Coal Briquette Factory at No. 1329 Lujiabang Road in Nanshi announced the distribution and sale of special coal briquettes to the city. We went to consult the economic authorities, and we were told that due to the lack of raw materials, there is no fixed date for the next round of household coal briquette rationing. As for the Da Zhonghua Coal Briquette Factory's unauthorized use of announcements to promote its products and purchase them with residence permits, it is indeed inappropriate.

Moreover, Da Zhonghua is a businessman and speaks lightly about rationing, which is extremely rebellious. The bureau has already strictly banned it.

### Sugar Industry Joint Venture to be Established at the Beginning of Next Month

The Shanghai Sugar Industry Joint Venture, which is being prepared by the Shanghai District Sugar Industry Association, has now exceeded the original quota after handling member registration applications. It is learned that the association is scheduled to be formally established at the beginning of next month. The main tasks of the association's operations are: The handling of sugar rationed to households in the city. The procurement and distribution of sugar. Other matters related to sugar and management.

Xu Jimu's "Collection of Economic Essays", remuneration of 300,000 yuan.

### Resolutions of County Meetings Should be Submitted for Approval on a Case-by-Case Basis

The municipal government believes that the various counties and districts in the city hold various meetings, often only sending meeting minutes, which are submitted in general terms. It is difficult to verify the content of each resolution, the steps, and whether there are any other obstacles in implementation. In order to conduct serious supervision, at the administrative meeting of the counties and districts convened by the County Administration Office this time, the competent department proposed that the resolutions of various meetings of the counties and districts should be submitted for approval on a case-by-case basis. The resolution was passed and has been submitted to the government by the County Administration Office for the subordinate departments to follow.

### Dinghai Shenjiamen Line Ship Service

Since the China Shipping Company resumed shipping on various lines this month, it has not only facilitated travel, but also greatly improved the smooth transportation of materials from various places, with even greater results. It is learned that the company, in view of the fact that the eastern Zhejiang coast, such as Dinghai and Shenjiamen, is a marine product area. Therefore, the company has designated it as a route range, and has now started scheduled services. There is one round trip per week, which not only transports materialism, but also carries passengers.

### Jiaotong Bank Reviews Agricultural Loans

Since the Jiaotong Bank was ordered to hold rural loans to regulate the rural economy and enhance production, although the total amount of loan funds has been limited, it has failed to expand the scope of agricultural loans, but the original funds that have been loaned to agricultural areas have achieved the effect of promoting increased agricultural production. Up to now, the number of agricultural economic loan enterprises and production increase loans in Shanghai, Jiaxing, Suzhou, Wuxi, Dongtai and other regions is quite large. It is heard that the bank has increased the number of enterprises and production increase loan customers handled by the agricultural offices. At that time, the investigations, supervision and release were all carried out by personnel sent to various regions. It is feared that there may be negligence. The agricultural loan offices should personally handle the review, and the enterprise loans should be thoroughly checked household by household, and the production increase loans should be checked in batches and household by household. At the same time, for overdue loans, personnel should be sent to urge collection as soon as possible, and it should not be allowed to be overdue.

### Brief News

The initiation ceremony of the review will be held today. Since the 24th of this month, Qingliang Temple on Niuzhuang Road in this city has invited the old master Chi Song to lecture on the Prajna Heart Sutra. It is scheduled to be completed today, and a secret initiation ceremony will be held at 6:30 pm. Those who wish to participate in the initiation can register at the temple.

The Jinshan Township Association and others will hold a public sacrifice, presided over by Chen Tao.

### Overview of the Recent Work of the Municipal Evacuation Committee

Since its establishment, the Municipal Population Evacuation Committee has spared no effort in organizing evacuation agencies, preparing transportation, and investigating evacuation destinations. It is now focusing on the mandatory evacuation of charitable organizations. The following is the situation of some of the work of the committee stationed in the Shenbao News Agency:

Various Institutions Established One After Another

Since the Investigation and Design Group and the Liaison Group of the committee began working at the Shenbao News Agency in early March, it has been three months. Due to the needs of the affairs, the Aviation and Land Committees were established one after another to specialize in renting transportation. Wang Shuxian was appointed as the director of the Aviation Committee. Jing Zhai was appointed as the director of the Land Committee. Later, because Director Wang Shuxian had other duties and could not take care of the Aviation Committee, Director Huang also took charge of its affairs. A question office was also set up to answer any questions that citizens may have about the evacuation organization. Later, as the contacts from all parties had already made some progress, and the evacuation work was about to be implemented, a bus station was established at No. 723 Xianyang Road, and a temporary wharf and office were established at the Central Market on Xizang Road and North Suzhou Road. At the same time, the evacuation destination must also be determined. After the results of the inspection and investigation by the personnel, it was unanimously recognized that Dongting Xishan in Suzhou had not suffered any losses after the war and could be an ideal evacuation destination. In order to make the liaison with the Jiangsu Provincial Government smooth, the committee's Suzhou office was established, and the Dongting Xishan branch office was established.

Summary of Work on the Aviation Route

In terms of evacuating the population by air route, with the enthusiastic assistance of the Allied Navy authorities, they agreed to facilitate the special ships evacuating the population along the route. Subsequently, the borrowing of ships was carried out. With the cooperation of our Kirk Association, the association currently has pig transport ships from northern Jiangsu and sailing ships coming to Shanghai. Usually, there are about 20 or 30 ships every day, and they do not carry goods on the return journey, which can be used for population evacuation. After inspection by the association, it was considered inappropriate to transport people in pig ships, so the association continued to negotiate with the Inland River Shipping Company, and planned to attach civilian ships to each scheduled ship on the association's existing routes. The company expressed great support for the evacuation work. Each scheduled ship was attached with a civilian ship, and each passenger paid 3,330 yuan (including ship rental, tugboat, fuel, labor, and various miscellaneous expenses along the way). The evacuation is currently being carried out one after another. Any citizens who want to evacuate to Suzhou can go to the branch offices of the executive group of the association (previously reported, such as the Baojia Office on the sixth floor of the building) to register.

Summary of Work on Land Route

After the establishment of the Land Committee, a bus terminal was first established so that vehicles could be concentrated as soon as they were available. With the assistance of the Municipal Construction Bureau, the bus station was approved to borrow a portion of the square at No. 723 Xianyang Road for parking. On the one hand, it was planned to borrow the red buses of the French Public Bus Company that were not in use as evacuation transportation, but the plan was suspended because the vehicles had other uses. Subsequently, the municipal government was requested to order the Construction Bureau to requisition vehicles from the Municipal Automobile Transportation Industry Association. In consideration of the difficulties of the merchants, it was still planned to compensate the merchants for the consumption of vehicles within the possible range so as not to cause damage. The requisition of vehicles is now being negotiated with the Construction Bureau. The rental of long-distance trucks is also being arranged. On June 5, a meeting was held with the various truck companies, and it was learned that except for a small number of cars that were not suitable for evacuation, the number that could be rented by the association was not large. According to the investigation, the total number of vehicles traveling to Wuxi, Changshu, and Songjiang is only 40 or 50. After negotiation, the car dealers agreed to transfer five trucks each week to assist, and all expenses and consumption would be borne by the car dealers. The evacuation was decided to be carried out according to this method, and a light test was conducted on the Suzhou, Changshu, Kunshan, Qingpu, and Songjiang lines. Depending on the actual possibilities, the route will be gradually expanded. We are now waiting for the citizens to register with the executive group for evacuation, and we will drive as soon as they are gathered. In addition, for the evacuation of the people from various places in North China back to their hometowns, we have negotiated with the Huazhong Railway Company to attach special evacuation cars to facilitate evacuation, which will be realized soon.

### Saving Laundry Fees to Help Charity School Funds

A letter from Mr. Yu Sanhua said: "I am writing this letter to inform you that I have often felt the pain of dropping out of school in my early years. Therefore, I have saved the laundry fees and raised 5,000 yuan, which I have sent to help the 'Charity School Fund'. The amount is not enough to help those who have dropped out of school, but it is just a small effort. I hope that the honest merchants on the sea will generously contribute to charity and help education, which is my deepest wish."
