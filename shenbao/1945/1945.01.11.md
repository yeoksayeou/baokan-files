### Prelude to the Battle of Luzon Island Unveiled at Lingayen Gulf: Japanese Forces Bravely Intercept Enemy Landing Troops

Tokyo, 10th (Central News Agency dispatch) - The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced at 3:30 PM on the 8th: (1) Enemy forces invaded Lingayen Gulf on the morning of January 6th, shelling the coast of the gulf. By approximately 9:40 AM on the 9th, they began landing near San Fabian and Lingayen. (2) Local Japanese land forces engaged in fierce fighting, while Japanese air units also launched intense attacks on enemy ships.

Philippine Front Line Base, 10th (Central News Agency dispatch) - American forces finally began landing in Lingayen Gulf on the 9th. Enemy ships patrolling in front of San Fabian and Dagupan provided fierce artillery cover. The enemy fleet off Damortis and Santo Tomas dispersed in front of San Fabian at 9:00 AM, advancing directly towards the coast. At this time, a barrage of anti-aircraft fire erupted above the enemy escort fleet. Instantly, enemy ships suddenly emitted thick black smoke. By the time the smoke cleared, the warships had disappeared, undoubtedly sunk by the brave suicide attacks of Japanese special attack units. At 9:40 AM, enemy landing troops finally advanced towards both San Fabian and Lingayen. Under Japanese artillery fire, their leading boats were shattered one after another. However, the first wave of enemy landing troops continued to advance under heavy artillery cover, finally reaching the coast. In an instant, American soldiers scattered from the boats and landed, desperately rushing forward. But under the artillery fire of the Japanese positions, American soldiers fell one after another on the beach. Following the first landing force, the second wave also began to land, with fifteen or sixteen large boats of 4,000 tons each breaking through to the shore. Around noon, the sound of artillery fire rumbled, shaking the coast. The prelude to the decisive battle of Luzon Island was finally unveiled on the coast of Lingayen Gulf.

### Over Thirty Enemy Ships Sunk in Waters West of Manila Bay: Japanese Army, Navy, and Air Force Special Attack Units Deploy Together

Philippine Base, 10th (China News Agency dispatch) - The decisive battle in the Philippines has entered its formal stage. The enemy's intention to land on Luzon Island has been exposed. The enemy fleet, consisting of approximately one hundred landing craft and transport convoys escorted by aircraft carriers, battleships, cruisers, and other vessels, invaded Lingayen Gulf since the 6th. Simultaneously, another large enemy fleet of over two hundred ships from the Sulu Sea was rapidly heading north. The Japanese naval special attack units and army and navy air forces, who had been seriously monitoring and waiting to intercept this enemy action, launched a fierce surprise attack. Currently, ships and air units from both sides are mixed together in the waters west of Luzon Island, engaging in a major battle. Japanese naval special attack units charged head-on into the enemy fleet moving north in the waters west of Manila Bay at dawn on the 8th, taking advantage of the enemy convoy's confusion to launch a devastating attack. It has been determined that over thirty enemy transport ships of various sizes have been sunk so far. When Japanese aircraft discovered enemy forces appearing in the Sulu Sea area, they immediately launched a fierce attack. The enemy fleet, heavily damaged, was completely thrown into chaos. The damage inflicted on the enemy by the Japanese special attack units this time was the greatest. As of the 9th, there were only about seventy enemy transport ships of various sizes in Lingayen Gulf, and the new convoy heading north from the Sulu Sea, with Manila as its center, had not yet bombed the southwestern area of Luzon Island. However, Manila and other parts of Luzon are still very calm because the Japanese army has strong defensive positions in the Philippines.

Philippine Front Line Base, 1st (Central News Agency dispatch) - Since the 6th, the enemy fleet attempting to forcibly land on Luzon Island and invading Lingayen Gulf has suffered enormous losses after being fiercely attacked by Japanese army and navy special attack units. However, they are still seeking opportunities to land, patrolling near the Gulf's waters and continuing to bombard San Fernando with gunboats. Furthermore, the subsequent enemy transport convoys, also heading from the Sulu Sea to the western waters of Leyte Island, reappeared in the waters west of Luzon Island and disappeared on the morning of the 8th after being fiercely attacked by Japanese army and navy surface special attack units. It has been determined that over thirty enemy transport ships of various sizes have been sunk so far. In addition, the continuous attacks by Japanese surface ships have inflicted heavy damage. Currently, Japanese army and navy special attack air units and surface ships are still launching fierce attacks, and an intense air and sea battle is underway in the waters west of Luzon Island.

Japanese Army Base on the Philippine Front, 10th (Central News Agency dispatch) - The enemy forces attempting to land on the west coast of Luzon, fearing the inevitable suicide attacks of the Japanese special attack units and having lost aircraft carriers due to repeated attacks, are only using makeshift aircraft carriers to launch naval gun bombardments in the waters of Lingayen Gulf. Afterwards, they changed formation and fled out to sea, their movements extremely slow. At dawn on the 8th, the Japanese Air Force, led by army special attack units, fiercely attacked over sixty enemy ships escaping from Lingayen Gulf. One plane struck an enemy ship, and another struck an enemy battleship, causing them to sink immediately.

### Enemy Aircraft Attacking Japan's Mainland: Eleven Shot Down, Eighteen Damaged

Tokyo, 10th (Central News Agency dispatch) - The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced at 2:00 PM on the 10th: When enemy aircraft attacked the Japanese mainland on the afternoon of the 9th, the results of the Japanese interception were as follows: Eleven enemy aircraft were shot down, including four that were crashed into, and eighteen enemy aircraft were damaged. Japanese losses were five aircraft.

Tokyo, 10th (Central News Agency dispatch) - Sixty enemy B-29 aircraft from Mariana Island bases dispersed to attack the Kanto, Tokaido, and Kinki regions. A post-attack investigation of the interception results showed that eleven aircraft were shot down and eighteen were damaged, a total of twenty-nine, which is half of the attacking enemy aircraft. When enemy aircraft attacked on that day, Japanese air defense units immediately deployed to intercept them, launching a courageous counter-attack, pursuing enemy aircraft everywhere, and launching intense attacks, preventing the enemy aircraft from maneuvering, scattering their formations, and causing them to drop bombs blindly into the sea or mountains and flee in panic. The Japanese interception battle was extremely fierce, so important factory facilities were undamaged. Four of the enemy aircraft shot down were crashed into by Japanese air defense units in a heroic suicide attack. One of the planes involved in the crash returned to base after shooting down the enemy aircraft. Another parachuted into the sea, and its fate is unknown. Two others died heroically after the crash. A more detailed look at the results of this battle shows that about twenty enemy aircraft invaded the Kanto region, half of which were shot down, and the remaining aircraft were damaged, so most of the invading enemy aircraft were unable to return to Mariana Island bases. In this battle, Japanese losses (including aircraft involved in crashes) totaled five aircraft.

Enemy Aircraft Raiding Taiwan: Twenty-Three Crashed

Tokyo, 9th (Central News Agency dispatch) - According to a report from Taipei, the Taiwan region announced that 450 enemy aircraft and a small number of large aircraft flying from mainland China attacked various parts of Taiwan from 6:40 AM to 4:30 PM on the 9th. Our damage was minor, and the results of the battle, as determined so far, include fifteen enemy aircraft shot down (four of which are unconfirmed) and eight destroyed.

Tokyo, 9th (Central News Agency dispatch) - At 1:30 PM on the 9th, about sixty enemy B-29 aircraft flying from the Mariana Islands attacked the Japanese mainland. Approximately twenty attacked Tokyo and surrounding areas, and about forty attacked the Hokkaido area, invading in a dispersed manner. They were bravely intercepted by Japanese special attack units and air defense units, dropping bombs blindly, some even dropping bombs into the sea, making a complete spectacle of themselves. After an hour and a half, they fled south over the sea. Although some bombs were dropped near factories, there were no hits. Japanese ground forces suffered no losses. The enemy aircraft's dispersed bombing was intended to disperse Japanese interception forces, but they were ultimately repelled by the Japanese air defense units.

### Prime Minister Phibunsongkhram Concurrently Serves as Minister of Commerce

Bangkok, 10th (Central News Agency dispatch) - After the resignation of Minister of Commerce Sanit Nilapanit, Deputy Minister Wan Waithayakon temporarily took over the post. Now, Prime Minister Phibunsongkhram has been appointed to concurrently hold the position. Consequently, Prime Minister Phibunsongkhram has resigned from his concurrent position as Minister of Finance, which has been filled by Deputy Minister Siri Siriyong.

### Japanese Wing Political Association Holds a Meeting of Parliamentary Staff

Tokyo, 10th (Central News Agency dispatch) - The Japanese Wing Political Association held a meeting of parliamentary staff at its headquarters at 3:00 PM on the 9th. All staff members, including Chairman Kanemitsu, attended the meeting to discuss various matters regarding the opening of the 86th Diet session. They discussed Prime Minister Koiso's policy address and decided to appoint the following three individuals: Tsuneo Kanemitsu as Permanent Director-General for general administration and diplomacy; Yujiro Nakajima as Director-General for military supplies, labor, and transportation; and Masayoshi Kimura, Vice Chairman of the Political Research Committee, as Director-General for food and people's livelihood. These three individuals will represent the Wing Political Association and express opinions based on the policies determined by the association's various bodies to encourage the government.

### American Planes Attacking Wuhan: Chongqing Pilots Used as Guides

A Certain Front Line Base, 9th (Central News Agency dispatch) - The Chongqing American air fleets that attacked the Wuhan area on the afternoon of the 8th were fiercely intercepted by Japanese fighter planes. Four were shot down and twelve were destroyed. Ground fire accounted for the destruction of two, for a total of twenty aircraft destroyed. Two of the pilots of the four Chongqing American planes shot down after sustaining damage were confirmed to be Chinese pilots belonging to the Chongqing American Joint Air Force. The Americans, fearing Japanese interception, use Chinese pilots as pioneers, while the American aircraft acted as overseers, circling in the rear to ensure their own escape. This tactic of the Americans has been seen many times on land battlefields. The Americans are now even using this tactic in air combat, sacrificing other races, which is detested by both gods and men.

### Extending the New Movement and Completing the War: Director-General Lin Encourages the People Through Broadcasting

Continue to devote your strength and share in happiness.

We have been participating for two years. What responsibility have we fulfilled for the war effort in these two years? We ask ourselves what is different before and after participation? What procedures do we need to increase production to? We need to save on expenses. Do our clothing, food, housing, and transportation conform to the wartime system? Only by devoting one's strength can one share in happiness. We want freedom, liberation, justice, and peace. We must pay a corresponding price. Our price is to practice the New National Movement.

To demand liberation, one must pay the price.

We have been participating for two years. What responsibility have we fulfilled for the war effort in these two years? We ask ourselves what is different before and after participation? We need to increase production, to what degree? We need to economize on consumption. Do our clothing, food, housing, and transportation conform to the wartime system? Only by devoting one's labor can one share in happiness. We want freedom and liberation. We must pay a substantial price. Our price is to practice the New National Movement.

It has been a full three years since the Leader personally drafted the outline of the New National Movement in January of the 31st year of the Republic [1942]. In these three years, we have followed the Leader's instructions and carried out the work of the New National Movement. Although a little bit of work has accumulated to form a rough foundation, it is still very far from the Leader's expectations, and the world's war situation and the Greater East Asia war situation are becoming more serious day by day. Compatriots, the peace movement is the stage for the re-departure of the National Revolution, and the Greater East Asia War has reached the decisive period. Whether we advance or retreat, whether we win or lose, depends on whether the people of the country are moving along the path of the New National Movement.

Shoulder the responsibility of revitalizing China.

If we want to revitalize China and defend East Asia, we must first have the vast majority of the people rise up to shoulder this responsibility, and to shoulder this responsibility, we must first cultivate the ability to shoulder it. Contributing little, enjoying much, planning for oneself, not being willing to exert effort for the country and nation, and lacking a sense of unity, like a heap of loose sand – these are all the bad criticisms that others give us as citizens. We do not shy away from saying that this is our inferior nature as citizens. We want to be new citizens, we no longer want to be old citizens. We want to make a total reckoning of all the thoughts and actions of the old citizens. The New National Movement is to replace the individualism of the past with nationalism, to replace the false European and American democracy with a democratic centralism system, and to replace communism with the People's Livelihood Principle [Minsheng]. Under one principle, one core ideology, loving China and loving East Asia, the 450 million people of China must possess this belief, practice this belief, and become new citizens, then China's future will have hope, and East Asia's future will have hope.

Promote the New Movement and redouble our efforts.

Before the Incident [the Marco Polo Bridge Incident in 1937], some people advocated the New Life Movement. The New Life Movement was intended to cultivate many good individuals. All the people of China would become good people. However, it only planned from the standpoint of the individual to make them good people, which is not enough and is impossible. We must have a strong national and national concept. We must have a correct East Asian awareness of freedom. What we want to create is an outstanding citizen of the Republic of China, an outstanding East Asian nation. In East Asia, which is dominated by international imperialists, and in China, which is invaded by international imperialists, to want to keep oneself clean and to protect oneself is not only delusional but also absurd. If China does not obtain freedom and equality, all living innovation is nonsense. If East Asia is not liberated, then China's freedom and equality cannot be obtained, and even if it is obtained by chance, it cannot be guaranteed. The fundamental meaning of participation in the war lies in this, and the fundamental spirit of the peace movement also lies in this. Since the New National Movement was advocated, we have adhered to the Leader's intention to promote the New Movement. The achievements and progress of the New Movement's work in these three years have been very slow. Although various difficulties in the environment have hindered the promotion of the New Movement's work, we have kept in mind the Leader's instructions. We must speak honestly and be responsible. We are absolutely unwilling to shirk responsibility. Precisely because there have been many unsatisfactory aspects of the New Movement's work in the past, we must work harder in the future.

Recognize friends and enemies and choose the path.

I remember last October when I represented Chinese youth in Japan to visit the Leader, the Leader summoned me before his sickbed and earnestly urged us to expand the New Movement, organize and train the youth, and entrust this to our comrades. These words became the Leader's last words to our young comrades, and every word is deeply etched in our hearts. We can only promote it with the greatest determination, no matter how difficult it is, swearing by the Leader's last words. What we can tell the Leader's spirit in heaven is only to realize the Leader's last words, save China, and save East Asia. And to save China and save East Asia, we cannot rely on a small number of comrades, but on the majority of the people, and the majority of the people must become the new citizens of the country and the new patriots of East Asia.

We want to tell the compatriots in Chongqing and in mainland China that you are also compatriots of the Republic of China, and you also love the Republic of China that we love. Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, although some people think that as long as Britain and the United States counterattack, Japan can be defeated, and as long as planes are sent to bomb the peaceful areas, the people's hearts can be disturbed, perhaps this is inevitable. However, the war facts of the past three years, the hideous faces of Britain and the United States towards Chongqing, and the arrogance of the Communist Party towards Chongqing, who is a friend and who is an enemy, each person knows the water's temperature. Compatriots, compatriots across the country, with internal worries like this, and external troubles like this, strategies like this, and facts like this, where should we go in the end? We must stand firm, open our eyes, and decide the path we should take. Compatriots, China is our China, and East Asia is our East Asia. Only by following the Leader's last words and practicing the New National Movement can we revive our China and defend our East Asia. Set a firm determination, a unified step, expand the New Movement, and complete the war.

Editorial

### New Situation in the Philippine War

The Philippine War has had a very intense development these past few days. The enemy Americans, with Leyte Island and Mindoro Island as their centers, are invading in different directions, from Mindanao in the south, through the seas of Negros Island (i.e. Negros Island) and Panay Island, all the way to Luzon Island in the north. The scale of operations is very large, seemingly willing to make great sacrifices and bet everything on one throw.

Judging by the operational areas and nature of the fighting, the current Philippine War can be divided into five parts:

First is the land battle on Leyte Island and Mindoro Island.

Second is the transport war on the seas off Mindanao Island.

Third is the liaison war between Panay Island and Negros Island.

Fourth is the landing war on Luzon Island.

Fifth is the diversionary war outside the Philippine area, in the Taiwan Strait and the Sumatra Sea.

Of these five parts of the war, the fourth part, the landing war on Luzon Island, is the main focus of the enemy American operations. The most important goal of the enemy Americans is to attempt to land on Luzon Island and to want to have the decisive battle with the Japanese army on Luzon Island. Allied Prime Minister Koiso also pointed out at the cabinet meeting on January 4th that "The decisive battle of Leyte has shifted to the decisive battle of Luzon."

On Leyte Island and Mindoro Island, the enemy Americans are now actively engaged in consolidating their landing bases in order to form a strategic center, but the Japanese army's land forces on both islands are putting up a very strong resistance, constantly launching fierce surprise attacks on the landed enemy forces. At the same time, Japanese aircraft are also continuously carrying out destructive attacks on the enemy's airfields on the islands. As the enemy Americans are unable to consolidate their landing bases on both islands, the so-called strategic center role and mission are difficult to achieve.

On the Mindanao Island side, because the island is in the southernmost part of the Philippines, the enemy American reinforcements and supplies coming north from New Guinea and Australia must all pass through the seas off Mindanao and the Sulu Sea west of Mindanao, so the Japanese army is strongly engaging in a transport war against the enemy Americans there, in order to cut off the enemy's supplies. The enemy's transport convoys have been constantly subjected to heroic attacks by the Japanese forces in recent days.

Panay Island and Negros Island are located in the central part of the Philippine Islands, in the northeast of the Sulu Sea, northwest of Mindanao, and between Leyte Island and Mindoro Island, slightly to the south. In order to connect Leyte Island and Mindoro Island, the enemy Americans also have great ambitions for Panay Island and Negros Island, and the fighting on the seas off these two islands has been quite tense in recent days. Enemy ships have suffered heavy losses under the interception of the Japanese forces.

The war on the seas off Luzon is now mainly concentrated in Lingayen Gulf on the western coast of Luzon Island. The enemy is currently launching most of its forces to land near Lingayen and San Fabian (northeast end of Lingayen Gulf), in order to establish a foothold on Luzon Island. However, given the strength of the Japanese forces' resistance, the enemy's dream of landing will not be easy. Even if they do land, the sacrifices will be too great, and they will be exhausted, and in the end they will be powerless. As for the enemy's air raids on Taiwan and Okinawa, they contain the intention of showing off and disrupting the Japanese rear. Also, the appearance of the British Indian Ocean Fleet in the western seas of Sumatra also has a responsive and diversionary effect. But no matter how the enemy fights, they are encountering head-on blows from the Japanese forces everywhere. At present, the enemy, on the one hand, seems to have a fierce tone, but on the other hand, they are actually short of reserves. The longer the long-distance expedition goes on and the deeper it goes, the greater the chance of being annihilated. The strong naval and air forces of the Allied countries will surely have even greater development in the future.

### Anhui Province Governor Luo Leaves Bengbu for Beijing

Bengbu, 10th (Central News Agency dispatch) - Anhui Province Governor Luo Junqiang returned to the province last week to supervise the handover of duties. After convening a meeting, he ordered that even a single tree or blade of grass must be transferred cleanly, and ordered all commissioners and county magistrates not to leave the province without authorization during the transition period, and especially not to resign lightly. Upon the announcement that Shanghai was about to be taken over, he took the fast train to Beijing at 10:00 PM on the 9th, accompanied by his secretary and a few guards. Leading figures from the party, government, and military of the province, various organizations and schools, as well as the Allied Minister of Liaison, Japanese economic advisor Harada, Consul-General Morita, the military police, and resident community, lined up in the heavy snow and cold wind to see him off. It was heard that as the train reached Mingguang, responsible officials and the people and students of each county along the way also lined up to see him off, which was unprecedented for previous provincial governors.

In addition, a telegram stated that Anhui Province Governor Luo Junqiang, in view of the Anhui Daily and Central News Agency Bengbu branch staff's hard work throughout the year, especially awarded a bonus of 200,000 yuan at the time of the year-end performance appraisal, which was handed over to President Liu to distribute to all staff members.

### Recent Progress of the Waterway Project: Interview with Responsible Official of the Waterway Management Bureau

Nanjing, 10th (Central News Agency dispatch) - Last year, the Executive Yuan's Waterway Management Bureau submitted to the Executive Yuan for the record and approval the four design changes for changing the project implementation plan, listing the reasons. The Executive Yuan considered this to be not only a matter of the project itself, but also related to the income and expenditure of funds, and specially transferred it to the Ministry of Construction for review and reply. However, the Ministry of Construction stated that the detailed drawings of the existing status and planned completion of the project according to the four design changes were all lacking, so the review work could not begin, and the Ministry of Construction reported the situation to the Executive Yuan. Upon learning the details, the Executive Yuan issued a clear order in December of last year to the Waterway Management Bureau to supplement the detailed drawings for review. It is learned that the Waterway Management Bureau has forwarded this order to the construction site to begin surveying and supplementing the detailed drawings. In order to understand the current situation of the Waterway project, the reporter specially visited the responsible official of the Waterway Management Bureau, who said: After the Waterway project signed the contract, the original completion date was the end of December from the start date, but due to difficulties in material transportation and local security, the number of workers gradually decreased, which hindered the progress of the project. Although the Waterway Management Bureau anticipated that in order to enable the project to reach a satisfactory stage, it was decided to change the four design points in order to complete it as scheduled. To date, it is estimated that 60% of the project can be completed. The contractor, Aonan Company, has requested the Waterway Management Bureau to extend the deadline to before February 15th. Now, due to rain and snow, the roads are blocked, so the details of the construction site and whether it can be completed by the deadline cannot be predicted. Today's regulations stipulate that if the contractor cannot complete the project as scheduled, they should be fined to compensate for the losses. The Waterway project has repeatedly made excuses to extend the deadline, and this issue will be resolved properly when the project is completed.

### China and East Asian Nations Strive for Self-Preservation; Chairman Chen, Acting Head of State, Announces to the World Participation in the War

Nanjing, 10th (Central News Agency dispatch) - Chen, the Acting Chairman of the National Government of China, issued a declaration to the world at 5 PM on the 9th, the second anniversary of China's participation in the war, urging British and American imperialists and the warlords of the Chongqing regime. The main points are as follows:

Since the outbreak of this great war, it has lasted for several years. The reason why the people of the world have suffered such unbearable pain and unprecedented disasters is none other than the insatiable ambitions of British and American imperialism. Britain usually trumpets freedom and equality, but in reality, it employs narrow-minded colonial exploitation. Their so-called colonial policy is a concrete manifestation of financial monopoly and the invasion of foreign peoples. However, this old order is on the verge of collapse due to this great war. It is hoped that the British people will quickly sweep away their Anglo-Saxon sense of superiority and their contempt for foreign races, abandon their economic monopoly policy, and recognize the lofty principle of mutual benefit and equality among nations. Then, the final victory will belong to the nations that demand self-preservation, self-defense, and co-prosperity. The same goes for the United States. The leaders of the American war are all instigated by Jewish capitalists, driving the American people onto the path of war. While the American mainland has not suffered the slightest threat, they have ignited ambitions to dominate the world, attempting to eradicate the survival of tens of millions of oppressed people who demand freedom and liberation. Their arrogance is truly infuriating.

Sharing Hardships, Sharing the Same Goal

Regarding our comrades in Chongqing, for the past twenty years, we have been jointly inheriting the last will of the Founding Father, working towards the same goal of completing the great revolutionary cause, and sharing hardships together. Today, it is merely a difference of opinion in the process. Fortunately, under my leadership as chairman, China has continued to strive for freedom and equality, reaching a point where the foundation for restoring sovereignty has been laid. Therefore, in order to safeguard sovereignty, domestic unification is essential as soon as possible. The unequal treaties have now been abolished, and concessions have also been recovered. This fact gradually proves the ardent assistance of our ally Japan to China. China and the nations of Greater East Asia are currently striving for the self-preservation of their nations and the co-prosperity of mankind, continuing to fight alongside Japan and Manchukuo. Our future shines brightly, and the aggressive ambitions of Britain and the United States will inevitably fail. In this turmoil, only by adhering to the principles of international justice and mutual benefit and equality can we achieve a future of co-prosperity. Under this new order, all nations can attain lasting peace.

### Director Izubuchi Reveals Enemy America's Ambitions; Utilizing the Chongqing Faction to Wage War Against Japan

Yesterday (10th) at 3 PM, Director Izubuchi of the Army Press Department of our ally Japan in Shanghai, held a regular press conference on the Bund at the Hua Mao Hotel, on the eighth floor, and immediately revealed the tragedy of Chongqing suffering difficulties due to being utilized by enemy America. His statement is as follows:

Chongqing's Military Strength Suffers Heavy Losses

Since the Japanese army's offensive operations on the mainland last year, the Chongqing faction has suffered extremely heavy losses. All of its land producing agricultural and mineral products has been completely damaged. The total or partial loss of its military strength amounts to more than sixty divisions. Those suffering considerable losses also number over two hundred and thirty-eighty thousand. The loss of armaments is equivalent to thirty to forty divisions, and the loss of bullets is equivalent to forty to fifty divisions.

Enemy America's Assistance to Chongqing Has Ulterior Motives

After suffering this major blow, the Chongqing faction has increasingly strengthened its reliance on the United States, reorganized its troops, strengthened conscription, and mobilized students. The military and political sides have joined forces in an attempt to reverse the decline and restore independent resistance. However, the purpose of American aid to Chiang is to utilize Chongqing's manpower and resources to wage war against Japan. At the end of last year, the US Supreme Command sent liaison officers to various units within the Chongqing faction, attempting to place the Chongqing troops under American command and attempting to land in southeastern China. However, the Chongqing faction hopes to borrow American assistance and fight on its own, which runs counter to American ambitions. This kind of contradictory situation is nothing short of a major tragedy for the Chongqing faction. Its pitiful state is imaginable.

Japanese Army's Operations Achieve Successive Victories

Since the Japanese army bravely fought in southwestern Guizhou and northern Vietnam, it has achieved successive victories, creating a posture of attacking Chongqing. It is expected that considerable results will be achieved within this year. In the future, the United States plans to use the Chinese mainland as a decisive battlefield and utilize Chongqing's manpower and resources to fight. However, Chongqing's military strength will definitely not withstand a single blow from the Japanese army, and its ultimate annihilation by the Japanese army is beyond doubt.

### North China Holds Commemoration of War Participation

Beijing, 10th (Central News Agency dispatch) - Various institutions and organizations, such as the North China Political Affairs Commission and the New People's Society, held commemoration events on the 9th, the second anniversary of the National Government's participation in the war, to unite the determination of the 100 million people of North China and strive for the victory of the Greater East Asia War. A mass rally was held at the New New Theater on the 10th, with more than 2,000 people participating. Following that, a war-strengthening symposium and a youth total mobilization consultation meeting will be held on the 15th. The above events are all hosted by the Central General Assembly of the New People's Society. At the same time, the Beijing General Assembly of the New People's Society is also hosting a student debate. Meanwhile, the Pacification General Headquarters of the North China Political Affairs Commission held a military parade of the Pacification Army at 10 AM in the square in front of the Taihe Gate. Chairman Wang and Superintendent Du of the Pacification General Headquarters both personally attended. In the afternoon, a memorial service was held for the fallen soldiers of the Pacification Army. Following that, the Pacification Army paraded through the city in formation. In addition, there were various commemorative lectures and broadcasts, etc.

### Legitimate Commerce Protected by Legal Rights

Nanjing, 10th (Central News Agency dispatch) - Since the central authorities regarded increasing production as one of the essential requirements for adapting to the wartime economic system last year, the relevant authorities have actively encouraged agriculture, industry, and commerce, striving to revitalize them and supporting their entry into the right track, in order to increase production and ensure that both military needs and people's livelihoods can be met. In order to understand what kind of countermeasures the authorities will take this year for various commercial companies and other organizations to continue to complete the work of increasing production, this reporter specifically interviewed the person in charge of the relevant department. According to the conversation, most commercial companies were extremely satisfied because some enterprise companies were not well-organized, mostly taking the name of speculation and hoarding in order to seek illegal profits, which caused prices to rise and people's livelihoods to be affected. Later, after several adjustments by the authorities, those with unsound organizations gradually eliminated. Thus, legitimate businesses are protected by the legal rights of the authorities and can develop normally. Therefore, this year, based on past situations, we will still follow the previous policies. All legitimate businesses will not only be registered, but also given strong legal protection, in order to achieve the established policy of increasing production, so that military needs can be met and people's livelihoods can be stabilized.

### Change of Minister of Transportation in Chongqing

Lisbon, 10th (Central News Agency dispatch) - According to a telegram from Chongqing, the Chongqing faction had previously established a wartime transportation bureau, appointing former Minister of Transportation Yu Feipeng as its first director, but now it has changed again, and Yu Feipeng has been transferred to the position of Minister of Transportation.

### Revision of Provisional Regulations for the Management of the Aquatic Products Industry

(Central News Agency, Shanghai) - The provisional regulations for the management of the aquatic products industry have been revised and promulgated by the Ministry of Industry and instructed the Aquatic Products Administration to implement them accordingly. Liu Weijun, the director of the administration, expressed his opinions on the administration's aquatic products administration, as follows:

"The revised provisional regulations for the management of the aquatic products industry have been issued to the administration. The administration is currently preparing to implement them in accordance with the various regulations. The current work plans to first conduct registration of the aquatic products industry. The aquatic products industries that should be registered include steamers and engine boats, fishing, fixed-net fishing, various net fishing, angling, aquaculture, miscellaneous fishing, and seaweed and shellfish harvesting. The ice industries that should be registered include the transportation and sale of aquatic products, aquatic products cooperatives, fish markets, fish brokers, aquatic product manufacturing and storage, refrigeration, and fishing gear manufacturing. Generally, merchants often regard registration as a daunting task. I also pay close attention to this point. I would also like to solemnly declare that, in handling the matter, I will uphold the spirit of Minister Chen's integrity and dedication to public service and earnestly handle the matter. If any personnel are found to be disobeying orders, they will be severely punished and will not be tolerated. I also hope that all relevant parties will report them at any time and cooperate to ensure that corruption is eliminated."

### Directors of Various District Income Tax Bureaus Hold Office Affairs Conference

Chairman's Speech

The general idea is that since the opening of this tax, under the guidance of the Ministry of Finance and the efforts of the various district bureaus, there has been progress over the years. However, due to the central government's huge expenditure during the war, the approved estimate of income tax for the first half of this year is quite large. The responsibility this year is greater than in previous years. I hope that the directors attending the meeting will carefully explore and gather the wisdom of the group to carry out the work. The collection achievements in the first half of the year should be assessed and adjusted so as to increase tax revenue. Subsequently, the Secretary-General of the General Assembly reported

Proposals of the General Assembly

A total of thirty-five items, including twenty-four tax-related proposals and eleven proposals on expenses and other matters, were decided to be divided into two groups: (1) Tax Affairs Department, (2) Expenses and other New York Group, for separate review. The review meeting will be held at 2 PM. Luo Guangxu was elected as the convener of the Tax Affairs Group, and Huang Yin was elected as the convener of the Expenses and other Groups. Only a small part of the proposals were reviewed by 5 PM, so the proposal review will continue at 10 AM this morning (11th), and the review proposals will be collected and sorted out in the afternoon, and the meeting will continue tomorrow (12th) to discuss and review the proposals.

### Current State of Education in Jiangsu Province

— Yifei

While this reporter was in Jiangsu, I had the opportunity to attend the "Third Wartime Education Conference of Jiangsu Province." At the invitation of Director Yuan Shu of the Education Department, I was fortunate to be present, though in a humble position, and to hear the insightful views of various officials from Jiangsu Province and allied nations. I was particularly pleased. Having also served in the education sector myself for many years, I was extremely interested in this conference. The conference concluded last year (December 26th), and I am writing this article to share what I observed and my own humble opinions, to provide reference for those concerned with education.

Looking Back

"Education" bears the mission of cultivating talent for a century, and has a profound impact on the rise and fall of the nation and the fate of the people. Before 1937, education in Jiangsu Province was well-developed, and it deserved the reputation as a "province of culture." After the war, there were significant changes. Although dedicated educators have made efforts and the provincial education authorities have worked hard to promote it, there has been some recovery. However, qualitatively, it is still lacking.

Prevalence of Private Schools

An increase in the number of schools in a province should be a symbol of educational development, but a closer analysis reveals otherwise. Currently, private schools are abnormally developed in Jiangsu Province. These schools have rudimentary equipment that does not meet standards, and most of them are "commercialized" in nature. They only know how to attract students to enrich their own pockets and do not care about anything else, let alone contribute to education. Such "academic shops" are everywhere. Among them, there are some with relatively substantial scale and some achievements, but these are few in number.

According to the "Overview of Elementary Education in Jiangsu Province" recently compiled by the Jiangsu Provincial Education Department, there are currently a total of 2,225 elementary schools in the province, of which 5 are provincial, 1,767 are county-run, and 453 are private. County-run schools are the most numerous, followed by private schools, and provincial schools are the fewest. The opposite is true for secondary education. Currently, the province has 11 provincial secondary schools, 2 normal schools, 4 vocational schools, 1 Japanese language school, and 19 county-run secondary schools. There are as many as 58 private secondary schools in the province. The disparity in numbers is clear at a glance. The main reason for the proliferation of private schools has already been mentioned. As for provincial and county-run schools, their number has remained stagnant and has even decreased recently. The reason for this is nothing more than the province's financial difficulties, and the fact that successive administrations have often regarded "education" as a less important part of their administrative scope. It is no wonder that the progress of "educational" facilities lags behind other areas.

Overview of Funding

Last year, education funding in Jiangsu Province accounted for only a little over 6.27% of the province's total expenditure. Although the increase in this figure over the past five years cannot be said to be slow, it is incomparable to the skyrocketing rise in the cost of living. According to the Jiangsu Provincial Education Expenditure for 1940, the total amount of provincial and county funds was 3,700,489 yuan. In 1941, it increased by 2,442,381 yuan. In 1942, it was 3,890,089 yuan. In 1943, it was 48,048,458 yuan. In 1944, it was 255,622,341 yuan. The total expenditure for 1944 was 303,670,799 yuan. Looking at the above-mentioned increases over the years, the amount for 1944 is almost a hundred times greater than the amount for 1940. However, compared to the soaring prices, the difference is more than a thousand miles.

Since education funding and the rising cost of living are like the tortoise and the hare in a race, it has a major impact on the livelihood of teachers and staff. Currently, the highest salary for a provincial elementary school teacher is 3,350 yuan (based on a base salary of 190 yuan), and the lowest is 1,450 yuan (based on a base salary of 120 yuan). For provincial secondary school teachers, the highest is 5,180 yuan (based on teaching 26 hours of courses), and the lowest is 2,300 yuan (based on teaching 12 hours). Private schools each have their own policies, so we will not discuss them for now. If we look at the "Statistics on Income and Loss per Yuan of Expenditure for Educational Personnel" compiled by the Jiangsu Education Department in mid-November 1944, according to this most realistic and scientific statistical table, we can see that for the highest-paid secondary school teachers, their income is only 0.36 yuan for every yuan of living expenses, with a loss of 0.64 yuan. For the lowest-paid teachers, their income is only 0.19 yuan for every yuan of living expenses, with a loss of 0.81 yuan. For elementary school teachers, the income of the highest-paid teachers, according to the above situation, is only 0.23 yuan, with a loss of 0.77 yuan. The income of the lowest-paid teachers is 0.19 yuan, with a loss of 0.81 yuan. According to the Education Department's recent budget, the highest-paid secondary school teachers could receive 5,860 yuan per month from August to October 1944, and 6,560 yuan per month from November 1st. However, according to the minimum cost of living in October, their expenses were 12,000 yuan. After October, due to the sharp rise in prices, it has increased to 18,000 yuan. The huge difference between income and expenditure is as such. From this, we can imagine the difficult living conditions of general teachers and staff.

Lack of Qualified Teachers

In the past, due to the threat to their livelihoods, many teachers and staff changed to other professions. Those who remained were often unqualified and incompetent, which had a significant impact on the studies of children and young people. It is said that previously, when government offices screened teachers, they implemented examinations. As a result, 90% of the candidates either had incomplete certificates or insufficient experience. If strictly enforced, there would be a severe shortage of qualified candidates, so they had to compromise, resulting in the current mixed and messy lineup. However, many of these people lack interest in education and only have a "better than nothing" attitude, perfunctorily fulfilling their responsibilities. Some even take on courses at several schools to increase their income. Because they are unable to be in multiple places at once, they have to implement a rotation system of skipping classes. It is reported that in a certain secondary school in Suzhou, from September to November, there were more than 360 class cancellations. The disorganization is evident.

Since most teachers are passively accepting their fate and indifferent to students' studies, constantly preoccupied with solving their livelihood problems, they have no time to improve their own knowledge. Therefore, students' performance will inevitably be poor. It is reported that previously, the Jiangsu Provincial Education Authority held a writing competition for secondary school students. After grading the papers, it was found that some papers had not been corrected by the teachers. This provides a glimpse of the situation.

Teachers' Lives

The education sector in Jiangsu has reached a critical point. Fortunately, at this critical moment, the authorities have established the "Teachers' Livelihood Subsidy Committee" and the "Teachers' Livelihood Insurance Committee," which are like life-saving medicines for the critically ill education sector in Jiangsu. We sincerely hope that the competent authorities will take greater determination to implement fundamental solutions for the long-term. Here are a few points based on my own humble opinions:

(1) The suffering of teachers' lives is beyond the imagination of most people. If we want to improve education, we must first start by stabilizing the lives of teachers. The best way to address the root cause is to implement a system of in-kind distribution of salaries for teachers and staff. If we can plan comprehensively and obtain the cooperation of relevant agencies, this measure can be easily implemented.

(2) In addition, we should also implement "revenue generation" measures for education funding. Jiangsu's education sector has 110,000 mu of academic land. We should use decisive measures to investigate this land and prevent local bullies from continuing to control it. If so, the 220 million yuan in academic land revenue would be like life-saving nectar for the people in the Jiangsu education sector who have been suffering for so long.

(3) According to the wartime education plan, we should implement production education. Although there are already a few schools (such as the Jiangsu Education Institute, where students' food and vegetables are self-sufficient, and the Suzhou Provincial Vocational School, which implements paper making) that have already implemented it and have achieved results, we should vigorously promote it universally or force its implementation so that we can contribute to wartime production. In this way, both education and production can reduce the burden on students' parents.

(4) In terms of teachers, we should also quickly eliminate those who are unqualified or disloyal. After raising salaries and stabilizing their lives, we should try our best to recruit outstanding individuals. At the same time, we should establish "Teachers' Mutual Reading Clubs" so that they can engage in academic discussions and research in addition to teaching. This is crucial to the future of education.

(5) If we want to achieve twice the result with half the effort, we must break down the barriers between the competent authorities, local officials, and schools. We must ensure that the situation at the bottom is communicated to the top and that everyone works together to reverse this critical situation. Otherwise, even with wise and competent officials like Director Yuan, they will not be able to help.

The above are my humble opinions. I have selected the most important ones and presented them to the Jiangsu authorities for reference. (Sent from Suzhou)

### Five Organizations Gave Farewell Yesterday to Officials Transferred to Municipal Government, Secretary-General Wu Expressed Three Hopes

The Municipal Advisory Committee, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the Citizens' Welfare Association, the Shanghai Branch of the China News Association, and the Shanghai Sushan Association jointly held a tea party yesterday (10th) afternoon at the Kangle Restaurant to bid farewell and express gratitude to Municipal Secretary-General Wu, Director Sun of the Relocation Office, Director Yuan of the Finance Bureau, Director Xu of the Economic Bureau, Director Ye of the Public Utilities Bureau, and Director Feng of the Goods Allocation Office, who have served the city diligently and have recently been transferred to other positions. In addition to the aforementioned guests of honor, over a hundred guests from various circles and municipal officials, including Director Dai, Director Fan, Director Zhang, Councilor Pan, Councilor Cheng, Councilor Zhang, Councilor Ling, Yan Fuying, Ding Fubao, Shen Siliang, Xiang Kangyuan, Zhou Bangjun, Luo Nezhai, and Pei Yunqing, attended, and were personally received by Li Sihao, Wen Lanting, Yuan Lvdeng, Lin Kanghou, and Chen Lin. The event began with a speech by Chairman Li Sihao, who briefly stated that the five organizations, including the Municipal Advisory Committee, were expressing their gratitude and bidding farewell to Secretary-General Wu and the directors of various bureaus for their efforts in governing the city for the benefit of the citizens, and hoped that the officials would continue to assist with various issues in Shanghai in the future.

Secretary-General Wu Delivered a Speech on Behalf

Secretary-General Wu then delivered a speech on behalf of the attendees, briefly stating, "I express my gratitude for the sincere cooperation of the Advisory Committee and the business community in the past. The newly appointed Secretary-General has very good political standing, experience, and ability. I hope that you will assist the new official in the same way that you assisted us in the past, and then all the problems in Shanghai will be solved smoothly. Finally, I express three hopes: First, although the municipal health and hygiene issues are not as important as the people's livelihood and price issues, Shanghai has always paid great attention to municipal health and hygiene in the past because it was an international city. I hope that we can maintain the original strengths in the future. Second, financial independence and the establishment of a budget system. There was a good scale in the concession era in the past, and I hope it will be maintained. This system is not an Anglo-American system, but a system commonly used in the world. Third, there are many problems that need to be solved in Shanghai today. It is necessary for the Chinese and Japanese authorities and civil leaders to cooperate to gradually solve them." Yuan Lvdeng gave a speech at the end, and the meeting adjourned at around 4:00 p.m.

### Winter Relief Committee Inspects Congee Distribution Centers

The Shanghai Special Municipal Government's 1944 Winter Relief Committee has established nine congee distribution centers, providing congee to 9,000 people daily. The distribution began on December 25th of the previous year and has been ongoing for half a month. In order to understand the status of the relief efforts and conduct on-site inspections of the conditions at each center, the committee's Deputy Director Chen Riping, Relief Group Director Jin Wuwen, and General Affairs Group Director Sun Guangdi (representing Shen Wenyuan) set off from the Municipal Government at 9:00 a.m. yesterday (10th) and visited the congee distribution centers in Nanshi, Xujiahui, Zhabei, and Hongkou for on-site inspections. The results indicated that the following three points still need improvement: (1) The congee distribution time could be shortened to avoid the problem of people receiving congee from two places at the same time. (2) The amount of rice and firewood used varies slightly and should be further standardized. (3) Firewood is the main fuel, and the current price of firewood is expensive, making it one of the main expenses for congee distribution. Ways to improve economic efficiency and save money should be explored. The number of people receiving congee at each center is as follows: Center 1: 1,546 people, Center 2: 978 people, Center 3: 800 people, Center 4: 1,000 people, Center 5: 1,000 people, Center 6: 500 people, Center 7: 1,000 people, Center 8 (not visited), Center 9: 500 people. Except for Center 1, which has a surplus and plans to reserve it for the poor in the winter shelter, the other centers have a surplus. Poor people in the vicinity can register at the original Salvation Army site at 630 Maohai Road, Hongkou, to receive congee. If people from all walks of life have any opinions or criticisms about the Winter Relief Committee's facilities, they can send a letter directly to the committee, or they can send it through this newspaper.

Yesterday, the Datong Enterprise Bank's Board of Directors organized a special fundraising team, which raised 300,000 yuan. The bank moved to a new location and opened on the 5th of this month. Congratulatory guests filled the doors, numbering over three thousand people. On that day, the bank received deposits of 150 million yuan from customers and 470 million yuan from fellow banks. This clearly demonstrates the bank's reputation for business integrity. Furthermore, Mr. Ta Pengnian, the General Manager of the bank, has extensive social connections and a significant position in the financial world, leading to rapid business growth. Recognizing the importance of education and aiming to practice frugality, the bank converted all congratulatory gifts into cash, totaling 1,500,170 yuan. Of this amount, 300,000 yuan each was donated to the *Shen Bao* Education Fund and the *Xinwen Bao* Student Loan Fund. The remainder was donated to the Chinese Children's Welfare Association. The former initiative will educate several outstanding talents for the country, while the latter will nurture several useful children for the country. Both are acts of charity with positive significance. The bank's enthusiasm in promoting and responding to the concept of donating congratulatory gifts to support education is particularly commendable. In addition to expressing our gratitude to the bank, we hope that the city's industrial and commercial sectors will also economize on extravagant celebrations in the future and donate to meaningful charitable causes. This will benefit the nation and society, so why not do it?

Shanghai City Sounds

### Suppression of Usury

— Ai Peng

The current skyrocketing prices in Shanghai, which seem to have no end, are certainly due to the shortage of supplies, the stagnation of production, transportation difficulties, currency inflation, and the manipulation by cartels. However, it is also important to recognize that there is another dark side to Shanghai's economy, and that is the rampant usury that has emerged recently. With usury, the cost of goods increases, and the ultimate burden is still passed on to the consumer. If we want prices not to rise, how can we allow this? Therefore, when we talk about suppressing prices today, there are many ways to do so, but suppressing usury is an urgent task that cannot be delayed!

A year ago, the publicly agreed monthly interest rate for Shanghai's money houses was only around 3%, and at that time, commentators already considered their interest rates high. Who knew that since last year, short-term loans have been increasing monthly, reaching 8% by the end of the year (which is equivalent to 80 yuan of interest per month for every 1,000 yuan). In reality, such high interest rates are not available unless the borrower has a deep relationship with the directors of the money house. Politely, 2% or 3% is added to the publicly agreed interest rate as a handling fee; some even settle at 12% or 13%. The so-called black market for interest rates has become an open secret. In addition, there are some people who secretly operate bill-discounting businesses. The term is as short as five or seven days, and the interest must be deducted in advance. The interest rate is as high as 170 to over 200 yuan per month for every 1,000 yuan. The interest they charge is far greater than the "loan sharking" practiced by Indians in the past. This causes general cargo owners and business operators, especially the so-called "independent brokers," to bear such heavy interest, which implicitly increases costs. Merchants seek profit from capital, so they will not sell at a loss. Naturally, prices rise step by step! Everyone blames the heavy layers of checkpoints along the way to Shanghai for extortion, which increases costs. But who knows that cargo owners feel the same pain about the burden of interest on loans as they do about the heavy levies along the way!

Because the bill-discounting business is good and the interest is high, in the last six months, a bill-discounting business has been added to the 360 lines of business. These friends can collect tens of millions of yuan in interest each month by simply gathering several hundred thousand yuan in capital and a ledger. Three days to one deduction, five days to one turnover, they are doing everything they can to exploit. Such unscrupulous activities that harm the social economy by making money without working should not be allowed under a wartime economic system.

Originally, usury and high prices are both products of the same economic environment. Therefore, to suppress prices, it is also necessary to suppress usury. What is most fortunate is that the new mayor who presides over Shanghai's administration is also the highest authority in charge of the nation's finances. Therefore, having the new mayor eliminate this dark side of Shanghai's economy will surely be twice as effective with half the effort. We hope that: (1) Beyond the publicly disclosed interest rates of Shanghai's money houses, no handling fees or other names should be added, and the bad habits of the black market should not be followed. Perhaps people in the financial world will use the excuse of increased expenses that cannot be made up to justify raising interest rates. It should be known that these words can only fool outsiders. In fact, last year, almost every money house in Shanghai with more deposits had considerable surpluses! (2) The abuse of the term "discounting" should be suppressed. Currently, the so-called discounting of many money houses is simply nonsensical. It cannot help but make friends who have been actively promoting acceptance drafts and bill discounting feel discouraged over the years. Their so-called discounting is the same as the bill-discounting that caused a major disaster decades ago, which was a strict prohibition for the industry. They only care about heavy profits, drinking poison to quench their thirst. Once they encounter an accident, it will inevitably affect the entire economic machinery. It is hoped that the new mayor can restrain the money industry and engage in self-discipline, and no longer engage in nominal discounting business. Tickets that do not involve commercial transactions — especially bad checks — absolutely have no room for discounting. (3) Illegal usury between private individuals must be strictly prohibited. According to the law, heavy exploitation has always been prohibited. The civil law has a maximum limit for interest rates, and exceeding this limit is illegal and has no effect. Moreover, during wartime, it should not be allowed to increase the burden on debtors and endanger the social economy with heavy interest. Private operations of discounting are also not allowed under the wartime financial management regulations and must be included in the list of strict prohibitions.

We believe that if usury can be reduced — at least so that it does not run rampant again — it will make a considerable contribution to the work of suppressing prices and stabilizing people's livelihoods. If we sit idly by as usury runs rampant and do not suppress it, it will inevitably cause high prices and usury to be both the cause and the effect, and mutually promote each other, which is definitely not the good fortune of the people of Shanghai!

### "Blood Stains the Sky" Preview Screening Yesterday - Lieutenant Salt Field Attends and Speaks

The "Blood Stains the Sky" preview screening, co-organized by China Film Company and China Daily, was held at the Huguang Grand Theater yesterday morning. No less than several thousand people from all walks of life attended. Lieutenant Salt Field of the Allied Fleet News Department attended and gave a speech, elaborating in detail on the current Pacific war situation. He briefly stated: The enemy American forces have suffered unexpected blows in the battle for the Philippines. Recently, they landed in Lingayen Bay on Luzon Island, but they have been on the verge of collapse due to the strong counterattack of the Japanese army. Because the enemy American supply line is getting longer and longer, it is becoming more and more difficult to fight. On the other hand, the Japanese army has a very short supply line, which makes it more convenient for them to fight, so they can be sure of victory. Finally, he also encouraged everyone to rise up together and jointly destroy the ambition of the British and Americans to dominate East Asia and make it a secondary colony.

### Rationalization of Rice Rationing

Due to the needs of war, material shortages and the implementation of a rationing system are inevitable phenomena in any country participating in the war. Therefore, the citizens of this period must not only strive to produce, but also live frugally, eat less, and work harder to achieve final victory. However, this situation has a certain limit. In principle, no matter how small the rationed items are, they must be sufficient to meet the minimum needs of life. And the most important thing is fairness. Rich and poor are treated equally, and there are no special classes in the country. It is said, "Do not worry about scarcity, but worry about inequality." Inequality is indeed most likely to arouse resentment among the people and breed great crises!

But regrettably, the situation in China is exactly like this. Although rationing is implemented, it is not comprehensive. The quantity of rationed items is insufficient, and the rationing period is inaccurate. The people's minimum living needs rely on the black market outside the control system. As for distribution, the distributors are also generally providing fair distribution, but because of the special circumstances of Chinese society, the recipients feel that it is unequal. Because the wealthy live lavishly and comfortably, they do not need rations at all. Even if they are rationed, they discard them like worn-out shoes. But the poor and needy need them very much, and they look forward to them with bated breath, fearing that they will not be enough. With such a situation, it is naturally unreasonable to adopt universal rationing.

At present, all kinds of rationed items have the above-mentioned shortcomings, and rice is particularly prominent. Because rice is the main food of the people, whether the rationing is sufficient or not can directly affect prices and people's livelihoods. In the past, although the rice rationing agencies have changed several times, they have mostly followed the rules and regulations without reforming the rice rationing system. The most obvious shortcomings of the old system are: 1. Insufficient quantity. 2. Inaccurate rationing period. 3. Non-uniform rice quality. 4. Unreasonable distribution. The first two items directly threaten the people's livelihood and cause prices to skyrocket, the black market to run rampant, and affect the citizens' trust in the rice rationing agencies. The third item, non-uniform rice quality, gives rice merchants an opportunity to cheat, and makes citizens suffer invisibly. As for the last item, whether the distribution is reasonable or not is especially important. Regarding this point, there is a more detailed discussion in the December 5th *Shen Bao* editorial column "Priority-Based Rice Rationing": "The current rice rationing system is most likely to make people feel that there are shortcomings that have not been fully addressed. In addition to the insufficient quantity and the inaccurate period, there is also the unreasonable distribution. Because the quantity is insufficient and the period is inaccurate, distribution is particularly important to be reasonable in order to compensate. ... In terms of distribution, an absolutely universal method cannot be adopted, and there should be reasonable distinctions and priority-based rationing. ..."

What is the most reasonable distribution? In other words: What is priority-based rationing? In principle: It is to increase the rationing quantity for those who really need it and those who should maintain their needs so that they have enough to meet their living needs. Others will have their rationing stopped altogether. We hope that the competent authorities can thoroughly adjust the rationing system and implement priority-based rationing to compensate for the shortcomings of insufficient quantity and inaccurate rationing period in the past, so that the people's food can be on the right track and eliminate the black market to relieve the people's plight.

As for the implementation plan for priority-based rice rationing, what standards should be followed for distribution in order to be reasonable? It is difficult to plan accurately. Regarding this point, the author's idea is as follows:

As for whether this method is the most standard and reasonable, I hope that wise people will not hesitate to give advice, conduct joint research, and improve it.

### Rationalized Rice Rationing Method

(1) The rice rationing objects can be divided into four classes: A, B, C, and D. The rationing quantity and period are determined accordingly.

A. All households engaged in war production and serving more than two people are classified as Class A.

B. All personnel engaged in civilian production and specially serving the country and society, or only one person serving in a military factory, are classified as Class B.

C. Wage earners and laborers connected to society should be classified as Class C.

D. Widows, elderly, orphans, and refugees who cannot earn a living are classified as Class D.

All other wealthy classes and unemployed vagrants will have their rationing stopped.

(2) The rationing quantity is the largest for Class A, and decreases in order. However, the quantity should not be less than the minimum living needs of Class C in principle. As for Class D, it may be rationed less. Charitable organizations can solicit donations from wealthy people in society and directly purchase and transport them from rice-producing areas to supplement them.

(3) The rationing period is directly proportional to the quantity. Class A has the longest period, and shortens accordingly. For example, Class A is rationed once a month, Class B and C are rationed once every 20 days, and Class D is rationed once every 10 or 15 days.

(4) Once the rationing quantity and its limit are announced, they should not be changed easily to maintain credibility. As for prices, they should not be adjusted frequently to stimulate other prices. The competent authorities may set a standard price, stipulating that it will not be increased within a certain period. For example, if 8,000 yuan per dan is set as an example, the price will not be increased between January and March of the 34th year of the Republic of China; after April, it can be gradually increased according to the cost; and then adjusted again after June. The people will understand the difficulties of the competent authorities and naturally accept it. Do not increase the price arbitrarily.

(5) The rationing method is currently based on households. After implementing priority-based rationing, it can be based on group rationing: Class A is based on military factories as a unit. Class B is based on civilian factories, schools, and governments as a unit. Class C is based on commercial associations as a unit. Class D is based on charitable organizations as a unit.

The competent authorities can stipulate a time. If each unit group needs to be rationed rice, they can apply within the period, reporting the number of people and the total amount of rice. Overdue applications will not be approved. Later, rice tickets can be distributed to each unit and then redistributed. This allows the distributor and the recipient to have sufficient contact. If there are any increases, changes, or movements, they should also be reported by each unit to be checked against the household registration of the Baojia.

(6) The quality of the rationed rice should be clearly stipulated in the future, and ambiguous words should be avoided. It is best to ration one kind of rice so that rice merchants cannot cheat.

(Appendix: The reason why Class A is only allowed for those who serve in military factories with more than two people is nothing more than a kind of reward. In fact, Class B and C are the most common rationing objects)

The above six methods are all rough outlines. Other problems await the review of the competent authorities. If they can be implemented one by one, it will not only stabilize people's livelihoods, increase production, but also correct the social extravagance, eliminate the black market, prevent hoarding, and force unemployed vagrants to return to their hometowns and leave Shanghai because of rice restrictions, thereby achieving the purpose of dispersing the population. There are many benefits in one move, depending on whether the competent authorities can sincerely reform.

### New Star Pharmaceutical Factory Launches Medicine Assistance Campaign, Selecting Ten Types of Medicines Worth Three Million Yuan, Specially Contracting Sixteen Hospitals to Handle Separately

A letter from New Star Chemical Pharmaceutical Factory states: "Respected Sir/Madam: Recently, prices have risen limitlessly, which is like a whip lashing life extra urgently. Under the current complex social and economic conditions, seeking a stable life is already difficult, let alone adding illness. Even the rich suffer when they get sick, and medicine is so scarce, with the raw materials for making medicine becoming less and less each day. It is common for the rich to be unable to buy medicine even with money, let alone those who are poor and sick, so poor that they cannot even afford to buy medicine? Especially for the salaried class, they cannot afford to get sick at this time. For a family of eight, or even a smaller family of five, if one person gets sick, the whole family is in trouble. Even if they can receive free diagnosis and treatment in public hospitals, where will they find the money to buy medicine? If they spend all their limited income on this, wouldn't the whole family have to go hungry? So, besides 'toughing it out,' they are simply helpless. However, the salaried class is most likely to get sick. Their bodies are generally not very healthy, and with insufficient nutrition, their resistance is reduced. Once their resistance is weakened, disease takes the opportunity to invade. Misfortunes never come singly. Besides resigning themselves to fate, what else can they say? This situation is now very common. There are more and more poor people, and the salaried class is almost destitute, with no way to appeal. How tragic this is! New Star, as a member of the pharmaceutical industry and a member of society, feels heartbroken at the sight of this and cannot shirk its responsibility. We plan to do our utmost to provide relief, selecting the following ten types of New Star medicines, valued at a total of three million yuan, all of which are essential medicines in today's medical treatment. Following New Star's factory motto of 'Making medicine without forgetting medical ethics, using old medicine without forgetting its quality,' we donate these to society to show our sincerity in serving:

1.  New Sinthiazol Ampules
2.  New Sinthiazol Tablets
3.  New Sinthiazol Powder
4.  Benzylamid Ampules
5.  Pasulfamide Tablets
6.  Calglute Ampules
7.  Isalax Tablets
8.  Pautonin Tablets
9.  New Star Ointment N.S.
10. Jensenco Pills

The target beneficiaries are: (1) The salaried class serving in the industrial and commercial sectors; (2) Scientific and technical personnel in academic institutions; (3) Teachers in schools at all levels; (4) Students receiving loans from the *Zhong Xin* (中新) two newspapers' loan programs; (5) The direct family members of the above four categories; (6) All of the above are limited to those with poor families and diligent work.

At that time, we will invite Dr. Fu Qing, Dr. Zhou Cheng Hu, Dr. Yu San, Dr. Yu Xin En, and Dr. Gu Yu Qi to preside over the matter, and consult with the following major hospitals to share the work:

1.  Red Cross Society First Hospital 2. Red Cross Society Third Hospital 3. Guangci Hospital 4. Hongren Hospital 5. Tongren Second Hospital 6. Shanghai Hospital 7. Shanghai Local Hospital 8. Shanghai Children's Hospital 9. Siming Hospital 10. Jimin Hospital 11. Shanghai Factory United Hospital, Nanshi Relief Hospital 13. New Pharmaceutical Industry Association First Hospital 14. New Pharmaceutical Industry Association Second Hospital 15. Shanghai Hygiene Experimental Zone 16. Xinzha Hygiene Experimental Zone

We know very well that the relief work needed in today's society is countless, and there are many urgent problems that have not been solved—we ourselves have many problems that need society to help us solve. This three-million-yuan medicine assistance campaign is truly a drop in the bucket and cannot solve the fundamental problem. What we hope is that everyone will come forward to find solutions where there seems to be no solution, and do their utmost with compassion. If small units like ours can collectively come together to form a large unit, then we will have more power and may be able to fulfill our wishes. We hope that our humble efforts will be appreciated.

(Note) The "Medicine Assistance Campaign" initiated by New Star Pharmaceutical Factory is indeed very much needed at this time. People who are generally poor and sick often suffer on their sickbeds due to their inability to afford medicine. The target beneficiaries specified above are all honest and upright in terms of their status, but their family circumstances are very difficult. If they unfortunately suffer from illness, wasting time and losing their jobs, it is not just a loss for themselves and their families. The launch of this campaign by New Star Pharmaceutical Factory can be said to be a righteous act that benefits society and the nation. We sincerely hope that major pharmaceutical factories in Shanghai can also follow suit and expand the organization, forming a unified institution, so that their contributions will be even greater. (Those who meet the above qualifications and need medicine assistance, please contact the above-mentioned hospitals for treatment).

### Charity Auction of a Hall Painting

A Mr. Li, to commemorate his deceased father, donated a large *zhongtang* (中堂) painting of "A Hundred Birds Paying Homage to the Phoenix" to this office. The original letter is as follows: "Respected Sir/Madam, my late father was fond of giving and served as the chairman of various charitable organizations in his hometown for many years, engaging in relief work. Although I have the intention to inherit his legacy, I lack the ability and feel deeply ashamed. Seeing the increasing number of poor people suffering from cold and hunger in Shanghai today, and the growing number of young people dropping out of school, I cannot bear to stand idly by. Therefore, I donate a large *zhongtang* painting of "A Hundred Birds Paying Homage to the Phoenix" inherited from my ancestors, painted by Yang Can (a person from the Jiaqing era). I pray that you will evaluate it and sell it at auction, with all proceeds going to your various charitable causes. I believe that there are many wealthy and generous people in Shanghai who will be willing to donate generously to benefit the poor. Then this painting can belong to a virtuous gentleman, and I can fulfill my wish to commemorate my late father's legacy. How fortunate that would be!" (Note: This painting is on display at this office, and you are welcome to visit and bid.)

### Commemorating Deceased Virtue

Cao Runsheng, Yongcang, and Youfei brothers wrote: "Respected Sir/Madam, on the third of this month, we held a memorial mass for our late father, Mr. Cao Xin'an. We are grateful to our relatives and friends for their generous gifts. We now, under our mother's instructions, send three hundred thousand yuan of the gift money to your newspaper. One hundred thousand yuan will be donated to the Xujiahui Sacred Heart Nursery for the benefit of our relatives and friends. We hope that you will publish this letter in the newspaper, and we will be deeply grateful."

### Fuyou Orphanage Holds Fundraising Campaign

The Shanghai Fuyou Orphanage cares for over three hundred orphans, with monthly expenses of nearly two million yuan. Due to financial difficulties, a fourth fundraising meeting was held at the YMCA on Ningxia Road on the sixth of this month, with a goal of one and a half million yuan. Over a hundred directors and guests attended the orphanage, making it an unprecedented event that broke all previous fundraising records for the orphanage. Wen Lanting and Lin Kanghou, two prominent figures in society, served as honorary captain and captain, respectively. Mr. Wen said in his speech, "At this time, prices are rising and life is becoming more difficult, so there are more and more orphans. If we do not provide timely relief, the future of society will be greatly affected. Therefore, we hope everyone will work hard, as this is our duty." Mr. Lin then said, "The Fuyou Orphanage is at the forefront of relief work in Shanghai. I often visit the orphanage and eat with the children, and I find these innocent children to be very lovable. We are getting older, and the future of the country depends entirely on the children. Therefore, we must cultivate the children, and we must provide relief to children who have lost their support. We all have children, and we must take care of helpless children equally, as this is our inescapable responsibility." He also said, "Mr. Wen and I will each donate one hundred thousand yuan to do our part. There are many people here who are ten or a hundred times more capable than we are, so we hope they will donate generously." The directors and guests present were moved by the speeches of the two elders. Guan Chao and Jiang Ziyun each pledged one million yuan on the spot. Zheng Jianyuan and Yu Guanming each pledged five hundred thousand yuan, Xia Shikui pledged three hundred thousand yuan, and Wu Ruqing, He Zhaosong, Xia Caigui, Cheng Xiangzhi, and Shen Yongkang each pledged two hundred thousand yuan. The中华一元學會, Xu Lianfang, Ge Leisheng, Yu Zhitian, Zhuang Bingchun, Zhan Fuxi, Wang Nianzu, Li Jianxian, Wang Kun, Zhang Gengshen, Shi Huiren, Jia Yanqi, Ning Sihong, Zhu Kuangming, Li Zixia, Cai Runsen, Pu Wenbin, Zhou Yuesheng, Xu Jing, Hu Xiangyao, Yang Jingcheng, and Wang Huaiquan each pledged one hundred thousand yuan. We hope that all sectors will respond enthusiastically so that the orphanage's relief work will not be interrupted. If you would like to donate, in addition to sending donations to the association at No. 432, Cishou Building, Nanzhi Road, this office can also collect donations on your behalf.

### Sponsoring Translation and Compilation Projects to Save Scholars from Misfortune

Times of turmoil are truly a misfortune for scholars. Even Du Fu, the Poet Sage, could not avoid the starvation of his beloved son! The economic chaos of the past month has pushed the livelihood of scholars in Shanghai to the brink of despair, which is deeply regrettable. Culture is the lifeblood of a nation, and the scholars of an era are the ones who maintain the culture of that era. I hope that enthusiastic people in society with status and wealth, will feel the pain in their hearts and sponsor various translation and compilation projects to provide work for those who make a living with pen and ink, so that they can avoid the misery of cold and hunger. Saving scholars is to prolong the lifeblood of a culture, which is more effective than passive relief. (Tang Jinggao)
