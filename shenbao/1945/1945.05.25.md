### Japanese Summons Aviation Industry Representatives to Hold Motivational Meeting; Prime Minister Suzuki Exhorts Production to Repay the Nation

Tokyo, 24th (Central News Agency) – The Japanese government summoned over a hundred representatives from aviation industry companies in Tokyo for a motivational meeting held at the Prime Minister's official residence on the afternoon of the 24th.  Government officials, including Prime Minister Suzuki and other ministers, attended, as well as industry figures such as Mr. Furukogata, Vice President of the Aviation Industry Association, and other representatives. Prime Minister Suzuki delivered a speech, followed by speeches from Military Supplies Minister Kata and Information Bureau President Shimomura regarding the "Urgent Task of Aircraft Production." Mr. Furukogata then delivered a response on behalf of the attendees, after which the meeting adjourned.  At 5:00 PM, a separate meeting was held regarding aircraft production, with Vice President of the Aviation Industry Association Kata, President of Nakajima Aviation Industry Kiyoichi, President of Aichi Aviation Aircraft Aoki, President of Kawasaki Aircraft Tanigawa, President of Kawanishi Aircraft, and others engaging in earnest discussions with the Prime Minister, the Army and Navy Ministers, the Director-General of the Air Force Arsenal, and the Director-General of the Air Force Ordnance Bureau, Hanamaki.

### Prime Minister's Address

Tokyo, 24th (Central News Agency) – Prime Minister Suzuki addressed the representatives of aviation industry companies at the motivational meeting, with the gist as follows:  Today, the situation on Okinawa Island and in the entire war zone has reached a critical point of fierce fighting for every inch of land. The intense battles have continued unabated, and we now face the most severe military situation.  Besides expressing our gratitude for the spirit of the loyal and valiant special attack forces, we also hope that the people in the rear will inherit the fighting spirit of the frontline special attack forces and dedicate themselves to production and defense. The current war situation demands not only the vigorous morale of our soldiers but also three-dimensional warfare that combines the essence of modern science, with aircraft at its core, to determine the key to victory or defeat.  We urgently need to urge the aviation industry warriors to rise up and strive to make the war situation favorable. The most fundamental requirement for increased aircraft production is the enthusiasm, that is, the fighting spirit, of the industry warriors.  However, since the recent major air raids, the attendance rate of industry warriors at factories has noticeably declined, which is truly regrettable. Recently, a certain factory in the Kansai region was bombed by enemy aircraft, resulting in a tragic loss of life.  However, the attendance rate at the factory the next day reached 100%. I was deeply moved upon receiving this report. This is an example of steadfastly guarding one's workplace.  The aviation industry in which you are engaged is the highest comprehensive industry in our country, and this industry encompasses all levels of society. The factory is a microcosm of society, and you, who bear the responsibility for production, are not only responsible for a company or a factory but also for society and are its leaders.  You should deeply understand this principle, step forward in the factories, and strive to serve the nation.

### Fierce Battles Unfold on Okinawa's East Coast; Japanese Aircraft Severely Damage Enemy Vessels

Tokyo, 24th (Central News Agency) – In the southern part of Okinawa Island, enemy forces have been gradually reinforcing their troops to the front lines since the 19th of this month, strengthening their offensive posture. The enemy's attacks are primarily aimed at the eastern coast, with no major changes in the battle situation on the western coast.  From the 19th to the 22nd, the battle situation on the eastern coast was roughly as follows: The enemy advanced from the east side of Unadama Hill on the east coast, through Yonabaru, towards Amagoi Village. Japanese forces promptly counterattacked, engaging in fierce battles. The enemy's reinforcement and resupply efforts seem to be facing considerable difficulties due to the progress of the battle situation in that area.  Also, on the high ground west of Momohara, northeast of Shuri, 300 enemy soldiers attacked. North of the 50th Stone Ridge, 200 to 400 enemy soldiers, with 5 to 10 tanks as vanguard, attempted to invade Japanese positions. Fierce battles ensued.  Furthermore, west of Shuri and in the Makabi area, enemy land forces repeatedly attacked with numerous tanks, gradually pressing towards Japanese positions. A portion of the enemy forces in the Makabi area finally reached the south. From the overall battle situation, it appears that the enemy is currently attempting to break through Japanese positions in the eastern region in order to advance towards the rear of Shuri.

Subsequently, at around 4:30 PM that afternoon, seven enemy B-25 aircraft, divided into two groups of three and four, intruded into the airspace above Shumshu Island, strafing Japanese garrison positions with machine guns. Japanese forces immediately launched an aerial counterattack, shooting down four of them and destroying two on the ground with anti-aircraft fire. At around 6:30 PM that afternoon, the enemy again approached Horomushiro Island's Kataoka Bay with approximately five small vessels and attacked Japanese positions.

### Churchill Reappointed to Form New Cabinet; Parliament to be Dissolved in Mid-June

Stockholm, 24th (Central News Agency) – A London dispatch reports that a bulletin from 10 Downing Street stated that King George VI formally accepted Prime Minister Churchill's resignation yesterday afternoon and re-authorized Churchill to form a new cabinet in the capacity of Prime Minister on the same day. A bulletin was issued from the Prime Minister's residence several hours later as follows: After Prime Minister Churchill received the King's solemn mandate to form a new cabinet, he requested the King to dissolve Parliament. The King has authorized Prime Minister Churchill to dissolve the existing Parliament on June 15th in accordance with the Imperial Edict, based on the agreement formally signed by the leaders of the various parties in the House of Commons on January 17th. Currently, under the three major opposing political leaders, approximately 2,000 candidates are eagerly hoping to enter the political stage within six weeks. However, the central figures in this general election are only Churchill, the 70-year-old leader of the Conservative Party; Attlee, the 63-year-old leader of the Labour Party and Deputy Prime Minister of the Coalition Cabinet; and Sinclair, the 54-year-old British Air Minister (of the Liberal Party faction). According to current regulations, there are 640 seats in Parliament, and the Conservative Party has more than 500 candidates, nearly half of whom are military personnel. The Labour Party also has no fewer than 500 candidates, including a large number of women, while the Sinclair Liberal Party has only about 300 candidates. The date of the general election has been set for July 5th or 11th.

### British Labour Party's Foreign Policy

Stockholm, 24th (Central News Agency) – According to information received here, the Labour Party, which may continue the Conservative Party's rule and preside over the government of the British Empire for the next five years, abruptly clarified the following four foreign policies yesterday: The British government will be the central organization of the British Empire and the British Commonwealth. Britain will never use small countries to check large countries. European issues should be resolved at the World Peace Conference. This foreign policy was drafted by Labour Minister Bevin, who once integrated with Prime Minister Churchill, at the Labour Party's annual conference held at Blackwater. The 1,100 Labour Party representatives attending the annual conference will unanimously use this policy as a talisman during the general election.

At the same time, Bevin solemnly stated in his speech: Regarding Germany, if we want to prevent Germany from redeveloping its war-making capabilities, we must make the most of the 60 million Germans. Regarding India, we must close the "India Office" and transfer the affairs it handles to the "Home Office." Regarding trade, the British Empire will certainly maintain certain preferential rights, and all countries can levy tariffs on trade with Britain.

Finally, Bevin expressed the following attitudes towards European countries: Regarding France, France has leaned towards the left, so only those on the left can understand the sentiments of the left. Regarding Italy, we Labourites must treat Italy again as we did when Mussolini was in power and Italy was strong. Regarding Poland, there may be fascists among the Poles, but none of the recently organized socialist parties have a fascist tinge.

Editorial

### The Japanese Naval Spirit (Part 2)

The decisive force in the naval battle off Tsushima forty years ago was Japan's "Naval Spirit." Today, forty years later, the decisive force in the Pacific War is still Japan's "Naval Spirit."

In this war, the Japanese Navy launched a surprise attack on the U.S. base at Pearl Harbor in Hawaii on December 8, 1941, giving a head-on blow to the enemy's conspiracy to encircle Japan, shocking the world, changing the color of the Pacific map, and ensuring the liberation of various countries and peoples in Greater East Asia. At that time, the Japanese naval power was fighting against the combined naval power of Britain and the United States, which was theoretically very difficult. However, the facts refuted the theory. Japan bravely leaped into the war and achieved unprecedented victories, which is precisely a manifestation of Japan's "Naval Spirit"!

The Japanese "Naval Spirit" was not only manifested in the victories of 1941-42 but also fully demonstrated in the strategic stalemate stage from 1942 to 1944. The first person to demonstrate the greatness of the Naval Spirit was Marshal Isoroku Yamamoto. As early as when he was serving as a second lieutenant candidate, he had inherited the glorious Naval Spirit tradition of Marshal Tōgō and expressed that "dying in the line of duty is the best death." When the disarmament preparatory conference was held in London, Lieutenant General Yamamoto published an article in the Asahi Shimbun on New Year's Day in 1935, recounting his experiences in the Russo-Japanese War. He said that at that time, precisely on May 27th, a piece of shrapnel wounded his foot and took two fingers from his left hand. In an instant, he felt that "a person, in the line of duty, makes the best effort, which is the most appropriate principle, and the enemy has no sense of unease!" For more than thirty years, his belief has not changed slightly. This Naval Spirit of his later led him to "make his best effort" in the front line of commanding operations thirty-eight years later, in April 1943, and die for the country!

Marshal Yamamoto arose and proceeded to the Pacific frontline to take office as the commander-in-chief of the Japanese fleet. Marshal Koga inherited Marshal Yamamoto's legacy without shame. Immediately after receiving his appointment, he expressed his determination: "I will accompany the many heroic spirits in heaven, including Marshal Yamamoto, to seek to surely kill the enemy and complete the great task of protecting the country." He instructed his entire army to "serve the public with duty" and "defend the deployment to the death." As Admiral Takahashi said, "Commander-in-Chief Koga has extraordinary ability and insight in guiding the overall operations in the Pacific at all times and is worthy of being the most appropriate second Yamamoto." His "heart to destroy the enemy must be forever engraved in the hearts of the entire army" finally led him to sacrifice his life for the country on the front line, following Marshal Yamamoto. This "Koga Spirit" is even comparable to the "Tōgō Spirit" and is a high expression of the Japanese "Naval Spirit."

Now, the enemy, with the end of the European war, is dreaming of moving troops east and launching a new blockade and strategy. This blockade and strategy is naturally more serious than the blockade by the Russian fleet forty years ago and the British, American, and Dutch military forces four years ago. However, the enemy has conveniently ignored the spiritual power that permeates the Japanese nation - this great "Naval Spirit," which cannot be blocked and suppressed by any material power. From General Toyoda, Commander-in-Chief of the Japanese Fleet, to every young Japanese soldier of the Kamikaze Special Attack Corps, that "must destroy the enemy upon sight," and the "Naval Spirit" of saving the country by sacrificing oneself as the highest and most supreme pleasure is an invincible model for the Eastern nation and something that white people, especially British and American imperialists, cannot dream of.

We firmly believe that with the high expression of the Japanese "Naval Spirit," all enemies in the Pacific will surely reach the final dead end.

### Enemy Forces in Okinawa Fall into Extreme Difficulty: Military Commentary Aims to Observe the War Situation

According to military commentators in this city, after observing the recent war situation in the Pacific and the European political situation, the details are as follows:

**Amami Island Defenses are Strong**

The Japanese defenses on Amami Oshima are strong. Recently, the enemy attacked with carrier-based aircraft, but they were strongly attacked by the Japanese garrison and fled without a trace. Northeast of Okinawa Island, there is an enemy mobile fleet, based on two regular aircraft carriers and four escort aircraft carriers. However, this mobile fleet lacks the support of convoys and cannot launch new operations. The enemy's operations in the southern part of Okinawa Island are in a state of stalemate. The Japanese forces are sending troops to guard against enemy landings in that area.

The enemy mobile fleet and warships around Okinawa Island have suffered serious damage from attacks by Japanese special attack forces. The land battles on Okinawa are also at a standstill. The enemy has repeatedly launched general offensives, hoping to break the deadlock, and used naval gunnery and aerial bombardment, but with little effect. Due to strong Japanese resistance, the enemy's strength is gradually being depleted, and they are experiencing great difficulties in terms of combat power.

Land battles in southern Okinawa are fierce, especially in the area in front of Shuri in the central part of the island. Because Japanese defenses are strong, the enemy's plans have been thwarted and they cannot achieve their goals. At the same time, the rainy season has made it impossible for the enemy to realize their initial operational plans, putting them in a very difficult situation.

**Fierce Battles on the Luzon Front**

Regarding the war situation on Luzon Island, fierce battles continue along the Cagayan Valley and the two lines from east of Ipo. The American casualties are quite serious. According to a statement issued by General MacArthur's headquarters on the 22nd of this month, Lieutenant General Tornden, Deputy Commander of the U.S. 25th Infantry Division, was killed in action on the Luzon front. The battles between the Japanese and American forces on Luzon Island have been ongoing for half a year since the start of the war and are still fierce. The Japanese forces have displayed their bravery, which has resulted in heavy American casualties and the war has become protracted. The enemy initially intended to resolve the Luzon operation and then reinforce their forces for operations in the north. Therefore, a major error has been found in the enemy's current war strategy.

Similarly, there are weaving machine battles in the southern islands of Mindanao, Tarakan in Sulawesi, and around Burma and Rangoon. The enemy's casualties continue to increase significantly, and they have suffered extreme damage.

**U.S. and Chongqing Cannot Reconcile Their Views**

Regarding the global political situation, the original goal of the San Francisco Conference was to establish principles for managing postwar world politics, but this goal has been almost completely lost. All that has been achieved is a security assurance mechanism, which is merely a form of international law and has limited effectiveness. This narrow security assurance mechanism is difficult to apply in North and South America, East Asia, and Europe, and is causing significant problems and disagreements.

It was previously reported that the Chongqing representative, Song Ziwen, would return to Chongqing via Moscow. Subsequently, Song returned to San Francisco from Washington on the 18th. During that week, Song served as the head of the delegation at the conference. During that time, Song was trying to reconcile the irreconcilable differences between the U.S. and Chongqing. The meaning of this is quite unfathomable.

**Many Problems with the War Against Japan**

Regarding the domestic political situation in the enemy country, with the European war militarily concluded, some people in the enemy country deeply feel that peace is imminent. Government officials also have many illusions. Therefore, although there have been repeated announcements about continuing the war against Japan, there are actually many underlying problems. Even though the European war is over, domestic disputes will intensify and various factions will be in conflict. Therefore, the future of continuing the war against Japan is questionable.

### Two Central American Countries to Merge

Lisbon, 24th (Central News Agency) - A Washington dispatch states that U.S. President Truman announced yesterday that U.S. government officials have been changed. Secretary of Agriculture Wickard, Secretary of Labor Perkins, and Attorney General Biddle have all left their positions.

### Syria Conscripts Troops

Lisbon, 24th (Central News Agency) - According to Reuters from Damascus, Syria has begun conscripting troops in response to unforeseen events. A dispatch from Beirut states that many students there are demonstrating against France. The governments of the United Kingdom and the United States have not officially commented on the French military occupation. However, an editorial in the London Times on the 23rd criticized the French actions.

**The Situation in France and Syria is Improving**

Lisbon, 24th (Central News Agency) - According to a British reporter stationed in Cairo yesterday, Cairo authorities are hopeful that the disputes between France and Syria and Lebanon will be resolved. British and American diplomatic circles are very concerned about the development of these disputes. The Syrian Foreign Minister met with the U.S. envoy to Egypt, Duke, yesterday. It is believed that the only advice from the British and American authorities on this issue will be "restore harmony and develop an optimistic future."

**Major Riot in Algeria**

Tokyo, 24th (Central News Agency) - According to a Rome radio station citing an unconfirmed announcement from Madrid, a major riot has occurred in Algeria, resulting in approximately three thousand deaths and injuries, as well as significant losses. It is reported that the French troops stationed there have begun military operations.

### The Uniqueness of Island Warfare

The U.S. Third Army under Patton, when it initially landed in Europe and advanced toward Paris, did not wait for follow-up troops on the plains of Normandy but charged straight toward Paris. Tactically speaking, this was an unreasonable advance. A United Press reporter even warned loudly that this situation was "a gun barrel without a stock entering France." However, this mechanized unit, primarily composed of tanks, finally advanced into Paris. At the time, the gun stock wasn't on the ground; it was in the air. Replenishment from the air showed that air superiority was the gun stock. To understand the characteristics of modern warfare, one only needs to look at the examples of the Greater East Asia War to see that the enemy, the Americans, disregarded everything in their counterattack and used a "gun barrel with a sky stock" to thrust forward.

Nimitz jumped from Makin Island and Tarawa Island to the Marshall Islands, then leaped to Saipan and Iwo Jima, finally obtaining air bases close to Japan. All of this was for the purpose of securing air superiority, a "javelin-throwing" strategy. This form of head-to-head warfare has been completely broken by American tactics. Current warfare often involves leaps from one point to another, a battle for strategic points. In this respect, one can see the uniqueness of island warfare.

**All-Out Warfare**

Seizing air bases closest to the Japanese mainland is the goal of the impatient American counterattack. After the enemy Americans occupied Saipan, it became a major base for B-29 bombers to attack the Japanese mainland. Furthermore, the occupation of Iwo Jima was equivalent to Japan handing over a base for American P-51s to invade Japan. Without pausing for breath, the enemy Americans landed on Okinawa. This means that it is difficult to expect to deploy a large-scale air force using only one-sided bombing bases like Saipan and Iwo Jima. If the enemy wants to deploy a large-scale air force and completely destroy the Japanese mainland, then another line of attack is absolutely necessary. This is the purpose of the Okinawa operation. From this perspective, what the Americans want is to turn islands into bases. So, how many troops and what kind of weapons has the enemy sent to seize this base?

According to enemy announcements, the forces needed for the Iwo Jima landing were 60,000 sailors and 800 ships (220,000 personnel). During the Lingayen landing, 1,033 ships were used. The mobile fleet for the Kerama Islands landing consisted of 15 aircraft carriers, 11 battleships, 10 cruisers, and 32 destroyers, a total of 68 ships.

The firepower of naval gunnery is very great because the firepower of one battleship is actually equal to that of five divisions, which is equivalent to the bombing power of 1,200 Japanese twin-engine light bombers. One cruiser is equal to one ten-howitzer, 325 light bombers; one destroyer is equal to two twelve-howitzer batteries, 69 light bombers. It is said that for the Okinawa operation, the enemy mobilized all the fleets in the Pacific. However, the Japanese Kamikaze special attack forces, by April 17th, had sunk 13 aircraft carriers, 10 battleships, 9 cruisers, and 6 destroyers. This is equivalent to sending 1,000 aircraft to the bottom of the sea and, in terms of firepower, destroying more than 50 divisions. If one adds the results achieved by Japanese battleships, cruisers, and aircraft carriers, the number would certainly be much larger. However, the enemy is not discouraged by this and continues to pour troops into the Okinawa battlefield to fight to the finish. If island warfare is determined by the amount of troops, firepower, and national strength that is poured in, then the enemy will certainly pour in their final combat strength. Naturally, Japan must also pour all its strength into the decisive battle on Okinawa.

**Base and Aircraft Carrier**

"Gaining air superiority" is the key to deciding air control, which is a natural truth. However, the quantity of aircraft does not directly determine the outcome of air combat. Currently, one should not neglect the decisive factor of base conditions. The Okinawa battlefield has not yet decided who has air superiority. To remedy this, the enemy landed on Ie Island. This is an attempt to shift from aircraft carriers to land bases. In other words, the Japanese air force, mainly composed of special attack aircraft, holds air control over the main island of Okinawa, while the enemy Americans, with aircraft carriers as their main runways, hold air control. With victories and defeats alternating, the enemy is always anxious to gain control of the base. The strategic and tactical advantages and disadvantages of land bases and aircraft carriers, according to the current state of air combat, cannot be determined. It is like fighting by throwing stones at each other, one on a slope and one below. The slope represents the advantageous land base, but if the stones thrown from below are more numerous than the stones thrown from above, then the person below will have the advantage. If the strength of the aircraft carrier is superior to that of the land base in terms of the quantity of aircraft and bombs, then the combat power of the two will be equal or even exceed the base's capabilities.

On the Okinawa battlefield, even though the enemy's aircraft carrier strength cannot defeat Japan, they want to land on Ie Island to acquire a land base. The enemy Americans are increasingly resorting to desperate measures to secure air control.

**Replenishment Decisive Battle**

The final decision will be made by replenishment. There are six basic elements that determine air combat: attack power, quality, replenishment, bases, the quality of pilots, and intelligence. Among these six elements, the most important can be said to be replenishment. All the elements of victory require replenishment. Enormous consumption naturally requires replenishment. Replenishment in air combat, in particular, can be said to be absolute.

The enemy's frenzied attack on Okinawa means that the enemy has lengthened the replenishment route. Okinawa is 10,000 kilometers away from the United States. Each American soldier needs about 16 tons of food and ammunition every ten days. The United States has landed seven divisions of troops on Okinawa Island. Calculating the tonnage of ammunition and food consumed by this number, it will probably be at least 1.1 million tons. This would require 200 freighters with a capacity of 5,000 tons. For this transport, the enemy must travel between the United States and Okinawa three times a month. But the enemy has already lost more than 60 transport ships around Okinawa Island. The enemy's replenishment has already fallen into a quagmire. But Japan's replenishment is very easy because it is only a narrow strip of water from Japan.

The replenishment battle is absolutely advantageous to Japan. War will certainly lead to the failure of one side, and this is due to the frustration of replenishment. We, Japan, must not have replenishment setbacks in the final decisive battle on Okinawa, no matter what.

**Special Attack Force**

The sorties of the special attack forces have overturned the previous understanding of air control. Despite the enemy American control of the air, the special attack forces flew out without regard for anything. Disrupting the enemy's air control, the enemy then actively replenished night fighters on the aircraft carriers, attempting to maintain air control, but it was all in vain. The American theory of large-scale air control lost its authority in the face of the special attack force's attack.

In order to give the enemy a fatal blow, we ask the people to work hard to produce a quantity of special attack forces. As long as we have a quantity of special attack forces, then there is no need to worry about air control over Okinawa Island. (Translated from the May 1st Asahi Shimbun)

### Water and Electricity Company Hopes Citizens Will Voluntarily Conserve Water: Users Who Want to Adjust Limits Can Contact the Company

The city's water supply problem has recently become quite serious, and various forces are paying close attention. The Shanghai Water Branch of the China Water and Electricity Company has issued a statement on the current water supply situation: After the implementation of water consumption limits, many users have exceeded their limits because they cannot voluntarily conserve water, resulting in fines. This is a passive warning method. Fines for exceeding water limits are specifically used for water supply construction. Because the general public does not fully understand the meaning of water fines, they repeatedly exceed the water consumption limits. The company's original intention in imposing fines was to encourage users to voluntarily conserve water in the future and avoid increasing fines, but the effect has been minimal. As summer approaches, the demand for water will gradually increase. If users need to adjust their limits due to actual needs, they can come to the company to negotiate. The company will absolutely accept opinions to find a solution. Because water supply is of great importance to people's livelihoods, the company is reluctant to cut off water to users who exceed their limits, but hopes that they will voluntarily make every effort to conserve water.

**Air Defense Headquarters Encourages Well Digging**

The City Air Defense Headquarters, in view of the fact that enemy aircraft are repeatedly invading Shanghai and water supply is likely to be interrupted at any time, and that water consumption is currently limited, making it difficult for citizens to obtain water, has taken measures to encourage residents to dig wells. It is stipulated that during the "Strengthened Air Defense Facilities Week" from June 1st to 9th, the cost of digging wells for citizens will be specially reduced, with each well costing approximately 300,000 national currency. The Rongxing Well Digging Company has been contacted and the matter is settled. It is hoped that citizens will respond to this call to make the city's air defense posture more perfect.

### Two Exhibitions Scheduled to Open Today: Ocean Art Exhibition

### County and District Administrative Meetings Scheduled Regularly

Since its establishment, the City County Administration Office, in addition to rectifying the discipline of county police forces and strengthening police measures at any time, has also actively planned for the reform and improvement of county administration in order to increase administrative efficiency and coordinate with municipal measures. It is reported that in order to strengthen the administration of various counties and districts, the office has issued a notice to its subordinates to convene a county and district administrative meeting at the City Hall auditorium on June 15 to discuss matters that should be promoted and reformed.

### City Government Forbids Establishment of Poultry Markets

The City Government has repeatedly received petitions from citizens requesting the establishment of a Shanghai Poultry Market. Previously, it instructed the Economic Bureau to investigate and reply, stating that since the market had not been inspected by the bureau and its business operations had not been carried out in accordance with the Provisional Regulations for the Supervision of Privately Operated Markets, there were obvious legal discrepancies. Furthermore, it was found that during the preparation period of the market, it had been repeatedly accused by other businesses. Upon review of its articles of incorporation, it was found that most of the founders were outsiders to the industry, and that the business plan did not focus on procurement, transportation, and distribution of goods. The sole purpose was to collect handling fees and monopolize the market, which would not help to suppress commodity prices. There was absolutely no need to establish the market. The Economic Bureau was instructed to order the cessation of preparations and report to the Ministry of Industry for review. Now, citizens Zhang Hao and others have submitted a petition requesting permission to establish the market, but it is reported that the City Government has again rejected the request.

### Citywide Bicycle Management Stations to be Established

The Prevention Section of the Third Division of the City Police Bureau, in view of the rampant theft of bicycles in the city, has contacted the Traffic Section of the Third Division of the bureau and the Construction Bureau to establish bicycle management stations throughout all districts of the city. Detailed measures are being actively planned, and will be implemented as soon as they are finalized.

### Strictly Prohibit Merchants from Evading Income Tax

The Ministry of Finance, in view of the fact that some unscrupulous merchants are evading income tax by falsely claiming to be Japanese merchants, has requested the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to consult with the Japanese Embassy to instruct consulates in various places to strictly crack down on this practice. After receiving the aforementioned ministerial orders, the City Income Tax Bureau has instructed all collection offices to take note.

### Laoza District Police Station to Patrol All Night

The head of the Laoza District Police Station, Xu, and the deputy head of the police station, Ito Tadatsu, felt uneasy about the repeated thefts in the area. Starting today (25th), they have organized a night patrol team, divided into a north team and a south team with Nanjing Road as the boundary. Each team will be led by a police officer and will patrol continuously every night to ensure that the residents in the area can live and work in peace. In order to encourage their subordinates to work diligently and conscientiously, the head and deputy head of the police station summoned the officers of the two teams and carefully explained the true meaning of police duty, so that the people's taxes would not be wasted and the government officials would not be idle.

### Developing Dongting West Mountain

— Tang Yi

Evacuation Preparations

Since Dongting West Mountain was designated as an evacuation area for Shanghai's population, various preparations have been steadily progressing. The Jiangsu Provincial Government, in order to fully assist, first transferred capable and cooperative district chiefs from the Wu County Government. The new district chief, Mr. Jin Zidi, is familiar with the local situation and is quite effective in handling matters. According to the Suzhou Office of the Evacuation Committee, the work currently underway includes the following:

Training Self-Defense Forces: The current security situation in Dongting West Mountain, from a general observation, can be considered very peaceful. The new district chief, in order to strengthen the people's self-defense capabilities, has started to organize able-bodied men and establish patrol teams at night. He is also preparing to further organize and train the local 5,000 coal miners, so that the safety of those who evacuate here in the future will be worry-free.

Stockpiling Food: Dongting West Mountain is isolated in Tai Lake. Because the area does not produce grain, once external transportation is affected, there will inevitably be panic about food. Therefore, the district office is currently leading a grain stockpiling campaign, with the goal of always preparing enough rice, wheat, and miscellaneous grains for two months.

Registering Houses: The Dongting West Mountain Branch Office of the Evacuation Committee, in cooperation with the district office and township chiefs, has registered local houses, limiting each household to a certain number of people and allowing them to use only a certain number of houses. Beyond this limit, they must rent the excess houses to evacuees at a fair price determined by the government. This registration is expected to be completed by the end of this month.

Construction Plans

With the assistance of the Jiangsu Provincial Government, various difficulties in the evacuation work are being resolved one by one. The most problematic and worrying issue for most people is the problem of finding work and settlement after evacuating to Dongting Mountain.

It is remembered that when Mr. Xiang Kangyuan proposed Dongting Mountain as an evacuation area, he pointed out that evacuation should not be regarded merely as an active act of "fleeing disaster," but as a permanent development and construction undertaking, involving the relocation of part of Shanghai's human and material resources to the area. The Jiangsu Provincial Government also attaches great importance to this and is studying plans.

Looking at the environment of Dongting West Mountain, one can see that the aforementioned development work is not without a future. The mountain has a vast land and a sparse population, with many empty spaces. What is particularly noteworthy is that the mineral reserves are extremely rich. If it is used as an evacuation area for small factories, schools, or residential areas, it would be very suitable.

For example, the Baoshan and Baocheng coal mines currently use rudimentary methods to mine coal, but still produce 3,000 tons per month. At 100,000 yuan per ton, the monthly output is worth 300 million yuan, while the monthly expenditure is said to be less than 200 million yuan, resulting in a very small profit. With coal, power generation is not a problem. When establishing a factory, it is often necessary to choose one of three types of locations: the source of raw materials, the location of sales markets, or a place where fuel and labor costs are low. Dongting West Mountain's fuel is not a problem, and labor costs are much cheaper than in the city because food is relatively cheaper. According to various investigations, in addition to coal, there are also metal ores such as copper ore that have not yet been developed, which is the first point worth noting.

Secondly, the local waterway transportation is very developed, surrounded by areas that produce grain and agricultural products. Rice, wheat, silk, tea, and fishery products are all special products of Jiangsu and Zhejiang, and it is very promising to process them as raw materials. At the same time, the nearby areas are all wealthy areas, with no shortage of sales markets.

Thirdly, Dongting West Mountain is an isolated island, easy to maintain security, and the environment is also simple. After workers and students move to the area, there is less external material temptation, and they can concentrate on work and study. This point may not seem important on the surface, but it is worth considering for establishing factories and schools.

The Jiangsu Provincial Construction Department has drafted a plan to develop Dongting West Mountain as a model autonomous region, preparing to build Dongting West Mountain into a pre-war Hong Kong, such as building shipyards, light railways, and establishing factories. Only the problem of funds remains to be solved, and it is hoped that entrepreneurs with strong financial resources in Shanghai will actively invest, and the future will be unlimited. The Jiangsu Provincial Government is also making various preparations for factory sites, security, transportation, etc., which are all very practical assistance.

### Loan Fund for Medical Treatment: Two More Designated Hospitals Added

From the 23rd of last month to yesterday, within one month, 43 people were approved for loans from the Loan Fund for Medical Treatment, totaling 3,000,850 yuan, with the most being employees of industrial and commercial enterprises and teachers and students. All but one person who died have recovered and been discharged from the hospital. The designated hospitals have been particularly considerate to patients applying for loans, appropriately reducing medical expenses. In order to facilitate patients in the northern and western areas of Shanghai, the Shanghai Health Sanatorium on Wujin Road and the Ximen Women and Children's Hospital at 850 Xujiahui Road have been added as designated hospitals, and personnel are sent to the hospitals from time to time to express sympathy. Patients with the following qualifications can apply for loans:

Employees and technicians of factories and shops, teachers and staff of schools, internal affairs soldiers of post offices and customs, direct relatives and formal spouses of the above three types of personnel (unemployed persons with valid proof may also apply), students (limited to woodmen). Those who suffer from urgent internal medicine diseases and require urgent surgical operations, and are unable to afford medical treatment, can apply at the office located in the Xinzheng Industrial Company, Room 319, 3rd Floor, No. 89 Sima Road (intersection of Sichuan Road), from 10:00 AM to 5:00 PM daily (excluding Sundays and holidays). In case of emergency that cannot be delayed, patients can first enter a designated hospital for treatment and complete the application procedures after obtaining a doctor's diagnosis.

### Donating Salaries to Aid Fire Victims and Out-of-School Children

Mr. Huang Lizheng, Zhang Jianhuang, Liang Xiaoyou, Xu Zhishan, and Huang Zhijie wrote: "The fire on Yuyao Road was a terrible disaster, with thousands of people homeless. Fortunately, your newspaper is enthusiastic about public welfare and has taken the lead in providing relief. We cannot shirk our responsibility and are willing to donate our weekly salaries, totaling 200,000 yuan, with 100,000 yuan donated to the Yuyao Road fire relief fund and another 100,000 yuan donated to your newspaper's 'Education Fund.' This is a small contribution, but it expresses our sincere intentions. We hope you will take this into consideration."

Charity Sale Profits Donated to Scholarship Fund

The Student Self-Government Association of the Ningbo Fellow Villagers Association in Shanghai wrote: "Your newspaper's establishment of free elementary schools has achieved very satisfactory results. It has indeed brought many benefits to society and the country! In addition to the students of our school each making efforts to save pocket money and successively donating to the charity school fund, several members of our association have also launched a charity market. The situation on the day of the event was quite enthusiastic. Everyone, based on the spirit of contributing money and goods, eventually made a net profit of 58,380 yuan. Although the amount is small, it expresses our enthusiasm. We hope that enthusiastic people in society will pay widespread attention and actively discuss and promote, so that the entire Shanghai can complete the network of charity schools, and then the days of eliminating the poor illiterate will come."

Wedding Confectionery Expenses Used to Aid Medical Fund

Yesterday, Mr. Lu's family sent 200,000 national currency (Guo Bi), in order to save the expenses of wedding confectionery on the wedding of Mr. Lu Qizhuang and Ms. Hu Xingjue, and transferred it to the Small School Medical Aid Fund of this office. Mr. Lu's frugality in helping the good and benefiting the poor is of profound significance.

Extended Deadline for Lake County Hidden Poverty Loan

The Lake County Fellow Villagers Association in Shanghai previously launched a hidden poverty loan, and the application period was set to end on the 22nd of this month. However, in recent days, fellow villagers have still been coming to the association to apply. In order to achieve universality, the application period has been extended to the afternoon of the 25th, and will not be extended any further. Hidden poor fellow villagers from Lake County in Shanghai can bring their residence permits to the association on the second floor of No. 263 Guizhou Road to apply.
