### U.S. Earnestly Hopes Our Nation Can Eliminate Disputes and Achieve Unification, Laying the Foundation for World Peace and Prosperity

[Reuters, Washington, 16th] President Truman, two hours before Ambassador Marshall departed for China, issued a detailed statement elaborating on the United States' policy towards China. The President emphasized that the U.S. would continue to recognize the National Government as the sole legal government of China and hoped that the conflict between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party could be resolved promptly. He also urged the swift convening of a conference of representatives from all parties and factions to study concrete measures for resolving the disputes. Furthermore, according to responsible sources, the President's statement implied that the U.S. was prepared to lend China a substantial sum of 200 million yuan, with terms no less favorable than those of British credit loans. In addition, the U.S. also planned to send thousands of technical personnel to assist China in its reconstruction efforts. It is expected that Ambassador Marshall will bring to Chongqing more concrete plans than those outlined in the President's statement.

### Truman's Statement: U.S. Policy Toward China

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 16th] Washington, 15th (United Press) – U.S. President Truman today issued a statement on U.S. policy toward China. The full text is as follows: The U.S. Government believes that in this new and unexplored era, world peace and prosperity depend on the ability of sovereign nations to work together within the United Nations organization to achieve collective security. The U.S. Government firmly believes that a strong, unified, and democratic China is essential for the success of the United Nations organization and for world peace. A China disrupted by foreign aggression, as in the past by Japan, or by the chaos and division resulting from intense internal strife, will be a source of potential disruption to stability and peace in the world today and in the future. The principle long adhered to by the U.S. Government is that the handling of domestic affairs is the responsibility of the people of each sovereign nation. Events of this century have shown that the disruption of peace in any corner of the world is sufficient to threaten the peace of the entire world. Therefore, for the paramount interests of the United States and all United Nations, the Chinese people must not neglect the opportunity to reconcile domestic differences immediately through peaceful negotiation. The U.S. Government firmly believes that the most important things are: (1) The armies of the National Government of China and the Chinese Communist Party, as well as other armed forces holding divergent views, should find ways to stop military conflict in order to achieve the complete return of all of China to effective Chinese rule, including the immediate withdrawal of Japanese troops. (2) A national conference with representatives from all major political elements should seek ways to resolve the current domestic disputes as soon as possible, that is, to promote a solution to unify our China.

### Assist Our Government in Disarming Japanese Troops, Advocate for a Consultative Conference of All Parties, Unify Military Command and Eliminate Independent Armies

The United States and other United Nations have recognized the current National Government of China as the sole legal government within China. The National Government of China is the appropriate institution for achieving the goal of a unified China. The United States and the United Kingdom, based on the 1943 Cairo Declaration, and the Soviet Union, based on its participation in the Potsdam Declaration of July of this year and the Sino-Soviet Treaty and Agreements of August of this year, have all made pledges to assist China in its liberation, including the return of the Northeast to Chinese rule. All of the aforementioned agreements were concluded with the National Government of China. In order to continue the close cooperation with the National Government of China, which it had established in the past to carry out the war, and in accordance with the Potsdam Declaration and to eliminate the possibility of Japanese forces remaining in China, the United States is undertaking a definite obligation in disarming Japanese troops and removing them from China. Therefore, the United States has assisted the National Government in disarming and withdrawing Japanese troops in the recovered areas and will continue to do so. The U.S. Marine Corps is currently in North China for this reason. The United States currently and in the future recognizes the National Government of China and cooperates with the National Government of China in international matters, especially in eliminating Japanese forces within China. The United States firmly believes that in order to achieve this goal, a cessation of military conflict must be sought quickly. The support of the United States will not extend to U.S. military intervention to influence any Chinese civil war. The United States has been compelled to restore peace at a great price, which was first disrupted by Japan's invasion of the Northeast. Unless Japan's forces in China are thoroughly eliminated, and unless China becomes a unified, democratic, and prosperous nation, the peace of the Pacific will either become a bubble or may be disrupted. This is the purpose of the temporary stay of the U.S. Army and Navy in China. The United States is aware that the current National Government of China is a "one-party government" and believes that if the foundation of this government can be broadened to include other political elements in the country, it will promote China's peaceful unification and democratic reform. Therefore, the United States strongly advocates a national conference held by representatives of all major political elements in the country to discuss ways to ensure that these political elements can participate fairly and effectively in the National Government of China. To this end, the U.S. Government believes that the "one-party tutelage" established by Sun Yat-sen, the father of the nation, as a temporary measure in the process of national democracy, should be revised. The existence of independent armies, such as the Communist army, is contrary to China's political unity and, in reality, makes China's political unity impossible. When a broadly representative government is established, independent armies should be eliminated, and all armed forces within China should be effectively integrated into the Chinese National Army. Based on its repeatedly stated position on self-determination in the past, the U.S. Government believes that the detailed steps to achieve political unity should be determined by the Chinese people themselves, and any foreign government intervention in this matter is inappropriate. The U.S. Government deeply feels that China has a clear responsibility to other United Nations, that is, to stop armed conflict within its territory, as it threatens world stability and peace. This responsibility must be shared by the National Government and all political and military groups in China.

### Marshall May Arrive in Shanghai First

[Central News Agency, This City Dispatch] Regarding the speculation about where U.S. Ambassador to China, Marshal Marshall, will arrive in China first, there are conflicting reports. The reporter has inquired with relevant U.S. authorities, who stated that no official confirmation has been received as of now. It is expected that Marshall may arrive in China around the 20th of this month. Reports from various sources state that he is expected to arrive in Chongqing on the 20th, but since many U.S. generals are concentrated in Shanghai, it seems very likely that Marshall will first come to Shanghai for a visit. Life Magazine has already assigned photographerラックス to cover the news of Marshall's arrival in China.

### U.S. Has Prepared Loans for Our Nation

As China moves towards the path of peace and unity as described above, the United States is prepared to assist the National Government in every reasonable way in nation-building, improving its agricultural and industrial economy, and establishing its military system so that it can fulfill China's responsibility to maintain peace and order for itself and for the international community. To further the above-mentioned assistance, the United States will be prepared to give favorable consideration to China's request for credit and cash loans under reasonable terms to help China's plan to develop a sound national economic system and healthy Sino-American trade relations.

### National Government Order

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 16th] National Government Telegram on the 16th: (1) The Executive Yuan's request to posthumously award the late officers Zhang Dafei and Long Zezhe the rank of Air Force Captain should be approved. This order. (2) Zhu Shaohuang, a technician in the Ministry of Health currently on probation, has another assignment. Zhu Shaohuang should be dismissed from his position. This order.

### Chairman Chiang's Address to Students of Major Middle Schools in Peiping at the Hall of Supreme Harmony

Revolutionary youth, under the poisoning and oppression of the enemy and puppet regime, have struggled arduously and unyieldingly for the Three Principles of the People and the personality of the nation. Now that the War of Resistance has been won, it is a great comfort for me to meet my revolutionary youth in Peiping. This is not only the greatest comfort in my life but also the most memorable event in Chinese history. (Applause) However, countless youths have been killed and abused to death by the enemy and puppet regime during these eight years. Now that I have come to Peiping, I am unable to meet them. My grief is beyond words. I hope that my surviving youth will take on the responsibility, know shame and strive, work hard to strengthen themselves, and realize the Three Principles of the People to fulfill their unfulfilled aspirations. (Applause) Now that nation-building has begun, my youth must strive to be followers of the Premier and masters of the country. They must follow the instructions I will give below and put them into practice to achieve their goals.

Promote National Spirit and Restore National Ethics

First, we must promote the national spirit and restore national ethics. Our Republic of China is a nation of etiquette, and our nation is one that values ethics. The spirit of its founding lies in the two words "loyalty" and "filial piety." All descendants of the Yellow Emperor should be loyal to the country and loyal to the cause, filial to the nation and filial to their parents. During our country's War of Resistance, we relied on the spirit of loyalty and filial piety of our compatriots to sacrifice themselves for righteousness and take life for righteousness, so we were able to turn defeat into victory and turn danger into safety. In the future, I hope that my youth will carry forward this spirit, obey orders, strictly abide by discipline, and, under the leadership of the government, build our China into a free and independent country. (Applause)

Read "China's Destiny" and Complete the Five Kinds of Construction

Read "China's Destiny" and complete the five kinds of construction. In my book "China's Destiny," I explained that China's construction must be based on ethics, psychology, politics, economics, and society. And these five kinds of construction require my revolutionary youth to be the backbone. Today, I am entrusting the responsibility of nation-building to my revolutionary youth. I hope that my youth will respect, cherish, stand on their own, and strengthen themselves to shoulder this important responsibility. (Applause)

Break Down Selfish Concepts and Cultivate a Spirit of Love

Third, we must break down the concept of selfishness and cultivate a spirit of love and unity. The shortcoming of our Chinese nation in the past lies in the fact that individuals have selfish hearts and lack a concept of the country and the nation. Therefore, it is like a heap of loose sand, inviting the enemy's aggression. In the future, to complete the great cause of nation-building, all of our compatriots must gather under the banner of the Three Principles of the People, love each other, unite as one, help each other, cooperate, and fight to the end in order to achieve our goals. Finally, I hope that my youth will understand the meaning of strengthening the nation must first strengthen the race, exercise their bodies, and pay attention to health, so that they are worthy of being upright descendants of the Yellow Emperor, and then they can undertake all difficult and arduous work. As for the suffering in your lives and the difficulties of the schools, I am always concerned and have instructed the educational authorities of Peiping to do their duty and strive to improve them. I hope that my youth will concentrate on their studies and work hard to improve themselves, so that they are worthy of being sound revolutionary cadres and fulfill your mission of implementing the cause of building the country.

### Chairman Will Inspect Nanking, Speech to Peiping Students in the Hall of Supreme Harmony, Two Myriad Youths Show Great Enthusiasm

[This Newspaper, Peiping, 16th] Related sources said that the next inspection site of the Chairman may be Nanking and that it may be possible to leave around the 17th or 18th. Also, the Chairman's office announced that it had accepted petitions from the people. In the past few days, citizens have been enthusiastically posting letters designated for this purpose at the post office. Some have even traveled from Tientsin by car to post letters. As of 9:00 PM on the 15th, the mailbox outside Qianmen was filled with four large boxes, the post office at Xisi Pailou had two large boxes, and the other three locations each had one box, estimated to be about 10,000 letters in total.

[This Newspaper, Peiping, 16th] (From Our Correspondent) There was a pleasant commotion in the Hall of Supreme Harmony in the Forbidden City today, as Chairman Chiang was enthusiastically surrounded by over two myriad young men and women. At 10:30 AM, after Chairman Chiang finished speaking, he stepped down from the Hall of Supreme Harmony amid thunderous cheers and applause. As he was amiably shaking hands with two young girls holding the school flag, over two myriad students immediately gathered around him like iron filings attracted to a magnet. The surrounding guards quickly pushed the Chairman back into the Hall, but he seemed to like the young boys and girls, and he immediately turned around and went down the Hall to comfort the children on the west side. This time, the children rushed up like a tide breaking through a dam, and in just a few minutes, they had surrounded the Chairman. Some of the more courageous ones went straight forward and shook hands with the Chairman. The atmosphere at the scene was chaotic and pleasant. The cheers of "Long live Chairman Chiang" rose and fell. All kinds of hats were thrown into the air. The guards managed to clear a path through the impenetrable crowd and helped the Chairman back to the Hall. Unexpectedly, the unsatisfied crowd followed, and the vast Hall of Supreme Harmony became a sea of black heads. Even the stone lions and bronze cranes were decorated with people. This pleasant commotion lasted for a full quarter of an hour. The Chairman was then escorted out of the venue by Chief of Staff Sun Yingzhong and General Dai Li. However, Chief of Staff Sun's foot was sprained by the enthusiastic children. General Dai's hat was covered with many beads of sweat. The children happily dispersed from the venue. Although many of them had their hats pulled off or their shoes stepped on today, those who had shaken hands with the Chairman were envied by their classmates. Today, the Chairman's speech lasted for 15 minutes. The Chairman was in military uniform, wearing a yellow-green wool cloak, and his face was radiant. He smiled amiably throughout the chaotic encirclement of the youth. Except for a few whiskers under his military hat, he did not look old at all.

[Central News Agency, Peiping, 16th] Chairman Chiang summoned students from major middle schools in the city to give a speech in the Hall of Supreme Harmony at 10:00 AM on the 16th. Over eighteen thousand students from the city attended. The Chairman arrived at the Hall of Supreme Harmony at 9:50 AM, wearing a military uniform. He slowly ascended the platform, and all the students cheered and applauded for five minutes without stopping. The Chairman waved frequently in response and delivered a speech. After the speech, he reviewed the city again, and all the students were overjoyed. Some students even surged out of the ranks, as if wanting to pour out the mental oppression and pain of the past eight years to the Chairman. The Chairman was kind and compassionate, and he shook hands with the nearby students to show his comfort. (The original text of the Chairman's speech is in the lower right corner).

### Chairman and Madame Inspect U.S. Troops, Award Medals to More Than Twenty Officers and Soldiers

[Associated Press, Peiping, 16th] Chairman and Madame Chiang made their first public appearance today, inspecting the ranks of the U.S. Overseas Troops Fifth Regiment near the embassy district in Peiping and awarding medals to more than twenty officers and soldiers. The ceremony proceeded smoothly. When the Chairman and Madame drove to the parade ground, thousands of people were eager to catch a glimpse of them. The Chairman stood exposed in the strong north wind blowing from the Mongolian grassland. The wind was so strong that dust filled the sky and once blew off the helmet of a U.S. soldier. Madame Chiang and three Red Cross nurses took refuge in the car of Major General Lockett, Commander of U.S. Forces in North China. Lockett and his Chief of Staff, Walton, Jones, the U.S. commander in the Peiping area, and many of his officers and soldiers were awarded the Medal of the Brilliant Star by the Chairman in recognition of their assistance in repatriating surrendered Japanese soldiers. Four others were commended for their achievements in the battles of Okinawa and Palau. The overseas troops were in full military uniform, carrying tank destroyers, howitzers, and flat-trajectory guns, passing in front of the Chairman. Fifty U.S. military police and many Chinese military police were responsible for protecting the Chairman. Thirty-six "Corsair" fighter planes, divided into twelve rows, flew over the venue. After the inspection, the Chairman attended a reception hosted by Major General Lockett and gave a brief speech on the U.S. military radio station. The Chairman invited U.S. officers and soldiers to watch Peking Opera tonight.

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 16th] The Executive Yuan, noting that personnel from various agencies under its jurisdiction who are taking over property in various locations are refusing to return property that was forcibly seized by the enemy and puppet regime from the people, or are forcibly occupying it under various pretexts, has ordered strict correction of this situation.

Otherwise, strict action will be taken in accordance with the law.

### Kunming Associated University and Yunnan University Still Awaiting Persuasion to Resume Classes

[Central News Agency, Kunming, 16th] The student unrest in this city had already improved after Vice Minister of Education Zhu Jingnong arrived in Kunming to handle the situation. Professors from Associated University and Yunnan University had all agreed to resume classes on the 17th and had repeatedly persuaded students to resume classes. Chairman Lu had also summoned student representatives twice to explain the situation thoroughly. However, the Student Strike Committee was apparently controlled by more than twenty people who repeatedly changed their demands. For example, regarding the issue of the burial of deceased students, it was originally decided by faculty, staff, and student representatives to bury them in the school cemetery, and workers had already been hired. However, the Strike Committee demanded that they be reburied in Heilongtan and opposed the decided burial date. Furthermore, the Strike Committee spread propaganda externally, even using slogans to incite the people to "not pay taxes." Therefore, the resumption of classes on the 17th is still problematic, but the authorities and professors of each school are making every effort to persuade them.

For the past three months, Wang has not taken off his clothes, his hair is three inches long, and he is dressed in farmer's attire, looking like a simpleton. His force of approximately 8,000 men has been fighting in southern Shandong for several years. On August 15th, after "Japan's surrender," Wang's force was already under siege by the Communist army for half a month. When the Japanese army withdrew from Linfen, Wang divided a portion of his troops to garrison Linfen City, which was then besieged by the Communist army for over a month. This unit perished entirely along with Linfen City. Subsequently, the Communist army continued to besiege Wang's base for more than three months. When Wang led his troops to break through the encirclement, there were still forty soldiers, but unfortunately, they were ambushed again by the Communist army on their way to Zaozhuang, resulting in heavy casualties. Currently, the remaining troops have reached the vicinity of Zaozhuang to rest and await orders, while Wang has come to Jinan alone to report. All sectors are preparing a grand welcome.

### Ringleader of the Invasion of China Meets Such an End: Konoe Commits Suicide by Poison Yesterday; Apparently Seeking to Avoid Exposing Secrets that Would Implicate the Emperor

[Our Newspaper, Tokyo, 16th, Urgent Telegram] Konoe Fumimaro committed suicide by poison at his private residence on Suganami-dori, Oginzato, on Saturday. The news has deeply impressed the Japanese people. Konoe was the number one ringleader in launching the war of aggression against China. He became deeply depressed after learning that MacArthur's headquarters had declared him a war criminal. According to a fifteen-year-old servant in his house, Konoe, after hearing that he was on the list of war criminals and that Yamashita Tomoyuki had been sentenced to hanging, drew several kinds of gallows on paper, expressing great fear of the pain of hanging. On the evening of the 15th, he committed suicide by taking poison. When the reporter rushed to Konoe's private residence at 5:30 PM this evening, US military police were already guarding the front door. About thirty United Nations reporters were crowded outside Konoe's bedroom. Konoe's wife, Chiyoko, and his son were weeping on the scene. It was reported that she had discussed with her husband last night how to manage family matters after he went to prison, and went to bed at 2:00 AM. She said that her husband's condition was normal at the time and there was nothing unusual. It was not until 5:00 AM this morning that she discovered that he had committed suicide by poisoning in his study, facing the inner garden. His son also interjected that when he discovered his father's suicide, he immediately called a doctor for emergency treatment, but it was too late, and he died at 9:15 AM this morning. Konoe's body is currently being guarded by US military police. When the reporter inspected his house, he saw that the walls of the room were covered with calligraphy scrolls, all handwritten by major Chinese traitors, such as Wang Jingwei and Chen Gongbo.

[Reuters, Tokyo, 16th] MacArthur's headquarters announced today that Konoe Fumimaro committed suicide by poison on Saturday night. Konoe was 54 years old, born into an aristocratic family, and served as Prime Minister of Japan three times. At the time of his death, he was still Minister without Portfolio and a member of the War Liquidation Committee. The deceased was Prime Minister shortly before the Pearl Harbor incident. Konoe was one of the main culprits in launching the war against China. Prime Minister Shidehara told a special correspondent of our agency: "Konoe's death was unexpected. I believe the deceased's intentions were sincere, but his policy leadership was flawed, so he has been criticized by the domestic people recently." Konoe's wife told a reporter from our agency that her husband met with his relatives and close friends on the last night before his death. His younger brother, Viscount Konoe, had just returned from the United States and also met with his brother that evening. His 22-year-old son talked with his father for a long time after the guests left, which was the last time he met Konoe.

[Agence France-Presse, Tokyo, 16th] According to well-informed sources in Japan, it was announced this afternoon that the reason for Konoe's suicide was to protect Emperor Hirohito. Because Konoe was to be tried for war crimes, he would be forced to reveal the internal secrets of Japan before Pearl Harbor, which would implicate the Emperor and expose his responsibility in this incident. Konoe's suicide by taking poison instead of seppuku was in accordance with the traditions of the Japanese aristocracy. It is said that if a Japanese aristocrat sheds blood in his residence, it will bring misfortune to the Emperor.

[United Press, Tokyo, 16th] Yesterday, the entrance to Sugamo Prison was crowded with people who wanted to see the war criminals surrendering. The news of Konoe's suicide came as a great shock. After hearing about Konoe's suicide, US officials immediately declared that he had the right to commit suicide. Three tall American soldiers, barefoot in accordance with Japanese custom, guarded the small road leading to Konoe's suicide room. Japanese photography studios were allowed to take pictures, and US official photographers had already finished taking pictures.

### Death Note: Deep Remorse for Treacherous Policies

[United Press, Tokyo, 16th] Before his suicide, Konoe wrote a death note in pencil. He handed it to his second son in his bedroom at around 1:00 AM this morning, and then went to bed at around 2:00 AM. He committed suicide by poison about three hours later. His suicide note stated: "Since the outbreak of the China Incident, I have often felt remorse for my improper handling of national affairs. However, if I were to be arrested and tried by the American court, such humiliation would be unbearable for me. I feel particularly responsible for the outcome of the China Incident. Therefore, I have made my best efforts to reach an understanding between the United States and Japan in order to resolve the China issue. I had hoped and tried to cooperate with the United States to solve the Pacific problem through peaceful means, but unexpectedly, I was listed as a war criminal, which is regrettable. My true intentions are understood by my friends, and there are not a few of these friends on the American side. Public opinion in this world is currently filled with excessive stimulation caused by the war, and it is inevitable that emotions will be used, and innocent people will be misunderstood, and malicious slander and unfounded rumors will be created. However, this kind of excitement will eventually subside, and the truth will be known."

### After Konoe's Suicide, Keenan Issues Statement: War Criminals Should Be Tried According to US Law; If Innocent, There is No Need to Feel Apprehensive; Emperor's Right-Hand Man, Kido, Imprisoned

[United Press, Tokyo, 16th] Following the suicide of former Prime Minister Konoe Fumimaro out of fear of punishment, Keenan, the American Chief Prosecutor for Japanese war crimes trials, issued a statement to the Japanese people today, saying that if the Japanese are innocent, they do not need to fear American trials. Konoe was ordered to report to Sugamo Prison, but then committed suicide by poison. In fact, anyone suspected of being a war criminal and detained can rest assured unless they know they are guilty and are condemned by their conscience. We have repeatedly stated that the judgment of anyone's guilt must be done through legal procedures. The United States is an advanced civilized country, and its judicial system is known for its perfection and fairness. Those who commit suicide out of fear of punishment must be psychologically unsound, or they do not understand the American judiciary or misjudge it. [United Press, Tokyo, 16th] Kido Koichi, the "maker of the Konoe cabinet" whom Emperor Hirohito relied on as his right-hand man, surrendered to Sugamo Prison today with his secretary and a representative of the liaison office. He brought a suitcase and two packages of luggage. Kido did not comment on Konoe's suicide.

[Our Newspaper, Tokyo, 16th] MacArthur's headquarters today issued an order to the Japanese government, ordering the Japanese side to hand over 69 suspected war criminals to Sugamo Prison for inspection within the shortest possible time. It is said that these 69 people had committed atrocities against Allied soldiers and civilians. According to Colonel Hardy, the American warden of Sugamo Prison, four war criminals had surrendered to the prison between 10:00 AM and 11:00 AM this morning. They were Admiral Udotakao, Count Sakai Tadahiro, Viscount Okouchi Masatoshi, and Rear Admiral Oda Shigeo.

### MacArthur Will Temporarily Suspend the Arrest of Japanese War Criminals

To Give Japan a Chance to Breathe

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 16th, Special Dispatch] Sources in authority report that MacArthur may soon re-examine the issue of Japanese war criminals. The purpose may be to temporarily suspend the arrest of high-ranking Japanese officials in political and economic circles. Since MacArthur ordered the arrest of war criminals two weeks ago, Japan's political and economic activities have almost come to a standstill. This afternoon, MacArthur again ordered the arrest of 69 Japanese who had violated international regulations while serving in prisoner-of-war camps during the war. Although Japan does not have an Allied military government, the current situation has made MacArthur's headquarters the de facto Allied government in Japan. It is believed that the temporary suspension of war criminal arrests will give Japan a chance to breathe so that the Japanese government and its political development can recover.

### MacArthur Orders Japan to Abolish National Religion System

[Reuters, Tokyo, 16th] MacArthur yesterday ordered the abolition of the national religious system that the military had forced the people to accept.

Inflation Continues to Increase

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 15th, Special Dispatch] Japan's inflation has not only not been curbed, but has also increased in the past month and the first two weeks of this month. The daily issuance of yen banknotes means that the total amount of Bank of Japan banknotes in circulation has reached 49,168.8 million yen. Banking officials said that before mid-December, the Bank of Japan will have 50 billion yen in banknotes in circulation. By the end of the year, another 6 billion yen of banknotes will be added to circulation. The cause of the vicious inflation is the decrease in bank deposits and the large increase in withdrawals. This situation is due to the lack of household budgets and the black market.

### United Nations Permanent Headquarters Decided to Be Located in the United States; Scope of Authority of the General Assembly Also Determined

[Reuters, London, 16th] The United Nations Preparatory Commission yesterday passed a resolution by a two-thirds majority vote to locate the headquarters of the United Nations in the United States. Regarding the scope of authority of the General Assembly and the Security Council, fierce debate arose during Friday's debate, and a decision was finally made by the Eighth Technical Subcommittee yesterday. The point of contention was whether the General Assembly has the right to discuss the Preparatory Committee's recommendations regarding the methods, procedures, and agenda of the Security Council, or whether the Preparatory Committee's recommendations should be directly decided by the Security Council. The Eighth Technical Subcommittee yesterday voted 2 to 5 (with 6 abstentions), resolving to adopt Canada's proposal, deciding to amend the original text regarding the preliminary provisional agenda of the first General Assembly.

Economic and Social Council May Be Established Next Spring

[Central News Agency, London, 15th] The United Nations Preparatory Commission, recognizing the absolute urgency of dealing with post-war economic, social, and related issues as soon as possible, has decided to establish the Economic and Social Council in January or February next year. The Preparatory Commission's Technical Subcommittee C has now completed its work on the organization of the Economic and Social Council. According to the plan, the Economic and Social Council will hold its first regular session within 15 days after the General Assembly elects the 18 council members in January. The chief representative of India to the Technical Subcommittee C has drafted his proposals (including the organizational plan for the major committees under the Economic and Social Council), which will be submitted to the General Assembly for approval. According to the plan drafted by the Technical Subcommittee C, the Economic and Social Council will establish five major committees during its first regular session to review all the details of the most pressing social and economic issues facing the world. The five major committees to be established by the Economic and Social Council during its first regular session will be: (1) Human Rights Committee, (2) Economic and Employment Committee, (3) Temporary Social Committee, (4) Statistics Committee, and (5) Narcotics Committee. In addition, it has approved a recommendation to establish three other committees at the second regular session of the Council, but this will depend on the situation at the first regular session. These three committees are: (1) Social Statistics Committee, (2) Temporary Transportation and Communications Committee, and (3) Accounting Committee. Each committee will be organized jointly by government representatives and technical experts.

[Reuters, London, 16th] Although the United Nations Preparatory Commission has decided on the location of the United Nations headquarters, and its Economic and Social Working Group and the International League of Nations Working Group have also completed their tasks, there are still various complex problems that have not been resolved, which is disappointing. The work of the subcommittee on the Security Council is more advanced, but the progress of the committee on other general issues has been slower than expected due to its adherence to the principle of handling simple events first, delaying progress by a week.

### US Military Commentator Eliot Discusses the Current New Crisis in Japan, Says the Japanese Authorities Have Neither Repented Nor Implemented Democracy

[Our Correspondent] According to a broadcast from San Francisco on the 15th: Major Eliot, a prominent American military commentator, wrote an article in the New York Times today, extensively discussing the current crisis in Japan and the Japanese government's delay in implementing democracy.

Eliot first stated: Before Japan's social problems are resolved, the parliament is merely wasting time. Japan has completely ignored the current social and economic crisis.

Currently, Japan has many fundamental issues, such as food, education, labor relations, democratic issues, private land ownership, financial difficulties, and the urgent need for a fair and humane political administration, all of which require immediate attention and resolution. However, the parliament only engages in empty talk and has no substantial discussions.

This situation is a typical response of Japan in a crisis. Recently, when the Japanese cabinet established a commission to investigate the causes of the defeat, it never mentioned the reasons why Japan went to war, the crimes of those responsible for causing the war, or the unforgivable lies spread by the military during the war. It only focused on why Japan was defeated, which is incomprehensible.

The true meaning of this attitude is actually to research how to strengthen the country in preparation for another war.

Eliot further stated: The Japanese cabinet has never expressed remorse for the crimes of the Japanese military that disgraced the country. Eight years ago, the Japanese army's rape and murder in Nanjing, even when recalled by the Japanese themselves, is filled with shame and horror. Eight years later, the Japanese authorities still have not brought these inhuman rapes to justice.

Although some Japanese leaders cunningly claim to have democratic ideas, militarism and totalitarianism have clearly not died in Japan. The generals, the samurai spirit, and the businessmen who launched the war are still walking around with their heads held high, feeling proud of themselves. For example, General Minami recently denied to a Yomiuri Shimbun reporter that the military or the zaibatsu were the real criminals in this war. Japan's collapse should be blamed on the general public.

He said, "Tojo did his best, but the people could not meet his expectations."

This kind of argument, that the people could not satisfy the Emperor's demands, has been repeatedly stated by Japanese officials and is laughable.

However, after the US military occupied Japan, it has resolutely removed the factors that hinder peace and justice. The power of militarists and ultranationalists in Japan's social, political, and economic life has also been destroyed. The once powerful Japanese military leaders are in prison awaiting trial for war crimes, and some have already been judged by law. Japan's industry, agriculture, and national life have been completely cleansed of feudal remnants. Those who were familiar with Japan before the war will surely find that this country has undergone astonishing changes. However, all these changes have been caused by external pressure, and not by the Japanese side alone. Many changes theoretically accepted by the Japanese authorities are resisted by reactionary elements. In short, there are countless Japanese who oppose reform, but they still consider themselves democrats.

It is time to take positive action. A truly democratic new constitution should be decided by the Japanese people. A definite, practical, and clear plan should be announced to address Japan's current social crisis. Indeed, all Japanese politicians, even including the Emperor himself, must immediately stop all empty promises and meaningless guarantees, and must establish concrete and substantial proposals.

Only then can Japan move forward on the path of progress. Only then will the world believe that the beautiful words of the Japanese are truly powerful. Only then can the Japanese convince the world that Japan is qualified to be a member of modern civilized nations.

Eliot concluded: We must not assume that the occupying authorities can be responsible for implementing permanent reforms. Japan, which failed by listening to the words of bad leaders, should follow the wise words of true patriots. However, what Japan needs is not only this, Japan also needs an immediate reform plan.

### US Troops Stationed in India and Burma Sequentially Return Home

[Central News Agency, New Delhi, 16th Dispatch] The US Military Headquarters in the India-Burma Theater announced this afternoon: Since September of this year, the total number of US troops who have departed from India to return to the United States is 133,680, of which 72,000 are from the India-Burma Theater, and more than 37,000 are from China, boarding ships in India to return to the US. However, after the end of November, there were very few US troops from the China Theater coming here to board ships. According to the current withdrawal rate, it is estimated that by February 1 next year, only 33,500 US troops will remain in the India-Burma Theater.

According to Gilchrist, he hopes that the people of Iceland can recognize the significant benefits of becoming a state of the United States. When a reporter asked Congressman Bloom, chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, whether the bill had a chance to be brought before Congress, Bloom replied, "I not only have no opinion on this, I don't even want to hear about it. It is difficult to imagine what is so ugly about this invitation. I have great respect for the people of Iceland. They have been honest and correct for a thousand years. We must let them be."

### Local Dispatches

Nantong

The Riverbank Collapses, Urging Rescue

This county is located on the west bank of the Yangtze River. Before the incident, great importance was always attached to bank protection projects. However, the enemy puppets have never paid attention to it in the past eight years, resulting in serious damage to the riverbank and a very dangerous situation. In particular, the area from Yaogang in the east to Dexing Township, about 10,080 zhang long, the foot of the embankment is washed away by huge waves, and it collapses day by day. Among them, the embankment of the eighth bao, about 150 zhang, has collapsed more than half. The water level has risen sharply, and the river water will immediately flood in. Nearby villagers are guarding it day and night. The township office submitted a report to the first district chief, who forwarded it to the county government, calling for rescue. After receiving the report, County Chief Yang, together with District Chief Zhang and construction personnel, inspected the area on the afternoon of the 7th of this month, and then invited township bao chiefs and local people to discuss the active development of rescue work.

Kunshan

In the 25th year of the Republic of China, the Central Water Conservancy Association allocated 300,000 yuan for construction. Kong Xiangxi personally attended the groundbreaking ceremony. After the war, no one managed it, and most of it was destroyed. The county government has recently appointed Huang Zichuan as the director of management and sent the recently organized water conservancy survey team to plan the reconstruction.

City Boxed Rice Establishes a Place for Public Sale

The local food industry has decided that during the military grain purchase period, in order to maintain the people's food supply, it will set up eight retail outlets from the 13th to sell rice at a flat price in the urban area, and stipulate that each person is limited to purchase five sheng, each sheng is 50 yuan, to limit consumption.

Wuxi

Coal Shortage is Severe, Requesting Relief

The Organizing Committee of the County Chamber of Commerce believes that the coal storage in Wuxi is insufficient, causing panic.

### China's Current Urgent Task: Establishing a Modern Transportation System

— Original Article by Brig. Gen. George Olmstead

Brig. Gen. George Olmstead has served as the Chief of Staff of the US Army G-5 in the China Theater since January of this year. He is a major advisor to General Wedemeyer, participating in discussions on all political, economic, and crucial issues related to the US military in China. He is highly respected for his understanding of China. This article's content is insightful, and it is specially translated by this newspaper's editorial department for our readers. — Editor

American army personnel who have served in the mountainous and vast western China all unanimously agree that there are significant differences in outlook on life and lifestyles across various regions of China. For example, Yunnanese people differ greatly in clothing and living habits from Sichuanese, Hunanese, or Guizhou people. Even within a single province, there are significant variations.

To a casual observer, these differences in customs and languages, clothing, and manners might seem like the enchanting aspects of the East, but soon, he would realize that the causes of these cultural differences are signs of a serious underlying malady that must be quickly corrected if China is to realize its inherent national potential.

Economic Efforts Must Consider National Interests

A serious symptom is that one region cannot sell its surplus products to satisfy the needs of another. It's possible that famine is prevalent in one province while neighboring provinces have a surplus of food.

If we disregard the misery caused by isolation, it might seem best to let things take their natural course. Everyone knows that opening up highways, railways, and airlines to these remote areas would not yield immediate benefits because the region is too vast and the terrain too difficult. The vast majority of the local people live at the lowest level of subsistence, using only the most rudimentary tools to compete for survival.

However, from the perspective of the Chinese nation, it must clearly embark on a new era of economic, social, and political development. Agriculture is the sole means of livelihood for the vast majority of Chinese people, so it must be improved and developed. To achieve this goal, coastal commercial cities and manufacturing centers are extremely important. However, economic efforts in the coastal areas must aim at the benefit of the entire country.

Chinese Farmers Are Unable to Access Markets

I (the author) am from Iowa, a state that is also primarily engaged in agricultural production, so I am very interested in the various problems faced by Chinese farmers. In Iowa, transportation has developed to a degree that allows agriculture to be conducted on a scale similar to that of industry. Farmers can transport their crops to the market and sell them throughout the country and abroad. They receive cash, which they can use to buy manufactured goods, thereby increasing their comfort, productivity, and earning potential, while also reducing their labor. The cash income of American farmers, per capita, may not be as high as that of people in urban areas, but their standard of living and educational opportunities are probably better than those of farmers anywhere else in the world, and compared to Chinese farmers, the difference in all aspects is too great.

In my opinion, the reason for this difference in economic and social status is that Chinese farmers cannot access markets to sell their goods or purchase other commodities. The isolation that exists within China today prevents the attainment of a normal balance between the industrial and agricultural economies. Manufacturers on the coast find that their market is very narrow due to the lack of adequate transportation, while farmers not only cannot sell their produce at a fair price but also cannot obtain modern tools and equipment from manufacturers to enjoy the benefits of civilization.

The Fundamental Solution Requires a Modern Transportation System

Previously, like most Americans, I thought that China's most pressing need was an improved school system so that all people in the country could share the benefits of education. Now I know that this is only part of the problem. This is not to say that education is not valuable, but rather that it cannot be effective until it can penetrate isolated areas. Before transportation is improved, books and even teachers cannot reach students. At the same time, education is not very meaningful when production areas cannot access the market.

The conclusion seems very clear: the best way to solve China's economic and social ills is to establish a modern transportation system. However, several factors hinder its development. One of the main ones is extremely strong conservatism. In China, as in other countries, many people always like to maintain the status quo and are unwilling to improve. The main danger of this idea is that it often tends to develop into a habit. Although China still faces the threat of civil war and the various complex problems after the end of the war against Japan, for the sake of the country's future, it must prevent this conservatism from hindering progress.

Floods and Famines Are Not Inevitable

Another opposing view that I often hear people say is that floods, famines, poverty, and disease prevalent in China are considered necessary calamities, believing that without them, China would be overpopulated. This is not a new theory, but rather the doctrine of the 19th-century economist Malthus. In Europe, this doctrine is now only reserved for academic discussion. Due to the rapid advances in the work of physicians, engineers, and scientists, Western leaders and ordinary people have made their countries better places to live and work, and new horizons of life are repeatedly unfolding before them. This is not to say that everything has reached an ideal state; we still have to overcome war, racial persecution, outdated ideas, and disease. Although we still have several shortcomings, especially war, which seems to become more serious with progress, on the whole, the people of Europe and America can accept the gifts of modern civilization and enable everyone to enjoy more things than ever before in the world.

Developing China Should Start with the Big Picture

A third and even greater obstacle is that Chinese and foreign industrial and commercial leaders have failed to lead China to develop its position in the modern world. Restoring and developing China's transportation is not solely the responsibility of the government; highways, airlines, railways, telephones, radio, and domestic trade transportation issues must mostly be funded and operated by private individuals. Their private interests cannot be ignored, but they must focus on China's long-term future. If China does not have this kind of leadership, it is difficult to expect to occupy an important position in the ranks of modern nations. At the same time, if it develops its national strength in this area, then its industry and finance will be unable to surpass the pre-war position.

During the war, the United States' expenditure on highways and airfields, coupled with the plans planned by the Chinese government due to military needs, had opened up certain areas of China that previously relied only on primitive means of transportation. However, this contribution is only the beginning. There are very few highways in western China that have a road surface and can support the continuous traffic of large numbers of vehicles. Railways cannot fully exert their function as a transportation medium unless the current tracks and vehicles are substantially improved. Airplanes and radios, which are considered to solve all of China's transportation problems, also have limited functions.

Shanghai's Civilization Must Be Brought to the West

Shanghai and other coastal cities can be regarded as gateways to the outside world, centers for technological knowledge, credit loans, and enterprises. Only in such places can conceptual plans become reality. However, the civilization of the coastal areas, in the Western sense, is modern and must assume its own mission to bring the lessons learned from progress to the west. This does not mean that China's only solution is to impose the civilization of industrial technology on the ancient lifestyles of the agricultural provinces. In fact, these two cultures are bound to merge, and modern China will emerge with a distinctly Chinese character and philosophy.

Shanghai, like New York, is an international city, but it would be unfortunate if this international nature led it to mistakenly believe that it is not connected to other parts of China and has an independent meaning. This is inevitable to some extent; New York is also known for its remoteness from the problems of other parts of the country, but New York's financial and industrial technology has played an important role in the economic development of the United States. Shanghai occupies a similar position and has the same responsibility. If Shanghai's cultural life is international, then its economic life should be strictly national because Shanghai's happiness is inseparable from the happiness of the entire country.

Today's China Has a Great Future

It is very clear that China faces many problems that must be solved before it can make much progress. The current state of the national economy, the excessive inflation, the rising cost of living, the lack of consumption, the threat of civil war, and the chaotic political situation all urgently need to be resolved as soon as possible. However, despite these problems, China today is standing on a road with unlimited potential, and it is unprecedented in history.

For foreigners in China, the future is good. The Chinese government recognizes the value of foreign capital and specialized technology in developing a new China. The new China needs these things, but it must accept foreign capital and specialized technology like other countries, without special concessions or extraterritorial rights. This fact is commendable. If foreigners or foreign companies have goods to sell or services to offer that China needs, their citizens will certainly be welcomed. In my opinion, it seems that the opportunities for capital investment and individual enterprise can only be limited by the desire of capitalists to invest and the productive capacity of individuals. These are the two basic conditions of a free economy. Apart from this, we cannot expect China to go further.

America's confidence in China is the same as our confidence in developing the American West after the Civil War, and it is also the confidence that prompted the United States to support China in this war. I believe that this confidence will not diminish or lose its great significance in peacetime.

### The League of Nations in China: A Glimpse of the Jialing Guesthouse in Chongqing – Reported by Reuters Correspondent Campbell

The brown three-story Jialing Guesthouse, located on a tree-covered slope overlooking the Jialing River, can only rank third in comfort compared to grand hotels such as the Waldorf in New York and the Dorchester in London, but its position in international diplomacy is as high as the latter, because the envoys of many countries are squeezed into its two suites and twenty-six bedrooms. Although only fitted with paper windows, bamboo ceilings, and straw mats, it has been used as the headquarters of foreign embassies and diplomatic missions for five years, such as Brazil, Argentina, Mexico, Sweden, Poland, Norway, Iran, Portugal, and Belgium.

Travel magazines and travel guides call this place the "Magnificent Palace," the most modern and luxurious hotel in Chongqing.

The Jialing Guesthouse was built less than a year ago at a cost of 250,000 yuan to accommodate the constant stream of foreign guests passing through this wartime capital. "Adaptability" and "convenience" are not ideal. The thin walls allow Latin American and European countries to spy on each other's foreign policies or exchange sweet words.

The only disputes here arise from "antiques." The Brazilian ambassador attempted to open a museum in the embassy, ​​and he moved all kinds of bottles, Buddha statues, Tibetan ornaments, jade, prayer beads, prayer mats, etc., into his embassy, ​​which only had one bedroom, one living room, and one bathroom.

The staff in the hall often wandered into his suite to discuss the value of the nine hundred antiques in detail.

The Mexican ambassador lived in another large suite in the hotel; other ambassadors, counselors, secretaries, attachés, and other figures were squeezed into rooms that combined bedrooms and offices. The newly appointed Argentine ambassador had to make do in the small dining room downstairs!

The large number of rats and bedbugs in Chongqing were indeed annoying, but diplomats dealt with them in the same way as everyone else.

The Jialing Guesthouse was one of the happiest places in the capital. Every national holiday, every birthday or death anniversary of a national hero, could become an excuse for holding a "party." At that time, ambassadors would play the piano, play the guitar, tell fortunes, perform sugar-to-paper tricks, and they had no diplomatic restraint at all!

A dinner here is really a gathering of people from all over the world! The products in the kitchen are purely British, and diplomats can choose whether they like it or not.

Diplomats shuttled into the kitchen, hoping to cook a pure home-style dish.

The Jialing Guesthouse is run by a man surnamed Xu, who used to be a safe manufacturer in Shanghai. He knows the secrets of running a hotel: "The farther away you are, the better!"

### Konoe Fumimaro Dug His Own Grave

Konoe Fumimaro, the "fair-faced prime minister" of Japan and the instigator of the war of aggression against China, finally committed suicide out of fear of punishment the night before last! The transmission of this message makes me feel both surprised and unsurprised. What is surprising is that, judging from his suicide note, on the one hand, he wanted to admit that he was responsible for this eight-year bloody war of aggression against China, but on the other hand, he tried to evade everything, (which shows that he did not wake up until his death and was still a thorough aggressor who was irresponsible. Konoe dug his own grave, and the history of the past eight years has provided iron-like evidence. The launch of the war of aggression against China was the first step in his project of digging his own grave, and Japan's surrender was the completion of the grave he dug. According to this statement, the scene of suicide out of fear of punishment is Konoe's last coffin nail. Now, after the coffin is closed, Konoe is the main war criminal who invaded China, but how can "one coffin cover his body" make "everything is over"?

The people of China and even the people of the world who love justice and peace have the right to demand that he be tried and severely punished, just as we have had the "whipping the corpse three hundred times" in our history. Because he killed himself out of fear of punishment, and at the same time, he killed tens of thousands of Chinese people for the sake of promoting the war of aggression against China, and even killed many Japanese people who did not want to fight. How can we let such a creator of disaster "end it all"?

Konoe was in power for a total of fifty-six years from his debut to his fall. He was born in 1891 and lost his father at the age of fourteen. He was raised by his father's friend Saionji, and later entered the Faculty of Law of the Imperial University of Tokyo. After three years, he followed Saionji to Paris to attend the peace conference. Having been influenced by what he saw and heard for a long time, he had already acquired Saionji's mantle. Since then, he has entered the Japanese "senior statesman" class and has been invited to join the cabinet several times, but he has always refused. After the February 26 Incident, Saionji recommended him to form a cabinet, but he was still able to "decline the great order," but at that time he organized associations such as the Toyo Association and the Nanyo Association, calling himself the "chairman." This period can be said to be the preparatory period for Konoe's war crimes of aggression against China. With the resignation of Hayashi Senjuro, Konoe's official career was satisfied under the conditions of reversing the so-called "Japanese crisis." As soon as he took office, he launched the "North China Incident," followed by the continuous entry of the Kwantung Army into the customs. He mobilized three divisions from Japan and dispatched more than 100 aircraft to attack Pingjin. On the one hand, he said that he would "not change the expansion policy," but on the other hand, he sent Japanese aircraft to fly all over our national airspace. In the process of developing the "Konoe Three Principles" and the "unchanging and non-expanding policy," the serious losses suffered by our country's civilians and soldiers are really uncountable. This period can be said to be the budding period of Konoe's aggression against China.

Under the leadership of the wise and heroic Generalissimo Chiang, our authorities began to break Konoe's conspiracy to invade China, so Konoe had to change his tactics and put forward the so-called "Greater East Asia New Order" and "long-term war." This drama—the so-called "Konoe Statement"—was once again attacked by our authorities and was completely discredited. Konoe was so scared that he fled with his head in his hands and ended up resigning. This was the launch period of Konoe's aggression against China.

But Konoe was unwilling to step down. He saw that in June of the 29th year of the Republic of China, Germany had won in Europe, and Denmark, Norway, the Netherlands, Belgium, and France had all fallen into German hands. He believed that this was a good opportunity for him to make a comeback, so he speculated again and came out to form a cabinet. The so-called "Japan-Germany-Italy Tripartite Military Alliance" was the "greatest masterpiece" at that time. After the outbreak of the Soviet-German War, Matsuoka was dismissed, and Konoe's cabinet was reorganized for the second time, and the arrogance of the warlords became even more uncontrollable. After Hiranuma was assassinated, Konoe's third cabinet collapsed. In total, he formed cabinets three times from his debut to his resignation, always using the excuse of "doing his best to resolve the war" to secretly practice the reality of his false pretexts, so he made trouble again and again.

Japan formed the prelude to the war of aggression against China with Konoe's first cabinet, fell into international isolation with Konoe's second cabinet, and created the Pacific War with Konoe's third cabinet and Tojo's rise to power. A string of war crimes should be severely punished by the United Nations, and can never be ended by suicide. (Ya Nong)

……Konoe, whose crimes deserve death

### Tokyo Street Stalls

The crimes of Japanese warlords are too numerous to mention. The United Nations used atomic bombs to inform them in order to save the Japanese people from suffering, and the dawn of peace began to appear. After Tokyo was bombed, Japanese civilians had nowhere to live and no ability to make a living. Street life was everywhere. The picture shows Tokyo merchants setting up street stalls on the sidewalk, and customers inspecting food on the ground.

### Editorial: Konoe's Suicide is Too Light a Punishment!

—The Japanese People Should Redeem Their Past Sins—

A Tokyo dispatch yesterday reported that Konoe Fumimaro, the instigator of the invasion of China, committed suicide on the evening of the 15th out of fear of punishment. Konoe, a young nobleman, became prime minister with the title of "White-faced Prime Minister," considering himself extraordinary, and the Japanese people once placed considerable hope in him. However, during his three times forming a cabinet over eight years, he not only ignited the flames of a full-scale invasion of China but also initiated and directed the behind-the-scenes launching of the Pacific War. The unprecedented devastation suffered by humanity during World War II can be said to be a gift from Konoe. MacArthur naturally designated him as a war criminal and ordered his arrest. After Japan's surrender, Konoe also publicly stated that he should bear full responsibility for the war of aggression against China. Knowing that he could hardly escape punishment on the day he surrendered, he ended his life in despair. As the saying goes, "He who does much evil is sure to come to ruin." And, "You reap what you sow." Konoe's current situation is entirely the result of his own evil deeds; his suicide is entirely the result of his numerous acts of injustice, which are not worth discussing in detail. However, from the perspective of Japan and China, Konoe's suicide is still too light a punishment, and this remaining guilt must be redeemed by the efforts of the Japanese people.

It is not easy for a nation to rise and prosper; it is even more difficult for a country to build itself up. Japan, originally an island nation in the East, has for thousands of years been nurtured and protected by Chinese culture. Once it underwent reforms and innovations, striving for progress, it managed to join the ranks of powerful nations after fifty years of planning and management since the Meiji Restoration. The First World War gave it ample opportunities for development, and the situation in East Asia almost revolved around Japan's lead. Unfortunately, Japan at that time only paid lip service to benevolence, while in reality practicing hegemony, single-mindedly aiming to dominate Asia and unify the world.

When the Father of the Nation Sun Yat-sen passed through Japan on his way north in 1925, he earnestly advised them repeatedly, but his words fell on deaf ears. It was not surprising that the warlords of the army and navy, and the young and reckless military men, went on a rampage. But why were there no insightful people among the elder statesmen, senior ministers, and aristocratic strategists who could turn the tide and protect the country's fate?

Since the February 26th Incident in Japan, when Prime Minister Okada was attacked by thugs, creating another political tragedy after the May 15th Incident, the arrogance of the military increased daily. Hirota Koki could not control them, and Hayashi Senjuro could do nothing. Konoe, who at the time had the hopes of the times on his shoulders and was also valued by Prince Saionji, was expected by all parties to serve as a bridge between the military and the political parties, thinking that Konoe could perhaps slightly restrain the madness of the warlords, much like the saying, "If this man does not come forth, what will become of the country?" If Konoe felt that he could not save the situation, why bother to seek trouble? But since he resolutely formed a cabinet, he should have understood how Japan should maintain its prosperity, how to be friendly and benevolent to its neighbors, and how to "untie the bell that tied it," returning the four northeastern provinces to China, repairing land relations, and opening the door to peace in East Asia. Instead, he did not pursue this path. Only a month after forming his cabinet, he launched the Lugouqiao Incident, unveiling the prelude to a full-scale invasion of China. From then on, Japan became more and more deeply mired in the war of aggression against China, unable to extricate itself, and even strengthened the war system, serving as a precursor to Tojo Hideki's launching of the Pacific War. Finally, the flames of war spread, the people were plunged into misery, and Japan had to surrender to the Allied forces. We think: a Japan that had been nurtured by Chinese culture for thousands of years, had diligently emulated Europe and America for decades, and had gradually become wealthy and powerful, dominating one side, in less than eight years, the achievements of the Meiji era were all washed away. How difficult success is, and how easy destruction is! Konoe had the opportunity to be effective and was in a position to be effective. Because he was intent on being perfunctory, pleasing everyone, pandering to the warlords, and instigating aggression, he brought about the disastrous consequences of destroying the country. Judging Konoe from Japan's perspective, with the coffin lid nailed down, isn't his suicide too light a punishment?

Furthermore, from China's perspective: after Konoe came to power, on the one hand, he used sweet words and honeyed phrases, hoping for "Sino-Japanese cooperation," and on the other hand, he used gunfire and bullets to massacre the Chinese people. Leaving aside everything else, just reading the description of the Nanjing Massacre eight years ago, written by our newspaper's special correspondent yesterday, the hellish life of rape and slaughter suffered by hundreds of thousands of men, women, old, and young, we will never forget Konoe's crime of initiating aggression, and we believe that the people of the world will never forgive the atrocities of the Japanese invaders. Matsui Iwane seemed to have said when he returned from China that he would shave his head and become a monk to show repentance. Can such a sin be settled with just one act of repentance?

Originally, China and Japan were countries with the same culture, and for thousands of years, when China was powerful, Japan did not perish. In the past hundred years, with the exchange of goods between China and foreign countries, and the emphasis on good faith and harmony, as long as Japan did not intensify its aggression, forcing China to become unable to survive, then even the shame of defeat in the Sino-Japanese War of 1894-1895 and the humiliation of the Treaty of Shimonoseki could be improved through equal means, and economic cooperation, equality, and mutual benefit would be easier to achieve, given the contiguity of Chinese and Japanese territories. However, during Konoe's three terms as prime minister, Japan insisted on not taking this path, insisting on not admitting its mistakes, insisting on going all the way to the end, insisting on colluding with a few traitors and scoundrels, and taking the 400 million Chinese people as enemies, resulting in millions of bandit troops, like beasts, running wild everywhere in China, committing atrocities, murder, and robbery, creating a psychology among the Chinese people of hating the Japanese invaders to the bone. Although our National Government treats Japan with leniency, from the perspective of the people, the people who suffered the massacre and robbery of the Japanese invaders will never forget. The Japanese soldiers who can still ride horses on the streets today are the mad beasts who came to China to carry out the massacre under the orders of Konoe and his successors! As long as we see these beasts appearing on Chinese territory, we will never forget Konoe's crimes. In order to consolidate world peace and to ensure that an aggressive Japan does not reappear in the East, China must insist on severely punishing all war criminals, large and small, especially the war criminals who invaded China, and must destroy Japan's military regime so that the Japanese people can truly be cultivated in "human nature" through the re-education of loving peace and freedom. Reflecting on these efforts that we should make in the future, Konoe's debt to China is indeed too great even in death.

Looking further: Konoe's crimes are not only the result of his own evil deeds, but also the result of the Japanese people's own evil deeds; not only Konoe's numerous acts of injustice, but also the Japanese people's numerous acts of injustice. Only with such Japanese people could there be such a Japanese political system; only with such a Japanese political system could such Japanese political figures be produced. Therefore, Konoe's launching of the invasion of China and preparing for the world war can be seen as a representative of the mad behavior of the Japanese people. Perhaps we can severely condemn the Japanese warlords and forgive the Japanese people, thinking that the Japanese people were under the tyranny of the warlords and could do nothing. But why did the warlords emerge, why did they seize political power, why did they make Konoe unable to bow down and lower his head to breathe in the warlords' nostrils? We still cannot help but blame the Japanese people in the spirit of "Chunqiu demands perfection from the virtuous." Therefore, the Japanese people should know that from now on, they should do their best to be peaceful and kind people in order to redeem their past crimes of being tyrannical and domineering. As the saying goes, "Seek your own blessings." Considering Konoe's suicide, the Japanese people should not pity Konoe at all, nor should they forgive Konoe, nor should they think that Konoe's suicide was due to the coercion of the United Nations and complain about the United Nations. On the contrary, they should deeply realize that Konoe has failed Japan, failed China, and failed the world. Even death is not enough to cover his guilt, and the Japanese people should strive to correct their past mistakes, so as to redeem themselves in the future and seek their own future blessings.

### The Face of a Beast: A Casual Talk About Konoe

Konoe Fumimaro's name contains the character "文" (Wen, meaning culture), but considering his entire history of invading China, he has indeed failed the "文" (culture). In other words, he was too "武" (Wu, meaning martial).

He usually loved to read literary works, attempting to use this as a mask to conceal his aggressive actions. However, the fox's tail was exposed; he favored low-brow literature, literature describing the lives of young men and women, literature of the type of Kikuchi Kan.

Konoe once pretended to be a journalist because, as a member of Saionji's entourage, he was not allowed to attend the Paris Peace Conference, so he fraudulently claimed to be a journalist to participate in it, and was later reprimanded by Saionji.

Once, at the wedding of Konoe's niece, a masquerade ball was held, and Konoe personally went to Asakusa to buy a fake beard and dressed up as Hitler's ghost to appear at the ball. They both ended up committing suicide, and some commentators said that this was "not without reason" and "not a coincidence."

Western newspapers jokingly called Konoe's repeated cabinet formations simply changing a "hat."

Now, Konoe has committed suicide out of fear of punishment. We feel that if he had changed his "brain" earlier, he might not have resorted to this "suicide" tactic! (Mu Sheng)

Commercial News

### Financial and Commercial Review of Last Week

Finance: Last week, the daily interbank lending rate in Shanghai's financial market remained stable at 30 cents per thousand yuan. The secret lending rate in the Securities Building decreased from 12 cents to 8 cents due to limited demand for household expenses. This was even cheaper than the bank overdraft interest rate of 9 cents per month. Everyone was nervously watching the Supreme Economic Conference for direction regarding the new exchange rate with the US dollar. Initially, there were rumors that the US dollar could be pegged at 950 yuan to one, based on the fact that the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) was selling each 44-catty bag of US flour for 1,900 yuan in legal tender, and that the raw material, wheat, was priced at US$1.805 per bushel in the Chicago market. This was consistent with the government's policy of applying low exchange rates to daily necessities. Gold sellers were plentiful. On Tuesday, the price suddenly dropped to a new low of 583,000 yuan. Later, however, due to the fact that Standard-Vacuum and two other oil companies were selling gasoline for 400 yuan per gallon, while its cost was US$0.25, it was estimated that the US dollar should be pegged at 1,600 yuan. This was consistent with the government's policy of applying high exchange rates to luxury goods. The gold market's buying interest suddenly rose. On Friday, it peaked at 768,000 yuan, a sharp increase of 185,000 yuan compared to the low point. Finally, due to powerful entities selling gold and buying US dollars, it fell back to 730,000 yuan at closing, still up 47,000 yuan compared to the end of the previous week. The US dollar slightly followed the gold price, falling to 935 yuan. Gradually, because Chongqing was looking at a rate of 1,350 yuan for the US dollar, buyers were enthusiastic, and the peak reached 1,325 yuan. Afterwards, those with abundant funds and import-export businesses seized the opportunity to buy on dips, stabilizing at 1,220 yuan at closing, up 130 yuan, or more than 12%, compared to the previous week. There was demand for Hong Kong dollars and Cantonese currency, with old currency up 15 yuan and new currency up 4-5 yuan. There were sellers of silver, and silver shops were sluggish, with the price falling by 50 yuan per tael. Silver coins also fell slightly by 5 yuan per piece.

Securities: Since Chairman Chiang Kai-shek flew to Peiping, the political situation in North China has gradually become clearer. Banks and North China investors bought large quantities of unified bonds, especially Class C bonds. Sellers often could not deliver on the same day, and there were instances of being squeezed. It is reported that the total amount of unified public bonds issued in February 1936 was 146 million yuan, of which the actual amount of Class C bonds issued was 34,825,000 yuan. After deducting previous repayments, the remaining value is only worth about 500 bars of standard gold ten tael bars. In addition, the amount of bank holdings and wealthy investor locked holdings, the amount circulating on the market is limited. Every time there was a short squeeze, it would trigger a suspension of settlement. Last week, it closed at a peak of 600 yuan, up 60 yuan compared to the previous week. Among the Chinese stocks, due to the high gold price, large investors bought popular stocks, rising by 10-20 yuan. Due to the suspension of transfer of ownership of minor popular stocks, buyers were sparse, and they fell by 1-2 yuan. Foreign stocks were weak and fluctuated, with Jardine Matheson and Wheelock falling by 30-40 yuan each.

Commodities: Regarding commodities, the price of rice fell by 250-500 yuan compared to the previous week for both japonica and indica rice, due to the influx of Shanghai flour. Charitable organizations and hospitals have mostly switched to consuming rationed American flour, and local consumers are less interested in buying rice. Glutinous rice alone rose by 500 yuan. Due to UNRRA's first batch of American flour being sold for only 40 yuan per catty, or 1,760 yuan per bag, the Chinese flour industry was greatly suppressed, and sales were concentrated on American flour. The price of the top two grades of local flour continued to fall by 300-400 yuan. Currently, the flour mills are full of American wheat, and there is a trend towards even cheaper prices in the future. Among the miscellaneous grains, soybeans and corn sold averagely, falling by 200 yuan. Peanuts, needed by local confectioners, alone rose by 750 yuan, with large-grained Yangzhou goods being the most expensive at 11,750 yuan, and Bengbu goods being the cheapest at 8,500 yuan. Edible oil was affected by the frequent drops in soybean raw material prices. In addition, with the continuous arrival of goods from Qingdao, both raw oil and soybean oil fell by 2-3,000 yuan compared to the previous week. Due to the arrival of more than 1,000 dan of Taiwanese sugar in Shanghai, which is seeking a good price to sell, retail sales in the market were scattered. Xinghua red and white sugar each fell by 7,000 yuan, stabilizing at 40,000 yuan per 100 catties. Regarding textiles, raw cotton rose by 2,500 yuan due to the sales of coarse yarn and the manufacturers' purchase of "fire machine" cotton. The price of Nantong fine cotton remained stable at 40,000 yuan per load. Cotton yarn was needed in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River, and local merchants and farmers in the suburbs purchased coarse yarn of 16 counts or less, with each bale rising by 30-50,000 yuan. Cotton cloth slightly followed the yarn market and the gold price, rising by 2,000 yuan. Twelve-pound white plain cloth alone rose by 4,500 yuan. Due to news of a resolution of the labor unrest at silk factories, the demand for silk increased. In addition, the first batch of exports has already been shipped, and sentiment has improved. High-grade factory silk rose by 10,000 yuan per load, while Huzhou silk alone rose by 35,000 yuan. Rayon also rose by 70,000 yuan, and silk fabrics and crepe also rose by 500-1,000 yuan each. As the foreign firms started to sell, and Suzhou and Wuxi both had purchases, tea rose by 2-4,000 yuan for both red and green tea. Regarding fuel, with the continuous arrival of domestic and foreign goods, the price of Standard-Vacuum Asia Petroleum's kerosene fell from 130 yuan to 100 yuan per catty. Small families have a tendency to switch to using kerosene stoves. Firewood fell sharply, with a large amount piled up along the Suzhou River. Pine firewood has fallen to 850 yuan per load, a sharp drop of 450 yuan compared to the previous week. The price of other white coal, small coal, lump coal, and coal dust also fell by 2-30,000 yuan per ton. Among daily necessities, soap was affected by the sharp drop in soda ash from 700,000 yuan in late November to 140,000 yuan this week. Stockpilers were eager to sell, and prices fell by 1-2 yuan each. Matches were stable. Due to large-scale purchases by Sichuan merchants, British brand cigarettes were the most popular, with each carton soaring by 165,000 yuan. Chinese cigarettes are also expected to be stable. The future trend of all commodities tends to be concentrated on the fluctuation of the US dollar. (Chong Bo)

### Miscellaneous Grains of Bengbu

[Special Dispatch from This Newspaper] Before Bengbu flourished, the distribution center for miscellaneous grains in northern Anhui was Huaiyuan. In the early years of the Republic, when Ni Sichong was the military governor of Anhui, he spared no effort in revitalizing the Bengbu market. He invested in the construction of ship locks to facilitate navigation. Grain ships from the upper reaches of the Huai River could directly reach Bengbu, and the grain market of Huaiyuan was transferred to Bengbu. Thus, Bengbu became a distribution center for miscellaneous grains in northern Anhui, with a history of only over twenty years.

Production Areas of Miscellaneous Grains: Various places along the upper and lower reaches of the Huai River are known for producing miscellaneous grains, especially Yingzhou, Haozhou, Guoyang, Mengcheng, Zhengyangguan, and Wuhe. The main miscellaneous grains produced are soybeans and wheat, followed by sorghum, mung beans, sesame, peanuts, barley, and adzuki bean cakes. The peak sales period for soybeans is October, and for wheat, it is June. Between June and October each year, merchants gather in Bengbu. The major purchasing merchants are from Shanghai, Wuxi, and Changzhou. Before the incident (likely referring to the Sino-Japanese War), Bengbu sold 6 million dan of soybeans and 8 million dan of wheat annually. During the period of enemy occupation, strict controls were imposed on miscellaneous grains, especially soybeans. Export was strictly prohibited without permission from the enemy military, so there are no accurate estimates of soybean and wheat production and sales during this period.

Grain Firm Organization: Before the incident, there were 54 grain firms in Bengbu. After the victory of the War of Resistance, commerce in the recovered areas flourished. Currently, there are over 100 grain firms in Bengbu. These grain firms also operate salt businesses. Northern Anhui's salt also uses Bengbu as a distribution center. The salt supply along the Huai River relies on Bengbu. When grain ships arrive, they load salt for the return trip after selling miscellaneous grains. Before the incident, Bengbu grain ships sold around 5,000 dan of salt each time. The characteristics of the grain firms here are: first, they also sell salt; second, they are divided into selling firms and buying firms. Selling firms are smaller in scale and only help grain ship owners sell their goods, charging commissions. Buying firms are larger in scale because they sometimes have to advance funds for customers. Larger and more developed grain firms include Rendai, Banzhong, Yuanfu, Changfeng, Yuanlong, and Xicheng. There is also a grain industry association among the firms.

Miscellaneous Grain Transportation and Sales: About a mile from Bengbu is a gathering place for grain ships called Xin Chuantang (New Ship Pond), which was created by former Anhui Governor Ni Sichong. On average, over 2,000 grain ships are moored there daily, with masts standing like a forest, bow to stern. Before Xin Chuantang was opened, grain ships could not directly dock at Bengbu Wharf. Since the opening of Xin Chuantang, it has been convenient for grain ships. The miscellaneous grains produced along the Huai River are loaded onto ships and transported to Bengbu. Some customers entrust ship owners to transport their goods, while others are purchased and transported by the ship owners themselves. After arriving at Xin Chuantang, the ship owners send samples directly to the selling firms. Selling and buying firms hire small boats in Xin Chuantang, each flying the flag of their respective firms. Every morning, the customers go to the boats of the firms they usually deal with. These firms are the buying firms. On the buying firm's boat, there are sample officers of the firm waiting. On the selling firm's boat, there are officers of the firm, who specially accompany the grain ship owners and the samples loaded on their ships to the buying firm's boats for sales. If the prices negotiated by both parties are close, the selling firm trusts the buying firm's customers to go to the grain ship to check the samples. After the samples are verified, the deal is finalized. At the time of finalizing the deal, no deposit is paid, relying entirely on the credibility of the buying firm. Sampling, inspection, and transactions all take place on the boats, which can be called "water transactions." Every morning, small boats shuttle back and forth, flags flutter, a bustling scene, truly a unique aspect of the market. Buying firms charge a guarantee deposit of two percent when buying goods for customers.

Measurement Organization: Another characteristic of Bengbu's grain trade is the measurement organization. The miscellaneous grains are packed in seven-dou (a unit of dry measure) bags in Bengbu. In terms of soybeans, seven dou here is equivalent to about 220 Shanghai market catties. The sale and purchase of miscellaneous grains in water transactions are all handled by the measurement organization. After the measurement procedures are completed, the measurement organization charges a certain fee, about a dozen yuan per bag currently. Therefore, Bengbu's grain trade involves not only selling and buying firms but also a measurement organization, which acts as a witness to the weighing. Furthermore, Bengbu's soybean sales are mainly for export, while wheat has a large market in the city. Bengbu has two major flour mills, Baodian and Xinfeng. Before the incident, Shixing Mill needed 1,100 bags of wheat every day, and Xinfeng, which was smaller in scale, needed about 600 bags a day. (Shan)

### The Voice of Students Across the City - Appealing to Commissioners Ye and Niu

[City News] Yesterday morning at 9:30 AM, the Shanghai Student Federation held a meeting of representatives from universities and middle schools across the city at Yucai Middle School on Shanhai Pass Road. Present were Central Commissioners Ye Chucang and Niu Yongjian, as well as over 80 representatives from Fudan University, St. John's University, Soochow University, Tongde Medical College, Furen Middle School, St. Francis Middle School, and other institutions. After the meeting began, Ye and Niu delivered speeches. Ye said, in essence: "Seeing you student representatives reminds me of the May Fourth Movement 25 years ago. At that time, Shanghai's base camp was Fudan University, and the command center was the Republican Daily. I experienced it firsthand. Recalling it now feels like returning to childhood.

Students as the Center

I have always believed that the cultural world is centered on education, and education is centered on students. The Shanghai student community should be centered on you. Therefore, I hope you will take responsibility for leading students across the city to jointly study knowledge and assist the government." Ye also mentioned the Kunming student unrest, saying, "The Kunming student unrest has subsided and classes have resumed as usual. If Shanghai still echoes the Kunming student unrest, it is a truly unwise action. I hope Shanghai will no longer engage in such passive and destructive work in the future. Today's government is not the government of the May Fourth era; today's government is a government of national salvation and revolution." Niu explained the importance of China's position from a historical and geographical perspective.

Shouldering China's Mission

He encouraged the students to shoulder China's mission and the world's mission. After Ye and Niu finished speaking, representatives from various schools eagerly spoke, summarizing their opinions as follows: (1) The association expressed its infinite concern for the Kunming student unrest, especially for the students who died, expressing infinite sympathy. It was decided to apply to the central government for punishment of the main culprits, investigate the truth of the incident, provide compensation to the families of the students who died, and send a telegram to the Southwest Associated University to express condolences to the families of the students who died. (2) The Shanghai student community is very concerned about the current situation and feels deeply indignant about the current internal strife and political corruption.

Requesting Thorough Reform

The demand for reform is too high, but generally, people can understand and sympathize with the difficulties and do not advocate passive strikes or meaningless parades. Instead, they advocate suggesting to the government to request thorough reform. (3) Increase loans and subsidies to help poor students in Shanghai. (4) Improve the treatment of teachers and staff. (5) Ask the education authorities to rectify the school buildings and school spirit, and hire more professors and increase library and equipment facilities. (6) Increase sports facilities to improve student health. (7) Ask the government to immediately organize military training. (8) Ask the government authorities to eliminate traitors in the education community and stop commercialized schools. The meeting adjourned at 12:00 noon.

### Go to the Countryside, Put Down the Peddler's Package, and Put on the Seed Bag

50th Anniversary of the Founding of the American Agricultural School Recalling the Famous Words of the Great Russian Writer Tolstoy

[Associated Press New York 15th] Although the great Russian writer Tolstoy never set foot on American soil, an exclusive school dedicated to agriculture in the United States was established in accordance with his wishes. That is the American Agricultural School, located in Doylestown, Pennsylvania, which is celebrating its 50th anniversary this year.

Tracing the history of the school's founding, we must first mention Dr. Krausoff, an American Jew from Philadelphia. In 1894, Dr. Krausoff visited Russia with a plan to relocate Jews persecuted around the world to uninhabited areas within Russia to reclaim wasteland and live by farming. At this time, Tsar Alexander III happened to be very ill, and Dr. Krausoff had no way to see the Tsar and present this proposal. Tolstoy, who had always advocated living in the countryside, heard this information and invited Dr. Krausoff to his home, where he listened to Dr. Krausoff's story under that "poor tree." Tolstoy used to listen to the complaints of poor and destitute people under this tree. Now, after listening to Dr. Krausoff's opinions, he criticized:

"Your ambition to lead your people back to the soil and return to the profession that your ancestors honorably engaged in in Palestine indeed gives me some encouragement, showing that the day is dawning and there is hope. This is the only solution to the Jewish question. Jews are persecuted everywhere and not allowed to own land or cultivate land, not allowed to join trade unions, and as a result, they have to rely on commerce to survive, but merchants are hated by the world. Making your people bread producers will earn the respect of the world. The plan for Jewish colonies, which wants to be implemented in Russia, now has little hope, but if this plan cannot be implemented in Russia, why can't it succeed in America? Lead your people to the countryside, to the rural areas, set up agricultural schools for them, teach them, throw away the yardstick, pick up the hoe, put down the peddler's package, and put on the seed bag. This will solve the problem that remains to be solved. In the future, you will see their land filled with milk and honey, just like before. They will supply the local people with the surplus, turning it into profit and the respect of others. Then many prophets, legislators, poets, and teachers will rise up among the Jewish farmers, praised and sung by the civilized world!"

Tolstoy's wish came true in 1896, because the American Agricultural School was founded in that year. The school's initial purpose was to educate young people in cities, especially Jewish youth, to receive agricultural training so that they could engage in farming after graduating. For fifty years, young people from major cities in the United States have come to study. In the beginning, there was only one school building and 122 acres of land. Now, it expands every year, including all aspects of agriculture, farm management, marketing, floriculture, horticulture, and other departments. There is no partisan color in the school, and the students are all young people between the ages of seventeen and twenty-one. Living together, working together in the fields, reading together in the classroom, and playing together on the grass, it is truly a scene of innocence!

### Scholarship Basketball Charity Game - Osina's Brilliant Shots - Chinese Alliance Team Defeated After Fierce Fighting - Chinese Youth Team Lost to US Sea Bees - Two Final Battles Tomorrow Night

The scholarship basketball charity game co-sponsored by this newspaper and Tongde Medical College held its second night last night. The competition between the Chinese and American champions was wonderful. Although there was light rain, the fans were still crowded, and the situation was even more enthusiastic than the first night. As a result, the Chinese Alliance was defeated by Osina by only three points, 43 to 40, after a fierce competition. In the first half, the Osina team took the lead with 24 to 19. In the Chinese Youth vs. Sea Bees game, the Chinese Youth lost 20 to 31.

From Prosperity to Decline - Chinese Youth Defeated: The Chinese Youth vs. US Sea Bees first appeared. The referees were Yu Julu and Xuan He. When the silver whistle sounded, the great battle began. The US team's tactics were clever, and the Chinese Youth was also very cautious. The competition was extremely fierce. In the first half, the Chinese Youth took the lead by one point with 10 to 9. In the second half, the Chinese Youth, having fought hard for days, inevitably showed signs of exhaustion. The US Sea Bees took the opportunity to advance and scored four consecutive goals, taking the lead with 18 to 10. The Chinese Youth then used a wheel-substitution tactic, frequently changing players. He Jingui's luck came, and he scored four points, gradually getting closer, but the US military became braver and braver. The Chinese Youth was no match for them and had no choice. The US Sea Bees defeated the Chinese Youth with 31 to 10. The US Sea Bees' left forward, Mitchell, scored the most points and was fearsomely agile.

Chinese Alliance Takes the Lead - Difficult to Separate: The game between the US military champion team Osina and the Chinese Alliance began next, and the audience's spirits were refreshed. The referees were Liang Zhaoan and Chen Liang. The game unfolded after the ball was thrown by Mr. Wang Xiaolai. The Chinese Alliance's Bo Tuo and Chen Xuesong scored consecutively, getting two goals first, but the Osina team quickly caught up 4-4, 6-6, 8-8, 10-10, 12-12. The game became deadlocked, difficult to separate. The atmosphere on the court was extremely tense. The Chinese Alliance always took the lead, and the fans were very excited. The US military scored continuously, and the situation changed dramatically.

The US military urgently sought to break the deadlock, changed their strategy, and indeed achieved a perfect result, scoring ten consecutive points, and the situation changed dramatically. The Chinese Alliance urgently called a timeout and rearranged their lineup. Li Zhenzhong's most wonderful passing, like butterflies fluttering, fully displayed his ball skills, and gradually caught up. In the first half, Osina had 24 points, and the Chinese Alliance had 19 points.

Every Shot Hits - Chinese Alliance Fights Hard:

At the start of the second half, Osina's momentum was still strong, shooting with one hand, almost every shot hitting, amazing to watch. The US military then took the lead, taking the lead with 34 to 23 in an instant. Although under heavy pressure, the Chinese Alliance continued to fight hard, adopting long-range shots, which were quite successful. However, the difference between the scores remained the same, although they were getting closer and closer, but the time was limited, and Osina defeated the Chinese Alliance with 43 to 40.

Tomorrow Night's Second Victory - The Last Two Games:

Tomorrow (18th) from 7:30 PM, is the last two games, still held at the original location. The Chinese team will still be represented by the Chinese Youth and Chinese Alliance teams against the US Sea Bees and Osina teams.

### National Fudan University's College of Agriculture

— Ji Yingchou

Since Fudan University moved westward to Beibei, the cultural center of the rear area, it has been renamed National Fudan University. It now has six colleges: Liberal Arts, Science, Engineering, Agriculture, Commerce, and Law. There are over four thousand professors and students. Located between Huangjueshu and Dongyang Towns on the north bank of the Jialing River, it has naturally become a university town. A long, neat row of tung trees along the river embellishes the university town, making it even more beautiful.

This is a field of more than four hundred mu, backed by mountains and facing the water. Although there are no majestic school buildings, rows upon rows of Fudan's simple houses, interspersed with fences and small bridges, are simple and unadorned, yet they appear solemn and serene, exuding a tranquility unique to the countryside, truly a good environment for studying. The campus is lush with flowers and trees everywhere, with different scenery in each season. One can imagine the endless joy for the numerous students.

With this advantageous "geography," Fudan University is doing its best to develop its College of Agriculture. University students study in classrooms and practice in the fields. Knowledge and experience are mutually verified, cultivating well-educated modern farmers who will become a vital force supporting the country's industrialization.

They are busy cultivating silkworms, planting and roasting tea leaves, and have achieved great results. What is particularly commendable is the chemically produced "Fudan Soy Sauce," available in both white and black varieties. The taste is extremely delicious. The people of Beibei all praise it, and even those dozens of kilometers away have heard of it and are vying to buy it, so much so that supply cannot meet demand. Even the faculty and staff at the school can only purchase it under a "rationing system." In addition, there are considerable facilities for fish ponds, milk farms, chicken farms, etc. Given time, the future of Fudan University's College of Agriculture is truly limitless!

### Higher Court Takes Strict Precautions: Traitor Cases Tried in Prison; Detention Center Attached to Shanghai Prison; Criminal Court and Prosecutor's Office to Centralize Operations Starting Today

Yesterday, this reporter visited Xiang Zhejun, Chief Prosecutor of the Higher Court, to inquire about the latest situation in the investigation of traitor cases. According to him, in order to facilitate the handling of traitor cases and to ensure the security of traitor prisoners, it has been decided that a temporary prosecutor's office will be established in Tilanqiao Shanghai Prison starting today. Designated prosecutors and clerks will be stationed there to work. Previously, the Higher Court and the District Court Prosecutor's Office conducted interrogations in the courthouse in the French Concession and sent prisoners to the Masnan Road Detention Center. If indicted, the prisoners had to be transferred to the Higher Court on North Zhejiang Road for trial. The separation of the court and the temporary detention center made it difficult to detain traitors. To coordinate efforts, this office has also decided to set up a temporary office in the prison and has notified military and police agencies that traitor prisoners, case files, and evidence should be delivered to the Tilanqiao temporary prosecutor's office for processing. Note by this reporter: Traitor cases, except those involving former military personnel who served in puppet military positions, which are handled by military tribunals, should all be sent to the Higher Prosecutor's Office for investigation. It is also heard that all major traitors arrested in the city will be transferred to the Higher Prosecutor's Office for investigation shortly.

(Daguan News Agency) The arrested Wen Lanting, Yuan Ludeng, and Lin Kanghou are still allowed to read newspapers every day and are served four dishes and a soup for each meal. Since his imprisonment, Yuan Ludeng has given up alcohol. Wen Lanting has also unusually become taciturn. Lin Kanghou looks haggard and dejected.

### Maintaining Postal Service Between Tianjin and Shanghai: Establishment of Courier Team

According to sources from the Shanghai Post Office, due to the damage to the Tianjin-Pukou Railway in two sections, one above Xuzhou and one above Bengbu, mail from Shanghai to Tianjin cannot be delivered directly by rail. To maintain postal service, the Post Office has dispatched Inspector Feng to Xuzhou to organize a land-based courier service. Where the railway tracks are damaged, human porters will carry the mail to compensate for the shortcomings of train transfers. According to Inspector Feng's report, the land-based courier team has been organized and is ready. Postal service between Shanghai and North China is now unimpeded. For the Huai area, mail is limited to lightweight items; parcels and heavy items should not be sent for the time being.

### Newly Appointed French Ambassador to China, M. Meyrier, to Arrive in China

The newly appointed French Ambassador to China, M.

It is understood that negotiations between China and France on the revision of treaties will actively commence after Ambassador Meyrier takes office. The Vietnam issue will also be discussed further based on the points raised by our side.

### Uniform Regulations for Shipping Fares and Ticket Prices to Take Effect on New Year's Day; Shipping Association Requests Allocation of Fuel

After the victory, our government is extremely concerned about the resumption of navigation on various routes. However, due to the lack of fuel, the routes are not smooth, operating intermittently and with unreliable schedules. A Fuel Management Committee has been established to manage and allocate fuel. All imported coal is under the committee's management. However, some privately-owned shipping companies have not been allocated fuel, forcing them to purchase fuel on the black market. Black market coal costs around 100,000 yuan per ton, while the official price is only 24,000 yuan per ton, a difference of more than four times. Therefore, in order to maintain their capital, shipping companies have increased freight rates and ticket prices on their own, which has affected travelers, hindered the circulation of local products, and indirectly increased prices. This situation is of great concern. Shipping companies have repeatedly complained to the Shipping Association. The Association has confirmed that the biggest blow to the shipping industry is the lack of fuel. After repeated meetings, it was decided to submit a request to the Director of Navigation and the Municipal Bureau of Navigation, as well as the Fuel Management Committee, to find ways to remedy the situation, and to list seven matters that should be given priority in fuel allocation. Regarding passenger ticket prices and freight rates, which in the past were set by each company individually and varied, the Ministry of Communications recently instructed the Municipal Bureau of Navigation to unify prices. The Bureau has transferred this to the Shipping Association for rectification. The Director of the Bureau of Navigation, Li Gufan, the Secretary of the Association, Li Yunliang, and the Chairman of the Association's Rate Committee, Hu Shiyuan, have held several meetings and solicited opinions from members. It has been decided that starting on New Year's Day of the 35th year of the Republic (1946), freight rates and ticket prices must not be increased or decreased arbitrarily, in order to standardize them. The prices are currently being finalized and will be announced soon.

### District Offices to Be Established by Deadline

The Shanghai Municipal Government has divided the city into thirty-three districts for the purpose of reorganizing the Baojia system and establishing district offices. The jurisdictions of each district have also been re-designated by the municipal authorities into two levels, A and B. The establishment of district offices is mandated to be completed by the 25th of this month, in order to begin the census. The Municipal Civil Affairs Bureau will soon convene a joint meeting of all district chiefs to prepare for all proceedings.

### Over One Hundred Cases of Concealing Enemy Assets Accepted

Regarding the reporting of concealed enemy assets, the Central Trust Bureau has announced that, as of last month, it has accepted over one hundred and twenty cases. Most of these were voluntarily reported by Japanese merchants, while the rest were materials handed over by the Third Front Army for management. The Bureau will allocate perishable items to the Jianghai Customs for auction in the short term. All other machinery, grains, fabrics, etc., will be categorized and stored in the Bureau's warehouse, pending a decision on how to dispose of them after reporting to the Enemy Assets Management Bureau.

### Year-End Cleaning

### Garrison Command Establishes Telecommunications Inspection Section to Inspect Radio Stations and Register Radios

The Songhu Garrison Command has received an order from the Military Affairs Commission to move the former Kunming Area Telecommunications Inspection Section to Shanghai and rename it the Shanghai Area Telecommunications Inspection Section, under the jurisdiction of the Garrison Command.

Civilians who wish to purchase radio materials must first obtain a purchase permit from the section, and then purchase from the merchant with the permit. All radio receiver users in the city must register with the section before the end of this month, and can only listen after passing the inspection.

### Families of Victims of Minlian Ship Shooting Request Compensation

In the case of the Minlian ship accidentally injuring Jin Yunkai, the executive officer of the Yong'an warship, near Zhenjiang on its way from Chongqing to Shanghai, resulting in his death, because the military police on board who fired the gun and the deceased were both military personnel, the case has been submitted to the National Shipping Allocation Committee for handling and mediation. It has been learned that the families of the deceased recently contacted the Shanghai authorities of the Minsheng Company with a letter, requesting the company to pay all funeral expenses and 12 million yuan in living expenses for the families.

### Robbery in Nanshi Last Night

Kang Le Stationery Shop at No. 208 Fangxie Road, Nanshi, was visited by several robbers at around 6:50 PM last night. They robbed four gold rings, one coat, and over 300,000 yuan in puppet currency.

### After Receiving the Lingdong Iron Factory, Stationed Staff Members Attacked; Hu Lishan Injured, Gao Qihong Missing

(This newspaper report) The Japanese-owned Lingdong Iron Factory, located near Gongping Road and Yuezhou Road, which was taken over by the Special Commissioner's Office of the Ministry of Economic Affairs in Jiangsu and Zhejiang some time ago, had two stationed staff members, Hu Lishan and Gao Qihong, guarding it. The other day (the 14th), Hu's nephew, Che Yannian, went to the factory to visit, and saw that the room was closed. Thinking they were out on business, he did not suspect anything. The next day, he went again, and it was still the same. He knocked on the door several times, but there was no response. He felt strange. After a while, he saw Hu open the door with bloodstains on his clothes and two injuries to his head. Before he could speak, he fainted to the ground. He hired a car to take him to Hudong Hospital for treatment, and it is heard that the injury is very severe. He immediately reported to the police for investigation. At the same time, Gao Qihong is missing, and his whereabouts are unknown. According to what this reporter learned afterwards, a villain had gone to persuade them to collude in stealing and selling iron materials, but failed, resulting in the attack. The military and police agencies have launched an investigation and are pursuing the perpetrators.

### US Military Supplies Flood the Market

Since the arrival of the US military in Shanghai, a large number of supplies have been coming in, and at the same time, a black market has emerged. Tax-free cigarettes, beer, chocolate, canned food, etc., can be seen everywhere. US soldiers spend only eight US cents for a pack of cigarettes, while American cigarettes on the black market cost more than 500 yuan in national currency. As Christmas approaches, US military supplies have increased compared to before, and the black market is becoming more prosperous. The reason is that US enlisted men earn about 50 US dollars per month. Although the military provides them with clothing and food, Shanghai's dance halls and entertainment venues are places where people spend money like water. Many US soldiers spend as much as possible after receiving their salaries, and are penniless in a few days, so they have to sell their military supplies to compensate for their economic difficulties. The American people have the slogan "Army First" and often save materials as much as possible to supply their overseas troops.

### Cancellation of Hotel Tips is Being Negotiated

Hotels in this city have a so-called "small tip" and "tiny tip". The municipal authorities believe that this evil practice violates the New Life Movement and should be banned. Therefore, they are discussing with responsible persons from the Hotel Industry Association. The result is that tea servers in each hotel should be given a reasonable and sustainable wage by the hotel, and all "small tips" and "tiny tips" should be cancelled. It is heard that this measure will be implemented on a scheduled basis.

### US Military Vehicle Hits Pedestrians

[This newspaper report] At the intersection of Zhongzheng Road and Lianyun Road, at approximately 7:13 PM last night, a US military truck sped past and knocked down four pedestrians. Qu Qiangxing was injured in the face, Xu Taolan was injured in both hands, a foreign man named Helen was injured internally, and a middle-aged woman named Yan Shuhe, who was riding in a rickshaw, was injured in the face. Afterwards, they were taken to Gongji Hospital for treatment by a US ambulance.

### Leprosarium Appeals for Assistance

The first batch of large yellow croaker began to be sold on the 8th of this month, at a price of 112 yuan per catty in legal tender. Now, the prices of pork and beef are pending determination and will also be sold at discounted prices. Also, the Bureau previously set the price of sugar to be sold at a discounted price at 500 yuan per catty, but now, due to falling prices, it has been decided to adjust the price to 300 yuan per catty.

### Restoring Brightness: Restoring Streetlights in the Urban Area

During the enemy and puppet era, the streetlights in this city were all converted to five candlepower due to lighting control, and anti-aircraft shields were added. Other traffic lights, platform lights, dock lights, and park lights were all demolished, so the nights were extremely dark. Since the liberation of this city, the authorities have found ways to replace light bulbs and gradually renovate them. The roads have been greatly illuminated. However, the streetlights in some urban areas, such as Chifeng, Zhabei, etc., were too severely damaged at the time, and it is currently impossible to fully restore them immediately due to limited resources and manpower. The Public Utilities Bureau is currently restoring more than 350 lights in the areas of Zhonghua Road, Minguo Road, Heping Road Ninghe Road, Penglai Road and Fangbang Road, and it is scheduled to install them successively on other important roads within the lunar year to facilitate the citizens.

### Visiting the Japanese Prisoner of War Camp - Hoping They Reflect and Awaken - The "Flower Garden Unit" Were All Very Happy

Yesterday morning, the Third Military Region's Shanghai-Nanjing Prisoner of War Administration Office hosted a tea party for Chinese and foreign journalists in the city. Director Wang Guanghan reported on the office's work and accompanied the journalists on a tour of three concentration camps, one of which housed female military personnel, the so-called "Flower Garden Unit." Perhaps some people think we treat prisoners of war, especially Japanese prisoners, too leniently. But based on the principles of "repaying malice with virtue" and "honoring the Way and valuing righteousness," we don't think it's worth it to beat a defeated dog in the water. Now, we should provide them with an opportunity to reflect and realize their past mistakes, hoping that after returning home, they will re-recognize China and establish a new democratic Japan.

The first place we visited was the Jiangwan Sixteenth Concentration Camp, which was previously the arrogant Thirteenth Army's Denglong Unit in Shanghai, numbering 2,400 people. Lieutenant General Matsui Takuhiko was in charge. There, we heard a report from Captain Kasai about the concentration situation in the Shanghai area and the conditions of service, education, and hygiene. He said that there were currently 70,000 officers and soldiers concentrated in forty concentration camps in Jiangwan and Wusong, all under the command of the administration office. Recently, regarding service, they are divided into groups to repair roads and railways. Education focuses on instilling new ideas and improving agriculture, supplemented by Chinese and English. In terms of hygiene, cholera broke out this summer, resulting in 300 deaths, but it has recently been eradicated. When reporters asked about their impressions of China's preferential treatment, Chief of Staff Doi said: "Officers and soldiers, both high and low, are very grateful. From now on, we will deeply reflect and thoroughly correct our past mistakes."

The second place we visited was the Wusong Second Concentration Camp, headed by Major General Nashioka, with 1,800 people. Their barracks were temporarily built by themselves, and the officers and soldiers lived in relatively simple conditions, with approximately twelve people in each room. According to Nashioka, they lacked knowledge and had very few books, only one type of "Reformed Daily News," and they hoped to have more "spiritual food."

Finally, we visited the "Flower Garden Unit," a unit entirely composed of female military personnel. They were recruited by the Japanese domestic headquarters, numbering 1,075 people, aged from fifteen to twenty-four. Their duties were limited to typing, switchboard operation, secretarial work, and nursing in the military. These days, they are practicing shorthand. When Director Wang gave a speech, everyone's faces showed great happiness.

Because there was a planned symposium at the Sixteenth Concentration Camp, we rushed there. At the symposium, everyone frankly raised questions and discussed them until 6 o'clock before dispersing.

These Japanese girls were all recruited, the so-called "Flower Garden Unit." They stood and listened quietly to Director Wang Guanghan's speech, feeling happy, and also feeling that the war had brought them emptiness, cruelty, and was a gift from the Japanese militarists.

### American Female Soldiers in Shanghai

— Mai Tian

At the desolate intersection of Julu Road and Gubart Road, a large, old-fashioned Western-style building stands quietly. An American military police officer stands at the gate, looking very lonely. This used to be the staff dormitory of the Yokohama Specie Bank, but now it has become the residence of the U.S. Army Women's Army Corps (formerly the Women's Auxiliary Army Corps) members in Shanghai.

The reporter specially went to interview Captain Harmon, the commander of the women's corps. Faintly hearing the melodious sound of the piano, and then proceeding to the living room, one felt a sense of peace and comfort. About a dozen members were seen, some wearing skirts, some wearing trousers; some standing and smoking, some sitting on the carpet sewing clothes, some lying on the sofa; and some sitting on the sofa with their knees bent, writing letters. Everyone was talking in low voices, and only one young lady was playing "Sweetheart." This warm and relaxed atmosphere was truly enviable. Later, I learned that this group of them were lucky people, preparing to board a ship to return home, so they did not have to work.

Just as I walked into their office, Captain Harmon called to say that she couldn't get there right away because she didn't have a car. Fortunately, I didn't have to talk to her personally, so Staff Sergeant Belys led me to visit the various places. It is said that there are currently sixty-two female corps members in Shanghai, of whom twenty-eight will be leaving here to go home soon, but soon about fifty new members will come to Shanghai from the United States. Miss Belys herself is one of the lucky ones, having served in the army for forty months, making her one of the most senior members. She has been to Calcutta, India, and Chongqing. She used to work as a clerk in a department store in New York. Now, most of the members are working indoors in various departments of the British Royal Air Force. Miss Belys is responsible for sales work in the dormitory.

"During the war, we all liked to come abroad to work, both to serve the country and to see many new places," this is what Miss Belys told me, explaining why she liked to come abroad.

Walking into their recreation room, there was a ping pong table placed in a spacious rectangular room with a smooth and clean floor, where they usually held dances. Outside is a lawn with two tennis courts, which is more than enough for sixty or so young ladies to exercise outdoors. Afterwards, I also visited their dining hall, where they have two American army chefs. Guests are welcome to come to lunch and dinner, and of course, American soldiers are regular guests. Then I went upstairs to visit their bedrooms. Miss Dolores Nashi, also a staff sergeant, was wearing a purple-red shirt and writing a letter on the bed. When Miss Nashi saw Miss Belys, she asked when there would be a ship, but Miss Belys didn't know either.

"We all like Shanghai very much, but of course, we all want to go home!" said Miss Nashi.

Although we only talked for a few words, I found Miss Nashi very sincere and straightforward, and Miss Belys was also very patient in telling me this and that. There are about forty bedrooms on the second and third floors, but because they need to prepare beds for future arrivals, they are a bit crowded. Some rooms have two beds, some have three, and some have bunk beds. They also showed me the light taupe-colored clothes they wear after leaving the office, as well as winter coats, which are almost the same style as men's military uniforms. Miss Nashi said that most of her things have been packed, and she is just waiting for the day to leave. Each person can bring 185 pounds on the ship when they go back, and they can usually send 70 pounds of things home every month. When they were in India, they could only send 10 pounds of things a month.

Speaking of their usual entertainment, it's nothing more than shopping, watching movies, and dancing. Many American soldiers and sailors look for them to play with, which they find a bit of a headache. "However, when you know them for a long time, you can really find that they are all very good," Miss Nashi explained for the boys' mischief, "They sometimes tell jokes to Chinese girls, but they don't mean to at all. We know their temperaments, so they can't fool around with us." Miss Belys added, "We all understand our boys."

When asked about their impression of Shanghai, Miss Nashi said, "Shanghai is not the real China, Chongqing represents China." Miss Nashi had also been to Hangzhou and visited West Lake, and thought Hangzhou was very fun.

We talked for about ten minutes, and we were like old friends. When I said goodbye to Miss Nashi and went downstairs, Miss Belys pointed out their sales department, where various cigarettes, candies, supplies, and shirts, shoes, and antiques bought from the army exchange were displayed for the members to buy. It is said that they get thirty packs of cigarettes a month and twelve pairs of silk stockings a year, but in fact they have to buy more themselves. They also admire the cheongsams worn by Chinese women and have already made several, preparing to wear them when they go home.

At this time, the captain came back. She was quite young, very kind and charming. She is in charge of all the female corps members and is expected to be in the last batch to return home. Speaking of Shanghai, I honestly told her that it has regressed a bit compared to before. She said, "After the war is over, it will take a few more years to restore the previous situation!"

The residence of the U.S. Women's Auxiliary Army Corps is located on the relatively remote Julu Road. If you pass by there unintentionally, you may not notice it. This building has many rooms and all the necessary equipment, quiet and comfortable. The attached sales department sells various daily necessities, which the members flock to!

Because it was getting late, I didn't ask any more personal questions. So I stepped back onto the quiet asphalt road and said goodbye.

On the way back, I thought of that group of American young ladies who came to China for the first time. Like us, they feel that the gap between the two sides is still very deep. Undoubtedly, many of them cannot truly recognize China or understand the Chinese people. This is a good opportunity, I thought, why don't we let us contact them more and build a real friendship together!

The residence of the U.S. Women's Auxiliary Army Corps is located on the relatively remote Julu Road. If you pass by there unintentionally, you may not notice it. This building has many rooms and all the necessary equipment, quiet and comfortable. The attached sales department sells various daily necessities, which the members flock to, making it an excellent place to pass the time.

Spring and Autumn

### Repentance

—

Yun: You and I don't write letters, and I completely admit my mistake; but you should know my bad habits, the more important things are, the less I do them, and the more I should write, the less I write. I also understand that because of this habit, I have messed up many things and been scolded many times, but the habit is still a habit, "It's easier to change mountains and rivers than to alter one's nature." My recent failure to write letters is for this reason.

It's raining heavily again, the air pressure is so low that it's suffocating. People who don't smoke are smoking wildly. I'm pacing back and forth in my small attic room in Shanghai, going around and around in such a small circle. I want to sleep, to temporarily forget everything, to ignore everything, but I know I won't be able to fall asleep; I want to rush out, but where can I go? Shanghai is so noisy and complex, and people are so selfish and ruthless. What am I like wandering the streets? What is the purpose of running to people's doors randomly? You should ask why I don't write to you? Alas, I can only write a few random sentences to you.

What stings me the most is your words: "You left quietly before, leaving me in Shanghai under the iron hooves; now you have left lightly again, leaving me in the noisy Chongqing. In Shanghai, I suffered five years of disaster because of the iron hooves. Now, the noise is surrounding this cage-like Chongqing, and I can't fly away again! Moreover, I have been away from home for eight years, you should find a way to let me go home." Yun, these words stung my heart, and I shed tears again. If you say that my ability to fly out of Chongqing lightly this time is a "victory," then I am truly "triumphing at a great cost." This costly victory is not only because of my separation from you, but also a symbol of all the unexpected suffering after I arrived in Shanghai.

I do regret it, I shouldn't have flown here alone so naively, because I am neither a "receiver" nor have the ambition to "pass the imperial examination." What's the use of coming so early? If it's for my elderly parents whom I haven't seen for eight years, I haven't even gone to the countryside to visit them in the three months I've been in Shanghai. Now, I'm letting my elderly parents with their waning years continue to wait for their only son. They will definitely curse: "The war is over, why hasn't our son come back yet?" Now, I'm also letting you stay in the boiling pot of Chongqing, living the life of ants on a hot pot. You are anxious and worried, which is understandable.

When I left, I left you ten thousand yuan in royalties, but I also left you two children. Ten thousand yuan, at a time when it is depreciating more and more with each victory, what can you do with it? The two sons are constantly shouting for food and drink, and the older one is so naughty, which not only increases the material burden but also countless mental burdens. Yun, you are too bitter and too tired. You only had one child in Shanghai, and you were already overwhelmed. Originally, with your body and our situation, we shouldn't have had any sons. You went to Chongqing, and unfortunately another one was added. With your body and our situation, we shouldn't have two sons even more. If there were no sons, we would have fled together eight years ago, lightly and quickly fleeing to the rear. If there were no sons, you could work in the rear. A "literary person," even if she is a woman, would have no problem working as a clerk in a government office. With tens of thousands of yuan in salary and a stone of rice, you would have enough to cover your expenses. We would cooperate and live separately, giving both of us completely to the public. The time left over every day would still be our own. In this way, our life would be stable and worry-free, and our happiness would never be deprived. It is because of the two children that we have to raise our own money for clothing, food, housing, transportation, firewood, rice, oil, and salt. How can my meager income as a poor civil servant be enough to cover the expenses of this family? So you have suffered, working hard day and night. You work for nineteen hours a day, and even five hours of sleep a night are deprived by half because of Xiao Yang. I can see you getting thinner and thinner every day, and I can't reduce your pain. This is because I have read a little too many pedantic Chinese books, which make me unable to do anything. Otherwise, I could have used my power to find some "extra money," or partnered with others to run some business. At the same time, I also blame you for not being willing to abandon your empty titles of "scion of a noble family" and "literary scholar" and learn the new methods of your neighbors, such as setting up a cigarette stall or buying and selling used clothes.

I regret it very much, I shouldn't have let you have children. I regret it very much, and I shouldn't have let you have children when you arrived in Chongqing. I especially regret that when victory suddenly came, I was as overjoyed and rejoicing as a primary school student. So I ignored everything and flew to Shanghai rashly. I thought this was how I could go home and see my elderly parents whom I hadn't seen for eight years; I also thought that you and the two children could come soon. My ideal was not bad either. I would first look at relatives and friends in Shanghai, write letters home, and let my family tidy up a room for me to read in; tidy up a piece of grass for Xiao Yang to play on; tidy up some tools for Da Yang to experiment with. When you come, the four of us, big and small, will slowly walk back on the road we left eight years ago, intimately recognizing the mountains, rivers, fields, cattle, sheep, grass, and trees along the way, and even touching the wind, sun, moonlight along the way.

Then we will cry and laugh to our heart's content in front of our elderly parents, collect the regrets of our eight years of separation, and end our eight years of precarious life. But this has not yet been realized. Especially you, who gave up the thatched cottage in the countryside and sold the excess old clothes, you were convinced that you could sit on the ship, but who knew that most of the ships were taken by "gold bar refugees." Those without gold bars cannot sit, so you are trapped in the turbulent and foggy city of Chongqing.

That is to say, we were originally only divided into two places, but with victory, we are divided into three places. The old home has no enemies, but we still can't go back; you don't have gold bars, so you can't come down. But I am suspended in the middle, unable to see my parents or my wife. Where is my victory?

### Sacrifice

— Luo Hong

Historical Knowledge

Seeing Jing Ke arriving so late, they all shouted for him to be punished with three cups. As they said this, a large bowl of hot wine was already handed to Jing Ke. Jing Ke drank the wine in one gulp and sighed, "The Qin state is really too domineering. Who knows how many more times we will have such a painful drink?"

The butcher Dog Tu recklessly continued, "We drink when we have wine, and eat when we have meat. Why bother sighing and saying these strange and old-fashioned words!"

Gao Jianli also hurriedly said, "You can't blame Jing Ke for that. With the Qin state being so tyrannical, we will inevitably suffer a great loss from it sooner or later!"

"That's right!" Jing Ke said. "I, Jing Ke, am determined to repay my country with my death. When necessary, I will never cherish this life."

After saying this, Jing Ke drank the second bowl of wine in one gulp. Gao Jianli and Dog Tu also silently drank their wine. Everyone was silent for a while, and Gao Jianli also sighed:

"No wonder I just passed through Middle Street and saw a large group of bookworms gathered there talking about 'horizontal alliance' and 'vertical alliance.' Some people said that if the Qin state sends troops east to attack Qi and Chu, the Yan state will certainly not be spared and must quickly think of a 'vertical alliance.' Some people said to unite the three Jins with Qi and Chu, and then together with the Huns to attack Qin, in order to save the situation in the event of an emergency. But some people also said that the 'vertical alliance' plan is time-consuming and protracted. Now the King of Han has already been captured, and his abandoned soldiers are threatening the capital of the Zhao state. We can only inspire our morale: repay the country with death. They argued back and forth, making a lot of noise."

Hearing this, Jing Ke drank the third bowl of wine in one gulp, saying word by word:

"Repay the country with death—repay the country with death."

Gao Jianli and Dog Tu couldn't help but glance at Jing Ke. Jing Ke's face was so excited, he opened his eyes wide and looked at the dark sky outside the window.

At this time, a person walked into the tavern and asked the proprietress if she sold wine here. The accent was very stiff, not like the way people in the Yan state spoke. Jing Ke saw him sitting at a table next to him, so he leaned over and asked:

"General, are you from the Qin state?"

That person was startled, but immediately calmed down and said, "I did flee from the Qin state to here. May I ask, how did you know this, despite our casual meeting?"

Jing Ke smiled and said:

"I heard that General Fan Yuqi came from the Qin state. Just now I heard that you have a Qin accent, so I asked. "The rash Dog Tu did not understand what the words "fled from" meant, only heard that he came from the Qin state, and was already itching to draw his knife. Gao Jianli hurriedly stopped him and said in a low voice, "The King of Qin is cruel and tyrannical. General Fan has offended the King of Qin and fled to the Yan state. Since we hate the tyranny of the King of Qin, how can we condemn General Fan!"

Gao Jianli's low words were also heard very clearly by Fan Yuqi; he was deeply moved by this kind of sympathy from a foreign country. "I have always heard that there are many generous and tragic patriots in the Yan and Zhao states, so I would rather wander to this place," he said.

Jing Ke and Gao Jianli thought he was straightforward and outstanding, so they invited him to sit at a table and drink wine. Gao Jianli also asked him if he knew that the King of Qin was offering a high price for his head?

Fan Yuqi sighed for a long time and said slowly: "When I crossed the Yi River and came to your country, I had already offered my head to the people of your country. On the one hand, I know that there are many generous and tragic patriots in Yan and Zhao, and on the other hand, I admire the wisdom of Prince Dan of Yan, so I did not hesitate to be presumptuous. Sure enough, Prince Dan took me in, and I will be grateful for the rest of my life." (To be continued)

### Do Not Abandon the Art Scene

— Wen Zhaotong

During the war of resistance, the group that displayed the weakest strength was our art workers. Now that the war of resistance is won, all departments are clamoring for "rehabilitation"! But in our art circles, we don't hear anyone shouting "rehabilitation"! Of course, shouting "rehabilitation" is just lip service; the most important thing is to do it practically.

But even more strangely, Shanghai, which was originally an extremely prosperous art market, has become depressed after the victory and is about to stagnate, like the Chinese Painting Academy. Exhibitions have become a rarity. As for art publications, at least there is a weekly publication called "Art Life." Somewhere, a "Victory Woodcut" was published. Occasionally, one or two short articles commenting on art can be found in other newspapers, but that seems to be it.

Indeed, most art workers have changed careers due to the hardship of life, and exhibitions cannot be held due to excessive costs. The so-called art movement simply cannot be launched.

Shanghai is truly the birthplace of China's emerging art. To this day, there still exists the Shanghai Fine Arts School, with its long history, and many strong art workers around it. We only need to recall that the "model" issue in the past was a pioneering effort that was initiated in Shanghai and finally overcame feudal ethics. Now, is it really so difficult? I think, if the art workers gathered in Shanghai can unite to launch work, any ideal, whether it be art exhibitions, art publications, art galleries, art research institutes, art lectures... will slowly be realized. First of all, we hope that the art workers in Shanghai will stand together to generate strength.

Finally, I hope everyone will not forget: "Shanghai is the birthplace of China's emerging art."

### Social Service: Student Discussion Meeting, Instructing the True Meaning of Youth Service

Five Hundred Students Greatly Inspired

Yesterday morning at 9 o'clock, this office convened a discussion meeting for aided students from high schools, vocational schools, universities, and other schools in the city. A total of 85 units and more than 560 students attended, gathering together, which was very lively. First, Mr. Huang Jiping reported on the purpose of the meeting, saying that this newspaper has been advocating the student aid movement for five years, and a total of more than 25,000 students have been aided. In the past, during the enemy's occupation, gatherings and speeches lacked freedom, and they could not communicate with each other, which was deeply regrettable! Now, the War of Resistance has been won, the world has been restored to light, and everything has been restored to freedom. It is especially gratifying to meet with you all. In the future, the focus of this office's work will still be on student aid, so that you will not lose the opportunity to study due to poverty, but instead be inspired to move forward. However, today's youth are the cornerstone of the future society, and at this time, they should practice serving society to repay the great kindness of loving youth. Later, Mr. Zhao Zongyu elaborated on the true meaning of serving society, narrating his life experience; instructing young people on how to conduct themselves in the world; citing the words and deeds of ancient heroes, giving examples to illustrate, both serious and humorous, moving the listeners. He also reported on the assessment of service performance and reward methods, which greatly inspired the students. Finally, Mr. Zhuang Keming gave a speech, in which he also described his service experience and business ethics in great detail, and the meeting adjourned at half past ten.

### Letter: Discussing the Continuation of the National Arts Training Class

Dear Editor: When your newspaper resumed publication, you listed advocating public sports as one of the social service undertakings, which we students are overjoyed to read. The Yongnian Taijiquan class was the only public sports undertaking founded by your newspaper on October 1st last year. It used the courtyard of the Taoist Association on Nantong Road as a training ground. It has been held for two sessions since its opening, and its characteristics are: (1) no political meaning, no party or religious colors; (2) no fees are charged, and men, women, old and young can join; (3) the institution has no burden other than printing application forms; (4) teacher Fu Zhongwen teaches completely voluntarily. The master is a descendant of the Yang family's authentic Taijiquan, and he has established the grand ambition of establishing himself and reaching others. He spares time from his business to teach, purely out of obligation, without receiving any reward. He endures severe cold and heat, regardless of wind and rain, four hundred days as one day, which is rarely seen in today's national arts circles in Shanghai. We colleagues are also inspired by Master Fu's noble personality, so we can diligently study and persevere to the end, without the bad habit of starting strong and finishing weak, which is praised by insiders and outsiders. The students have all graduated (the initial stage has come to an end). In this short period of four hundred days, they have benefited greatly in spirit and physical strength and are unwilling to interrupt their studies, so they consult with Master Fu to continue teaching. Because the body and use of Taijiquan can nourish life, defend against insults, heal diseases, and prolong life; it is profound and mysterious, and even if one spends his whole life, it is difficult to complete his studies. Now, two months have passed since the second graduation, and friends from the outside world have been asking when the third class will start. The students feel the earnestness of those who come, and dare to take the liberty of appealing to you to immediately start the third class to satisfy the public's expectations. The ancients did not abandon words because of the person, and the fool may have a gain. Since your newspaper regards serving society as its duty and promotes public sports as its goal, it should not allow this Taijiquan class, which has been held twice with outstanding results, to be interrupted suddenly. If it continues from the third class to the fourth and fifth classes, and even to the tenth and hundredth classes, so that this social undertaking, which benefits the people without costing much, can be continuously promoted, so that thousands of people can reach the realm of longevity together, then will those who benefit only be those who are eagerly looking forward to it today? The future of national public sports in our country truly relies on it. We hereby appeal to you, and wish you good health. Yongnian Taijiquan Class First and Second Term Students Together.

(Note) This office is currently looking for a suitable venue and will make a decision soon, and then announce the enrollment training. - Editor
