### Anti-Axis Powers Acknowledge Japan's Immense War Power; Aircraft and Weapons Gradually Increasing

Tokyo, 1st (Central News Agency dispatch) – The anti-Axis powers are constantly researching to estimate Japan's war power. In particular, the United States has countless evaluators of Japan's war power. The following are the major ones: The US military authorities unanimously acknowledge that Japan possesses immense new military strength. Lieutenant General Stilwell, head of the US Army Ground Forces, based on his experience in Chongqing, declared on January 30 that Japan has 4 million troops that can be deployed to the front lines. The new Under Secretary of the Navy, H. Struve Hensel, warned on February 7 when discussing Japanese military equipment and air power, that Japanese aircraft and weapons are gradually increasing, the closer the US military gets to the Japanese mainland, the greater the damage it will suffer, and the US military must be wary of attacks from new Japanese weapons, rocket shells, and jet-propelled fighters. British military journalist John Cremer, regarding the terrible aspects of Japanese military power, made the following points: (1) The Japanese army has not yet suffered a decisive defeat; (2) Its human resources are immense; (3) Most of its field army consists of new recruits who have not yet participated in actual combat; (4) Its aircraft production volume has ample surplus in addition to replacing losses; (5) Japan is planning to turn the Chinese mainland into a major fortress.

According to a report released by the War Information Bureau on the 21st, regarding the various living conditions in Japan, it concluded that although Japan has been engaged in war for many years, the difficulties have increased, and the attacks of the anti-Axis powers have become more intense, the people and the government are united as one, and there is no sign of frustration in morale.

Editorial

### The Way to Rescue the Chinese Economy

The Asahi Shimbun of Japan published an editorial on February 7th titled "The Way to Revive the Chinese Economy". It has very insightful views on the current state of the Chinese economy, as well as its pathologies and root causes, and therefore its discussion is quite appropriate. For example, China's poverty, due to shrinking production, skyrocketing prices, chaotic controls, and other economic pathologies, are all sufficient to block the path to China's economic revival. In this decisive stage of the Greater East Asia War, all participating countries need to make their resources battle-ready, but China's current economic situation cannot meet this need. Not only are the allied nations worried, but we are especially anxious.

Currently, rather than talking about China's economic revival, it is more practical and effective to first prevent the deepening of China's economic pathologies. The Asahi Shimbun said in its editorial: "Thanks to this new economic policy towards China, the drawbacks of sectionalism in various agencies can be broken, and a unified institution with the nature of a Chinese economic staff headquarters can be realized. Procurement, allocation, sales, and transportation can all be centrally handled and strengthened. This is sufficient to address the core of the problem. The scope of control has been expanded and strengthened from procurement to production and transportation, which can be said to be a greater advance than previous policies." From this perspective, the content of Japan's new economic policy towards China also aims to first rescue China's economic pathologies, and a unified institution for economic control is a necessary step, no matter how it is observed. Wartime controlled economy is a necessary economic policy for participating countries, and the unification of control institutions is to strengthen revenue and expand to production and transportation, improve and perfect the content of controlled economy, and then the controlled economy can be effective and fulfill its benefits for war and people's livelihood.

The Asahi Shimbun editorial also said: "Contributions to occupational duties must not run counter to the stability of people's livelihood. Only in this way can the new policy towards China have its full meaning. The reason why the new policy towards China has not deeply penetrated the hearts of the Chinese people as loudly as its shouts reach the clouds is that it has failed to provide them with real benefits. Therefore, it is extremely necessary to value action over empty words. No matter how lofty the spirit or ideals are, relying solely on rhetoric will not have the power to grasp people's hearts."

This opinion is exactly the same as ours. We have always maintained that in all economic measures in China, the most important thing is to suit the national conditions and popular feelings of China. Only in this way can it become a force for grasping people's hearts. Secondly, economic measures in China must help Chinese officials and people to do it spontaneously and automatically. As Mr. Takashi, president of the Central China Development Company, said in an interview published in the News Report yesterday (1st): "The Japanese certainly want to cooperate with China, but very few can implement plans. Only when the Chinese handle China's economy can they not go against China's inherent human customs, so that the promotion of affairs can be smoothly carried out. If the Chinese can do it automatically, it is the same as the Japanese helping. Therefore, regarding economic handling, the Japanese hope to cooperate, but it should not be the Japanese doing it, but the Chinese themselves." Another example is the fourth item of the main points of Japan's new economic policy towards China: "Although Japan will do its best to assist, all economic activities should be independently and autonomously conducted by the Chinese side, in accordance with the provisions of the alliance treaty." The former is the opinion of the Japanese economic authority in China, and the latter is the statement of the highest Japanese authorities. They completely agree that the Chinese should automatically handle the Chinese economy. This is a remedy for solving China's economic pathologies in the future. Therefore, we are reminded of the current rice price in Shanghai, which has exceeded 100,000 yuan per koku. How should the Chinese and Japanese authorities effectively solve this serious economic crisis that threatens people's livelihood according to the above-mentioned meaning? This is the most realistic and urgent issue.

### Outline of Japan's New Economic Policy Toward China: Promoting Production, Strengthening Transportation Power, Assisting the National Government in Stabilizing Prices and People's Livelihood

In order to strengthen the ties between China, Japan, and Manchukuo, and consolidate the rear area system, the Japanese government, in close contact with the National Government, is making China self-reliant and maintaining its rationality in the utilization of resources. Therefore, since last autumn, the Ministry of Greater East Asia has been at the center, contacting the National Government and studying its countermeasures. In mid-December of last year, after convening a liaison and discussion meeting in Tokyo with ambassadors and directors of offices from major embassies and offices in Zhangjiakou, Beijing, Shanghai, and Guangzhou, it was approved by the cabinet and established the so-called "New Economic Policy toward China". This policy was gradually clarified by Foreign Minister and Minister of Greater East Asia Shigemitsu in his replies to Mr. Tanaka Kou of the House of Representatives Budget Committee and Viscount Sakatani Kiichi and Baron Okura Koubou of the House of Peers Budget Committee.

The purpose of this policy is to overcome the difficulties of rebuilding China's economy, which is full of difficult problems, and to thoroughly implement the principles of the Sino-Japanese alliance treaty and the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration, to stabilize the people's livelihood in China, thereby seeking to strengthen and expand the National Government's political power, and to ensure comprehensive material and spiritual combat power. Only in this way can we open up the road for the Chinese economy, which occupies a very important position in the ties between China, Japan, and Manchukuo, to powerfully participate in the war. Therefore, the heads of the National Government, from Chairman Chen Dai onwards, have mobilized to command, and the Japanese central government has also dispatched specific persons in charge and liaisons from the relevant ministries, such as the Army, Navy, Ministry of Greater East Asia, and Ministry of Military Affairs, to implement this policy, communicate with each other, and take concerted action.

On the other hand, locally, the ambassador to China, the commander-in-chief of the general army, and the commander-in-chief of the dispatched fleet in China will set up the highest guidance agency, under which the directors of the major embassies and offices in Beijing, Zhangjiakou, Shanghai, and Guangzhou will be at the center, and local implementation agencies will be established with the participation of the local commanders of the army and navy. All the above agencies will be integrated to operate the policy. Among them, regarding the allocation of materials necessary to carry out the war, the steps of the forward agencies of the Army, Navy, and Ministry of Greater East Asia have been fully aligned and a new journey has begun. This is the finishing touch to the new policy and is highly anticipated.

The main points of the new economic policy towards China are as follows:

(1) To unify the local agencies of Japan in China, establish the three-in-one relationship mentioned above, and maintain the uniformity of various economic measures.

(2) To formulate a unified material allocation plan, taking into account the relationship with local people's needs during implementation, and maintain a reasonable balance between military and civilian needs.

(3) China's transportation capacity is greatly constrained by various aspects, which is a necessary phenomenon in wartime, but efforts must be made to maintain and cultivate it, and measures must be taken to maintain a balance between material allocation and transportation capacity, and to consider methods of mobilizing China's inherent transportation capacity, such as large sailing ships and motorized sailing ships.

(4) Although Japan will do its best to assist, all economic activities should be independently and autonomously conducted by the Chinese side, in accordance with the provisions of the alliance treaty, and the National Government's creativity and research are especially expected. To ensure the absolute necessary amount of coal, food, and other necessities of life for the Chinese side, thereby eliminating the problem of insufficient electricity, revitalizing the production of light industry, and thus arousing the will of the normal economic activities in various regions and enabling it to start automatic economic cycle activities.

(5) To protect the current currency system and absolutely maintain the exchange rate of 100 yuan of reserve notes to 18 yuan of Japanese gold. In addition, in order to recover currency to prevent malignant inflation, a groundbreaking method will be sought. The two governments of China and Japan are currently negotiating on this point.

(6) Regarding the mission of Japanese residents in China, a fundamental review will be made at this time, and the activities of Japanese-owned enterprises and national policy companies will be greatly reformed. (Translated from the Asahi Shimbun, February 7)

### Germany to Resume Submarine Warfare, Goebbels Broadcasts Determination to Win

Berlin, 1st (Central News Agency dispatch) - German News: German Propaganda Minister Goebbels broadcast to the German people on Wednesday evening, stating, "From a purely military perspective, the battle situation has changed suddenly due to the successful offensive of the Soviet forces from the Baranow bridgehead. Although our situation is currently very tense, it is not without hope. The misfortune suffered by the medical profession is indeed very painful, but it does not mean abandoning our determination to win. We have already built new defense lines on the Eastern Front. We are determined to recover the lost land. The war is not over, nor can it end like this. We will never give up our nation's right to survival, freedom, and future. We would rather die than surrender. Our military equipment and food potential have been greatly affected by the setbacks on the Eastern Front, but Germany can still continue to resist for an indefinite period. We must be more frugal than before and prepare to recover the lost land as soon as possible. To overcome the crisis, we must have the will to survive and not resign ourselves to fate. The enemy has also been repeatedly hit by our forces. Constant retaliatory weaponry has made the enemy find it unbearable and will greatly increase recently. German submarine warfare will also be resumed, on a scale unimaginable to the enemy. If we are resolute and unwavering, the enemy will never be able to defeat us. The enemy's camp is also not superior to ours. The Soviet Union estimates that its losses have exceeded 15 million people. This loss has a severe impact on the Soviet Union's chances in the war. The losses of the US military in this war have already doubled those of the last World War, and there is no hope of reducing them. As for Britain, it is not worth mentioning. Our nation is currently experiencing the most difficult test. I firmly believe that it will succeed. The tragedy of November 9, 1918, will never be repeated."

### Model Air-raid Shelter Groundbreaking Ceremony Held Yesterday, Mayor Zhou Sends Secretary-General Luo as Representative

The Civil Air Defense Headquarters will implement "Air-Raid Shelter Propaganda Week" starting yesterday (1st), arousing the public to build air-raid shelters in order to prepare for emergencies and protect the lives of citizens. In addition to publishing the significance of building air-raid shelters in newspapers and showing slides promoting air-raid shelters in various theaters, a groundbreaking ceremony was held at 10 am yesterday for the construction of a public model air-raid shelter within the Huangpu District on the Bund of Nanjing Road. Mayor Zhou sent Secretary-General Luo as his representative to break ground. Those present included Deputy Police Chief Watanabe Masaru, Chief Secretary of the Air Defense Headquarters Cao Jingang, Chief of General Affairs Noguchi, Chief of Fire Department Shimizu Kensui, Chief of Baojia Department Gu Wu, Police Chief Tsukazaki, Chief of Air Defense Section Yamamoto Shinichiro, Deputy Chief Li Zhenshi, and various district Baojia members such as Chen Fukang and Yu Xijing, district Lianbao chiefs and Baojia personnel, Huangpu District air defense police officers, Lianbao chiefs and famous Lianbao air defense Baojia personnel, totaling more than 200 people, presided over by Deputy Director Liu Yaying of the Huangpu Branch Bureau. The ceremony began on time. Deputy Director Liu gave an opening speech, and Secretary-General Luo, representing the Mayor, gave an instruction speech. Then, Secretary-General Luo performed the groundbreaking ceremony, which was completed immediately. The Baojia personnel of Huangpu District began work under the leadership of Deputy Director Liu.

Deputy Director Liu's Opening Speech

"Everyone, today is the day when the construction of the public model air-raid shelter begins in the jurisdiction of our branch bureau. I remember that on February 5th of this year, at 8 pm, the former Deputy Chief of the Second Division, Xue Zhiliang, already broadcast to you and all the citizens of Shanghai on Shanghai Radio, explaining the significance and importance of building air-raid shelters, and it was also reprinted in the newspapers the next day. I believe you have all heard about it. Today, I will add a few points. Once Shanghai suffers a major air raid and a large number of bombs fall, shrapnel is certainly enough to kill people, but the wind force generated by the explosion is also enough to cause death. Therefore, even if you are not hit by shrapnel, the inside of your body will inevitably be severely injured due to the high-speed wind force, and may even suffer a violent death. The clothes you are wearing will also be torn to shreds. At this time, those standing on the ground can immediately fall to the ground to reduce the degree of injury, but it is much more dangerous than hiding in an air-raid shelter. Entering the air-raid shelter, except for being directly hit, can be said to be the safest place to take refuge, and the chance of being directly hit is very small. Since the Mayor took office, he has been extraordinarily concerned about the safety of citizens, so he specially initiated the Air-Raid Shelter Construction Week, hoping that citizens will rise up together and strive to build air-raid shelters, using their own strength to protect themselves, in order to avoid the dangers caused by air raids in the future. This is the meaning of the beginning of construction in the jurisdiction of our branch bureau today. At the same time, in order to arouse the attention of all citizens, and the importance of this construction, we especially respectfully invite the Mayor to preside over the groundbreaking ceremony. The Mayor was unable to attend due to official duties, and Secretary-General Luo is representing him. I pray that all air defense members and citizens will, under the leadership of the Mayor, quickly complete this work of great significance. Finally, I would also like to express my gratitude on behalf of the citizens of Huangpu District to the Shanghai Special City Rattan and Willow Trade Association and its Chairman, Mr. Huang Zhuan, because the bamboo materials for building the air-raid shelter were donated by the association."

Mayor's Instruction Speech

Secretary-General Luo, representing Mayor Zhou, then gave an instruction speech, roughly stating: "Everyone: Today, in my capacity as the Secretary-General of the Municipal Government, I am representing the Mayor here to hold the groundbreaking ceremony for the model air-raid shelter, and I would like to say a few simple words. In the current situation of the increasingly tense war, every Chinese person must have the determination to calmly face the war. Building air-raid shelters is also a way to cope with the determination of the war, and its importance has been repeatedly stated by the air defense authorities and myself. We must be prepared for emergencies, and with sufficient preparation, we can reduce damage. The meaning of this is clearly understood by every citizen. The Baojia personnel of this city have all received rigorous training and are very familiar with air defense measures, and they are all enthusiastic and work hard, and have already achieved considerable results. I hope that they will continue to work hard on air defense and contribute everything to protect the safety of Greater Shanghai."

### "Condor Anthem" to be Performed Tomorrow

The Shanghai Branch of the China News Association, in order to promote the great achievements of Allied aviation warriors, specifically solicited lyrics for the "Condor Anthem" publicly.

### City School People's Education Center Employees to Receive Free Rice

Regarding the matter of key rice allocation of 3 dou per month for employees of municipal schools and people's education centers, free allocation has been approved starting in February. However, because the allocation certificates for February have already been distributed and are the same style as general allocation certificates, it is difficult to distinguish whether they are exempt or not. Starting in March, the rice allocation certificates for employees of municipal schools and centers will be designed in a different style to distinguish them from other allocation certificates. The price will still be temporarily paid as usual for the rice received in March. After the allocation is completed, each school and center will prepare three copies of the employee list and submit them to the Education Bureau for review by the Municipal Government, and the original rice payment will be collected and returned to the employees of each school and center. The City Education Bureau has ordered the schools and centers to comply.
