### Imperial Tour of Northern Jiangsu to Express Concern for the People's Suffering; Acting Chairman Chen Summoned Military and Political Leaders in Yangzhou and Taizhou Yesterday for Instructions After Returning to Nanjing

Nanjing, 29th (Central News Agency dispatch) - With Northern Jiangsu being a crucial area for anti-communist efforts, Acting Chairman Chen of the National Government is deeply concerned about the military and political situation and the hardships of the people there. He departed from Nanjing on the 28th of this month for an inspection tour of the area. Accompanying him were Cen Deguang, Secretary-General of the Central Political Council; Zhou Longxiang, Director of the Adjutant's Office; Lu Ying, Chief Aide-de-Camp; Guo Xiufeng, Secretary-General of the Central Political Council; Lin Ji, Senior Adjutant; He Junliang, and others, as well as Major General Asakai, the Supreme Military Advisor from the Allied Nations. He arrived in Yangzhou at noon that day, where he summoned senior officials of the Northern Jiangsu Pacification Headquarters and generals of the Second War Area for instructions. In the evening, he arrived in Taizhou and stayed there. On the morning of the 29th, he inspected the troops and gave instructions, earnestly lecturing on the two major domestic and foreign policies of realizing unification through anti-communism and striving for independence and liberation through participation in the war. All officers and soldiers who heard this were greatly inspired. He returned to Yangzhou on the same day at noon and safely returned to the capital at 4:30 PM. The details are as follows:

Inspection of Yangzhou

At approximately 8:00 AM on the 28th, Acting Chairman Chen departed from Xiaguan by car amidst heavy rain to Yangzhou. Dozens of people accompanied him. When he departed, all senior officials of the central government were present at the station to see him off. At 10:30 AM, the car arrived in Zhenjiang, where Sun Liangcheng, Director of the Northern Jiangsu Pacification, led senior officials at the station to respectfully welcome the Chairman. They then boarded pre-arranged cars and drove to the pier. Along the road from the station to the pier, military police, officials, students, and civilians stood to greet and pay their respects. At 10:45 AM, they boarded a special ferry to cross the river. The weather was clear that day, and the water was calm. At 11:30 AM, they safely arrived at Liuwei on the northern bank of the Yangtze River, where officials and representatives of the people from Yangzhou had already gathered to welcome them. The Chairman disembarked and boarded a car, led by guards, followed by others in military vehicles in an orderly fashion. After traveling over 20 li, they arrived at the city and entered through the Victory Arch. Inside and outside the city gate, more than 10,000 civilians and students stood along both sides of the avenue, holding flags and shouting slogans of support. Flags were hung along the route, and slogans were posted, including "Support Acting Chairman Chen to implement the national policy of peace, anti-communism, and national reconstruction," "Support Acting Chairman Chen to eliminate the evil communists," and "Support Acting Chairman Chen to relieve the suffering of the people of Northern Jiangsu." After the motorcade entered the city, it went to the government office to rest briefly. At 12:30 PM, a meeting was convened for instructions for party and government officials.

Main Points of the Instructions

First, he explained the purpose of his visit to Northern Jiangsu, which was to understand the actual situation of suppressing the communists in Northern Jiangsu and whether the military and political facilities were in line with the needs of the current situation. The other purpose was to declare that the central government's national policy of peace, anti-communism, and national reconstruction remains unchanged, encouraging the generals to strengthen their beliefs, trust the central government, and cooperate with the national policy. He then laid out two tasks for the next two days. The first was to intensify anti-communist efforts, because the Nationalists and Communists cannot coexist. The existence of the Communist Party not only endangers the Kuomintang but also hinders the survival of the country and the nation. Northern Jiangsu is a place where the communists have entrenched themselves, and we should intensify our efforts to eliminate them to eradicate their remaining forces. The second was the issue of participating in the Greater East Asia War. China's participation in the war was originally voluntary, not an opportunistic move. Furthermore, opposing Anglo-American imperialism is the legacy of the Founding Father. While striving for China's independence and freedom, we should also strive for freedom and equality for the nations of East Asia. At this point, he recounted the oppression suffered by East Asia from Anglo-American imperialists over the past century and explained the inside story of the San Francisco Conference and the ambitions of Britain and the United States. China's participation in the war has always been a consistent policy of our country's revolution against aggression, and success or failure is not a consideration. Finally, he clarified the world situation with profound meaning. The instructions lasted for 30 minutes. After the instructions, Director Sun led the shouting of slogans, and then everyone went to the government office to rest. At 1:00 PM, Director Sun of the Pacification hosted a banquet at the Yangzhou Society Restaurant and invited Allied generals to accompany them. During the banquet, Director Sun presented a speech to the Chairman, stating that Northern Jiangsu was determined to sincerely support the central government and expressing their determination to oppose communism. The Chairman gave instructions, encouraging the generals to fight for anti-communist efforts. All the attendees were greatly inspired. The banquet ended at around 2:00 PM.

Military Review in Taixian

At 3:30 PM, he departed by car for Taizhou. The Yangzhou-Taizhou highway was a total of 70 li, and the journey took about 2 hours. Along the way, the fields were fertile for thousands of li, and pillboxes could be seen scattered around, indicating the solid defenses of the area. Since the outbreak of the incident, the communists had taken the opportunity to rise up and spread throughout Northern Jiangsu, and the people suffered greatly. Now, under the efforts of the Pacification Headquarters and the Second War Area, the communists are becoming less and less visible, shattering the communists' earlier boast of making Northern Jiangsu a "second Yan'an," leaving them scattered and fleeing. The Chairman praised this greatly. At 6:00 PM, he arrived in Taixian, where all senior generals of the Second War Area, including Sun as the concurrently-serving Commander-in-Chief, local officials, students, and Allied military personnel, stood along the road to welcome him, holding banners and shouting slogans, similar to what was seen in Yangzhou. At 6:05 PM, he arrived at the government office to rest and then summoned senior generals of the Second War Area to listen to their reports and give instructions. At 8:00 PM, a dinner was held. The Chairman earnestly expressed his concern that the imperial tour would cost the local area too much and encouraged Commander-in-Chief Sun to cherish material resources and avoid extravagance. Commander-in-Chief Sun listened attentively. The banquet ended at around 9:00 PM, and at 10:00 PM, everyone rested. A heavy rain began in the evening and did not stop all night. At 7:30 AM on the 29th, he went to review the troops. At that time, the heavy rain had just stopped, and the field was muddy, but the soldiers were in high spirits. Sun Yutian, Commander of the 38th Division, served as the commander, and the three regiments being reviewed were well-equipped. First, the Chairman was invited to inspect the field for a week, and then soldiers from each platoon performed drills, including bayonet training and boxing, which were all very exciting. After the drills were completed, the Chairman was invited to give instructions. (The main points of the instructions were the same as those given in Yangzhou and will not be recorded separately.) Finally, Commander-in-Chief Sun led the shouting of slogans, and the sounds of "Support Acting Chairman Chen," "Support the national policy of peace, anti-communism, and national reconstruction," "Long live the Chairman," and "Long live the Republic of China" were deafening. From this, it can be seen that the local people sincerely support the central government and Acting Chairman Chen.

Return to Nanjing

At 9:30 AM, he departed for Yangzhou. The people of that area, hoping for good harvests due to the heavy rain the night before, were overjoyed that the rain had come with the Chairman. Northern Jiangsu had been suffering from a prolonged drought, and after this heavy rain, agricultural prospects were promising, and the farmers were ecstatic, and not without reason. After the motorcade left Taixian city, as soon as it entered the Yangzhou-Taizhou highway, accumulated water was seen everywhere, making it difficult for the cars to travel. However, the Chairman did not suffer from the hardships of the journey but instead often showed a happy expression. The great personality of the leader was deeply moving. At 12:30 PM, the car arrived in Yangzhou. At 12:30 PM, lunch was served. At 1:30 PM, he left Yangzhou and transferred to a special ferry at Liuwei to cross the river. At 2:50 PM, he arrived in Zhenjiang. At around 3:00 PM, he arrived at the station, and the train departed at 3:19 PM. At 4:30 PM, he safely arrived in the capital. Along the way, military officers and civilians from each area respectfully saw him off as before. Upon arriving in Nanjing, he was welcomed by senior officials of the central government and returned to his official residence to rest.

### Japanese Air Force Surprise Attack on Enemy Fleet off Balikpapan; Achieving Great Results with Dispersed Tactics

Southern Frontline Base, 29th (Central News Agency dispatch) - The 7th Squadron of the new Japanese Air Force, in order to annihilate the enemy's powerful fleet off Balikpapan, departed from the base on the evening of the 25th and launched a fierce surprise attack on the enemy fleet cruising about 40 kilometers east of Balikpapan. Braving intense anti-aircraft fire, the Japanese planes advanced to the skies above the enemy fleet and launched torpedo attacks one after another. So far, the confirmed results are the sinking of one large cruiser, three or more cruisers or destroyers, and one or more oil tankers. The enemy fleet attacked by the 7th Squadron was a powerful enemy naval force composed of three large cruisers, four large destroyers, and four small destroyers. The enemy minesweeper group had anchored 40 kilometers east of Balikpapan on the night of the 25th, forming a circular formation, and the 7th Squadron was able to achieve such great results by adopting dispersed surprise attack tactics. In addition, large fires were confirmed among the enemy fleet.

Southwest Pacific Base, 29th (Central News Agency dispatch) - The enemy fleet off Balikpapan, which was heavily damaged by a surprise torpedo attack by the Japanese on the 25th, is actively increasing its strength, and its actions appear extremely cautious. In addition to dispatching B24, B25, and P38 aircraft to fly over Japanese positions, it has also deployed minesweepers, submarine chasers, destroyers, and cruisers to carry out intense shelling, covering landing craft near the coastline and closely reconnoitering Japanese positions. On the 27th, enemy warships moved on the sea, including five heavy cruisers, three light cruisers, ten destroyers, more than twenty minesweepers and destroyer escorts, three oil tankers, and several transport ships. In addition, the number of landing craft had also increased compared to the previous day. Behind them, a ship resembling a seaplane carrier was cruising. The enemy's landing attempt in Balikpapan has become increasingly blatant.

### Lieutenant General Ushijima and Others Commit Seppuku

Tokyo, 29th (Central News Agency dispatch) - Lieutenant General Mitsuru Ushijima, the supreme commander of the Japanese forces in Okinawa, and Major General Isamu Cho, the chief of staff of that unit, committed seppuku after the final general offensive. This was confirmed by the enemy's announcement on the 27th. According to a San Francisco broadcast at 5:00 PM on the 27th, the details of the two generals' suicide were as follows: the bodies of Lieutenant General Ushijima, the supreme commander of the Japanese forces in Okinawa, and his chief of staff, were found under a stone tomb on the southwest coast of Okinawa. Both were wearing military uniforms, and their abdomens had been cut with cross-shaped wounds.

Editorial

### Contradictions between the United States and the Chongqing Government with the Communists

Yesterday, newspapers published news of the Chinese Communist Party's criticism of the United States' policy of containment towards China, which is sufficient to illustrate the triangular contradictions between the Chongqing government with the Communists, and between the United States and the Chongqing government with the Communists.

Why did the Communist Party initially encourage the Nationalist Party to unite in resistance against Japan? It was because the Communist Party wanted to take advantage of the war of resistance to expand its own power and, further, to eliminate the power of the Nationalist Party and seize political power. The Communist Party's motives were impure. Why did the United States want to use Chongqing and the Chinese Communist Party simultaneously to fight Japan? Standing from the position of capitalist imperialism, the United States has always attempted to seize the entire Chinese market in order to dump its goods and achieve its goals of economic aggression. Because it wants to dominate the entire Chinese market, it simultaneously makes the domestic forces in China weaken each other, reducing their independent strength, and uses seductive means to exclude other foreign forces. This position of American capitalist imperialism was obvious before the Sino-Japanese Incident and has become even more active since the incident. Therefore, the motives of the United States are also impure.

Starting from these two impure motives, cooperation between the two sides will certainly not last long, and contradictions will inevitably arise in the process of so-called "cooperation." Therefore, American assistance to the Chinese Communist Party is not absolute. The fact that the United States has two lines of policy toward China is very clear.

What we must pay attention to here is how to see through the consistent plan of the United States toward China in the two opposing lines of the United States toward China. Why did the United States adopt two policies? Very clearly, Chongqing is dissatisfied with the United States' sympathetic attitude toward the Chinese Communist Party, and the Chinese Communist Party is also dissatisfied with the United States' helping Chongqing with most of its power. The Stilwell line and the Hurley line grasp only the superficial divergence in American views on Chinese policy. In fact, the United States has always had a consistent policy toward China in the past, present, and even in the future.

The cause of the Sino-Japanese Incident. When we look at the demands put forward by Stilwell, such as the "unification of Chinese anti-Japanese forces," the "lifting of Chongqing's blockade against the Chinese Communist Party, and the transfer of the blockading troops to the front lines," and "the United States' necessity to supply the Chinese Communist Party's troops with the minimum amount of necessary weapons," they are sufficient to fully demonstrate the ambitions of the United States!

The so-called Hurley line is to recognize Chongqing as orthodox, which is a consistent approach of the United States since the incident. At the same time, it can also explain the combination of Chongqing and American forces. Because many of those in the Chongqing regime who call themselves the American faction have achieved considerable status in politics and formed considerable power, which the Chinese Communist Party cannot match. However, because the United States' motives for its policy toward China are impure, although it is very concerned about the friction between Chongqing and the Communists, it does not have the absolute determination and power to reconcile them.

In short, what we should recognize at this time and place is that the purpose of the United States' policy toward China is to obtain a priority market after the war. It does not want China to be unified, nor does it want China to be able to be independent and autonomous. It not only attempts to use the power of both Chongqing and the Communists to consume Japan's military power, but also to consume China's entire vitality. Due to this observation, the United States uses both Chongqing and the Communists, while the Chinese Communist Party is unwilling to be completely used by the United States, and Chongqing cannot get rid of the United States' shackles, forming a fragmented situation. In this contradictory situation between Chongqing and the Communists and between the United States and the two, we, standing from the position of the people, naturally need to open up an autonomous path. Therefore, "peace, anti-communism, and national reconstruction" is the national policy of the National Government, which we believe is theoretically correct and appropriate. However, because the political power is insufficient, it cannot oppose communism, nor can it achieve comprehensive peace. Therefore, the path of the people's autonomy cannot be actively opened up. However, how to open up the path of the people's autonomy is undoubtedly the most distressing problem we feel today.

### B-29 Enemy Aircraft Attack the Kanmon Area, etc.; Minor Damage to Important Japanese Facilities

Fukuoka, 29th (Central News Agency dispatch) - Approximately 20 B-29 aircraft from the Mariana base invaded the Kanmon area around 11:30 PM on the 28th and escaped after carrying out incendiary bomb attacks on both cities. Another approximately 30 B-29 aircraft invaded the Kagoshima area at 11:50 PM and escaped through Saga, Omura, Miyazaki, and Kumamoto areas after carrying out incendiary bomb attacks on Sasebo city. Incendiary bombs were dropped in parts of Kumamoto and Kagoshima prefectures. Subsequently, at around 3:00 AM on the 29th, several B-29 aircraft invaded near Nobeoka, Miyazaki Prefecture, and dropped incendiary bombs. Fires broke out in various places in Moji, Shimonoseki, and Sasebo cities. They were quickly extinguished after the military and civilians fought bravely with fire prevention teams. Japanese important facilities suffered minor damage.

Okayama, 29th (Central News Agency dispatch) - More than 30 enemy B-29 aircraft from the Southern Base invaded near Okayama through the Kii Channel at 2:00 AM on the 29th, dropped incendiary bombs, and then escaped south through the eastern part of Shien. The fire that occurred in Okayama City was completely extinguished by dawn. In addition, several B-29 aircraft invaded through the Bungo Channel at just after midnight on the same day and retreated after dropping incendiary bombs near Kanmon.

### Senate Established in Sumatra

Sumatra Base, 29th (Central News Agency dispatch) - The opening ceremony of the Central Senate of Sumatra was solemnly held in the Great Assembly Hall of the Senate yesterday morning at 10:00 AM. After reading the instructions of the Japanese Supreme Commander and congratulatory and encouraging telegrams from Prime Minister Suzuki and Minister of the Army Anami, Chairman Shafi took the oath first, expressing the strong faith of the East Indian Indonesian nation. The ceremony ended at 11:30 AM. Then, the first day's agenda was carried out, and the resolution to strive to complete the holy war was unanimously passed.

### Japanese Light Balloon Mines Threaten Canada

Lisbon, 29th (Central News Agency dispatch) - According to Ottawa Radio's broadcast yesterday, Japanese light balloons and mines are now continuously threatening the western ports of Canada. Furthermore, Washington recently acknowledged that the damage caused by Japanese light balloons in the Pacific Ocean to the United States was quite severe.

### US Strengthens Economic Control over Chongqing

Central News Agency, Shanghai - The power of the United States to dominate Chongqing is gradually increasing, and all those who care about China's future are deeply worried. A Chongqing dispatch on June 26 broadcast an article titled "On the US Military Headquarters in the China Theater." The article, based on reports obtained from the US Military Headquarters in the China Theater, discussed the power of the headquarters to dominate China's production plans, currency, and finance, boastfully exaggerating the United States' power to dominate Chongqing. The article stated, "The US Military Headquarters in the China Theater also cooperates with the administration of areas occupied by the Chongqing military's offensive forces, integrating the Chinese economy with operations and establishing a more modern new organization." The organization and tasks of the so-called "G-5 Bureau" under the headquarters were reported. The so-called G-5 Bureau, located in Chongqing, is called the "nerve center whose activities affect any military action in China." It is divided into six departments: military supplies and distribution, production, purchasing, civilian economy, military government, and confidential. Its tasks are sixfold. First, "determining matters related to the lending of military supplies to China." Second, "developing China's industry to rapidly supply all military needs within China." Third, "purchasing materials and resolving China's taxation problems." Fourth, "controlling currency and prices." Fifth, "reviewing the suggestions of American advisors to various plans of the Chongqing government and transmitting them to the Chongqing government, and studying administrative plans for newly occupied areas." Sixth, "military liaison." Observing the organization and tasks of the G-5 Bureau, it is clear that based on the needs of the United States to promote its operational plans, it actively extends its power to the political and economic policies of the Chongqing side. In other words, economic policies such as China's industrial development issues and currency and price issues, and all kinds of policies of the Chongqing side, are currently being controlled and managed by the US Military Headquarters. It is not yet clear what kind of relationship and connection the above-mentioned G-5 Bureau has with the various agencies of the Chongqing side. However, the American domination of Chongqing, under the beautiful name of promoting Chongqing's "modernization," is gradually becoming stronger and more blatant, clearly exceeding the limits of current war necessities, and is gradually developing into the complete colonization of Chongqing by American monetary imperialism.

It has now ordered various counties to effectively use the strength of the Baojia system to reclaim wasteland and develop water conservancy in order to jointly increase agricultural production. It is currently being actively promoted. Other measures such as preventing locusts and improving silkworm seeds have also been started. It is expected that the Baojia system in the province today will exert great effects.

### Radio Listening Fees Adjusted in Various Places

Nanjing, 29th (Central News Agency dispatch) - The radio listening fee in various regions of Central China was originally uniformly set at 300 yuan per month for each set.

### 江南 Impressions

— Lan Yu

Concerning the Xiantian Dao (Way of Former Heaven)

When reporters arrived in Wuxi

When the reporters arrived in Wuxi, they interviewed three different groups regarding the Xiantian Dao: military and police authorities, intellectuals, and ordinary citizens. The intellectuals were the most moderate. Their criticism was that the Xiantian Dao's divine pronouncements and bizarre tales were absurd, but the Xiantian Dao had its own background for growth. The targets of the Xiantian Dao's resistance were tax officials, township and village chiefs, local bullies, etc. The composition of the Xiantian Dao was mostly farmers. If the farmers had no grievances or hatred with these people, they would definitely not resort to weapons. Therefore, to pacify the Xiantian Dao, one must start by eradicating corruption.

Some asked: What about the main criminal of the Xiantian Dao, Ni Zicai? In the reporter's view, his appearance is ordinary, and his conversation is unremarkable, honest, and courteous. Seeing someone so ordinary, one would not believe he committed such actions. Some said: "Some surprising actions are often done by ordinary, honest people."

Township Office's Method of Extortion

There is a district with twenty townships, each of which must pay 200,000 yuan monthly to their superiors.

The expenses of a certain township office are several times greater than those of the county government. The responsible persons of the township offices are mostly involved with multiple powers. The busiest work of the township office is dealing with these multiple powers. The reason for the township office's huge expenses is this busiest work.

The bad method of the township office to extort money is to use various names to raise supply fees. If the villagers resist, there are ways to deal with them at any time, arresting and severely torturing them.

When bandits come to the countryside, the villagers dare not report them. On the one hand, the bandits know and would kill them. At the same time, the result of reporting still leads to the loss of cigarettes, alcohol, firewood, and rice.

A Glimpse of Farmers' Suffering

In the Wuxi countryside, there is the saying "poking the chamber pot." "Poking the chamber pot" refers to armed personnel, knowing that farmers like to hide gold and silver jewelry in chamber pots. Therefore, in groups of three or five, they often go to farmers' homes, finding chamber pots in corners and remote places. Once found, anything inverted or sealed is broken open at the bottom with wooden sticks to see what is inside.

In the countryside, there is no large-scale business. Here is an example: "Someone returned to their hometown and opened an oil shop in the countryside. After opening, the business was quite prosperous, but the supply fees were enormous. The monthly income only covered expenses. After the second month, several uninvited guests came to the shop, looking for the owner to split shares. The shop was originally a sole proprietorship. The owner argued with them. They took out shares with the same name as the shop's license and threatened the owner sternly, claiming that if they did not split shares, they would go to the troop headquarters to reason. As a result, someone was asked to intercede, and after repeatedly pleading, the matter was settled with 600,000 yuan."

Unexpectedly, less than half a month later, the matter was heard by another party, and they came in a different way. Several armed people came, claiming that the shop's operation was improper. They kidnapped the owner and took him away. Then, after another round of crying and pleading, it was settled with 500,000 yuan. After these two blows, the shop owner quickly closed the shop and moved back to the city. As a result, most of the capital was lost.

Setting up checkpoints along the way seems to have become an open way for some military and police to make money. In one county, importing goods from the Yangtze River, just a few miles, there are thirteen checkpoints. A small boat needs to pay 2,000 yuan at each checkpoint. From the city to Suzhou, there are about 160 checkpoints, each requiring a similar amount. However, the above only refers to empty boats. If loaded with goods, it depends on the value of the goods and the payer's capability.

Prisoners and Others

Seeing the general situation of a certain county's administration: "The county's prison is dilapidated, the facilities are crude, it is difficult to avoid wind and rain in winter, and it affects hygiene in summer... The food ration for each prisoner is stipulated at 20 yuan per day, but in fact, it is far from enough. The government has to issue rice by name..." From the sentence "affects hygiene in summer," one can still imagine why former Minister of Justice Zhang passed away.

Many posters urging people to pay taxes are pasted in the tea houses and restaurants of Jiangyin. Here are a few examples, which show the difficulty of persuading people to pay taxes: "Paying grain taxes is a national duty," "Paying early is an honor, paying late is a shame," "Grain households should choose top-quality rice for paying taxes," "Mixing water and bad grain to pay taxes is a rogue."

### Mother Zhou, Madam Ma, Passed Away in Guiyang　Mayor Zhou Resigns from All Concurrent Positions

Mayor of Shanghai Zhou Fohai lost his father early and was raised and educated by his mother, Madam Ma, until adulthood. Over the years, Zhou has been running around for national affairs and could not take care of his mother. Yesterday morning, the news came that Madam Ma passed away in Guiyang on the 25th of this month. Zhou was extremely saddened upon hearing the news. He sent a telegram to Chairman Chen, requesting to resign from all concurrent positions so that he could fulfill his filial duties. The original telegram is recorded as follows:

To Brother Chen Gongbo, Acting Chairman in Nanjing: I have just learned that my mother, Madam Ma, passed away on June 25th in Guiyang. I have long neglected my duties to visit and care for her, and my guilt is profound. I have not personally tasted her medicine or attended to her funeral arrangements. The sudden news has left me unable to rush home. I beg to resign from all my positions, so that I may somewhat alleviate my spiritual guilt. I await your urgent orders. Your brother, Zhou Fohai, respectfully bows.

### The Economic Foundation of the British Empire is Shaken

Central News Agency, Stockholm, 29th – According to a London dispatch: In this war, Britain has not only lost all its overseas investments of one billion pounds, but also incurred foreign debts of 2.3 billion pounds, becoming a debtor nation. Therefore, the only way for it to seek to overcome this economic crisis is to extract wealth from its autonomous nations in the name of the British Empire. However, in the last year or two, the anti-British sentiment in the autonomous nations has been increasing, fundamentally shaking Britain. On June 2nd, the famous British economist Professor Fischer gave a speech to a group of industrialists at the Chatham Hotel, predicting the collapse of the British Empire and the reasons for its isolation, causing anxiety among the audience. The main points of his speech were roughly as follows: Those who expect something from the British Empire will suffer deep disillusionment and sorrow. The autonomous nations themselves do not have economic concepts that align with Britain's current interests for their future. The autonomous nations believe that establishing trade relations outside the Commonwealth is a necessary condition for their future economic prosperity. For example, Canada's ideal is to eliminate world trade barriers and engage in free trade. The Canadian economic community believes that close cooperation with the United States can obtain a large inflow of American goods. However, before this debt is repaid, not only can this exclusive British Empire group not be tolerated, but the attitude of the South African Federation towards the British Empire is also very indifferent. This is because its benefits of free trade with the world are far greater than those of Canada. Australian public opinion believes that the United States is the buyer of Australian meat, wheat, wool, etc., so the United States is a powerful force dominating the Australian economy. On the one hand, when Britain cannot realize its security guarantee organization, Australia may transform into a nation that is self-sufficient and extremely developed in industry. The situation in New Zealand is similar to that in Australia. As for India, it has a tendency towards isolationism.

### B24 Aircraft Factory Closed

### Byrnes May Succeed as US Secretary of State

Central News Agency, Lisbon, 29th – According to the Washington Post: Former US Mobilization Director James Byrnes is said to be likely to succeed Stettinius as US Secretary of State.

### Indian National Congress Gives Azad Full Power　Carefully Reviews New British Proposals

Central News Agency, Lisbon, 29th – According to a Reuters correspondent in Simla: After the Simla Conference tentatively concluded on the 26th, it was extended for four more days. During this time, representatives of various factions negotiated on the conclusion, and the opinions of the representatives on the detailed content of the British proposal seemed to be very different. Azad, a representative of the Congress Party, made a statement on this fact on the 28th, saying, "The Executive Committee of the Congress Party has given me the power to take necessary measures on the various issues that arise in this parliament. Therefore, it is my duty to carefully review the detailed content of the new proposal and consider countermeasures. When the details of the new proposal are fully determined, I will present a formal proposal to the Governor-General to decide on the final measures, but this stage has not yet been reached."

Central News Agency, Stockholm, 29th – According to information arriving from the area: Cologne, under US military administration, experienced political turmoil on June 20th. Although the details are still unclear, it is said to be due to the issue of German education and the inappropriate measures taken by the authorities. More than 5,000 Germans staged a demonstration near the Cologne City Hall, and the US military immediately opened fire to disperse the assembled crowd.

### List of Cabinet Members of the Polish Unified Government

Central News Agency, Stockholm, 29th – According to the Polish radio broadcast last night: Former Prime Minister Morawski of the Lublin government of Poland has reorganized a new Polish unified government, and the list of cabinet members has been announced as follows:

Prime Minister Morawski, Deputy Prime Minister Gomulka, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Agriculture Mikolajczyk, Minister of National Defense Rola-Zymierski, Foreign Minister Rzymowski, Minister of Public Administration Kiernik, Minister of Public Security Radkiewicz, Minister of Finance Dombrowski, Minister of Industry Minc, Minister of Transportation Rapacki, Minister of Posts and Telecommunications Sugierda, Minister of Shipping and Foreign Trade Jodlkowski, Minister of Health and Welfare Litwin, Minister of Labor and Social Welfare Stanczyk, Minister of Culture and Art Kowalski, Minister of Construction Kaczorowski, Minister of Information Modzelewski, Minister of Justice Drobinski, Minister of Education Wycech, Minister of Agriculture and Forestry Tkaczow.

Key to Solving Fundamental Problems

Central News Agency News – According to a Reuters diplomatic correspondent on the 28th: As a result of the recent Moscow Conference, it was decided to establish a Polish unified government in Warsaw. Regarding this, two fundamental problems have arisen: One is to recognize Moscow's sincerity, and the other is to guarantee that free elections will be allowed in Poland. The attitude of the Polish regime in London towards this situation is noteworthy. According to the latest documents issued by the regime, it reveals considerable distrust of the Soviet Union's sincerity. Regarding so-called free elections, the regime's view is that free and fair elections are absolutely impossible as long as Soviet troops and political police are stationed in Polish territory and political life is not free. In short, the key figures in the new Polish government believe that the Soviet Union sincerely wishes to establish friendly relations with Poland. Conversely, the Polish regime in London holds the traditional Polish suspicion. Therefore, the key to solving the problem lies in whether the above two opposing attitudes can be reconciled.

### Soviet Union Hopes to Conclude a Treaty of Friendship with Turkey

Central News Agency, Stockholm, 29th – According to Reuters military interviewer Kish: Regarding the issue of future management of the Dardanelles Strait, the matter will be brought up for discussion at the Three-Power Conference, which now seems to have been confirmed. As for the nature of the opinions exchanged between the Soviet Union and the Turkish government regarding the management of the Dardanelles Strait, there is currently no official information. However, it is generally believed that the exchange of opinions only involved the conflict in Syria and the urgent situation in the Levant. The Soviet government now hopes to re-sign a treaty of friendship and mutual assistance with the Turkish government. This will make the Dardanelles Strait Management Regulations stipulated in the former Montreux Conference a mere formality. The Soviet proposal is nothing more than to prohibit foreign warships from entering the Dardanelles Strait, and only the Soviet Union and Turkey can freely navigate in the strait. Therefore, the Soviet government has recently proposed to the Turkish government to establish a joint base to protect the Dardanelles Strait and the Aegean Sea. What is currently causing anxiety for the Turkish authorities is the Soviet Union's demand for greater democratization of the Turkish government.

### France Uncovers a Major Conspiracy in Arabia

Central News Agency, Zurich, 29th – A major conspiracy to use Arabs to collectively rebel in Algiers on July 1st was fortunately discovered in advance. Several masterminds have been arrested by French judicial officers, and many weapons and gunpowder have been seized. According to the steps of the conspiracy, the first step was to incite the Arabs to establish their provisional regime to fight against France, and then request a third country to mediate, forcing France to make concessions, which is exactly the same as the situation in the Levant. The initiator seems to be Britain.

### Seven Major Disputes in Europe

Aftonbladet reports that after the Soviet army occupied Bornholm and Ertholmene (small Danish islands in the southern Baltic Sea off Sweden), it is bound to cause a seventh dispute in Europe in addition to the following six issues. The so-called six major problems in Europe are: the Polish issue; the Polish Kronkford and Oder River basin management issue; the Austrian pro-Soviet regime issue; the occupation of the Lithuanian coast; Tito's regime's demand for Trieste; Greece's demand for the return of Rhodes. Regarding this matter, the Daily Mail said: "The reason for these disputes lies in the attempt of various countries to establish their own sphere of influence and to include these regions within their own borders. Therefore, the above issues are unlikely to be resolved even in the peace conference. The only way to deal with this situation is to seek a legitimate solution with a calm and firm attitude. This is the policy adopted by Britain and the United States and has the right to require the Soviet Union to provide full support." This is a subtle warning to Britain and the Soviet Union. Another Manchester newspaper hinted that it would be best for the Soviet Union not to station troops in Bornholm for a long time. It said: "Bornholm is a strategically important island, and Denmark is a liberated country, not an occupied country. This point must be remembered. The British people hope that the Soviet army will withdraw from the island as soon as the military situation permits."

Aftonbladet reported a Copenhagen telegram that Soviet troops were constantly arriving in Bornholm, and it seemed that they intended to stay on the island for a long time. However, there are almost no remnants of the German army on Bornholm today. The Soviet army's job is only to collect the ammunition and weapons abandoned by the German army and send them to the rear. A Red Army major general, who is a member of the Soviet People's Commissariat of Internal Affairs, arrived in Bornholm and negotiated with the local police. As a result, after 17:20 on the 15th, the island's telecommunications and telephone connections with the outside world were stopped. A postal plane that arrived on Bornholm Island at 11:00 on the 15th, which should have loaded local mail and flew away from the island in the afternoon, was also prevented. Regarding this matter, a statement of reasons was requested from the authorities, but it was not allowed. However, this incident did not occur because of any other unexpected changes, purely due to the intention of the local military authorities.

According to intelligence, there are 5,000 Soviet armored vehicle units and artillery on the island, and it is rumored that it will increase to 14,000 people. (Stockholm, 17th – Translated from Asahi Shimbun)

### Central Reserve Bank Increases the Amount of Cash for All Banks and Money Shops　Customers Should Be Paid in Cash as Much as Possible and No Detention Is Allowed

In recent ten days, the evil trend of discount on transfer orders in this city has become increasingly rampant, to the point of affecting the stability of the entire finance. The Central Reserve Bank is paying close attention to this. After the Financial Affairs Inspection Office checked the accounts of the financial institutions, not only were the actual discount evidences for transfer orders discovered, but also the practice of developing bad cheques discovered. Therefore, the authorities consider it imperative to fundamentally cancel the development of transfer orders. After convening the Silver and Money Industries Association to discuss the matter, it was decided that from July 3, all banks and money shops will stop developing transfer orders from the Central Reserve Bank and the Silver Union Agricultural Money Reserve. For customer deposits and withdrawals, in addition to cash, parallel-lined checks will be used for payment.

Central Reserve Bank's Solution for Cash

As for the issue of cash needed by various banks and money shops after the cancellation of transfer orders, Qian Daji, Vice President of the Central Reserve Bank, has agreed to the request of the responsible person of the Silver and Money Industries Association. All cash needed for the salaries of the staff of the Silver and Money Industries Association member banks and money shops and all expenses will be prepared by each bank and money shop, sent to the Central Reserve Bank for review, and then paid in special cash. For the cash to be paid to customers for withdrawals, the amount of cash will be increased according to the standard of the deposit amount of each bank and money shop. Each bank and money shop should pay customers in cash as much as possible every day, and should not accumulate cash, so as to avoid the accumulation under the pretext, and secretly breeding the evils of discount.

Central Reserve Bank's Circular on Canceling Transfer Orders

The Central Reserve Bank issued a circular to cancel the transfer orders of sixty exchange banks, stating: "The checks (that is, transfer orders) previously issued to various exchange banks by this bank have been stipulated by this bank to be canceled from July 3. All funds deposited in the clearing account of this bank will be paid with application forms for interbank transfers. As for your bank's customer deposits and withdrawals, in addition to cash, parallel-lined checks will be used for payment. The style of this check is attached, please print it yourself to ensure uniformity. This is hereby notified, please investigate and handle it."

### Adapting to Wartime Material Conservation, Ping Bao Suspends Publication from Tomorrow, Resuming Publication When Materials are Sufficient

Ping Bao, established in Shanghai for nearly five years, will announce its suspension of publication starting tomorrow (July 1st) to respond to wartime material conservation policies. The reporter considers this a major change in the city's press circles, worthy of attention. Therefore, a special visit was made to the person in charge of the newspaper to inquire about everything. They sincerely made the following statement: "Our newspaper was founded on September 1, 1940, and has been through four years and ten months. Although it has encountered many difficulties during this short period, the colleagues of this newspaper, under the guidance and encouragement of Chairman Zhou Fohai, Managing Director Jun Qiang Luo, President Xiong Bai Jin, and Deputy Director Guangjie Lu, have strived to overcome difficulties and worked hard for the war and national policy. However, due to limited ability, little has been achieved, failing the heavy trust of the authorities and the expectations of society. Now, our Chairman Zhou, in view of the shortage of wartime materials, which urgently requires strict conservation, and the abundance of Chinese newspapers in this city, up to seven, each exerting its capabilities and possessing its readers, feels that manpower is dispersed and material resources are wasted. After several considerations, he resolutely decided to take the lead in suspending our newspaper to advocate for conservation. Chairman Zhou is responsible for the central government and also in charge of Shanghai's administration. To smoothly promote government decisions, he does not hesitate to sacrifice his own hard-earned business. His painstaking efforts should be admired by all parties. And although the colleagues of this newspaper have always regarded the newspaper business as a lifelong career, to implement national policy, they should gladly accept the order and take a temporary break, which is also hoped to be understood by people from all walks of life. When materials are sufficient in the future and the country needs the colleagues to teach and command, our newspaper can resume publication at any time, and the colleagues will definitely continue to struggle and implement the original intention."

Jin Employed as Consultant for this Newspaper

Jin Xiongbo, President of Ping Bao, is a leader in the press circles and has made many contributions to the press in recent years while presiding over Ping Bao. His contribution to the communication and promotion of unity among press colleagues is particularly great. This time, to adapt to the wartime material conservation policy, Ping Bao took the initiative to suspend publication. President Chen of this newspaper, considering that Jin has rich professional experience in the press and has made many contributions in the past, specially invited Jin to be a consultant for this newspaper, regularly coming to the office to guide everything, so as to learn from him.

### Bureau of Education Stipulates Tuition Standards for Next Semester, Director Dai's Press Conference Q&A

The press conference hosted by the Municipal Propaganda Office was held in the Municipal Government Conference Room at 10:30 AM yesterday. Director Dai Yingfu of the Municipal Bureau of Education attended and answered the questions raised by various press agencies in detail as follows:

Tuition Standards

(Question) Has the tuition standard for the next semester and private schools been stipulated as the summer vacation is approaching? If any schools do not comply with the stipulated standards, how do you plan to deal with it?

(Answer) The tuition standard for the first semester of the next academic year has been drafted. Based on the economic status of the students' families in each school, the amount of tuition and the percentage of free student places have been determined. The highest amount for high school is 20,000 yuan, and the lowest is 12,000 yuan. The highest amount for junior high school is 16,000 yuan, and the lowest is 10,000 yuan. The highest amount for senior elementary school is 12,000 yuan, and the lowest is 4,000 yuan. The highest amount for lower elementary school is 8,000 yuan, and the lowest is 3,000 yuan. The economic responsibility of private primary and secondary schools should be the responsibility of the board of directors. Therefore, the collection of tuition fees is tentatively approved by the principal to consult with the board of directors, determine the amount based on the economic conditions of the majority of students' families, draft a payment method in installments, and stipulate the number of free places, and report to the bureau for record. Violation of the ministry's order, collecting rice or converting it into money, will be reported to the municipal government for punishment. The above detailed methods are being submitted to the government for approval and will be announced and implemented upon approval.

Lane Schools

(Question) There are many private schools, the so-called lane schools, in Shanghai, and the internal facilities are simple. It not only misleads children but also hinders the development of the entire education system. Has the Bureau of Education considered banning them?

(Answer) The number of private schools in Shanghai is unprecedented in major cities around the world. After the incident, they sprung up like bamboo shoots after rain, and no one cared about them. The internal facilities are simple, but in this autumn of ten thousand times the price of goods, the difficulties of the school authorities are understandable. In my opinion, there are many children out of school. As long as the teachers are qualified and can run the school seriously, even if the equipment is slightly simpler, it is not necessary to be too demanding at this time. However, those who run corruptly should be banned.

Teacher Qualifications

Many schools, especially private schools, neglect the issue of teacher qualifications, and there are even elementary school students who have not graduated and are already serving as elementary school teachers. Does the Bureau of Education have any rectification measures?

(Answer) The issue of teacher qualifications is a serious problem in education after the incident. Excellent teachers have left schools due to the threat to their lives. At the beginning of my arrival in the deserted capital, I pointed out this seriousness and called for efforts to bring excellent teachers back to the affiliated schools. The bureau stipulates pay based on qualifications, and the government strives to improve teachers' treatment, which contains this profound meaning. There are graduates from university education colleges in this semester who came to municipal elementary schools to teach, and there are those who have served as heads of education for many years and are willing to serve as middle school principals. It must be said that excellent teachers have gradually returned to the schools. The situation in private schools is also different from school to school. There are many schools with a shortage of teachers. The bureau has formulated regulations on the appointment and dismissal of primary and secondary school teachers. There are regulations on the qualifications for the employment of primary and secondary school teachers, which will be gradually rectified in accordance with these regulations. These regulations will be announced and implemented once approved by the municipal government.

Change of School System

(Question) The three-semester system has not yet been approved by the Ministry of Education, but in general, schools are already implementing it privately. For example, St. John's University has already started school. I wonder how the Director of Education will deal with this?

(Answer) The two-semester system is stipulated by the Ministry of Education. Changing to three semesters concerns the entire national school system. The power lies with the state. The bureau received a report in May that some universities were considering changing to three semesters. Fearing that it would affect the overall situation, it immediately reported to the Ministry of Education. Minister Li was very angry about this and ordered Shanghai private colleges and universities not to change to three semesters without authorization. If what you said is true, the Ministry of Education will definitely ban it.

### Salary Change Donated to Charity School

Zhou Lü from the Transportation Section of the Shanghai Special Municipal Police Department wrote a letter saying: "Dear Sirs, Because there is a shortage of ten-yuan notes in the city, the small decimals at the time of salary payment cannot be issued according to the salary slip, so those who are less than 100 yuan are deducted. Now, I have collected 2,100 yuan in national currency, which I respectfully offer to be used as a "charity school fund". The small amount dares to say that it helps, so as to benefit all the Chinese police officers in this section."

### The Special Attack Force Base Under the Green Canopy

Before and after the brave parachute troops forcefully landed in enemy territory, special attack forces departing from a certain base successively crashed into enemy fleets, establishing tremendous military achievements. This time, the reporter made a special trip to observe the situation at that base.

That day, amid air raid sirens, we arrived at our destination. After a long spell of rain, the weather was very clear, and the entire base, like a fully inflated ball, was full of resilience. Utilizing the deep green trees and complex terrain, the headquarters of the unit and the crisscrossing passageways of the airfield were well concealed, making it extremely difficult for Grumman or B-29 type aircraft to detect. Moreover, the air defense equipment was perfect, putting people's minds at ease. That morning, the aviation unit here was ordered to provide cover for the special attack forces departing from other bases. When I arrived there, it was just about to take off.

"Damn it, today we're going to beat those Grummans to a pulp!" Soldiers in full flight gear, gripping their military swords, strode towards their aircraft.

At this moment, several formations of Grumman aircraft suddenly appeared in the distant sky, looking no bigger than sesame seeds. They circled the airfield once, seemingly discovering the aircraft that were taking off, and began to descend. Amid shouts of "Enemy planes!" "Enemy planes!", many mechanics, in order to protect the aircraft that had not yet taken off, refused to take shelter in the air raid shelters.

Banking sharply, diving steeply. In an instant, the enemy aircraft began to strafe the ground. In addition to machine guns, there seemed to be rockets as well. After several minutes of fierce fighting, the enemy aircraft, which had come to attack and restrain the battle of Okinawa, were finally scattered by anti-aircraft fire and fled in disarray. Only one of the planes that were about to depart was damaged, and the rest were completely unscathed. Then, according to the scheduled time, they took off from the airfield one after another and departed to attack the enemy.

"Haha, we're going to war!" For several days, because of the bad weather, the team members had long felt as if they were growing fat from being unable to go and kill the enemy. Being able to depart smoothly at this time made everyone overjoyed. In the earth-shaking roar, they bid farewell to the base.

A Burning Fighting Spirit

At this base, from the unit commander down to the privates, the lunch they ate was the same: barley rice and salted shredded radish. Although it was in the Japanese mainland, morning and evening, the field troops only ate dried or pickled vegetables.

"Two or three days ago, we ate cabbage, raw, and it tasted really good!" said a certain officer at headquarters.

Although life was so austere, the boldness of their spirit and the firmness of their fighting will were absolutely not affected in the slightest.

"Even if we have fewer aircraft than the enemy, we will never flinch!" said a certain lieutenant.

"No matter what, we've already given it to him! Damn it, let's turn Saipan upside down." Seeing the news of the enemy's carpet bombing, a soldier from Kanto said angrily.

This kind of vengeful psychology was extremely strong, from non-commissioned officers to field officers, and it can truly be said that their "spirit was soaring to the sky." This burning fighting spirit was the only guiding principle in their lives and dominated all their time.

Across the way, there were ordinary people's homes. Who would have thought that there would be two worlds so close together!

A State of Mind Where Man and Machine are One

"It would be great if everyone had the latest aircraft!" This was the hope of a certain unit commander.

This morning, a wireless telegram had come from the fleet of aircraft that had departed, saying that they were about to return. The unit commander felt very satisfied and immediately went to the airfield. Before long, returning friendly aircraft appeared from the continuous mountain peaks in the distance, one after another. Before long, they disbanded their formations and landed on the airfield one after another.

"I was really worried just now that they wouldn't be able to land safely. At first, when they departed, I couldn't rest easy. Although I waved my hat to send them off, I secretly held my breath until I saw the wheels leave the ground and the plane float in the air, and I finally breathed a sigh of relief," said a certain commander at the airfield. He regarded the precious aircraft as part of his own body.

A Unit Teeming with Talent

The unit here produced a plethora of talent, including Lieutenant Takashi Kurimura and Sergeant Isamu Sakamoto, who had crashed B-29s over Tokyo, one of whom received the Emperor's commendation and the other of whom received the Medal of Military Merit. In addition to these two distinguished people, there were also warriors who had shot down eighteen Grumman aircraft and destroyed six when enemy aircraft launched a large-scale air raid on Kanto.

"I don't think there could be a worse day than today." The returning warrior sighed.

Returning safely and still saying that his luck was bad really confused people. After going to investigate carefully, it turned out that it was because they had not encountered any opponents today.

"We were responsible for providing cover, and we returned safely. Except for two planes that had problems and were forced to land, the rest all returned without incident. The weather was good from the archipelago line to the Okinawa area, and the special attack force's attack was completely successful." This was their report upon returning. Although no battle took place en route, the important mission of protecting the special attack force was completely carried out.

"Don't crash recklessly," the captain earnestly warned his subordinates. (Special Correspondent Aji) (Translated from the June 29th edition of the Continental New Report)

### The Decisive Battle on the Mainland and the National Volunteer Corps

To prepare for the decisive battle on the mainland, the organization of the Japanese National Volunteer Corps has been largely completed throughout the country. Now that the ground battle on Okinawa Island has ended, the time for the decisive battle on the mainland is becoming increasingly urgent. And the National Volunteer Corps' national decisive battle organization is also burning with fighting spirit, and is beginning to take vigorous action towards its pure goal. The following is a record of questions and answers with a certain lieutenant colonel of the Army Ministry, from which the pure posture of the Japanese National Volunteer Corps can be seen.

Question: In order to carry out the decisive battle on the mainland, it is essential to first firmly establish an awareness of the decisive battle on the mainland. As long as there is a thorough awareness, one can enthusiastically engage in various preparations for the decisive battle. However, there are many optimistic observations in the civilian population, believing that the enemy may not land on the mainland. Under such circumstances, no matter how loudly you shout to the people that the decisive battle on the mainland is coming soon, it will be difficult to make them seriously prepare.

Answer: Whether the enemy will attack the mainland, of course, must be proven by future facts. However, from the strategic perspective of both sides, the inevitability of the decisive battle on the mainland can now be clearly understood, and this is the reason why we believe that the decisive battle on the mainland will inevitably occur. From the enemy's point of view, a landing operation directly attacking the mainland, which can determine the final result of the war, is the most important point of attack. Since the start of the Pacific counteroffensive, the decisive battle on the mainland is truly the finishing touch. For example, in baseball, the enemy, who has paid a great price in blood in places like Saipan, Iwo Jima, and Okinawa, and has scored some points, will be like automatically forfeiting the game in the end if they do not carry out an attack on the mainland. No matter how many points they score, they cannot be considered the winners.

There are currently nine hundred B-29 type aircraft in the Mariana Islands area, and the Okinawa base and Iwo Jima base are expected to expand rapidly in the future, and the strategic and tactical bombing of the enemy's base air force will be more thorough. Raids by thousands of enemy aircraft are expected to occur soon. However, raids cannot determine the final outcome of the war. In order to fight to the last round and strive for victory, the enemy must land on our mainland with boats or airborne troops. In the future, the enemy will make the bombing of the mainland thorough, and at the same time may carry out continental coastal operations, or land on the Korean coast, but the cumulative increase in the number of local decisive battles is intended only to facilitate the final battle, so the mainland must be the final battlefield, and the decisive battle on the mainland must be the last round.

However, due to the end of the European war, the enemy is eager for the war to end as soon as possible, and the increasing enemy losses are also making the enemy reluctant to make further local offensives, and instead directly attack the mainland in an attempt to launch a final decisive battle. This possibility is now quite large. We also have a fully adequate decisive battle strategy for the enemy's decisive battle strategy on the mainland. We truly have the advantages of terrain and popular support, and can concentrate all our forces to deal with the invading enemy, and no longer have the difficulties of isolated island warfare, and can meet the enemy in continental operations. Therefore, while the decisive battle on the mainland is desired by the enemy, it is also what we hope for. In past battles, the enemy has often been in an active position, but in the decisive battle on the mainland, they will reverse the old state of affairs and be initiated by us, trapping the enemy in a passive position. In other words, it is not a case of them attacking and us defending, but a bloodbath of attack against attack. If we do not have such a spirit, then our expectations for the decisive battle on the mainland are still not sufficient.

Question: The decisive battle on the mainland is a battle that is shared with the nation's destiny and territory. Due to the advantages of terrain and popular support, there are certainly many benefits of continental operations that can be obtained, and all the people of the country will rise up to defend the territory, but we should not close our eyes to the difficulties and disadvantages. We must point them out to make the people deeply understand them, so that the people can have a correct attitude towards the battle for the territory. Is that right?

Answer: In the isolated island operations up to now, we have only fought with a fixed number of troops. Although the enemy has been constantly increasing reinforcements, our garrison troops are always limited. This is because the enemy's mobile forces have an absolute advantage, so they can maintain their huge logistical arteries. However, the situation will be different in the decisive battle on the mainland. Our combat power, which was in an isolated state on the islands, can now ensure a deep defensive capability. The foundation of this deep defensive capability is, needless to say, the 100 million people and the territory. The enemy will of course extend the supply line to our mainland and try to counterattack our deep defensive capability. The decisive battle on the mainland is a battle against the long supply line maintained by enemy ships and aircraft. From the perspective of this logistical warfare, the decisive battle on the mainland is clearly advantageous to us. However, at that time, the army and the general public will fight side by side, so in the mainland battlefield where the front lines and the rear are intertwined and mixed, if the command, organization, and use of the people fighting alongside the army are disorganized, there is a danger that the army will be drawn into the chaotic vortex of the people. This is the disadvantage of the mainland becoming a battlefield.

Suppose the mainland has a million troops, but can only produce a million units of combat power, then it will be no different from isolated island warfare. To have a million troops with the combat power equivalent to three million or five million troops, this is the ideal decisive battle on the mainland. The establishment of the National Volunteer Corps and its future significance as a combat unit lies here. To command the people on the battlefield, to do their duty to the fullest, without losing wartime order in the slightest, so that the elite army can fight under the best conditions, this is the original mission of the National Volunteer Corps. We already have a well-trained and elite army, and we hope that the National Volunteer Corps will be the backing of this army, forming a deep defensive capability, so that the forward generals and soldiers can have no worries and concentrate on killing the enemy.

Question: The true mission of the National Volunteer Corps is to complete logistical tasks, which is very important. However, this point does not seem to be fully understood by the local end-level portions. The impression given by the end-level organization is that its mission is to lightly take up weapons and engage in combat, for example, farmers put down their hoes and are enthusiastic about bamboo spear training.

Answer: There are indeed such people. It must be that they are confused by the names of the Volunteer Corps and the Combat Unit. When you mention the Combat Unit, you think of grabbing a gun and going to the front line to kill the enemy. This is a misunderstanding and a lack of understanding of the true slander of modern total war. In total war, the entire people and the entire nation are combatants. Moreover, what determines the success or failure of modern war is not the front line, but how well the logistical preparations in the rear are. At the time of the decisive battle on the mainland, today's production limit determines tomorrow's war preparations. Because the situation is like this, the advancement of decisive battle preparations is all about the rise in production, and it can be said that the key to this is the members of the National Volunteer Corps. Production is combat, and during the decisive battle on the mainland, the relationship between the two is particularly close. Industrial soldiers in factories fighting in factories is combat; farmers working hard in the fields with their hoes is also combat; the people of the country are working hard in their respective positions, enthusiastically increasing production, which is the national attitude required by the country during the decisive battle on the mainland. Except for places that directly turn into battlefields, the above-mentioned principles will remain unchanged even when the National Volunteer Corps is converted into a combat unit. If a combat order has been issued, and the people each take up bamboo spears as weapons and act in a chaotic manner, the war will fail.

If the farmers drop their hoes and take up guns, then who will farm? If industrial soldiers put down their hammers and engage in combat training, then who will be responsible for producing tomorrow's munitions? Whether it is bamboo spear training or combat training, its true meaning lies only in cultivating the spirit of struggle. (Translated from the June 27th edition of the Continental New Report)

### Situation Map of Borneo and the Surroundings of Okinawa

The enemy forces attempted to land in the vicinity of Balikpapan, but the Japanese garrison and local volunteers fought bravely, causing the enemy to lose many ships and unable to advance.

Regarding the enemy forces on Okinawa Island, the enemy has recently rushed to build ten airfields in the southern part of the island, and the enemy's intentions to strengthen the base are becoming more apparent. The Japanese Air Force also discovered enemy fleet activity in the waters near the Kerama Islands. On the 26th of this month, the enemy forcibly landed on Kume Island, ninety kilometers west of Okinawa Island. After being dealt a head-on blow by the Japanese Air Force's special attack force and the navy, the enemy forces on Kume Island, the airfields on Okinawa Island, and the enemy fleet suffered heavy damage. Therefore, the enemy's activities during the Okinawa campaign have been greatly constrained.

### A Plea for Water

— Ting Qiu

"The seven necessities for opening the door," you can't do without it except for immortals. But in this era of skyrocketing living standards, how many families are not anxious about life? Who doesn't exhaust their minds and painstakingly seek to support a household?

The high prices can no longer keep people warm. And the endless disputes over tap water in recent months have given citizens new stimulation and threats.

An investigation found that there are no rivers or swamps within the urban area of this city. Daily water consumption depends entirely on the supply of tap water. Recently, the water and electricity company has adjusted its prices again, increasing them by two times compared to before. In addition, the fines for exceeding the limit have also been increased at the same time. This matter has too great an impact on the lives of citizens.

Water has a great relationship with human life. Limiting electricity is certainly a step that should be taken under the wartime system, but there are other substitutes that can be used. However, the restriction and punishment of "water" need to be relaxed and changed. Because there are no substitutes available, and there is no black market supply.

Recently, there have been quite a few people who have been fined for exceeding the water limit. The amount of the fine is as high as three to five million. Such a huge amount really gives people the feeling that "selling everything" is not enough to pay. Therefore, some areas have suffered the disaster of water cuts! Just imagine what the daily lives of those who suffer are like?

Most of those who are fined are large buildings, public places, and some alleys. The reason for the fine is that 19 out of 20 times, one total water meter is used as a public utility for several households. In the past, consumption was included in the rent and paid by the landlord. Only after consumption became expensive did it become the responsibility of the tenants themselves. In fact, the tenants do not know how much water they use each month, or how much the limit is. Therefore, unscrupulous agents arbitrarily add some handling fees, and the list of exploitations is endless. If the amount is small, the tenants have to pay it in pain in order to seek peace. If the amount is large, they really cannot afford it, so it causes many difficult to resolve disputes.

As far as the author knows, a certain place on Shanxi Road was fined more than 2 million last month. Because they were unable to pay for a while, they were cut off from water. It took half a month to raise the money and pay it off. But the water valve had not yet been opened, and it was said that a fine that was more than double the amount was coming next. Like this, aren't the citizens only obligated to pay fines, and have lost the right to use water? Such a huge amount of consumption is simply going to exceed other living expenses.

The reason given by the company authorities for fining users is because they exceeded the limit. Then, in order to avoid being fined, we should, on the one hand, adhere to the limit and save on daily consumption, and on the other hand, find a proper solution.

If there is only one total water meter for ordinary alley residents, they can each install a separate water meter (each costing about 50,000 to 60,000), and elect a manager among the residents to distribute the company's limit equally. In the future, if any household exceeds the limit, then the fine will be borne by the household that exceeds the limit. In this way, those who waste water can be alerted, and those who save water on a regular basis can avoid unjust fines, and all disputes can be easily resolved!

At the same time, I also thought of ordinary boiled water shops (commonly known as tiger stoves), which sell at a limited price of 20 yuan per ladle under the high consumption, coal prices, and expenses. Their water consumption is of course many times more than that of ordinary households. Don't we see that some boiled water shops have already stopped operating? An investigation of the reasons for their closure found that 19 out of 20 times, it was nothing more than fines for consumption. Therefore, all those who are barely operating have to raise prices in an attempt to make up for it. In this way, doesn't the tap water company indirectly create a black market for water?

We have to appeal to the主管機關 (competent authorities). For the sake of protecting the lives of citizens and removing the threat of "water"! At the same time, we earnestly request the current 관리부국 (management bureau) to consider the common interests of the Chinese and Japanese people today, relax the water limit, and reduce fines.

### On the Remittance Order

— Ku Kou

The circulation of remittance orders in the market was, at the time, a temporary relief method. The so-called relief was because the current currency was not sufficient for payment, and there was no other way to do it. Unexpectedly, a good cause led to a bad result. In theory, this phenomenon should not have occurred. Let me explain in detail:

As the name implies, a remittance order represents immediate remittance and transfer, and there is no reason to keep it without transferring it and use it as currency for circulation.

For every remittance order opened, there must of course be funds deposited in the Central Reserve Bank of China or the Bank Reserve Association and the Money Industry Reserve to prepare before opening it. There should never be remittance orders opened without deposits.

Remittance orders are for relieving the shortage of currency and meeting deposit requirements. They should not be regarded as issuing a remittance order, which is equivalent to granting the right to circulate.

The above three points are extremely common and should be known to all, without the need for detailed explanation. However, in fact, none of them go against the grain, resulting in today's adverse consequences of remittance orders, which is very strange. What caused this? In a word, the main reason is that the current currency is in greater demand than supply. All kinds of illegal acts by people in pursuit of exorbitant profits, seeking profits regardless of everything, so that extremely good methods get extremely bad results, which is also one of the important reasons. What is past is past, and what is to come can be pursued. Following the remittance order, each bank and firm will use parallel line checks to pay for deposits and withdrawals, which will be implemented soon. The issuing banks and firms should handle the matter with caution, because a little carelessness will be extremely harmful to society. Here are my humble opinions, which are divided into the following sections, for the reference of people in society and financial workers.

Parallel line checks are still a type of transfer instrument and should be transferred immediately and not regarded as a type of current currency.

The issuing banks and firms of parallel line checks should bear full responsibility and should not issue them arbitrarily.

The holder of the check must pay attention to the credit of the issuing bank and firm. If you do not pay attention and regard it as the same as currency, and suffer damage, it will be too late to regret it. The method of paying attention can be illustrated by an example. For example, A should receive 1 million from B. B pays with a parallel line check from C's bank and firm. A should focus on whether he can trust C's bank and firm. If he cannot trust it, he can refuse to accept it. This is the freedom of the right holder, and the debtor cannot object.

When parallel line checks are issued, the details of the issuance process should be recorded in detail for verification. If it is found that a bank or firm is using this check for illegal activities, it should be ordered to immediately suspend business and severely punished. Each bank and firm should fill in the outstanding balance that has not been transferred and report it to the Silver and Money Industry Association for verification.

Parallel line checks are a temporary measure to relieve the shortage of currency supply. The Central Reserve Bank of China, which issues currency, should quickly seek fundamental improvement methods, increase the issue of banknotes, nourish the issuance of this check, or even stop it.

Since the issuance of remittance orders has been stopped, those that have been issued should be quickly transferred, recovered, and canceled. The Silver and Money Industry Association should officially announce a deadline for completion and clearing, and order each bank and firm to prepare a balance statement at the end of the deadline and deposit the balance separately.

To sum up, the bottom line is that the method is determined by people. After replacing the remittance order with this instrument, whether the problem of currency shortage can be solved smoothly depends entirely on people.

### Founding Obligatory Vocational Schools

— Jiwen

After reading "Establishing Compulsory Secondary and Higher Education" in the 14th issue of this publication, I also have some opinions below.

Establishing compulsory higher education is certainly a very necessary thing, but establishing obligatory vocational schools is also an urgent matter at present. Because many young people in employment have taken up their jobs due to poverty, they are very eager to study and improve themselves. To address their educational needs, the most convenient approach is to start from their own circumstances and environment.

Most industrial and commercial capitalists adopt an attitude of "the less trouble, the better," but wise capitalists will surely know that if they establish obligatory vocational schools to educate their employees, it will not only not be a loss to them, but on the contrary, it will be to their benefit. Those who complain about meager pay will now receive spiritual benefits; after a period of training, their standards will all improve; if the educational level of employees is raised, won't the efficiency of their service also increase? If employees feel grateful for the opportunity and are therefore wholeheartedly loyal, wouldn't that be a great gain for the capitalists? On the other hand, the employees will also receive great benefits.

However, this matter still requires the guidance and leadership of the education authorities; on the one hand, they should persuade the industrial and commercial sectors about the meaning and purpose of this, and further explain the advantages and disadvantages, so that even the stubborn will earnestly be willing to do it. Then, they should think of ways to make a concrete and systematic plan, forming units like guilds in various industries and setting up an obligatory school for each unit. After the small units in each unit acknowledge the expenses they should contribute, the matter can immediately be actively carried out.

On the one hand, they should conduct a registration of those who need to receive higher education. Although many employees have been influenced by society and do not think about studying and progressing, a considerable portion of us are limited by circumstances and eagerly hope to seek further education. If the obligatory vocational schools are run for some time, those industrial and commercial employees who have been isolated from books may also be influenced by their surroundings and think about participating in reading, transformed by the atmosphere of everyone.

Regarding classrooms, teachers, curriculum, teaching materials, and other issues, it naturally remains for the education authorities to allocate and provide guidance, whether through borrowing or hiring part-time staff. Generally, there should be no difficulties. For class division, it is best to divide them into several levels according to the level of proficiency. Because the main subjects are electives and require special knowledge of various industries, the obligatory schools of various industries cannot be combined for classes. However, there is much basic common knowledge among various industries that can be taught together to save costs in all aspects. Regarding these things, it can be determined based on the situation at the time, and initially, there is no need to limit it to certain rules.

In short: If obligatory vocational schools can be managed in an orderly manner, and all parties can enthusiastically and vigorously carry them out, it won't be long before the results are certainly impressive. The speech and attitude of industrial and commercial employees will definitely improve or change unexpectedly, and at least, the spiritual aspect will be enriched significantly.

### Abolish Discounting

— Longying

The discounting of "allocation slips" has the greatest impact on ordinary people. A friend who is a middle school teacher works hard for a month and gets an allocation slip for 100,000 yuan. He first converts it into smaller denominations, and then converts it into cash. With the cash, he can only buy one dou and one sheng of rice. At the same time, a low-level employee of a certain bank can get 200,000 yuan in cash every day, and by discounting it at "two jiao," he can net 40,000 yuan. In addition, senior employees, using their job convenience, indirectly discount the cash, which has also become an open secret. Therefore, the crying ones cry, and the laughing ones laugh, only to invisibly raise prices by 20,000.

After the circulation of allocation slips is stopped from July 3rd, the problem of cash shortage in the market will not be solved as a result. If each bank and firm is allowed to issue "bank drafts" on its own, it is still the same old wine in a new bottle. If bank drafts cannot be discounted at all, then the common people will suffer. If discounting is allowed to run rampant, it is equivalent to the former "drawing head," and the discount rate will rise endlessly. How will the common people live in the future?

As a commoner, I have shallow knowledge of the national monetary policy and should not make reckless comments, but I always feel that there is room for discussion on the method of tightening cash. Therefore, from now on, I think the first priority should be to check the cash inflow and outflow of the banks themselves; second, the 10,000 yuan should be considered for issuance; third, the circulation of "allocation slips" and "bank drafts" can be completely cancelled, so that "discounting" cannot occur; fourth, the capital in this port should be used for legitimate productive purposes; fifth, the cash in other ports and rural areas should also be retrieved.

At this time and in this place, to achieve the above points, the cooperation of friendly countries is also needed. It is necessary to know that the importance of the cash problem is no less than the rice problem.

### The Comet That Never Shined

— He Jiong

This time, carrying a bit of light creation, I returned to my hometown, N City, which I had been away from for ten years. I stayed in the hospital for more than a month. After being discharged, my mother specially rented two houses for me in the nearby countryside, wanting me to rest there. Partly because I couldn't bear to disappoint my mother too much, and partly because I had a bit of nostalgia for my hometown, which I had originally disliked, I finally stayed temporarily. However, for someone like me who has always been busy, rest is almost a punishment. I always like to take long walks, hoping to encounter some new things by chance; I have also visited the homes of many friends from the past, but I can hardly meet an old acquaintance. I felt lonely, and I missed them even more. I waited every day with a hopeful heart for a new and unexpected encounter.

Finally, one morning, I was idly walking on a road leading to the city, when a thin woman walked past me. Her overly thin body had a sickly appearance at first glance, but this back view and walking posture were so familiar! Because I was walking aimlessly, she was already two or three zhang ahead of me. I slightly increased my pace to catch up, and the sound of my footsteps startled her. She turned her head and revealed a surprised expression: "Eh! Jiong, is that you?" After a slight recognition, I found a unique red mole on her thin left cheek. "Ah! Yingzi, is that you!" I really couldn't say I recognized her. If it weren't for that clear mark. She had changed so much. Who could believe that the woman whose vitality had been taken away by more than half was the same lively and healthy Yingzi from before? The one who once stirred up my ardent love, although I only tasted a bit of unrequited love, I had always been missing her and blessing her! Standing in front of her, my heart was filled with a complex emotion that was difficult to name: embarrassment, sorrow, regret... With trembling hands, I grasped her bony hand, and I felt her trembling as well. I remembered that this hand used to be strong, and when I held it, she would often try to pull it away forcefully, but today she let it lie limply in my hand. I saw that her eyes were wet.

"Jiong! Do you still recognize me? It's been ten years!"

"How could I forget you? But you are too different from before. How did you become so thin?" I saw that the flesh on her cheeks had completely disappeared, and a pair of large eyes were sunken in, dull, looking at people as if they had lost their brilliance.

"I don't know either," she seemed unwilling to say more. "It's getting late now. Can I come to your house to see you this afternoon?" I saw the stack of books under her armpit, and I knew that she must be teaching. I couldn't bear to ask her about the past. I thought her heart must be filled with heavy sorrow, so I told her my address, and she left in a hurry. I looked at her thin back, and I felt sad for her loss of vitality. I remembered that when we were together before, she was still a high school student, and I was still studying at C University. Because I and a few friends had organized an extracurricular reading club, she also joined through the introduction of a friend. When she first came, she was completely a good girl from a traditional family, gentle and refined, silent and寡言. Apart from reading, she knew nothing else, yet her body was plump and healthy. Later, she gradually learned a lot of knowledge. In less than a year, she completely changed her appearance. She had a very strong ability to distinguish, understand, and remember. Coupled with her efforts, her social knowledge progressed exceptionally. She was very good at speaking, able to speak eloquently in public, able to criticize bravely, and able to write essays that flowed smoothly. She had a cheerful and bright personality, and she was quick and thorough in her work. Every friend thought she was a very promising child, and she also had a sweet and pleasing face. The friends in the club had very good friendships with her. I dare not believe that I had any outstanding qualities, but because my place of residence was close to hers, the opportunities for us to discuss and talk were relatively more. Therefore, our feelings were also more harmonious. Although she was five or six years younger than me, I could certainly give her some guidance at first, but soon she not only understood my thoughts, but sometimes would give me encouragement and warnings. Indeed, she was so smart. In fact, she was only a fifteen or sixteen year old child at that time, but she already understood everything. Talking with her always made people feel happy and refreshed. Although she did not like to dress up, the natural girlish vitality she showed made people feel the purest true beauty.

Later, our club also opened a public night school, and she took on the main work of the women's department. Every night, we would return in the dark. Sometimes we were immersed in the bright moonlight, talking and walking, and our hearts were very close. Of course, in this situation, everyone would forgive me for having a love for her, right? She was such a lovable girl! I believed that we would definitely be able to get mutual help in our careers in the future. It's just that I have a cousin, who can be considered my fiancée. Because she had no parents, she had always been in my house. Therefore, when I asked her for her love, she refused to accept it. She said, "Jiong, please don't mention these annoying things! Our feelings were originally very good. If you must talk about these things, I will become estranged from you." What was I supposed to do? Before, when I had not told her that I loved her, when we walked in the moonless night, she would naturally lean against me, and I would hold her hand tightly, and she would also hold mine very tightly; but later, when I held her, she would always pull it away from my hand. I couldn't believe that she didn't love me. I asked her directly, and she said, "I love you like I love my own brother, can't I?" I told her that my cousin didn't know how to read a few words, and I had never loved her. It would be easy to break off the engagement. But when I talked to her about these things, she would stay far away from me. I asked her why, and she said, "Aren't we happy being friends like this? In the future, when you get married, we can still work together in our careers, and everyone will be happy. If you hurt a poor girl, everyone will be troubled instead. I absolutely don't want you to be so willful. Besides, I am already very satisfied with our current friendship and don't need further love." What else could I say to her? Maybe she was still just a child, thinking about things so simply, or it could be said that she was too 민事 (civilized/reasonable), thinking so thoughtfully. She could understand me from any point of view or occasion, but on this point, she seemed to intentionally not understand me. I knew that although she looked strong in character, she had a compassionate heart. She simply never treated anyone harshly. She could forgive all unfortunate people. She loved her family, loved her friends, loved humanity, and she protected her female compatriots even more. Precisely because her heart was too gentle, it was also her weakness. She would often let emotions exceed reason, softened by her mother's tears. I often said that she still lacked courage, but she did not show pity for my heart that ardently loved her. What a strange girl! Only on the eve of my departure, she was still unable to return because of family ties. She shed tears for me. Taking this opportunity, I boldly kissed her. She did not refuse me as I had expected. I asked her, and she said, "Since we are about to part, why should I be stingy with this little bit and make you uncomfortable? I have never hated you!" What memorable words!

After that, the mist separated our news, but I have never stopped remembering and blessing her. I have always believed that she is a new woman who can exert some power for mankind.

This afternoon after our meeting, she found my house. Seeing her weak body, I was filled with grief. I really didn't dare to ask her anything anymore; she told me on her own initiative: her sickly father had died eight years ago, leaving behind her mother and two younger siblings. She had no choice but to abandon her plan to go to work in a distant place and take on the burden of the family. So she taught, and at the same time, she was unwilling to give up social activities, so she had to busy herself with public night schools and various affairs. Later, the cost of living rose day by day. She had to work non-stop every day, and she still couldn't feed her family. The surrounding environment became more and more harsh, and her resentment became more and more intense. She had a boiling passion, she had a fighting spirit, but she also passionately loved her mother and younger siblings, and she could not resolutely do the social work she wanted to do. She still struggled under the burden of the family, and coupled with the hardships of life, she finally became ill, suffering from lung disease. She still needed to work non-stop, and her love and hate became even more turbulent. She became more active in social causes, but her illness gradually worsened. It's a pity that even though she had a firm and courageous spirit and a heart full of energy, she still couldn't defeat the invasion of the disease. Now she is a patient with advanced lung disease. When she speaks to me, she often has to clench her teeth, and sometimes she will clench her fists. I know that her heart is extremely painful. I have great regret for her. Everyone had great hopes for her, a new youth general, how could she be extinguished so easily? I sympathize with her, pity her, respect her, and love her. I am too excited. I wish I could use my enthusiasm to help her. I want to kiss her, but she pushes me away forcefully and says, "I am already finished. We are already on different paths. You still have many things to do. You should create. Do you also want to destroy yourself?" I stare at her blankly. Is she really finished? My heart feels like it is pressed under a weight. It is her shadow, gradually sinking, sinking. I know that this comet will not shine!

### An Extraordinary Encounter

— Wang Xiyao

One day, near noon, I came out of school and strolled along Jing'an Temple Road. I saw some silk stockings in a shop window that I liked very much, so I went inside. It was a very fashionable clothing store, with a fat foreign old woman who was probably the owner, and several young female clerks.

One of the female clerks was very dazzling, wearing a very tight floral silk cheongsam, giving a sense of "graceful and upright," with a lot of powder on her face and blue eye shadow, with a bit of coquettishness in her beauty, truly a typical "vase."

When I told her what I wanted, she took out two boxes for me to choose from. I asked her if they had nine-inch ones. She very gently told me that nine inches were too small, that men usually wore nine and a half inches, and she looked at my feet and said that nine inches would be the most suitable for me. Her considerate and gentle attitude made me feel a little uneasy. On the one hand, I admired the foreign old woman for employing such good female clerks, which could really attract customers.

While I was picking, she noticed a red leather-bound book with gold lettering on the glass counter, "A History of Chinese Diplomacy." She asked me, "Are you also studying politics?" This surprised me. Why would a female clerk care about the books a customer was reading? And how could her brain, filled with powder, have any shadow of "politics" and "economics"? I casually agreed, unable to think of a way to ask her a question in return. She then said, "We don't use this kind of book." I was even more surprised. Was she also studying? So I asked her, "Are you also studying politics? Which school do you attend?" She nodded and told me the name of the school, and also said, "Classes at school start after five o'clock, so I do some work here during the day." I said, "Then we are comrades!" She smiled, and dimple-like smiles appeared on her face, asking me my name and hoping for a lot of guidance.

After I bought what I wanted, she sent me out. I glimpsed that she was wearing the latest style of snakeskin shoes, with a gold bracelet in her stockings.

On the way back, I was suspicious. How could such a glamorous young woman, whom people would definitely think was engaged in some kind of profession, be a proper college student? And why would she want to use the name of a university as a cover?

Under strong curiosity, one evening, I stepped into a certain university.

There was no such glamorous小姐 (miss/lady) in the classroom! But in a moment, I saw her, but what shocked me was that her appearance was completely different from that day, to the point that I suspected it was another person with a similar face.

She was wearing a sky-blue cloth cheongsam and white running shoes, how pure and simple, how gentle and quiet, diligently taking notes.

"They are completely different people," I wandered in the corridor. The bell rang, and students came out of the classroom.

Just as I was about to leave, she saw me.

"Eh, Mr. Wu..." She turned her face, which had no powder on it, towards me.

"Is class over?" I felt a little embarrassed and had to tell a lie to explain my intention, "I'm here to see a classmate."

"Who is it?" she asked.

"He... he didn't come." I felt a little embarrassed in my heart.

"Then let's go back!"

We walked down the stairs together and stepped into the noisy city street, finally shaking hands at the entrance of her alley.

The next day, as I passed the fashionable clothing store again by streetcar, I curiously paid attention. Through the glass window, I glimpsed her again, with a lot of powder on her face and blue eye shadow. A wave of confusion attacked my heart.

I couldn't help but feel sad for working women.

### Last Night

— Xiao Mo

Tomorrow,

The feet of the soldier,

Have already rushed to the ends of the earth.

Tonight,

The heart of the one who sends him off,

Still lingers in last night.

Last night's dishes were rich;

Last night's reminders were gentle.

Last night, he said to me:

"Don't sigh for the lost past,

Remember to seize the solid present.

Even if the lifespan of human life is limited,

You should also work faithfully and live happily!"

I also remember his words of advice last night:

"You are surrounded by surging waves,

You should practice your swimming skills,

After crossing the ferocious sea,

A flat place will be seen!"

Last night's reminders were gentle,

Last night's dishes were rich.

Tonight,

The heart of the one who sends him off,

Still lingers in last night;

Tomorrow,

The feet of the soldier,

Have already rushed to the ends of the earth!

### Sino-Portuguese Cup Resolved, Chinese Team Wins Championship

— Amateur

The Sino-Portuguese Cup football league match between the Chinese team and the Portuguese team was held at the racecourse on the 26th of this month (this Tuesday) at 5:45 PM. As the Portuguese team won the first match, and the Chinese team won the second, this game was the focus of contention. It's no wonder both teams used their most ideal lineups, reversing the carelessness of the previous two matches. Their ambition was evident.

The previous issue of this publication carried Mr. Bixian's righteous argument regarding the Chinese team's lineup, including names like Jia Youliang, who was initially excluded. At the time, I found it rather strange. However, when the Football Association granted a special pardon, allowing Jia and others to participate, I realized that Mr. Bixian's contribution had already subtly conveyed this profound intention. The Football Association authorities sincerely adopted it, enabling them to achieve complete success, defeating Portugal 2-0 and bringing back the championship trophy. This is truly gratifying and congratulatory. Here is a brief account of the situation, along with commentary.

In the first half, the Chinese team showed great progress at the beginning, but unfortunately, due to poor coordination and a lack of effective shooters, their efforts ultimately fell short. The Portuguese team held a clear advantage. Li Tiansheng, Zhuang Youren, and others' strengths were rendered useless. In the second half, Li Yichen of the Chinese team scored a goal, but it was ruled invalid due to Xu Wenkui's offside. Soon after, Mike, from Portuguese commerce, also scored a goal, but it was also disallowed because Pantsson was offside. This can be considered a coincidence. Subsequently, Lai Hanlong and Hai's abundant stamina led to two consecutive goals, securing the victory and ensuring that the Sino-Portuguese Cup, newly revived, fell into the hands of our Chinese team.

Chinese Team's Strength Ultimately Triumphs

Overall, the match lacked exciting moments. Both sides seemed to be unfamiliar with each other. Smooth coordination and fierce tackling were not frequently seen. Regarding the situations of both teams, defense seemed to be prioritized over offense. The strategy on both sides was to disrupt the opponent's attack, while neither attack was able to find a way to break through the opponent's defense. Consequently, with neither side's offense being particularly sharp, the excitement was naturally diminished. The Chinese team's ultimate victory was due to their concerted effort. For example, Meng Yi's support and response, and Li Tiansheng's focus on Fu En, were both outstanding successes, earning praise from fans. The Portuguese team's loss was most clearly due to the major error of using Kao Si as a substitute for Xu Erzi in the second half. Xu is a defender, and trying him as a forward led to numerous loopholes, allowing Jia and Han to be very active. The Portuguese team is known for their intelligent and effective adjustments. It's unclear why they made such a mistake this time, which is truly puzzling.

Chinese Team Members Performed Well

Regarding individual techniques, Zhang Banglun was more steady than before, able to avoid losing the ball, which is commendable. Li Tiansheng was able to contain Fu En, proving that he is still strong despite his age. It's not an easy feat. Meng Yiliang, in the absence of Tan Fuzhen and Song Lingbian, took on the key role of midfielder, supporting and responding, proving to be no less capable than the two absent players. Yu Liming's speed was necessary on the defensive line. Han Longhai's ability to score goals cannot be overlooked. Han's threatening movements were undeniable. Jia Youliang spent most of the time switching positions with Han Longhai, diligently bringing the ball back. Li Yichen shook off his exhaustion. Although there were some signs of unfamiliarity, his hard work is worth mentioning. Xu Wenkui's pass from the left wing, leading to a goal, was beautiful. Han Longhai's second goal came from Xu Wenkui's pass. As for Zhuang Youren, Zhang Lingen, Gao Baozheng, and Luo Choufu, while they didn't have outstanding performances, they were able to maintain their level.

Portuguese Team Lacked Highlights

On the Portuguese side, Oliveira was the best, with a commanding presence. Second was V. Su, whose activity and long-range shots threatened our team. Fu En was effectively contained by our side, unable to display his prowess. Pantsson and his brother also failed to shine with Xing Fu En. Kao Si was increasingly steady. It's unclear why he was taken off the field in the second half. Xu Erzi and Lai Liao, the two forwards, had more courage than wisdom and are not worth mentioning. Defender Ke Yetuo was better than Victor, who was tiresome.

Attention Should Be Paid to Order Inside the Field

Finally, I have another observation: there were too many spectators inside the field. The biggest shortcoming was that countless spectators stood on both sides of the goal, surrounding the goal in layers, often leaving the referee with the difficulty of making a decision. For example, when Han Longhai scored the first goal in the match, the opponent Pan Limi quickly retrieved the ball from the net. At the same time, some fans, overjoyed, rushed across the goal line to cheer, providing the opponents with an excuse to cause a dispute. The referee was indeed caught in a dilemma, unable to make a clear decision in the crowd, which was a major flaw. Secondly, the general public in the grandstand, with limited spending power, had no choice but to watch from afar. They were essentially amateur fans and wouldn't mind this. However, the fact that people inside the field were obstructing the view of the field deprived them of the opportunity to enjoy the best moments, which was disappointing. As one of the people in the grandstand, I have repeatedly complained about this situation. For most of the time, we were left with empty joy and disappointment because we couldn't see the ball near the goal. Therefore, I sincerely hope that the authorities will restrict spectators inside the field. If this affects revenue, I won't protest. But order must be maintained. In other words, spectators should be absolutely prohibited from standing near the goal. This would benefit the amateur fans in the grandstand and reduce unnecessary disputes in the match. I understand that the Football Association is currently hosting a summer football invitational tournament. I hope that this point will be seriously considered and not lightly overlooked at that time. This would be very fortunate.

### Unbearable to Recall Tennis: China Real Estate Tennis Club to Hold Charity Match

— Mei

Tennis is a sport suitable for summer, but for the past year or two, this sport has been virtually silent. This year, it is even considered a sport for the nobility, making it impossible for the average person to enjoy. In fact, this sport has always been more upscale than others. However, it was still possible to勉强 purchase tennis balls in the past. This summer, amidst rising prices, the cost of tennis balls has also increased. As far as I know, a single tennis ball costs nearly 100,000 yuan. Imagine, how can the average person afford this? This is of course an inevitable result of weak purchasing power. This has buried many talented players and caused a seasonal sport to become dormant and unable to develop.

China was slow to develop a passion for tennis. It seems that after Qiu Feihai (deceased) and Lin Bao won the championship in the 8th Far Eastern Games, the interest of the Chinese people increased. Of course, it was not yet widespread at that time. Later, it gradually became popular, and the Chinese people gradually paid attention to it. As a result, many talents were gradually discovered, such as Zheng Zhaofu and Xu Chengji, who achieved glory overseas. In particular, Xu Chengji's level even caught up with the world stage, which clearly showed that China has a natural talent for this sport. Eight years ago, the world-famous star Tilden Barnes came to Shanghai to perform, which also increased the level of the audience at that time. Although many players have learned the secrets of the sport, unfortunately, this aristocratic sport has become more and more aristocratic, leading to a phenomenon of叹息ing at the ball.

In this year's reality, we didn't even want to write about this news. But out of the blue, a good news came that a sport we had almost forgotten will have an opportunity to be appreciated. Of course, this must be a masterpiece like a昙花一现, but precisely because of this, we should feel its preciousness even more, not to mention that it is a sport that is suitable for the season? That is, the China Real Estate Tennis Club will have a tennis charity match in the near future, which is of course welcome and is a charity event that benefits others. Now I would like to briefly introduce everything about the China Real Estate Tennis Club.

Organizational situation of China Real Estate Tennis Club

The China Real Estate Tennis Club is organized by members of the China Real Estate Association. The club has almost exhausted the first-rate players in Shanghai tennis. Conversely, the players who are good at tennis are suffering from the lack of opportunity to show their skills. With such an opportunity, they will naturally flock to it and gather like-minded people in one place. The China Real Estate Tennis Club has a sound team organization, with Lin Kanghou as the president, Wu Yong'an, Xu Wenzhao, and Ma Runfang as the vice presidents, Li Leishi as the general secretary, and Tang Shizhen and Ling Zhizhang as the deputy general secretaries. These are all capable talents. Therefore, the China Real Estate Tennis Club is the only one remaining in Shanghai, and it has the perseverance to organize a charity match.

Shanghai Tennis Will Be Brought Together

Looking at the list of players, there is Zhou Guanjun as the captain, and the soldiers are Wang Wenzheng, Tao Guanqiu, Wei Shisun, Wang Jichang, Jing Maoqing, Xu Chengwei, Guo Ying, Jing Renqing, Xiao Xuehai, Cai Guoji, Zhang Dingzhao, Ye Weijian, Li Leishi, Sun Yan, Fan Wencai, Meng Guangming, Jin Zhizhang, and Zhang Xiaolong, etc. Of course, it is clear at a glance that the old generals are gathered together. Newcomers are coming, and it can be called a concentration camp for tennis players. Among them, the most attention-grabbing are Wang Wenzheng and Tao Guanqiu. The former's reputation as a master has a history. Tao Guanqiu was originally a professional player. Since he regained his amateur status in Hong Kong, he has relied on his youth to achieve the ultimate in his tennis skills. He is almost invincible in Shanghai, but he and Wang Wenzheng have never officially played against each other. It is said that in this charity match, the two of them have agreed to compete alone. Therefore, the mystery of Wang and Tao, although they can dominate the Shanghai tennis scene, can be solved. And the fans who have not had a wonderful tennis match for a long time will not give up this excellent opportunity. In addition, there are Ju Guanjun, Li Leishi, Zhang Dingzhao, etc., who are all famous players. Cai Guoji and Xu Chengwei are rising stars. I think in this charity match, we will definitely be able to enjoy it like a long-awaited rain after a drought.

Ticket Revenue Used to Fund Scholarships

As for the purpose of this charity match, the ticket revenue will be donated to Xinwenbao and this newspaper as scholarships to benefit poor students, which is worth promoting!

Finally, I would like to briefly introduce the tennis court. The address is 285 Wuyuan Road (Zhao Zhujiao Road), inside the China Real Estate Association. The transportation is not very convenient. Take a tram to Shanzhong Road, and walk west along Wuyuan Road for a maximum of five minutes. The court is the most standard, and the field has been carefully laid out, so the elasticity is extremely suitable. What is more worth writing is that there is shade, so when there is a breeze, sitting on the court and watching the players perform is a refreshing experience. The only drawback is that there is not much space for spectators to accommodate on all sides, so it is inevitable that some people will be unable to watch.

Now, I don't want to talk more. When the club has progress news, I will report in the next issue!

### Baseball Veteran Liang Fuchu Talks About Baseball and Softball Movement in Shanghai - Sino-Japanese Softball Showdown on July 4

— Miao

Mr. Liang Fuchu, the coach of the Panda team, a strong Chinese team in this year's Softball League, is a veteran in China's baseball world. According to records, Mr. Liang was a baseball player in Japan at the age of fifteen and has represented the Chinese team in matches in Japan and as a representative of the Far Eastern Games several times. Mr. Liang has been a baseball instructor in Japan, Hong Kong and Shanghai for nearly thirty years and is famous at the time. Since Mr. Liang became the instructor of the Panda team in this year's league, their technology has improved rapidly. Admiring his name, the writer specially visited Mr. Liang at his private residence to discuss the state of baseball and softball sports in Shanghai. The interview process is recorded as follows.

Baseball Movement in Shanghai is in the Development Era

Mr. Liang first said that in recent years, 관人 have gradually become interested in baseball and softball, which is a very good phenomenon. Because our country's sports have always been behind. Except for football and basketball, which are more popular, baseball and softball are rarely noticed by Chinese people. It is necessary to promote this. In the Far Eastern Games, the Chinese people's baseball is a great witchcraft compared with Japan and the Philippines. In the past two or three years, there has been a softball league sponsored by Westerners in the summer. Only the Panda team has joined. According to Mr. Liang's 40 years of experience, observing the baseball and softball technology of various teams in Shanghai today, he said that they are still in their infancy, but they will definitely develop in the future. He believes that in the future international relations, baseball and softball will definitely surpass football and basketball, which is Mr. Liang's assertion. Therefore, Mr. Liang first hopes that the press and sports circles will vigorously promote volleyball, and secondly, he hopes that more Chinese people will organize baseball and softball teams, and use competitions to improve technology and interest. Finally, Mr. Liang added that he will organize a baseball club to train future generations, so that our country's baseball can be as popular and developed as football and basketball, and that our country will also occupy a considerable position in the international baseball world.

Each team's short-hitting defense lacks precision training

Last Sunday (24th), the Panda team was scheduled to compete with the Philippine Overseas Chinese team. Later, the Philippine team temporarily misrepresented the information, and the Panda team changed to a friendly match with a mixed team of Japanese Overseas Chinese and the Western Youth team. On that day, there were thousands of spectators. Under the tactical guidance of Mr. Liang, the Chinese team won 8-4. In this match, the mixed team played with the most ideal lineup, such as pitcher Kaiji Milov, catcher Burke and Miura, shortstop Ueshima and other famous generals. In the third inning, the mixed team took a 2-0 lead. In the fourth inning, Wang Nianzu of the Chinese team got a "second base hit", and later catcher Wang Xiushan hit a medium-high ball "sacrifice hit", allowing Wang Nian to score a point. In the fifth inning, the mixed team got a "full base" (Po ll base) and no outs (No down) with a good batting. Under this critical situation, it was Kouri's turn to bat. He swung with all his might and hit a fast ball that was intercepted by shortstop Liang Youji, and Maus, who was on second base, was called out by Jie Yousheng. Later, Mr. Liang quickly made a three-player out, allowing Nogami to exit. This three-kill (Triple kill) scene was clear and fast, winning a lot of praise. At this time, the situation changed. Coach Liang quickly guided the Chinese team to use short attacks. Sure enough, in the fifth inning, the Chinese team, led by Liang Youyi, Wen Ruixiong, Wen Tianhua, and Li Qi, continued to use short hits to get on base and score points, turning defeat into victory. In this match, Mr. Liang said that the teams in Shanghai lack training in short-hitting defense technology. If they can use short hits, they will cause panic and confusion in other teams. Therefore, the Chinese team also used short hits in this match, causing the mixed team to be exhausted and finally losing their position. Mr. Liang also stated that in a softball match, the offense should use more short hits, because softball is not as strong as baseball, and nineteen out of ten balls are intercepted by the outer wings. This can be seen from the fact that the Chinese team's victory over the Samurai on Thursday was entirely due to short hits. In this match, the Chinese team's defense was precise. Wen Ruixiong got a "full base hit" in the sixth inning, and in the fourth and fifth innings, the Chinese team frequently used short bats, and the players went on base like a revolving lantern. As a result, they won 12-0, which was also the result of Mr. Liang's guidance.

Whether the team can win depends on the fighting spirit

Mr. Liang finally said that the most important thing in baseball games is fighting spirit, which is a matter of experience. I still remember that in 19 every time in the Sino-Japanese Championship final in Yokohama, Japan, Japan still took the lead by one point in the last inning. After Mr. Liang repeatedly guided and supervised the battle, the Chinese team relied on the fighting spirit of the last minute to get a "full base hit" and reverse the defeat into victory. Therefore, Mr. Liang said that whether a ball game can be won depends on whether there is a fighting spirit, and the ball skills are secondary. Therefore, the teams he guides are calm in the face of battle. For example, when the Panda team was fighting, Liang Yousheng was the pitcher. Because of leg cramps, coach Liang still did not allow anyone to replace him. Once, the catcher's face was injured, but he was still not allowed to leave the field. He had to fight to the end, fearing that it would shake the single-mindedness and lead to a defeat. Mr. Liang's emphasis on fighting spirit is also evident in Hong Kong. The local Western newspaper called Mr. Liang "Grandpa Liang." (Graudpa Liang) Because every time during a game, Liang Ruo would be present to supervise the battle, exhorting and guiding them, just like an old man's teaching.

The Pandas will fight the Japanese on the afternoon of July 4

Next Thursday (July 5), at 4:30 PM at the Russian Sports Association Stadium on Xiafei Road, Pan Sheng Road (Wuxing Road), the Pandas will face the strongest Japanese team in this year's league. This battle is related to the future championship, and the skills of the two teams are equal. According to Mr. Liang's observation, the Japanese team's offense is better than its defense, such as the left-handed hitter 岛 and Miura. Nogami. Suro are all good at hitting. These Japanese players who studied in the United States have the same style as the Americans, and their actions are smooth and their English is fluent. Now Mr. Liang knows that the Japanese team knows how to be careful to prevent the Chinese team from using short hits, so they will change their tactics. Both sides will do their best in this battle. This international ball game is free of charge and will attract a large number of fans. Before the game, the Panda B team will compete with the Soviet team starting at 3:00 PM. The strength of these two teams is also very strong, and there will also be a fierce battle.

### My Views on the Revision of Round Gate Ball Rules (Part Two)

— Di Xianzhang

According to Chapter Nine, "Game Terminology and Explanations," there are only twenty-one items listed. However, if the attacking team's forward dribbles the ball into the opponent's zone and attacks the goal, but the defending team's defender uses legitimate defensive techniques to prevent a close attack, in several previous games, the attacking team's forward often used quick running movements to throw the ball back to their own zone. This caused the defending team's forwards and defenders to tire from running, ultimately achieving the completion of the attack. This technique, when used between teams of comparable strength, can lead to frequent exciting plays. Unfortunately, when there is a slight disparity in the strength of the two teams, it easily creates a situation of "superior strategy" and "being tied hand and foot." As a result, the winner becomes even stronger, and the loser becomes even more discouraged, leading to unequal benefits. Therefore, it is stipulated that "after the attacking team enters the opponent's zone, they must not retreat to their own backcourt before shooting," and the penalty rules are as follows: "Retreating to the backcourt results in a dead ball, and a player from the opposing team throws the ball into the field near the sideline where the ball landed in the backcourt to continue the game." However, if the opposing team's player gains possession of the ball when it lands in the backcourt, it is not considered a retreat to the backcourt.

Holding the Ball for Three Seconds

This violation is adapted from American basketball rules, with modifications. An attacking team player, whether in their own zone or the opponent's zone, must not hold the ball motionless for three seconds. Otherwise, at the nearest sideline outside the area where the violation occurred, a player from the opposing team throws the ball into the field to continue the game. This rule was introduced because, during an attack, the attacking team would suddenly stop, wait for the defending team's players to take their positions, and then suddenly continue the attack, catching the defending team off guard and putting them in a virtually impossible situation. This technique was especially common when the score was tied. Therefore, the violation of holding the ball for one second was specified.

Two-Handed Dribbling

In the original rules, Chapter Nine, "Game Terminology and Explanations," item seventeen, "Returning the Ball," states: "After a player gains possession of the ball, throwing, dribbling, or rolling the ball, touching the ball again before it is touched by a second person is called dribbling." Although it does not explicitly state whether to use one hand or two, in practice, except for bouncing the ball, whether dribbling or rolling, one hand is always used. Using two hands is, in effect, a violation. Furthermore, dribbling simultaneously or alternating hands while dribbling is also a violation. The penalty is the same as in basketball.

The above four items have all been corrected, and all team players participating in the cup competition should be familiar with them. The following items are merely my personal opinions. Whether they are appropriate or not, I hope that the knowledgeable readers, referees, and senior figures will provide corrections. I would be most grateful!

Various ball games are often divided into A and B groups based on physical strength so that the exercise can fully showcase skills without harming health. In past round gate ball competitions, the size of the field and the number of players on the field were the same for both A and B groups in the men's division. However, in my opinion, A-group players are fully developed and physically strong. According to Mr. Qian's specified rule, Chapter One, "Field," note three, which states: "The area of a large field and the number of players in the game are the same as in soccer," then the A-group teams should use a soccer field and the number of soccer players. I imagine this would lead to many more exciting plays. B-group players are not fully developed, or even if they are, their skills are inferior. Therefore, they should use a smaller soccer field and the number of players on that field. In the women's division, physiological conditions do not allow for excessively strenuous exercise. Therefore, I advocate adopting the Qian Wei zone system, where the forwards are always in the opposing zone and cannot enter their own zone (except during the kickoff), and the three defenders are always in their own zone and cannot enter the opposing zone. This is the same as the rules for women's basketball. As for other rules, many more should be adopted from women's basketball rules to make them physiologically suitable. The size of the field should be the same as that for small rubber balls. This is the first point.

Game Time

In the original rules, the actual playing time for men's games is stipulated as forty minutes, with the entire game divided into two halves, each half being twenty minutes, with a ten-minute break between the two halves. For women and junior high school students, the total game time should be changed to thirty-two minutes, with each half being sixteen minutes, with a ten-minute break between the two halves. In my opinion, following the original text for the Shenbao players, the B-group players should change to two halves, each half further divided into two quarters, each quarter being ten minutes, with a five-minute break between the two quarters. For women and junior high school students, it should also be divided into four quarters, each quarter being eight minutes, with a three-minute break between the first and second quarters, and another three-minute break between the third and fourth quarters, with a ten-minute break between the two halves. This is the second point. (End)
