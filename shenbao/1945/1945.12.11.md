### National Army Fully Equipped and Ready to Fly to Changchun, Shenyang Lights Clearly Visible, Northeast Headquarters Determined to Advance

[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 10th Dispatch] If the Changchun negotiations proceed smoothly, the National Army scheduled for airlift will depart in the air on some clear morning soon. They have all been weighed and are eager to fly. The plan to airlift to Shenyang has been cancelled because the National Army has already reached Xinggutun Station, the lights of Shenyang are clearly visible, and the Beining Road is open to Harbin, so it is no longer necessary. Zhang Xueshi's troops in Shenyang have been driven back by the Soviet army, and there have been clashes with considerable casualties in Zhang's unit.

[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 10th Dispatch] The Northeast takeover issue is still in the stage of consultation and preparation. Director of the Northeast Headquarters, Xiong Shihui, is now in Beiping, quietly awaiting Zhang Jia'ao and Jiang Jingguo's negotiation results in Changchun and is urging his subordinates to strengthen preparatory work. The Northeast Headquarters was moved from Changchun to Beiping, but it is now heard that it has been decided to advance forward, perhaps temporarily setting up in the Shanhaiguan area. The political lineup of the Northeast Headquarters is also gradually strengthening. Wan Fulin, a member of the Political Committee, arrived in Beiping from Chongqing the day before yesterday. There are still vacancies on the committee. Zhang Zuoxiang, a senior member of the former Northeast Army, now retired in Tianjin, may be invited to assist in the work of the Headquarters.

### After Requesting Instructions from Du Yuming, Flew Back to Beiping from Chongqing Yesterday

[Our Report] According to a Washington broadcast on the 10th: According to reliable sources, Chinese troops are expected to enter Shenyang within a few days. Currently, Soviet troops are responsible for all security work but will withdraw after the Chinese army enters.

[Central News Agency, Beiping, 10th Dispatch] Du Yuming took off from Chongqing at 10:00 AM on the 10th and arrived in Beiping at 4:30 PM. He immediately called on Xiong Shihui for instructions and visited Li Zongren and Xu Xiaoyan. In the evening, he had a long discussion with the heads of the northeastern provinces remaining in Beiping. On the morning of the 11th, after addressing the officers and soldiers planning to be airlifted to Changchun, he flew directly to Jinzhou. Du said: The National Army has now advanced to Miaojia Wopu, twenty miles north of Goubangzi. All Northeast takeover work will be carried out in accordance with the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance. The legal tender currency is absolutely prohibited in the Northeast. Before the government-stipulated Northeast circulation currency is used, the legal tender used by the National Army, regardless of large or small denominations, must be stamped before it can be used. Moreover, the stamped legal tender is limited to being issued to officers and soldiers and is limited to one month's salary per person. Illegal merchants attempting to profit will be strictly prohibited.

[United Press, Chongqing, 10th Dispatch] General Du Yuming flew back to Jinzhou today after calling on Chairman Chiang. Du said: As a result of the general election, county magistrates have been restored in six areas. The 50,000-spindle textile mill and flour mill in Jinzhou have also resumed operations. There were originally five Japanese airfields in the Northeast, all of which have now been recovered. To solicit the Central Government's order to exempt grain taxes, Du ordered that local taxes be waived for one year to relieve the people's hardships. Since arriving here last Friday, Du had three audiences with Chairman Chiang to request instructions on Northeast affairs, and he also met with Minister of Military Administration Chen Cheng and President of the Executive Yuan, Song Ziwen. Before leaving Chongqing, he stated at a press reception that the international situation had improved since the Three Foreign Ministers Conference was announced. Therefore, the takeover of the Northeast is easier.

[Associated Press, Chongqing, 10th Dispatch] The vanguard of the National Army is now in the suburbs, awaiting orders to enter the city. It was previously rumored that the troops of Zhang Xueliang's younger brother, Zhang Xueshi, had moved into the city to "welcome" the National Army, but these people are still colluding with the Chinese Communist Party.

### Agreement Reached in Changchun Negotiations, Airlift Could Transport One Division in Ten Days if it Begins, Local Residents Actively Preparing to Welcome

[Central News Agency Reporter Liu Zhuozhou, Changchun, 10th Dispatch] Here, the talks between Chinese and Soviet officials regarding the airlift of the National Army to Changchun and the takeover of various departments have now come to a satisfactory conclusion. After Zhang Jia'ao and Jiang Jingguo returned here, they had long talks with Marshal Malinovskiy twice and also had several contacts with the heads of various Soviet departments. According to Jiang Jingguo, who told reporters today: all the meetings were conducted in accordance with the principles of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance. At 1:00 PM today, Jiang accompanied Li Zefen, commander of the division who came here from Beiping yesterday, to visit General Kalov, commander of the Soviet area, for a friendly meeting. Commander Li inspected the future stationing locations of his troops this morning. These stationing locations are mostly high-rise buildings in key locations. The barracks built by the former puppet regime are desolate and need to be repaired before they can be used. Although the date of arrival of our airlifted troops has not been announced, local residents have a premonition and are actively preparing to welcome them. According to current information, once the airlift begins, one division of troops can be transported in a week, or at most ten days. The provocative slogans on the streets have all faded, and the new slogans welcoming the National Army and opposing incitement are bright and eye-catching. Today, the sky here is clear with flying snow, the snowflakes are as fine as dust, reflecting the sunlight. Personnel returning from the headquarters, in the crisp cold wind and the sound of horses' hooves, are greeted with smiling faces and overflowing enthusiasm by the citizens, dispelling the feeling of shrinking from the severe winter. Administrative takeover work can be started at any time. According to reliable information: our side will first take over Changchun, Harbin, and Shenyang and other cities. It is heard that the takeover personnel from various provinces and cities staying in Beiping will come to Changchun soon.

[Central News Agency Reporter Liu Zhuozhou, Changchun, 9th Dispatch] Personnel of the Northeast Headquarters are returning here from Beiping one after another, and the Mantan Building is becoming active again. At the lowest point, the Headquarters personnel only had one table of food per meal, but now it has gradually increased to six tables. The Hai Shang Building, where the Political and Economic Committees used to reside, is still under custody. The building was forcibly occupied by miscellaneous troops for three days last month, on the 17th, 18th, and 19th. On the 20th, they were driven out by the Soviet army. Currently, the Headquarters and the Hai Shang Building are guarded by the Soviet army together with the local police. These police were once disarmed, but have now been re-armed. There are no other armed forces in the city except the Soviet army and the police. Social order is generally peaceful, and gunshots are no longer heard at night, but there are still few pedestrians after dark. After the Changchun Railway was opened to traffic, the passengers were very crowded and felt safe. Cities such as Harbin, Shenyang, and Dalian are now more prosperous than here. The Industrial University run by the Changchun Railway has opened classes in Harbin, and Zhang Jia'ao specially sent Zhu Xinmin, director of the personnel department of the Railway, to represent him at the opening ceremony. Zhang Peizhe, the railway police supervisor, is scheduled to go to Shenyang and Dalian on the 10th to inspect for four days. The railway personnel who came to Changchun with Zhang Jia'ao have all started working. Chinese and Soviet employees get along quite harmoniously. The current director of the Changchun Public Security Bureau is Liu Zhige, who has only been in office for a short time, and his work is quite good. There are five newspapers here, all of which were published in the last three weeks. Their content is more commentary than reporting, and more reprinted articles than special features.

### Strange Fires in Two Places in Beiping, Airport and North China Daily

[Associated Press, Beiping, 10th Dispatch] Two major fires occurred here last night, one at the airport in the western suburbs and one at the North China Daily newspaper office. The cause of the fires is unknown. No American personnel at the airport were injured. The military air traffic control personnel on duty escaped moments before the two-story building collapsed. Sophisticated radio equipment for the army and navy, worth over one million US dollars, and various flight records were all destroyed. The fire at the North China Daily started at midnight, about the time the airport fire started. Military and political authorities here are investigating today whether someone committed arson.

[Reuters, Beiping, 10th Dispatch] US Marine Corps officers said today that six US aircraft that departed from Qingdao on Saturday for a demonstration flight over the Tianjin area have not returned and are presumed to have crashed.

[Associated Press, Tianjin, 10th Dispatch] An unarmed American soldier was shot and severely wounded in the face by three people while riding a horse near the racetrack in the suburbs yesterday afternoon.

### President Song Will Come to Shanghai and Then to Nanjing to Preside Over the First Executive Yuan Meeting After the Return of the Capital

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 10th Dispatch] President of the Executive Yuan, Song Ziwen, is scheduled to fly to Shanghai from Chongqing on the 13th, and then return to the capital to preside over the first meeting of the Executive Yuan after the return of the capital. This meeting is scheduled to be held in Nanjing on the 18th. The heads of all ministries and commissions under the Executive Yuan have now decided to return to Nanjing before the meeting. The former Ministry of Railways, which was decided to be used as the joint office of various ministries and commissions of the Executive Yuan, is not sufficient for use. The plan is now being changed, and the agencies that have taken over the former puppet ministries and commissions will use those sites as offices. The Ministries of Transportation, Agriculture and Forestry, and Food, and the Executive Yuan will be located at the former site of the Ministry of Railways. The Ministry of Social Affairs, the Land Administration, the Water Conservancy Commission, and the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission will be located at the former site of the Executive Yuan. Furthermore, the directors of all departments of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the personnel returning to the capital have decided to return to Nanjing before the middle of the month. The date of Minister Wang Shijie's return has not yet been determined.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 10th Dispatch] The first batch of personnel returning to the capital from various agencies, over 200 people, arrived in Nanjing by China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC) aircraft on the 9th and 10th. The Ministry of Transportation, the Ministry of Food, and the National Resources Commission had the largest number of personnel. Furthermore, the first batch of 89 UNRRA personnel arriving in Nanjing have all arrived and will work actively with the UNRRA office in Shanghai to carry out relief work in the recovered areas.

### Kunming Student Unrest Not Adequately Prevented, Guan Linzheng Requests Punishment, Chairman Chiang Approves Dismissal for Deliberation, Orders Huo Kuizhang to Temporarily Act as Garrison Commander

[Our Newspaper, Chongqing, 10th Dispatch] Yunnan Garrison Commander General Guan Linzheng called on Chairman Chiang yesterday, pleaded guilty and resigned, requesting punishment. It is said that he is willing to take full responsibility for the fact that four students were killed in the recent student demonstration due to someone throwing hand grenades.

[Our Newspaper, Kunming, 9th Dispatch] The confessions of the grenade-throwing criminals from the National Southwestern Associated University (聯大) Normal College and the relevant case files have all been sent to Chongqing and submitted to the highest authorities for review. The legal committee organized by the professors of the National Southwestern Associated University has requested the Garrison Headquarters to transfer the criminals Chen Qida and Liu Youzhi to the local court for public trial because they are not active-duty soldiers. As of the 9th, the students of the National Southwestern Associated University had raised over 15 million yuan for the sacrificed students. When the deceased students were buried on the 9th, the students of the National Southwestern Associated University sent them off with a "silent march," and no incidents occurred.

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 10th Dispatch] Yunnan Garrison Commander Guan Linzheng sent a telegram to Chairman Chiang on the 7th to request punishment for the Kunming student unrest, and reported to Chongqing on the 9th. It is now known that Chairman Chiang believes that although the brewing and expansion of this student unrest was instigated by someone, Garrison Commander Guan is responsible for local security and was ultimately inadequate in preventing it, resulting in casualties among the students. He has ordered Guan to be suspended from his post, pending deliberation. Huo Kuizhang has been ordered to temporarily act as the Garrison Commander. The original text of the telegram submitted by Garrison Commander Guan is recorded below: Since the outbreak of the Kunming student unrest, I have been deeply aware that someone is manipulating it, containing a political conspiracy. Therefore, I have been cautious and vigilant at all times, carefully handling the matter in accordance with your instructions, and dare not neglect it. However, the brawl between the Faculty of Arts and Law of the National Southwestern Associated University and the Second General Team of Officers and the tragedy at the National Southwestern Associated University Normal College arose suddenly one day. I have exhausted all kinds of methods to seek stability, arrest the criminals, and comfort the victims. I have spared no effort in doing everything that I should do in my position. Now, the grenade-throwing criminals Chen Qida and Liu Youzhi have both been arrested and publicly interrogated. According to their confessions, they were indeed instigated by the reactionary element Jiang Kai, and the weapon was also given to them by Jiang. The situation is clear, and the student unrest should come to an end. However, the reactionary conspirators will never be satisfied with this and are afraid that they will continue to use young people as tools to achieve their conspiracy to disrupt society and incite people's hearts. As I am responsible for local security, I did not adequately prevent it in advance, resulting in the deaths of four beloved young people and injuries to more than ten. I should bear full responsibility for all of this. I propose that I be dismissed first and punished according to law in order to comfort the hearts of the deceased students and to serve as a warning to those who fail in their duties. I respectfully request your review, Guan Linzheng kowtows.

### Zhou Enlai Will Go to Chongqing Soon, Accompanied by Communist Party Representatives

[Associated Press, Yan'an, 9th Dispatch] The Communist Party authorities announced that Zhou Enlai will go to Chongqing "around the 10th of this month" with other Communist Party representatives to the Political Consultative Conference.

The seven candidates for the Communist Party representatives attending the Political Consultative Conference have not been fully determined. Ye Jianying has agreed to serve as Chairman of the Military Subcommittee to handle the reorganization and allocation of the Communist Army.

### Kunming's Atmosphere is Bleak, Returning Home Street Vendors Gradually Decreasing

[Our Newspaper, Kunming, 9th Dispatch] The ancient city of Dianhai, which was once the center of the Allied forces and showed abnormal prosperity, is now showing a declining atmosphere due to the relocation of American troops and the return of wealthy outsiders. American soldiers in khaki uniforms have almost disappeared from the streets, and the number of jeeps speeding through the main roads has also decreased. Many of the cafes that used to cater to the Allied forces have been converted into teahouses or dance halls. The barracks and reception centers near the airport are empty, and the scene is completely different. According to a survey, at its peak, the number of American troops reached over 30,000, but now it is feared that it is less than 100 or 200. Since November 28th, the special trains for righteous people returning home from Kunming have run a total of 30+ trains, transporting 905 people. Among them, 429 are from Hunan Province, 197 from Jiangsu Province, 105 from Guangdong and Guangxi Provinces, 60 from Zhejiang Province, 15 from Jiangxi Province, and 60 from Hebei, Shandong, Henan, Shanxi, Rehe, and the nine northeastern provinces. In addition, there are quite a few people from other provinces who are returning home. However, due to the fact that the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway has not yet been repaired, and the vehicles on the Sichuan-Yunnan Road are not sufficient, the number of people leaving the country is limited. According to statistics from the municipal government, as of November 30th, the population of Kunming City was 283,426, with 818 more women than men. As for the floating population, 13,542 people registered in November. The number of "returning home street vendors" has gradually decreased recently, and the reasons are roughly five: (1) People from the Jiangnan region have difficulty with transportation back home; (2) People from the north still feel that their return home is indefinite; (3) Prices in the recovered areas have risen sharply; (4) The weather in Kunming is getting colder; (5) There are frequent bandit attacks along the various highways, and it is approaching the end of the year, so travelers are reluctant to travel.

### Fierce Fighting in Lincheng and Zaozhuang, Part of the Communist Army Encircled the Northeast of Xiangfan, Sui-Bao Railway Continues to be Damaged, Communist Army in Hebei Harasses

[Central News Agency, Jinan, 10th Dispatch] The Communist Army's attacks on the Lincheng and Zaozhuang areas have been extremely fierce, and the National Army is resisting strongly. The Tianjin-Pukou and Jiaoji Railways are being damaged and repaired almost every day and have not yet been opened to traffic.

[Central News Agency, Luohe, 10th Dispatch] (1) 7,000-8,000 Communist troops began to encircle Shuanggou, 45 kilometers northeast of Xiangfan, on the evening of the 7th, and there were still more than 3,000 follow-up troops. (2) On the road from Taiping Town, 60 miles north of Zaoyang, to Yangjia Dang, more than 2,000 Communist troops were found on the 8th, harassing westward and southward.

[Central News Agency, Xi'an, 9th Dispatch] A fierce artillery battle took place in the suburbs of Guisui City on the morning of the 9th, lasting for an hour before it subsided. The Communist Army has been destroying the railway between Guisui and Baotou in recent days. From Zitah, the first station east of Guisui, to Taobuqi, the destruction has been thorough. Those who heard and saw the sound of the explosions and the intensity of the fire were all heartbroken. In recent days, wealthy households and merchants in eastern Sui have been increasingly killed by the Communist Army. An Yonghu, a wealthy household in Jining County, committed suicide with three members of his family at the same time because all of his family property was confiscated.

[Central News Agency, Tianjin, 9th Dispatch] The Communist Army in Wenan, Piyi, Guan, Yongqing, Anci, Wuqing, Daxing, Wanping and other counties in central Hebei is now harassing in separate routes. One route seems to be aimed at eastern Hebei, and the other is heading north to Miyun Prefecture, seemingly aimed at Zhangjiakou. Wherever they pass, the people cannot bear the disturbance. Furthermore, it is heard that some Communist soldiers have deeply realized their past mistakes and have surrendered to the National Army with their weapons.

### Arresting Traitors in Shandong and Zhejiang

[Central News Agency, Jinan, 10th Dispatch] Miao Lanting, the chairman of the Jinan Chamber of Commerce during the puppet regime era, was recently arrested by the authorities and is the first Jinan traitor to be arrested.

[Central News Agency, Hangzhou, 9th Dispatch] Ni Ying, the executive member and secretary-general of the puppet Hangzhou Municipal Party Committee, was captured by the Chongde County Government on the afternoon of the 5th and has been escorted to Hangzhou.

### Beiping Municipality Uses the Property of Traitors to Fund the Opening of Factories

[Central News Agency, Beiping, 10th Dispatch] Xu Huidong, the chairman of the Beiping Party Headquarters, said regarding the handling of traitors' property that the government has long had a plan for dealing with the property of traitors, which will be based on the principles of fairness, openness, and speed. He hoped that what was plundered from the people would be used for the people, so the property of traitors could be transferred to be used as the opening expenses of various factories, so that the factories could be opened as soon as possible.

### Kazakh Representatives Return to Yili, Negotiations in Dihua Reach a Stalemate

[Associated Press, Chongqing, 10th Dispatch] A local newspaper here reported that negotiations with the Kazakhs aimed at bringing Xinjiang under the peaceful governance of the central government have reached a stalemate. The Kazakh representatives have left Dihua, and there have been no further talks between the two sides in the past two weeks. It is reported that the Kazakh side has made the following demands to General Zhang Zhizhong, the government representative: (1) All Kazakh officials must be elected by the people; (2) Freedom of religion must be guaranteed; (3) Kazakh language must be used in official documents; (4) Kazakh language must also be used in books; (5) Local art and culture must be given full freedom to develop; (6) Freedom of speech and the press must be guaranteed; (7) Taxes must have a certain limit; (8) Trade must be unrestricted; (9) The government must recognize the Kazakh National Army, and its commander must still be a Kazakh; (10) Kazakhs must have broad opportunities to participate in the provincial government; (11) The government should forgive and not punish the leaders responsible for past Kazakh attacks on the National Army; (12) Kazakh prisoners of war must be released. It is said that Zhang firmly rejected the ninth demand, arguing that an independent army detached from the government could not be tolerated on Chinese territory. He insisted that the Kazakh army must be reorganized into a "security" force, and the commander would be appointed by the government. The number of people in this security force must be restricted by law. In addition, it is said that Zhang also revised five other demands. He said that county magistrates could be elected by the people, but senior officials must be appointed by the government. Documents and books must be in Chinese, but they are allowed to have Kazakh translations attached. As for trade, Xinjiang's foreign trade should be controlled by the government, but domestic trade within the province can be allowed to be free. The newspaper reported that the Kazakh representatives were not satisfied with Zhang's reply and have returned to their base in Yili, on the Xinjiang-Soviet border.

### Investigation of the Pearl Harbor Incident Continues, Marshall Postpones Departure, US Senate Foreign Relations Committee to Draft a Work Summary

[Associated Press, Washington, 10th Dispatch] The new US Ambassador to China, Marshall, was originally scheduled to fly to Chongqing on Saturday night to take office. However, Senator Morse, a member of the Congressional Committee investigating the Pearl Harbor attack, requested to continue questioning him, so Marshall temporarily postponed his departure.

[Associated Press, Washington, 9th Dispatch] US Secretary of State Byrnes told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that US policy toward China is to seek China's unification and democracy so that all opposing factions can cooperate sincerely. He also said: "We have long believed, and have constantly stated, that the National Government led by Chairman Chiang is the most satisfactory basis for the development of democracy." He also said that solving this problem "is not easy." On the American side, "vigilance and prudence, patience and self-restraint," and on the Chinese side, leaders of all factions should also have these qualities. General Marshall will go to China to take office as Special Envoy in this atmosphere, and his task will be quite arduous. Even with Marshall's prudence, patience, and self-restraint, the trials he will encounter will probably be unprecedented since he took office as Chief of Staff of the Army. If Marshall can declare China's path to peaceful unification, then his talent as the world's greatest leader, as President Truman called him, will become even more apparent.

[Associated Press, Washington, 10th Dispatch] Washington authorities revealed that the State Department will have the Senate Foreign Relations Committee draft a summary of diplomatic work. It is understood that all review work has been completed, but today's speech has not been included. According to the plan, today's speech is perhaps the last one.

### Our London Correspondent: World Youth Congress

— Yu Feng

In London, one can see people of all kinds from the international community striving for lasting peace. Diplomats, educators, are gathered in London for meetings, and even young people who have not truly become part of any one group are no exception. Six hundred representatives of sixty million young people, waving the flags of sixty-three countries, are also holding the largest World Youth Congress in history at the Seymour Hall in London, during this period of lively international conferences.

On the first day (October 30th), the opening ceremony was held at Albert Hall, with representatives of each country following their own flag into the venue. A voice from the loudspeaker said, "We welcome China, who has resisted for eight years," and applause thundered. The flag of the Blue Sky, White Sun, and a Wholly Red Earth advanced, leading the twenty-five representatives behind it: twenty young men and five young women, representing six different youth groups – the Three Principles of the People Youth League, the Youth Writers Association, the Christian Student Movement, the Association of Chinese Students in the UK, the Young Men and Women's Association, and the Youth Association of the Liberated Areas of Yan'an.

Initially, when China received the notice of the meeting, it was too late. Calculating the time required for completing formalities and waiting for a plane, people from China would not be able to make it in time. Therefore, the Ministry of Education authorized the Chinese Embassy in the UK and Professor Chen Yuan, the representative of the Sino-British Cultural Association in the UK, to entrust them to find talent locally. Almost all of the representatives were already in the UK, except for Chen Jiakang, the representative of the Youth Association of the Liberated Areas of Yan'an, who specially came from the United States.

On the first day of the meeting, the Chinese representatives presented a banner and a commemorative album signed by tens of thousands of young people to the congress. The banner read: "Promote the power of youth unity, consolidate world lasting peace."

The major topics discussed at the congress were: (1) Youth fighting for freedom, (2) The needs of youth after the war, (3) International youth cooperation organizations. If the previous generation caused war because of poor cooperation, at least this generation of youth should cooperate and trust each other. Italy sent representatives to participate, and Germany also had youth present. Only the Japanese youth across the sea did not have the opportunity to witness the enthusiasm of this cooperation among young people from all over the world.

At the end of the opening ceremony on the first day, the national anthems of the United States, Britain, the Soviet Union, China, and France were sung in turn in the auditorium. During the closing election, the five countries of the United States, Britain, the Soviet Union, China, and France occupied five chair positions. It seemed that, although this was a gathering of pure youth, it had also cast some shadows of the consciousness of large and small countries. In fact, in the congress and group meetings, the speeches that won the most applause were still those of representatives from small countries. Miss Pengla, the representative from India, painfully recounted the suffering of the Indian people, attacking Britain relentlessly. Her speech was interrupted several times by applause. After finishing her speech and leaving the stage, she was surrounded by everyone.

In the painful speeches of the colonial representatives, one could truly hear the voices from the bottom of their young hearts. They were longing for everything that people had promised them. Perhaps the speech of a representative from Jamaica could express the grievances of all colonial peoples. He said, "We fought for freedom and democracy, sacrificing so many lives, but we ourselves have not seen freedom or democracy."

In the congress, there were various skin colors and various outfits. The cheongsam of the Chinese female representatives became the object of attention for general photographers. Several representatives from Outer Mongolia, who claimed to have "broken free from oppression," were dressed in bright colors, with wide edges rolled on the sleeves of their long robes, and were also the center of attention.

Differences in skin color and attire were naturally expected, only attracting attention and not surprising people. The most surprising thing was that in this World Youth Congress, one actually found representatives with long braids hanging down to their chests. There were even more with small mustaches. So a London newspaper simply felt that this was a "Peculiar Conference."

In the congress, languages were complex. English, French, Chinese, Russian, and Spanish were designated as official languages, and all reports had to be translated into five languages. The Chinese representatives could all speak and understand English. To save time, the Chinese representatives voluntarily requested to waive Chinese translation. But in the congress, in group meetings, one could still hear the Chinese voice. Chen Zhanxiang, the head of the Chinese delegation, a young engineer, started his speech in Chinese, saying, "To save time, I will speak directly in English." Then he switched tongues and spoke in English, confusing the audience below, who did not know what he was saying before the speech, causing a burst of laughter.

The Soviet delegation was the largest. There were twenty-five from the Soviet Union itself, and including Ukraine and others, there were a total of sixty to seventy people. They were most welcome when they entered the venue, with applause shaking the earth, and almost all the representatives stood up. Originally, there was a saying that this congress was left-leaning. It is said that when the Conservative Party was in power, it did not allow it to be held in the UK. The ban was only lifted after the Labour Party came to power.

Tracing back to this meeting, its predecessor was the International Youth Council. In 1941, a group of exiled foreign youth in Britain, probably from thirty countries, formed this International Youth Council. Being in a foreign country, they felt an even greater need for youth encouragement, assistance, and sympathy. The following year, in November, the council convened an international youth conference, which was attended by youth from various countries in the UK due to transportation difficulties at the time. Only the United States and the Soviet Union sent representatives from their countries to the UK. At that congress, the World Youth Council was established, and this World Youth Council convened this World Youth Congress. After this congress, a council was elected, and the council elected an executive committee. The executive committee had one chairman and four vice-chairmen. The chairman elected this time was French, and Chen Zhanxiang, the head of our delegation, was elected as one of the four vice-chairmen. It was decided that in the future, the name would be changed to the World Federation of Democratic Youth, and the address would be in Paris.

The meeting lasted for a total of ten days. During these ten days, the youth representatives also had social engagements, but they were informal. There was no formality, no ostentation. A dish of food, a glass of wine, only expressed the sincerity of communication between young people. At the lunch table every day, there were always several foreign youth representatives sitting with the Chinese representatives. Chinese food has long been famous internationally. Upon meeting, some representatives would directly say that they wanted to eat Chinese food. To the Chinese, the Chinese food in London has really lost its Chinese flavor, but to foreigners, the bowls and chopsticks have already made them feel novel, and tofu is even more unseen, and they eat it with relish.

There were a lot of promotional materials at the venue. Each representative received at least enough books to fill a bookshelf, with the most being in Russian, and the most exquisite and beautiful printing. There were also a lot of Soviet photos posted on the four walls of the venue. They believe in the principle of "prepare for all things in advance," and are fully prepared for any international conference. In a hurry, the Chinese representatives also wrote a small English booklet "Chinese Youth in the War of Resistance." The 500 copies of "Eight Years of Resistance" from the Information Department of the Central Committee in the UK also helped a bit. At least we also had some materials that could be used for people to understand. After they were distributed, people even came to ask for more.

On the closing day, at the entrance of the venue, I received one last leaflet, which read: "After the meeting, you all have homes to return to. Where is the home of the Jews? We accuse your conscience, please help us establish a Jewish state in Palestine!" Sent from London on November 13th.

### Byrnes Flies to Moscow To Discuss Tripartite Cooperation; Atomic Energy Still Central Focus

[Report from this Newspaper] According to Washington Radio broadcast on the 10th: Byrnes will fly by special plane to Moscow on Wednesday to participate in the Three-Power Foreign Ministers meeting to be convened on the 15th, to discuss international cooperation issues with Britain and the Soviet Union. Experts on European issues, Balkan issues, and the Director of the Far Eastern Department, Van Der, will accompany him. Whether the United States will compromise with the Soviet Union on the atomic energy issue will depend on the atmosphere of the meeting. Alsop, representing Byrnes, will go to Europe to investigate the political situation in Romania and Bulgaria, which is also significantly related to the future of the meeting. General de Gaulle is scheduled to deliver a radio address on the 10th, stating France's position on the Three-Power Conference. The Iranian Ambassador to the United States will pay a visit to Byrnes, requesting that the United States not take any steps that would undermine the integrity of Iranian territory. There is hope here that the Moscow meeting can conclude in time so that the three foreign ministers can jointly attend the United Nations General Assembly in London.

[Reuters, Washington, 10th] Senior diplomatic officials here declare that the "____" situation in US-Soviet-British relations will end with the holding of the Three-Power Foreign Ministers meeting. The inability of the three powers to cooperate sincerely has reached the point of harming the effectiveness of the United Nations organization. If the major powers still cannot attend with goodwill and understanding to address their various issues and fulfill their various aspirations, then the United Nations organization will inevitably be reduced to a vent for mutual disputes. The agenda includes: (1) Control of atomic energy, (2) Relations between the major powers in Eastern and Central Europe, (3) Issues concerning the United Nations trusteeship system and joint management of Japan by the United Nations, (4) The United Nations trusteeship system in other places and the same issues already within the United Nations organization.

### Editorial: Ritual and the New Life

China has established itself as a nation founded on ritual propriety and deference, and has been praised by distant lands. In ancient times, when observing a nation, one would first observe its rituals; thus, Lu, by upholding ritual propriety, was able to survive longer. But as it stands now, the exemplary models of our predecessors are nowhere to be found. Human desires prevail, and people run amok like startled beasts. Gradually, a noisy marketplace has formed, with hundreds and thousands gathering in groups, insulting and disrespecting allies, and losing all sense of decency. Prior restraint is impossible, and subsequent containment is unfeasible. Matters of discipline and control are casually dismissed without discussion or consideration. How can a nation of ritual propriety and deference be so lacking in these virtues to such an extent!

Why did China establish itself as a nation based on ritual propriety? Few people understand the reason. Let me explain. People are born with the capacity for contention, and contention inevitably leads to disorder. Disorder is punished, which is called punishment (刑). The sages believed that punishment alone could not govern people. They thought about guiding and regulating behavior before it manifested, and thus ritual (禮) was born. Therefore, ritual is the counterpart of punishment. The state establishes both ritual and punishment, and the two are fundamentally related in cause and effect, with their efficacy depending on mutual influence and adjustment. Confucius said, "If ritual and music do not flourish, then punishments will not be appropriate." To speak of punishment without ritual is nonsensical. In ancient times, there were three hundred major rituals and three thousand minor ones, and there were also three hundred major punishments and three thousand minor laws. Ritual prevents people from doing wrong before it happens, while punishment deals with those who have already transgressed. The principle is consistent, and the government operates on two pillars. Wang Chong explained this clearly in his "Lunheng." Ritual is the key to governing a country, and that is the rationale.

Since the rise of the Legalists, there has been a gradual desire to diminish ritual and emphasize punishment. However, when speaking of punishment, they ultimately could not abandon the name of ritual. It was therefore called "criminal law" (刑名). It must be understood that the existence of a name cannot be divorced from ritual. The saying of Confucius, quoted above, that "if ritual and music do not flourish, punishments will not be appropriate," ultimately returns to the idea of rectifying names and conforming to words. The Confucian and Legalist schools were not originally opposed. However, the Confucians adhered to ritual and leaned towards names, while the Legalists emphasized punishment and leaned towards law. As the sources diverged, they became opposing factions. Gu Yanwu said: "The Han people governed by names, so there were many talented people; today, people govern by law, so there is a decline in talent." This is no small matter related to the way of governance.

Some combine ritual, righteousness, integrity, and shame, calling them the Four Cardinal Virtues. This saying originated with Guan Zhong. Liu Zongyuan once argued that this was not said by Guan Zhong, saying that integrity means not seeking ill-gotten gains, and shame means being ashamed of following what is wrong. This is what is called righteousness, and cannot be combined with integrity and shame to form the Four Cardinal Virtues. I believe that Liu Zongyuan's interpretation of integrity and shame is skewed towards the negative. Adding to this the fact that ritual restrains people before they act, and righteousness prohibits people from doing wrong (from the "Commentary on the Appended Phrases" of the Book of Changes), the negative aspects of the four are equal. Moreover, Guan Zhong clearly stated that ritual does not exceed the proper bounds, righteousness does not advance oneself, integrity does not conceal evil, and shame does not follow wrongdoing. Doesn't the clear opposition of these four "not" words make them the opposite? (See the "Pastoral Administration" chapter.) Today, people misunderstand progress, emphasizing the positive, disregarding minor virtues, and valuing rights as if they were life itself. The Four Cardinal Virtues have been abandoned, and we have returned to the primitive ways of savage competition. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek is concerned about this. Ten years ago, he initiated the New Life Movement, reiterating the sayings of the minister of Qi, aiming to make the Four Cardinal Virtues the national policy. Unfortunately, the speakers were earnest, but the listeners were indifferent. Those who implemented it did not necessarily understand the meaning deeply, inevitably engaging in perfunctory actions. The grand proclamation was treated as mere paperwork. Since the founding of the nation, the most meaningful teachings the country has recognized have yielded such contradictory results. How lamentable!

Some question: The Four Cardinal Virtues are an outdated theory from two thousand years ago. Why call it "new"? Let me answer: New and old are relative terms, not implying immutability. Human intelligence and abilities have not changed much between ancient and modern people. Social culture and institutions cannot be created from nothing. The reason why history is valuable, and culture is expected to be continuous, is nothing more than using the past as a mirror, and following the good and the strong. Now, the Four Cardinal Virtues have been abandoned for too long. The country's danger of decline and collapse is a matter of grave concern. Only someone who follows the example of the Constitution, re-examining old friendships, and bestowing them with a brand new banner and establishing it as a guiding principle for life and affairs. People in the world renew what they call new themselves. What the authorities approve, the subordinates dare to disapprove. The applause of the masses cannot withstand the mocking eyes of private residences. Finally, abandoning ritual, severing righteousness, lacking integrity, and being without shame are things that happen repeatedly. They betray the great plan of revitalization and disgrace the ancient country of sacred teachings. What can be done about this!

Some also question: Ritual and names are unique to China. Foreign countries do not have these, yet they are prosperous and strong. Why do we not avoid the trouble, but must imitate the ancients and engage in empty talk? Then let me clarify this with the case of England. The British govern by law, but do not understand the use of the law of honor, which is particularly profound. When Lloyd George was Chancellor of the Exchequer, Guglielmo Marconi, the Italian inventor of wireless telegraphy, sold his invention rights to Britain. Lloyd George, as the leader of the Liberal Party, secretly bought shares in the Marconi company, using his sons to provide party funds. Parliament was in uproar, and the law of honor was used to suppress him. Lloyd George was ashamed and never recovered. Also, the British Amari, as the Consul-General in Hankou, bought £500 worth of Marconi shares in the same case and was dismissed from his post. The fear of reputation in other countries is like this. But we are greedy and corrupt a hundred or a thousand times more and are not content. We should, on the contrary, be proud of our reputation.

Recently, after the recovery of Shanghai, the "Chongqing people" have been criticized by public opinion. Among them, social interactions are complicated, and things are becoming more and more elaborate. Inspector Cheng Zhongxing also spoke about this. In the past, Ouyang Xiu, when writing the History of the Five Dynasties, wrote in large characters at the end of the book: "If officials take everything and do everything, will the world not be in chaos?" I dare not say that the "Chongqing people" are all reaching the point of taking everything and doing everything, leading to chaos. However, if we clarify ritual and have propriety, and clarify names and have distinctions, we can guide them, and it will all be acceptable. I happened to encounter a recent event, and spontaneously had this thought, expressing it in this rant for the servants.

### Takeover Procedures Completed: Cotton Mills Resume Work One After Another; American Cotton Distributed to Various Mills After Arrival in Shanghai

[Report from Our Newspaper] Zhang Ziyi, special commissioner of the Wartime Production Bureau of the Ministry of Economic Affairs in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui, told our newspaper reporter yesterday: After the enemy-operated cotton mills were taken over by our side, they have resumed work one after another. As of yesterday, the number of spinning spindles in operation has reached 226,108, an increase of 40,000 spindles compared to the number in operation before the takeover.

Time Still Needed to Restore Production

At present, due to the lack of raw cotton materials, it is not easy to increase the production of the cotton mills for a while. In the heyday of the Japanese cotton mills, there were more than 1.3 million spindles. If we want to restore the pre-war production volume of the 24 mills that have been taken over, it may take a considerable period of time. Regarding supplementing raw cotton materials, the government has already formulated a plan. In the short term, American cotton may arrive in Shanghai one after another in order to distribute it to various mills. Mr. Zhang also said: In the past, the Japanese operated various industries in Shanghai, with the cotton mill industry being the largest in scale and having close ties with the entire Japanese distribution system. Currently, 500 major Japanese technicians have been hired in order to increase production.

Various Military Factories Converted and Resume Work

Regarding the issue of resuming work in the factories that have been taken over, Mr. Zhang told reporters: There are many difficulties. The main ones are that coal transportation cannot be smooth. In addition, during the transition period before the takeover, most of the Japanese factories automatically stopped work, and internal machines were moved away, and raw materials were leaked. At present, the main machines need to be repaired and supplemented, and a regular source of raw materials needs to be found. Secondly, most of the Japanese machine factories are small wartime military factories. These factories need to be converted before they can resume work. The Ministry of Economic Affairs has converted one of the military factories into a wire nail factory, and another factory has been converted into a factory manufacturing diesel engines. This kind of conversion work cannot be completed in a short period of time given the current lack of materials. The Ministry of Economic Affairs is currently advancing the resumption plan step by step under complex circumstances in order to restore the production volume before August 10 to the bare minimum.

### Customs Receives More Than 500 Warehouses

[Report from Our Newspaper] A senior official of the Customs told our newspaper reporter today: Since November 9, the Customs has been entrusted by the Shanghai District Enemy and Puppet Property Handling Bureau to take over various warehouses. As of now, the number of large and small warehouses that have been taken over is more than 500. The quantity of various materials stored in the warehouses is enormous. However, whether these materials will be auctioned off, sold at low prices, or disposed of in other ways in the future will all be decided by the Enemy and Puppet Property Handling Bureau.

Another Report: The Japanese staff who previously served in the Customs have now been dismissed. Sir Frederick Maze, the Inspector General of Customs, previously came to Shanghai from Chongqing and will return to Shanghai soon.

### Opening Additional Shipping Routes Between Shanghai and Fujian

The Shanghai Shipping Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Communications is now preparing to open additional shipping routes between Shanghai and Fujian in order to expand civil aviation. The route from Shanghai to Quanzhou will be operated by ships allocated by the state-run China Merchants Steam Navigation Company. The routes from Shanghai to Sandu Ao and Shatou will be operated by ships that the Bureau finds ways to dispatch. As for Xiamen, because the wind and waves in the harbor are too large, only large ships can operate, so it has not been possible to restore it temporarily.

### Ten Public Buses Operate in Nanshi Yesterday

[Report from Our Newspaper] The temporary transportation group of the Public Bus Preparation Committee of the Municipal Public Utilities Bureau held a tea party for reporters from various newspapers at 10:00 a.m. yesterday.

### Takeover Work Must Be Handled Properly: Peng Xuepei Reported Yesterday

The Shanghai District Enemy and Puppet Property Review Committee held a joint meeting of the review committee members and representatives of various receiving agencies at 3:30 p.m. yesterday in the conference room of the handling bureau. More than 20 representatives from various agencies attended. Director Peng Xuepei presided over the meeting and made a brief report, stating that in the future, an extremely clear and complete account must be compiled for the takeover work, so that accurate and comprehensive reports can be made internally and externally. This is the first important task after our victory, and it must be handled properly in order to make a fresh impression and show the spirit of the founding of the country. The important principles of the takeover have already been notified to all parties. Then, the representatives reported separately on the status of the takeover to date. Finally, Director Liu Gongyun answered various questions.

In order to review whether the expenditures of the various relevant agencies are in line with the needs, the Enemy and Puppet Property Handling Bureau has decided to establish an Expenditure Review Committee, appointing Zhang Eryun as the chairman and Feng Youzhen, Xu Yongzuo, Duanmu Kai, Cai Rudong, and Cao Zhenzhao as the five committee members.

### Flour Production Increases

The Sanxing Flour Mill and the Greater China Flour Mill, which have resumed production after being taken over by the Shanghai Grain Administration Commissioner's Office, can each produce 5,000 bags of flour per day, for a total of 10,000 bags. The total production volume of other commercial flour mills, such as Fuxin and Fufeng, is approximately 50,000 bags. Therefore, the total output of flour in this city is estimated to be approximately 60,000 bags per day.

### Small Restaurants Exempt from Feast Tax

The person in charge of the Shanghai Municipal Finance Bureau made a statement yesterday, stating that the Finance Bureau, in consideration of the hardship of merchants and residents in the recovered areas, has generously stipulated that the starting point for the feast tax is 1,000 yuan. In the past two months, various restaurants have failed to diligently collect the tax on behalf of the government, report and pay it truthfully, and have engaged in loopholes and avoidance, causing some legitimate restaurant merchants to be in a dilemma. After several considerations, the Finance Bureau, in order to take into account the daily diet of ordinary people and to strictly prevent schemes for personal gain and fraud, stipulates that small restaurants and small eateries that specialize in ordinary people's meals will be exempted from the tax in order to alleviate the hardships of the people. The rest will be taxed according to the prescribed tax rate. In this way, ordinary people will not be taxed regardless of how much they eat or drink.

### Looted Ancient Books Recovered

[Report from Our Newspaper] When the Jia Ye Tang Library of the Liu family in Nanxun was occupied by the enemy in western Zhejiang, some of the rare and valuable books in the country were transported to Suzhou and Shanghai. The part in Shanghai was stored in the residence of Liu Hanyi, the owner of Jia Ye Tang. In July of this year, it was suddenly coveted by Zhou Fohai, the "puppet mayor of Shanghai," who sent puppet troops to forcibly seize all the precious books, more than 100 boxes in total, and placed them in the Changming Clock Factory at 419 Jiaozhou Road. Recently, the police station seized them and sealed the books. Mr. Liu is currently trying to negotiate to recover them. It is reported that the Nanxun collection has not suffered much damage due to proper storage. However, the part stored in Suzhou was lost when Suzhou was occupied, which is very regrettable.

### Retrial of Traitor Zhou Yiwei

The Shanghai Office of the Navy Department hosted a press conference at 4:00 PM yesterday for the city's press. Director Lin Xiangxin, Navy Acquisition Director Wu Zhennan, and Deputy Director Chen Baofan of the Jiangnan Shipyard reported on the acquisition process. Director Lin's report mainly covered eight points: (1) Most of the warehouses have been handed over to Customs for acquisition. (2) Regarding materials acquired by the military, for proper safekeeping, materials scattered in remote locations were concentrated in the Yangshupu Public Grand Textile Factory warehouse and the Lan Road warehouse. (3) Regarding the transfer of ships, rosters were compiled and submitted to the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company for acquisition. As for foreign ships, the enemy had often altered their names and types, making immediate processing impossible; most have now been reclaimed. (4) For fuel and food consumed by the military, prior to the establishment of the Disposal Bureau, the military made emergency use of supplies, all with documented receipts for settlement. (5) The Navy only received 50 million yuan from Commander-in-Chief He for acquisition expenses, so it was necessary to temporarily use funds designated for urgent disposal of materials. (6) Regarding the disposal of perishable materials such as fresh fish and cured meats, as freezing resources were running out, the Disposal Bureau has been notified for record. (7) Leakage of materials was mainly due to the vastness of the area and limited troop strength, and some warehouses were of a temporary nature, hastily evacuated by the enemy, making security difficult, or were misappropriated by allied forces. (8) In general, the Navy's acquisition procedure involved first acquiring, sealing, and securing, then compiling rosters for inventory. After Director Lin's report, Wu Zhennan and Chen Baofan delivered speeches, clarifying misunderstandings and providing extensive explanations regarding the British recovery of the Union Naval Dockyards.

Cultivation

### The Life that Wins

— Yang Tongfang

Five or six years ago, I read a book by E. Alice called "The Victorious Life." The author was a professor at the University of Chicago in the United States, and his writings on life cultivation in various places have many unique insights. "The Victorious Life" covers many issues, including child education, society, family, religion, and career. From a psychological point of view, Alice uses the actual social situation to show us how we should strive on the diverse journey of life in order to achieve the road to success.

With the advent of the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, everyone feels the excitement and joy of victory. From now on, we can live the independent and autonomous life of a great nation. To transform from an unfree life to a bright and victorious life, is something worth celebrating and inspiring. But our eight years of hard anti-Japanese war was hard won, and although our international status has improved, we still have to go through a nation-building process that is even more difficult than the anti-Japanese war before we can reach the final goal.

In the future, the people of our country must meet this great era and share in this arduous task of nation-building. The most important thing is to enrich themselves, build themselves, refine themselves, educate themselves, and strive for victory and success in all aspects of life. We must start by improving our daily lives, eliminating all bad habits, correcting all distorted ideas, and cultivating lofty ideals for life and establishing a comprehensive attitude towards life. To be a "great national," to be a "victorious national" is not just a mere title. We must constantly reflect on our lives and examine our lives to see if we are worthy of "the life of a great national" and "the life of victory."

The great French thinker Romain Rolland said: "Life is a battle." These words are indeed a profound truth. Life is indeed a big battlefield. People living in today's society, unless they are resilient and conscious warriors, will be struck and submerged by the raging waves of the times. We must overcome all obstacles in life with a strong will. We cannot compromise with unhealthy and unreasonable lives, but must use the spirit of cutting through thorns and the determination of perseverance to eradicate all decadent, corrupt, complacent, and routine lives that stand in our way. Eliminating all the toxins in life can give us new vitality in life, and we can also win on the battlefield of life.

Here, I would like to offer two sentences from Alice in "The Life that Wins" to the people of the whole country: "The weak are always trapped in the dark side of life, only those who strive and progress can obtain a bright and victorious life!"

### Tiger Hunting

— Bao

Japanese war criminal "Tiger of Malaya" Tomoyuki Yamashita has been sentenced to hanging.

In addition to swatting flies and mosquitoes, the Americans have also spent a lot of effort in "hunting tigers" in punishing war criminals.

This is a good example for us to expose traitors and punish corrupt officials.

Let us hunt more tigers!

Aviation

### Today and Tomorrow of the Aircraft Industry

— Laoshen

What followed the end of the war was the reduction and suspension of military industries in various countries. The United States' massive aircraft industry has also been similarly affected. The production of the Boeing factory, which specializes in the B-29 superfortress, has been reduced month by month, from 122 to 10, and has been completely shut down this month. Of the 29,000 workers in the entire factory, 21,000 have been laid off, and the Army and Navy's contracts for 200 million yuan have been cancelled. During peacetime, there is a surplus of aircraft, and new aircraft are no longer being manufactured, but the factory has stocked enough raw materials for three months.

The Lockheed factory, which specializes in manufacturing P-38 fighter jets and P-59 jet aircraft, is in a similar situation. It is now planning to transform into a post-war civil aircraft manufacturer. The new trend in the American aircraft industry in the future will probably be towards large passenger aircraft. The Lockheed factory is planning to manufacture a large aircraft that can carry 157 people, and the Douglas factory also has a 77-ton "Douglas DC-7" that can carry 108 passengers.

The American wartime aircraft industry employed a total of 1.25 million workers, of which one million will be eliminated. This is a serious unemployment problem. Now it is hoped that the post-war civil aviation industry will develop, which may promote production. Recently, the United States government auctioned off 5,000 surplus aircraft, and there were as many as 40,000 applicants, which shows that the public's appetite is not weak. It is expected that private aircraft will be as common as automobiles in the near future. It is estimated that the trade volume of the American aircraft industry next year may reach 100 million yuan, which is less than the wartime 160 million, but three times more than before the war.

### Talking About Books (3)

— Weifeng

Two New Books About China

Because China has become important in the international arena, anything related to China is popular abroad, especially in the United States, at least at one time, anything Chinese had a market.

Writers also followed suit to speculate. Anyone who has stayed in or visited China comes up with a book about something Chinese. Fortunately, no matter how it is written, at least tens of thousands of copies can be sold. Lin Yutang and Pearl Buck made a fortune on this, and now others are following suit.

The two books I have seen recently are: Emily Hahn's "China to Me" and Eskelund's "My Chinese Wife." Both are boring things, but they continue to sell well in the United States. Especially "China to Me," which has consistently been one of the bestsellers since the beginning of this year. As for Emily Hahn, anyone who has stayed in Hong Kong and had some contact with the cultural world knows her. Her writing is quite fluent, but it is unknown whether what she says is fabricated.

Eskelund's Chinese wife is Miss Fei from the Jen Li Carpet Company, a student at Yenching University. He is originally from Denmark, and his father is a doctor in Shanghai. The book talks about his entanglement with Chiang Ching-kuo, and the way he writes is undoubtedly for business reasons everywhere.

Short Story Masterpiece

### The Enemy (16)

— Pearl S. Buck, translated by Zhu Qi

The next morning he made the excuse to go into the guest room first. If the American was gone, he would simply tell Hana that it was the general's idea. But when he opened the door, he immediately saw that this had not happened last night. The fluffy yellow head was sleeping on the pillow. He could hear the quiet, sound sleep of breathing, so he gently closed the door.

He told Hana, "He's sleeping. The fact that he can sleep like this means he's getting better."

"What do we do with him?" Hana said again in a low voice, her old tune.

Sadao shook his head. He replied, "I will have a decision within a day or two."

But he thought it would definitely be the next night. That night the wind rose, and he listened to the branches of the trees being blown up and down by the wind and the howling of the doors and windows.

Hana was also awake. She asked, "Should we go and close the windows and doors of the patient's room?"

Sadao said, "No, he can close them himself now."

But the next morning, the American was still there.

So it would definitely be the third night. The wind had turned into a quiet rain, and the garden was filled with the sound of dripping eaves and running water. Sadao slept better than the previous two nights, but when he heard a cracking sound, he woke up immediately and jumped up.

Hana shouted, "What? Let me go and see." The little baby was awakened by her voice and began to cry loudly.

But he held her back and would not let her move.

She cried, "Sadao, what's wrong with you?"

He muttered, "Don't go, don't go!"

Indeed, terror infected her, and she stood breathless, waiting. There was only silence. They climbed back into bed together again, and the little baby slept between them.

But in the morning, when he opened the door of the guest room, the young man was still there. He was happy, had washed his face, and was standing there. Yesterday he had borrowed a razor and shaved his beard. Today there was also a faint blush on his cheeks.

He said happily, "I'm better."

Sadao pulled his kimono around his sleepy body. He suddenly decided that he could not spend another night like this. He did not care about the young man's life. No, it was just not worth making himself so nervous.

Sadao said, "You're better." He lowered his voice. "You're already very well. I think if I put my small boat on the shore tonight, prepared food and clothing on board, you might be able to row it to the small island not far from the shore. This bird is so close to the shore that there is no need to defend it. The island is flooded during storms, so no one lives on it. But now is not the storm season. You can live there and wait for a Korean fishing boat to pass by. They pass close to the island because the water there is several feet deep."

The young man stared at him, slowly understanding. He asked, "Must I do this?"

Commercial News

### Sharp Drop in the Gold Market

More than 80,000 lower than last Saturday; Commodities and Bonds Rebound Slightly

Yesterday, due to the issue of listing prices for refined gold, there were no clues, and people's hearts were even more timid and fatigued. The general trend was that the majority of speculators became completely one-sided. At the opening, the price immediately dropped from 680,000 to more than 640,000 because the Sichuan Road small money changers' market price for US dollars fell to around 1,000 yuan the previous day, triggering a selling spree. The banks still absorbed some, and after that, a stalemate lasted for a long time, hovering around 650,000. The stockbrokers' bulls were at their wit's end, and continued to liquidate their positions. At noon, the price once fell to 610,000. Various brokerages and money exchange businesses bought in at the low price, and the price rebounded to above 620,000 at noon. However, the vitality had been damaged, and finally it broke through the 600,000 mark. As a result, it plummeted more than 80,000 compared to last Saturday. Gold jewelry fell to 67,000, tael silver to 600 yuan, and silver dollars also slightly decreased to around 430. The covert interest rate was still low because the gold market was hopeless and no one needed it, falling to within 10 cents, generally ranging from a maximum of 11 cents to a minimum of 8 cents.

As foreign banks have already reopened, but the news of listing prices has not yet been implemented, the general trend is unfavorable. The free level is likely to continue to be extended. The previous day, which was a Sunday holiday, the buying price of US dollars had been forced to fall to 1,000 yuan in various market outlets. Although it was said that there was a lack of sales due to the holiday, people's hearts were even more shaken by this. At the opening, the price immediately fell to 1,050 yuan, and a large amount of physical goods continued to flow out, with supply exceeding demand. The 1,000 yuan mark was easily broken, and it was even worse in the afternoon, continuing to fall to 970 yuan, and there were still sales. As a result, it fell 120 yuan compared to last Saturday. Hong Kong dollars also fell accordingly. As a result, old bills fell 20 yuan, and new bills fell 9 yuan. The buying prices were US$3.3 for British pounds, US$2.3 for Australian pounds, 20 to 25 cents for rupees, and 25 cents for Swiss francs.

Bonds: Yesterday, public bonds were in an unfavorable environment, surrounded by enemies on all sides. Those in the industry sold off first, and scattered investors followed. The opening price in the morning was the highest, and the closing price in the afternoon was the lowest. As a result, it fell 10 yuan to 85 yuan compared to Saturday. The decline was most severe for Class C, and the slightest for Class A and B. Speculators sold heavily, and the price difference was therefore reduced by a lot.

Chinese Stocks: Yesterday, Chinese stocks also plummeted with the general trend, and conditions worsened. However, Mei Ya fell less because relevant parties bought heavily. In addition, they all fell by 15%. Foreign Stocks: Foreign stocks were still suppressed by gold and US dollars, and buying interest was sluggish, falling another 10% or so. However, it was still a sell-off of long positions. Except for Ewo Silk, Brewery, and Paper Industries, the rest were all one-sided selling.

Rice and Grain: Although the inland rice market was firm yesterday, the source in Shanghai was abundant, and actual sales were sluggish, turning into a weak situation again. White japonica and indica rice both fell by 600-700 yuan, and medium and lower grades fell by 700-800 yuan. As for oil prices, more goods continued to arrive from Qingdao, and sales were sluggish, with prices falling by more than 2,000 yuan. Flour shops were very slack, rebounding slightly by 200 yuan. There was some trading of soybeans by the Ningbo brokers, and the situation was mediocre. Raw peanuts were firmly priced for first-class, but sluggish for second-class. Actual sales of sorghum liquor were sluggish, falling another 1,000 yuan, and transactions were few.

Yarn Market: After falling for five consecutive days last week, yesterday it fell by another 40,000. Although passenger sales were lively, the factories all sold off at the same time. Gold prices were repeatedly reported lower, and at the same time, the raw materials for floral fabrics were frequently declining, making it even more difficult to boost the market.
