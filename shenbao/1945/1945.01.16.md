### Japanese Special Attack Squadron Fiercely Bombs Enemy Fleet in Lingayen Gulf, Sinking or Destroying Twelve Transport Ships

Central News Agency, Philippine Frontline Base, 15th – To reinforce their forces and solidify their beachhead, the American enemy in Lingayen Gulf is attempting reinforcements by sea. The Japanese air force is continuing its attacks on enemy warships in the bay. On the morning of the 14th, special attack squadrons repeatedly and fiercely attacked enemy fleets in Lingayen Gulf and off the west of Iba. Confirmed results from the escorting aircraft alone include seven enemy transport ships sunk, four ships set ablaze, and one destroyer destroyed.

Central News Agency, Tokyo, 15th – Before the enemy landed on Mindoro Island (December 15th), on the morning of the 14th, the Japanese Special Attack "Kikusui" Flight Corps and others attacked enemy transport fleets and escort vessels off San Jose, making heroic sacrifices. The confirmed results at the time were unclear due to the direct escort aircraft not returning. It is now confirmed that they achieved the brilliant result of sinking over twenty enemy ships.

Central News Agency, Stockholm, 15th – According to a German News Agency report: "Afton Tidning" of New York reports, citing recent news from the Philippines, that American forces on Luzon Island are currently encountering strong resistance from the Japanese army. The report continues, stating that the war situation has become more serious, with reports of strong Japanese advances in all areas.

Supply Routes of Enemy American Forces on Luzon Island Threatened

Central News Agency, Tokyo, 15th – Lingayen Gulf, the landing site chosen by the enemy American forces on Luzon Island, is the same place where Lieutenant General Homma Masaharu's Japanese forces landed their main force during the capture of the Philippines. The nearshore area is generally shallow, making it ideal for landing. Strategically, the area between Lingayen and Manila is the central Luzon plain, allowing mechanized forces to move freely. The distance from Lingayen to Manila is 250 kilometers, with a flat highway connecting them, reachable by ordinary car in just two hours. Looking back, at that time, Lieutenant General Wainwright, the highest commander of the enemy American forces on Luzon Island, deployed his forces from San Fernando to Lingayen Gulf, with the 21st Division defending from Dagupan to Lingayen, the 31st Division from Tarlac to near Iba, and the 51st Division on the south coast of Bataan. A mixed American-Filipino division was stationed near Manila. Before the Japanese landing, the 3rd Division, reinforced from the Visayas Islands, was placed under the command of the 11th and 21st Divisions. Therefore, the units that fought the Japanese landing forces in the Lingayen area were the 11th and 21st Divisions, the 71st and 91st Divisions reinforced from the Visayas Islands, and one special forces division, totaling five divisions. The Japanese landing forces engaged the enemy cavalry and tank units in fierce battles, quickly annihilating these five divisions and advancing towards Manila with a surge of momentum. Therefore, the enemy's landing in the Philippines this time can be said to be imitating the Japanese. What is noteworthy is that the enemy's supply route to the landing site travels 1,500 kilometers from the Surigao Strait, through the Mindanao Sea and Sulu Sea, and then around to the west coast of Luzon. At a normal fleet speed of 15 miles per hour, it would take at least two days and nights. Even for fast escort ships with a speed of 20 miles per hour, it would still take over 43 hours. The enemy's chosen landing site's supply route is constantly threatened by Japanese air and submarine forces along the way. The enemy's operational command is, of course, very familiar with this point.

### Japanese Army Ministry Announces Awarded Units for Achievements in the South Seas, Burma, and Other Regions

Central News Agency, Tokyo, 14th – The Japanese Army Ministry announced today that His Majesty the Emperor has granted commendations to various Japanese units and brave soldiers for their distinguished service in air operations in the South Pacific and Burma fronts, as well as in operations in Central China. The names and summaries of the military achievements of these units and soldiers are listed below: The Nomoto Bomber Squadron was deployed to the Morotai and western New Guinea areas from early January of last year, engaging in enemy combat power annihilation operations. On the morning of December 6th, they conducted a surprise attack on Morotai, achieving great results and greatly assisting the Philippine war situation. The Ichikawa Reconnaissance Flight Corps contributed to the search of the Southwest Pacific region, especially since the enemy landed on Morotai and Leyte. They served as the eyes and ears of the army, providing detailed and accurate reconnaissance of enemy aircraft, greatly assisting in war guidance. Another deputy flight unit completed extremely difficult tasks against a superior enemy air force with few troops, making great contributions to operations in Burma. The Meiri Kesera Airport Service Unit, a branch of the Kesera Airport unit, a strategic location in central Burma, worked hard to assist the flight units and intercepted attacking enemy aircraft, shooting down 62 of them. Lieutenant Nakamura Saburo of the Army has flown 154 sorties since attacking Baoshan Airport on May 4, Showa 17 (1942), either attacking or intercepting. The unit under his command shot down 85 enemy aircraft. The Okada unit was responsible for the defense against the enemy in Yichang. In June of last year, they used superior technology to attack enemy positions six times, defeating them and laying the foundation for the smooth operation in Hunan. The Tanaka unit defended the salient position of Xiling Mountain north of Yichang, repelling over 30 attacks by enemy battalions last year, inflicting annihilating blows on four enemy battalions.

Editorial

### After Reading Mayor Zhou's Letter to the Citizens

Mayor Zhou and the other newly appointed municipal officials assumed their posts yesterday. Mayor Zhou also issued a letter to the citizens and an inaugural address. Secretary-General Luo also made a speech. From these texts, we can observe the direction of the city's administration in the future. After reading Mayor Zhou's letter to the citizens, we also have some thoughts that we would like to discuss with the Mayor and the citizens. First, the first paragraph of the Mayor's letter to the citizens states: "...my best friends and well-wishers from friendly countries have advised me not to take on this job. They are all acting out of concern for me, not wanting me to come to Shanghai to sacrifice myself. They believe that the situation in Shanghai will only become more difficult and worse in the future, and no one will be able to do anything about it..." Indeed, the situation in Shanghai is truly difficult, and the environment in Shanghai is truly bad. Therefore, this burden is indeed quite heavy. Since the passing of the late Chairman Wang and the succession of former Mayor Chen to the central government as acting chairman, he had no time to concurrently serve as the mayor of this city. Looking around, we thought that this heavy burden should be shouldered by Mr. Zhou Fohai. However, more than a month passed, and the central government had not yet announced the candidate for mayor, hesitating and undecided, which made us very anxious. In the editorial of this newspaper on December 25 of last year, we pointed out the importance of Shanghai's position and hoped that a decision would be made and announced as soon as possible. Therefore, our opinion was contrary to that of Mr. Zhou's well-wishers. Our meaning did not seem to be the meaning of Mr. Zhou's best friends. However, later facts proved that Mr. Zhou still shouldered this heavy burden. We expressed our twelvefold joy in the editorial of this newspaper on January 4th of this year.

Second, the second paragraph of the letter to the citizens states: "...I hope that everyone will not have any expectations of me. Without expectations, there will be no disappointment in the future. The greater the expectations, the greater the disappointment in the future. I do not want everyone to be disappointed in the future, so please do not have any expectations now..." We believe that these words are Mr. Zhou's self-deprecating remarks. We certainly have expectations, but we will definitely not be disappointed. Because although the environment in Shanghai is bad, it is not impossible to do anything about it. Mayor Zhou has made two guarantees to the citizens: (1) We will work hard, earnestly, and resolutely. We will not perfunctorily, passively, or complacently avoid hard work and complaints, and we will not engage in bureaucratic jargon. We will diligently work hard and do our best to seek the welfare of the citizens. (2) My cadres and I are all young and promising. Our spirit is that public interest is more important than private interest, and society comes before the individual. We will not use our powers and positions to seek personal gain. We will follow the spirit of integrity in politics established by Acting Chairman Chen, lead by example, and not be corrupt, violate the law, engage in bribery, or seize wealth unjustly. We will diligently investigate, rectify, and do our best to reduce the suffering of the citizens. These two guarantees alone already meet the expectations of the citizens. As long as the guarantees are thoroughly implemented, there will definitely be no disappointment.

Third, the letter to the citizens also mentions the principle of "using severe punishment in a chaotic world." For corrupt officials, treacherous merchants, and evil elements who commit wrongdoing, we will never tolerate or be lenient. We will conduct thorough investigations, obtain concrete evidence, and impose severe punishments. "Using severe punishment in a chaotic world" is something that we have repeatedly advocated in the past. However, although Shanghai is a city of all evils, there are so many rumors. Hoarding, speculation, and manipulating prices are so clever. Unfortunately, severe punishments have never been used, so wrongdoing has become increasingly rampant. We hope that the principle of severe punishment will be thoroughly implemented in the future, especially to eliminate excessive profits and use all efforts to suppress prices. This will reduce the suffering of the citizens and seek the welfare of the citizens. In this way, we can also guarantee that the cooperation of the citizens will be absolutely no problem.

Next, Mayor Zhou's inaugural address, although addressed to public officials, the point of encouraging them to fulfill their duties should also be noted by us citizens. For example, in the Baojia system, every citizen has prescribed tasks. Everyone must fulfill their duties and maximize the effectiveness of the Baojia.

Finally, we suggest, as we have always advocated, that the solution to Shanghai's problems requires a core force to promote it. The formation of this core is the mutual cooperation of the three forces: the municipal government, the people, and the related agencies of the allied countries, to condense into a core. We hope that the Chinese and Japanese authorities, as well as civil leaders, will work together to achieve this.

Secretary-General Luo put forward three points in his speech yesterday. Due to space limitations, we will discuss them tomorrow.

### Mayor Zhou Concurrently Serves as Security Commander, Delivers Inaugural Address

Mayor Zhou of Shanghai, concurrently serving as Security Commander, delivered the following inaugural address yesterday: "This time, I have been appointed in the autumn of crisis and turmoil, and I deeply feel the weight of the responsibility, the difficulty of the environment, and the weakness of my personal abilities. Therefore, I deeply fear that I will not be able to fulfill the mission entrusted by the government or realize the expectations of people from all walks of life at home and abroad. In the future, I will do my best to use my intelligence and talents to serve the citizens of Shanghai. I hope that all my colleagues, both civil and military, in this government and headquarters will do their utmost. The Shanghai municipal administration has been established on a solid foundation and fundamental plan under the management of former Mayor Chen. In the future, I will only seek to implement and complete it step by step on the established foundation, according to the established plan. There are no new policies or plans. However, there are a few points that I would like to mention when I take office today and meet the officials of this government headquarters for the first time.

Each Fulfilling Their Duties

First, I hope that everyone will fulfill their respective duties. This may sound like a cliché, but in the past, no matter what agency or personnel, to be honest, it has not been fully achieved. We must know that what we can do to serve the country and society does not need to be ambitious. As long as we can fulfill our respective duties, that is enough. What the country and society need from us is nothing more than fulfilling our respective responsibilities. If public officials across the country could fulfill their respective duties, the country would have long been strong and prosperous. How could it be as fragmented as it is today? I hope that the public officials of this government headquarters will treat the duties they undertake as their own business. Do not neglect, do not slacken, and do not perfunctorily perform your duties. If the superiors do not supervise, they will not work hard. Even if they are supervised, they will still outwardly comply but inwardly resist. Not only will the cause not be advanced, but the individual will also be unworthy of the country and the people, having eaten the country's salary and received the people's support. Therefore, I hope that everyone will act with conscience and be faithful to their duties.

Do Not Seek Private Gain

Second, I hope that everyone will not use their powers to seek private gain. The reason why the country and society need us is to have us do things for the country and seek welfare for the people. If we use our powers and positions to do things that harm the country and the people, not only will the law not forgive us, but morality will not allow it. Shanghai, a place that has been ruled by Anglo-American imperialism for a hundred years, has become a city of all evils. The environment is too bad, and there are too many temptations. It is certainly not easy for everyone to maintain integrity and not be tempted by the environment. However, we must be frugal, persevering, and use the spiritual power of morality to overcome material temptations. Actions that harm the country and the people are not allowed by our own conscience. In the future, if any acts of fraud are discovered, I will impose severe penalties according to the law. I hope that everyone will also be self-aware and self-disciplined in their morals and conscience.

Raise Treatment

Third, raise the salaries of civil servants to the greatest possible extent. We ask civil servants to fulfill their duties, and we ask them not to use public office for private gain. However, we must do our best to ensure that their minimum living standards are maintained. The salaries of Shanghai municipal civil servants have been raised repeatedly by former Mayor Chen, and the lives of civil servants have been slightly stabilized. However, prices are rising too fast, and it has become a problem again. Now, we plan to increase the salaries of civil servants and military police again. However, Shanghai's finances have fallen into a state of imbalance between revenue and expenditure. If we increase salaries further, expenditure will increase, and the gap between revenue and expenditure will widen even more. I do not want to burden the people too heavily at once, so I want to start by reorganizing tax collection and eliminating embezzlement, and strive to raise salaries to the extent permitted by financial resources. However, during wartime, the lives of officials and people in any country are hard. While the government will do its best to increase salaries, it is hoped that everyone will not forget that it is wartime and will also endure the hardships of life as much as possible.

Personnel Issues

Fourth, I would also like to say something about personnel issues. I have no intention of placing my own people, and I have no need to place my own people. Therefore, I will not change the personnel of this government headquarters casually. However, I want to do things, and I want to do things well. To do things and do them well, I need people with good abilities and good character. Therefore, as long as you are capable and have good character, everyone can rest assured that you will not be changed. As for how to judge whether someone has ability and character, it will of course be determined by objective investigation, and it will never be based on subjective likes and dislikes. I personally, and my cadres as well, will do this. Everyone can rest assured about this. Today, I am taking the opportunity of taking office to briefly express what I want to say. In the future, there will be many difficult problems, and it will not be easy to solve these problems. We can only do our best to do things step by step, without calculating gains or losses, without caring about praise or blame, and without rejecting hard work and complaints. As for right and wrong, we can only let society judge with a fair eye."

### Enemy American Remnant Fleet to Be Annihilated, Japanese Naval Expert Discusses Philippine Island Battle Situation

As the battle for Luzon Island intensifies, a naval expert from the Allied Powers in Shanghai has analyzed the island's battle situation, stating:

Major Battle Will Occur in Luzon Plain

The enemy landing forces in Lingayen Gulf and San Fabian consist of two divisions and a tank unit. The enemy's second and third fleets have arrived near Lingayen Gulf, but do not appear to have landed. The Japanese garrison on the Philippines is currently eliminating the landed enemy forces on the shore. Generals Yamashita and Oga, the commanders of the Japanese forces on the Philippines, have deployed positions along the Agno River, farther from the Lingayen coast, and will engage the enemy in open field battles in the Luzon central plain. The major battle between the Japanese and American forces is about to unfold there. Although part of the enemy air force currently has a slight advantage, it has not yet encountered the open field battles that Japan excels in. The central plains area is beyond the range of the enemy's artillery, making it easier for the Japanese army to use clever tactics. It remains to be seen whether General MacArthur's forces can cope with this most elite open field warfare. At the same time, the Japanese army will inflict maximum attrition on the enemy forces there. Luzon Island is currently in the dry season, which is suitable for open field battles. Japan is stepping up the production of aircraft and sending them to the front lines to strengthen combat capabilities.

Japanese Fleet Prepares for Completion

It is noteworthy what actions the enemy American fleet will take in the seas east of the Philippines and Taiwan in the future. The enemy is gathering forces in the seas around Taiwan and the Philippines, and the Australian and British Pacific Fleets have also been dispatched. Their naval power cannot be underestimated. However, the movements of the Nimitz Fleet may undergo considerable changes. The Japanese Combined Fleet has completed preparations for operations and is closely monitoring the activities of the Nimitz Fleet. Therefore, a major naval battle will occur in the Pacific. As for the appearance of the British Indian Ocean Fleet near Sumatra, it is of a containment nature and has no other effect. In short, this naval and land battle will be the decisive battle for the Greater East Asia War. During the battle, the United States has two major weaknesses:

Two Major Weaknesses of the Enemy Americans

(1) The incompleteness of the supply lines, especially the shortage of fuel, is the biggest reason.

(2) The shortage of troops. According to MacArthur, 200,000 troops have already been used in the Philippine operation. Currently, the enemy has no troops in the New Guinea area. It is a question where they will obtain troops to operate in other locations, especially how they will sustain operations in the Luzon central plain. This is a problem. On the Japanese side, there are no such shortcomings. The Japanese Navy is preparing to annihilate all remaining enemy American fleets from the previous operation.

Unrest in the United States

Currently, there is considerable unrest in the United States. Although Roosevelt has been rapidly appointed president for the fourth time, riots are occurring everywhere domestically. Therefore, the American landing on the Philippines is a propaganda tactic that is advantageous for Roosevelt domestically, used to suppress the riots. However, from a geographical perspective, the United States is making a long trek to invade the Philippines, which is consuming a huge amount of resources. There are endless hidden dangers domestically. Although the United States is currently touting its efforts to produce aircraft, it faces many difficulties due to the lack of labor, making it extremely difficult to achieve its production goals.

Difficult Battle Situation for Landing Enemy Forces

(Central News Agency, Shanghai) The American forces' Philippine landing operation, which began last October, has reached its peak intensity since the landing on Luzon Island. During this period, the American forces have experienced unprecedented bloodshed in history, but they have repeatedly increased their forces, sparing no sacrifice, betting the fate of the country in a desperate last stand, and provoking the final decisive battle. It is not only the counterattack of the elite Japanese forces that is hindering the American advance, and the enemy themselves have made this clear. Here are a few points about the difficult battle situation for the landing operation on Luzon Island that they have disclosed:

The first is that the enemy has forgotten the Philippines' declaration of war against the United States. In these two years, the people of the Philippines have independently established the Greater Philippines Republic, taking on the responsibility of building a part of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, and resolutely declaring war on the United States. However, it is very regrettable that this fact has not been recognized by the American forces. They believe that as long as they land on the Philippines, the residents will raise their hands to welcome them and provide all assistance. However, the Filipinos are no longer slaves of the United States.

MacArthur's headquarters recently announced that, concerning the organization of guerrillas on Luzon Island, they do not expect to assist the American forces or resist the Japanese forces. For example, a considerable number of Filipinos are currently assisting the Japanese forces, acting as spies for the Japanese army, and are quite active. Guerrilla warfare is important for the liberation of Luzon Island, but guerrillas often collude with the enemy, so organizing guerrillas is impossible.

The second point is the lack of ships during the landing operation. According to a Huitong News Agency dispatch from Stockholm on the 12th, the American forces lacked ships during the landing on Luzon Island, and had to request them from anti-Axis countries. British Home Secretary Richard Law embarked on a trip to the United States regarding this issue. Last autumn, the anti-Axis powers originally expected the European war to be coming to an end, but it ultimately failed. In Europe, transporting a division of troops requires 50,000 tons of ships and takes two weeks. However, sending the same division of troops to Luzon Island requires 200,000 tons of ships and takes five months. In short, the operation implemented four months ago based on the misunderstanding that the European war was nearing its end has fundamentally faltered in the current situation. The Pacific warship plan, which they deliberated on at the Quebec Conference last autumn based on the European war situation, has failed, making the operation extremely difficult.

### Raid on Nagoya Enemy Aircraft: 43 Shot Down; Divine Land Bombed, Japanese People Outraged

Tokyo, 15th (Central News Agency) – The Japanese General Headquarters announced at 2:30 PM on the 15th: On January 14th, enemy aircraft attacked the vicinity of Nagoya. After engagement by Japanese forces, the battle results were determined as follows: 9 enemy aircraft shot down, 34 damaged. One Japanese aircraft failed to return.

Tokyo, 14th (Central News Agency) – The Japanese General Headquarters announced on the 14th: At 4:00 PM on the 14th, approximately 60 B-29 type aircraft from the Mariana Islands attacked, centering on the vicinity of Nagoya. An enemy aircraft dropped several bombs on the grounds of the Toyouke Daijingu Shrine, destroying two meditation halls and five Kagura halls. Other damage to the Japanese side was minor.

Tokyo, 15th (Central News Agency) – News from Nagoya: The Ise Grand Shrine in Japan has a long history of 2,605 years and is revered by the Japanese people. On the 14th, American planes attacked Nagoya and bombed part of the shrine. The weather that day was very clear, and the enemy forces clearly knew that there were no factory facilities nearby. Therefore, the enemy aircraft's violent act against the shrine can be determined to be intentional. The Japanese people are greatly angered by the enemy's immoral behavior. All Tokyo newspapers on the 15th published the people's anger.

Tokyo, 15th (Central News Agency) – According to a Nagoya phone call: On the afternoon of the 14th, enemy aircraft invading the Tokai region of Japan carried out the violent act of bombing part of the Ise Grand Shrine, which is revered by the Japanese people. At 2:53 PM that afternoon, three enemy aircraft appeared over the holy site and dropped bombs simultaneously on the outer shrine grounds, landing in the shrine forest, destroying five Kagura halls and two meditation halls. The sacred symbols are all safe. There are no factories or other important facilities near the shrine. Therefore, all Japanese people are outraged by this enemy atrocity and are determined to exterminate the enemy of humanity and the enemy of culture and religion. The Ise Grand Shrine consists of the Kotaijingu and Toyouke Daijingu shrines, commonly known as the inner and outer shrines. The enshrined deity is Toyouke Omikami, who is in charge of agriculture, nurturing living beings, protecting Japan, and laying the foundation for a rich country and a strong army. The deity is extremely revered by the Japanese people.

### Bose Declares Determination; Encourages Indians to Rise Up; Cooperate to Complete the War

Burma Base, 15th (Central News Agency) – Subhas Chandra Bose, chairman of the Provisional Government of India, returned to the military base in Burma on the 10th. On the 12th, he met with a delegation of journalists and announced the determination of the Free India government as follows: I visited Tokyo during the tense situation of the fierce battle in the Philippines. I saw the true state of Japan under wartime conditions. I am convinced that my previous statement that the anti-Axis offensive has reached its peak and that the Axis powers will begin a general counter-offensive was not wrong. Our friendly nations, Japan and Germany, are now entering a new offensive posture, regaining the initiative of the war, and advancing towards the decisive battle. This general offensive in Greater East Asia has entered a new stage, and India (in addition to the past) must complete important tasks. The main purpose of my visit to Japan this time is to complete these important tasks and review important issues related to this. During my visit to Japan, I met individually with Prime Minister Koiso and other cabinet members. Political and military issues have been fully discussed in detail. Japan and India have decided to unite more closely in the future, cooperate together, and complete the war. I believe that the new actions of the Indian National Army will soon prove this. We must make the ugly enemy shed more blood than last year. With this confidence, I visited various parts of Greater East Asia, hoping that all three million compatriots in East Asia will respond to this, devote all their property, and rise up with the determination to fight for independence. During my visit to Japan, I witnessed the spirit of the Japanese special attack forces, who sacrificed their blood and flesh to strike at the arrogant enemy, and I was deeply moved. I believe that similar actions to the Kamikaze special attack team will appear this year, making the holy war even more courageous. The date when we cooperate with the Japanese army to attack the enemy is approaching. Once we break through the British defense line of India, Chittagong and Imphal, then the independent resistance of all India will be confirmed, and the time for the collapse of British power in India is near. The autumn of victory in the Greater East Asia War means that the anti-British sentiment in India will never be extinguished. Three hundred and eighty million compatriots in the country are waiting for the uprising. We take the strongholds from Nikkei in the south to Kohima in the north as the key points of the Indo-Burma front. With our combat experience, we are confident that we can defeat the enemy without a doubt. We are about to begin our advance.

### German Reporter on the Pacific War Situation

Berlin, 15th (Central News Agency) – German People's Observer naval reporter, Gurode Schuland, discussed the Philippine war situation in the newspaper on the 13th, with the main idea as follows: Japan has fully recognized the importance of the Philippines. The success of the operation to destroy the US air force base in South China is also a consideration for the future battle for the Philippines. Today, the US and Japanese armies have met on a vast battlefield, and the use of naval and air forces has become the most important element. The US military has driven heavy fleets far from its bases to the South China Sea and begun dangerous work. The US is using a large number of aircraft carriers to cover landing craft because of insufficient air power at the bases on Leyte Island and Mindoro Island. The strength of the Japanese fleet has been admitted by the US military. It still maintains a strong force and is also deploying Kamikaze special attack teams. Therefore, the Japanese military's combat power has been significantly enhanced. The United Kingdom is also preparing to attack Japan in the southern waters, which is an open secret. Therefore, the development of the Philippine naval battle is increasingly important, presenting a rarely seen harsh and serious situation in the Pacific War.

### Illegal Attack on the Hikawa Maru: Japan Lodges Protest; US Planes Attack Hospital Ship for the 19th Time

Tokyo, 15th (Central News Agency) – The US Air Force previously carried out an illegal attack on the Japanese hospital ship, which caused deep anger in the Japanese government and public. The enemy has repeated this illegal act. The Japanese government has lodged a serious protest against the enemy's illegal behavior, demanding responsibility. On November 25th last year, the Japanese medical ship Hikawa Maru, carrying wounded and sick, was sailing in the waters west of the Bataan Peninsula. At approximately 8:50 AM, in clear visibility, four US planes appeared and dropped bombs from a height of 1,500 meters, followed by machine-gun fire on the deck and bridge. Thirty minutes later, at 9:30 AM, two more US planes appeared, flying at a low altitude of 1,200 meters and strafing with machine guns. Due to this repeated illegal attack, Japanese medical personnel were injured or killed, and the ship was severely damaged. Thanks to the efforts of the captain and all the crew, it avoided sinking, but navigation in the afternoon and the care of the wounded and sick were greatly hampered.

Tokyo, 15th (Central News Agency) – US military aircraft have repeatedly bombed Japanese hospital ships. The Japanese government has demanded that the US government reflect on this illegal behavior based on the 1907 Geneva Convention, international law, and violations of humanitarianism. This time, the US military illegally bombed the Hikawa Maru hospital ship again, so it had no choice but to lodge the 19th protest. After the Japanese government protested to the United States about the sinking of the Japanese hospital ship Buenos Aires Maru in November of the year before last, the US government made a detailed defense of respecting the intent of hospital ships. However, last November, it sank the Muro Maru, resulting in this protest. On the 25th of the same month, it bombed the Hikawa Maru again. This was by no means a misidentification due to weather visibility or other circumstances. Therefore, it can be determined that they deliberately attacked unarmed hospital ships. Furthermore, the name, characteristics, and markings of Japanese hospital ships have been formally notified to the US government. However, since the beginning of the war, Japanese hospital ships have been attacked by the US military as many as eighteen times, and among them, the Buenos Aires Maru and the Muro Maru were sunk.

### Major Decisive Battle Unfolds at the Baranow Bridgehead; Fighting Especially Fierce in the East Prussian Region

Berlin, 15th (Central News Agency) – Haitong News Agency reports: The long-awaited major battle on the Eastern Front has begun. Both sides are fighting to the death on a front stretching more than 1,000 kilometers from Budapest to the Niemen River. The great battle in the East Prussian border area, between Lisa Gora Mountain and the Vistula River, has overshadowed the battles of Kolan and Hongjing. The battle is still in its early stages, and it is unknown what counter-measures the German authorities will take to deal with the Soviet offensive. One focus of the battle is the Baranow bridgehead, where most of four Soviet army corps, one tank army, and three independent tank regiments are located. The southern Soviet army has made slight progress, and a German counterattack has driven the Soviet army back. The pressure of the Soviet army is very strong on the southeastern slope of Lisa Gora Mountain, but the German army is still able to maintain its position. Six Soviet tanks were lost at Baranow. Another focus is the East Prussian region. The Soviet army bombarded with 350 artillery pieces in two hours, and then used 15 infantry divisions and tank teams to break through between Ebenrode and Schloßberg, but failed. The first batch of Soviet troops was heavily bombarded by German artillery, and only the southern suburbs of Schloßberg were broken through. German reserve troops quickly counterattacked and have advanced eastward. Although the weather is bad, the German air force is still providing strong support.

Soviet Army Disregards All-Out Effort

Berlin, 15th (Central News Agency) - German News Agency front-line report: The Soviet army's major offensive, which the German army has long anticipated, is now gradually reaching its climax. The offensive launched by the Soviet army at the Vistula River bridgehead on the 12th began a decisive battle on the morning of the 13th on a front of more than 100 kilometers. The German commander has great confidence, saying that the battle is a battle to determine the fate of winter. The Soviet army is making an all-out effort with all its forces. The goal of the Soviet army at the Baranow bridgehead is to target Upper Silesia. The Soviet army in East Prussia is expanding the battle area with Königsberg as its target.

### Grew Warns the People Not to Be Optimistic About the War

German News Agency: Former Ambassador to Japan and current Undersecretary of State Grew told the press on Saturday that although the US military has landed in the Philippines, there should be no illusions about the anti-Axis war against Japan. He knows the character of the Japanese people well and can predict that after suffering a slight setback, the Japanese will redouble their efforts. The war against Japan will be prolonged and arduous.

### German Soldiers Uphold Humanitarianism, Representatives Donate Blood

Berlin, 15th (Central News Agency) – German News Agency report: Recently, a sergeant in the US First Army on the Western Front suffered a severe lung injury and underwent a blood transfusion in a German hospital.

### Sweden and Finland Conduct Economic Negotiations

Stockholm, Sweden, 15th (Central News Agency) – Haitong News Agency reports: Finland and Sweden will begin important economic negotiations today. The Finnish Minister of Supply and the Minister of Commerce, along with several experts, have now arrived here. The former Finnish Ambassador to Sweden, Wassastina, arrived here a few days ago to prepare for the negotiations. The purpose of the negotiations is to determine the amount of food that Sweden can transport in the next three to six months. Currently, Sweden's food transportation is not proceeding according to plan due to transportation difficulties, which is the reason for the previous rumors of negotiations between Finland and the Soviet Union. At the same time, the transportation of raw materials from Sweden to Finland to help develop the metal industry will also be discussed. It is still difficult to predict Sweden's ability to supply, but for the sake of Sweden's interests, it is necessary to help Finland's economy avoid collapse and prevent the Soviet Union from exerting political pressure on Finland again.

### Fierce Fighting Underway in Southern Belgium; Anti-Axis Forces Reinforce to Save Critical Situation

Berlin, 15th (Central News Agency) – Haitong News Agency reports: Although the British and American armies have suffered heavy losses on the Western Front in the past 24 hours, their pressure on the German positions has not diminished slightly.

Six US divisions have been called back for replenishment, and two US tank divisions have been called back to Lower Alsace to resolve the critical situation. The British army in the Ardennes is closely pursuing the retreating German army, not leaving an inch. The US First Army is pressing south 14 kilometers north of Hoffalize, and the pressure between Marhay and La Roche is also heavy. On the south side, the US Third Army is attacking north from Bastogne, attempting to meet up with the US First Army on the north side. The German army is counterattacking. The US army's attack on Bishchdorf failed. The eight attacks on Wessenburg were ineffective. The German army in Belgium and Luxembourg is still 60 kilometers west of its original positions.

### Wartime Manchukuo

Speech by Zhang Jinghui

The national strength of Manchukuo is growing with the times, its international standing is steadily rising, and it has made great contributions to completing the Greater East Asia War. The Emperor of Manchukuo is greatly concerned with strengthening the war effort of allied nations. Previously, to conserve steel resources, he ordered the suspension of the construction of the new palace. Recently, he has further promoted the campaign to collect platinum and gold, offering up everyday platinum products, bronzeware, and works of art as a demonstration to the people. The Prime Minister, Zhang, with a calm and unhurried demeanor, commands the people and enjoys their trust. On December 2nd, when a reporter (Kusumi, special correspondent) visited the State Council, he was granted an audience with Prime Minister Zhang, who delivered a grand speech:

"Manchukuo must overcome all difficulties, increase production, and cooperate with allied nations. The difference between the relationship between Japan and Manchukuo and other nations in the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere is, as His Majesty the Emperor has declared, that we are inseparable in life and death, just like flesh and blood. This war is truly decisive for the destiny of East Asia. If the war is lost, we Orientals will become slaves of the Anglo-Americans. Therefore, we must fight to the end; and I myself hold an unwavering belief that this war will be won. Manchukuo's responsibility grows ever greater as the war situation progresses. To defend Greater East Asia, we must gather the total strength of all our people and engage in a death-or-glory struggle in all production sectors."

When the editor brought up the matter of special attack units, he briefly said:

"Regarding the Kamikaze Special Attack Corps, I have read about it in the newspapers. I have also heard others talk about the news of the Army Special Attack Corps. I am filled with admiration and respect. A few days ago, I saw a film of the Kamikaze Special Attack Corps departing, and when I saw the scene of them drinking and embarking on their journey, I couldn't help but shed tears. I deeply feel that since the allied soldiers are fighting so bravely, Manchukuo must work harder to increase production in response."

The morale of wartime Manchukuo can also be felt from Prime Minister Zhang.

Agricultural Production Increase Campaign

Today is the peak season for the collection of agricultural products in Manchukuo. Manchukuo's agriculture bears the important task of supplying food to China, Japan, and Manchukuo. The amount of produce supplied by farmers increases year by year, and this year an unprecedentedly large procurement target has been set. Last year and this year (Republic of China years 32 and 33) have both been years of bumper harvests unseen in recent times. The harvest work is now proceeding according to a new plan and direction. The whole of Manchukuo presents a lively atmosphere, and the amount collected has reached 50% of the target, fully demonstrating the power of the food source of Greater East Asia.

The Manchukuo government has now formulated countermeasures for increasing production in the coming year, deciding to increase production targets by 10% for general farmers and 50% for settlers. In addition, to improve agricultural affairs, various policies are also being studied in terms of technical mobilization at agricultural organizations, research institutes, agricultural experiment stations, and the like. In addition, the construction of reclaimed farmland, which has been the focus of implementation since this year, is also progressing steadily. The first water lifting station project, the central facility of the Second Songhua River area project, a large-scale project that boasts to be unparalleled in the world, has been completed on schedule. In the northern part of Manchukuo, the construction of waterways using the frozen period is also progressing steadily, with continuous efforts being made in the severe cold of minus 30 degrees Celsius.

Leap Forward in Light Metals Industry

As for the mining and industrial sectors, problems with labor and equipment are unavoidable for rapidly developing emerging countries, but they are currently overcoming numerous difficulties and continuing their efforts. In the past, all mining and industrial production equipment was supplied by Japan, Germany, the United States, and overseas. Today, with the rapid development of the domestic machine tool industry, measures are being promoted to encourage the effective use of existing equipment and the repair of damaged equipment, exploring various creative methods in the use of equipment that can be called the greatest frugality.

The current state of coal production in Manchukuo, which is rich in coal deposits, is particularly promising in the old Manchurian coalfields. In addition, promising new coalfield projects in certain areas of Sanjiang Province and Tonghua Province are also progressing steadily. The production target for the coming year is 20% higher than this year's production target, and preparations are underway.

The Manchurian Steel Manufacturing Company, which undertakes one wing of the wartime allied steel industry, is seeking ways to increase production with a new spirit. The Anshan area has now become a target for enemy bombing, but the steel production warriors are fighting against enemy aircraft, desperately striving to ensure absolute production. As for the light metals industry, in response to the wartime demand that "the more airplanes, the better," measures to increase the production of aluminum are being actively studied, and the future is very promising.

In addition, the increase in production of molybdenum, flake graphite, tungsten, shale oil, etc. is also progressing. Tartaric acid lime, which has emerged with a new mission as a resource for modern weapons, has mobilized all the wild grapes that are a specialty of Manchukuo. In addition, the increased production of alcohol and the distilleries that produce sorghum liquor are being revived with the cooperation of Manchurian indigenous capital. The forests of northeastern Manchukuo, which are sealed off by ice and snow, have entered the peak season for winter logging, and efforts are being made to urgently mobilize wartime timber resources. On the other hand, the railways that transport these timber, agricultural products, and the large amount of coal needed in winter are also engaged in a fierce struggle for decisive transportation, regardless of adverse conditions such as supply difficulties.

Labor Service System

From this year to the coming year, among the most noteworthy issues, the decisive labor mobilization situation is one aspect. The rapidly expanding and strengthening wartime industry requires a great deal of labor, and recruiting labor from North China is simply hopeless due to price differences. As a result, the domestic labor supply situation, especially the labor required by the wartime industry, must be secured domestically. Regarding this matter, the National Labor Service System, which has been implemented since last year, has already achieved good results. On the other hand, the "Labor Service System" for Japanese and Manchurian students also echoes the Japanese mainland. Since the end of September, students above the senior level of both male and female secondary schools have been subject to year-round mobilization, which will be further expanded and strengthened in the coming year.

In order to strengthen labor countermeasures, the government authorities passed the "Outline for the Implementation of Decisive Labor Mobilization" at the State Council meeting on November 15th, deciding to apply it from the coming year. Until now, a labor supply policy that does not require North Chinese labor has been established since the founding of the country. The framework for this policy is a mobilization plan based on the preparation of labor mobilization registers, as well as the renewal of labor management and the establishment of labor bases for various important industries.

In addition, in view of the urgent labor situation, the Japanese Kwantung Army has twice recruited a large number of female military personnel, allowing male military personnel who originally worked in the army to be transferred to important industrial sectors. The government is also implementing the labor workplace mobilization of government special organization staff. Under the leadership of the governor, the Political Affairs Department is the base, and all 1,000 Japanese and Manchurian staff members under the age of 30 are sent to the aircraft and steel production sectors. Due to the government's leading by example, a trend of stepping forward to work in wartime industries has been fostered in the private sector. The current Manchukuo, closely following the intense war situation, is increasingly showing its majestic spirit. People of all ethnic groups from all walks of life are working together with one heart and one mind, uniting to destroy the enemy Anglo-Americans, and advancing together towards a victorious future.

### Secretary-General Luo Announces Key Points of Administration - Three Main Points Proposed

The newly appointed Secretary-General of the Shanghai Special Municipal Government, Luo Junqiang, together with the newly appointed Director of the Municipal Government's Propaganda Department, Liu Dexuan, met with Chinese and Japanese news reporters in the conference hall of the Municipal Government Building at 5:30 p.m. yesterday (the 15th) to announce the key points of the Municipal Government's administration and introduce the newly appointed Director of the Propaganda Department, Liu, and the Chief of the General Affairs Section of the Municipal Government, Cao Gonggang. Luo said: "I have been ordered to participate in the work of the Shanghai Municipal Government this time. I will take the determination of fighting for the revolution together with the newly appointed Mayor Zhou for the past twenty years and move forward with even more perseverance and diligence. Mayor Zhou has repeatedly declined the concurrent position of Mayor of Shanghai to the highest authorities due to the heavy burden of his various positions. However, due to various reasons, he resolutely took on this important task, which is related to the future of Greater Shanghai and the welfare of all citizens. The mayor has frankly described this in an article addressed to the people of Shanghai and in his inaugural speech. As for the key points of the Municipal Government's administration in the future, I will briefly present several items in accordance with the special instructions of President Chen of the Executive Yuan and Mayor Zhou:

Work Hard and Lead by Example

(1) Work hard and lead by example. The reason why Mayor Zhou did not issue a grand declaration of administration at the beginning of his tenure is that Mayor Zhou is one of the key officials in the central government. The policies promoted by Acting Chairman Chen in accordance with the will of the late Chairman Wang are the policies promoted by the Municipal Government. It is only necessary to follow these basic policies, adapt to the local conditions and the times, and use the necessary means to promote their implementation. Today, public officials, regardless of whether they are civil or military, regardless of their rank, must work hard and lead by example in order to fulfill their mission. Upholding discipline and implementing a clean government policy, at a time when the Greater East Asia War has reached a decisive stage, where should Shanghai start? First, it should be to uphold the discipline of public officials and the entire military police force in order to achieve a clean government. First, it is necessary to guarantee the minimum standard of living for officials. Today, in wartime, life is inherently a very simple issue, and the lives of officials must naturally be subject to the restrictions that should be imposed during wartime. It is natural that some bad and unnecessary personnel in public offices should be eliminated. Only those who are diligent in their duties can obtain a corresponding position, and only those who are diligent in their duties have the right to advocate for their livelihood. This is not only a municipal issue, but also the general key point of today's politics. Those who enjoy a considerable degree of livelihood security but still disregard the wartime system and do evil will naturally only be dealt with decisively and punished according to the law.

Increase Production and Cooperate in the War

(2) Increase production, stabilize people's livelihoods, and cooperate in the Greater East Asia War. This point is more difficult than the previous two, and we must do our best to implement it. Only by concentrating all human and material resources on production can we stabilize the lives of citizens, which is an active measure to assist the war. Just in terms of labor issues, just like upholding the discipline of officials, benefits must be attributed to the diligent. There is no need to protect those who want to gain without working. In terms of the allocation of daily necessities, we should also increase production and increase transactions in order to seek an absolute increase in production. Regarding this point, we should also value diligent workers. This way, production can be increased, and people's livelihoods can be stabilized, which is to assist the war in spirit and in substance. Also, at this time of war, positive administrative measures such as prohibiting waste and saving consumption should also be carried out simultaneously. In short, there are many problems, and we should especially strive for contact between superiors and subordinates, and between left and right. We hope that the relevant agencies will provide more assistance and work together to promote various affairs, and we hope that all the citizens of Shanghai and the elders and advanced members of the community will diligently supervise and guide us so that we can fully implement the above-mentioned administration. Public and private matters are very difficult."

### Inauguration Ceremony of New and Old Police Chiefs - Commander Zhou Encourages Them to Be Honorable Police

The newly appointed Police Chief of Shanghai Zhou Fohai, at 11:00 a.m. yesterday (the 15th), held a ceremony in the hall on the eighth floor of the Police Bureau. Deputy Chiefs Su Chengde and Lu Ying, Chief Sun Lifu, and more than one hundred senior police officers above the level of department heads, section chiefs, and branch chiefs respectfully welcomed Commander Zhou, who arrived on time with Xiong Jiandong, Chief of Staff of the Security Command of the city. The ceremony began with the Police Bureau's band playing music. After singing the national anthem and performing the ceremony, the new and old chiefs handed over the seals. Deputy Chief Du represented former Chief Chen in handing over the seals. All the staff bowed to the new and old chiefs. Then, Commander Zhou delivered a speech. After the speech, the ceremony ended with music. Commander Zhou went to the police chief's office to take office and met with various senior police officers, whom he encouraged.

There have been some personnel changes in the Police Bureau. Man Qiwai has been appointed as the acting Director of the General Affairs Department. Chief Secretary Sun Lifu's resignation has been approved, and the vacancy has been filled by Li Shiyu, Director of the Judicial Department. Director of the Administrative Department Lu Qi's resignation has been approved, and the vacancy has been filled by Pinggang Yong, Director of the Police Defense Department. Hong Demao has been appointed as Acting Secretary (Recommended). All the above-mentioned directors have gone to the bureau to work yesterday.

Commander Zhou's Speech

"Today, I am taking office as the Police Chief of Shanghai. I am very happy to meet with my colleagues from the Police Bureau for the first time.

When the National Government moved its capital back in 1940, the Ministry of Police Affairs was established. I was ordered to serve as the first Minister of Police Affairs. Now that I have come to Shanghai and am also serving as the Police Chief, I did not expect that I would have such a deep connection with police affairs.

Police Task

The task of the police is to be responsible for implementing government orders for the government and to be responsible for protecting the safety of the people for the people. Therefore, whether the politics are good and whether the people can live and work in peace depends entirely on whether the police can properly perform their duties. If the police cannot properly implement government orders, but instead use various laws and orders to engage in malpractice and self-interest, the politics will never be clear. If the police cannot protect the people, but instead use their strength to oppress or exploit the people, the people will never be at peace. Since the police are responsible for being honest, self-disciplined, and faithfully protecting the people, and for performing their tasks, you all have specialized knowledge and experience, so I don't need to say much more.

Honorable Police

The task of the police is sacred, so the police and police officers should be loved by the people, not hated by the people. To be loved by the people is to be an honorable police officer, and to be hated by the people is to be a disreputable police officer. Every police officer in Shanghai must reflect on themselves, whether they are loved by the citizens or hated by the citizens, whether they are an honorable police officer or a disreputable police officer. Every police officer, whether Chinese or foreign, must ask themselves this question. We must gain the love of the citizens, we must be honorable police officers.

Future Facilities

Completing the honorable police of Shanghai is the foundation of all my future facilities. Under the guidance of former Chief Chen, the police administration of Shanghai has already been on track. My task is to follow this track, gradually reorganize, and gradually enrich it to complete the construction of the honorable police of Shanghai.

My future plan is to increase treatment to the greatest extent possible within the scope permitted by financial resources. At the same time, with the expectations of all parties, I will make the greatest efforts to rectify the network discipline. I hope that all police officers will be self-disciplined and self-motivated."

### New Directors of Various Bureaus and Departments Took Office Yesterday

Finance Bureau

The newly appointed Director of the Municipal Finance Bureau, Luo Junqiang, went to the bureau at 4:00 p.m. yesterday to take office.

Economic Bureau

The newly appointed Director of the Municipal Economic Bureau, Xu Jiang, went to the bureau at 4:00 p.m. yesterday to officially take office.

Former Director Xu Tianchen personally went to the bureau to preside over the handover. After taking office, Xu immediately convened a meeting of all staff to give instructions. Regarding the future economic policies of the city, Xu made the following remarks, saying: "Shanghai is the economic center of the region and a major resource base in the rear of the Greater East Asia War. Therefore, the economic dynamics of Shanghai are more important than anywhere else. I have been ordered to take over as the Director of the Municipal Economic Bureau at a time when production is declining, prices are soaring, and speculation and manipulation are rampant. The people are suffering more and more. I am determined to use my best efforts, be honest and self-disciplined, and, under the leadership of Mayor Zhou and Secretary-General Luo, actively advance in accordance with the outline of the current economic policy. We must ensure that the economic situation in Greater Shanghai is stable and that all industries and businesses can develop soundly under strict organization, so as to increase production, save consumption, balance prices, and stabilize people's livelihoods. For the policy is not in many words, and at the beginning of my tenure, I would like to take this as the goal of implementation and encourage all businessmen and people in the city."

Public Works Bureau

The newly appointed Director of the Municipal Public Works Bureau, Xu Jidun, officially took office at 4:00 p.m. yesterday (the 15th). The internal selection of new section chiefs is as follows: Chief Secretary Yue, Chief of the First Section Wang Lian, Chief of the Second Section Shang Zheng, Chief of the Third Section Zheng Dingbang, and Chief of the Fourth Section Wang Deheng.

Material Distribution Office

The newly appointed Director of the Material Distribution Office, Liu Xingchen, officially took office at 4:00 p.m. yesterday and made the following remarks: "Since I have just taken office, I am not familiar with all the material distribution matters. However, in the future, I am determined to establish a distribution system and cultivate people's distribution habits as two major guidelines to continue the unfinished work of former Director Feng. Although material distribution is initiated by the government, I earnestly hope that the government and the people will cooperate to achieve practical results." It is also learned that the personnel in the various sections and offices of the Material Distribution Office will not be changed for the time being.

Propaganda Department

The Director of the Municipal Propaganda Department, Liang Xiuyu, submitted his resignation, which has been approved by the Mayor and replaced by Liu Dexuan. The handover of the new and old directors is scheduled to be held this afternoon. Liu once served as the editor-in-chief of Wuhan Daily and China Daily. He was recently transferred from the President of Anhui Daily to Shanghai. It is expected that he will give the greatest cooperation to promote and develop Shanghai's news industry.

### Mayor Zhou Also Serves as Air Defense Chief

After Mayor Zhou took office, the Municipal Civil Air Defense Headquarters has undergone some changes in personnel. The position of Chief is held concurrently by Mayor Zhou. The Chief Deputy Chief is held concurrently by Secretary-General Luo Junqiang of the Municipal Government. The Deputy Chief is held concurrently by Du Zhengjian, Deputy Chief of the Municipal Police Bureau. Cao Jingang, former Police Chief of Anhui Provincial Capital and Major General Deputy Adjutant of the Bengbu Pacification Office, has been transferred to serve as Chief Secretary. As for the chiefs and section chiefs of the various departments, they have not been changed.

### Key Allocation for Reporters - Investigation Begins

In order to stabilize the lives of wartime staff and enhance work efficiency, the Municipal Material Distribution Office recently decided to include reporters and editors from various newspapers in the city in the scope of key allocation. Now that the key allocation for reporters is about to begin, the Material Distribution Office has sent a letter to the Municipal Propaganda Department to assist in the investigation in order to understand the reporters and editors of various newspapers in the city. It is reported that the Propaganda Department has now sent a letter to the Shanghai News Association and the Journalists Association, requesting various newspapers to list the number of reporters and editors in their respective newspapers for transfer and distribution.

### Scarcity of American Goods Has Become a Common Phenomenon: Interview with Director Matsudaira

The Shanghai Office of the Allied Japanese Embassy held its routine press conference yesterday afternoon. At the conference, Director Matsudaira of the Information Department mentioned the increasing scarcity of goods in the United States since the start of the war, and provided the following information as evidence. The Director also stated that the United States, as a nation, has always been known for its abundance of materials, but today this phenomenon exists. The people of Shanghai should be frugal and economical and be aware of this warning.

Regarding the facts revealed about the recent shortage of supplies in the United States, the following were mentioned: The American army in Europe is using more bandages than originally planned for wounded soldiers. According to yesterday's telegram, Mr. Harley, the head of the Red Cross, stated that three months ago, it was estimated that 100 million rolls of bandages would be needed and sent to Europe for use. During peacetime, 89% of the rubber raw materials consumed in the United States were imported from Malaya. After the start of the Greater East Asia War, the source was cut off, resulting in a severe shortage of rubber in the country, and the public could no longer obtain rations of this item. The American paper industry was originally very developed, and Canada produced a lot of paper. However, the situation has changed, and the amount of paper is decreasing daily. Except for newspapers and magazines, which can still obtain paper for publication, other sectors have no paper available, and many large-scale publishing houses have closed down. After the outbreak of the war, there was also a great shortage of clothing materials. Currently, to save clothing materials, it is stipulated that men's jackets cannot use double-breasted buttons, and the bottom of trouser legs cannot be folded. For women, the length of skirts should be two inches below the knee. Last year, the American people could only receive nine pairs of socks per year, but the materials were extremely poor. For better socks, only one pair could be obtained per 35 people. The production of American tobacco is now also much lower than before. Since last summer, residents in various places who want to buy cigarettes have had to line up in front of tobacco shops early in the morning (similar to the rush to buy cigarettes in Shanghai). The military's tobacco ration has been reduced, and the soldiers are generally dissatisfied.

The United States never publishes information about the various situations of material shortages, making it impossible for people to speculate. The actual situation is unknown. Although the above news is mostly fragmentary and trivial, it can be inferred that the phenomenon of material shortages in the United States is quite common.

### New Year City Sounds: Actively Evacuate the Population of This City

-- Yushun

Evacuating the urban population is one of the important wartime measures. Looking back at Shanghai, the largest city in China, the population has increased since the incident. In the past, the municipal authorities have always adopted a laissez-faire attitude towards this, and fortunately, no tragic consequences have occurred so far. However, with the recent intensification of the war, it is necessary to actively evacuate the population of Shanghai:

The Necessity of Evacuation (1) Air Defense Needs: At this stage of the decisive battle, the war has become fierce, and the dual air raids are becoming more frequent. If the unprecedentedly dense population of this city is not evacuated as soon as possible, casualties will be inevitable once bombing occurs. It will be difficult to provide relief to refugees. The tragedy in Hankou City on December 24 last year is likely to reappear in this city, so it is necessary to prepare in advance.

(2) Economic Needs: The daily necessities of the citizens of this city, except for industrial products that can be obtained locally, such as food and fuel, must be transported from hundreds or even thousands of miles away. Assuming that the citizens who currently reside in Shanghai need to reside in Shanghai in all respects, then this method of supply is still justifiable. However, it is found that at least one-third of the current citizens have no need to reside in Shanghai. If more than one-third of the population is evacuated to food-producing areas and fuel supply areas, at least a lot of manpower and material resources can be saved, and prices in this city can be reduced.

(3) Security Needs: Since this city has been affected by power restrictions and material shortages, industry and commerce have been greatly reduced. Layoffs are often heard, and the number of unemployed has increased sharply. If they are laid off and still have a considerable amount of severance pay in their hands, if they do not return to their hometowns at this time, after a considerable period of time, their funds will be exhausted, and they will inevitably be in a desperate situation where they cannot return to their hometowns or survive, which will be detrimental to the security of this city. Therefore, it is best to evacuate the population around the time of the lunar New Year.

From this, it can be said that the municipal authorities should make actively evacuating the population one of the important policies for this year for the sake of the future of this city.

Evacuation Methods As for the evacuation methods, there are two types: forced evacuation and voluntary evacuation, each with its own advantages and disadvantages. However, when the situation is not very tight, it seems that voluntary evacuation has more advantages than disadvantages. In fact, among all the citizens of this city, there are a considerable number of people who are eager to return to their hometowns, but they want to stop because of the difficulty of transportation. If the authorities can urge them and provide them with assistance in travel, they will definitely be willing to return to their hometowns immediately. During the voluntary evacuation period, for example, six months, preparations for forced evacuation can be made at the same time, such as investigating the occupations of citizens to determine the basis for their stay.

The work of evacuating the population should be led by the Social Welfare Bureau, assisted by the various hometown associations in Shanghai and the local authorities of various counties, and it is hoped that the police and transportation agencies will cooperate.

The most difficult problem to solve when evacuating the population is transportation. This requires the cooperation of the Central China Railway Company and the Shanghai Inland River Shipping Company and other inland river shipping companies. Regarding the Central China Railway Company, it is hoped that the company will use the empty cars of freight trains returning to Nanjing and Hangzhou to transport citizens returning to their hometowns with the same destination. For example, it is stipulated that the first to fifth cars (counting down) of a certain train are exclusively for passengers returning to Changzhou, and these five cars will be dropped off at Changzhou Station. The eleventh cars and earlier are exclusively for passengers returning to Nanjing. Regarding inland river ships, it is hoped that each company will prepare "evacuation passenger ships" attached to the "normal passenger ships", so that citizens can return to their hometowns by land. It can also be returned by waterway, thus increasing the speed of evacuation. As for car and ship tickets, it is best to waive them, otherwise, a large discount must be given to reduce the burden on citizens returning to their hometowns, and convenience must be provided for carrying luggage.

Citizens returning to their hometowns on free or discounted cars and ships should first obtain a certificate of origin and a return home permit from the various hometown associations in Shanghai and register with the Social Welfare Bureau. Those without hometown associations in Shanghai should obtain a certificate of origin from the Baojia chief. Then, the Social Welfare Bureau will notify the return date and method according to the order of registration.

In short, evacuating citizens is certainly not a simple and easy task, but it is indeed a matter that needs to be handled urgently. It is hoped that the municipal authorities can formulate a meticulous evacuation plan under the principles of convenient procedures, saving expenses, and rapid evacuation, and put it into practice immediately.

### Tongde Medical College Takes the Lead in Providing Free Places; Hoping That Authorities of Other Schools Will Follow

The day before yesterday, we wrote to the authorities of various schools, suggesting that stipulating "reasonable tuition and miscellaneous fees" is the most effective way to relieve students from dropping out of school. Sure enough, Tongde  Medical College took the lead in responding, and specially set up ten places for scholarship students and new students with tuition waivers. The original letter stated: "To whom it may concern, our college has always been grateful for your newspaper's  heartfelt cultivation of poor students, providing scholarship assistance. In response to the organization of your newspaper's special scholarship fundraising team, our college has specially assisted five scholarship students with tuition waivers, named the "Tongde Medical College Team," and donated five tuition waivers for new students, named the "Tongde Medical College Clinic Team," and donated five tuition waivers for new students, named the "Tongde Medical College Clinic Team," named the "Tongde Medical College Clinic Team," and donated five tuition waivers for new students, named the "Tongde Medical College Clinic Team," and donated five tuition waivers for new students, named the "Tongde Medical College Clinic Team," and donated five tuition waivers for new students, named the "Tongde Medical College Clinic Team," and donated five tuition waivers for new students, named the "Tongde Medical College Clinic Team," and donated five tuition waivers for new students, named the "Tongde Medical College Clinic Team," and donated five tuition waivers for new students, named the "Tongde Medical College Clinic Team," and donated five tuition waivers for new students, named the ""Tongde Medical College Clinic Team," named the "Tongde Medical College Clinic Team," named the "Tongde Medical College Clinic Team," named the "Tongde Medical College Clinic Team," named the "Tongde Medical College Clinic Team," named the ""Tongde Medical College Clinic Team," named the "Tongde Medical College Clinic Team," named the "Tongde Medical College Clinic Team," named the "Tongde Medical College Clinic Team," named the ""Tongde Medical College Clinic Team," named the "Tongde Medical College Clinic Team," named the "Tongde Medical College Clinic Team," named the ""Tongde Medical College Clinic Team," named the "Tongde Medical College Clinic Team," named the "Tongde Medical College Clinic Team," named the ""Tongde Medical College Clinic Team," named the "Tongde Medical College Clinic Team," named the "Tongde Medical College Clinic Team," and donated five tuition waivers for new students, named the "Free Consultation and Medicine Distribution Team," especially to inform you, please check." Tongde has a long history, is large in scale, and is extremely well-managed. Anyone familiar with Shanghai's education system can say this. This time, it specially set up ten free places, each worth 50,000 yuan, for a total of 500,000 yuan, which is quite considerable. The school authorities are generous in helping students and benefiting the poor, and their contributions are immeasurable! It is hoped that other universities, middle schools, and primary schools can follow suit and set up more free places and expand the effect of scholarship assistance. Our colleagues often optimistically believe that the future of the nation and the nation is deeply dependent!

Bayer Pharmaceutical Factory Enthusiastically Helps Students

Bayer Pharmaceutical Company wrote: "Previously, on August 17, we sent a draft and donated 100,000 yuan to be divided equally between your newspaper and the News Daily Scholarship Fund, which we believe has been noted. Currently, the economic situation is deteriorating day by day, and the threat to students' education is even greater. The next semester will begin soon before the lunar New Year. Our company always takes the happiness of the Chinese people to heart, and especially tries to manage it, donating 200,000 yuan, to be divided equally between your newspaper and the News Daily Scholarship Fund. A check for 100,000 yuan is attached, please check and receive it, but state that it is only for students in the medical field. We admire your newspaper's selfless spirit, and dare to wish you a complete success, so as to repay your newspaper's efforts.

The High Moral Character of Foreign Merchants in Helping Students Is Commendable

Lu Meizeng, a giant in the advertising industry, wrote: "To whom it may concern, I am enclosing a check for 100,000 yuan for the medical student scholarship from Bayer Pharmaceutical Factory of Germany, along with the original English letter. Please check. For decades, the factory has been extremely concerned about charitable undertakings in our country's society and has provided much assistance, either in the form of money and medicine, or in the form of advertising publications, all of which are generously contributed. Today, there are very few foreign merchants in Shanghai who can benefit Chinese students. The spirit of the factory's willingness to do what is right is admirable. The current General Manager, Mr. W. Berchtle, has not been in China for long, but he expresses his sympathy for the scholarship assistance. Two weeks ago, he had the joy of having a son, and personally donated an additional 50,000 yuan to your newspaper's scholarship fund, which is enclosed with this letter. I hope you will publish it, and I will be extremely grateful."

Furen Middle School Teachers and Students Raise Funds

The Furen Middle School Poor Student Scholarship Committee wrote: "To whom it may concern, your newspaper advocates scholarships to help young students avoid dropping out of school. Over the years, you have worked hard and achieved remarkable results, and your reputation has spread far and wide, admired not only by colleagues in the education community. However, in recent months, prices have risen endlessly, and it is expected that the number of dropouts in the next semester will increase dramatically, while scholarship agencies in various places will have to allocate funds to the original number of students. Witnessing the group that previously struggled to support themselves and did not request assistance will now have no way to appeal and will be wandering down the wrong path, our school's teachers and students have initiated a poor student scholarship campaign to help new and old students in our school who are poor and have not received assistance from other places in the next semester. This week, we have been promoting it unanimously and have received the support of enthusiastic people in the community and enlightened parents. As of yesterday, we have received 1.5 million yuan in cash, and we are donating a portion of it to Shenbao and Xinbao, distributed according to the proportion of students receiving assistance in the school. The small amount is insignificant and is only a small contribution. Teacher representative Zhu Kongrong and student representative Qiu Jinyu are personally presenting a check for 40,000 yuan, along with a list, please check and receive it."

Scholarships Received Yesterday: Zhang Da 5,000 yuan, Lilv Shi 3,500 yuan, Songhe, Tang Chengzhang combined 3,000 yuan, Shou Shan Printing Department (delivered by Zhao Zengkui) 2,500 yuan, Jiaodian San Yi 1,800 yuan, Chen Dingwei 1,200 yuan, Anonymous (delivered by Pu Qiting) Shen Jun, Lu Jia Yuantang, Zhang Jun, Zhu Jinjian each 1,000 yuan, Xu Tiquan from Nanjing (to celebrate the birthday of cousin Zhang Yongxu and his wife), Zhou Qiutao each 500 yuan, Li Yixin, Ying Yongyu (Lin Kanghou's son's wedding) each 200 yuan. Total income: 23,400 yuan in currency, remaining balance: 7,649,043 yuan.

This newspaper's reader scholarship, a special committee decides the policy, and the office handles the affairs. Mr. Bin Su, in addition to undertaking a part of the fundraising work, will not be consulted on other matters due to his position. Due to insufficient funds, the 8th scholarship is limited to subsidizing old students. Recently, friends from all walks of life have entrusted new students to apply, but in fact, it is impossible to comply. In addition to answering directly, I hope you will understand.

National Forum

### Several Methods for Rescuing Students from Dropping Out

— Zhang Qikun

The increase in tuition fees and the number of young people dropping out of school are increasing in the same direction, which is an inevitable fact. The serious consequences of this have been discussed in great detail in recent issues of the Shenbao and Xinbao newspapers. I hereby offer my humble opinion on methods for rescuing students from dropping out:

(1) Postage Surcharge: The Education Bureau should consult with the Postal Administration to collect an educational assistance donation of 50% (for example) on the delivery of letters and packages. The amount is small and will not affect the future of the postal service, and the people will surely be happy to comply. The method does not require issuing new stamps, but only adding the words "Educational Assistance Donation Paid" in blue ink to the existing stamps. For convenience, the implementation of this method can be limited to the Shanghai area only. If implemented for one month, the amount collected will be considerable, and the number of young people dropping out of school will be greatly reduced as a result.

(2) Free and Half-Price School Places: The Education Bureau should issue an order to all schools to add a certain number of free and half-price school places (the number to be determined by a special committee of the Education Bureau, depending on the financial situation of each school). The selection of free and half-price students should be based on the schools' own assessment, but subject to review by the Education Bureau to prevent abuses. Those with poor performance or those who are outwardly compliant but inwardly defiant will be given warnings or other penalties, depending on the severity of the circumstances. Conversely, they will be commended.

(3) Encourage University and Middle School Students to Open Free Schools: It is not uncommon for university and middle school students in Shanghai to establish free schools in their spare time. If they are further organized and encouraged, the results may not be inferior to those of ordinary schools, and it will also benefit the popularization of education.

### Issues Regarding Class Attendance During Air Raid Alarms

A. School Side: (1) Normal Times: 1. Class Time: From 8:45 AM to 3:00 PM. In this way, students can get up at 7:00 AM, and still have several hours after returning home in the afternoon to complete their homework. This will not increase the time students' families need to use lights, so it will not interfere with electricity conservation. 2. Rest Days: Every Sunday is a rest day, and classes are held all day on the remaining days (this point has already been implemented in several schools).

The above two points may be excepted in schools under special circumstances.

(2) When an Alarm is Issued: 1. Alert Alarm: Continue classes. 2. Air Raid Alarm: Immediately stop classes, and teachers should lead students to a safer place in the school to take shelter. At this time, students should absolutely obey the orders of their teachers. 3. Any student who is absent will not be marked as absent, and the same applies to late arrivals.

The above two points are exceptions under training alarms (second and third).

B. Student Side: (1) Normal Times: Follow school rules. (2) When an Alarm is Issued: 1. Alert Alarm: Those who have not departed should wait at home for a while, and if there are no other changes, then go to school. Those who have departed and are on the way should continue. Those who have arrived at school should attend classes at school. 2. Air Raid Alarm: Those who have not departed do not need to go to school. Those on the way should enter a shelter or a relative's home. Those who have arrived at school should follow the teacher's instructions.

The above two points are exceptions under training alarms.

If the alarm is issued at dismissal time: (1) The school should order each student to return home quickly if they live nearby, and those who live far away should stay at school. If those who live nearby disregard the order and return home, they should also stay at school. (2) Those who are on the way and live near the school should return to the school or enter a nearby shelter or relative's home.

In addition, schools must train students in air defense knowledge, especially in adapting to changing situations. As for the missed classes, they will be made up on Sundays or holidays. Are the above points agreeable to the school authorities? (Zhu Lianggou)

Those interested in studying in Nantong can request chapters and register at 1726 Taishan Road (intersection of Wuxing Road) in the Tonghai River Water Conservancy Engineering Committee in this city.

Nianci Free Elementary School: Established for many years, it strives to cultivate outstanding poor students. Mr. Li Duanxiao Bao, the chairman of the school board, recently noticed that the number of scholarships provided by the Shenbao and Xinbao newspapers is insufficient, and there are more monks than porridge. Therefore, he has set up free school places, charging only 1,500 yuan for miscellaneous fees. Registration starts today, and the exam will be held on the 22nd. School address: Intersection of Lin Yin Road on Fang Xie Road, West Gate.

Daxiong Free Night School: The classes are divided into three levels, roughly equivalent to the first, second, and third grades of junior high school.

### Financial Institutions Establish a Loan Office for Staff

The banking community in this city, in view of the extraordinary times and rising prices, and the fact that employees of industrial and commercial organizations rely solely on fixed salaries to maintain their livelihoods, already feel very constrained. If they encounter urgent needs, they will find it even more difficult to raise funds. Therefore, 14 banks initiated and agreed to collect 60 million yuan to provide low-interest loans to help those in urgent need. The first step is to target employees of industrial and commercial organizations organized as companies, and it is named the Shanghai Industrial and Commercial Staff Loan Office. The office is located at 526 Jing'an Temple Road (side door inside the Chengdu Road intersection). All loan procedures are now prepared, and applications will be accepted from 1:00 PM to 6:00 PM daily starting on the 15th. Employees of financial and industrial and commercial organizations organized as companies in the old 18 and 2 districts of this city and the Nanshi Zhabei area who have special needs in their lives can apply for loans from the office.

### Fu You Orphanage Makes an Urgent Appeal, Hoping for Generous Donations from All Sectors

The Shanghai Fu You Orphanage has been in operation for three years and has a large scale, specializing in accommodating and educating street children and orphans. In addition to introducing graduates to work in the city's industrial and commercial sectors, there are currently more than 300 children still being cared for. The teaching and management are serious, and the results are remarkable. However, the orphanage has no endowment and relies on social donations for all its expenses. At a time when everything is soaring in price, the orphanage's finances are in dire straits. If assistance is not provided quickly, the livelihoods of hundreds of children being cared for in the orphanage will inevitably become unimaginable. Therefore, from the 6th of this month, the fourth donation drive will aim to raise 10,000,000 yuan. It is hoped that people with goodwill from all sectors will donate generously and continuously so that the orphanage's relief work can continue. Then, the merits of the donors will be immeasurable. All donations from all sectors, in addition to being sent directly to the orphanage's office at Room 432, 4th Floor, Cishu Building, Nanjing Road, can also be collected and remitted by this office.
