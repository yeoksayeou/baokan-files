Establishing a Moral Nation and Society Based on the Spirit of Hakkō ichiu

Tokyo, 26th (Central News Agency Telegram) – During the plenary session of the Noble House of Japan, Count Yoshinori Futara questioned the concrete implementation of the Greater East Asia Declaration, stating that it has been over a year since the Greater East Asia Declaration, which serves as the foundation for uniting the one billion people of Greater East Asia, was proclaimed. However, there are still many inadequacies in its thorough implementation. Given the current circumstances, what specific measures does the government have to ensure that the Greater East Asia Declaration achieves practical results? Prime Minister Koiso responded as follows: Regardless of how the war situation unfolds, it is essential to firmly establish a moral nation and society based on the spirit of autonomy, independence, and Hakkō ichiu. The government authorities will ensure that Japanese military officials and civilians in various localities first embody the imperial way spirit of Hakkō ichiu themselves. They will also actively enlighten the people of allied nations in close proximity, who deeply anticipate this effort. Simultaneously, during opportunities for leaders of allied nations to visit Japan, they will engage in friendly exchanges and enthusiastically emphasize the importance of this ideal based on their own experiences, to gain their understanding and resonance, and achieve this objective.

Tokyo, 26th (Central News Agency Telegram) – At this intense stage of the war, the Japanese scientific community can easily contribute to wartime capabilities. Regarding this matter, Japanese Prime Minister Koiso emphatically stated the following during a response to questions at the general budget meeting of the House of Representatives on the 25th: The mobilization of science and technology is steadily progressing. I sincerely hope that the advancement of the scientific community can be maintained, and that we can grasp the belief in victory in this war.

Tokyo, 26th (Central News Agency Telegram) – Lieutenant General Saburo Iori, Director of the Aviation Weapons Bureau of the Japanese Ministry of Munitions, stated the following during a response to questions about aircraft production at the House of Representatives Military Financial Committee on the 26th: With the cooperation of one hundred million people, I can confidently assert that there will be no obstacles to the future of aircraft production in our country.

### Hong Kong Revises Rules for Exchanging Savings Certificates

Hong Kong, 26th (Central News Agency Telegram) – The Director of the Japanese Governor-General's Department in Hong Kong has expanded the exchange limit for Central Reserve Bank of China notes (儲劵), in order to facilitate financial circulation between Hong Kong and Guangdong. The revised exchange rules have been promulgated and implemented on the 18th. The main purpose of the revision is to ease restrictions on exchange rates and currency circulation between the two regions. Previously, the exchange of military scrip and Central Reserve Bank of China notes was limited to 500 yuan without requiring permission. This has now been increased to 1,000 yuan. The amount of military scrip and Central Reserve Bank of China notes that can be carried into the jurisdiction has also been increased from 500 yuan to 1,000 yuan. Furthermore, to strengthen self-sufficiency, active efforts are being made to mobilize and diversify production facilities. The Governor-General's Department of Commerce and Industry has decided to actively encourage the production of daily necessities for import and exchange, in addition to military supplies. The combination of exchange goods production will be promoted in a planned manner. A survey will be conducted on traders with capital of 100,000 yuan or more regarding the exchange goods they desire. Based on the results of the survey, a decision will be made on the most desired goods, and a designated factory system will be implemented according to the situation.

### Manchuria Decides to Increase Castor Bean Production This Year

Xinjing, 26th (Central News Agency Telegram) – Castor beans, being a raw material for aircraft lubricating oil and a liquid fuel like gasoline, are an important wartime fuel. Manchuria's production increase campaign yielded a total of 1,200 tons last year, a result that was not very satisfactory. Therefore, this year, the central government has decided to implement a responsibility system, with a minimum production target of 10,000 tons. The planting method will be generally the same as last year. Currently, schools, government offices, and organizations are planting as much as possible in parks, gardens, and other vacant land. The authorities will provide commendations to those with excellent results, as a form of encouragement.

### Manchuria Purchases Platinum

Xinjing, 26th (Central News Agency Telegram) – Since the Manchurian government began purchasing platinum last October, many private citizens have sold their platinum. However, there are still many who have not complied. Therefore, the Manchurian Economic Ministry announced the platinum purchase decree in December of last year, requiring all holders of platinum to sell it to the government before the end of January, or face severe penalties.

### Burmese Japanese Air Force Attacks Enemy Warships; Aerial Combat Unfolds Off Suri Island the Previous Night

From a certain Japanese military base on the Burmese front, 26th (Central News Agency Telegram) – On the night of the 25th, fighter and bomber squadrons of the Japanese air force in the Burma region attacked enemy warships landing at the northeastern tip of Suri Island, off Kavi Island. According to reports, the enemy warships consisted of two aircraft carriers, one battleship, three cruisers, and four destroyers. Aerial combat ensued, shooting down several enemy aircraft and destroying two large transport ships. All Japanese aircraft returned safely to base.

From a Sumatran base, 26th (Central News Agency Telegram) – The results of the Japanese military's engagement with enemy aircraft in the Palembang area on the 24th have now been confirmed. It is confirmed that they shot down over 70% of the incoming enemy aircraft, totaling eighty-eight. At approximately 9:30 AM on the 24th, about 120 carrier-based aircraft launched by the British Mobile Force attempted to intrude into the Palembang area. The Japanese air force, having detected the enemy's strategy in advance, launched a fierce engagement. Under intense ground fire and the skillful combat of well-trained fighter squadrons, enemy aircraft successively fell, emitting smoke. The losses of enemy aircraft are even greater, excluding the results that have not yet been returned by the Japanese pilots, which have not been determined.

### The Truth About Enemy American Aircraft Attacking Macau

Guangzhou, 26th (Central News Agency Telegram) – The truth behind the American air raid on Macau in four waves on the 16th has been investigated as follows: At 9:30 AM that morning, American aircraft intruded into Macau airspace and circled for several weeks before flying low to bomb the aircraft hangar of the New Seamount Government. They then strafed with machine guns and small cannons, before flying over the border. Ten minutes later, they attacked again, with the same target of the airfield, for about ten minutes before leaving. Shortly after, they made a third air raid, causing bombs to destroy the vicinity of the hangar. The gasoline depot at the airfield was also hit and caught fire, burning fiercely. According to Kao Sze-teh of the Secretariat, a total of 5,000 to 6,000 gallons of gasoline were destroyed. In addition to dispatching firefighters, the Macau government sent officials in the Governor's vehicle to investigate, but they were all hit by machine gun fire from the American aircraft. Furthermore, the American aircraft dropped bombs and strafed the Portuguese transport ship "Ma Shi Ti", anchored near Qiongzhou, in front of the Nam Van copper foundry. Government agencies, radio stations, and the power plant's machine shop and oil tanks on Song Mountain were also hit by bombs and strafed. The Macau authorities are extremely indignant at this unreasonable act and telegraphed Lisbon yesterday to report everything, preparing to negotiate.

### Chairman Chen's Principles of Governing the Nation

— Special Correspondent for this Newspaper, Dan Ming

Following the passing of the late Chairman Wang, the entire nation, under the leadership of Acting Chairman Chen, is entering a new stage to meet the needs of the current situation. Undoubtedly, at this decisive juncture in the world war, being able to obtain a new, strong, and resolute leader to continue to realize and further promote the unfinished aspirations of the late Chairman Wang, the prospects for the future are certainly predictable. I, the reporter, was ordered to pay respects to Acting Chairman Chen. The acting chairman received me at his official residence on Beiping Road at 4:00 PM on the 22nd of this month.

In fact, I, the reporter, was once a subordinate of Acting Chairman Chen. In my memory, Acting Chairman Chen has always seemed like a "giant of iron," like Stalin. Since he was honorably appointed as the acting chairman of the National Government, this is my first audience with him. I think most people have long known that Mr. Chen is the most practical person in our country today. He has never liked to make any empty or unrealistic discussions. I think this is the first time a news reporter has been received since he became acting chairman. When I requested a twenty-minute conversation, he agreed very readily. That kind of clear, firm demeanor is probably unmatched in China today!

Realizing the Late Chairman's Aspirations

"After the chairman led the nation into a new era of decisive battles," the reporter asked directly, "I wonder how Sino-Japanese relations will evolve?"

"Just as I said when I took office on November 20th last year," Acting Chairman Chen replied without hesitation, "I am determined to thoroughly realize the late Chairman Wang's aspirations."

"What are the so-called aspirations of the late Chairman Wang? First, it is to participate in the war. To be honest, our country's participation in the war is voluntary and has not been promoted by anyone. Why? First, our country has been invaded by Britain and the United States for a long time, and only by taking this opportunity can we make our country get rid of the tendency of being colonized; second, after our country participates in the war, it can improve its national status, express our country's determination to cooperate with the allied countries, and thus discover a new future."

"However, at this time," the reporter said, "the people's livelihood is really too hard. I don't know what kind of economic measures can be taken?"

"This is the second point I want to point out," Acting Chairman Chen continued, "In this era, we cannot talk about politics without economics. Therefore, I am determined to cooperate with the allied countries to thoroughly solve the problem of the amount of currency issuance."

"How to solve the problem of currency issuance?" the reporter asked, "Currently, the government has to increase taxes, and civil servants have to seek salary increases every day. If prices continue to rise, it may be very difficult to solve. Moreover, after the government increases taxes, it will cyclically stimulate price increases."

"That's not the most important thing," the acting chairman said with a smile, "The important thing is how to regulate currency issuance, in other words, to limit currency issuance to an appropriate level, because this issue is clearly closely related to production. I can responsibly tell you that we are now conducting practical research with the allied countries, and this problem will definitely be solved in the shortest possible time."

"The last point is peaceful unification. These three points are the late Chairman Wang's aspirations. Under any circumstances, I will definitely try to fully realize them. I have firmly told the allied countries that the unification of China must be maintained no matter what. I vow not to allow any division of China. Therefore, as long as I am in office for one day, I must do my best to completely eliminate any phenomenon of disunity, no matter how difficult the environment."

Domestic Reform

Seeing Acting Chairman Chen talking so excitedly, the reporter's spirits were also greatly lifted. Although there were other guests waiting outside, the conversation continued.

"Regarding domestic affairs," the conversation took a turn, "I wonder how the chairman will start to reorganize?"

"This is my old saying of incorruptible politics," Acting Chairman Chen said eloquently, "I have already decided to clarify officialdom in the near future."

"How will it start and how will it proceed?" I asked:

"Of course, we must take into account the actual situation," he said, "In the past, I governed Shanghai for several years, and the result was very painful to me. Because the environment there was too complicated, I did not achieve my expected goals. However, the situation here in the capital is different. I am prepared to do something thoroughly here first. I have already convened the Minister of the Army, the Commander of the Military Police, the Chief of Police, and the Mayor to discuss it. I heard that many of the military police here cannot justify themselves. I am prepared to give them a special allowance of 90 million yuan per month starting next month. If there is still corruption after next month, they will all be shot without leniency."

"The chairman's determination is exactly what Mr. Deng Sishi said about the comfort of being on a mat." The reporter interjected.

"Because it is not enough to create a good atmosphere if it is not like this."

"To create a good atmosphere," I asked again, "In addition to using severe punishment, it seems that we should also pay attention to the national morality of the whole country. I wonder what the chairman thinks of the new national movement that is currently being promoted?"

"I think," Mr. Chen replied, "The best thing to do with the new national movement is to simplify the goals and cultivate the national group action from this. The people of our country originally rarely talk about unity, which is really an important disease."

Speaking of this, the reporter reported that he was ordered to go to various places in northern Jiangsu to investigate the day after tomorrow, and perhaps he could provide him with some information on reforming county administration.

"Are you going alone?" Acting Chairman Chen was very excited when he heard this: "If you have any difficulties, you can ask for the cooperation of the local military police. When you come back, I would be very willing to hear your conclusions."

At this point, he excused himself, and in the dim twilight, the reporter, full of enthusiasm, walked out of this simple official residence.

Editorial

### Revitalizing the New Spirit of the Police

When Police Chief Zhou convened a meeting of senior police officers on the 24th, he stated (1) that he was taking office as mayor and concurrently as police chief this time with the greatest determination to rectify police affairs and that this was his only task; (2) that the police must never again cause trouble for the people or solicit bribes, otherwise, once verified, they would never be tolerated and would be severely punished; (3) that the treatment of police officers would be improved from February 1, and that the allocation of food rice would be distributed free of charge from that time, with each person receiving at least three dou, and that salaries would also be increased appropriately; (4) that the police consumer cooperative would be expanded, increasing its capital by 100 million yuan, and that the procurement and allocation work would be strengthened as much as possible, and that all kinds of daily necessities would be procured and allocated as much as possible to stabilize the lives of the police; (5) that he would prepare to issue confidential fees or travel expenses to the chiefs and deputy chiefs of the bureaus, the chiefs and deputy chiefs of the sub-bureaus, and the chiefs and deputy chiefs of the sections, in order to subsidize them.

To sum up, Police Chief Zhou's statements, item (1) is the importance and clear determination to rectify police affairs. Item (2) is a very clear warning to the police. Items (3), (4), and (5) are concrete guarantees to improve treatment. Mr. Zhou, as the head of the police, of course, bears absolute responsibility for what he said. In the future, with the police having security in their position and life, they should from now on be self-disciplined and do their best to maintain their duties. From the position of the citizens, since the authorities have made a clear statement, they should from now on transform their past dissatisfaction with the police and further supervise and assist them in order to strengthen police affairs and establish public security.

Originally, the police are the most close to the people among the civil servants, so the tasks of the police are most likely to make the people have direct impressions, and the people's belief in politics can be most effective from the service of the police. Secondly, the police are the hub of internal affairs, and most of the implementation of government orders is transmitted to the people by the police. Therefore, good government orders must be executed by good police in order to achieve good results. On the contrary, even if there are good government orders, but there are no good police, the result is reduced effectiveness. The relationship between the police and politics is so important, and the closeness to the people is also like that. Therefore, advanced countries all take improving the police as the first priority in promoting politics. For example, the allied country Japan is famous in the world for its strict and perfect police system. Today, politics is enlightened, and officials and people are united, giving full play to the power of unity. The perfection of police administration is one of the main reasons for this.

In terms of the importance of Shanghai's position and the importance of the current decisive battle situation, the police, in addition to the peacetime responsibility of being teachers and protectors of the people and promoting government orders, must also bear the wartime responsibility of maintaining public security. As Police Chief Zhou said, "The responsibility of the police is very important, especially in this wartime state. We must ensure the maintenance of local public security, directly and indirectly adapt to the wartime system, and cooperate in the total war." Therefore, the police in Shanghai are currently shouldering a dual responsibility. We not only do not have a discriminatory or disgusted psychology towards the police, but also from the beginning place great expectations and importance on them. What we were dissatisfied with in the past was the corruption of the police discipline, forgetting the duties that should have been fulfilled, and forming a widespread deterioration phenomenon. Although we have repeatedly criticized them, we have also tried our best to advocate improving treatment on the one hand and rectifying discipline on the other hand. We admit that insufficient treatment for life is indeed one of the reasons for destroying discipline. Therefore, we have also assisted the authorities in promoting the establishment of the police consumer cooperative. Now, Mayor Zhou not only verbally expressed improving treatment, but also has concrete measures and definite guarantees, which means that the reasons that formed the corruption of police discipline in the past can be eliminated from now on. Then, all the police should immediately revitalize their spirits, cherish and respect themselves, wash away the weaknesses of the past, and renew their appearance from now on, bearing in mind the importance of their own tasks, the supervision of the government, and the expectations of the people. The reduction and even disappearance of extortion phenomena in the past few days, and even the fact that citizens who offered bribes were rejected and severely reprimanded, are the best turning points for the city to get on the right track.

At the same time, we also hope that the authorities will further improve the treatment of police officers after rectifying tax collection and enriching financial resources. On the other hand, it is the great task of the middle and senior police officers, and also the glory of all police personnel, to instill new knowledge and skills into the police, improve the wartime understanding of the police, and make everyone a modern police officer, so as to fulfill the wartime responsibility.

### Thailand Commemorates Entry into the War, Ambassador Yamamoto Speaks

Bangkok, 26th (Central News Agency Telegram) – It has been three years since Thailand declared war on the United States and Britain. On the 25th of this month, the third anniversary of the entry into the war was commemorated. On this day, both Japan and Thailand expressed their determination to complete the war in Bangkok. At 10:00 AM, the Japanese ambassador visited Thai Foreign Minister Sirisena, and Ambassador Yamamoto made a reply, saying that the Thai people, with strong determination and patience, are closely cooperating with Japan and are determined to complete the great cause. In order to achieve the common goal, they will do their best. Therefore, no matter what difficulties and sacrifices there may be in the future, they will continue together until the final victory. Three years have passed since the entry into the war, and today our goal is even clearer. This war is a great war that determines the fate of East Asia. When the final goal is successfully achieved, our nations can establish a peaceful world based on the morality clarified at the Greater East Asia Conference. We will grasp this morality and vow to march towards the path of defeating the enemy.

### Chairman Bose Expresses Ardent Hopes for the Indian People

Yangon, 26th (Central News Agency Telegram) – Taking the opportunity of Bose's stay in Yangon, the Indian Independence League held a mass rally in Yangon on the 23rd, Bose's 47th birthday, to further uplift the determination of Myanmar and India to strive for independence. In addition to blessing Bose's health, they also promoted the spirit of the Indians in East Asia to gather their material and spiritual strength to strive for freedom. Bose explained the trend of the world war at the rally, especially emphasizing the bravery of the Japanese special attack teams, and stating that the time for the Axis powers' offensive has arrived, and expressed his strong belief in achieving final victory. He also earnestly hoped that all Indians must emulate the special attack spirit of the Japanese army, eliminate all difficulties in the future of the war, and exert their total strength until they achieve final victory.

### The Outcome of Germany's War Determines the Fate of Europe, Goebbels is Confident that He Can Stop the Flood

Berlin, 26th (Central News Agency Telegram) – Hai Tong News Agency reports: German Propaganda Minister Goebbels published an article in the latest issue of "Germany Weekly" stating that the Eastern Front's flood will eventually be contained. Even if the enemy tries to contain it on the Western Front in many ways, we will build a dike to resist the grasslands of Ryukyu in order to save ourselves and the civilization of the whole world. The large-scale offensive of the Soviet army has now exposed the great crisis for the entire European continent, that is, its direct attack on Central Europe and its indirect attack on Western Europe. If the German army cannot contain its advance, the consequences can be easily imagined. This not only concerns the whole of Europe, but also the whole of mankind. Therefore, Germany is fighting for the world today, and its outcome can directly or indirectly affect the fate of civilized people, because the Soviet Union now wants to use violence to make the world a Communist International. Therefore, if Germany can win this war, it will create a new era for all mankind. If it loses, the end of the West will come.

### Japanese Tunnel Technology: Worthy of Boasting to the World

Tokyo, 26th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese National Railways authorities, in light of the recent war situation, have found it necessary for civil engineering technicians to organize underground construction units to undertake the regional construction of important domestic facilities. Michiya Tetsudo, who has been appointed Deputy Director of the Underground Construction Headquarters, recently stated that Japan's tunnel technology is truly worthy of boasting to the world. The most powerful proof of this is the completion of the Tanna Tunnel, overcoming numerous difficulties, including the high pressure associated with volcanic areas, and completing the world's most difficult project. Furthermore, the recent completion of the tunnel is also due to the indomitable spirit of the Japanese technological community. The advancements in Japanese National Railways tunnel technology are truly astonishing. This technological community, now mobilizing its full capabilities and undertaking underground construction, deserves the close attention of the nation's citizens.

### German Government Denies Rumors

### Price Ceiling Set for Essential Goods in the Capital, Including Rice, Firewood, Salt, Oil, and Seven Other Items

Nanjing, 26th (Central News Agency) - To stabilize prices in the capital, the central authorities have decided to establish a "Capital Essential Goods Price Stabilization Committee." Starting with seven essential goods for daily life in the capital city area, including rice, firewood, oil, salt, vegetables, pork, chicken, duck, and fish, the committee will adhere to the principles of "resolving issues immediately" and "eliminating harm upon detection." It will also employ strict supervision and rigorous enforcement to thoroughly achieve the goal of ensuring smooth supply and stabilizing prices. This measure by the authorities will greatly benefit the improvement of people's livelihoods. It is expected that the prices of essential goods in the capital city area will, in addition to the inevitable increase due to general wartime factors, be able to quickly return to a normal state. The congestion of general goods will also be alleviated, leading to prices falling from high levels to more stable ones. The implementation plan for the seven essential goods is currently being carefully discussed and decided upon by relevant parties. Among them, the rice price is the most important. In the future, the committee plans to revise the rice control measures, lift the city gate blockade, and remove the restrictions on the amount of rice that can be brought into the city per kilogram, so that rice from outside the city can be transported into the city without hindrance. Furthermore, rice from the five nearby counties that usually supply Nanjing, namely Jiangning, Jurong, Lishui, Jiangpu, and Liuhe, as well as rice from He County, Hanshan, Xuancheng, Wuhu, Dangtu, Gaowan, Wuwei, and Chaoxian in Anhui Province, will also be allowed to be freely transported to the capital. In the past, "rigid price limits" often caused rice merchants to lose money, which in turn obstructed supply. The committee has decided to improve this measure as well. The price limits will be carefully researched and publicly discussed by relevant agencies responsible for price assessment, taking into account the true costs and legitimate profits, so that they can be rationalized. Once the committee's rice control measures are revised, anyone, whether official or civilian, who intends to profit by hoarding and manipulating the market to disrupt supply and demand will be punished by death in accordance with Article 17 of the Wartime Criminal Special Law. Therefore, it is earnestly hoped that citizens will exercise self-discipline, cooperate with the authorities in this measure, and work together to complete the wartime economic system and achieve the goal of stabilizing people's livelihoods.

### US Army and Navy Casualties Exceed 710,000

Lisbon, 26th (Central News Agency) - According to a San Francisco dispatch: US Surgeon General Kirk stated in an interview with reporters in San Francisco on the 24th that the total number of American wounded soldiers on all fronts is approximately 100,000 per month, of which 35,000 are sent back to the country, and the rest are treated in front-line hospitals and return to their original units after recovery.

US War Expenses Increase Sharply This Year

### Soviet Union Borrows Large Sum from American Businesses

Lisbon, 26th (Central News Agency) - Huitong News Agency: The New York Times reported that the Soviet authorities have borrowed $6 billion from the US government to purchase machinery for the postwar reconstruction of Soviet industry.

### Fierce Battles on Eastern Front's Flanks; German Positions Solid; Soviet Forces Establish Bridgehead on Warta River's West Bank

Berlin, 26th (Central News Agency) - Huitong News Agency: A German military spokesman commented on the situation on the Eastern Front yesterday, predicting that the Breslau area may develop into a major battle in the coming days. He also stated that the Red Army's attacks on Namslau and Oels have been repelled so far, but fierce fighting outside Breslau city seems unavoidable. Although Soviet forces occupied Ober-Glogau and crossed the Warta River, establishing two small bridgeheads on the west bank, their attempts to cross the river have been thwarted by fierce battles. Kosel, Altheidelberg, and Heydebreck are still in German hands, and the Soviet vanguard forces that broke into these areas have been repelled. Soviet forces also attacked the Wohlau area from the south and east in the Posen region, but were also repelled. Soviet forces attacked Schrimm from the northeast of Posen, and another tank force entered the city of Zempelburg, but were also repelled by German forces.

Fierce Street Fighting in Bromberg

Berlin, 26th (Central News Agency) - German News Agency: Soviet forces in the Posen region have greatly increased pressure on Bromberg and have repeatedly attempted to cross the Netze River, but were repelled and suffered heavy losses. Fierce street fighting is taking place in Bromberg day and night. Although German forces once drove the enemy to the southernmost tip of the city, they were soon forced to retreat to prepared positions.

Special Significance of Containment Strategy

Berlin, 26th (Central News Agency) - Huitong News Agency: Strategically observing the battles on the flanks of the Eastern Front has special significance. German forces on both sides are holding back Soviet forces, preventing them from launching large-scale offensives between the Beskid Mountains and Kovel. German reinforcements launched a surprise attack northwest of Hondo, forcing the main Soviet forces to retreat to the Danube River. The defending forces fighting fiercely in Hondo are also holding back a considerable number of Soviet forces. The German forces fighting fiercely in the Kuran area are preventing the 25th Soviet Division under Bagratian from participating in the war east of East Prussia. The Soviet commander is therefore unable to use the Gulf of Riga as a naval base, which is also of great significance. There is a major battle between Kulakov and Königsberg, and there have been no major changes in the military situation in 24 hours.

Major Battle Raging in East Prussia

Soviet forces are attempting to completely cut off East Prussia. Their strategy has two parts: (1) Soviet tank units and mechanized units are charging into the area south of Mohrungen from Deutsch Eylau. As a result of the German forces' counterattacks on both flanks, fierce battles have broken out. (2) Main Soviet forces are attacking from the Bromberg-Thorn line, attempting to reach Danzig. Although Soviet forces have broken into Bromberg, they have not been able to develop their original plan. The battles in the Bromberg Canal and the Upper Silesian industrial area are extremely fierce. The number of Soviet troops continues to increase, and German reinforcements have also been transferred to the front to stop the enemy's advance. There are major battles northeast of the industrial area east of Breslau, especially in the Posen region. German positions are becoming increasingly fortified.

### New Yugoslav Flag Appears

Political Crisis Remains

Lisbon, 26th (Central News Agency) - Huitong News Agency, New York Dispatch: The new flag of Yugoslavia, featuring a Soviet star on a white background, has been raised on Yugoslav cargo ships in New York Harbor. It is reported that the Yugoslav Minister of Transport has notified all Yugoslav ships to do so. The anti-Axis countries have also been notified of this.

Lisbon, 26th (Central News Agency) - German News Agency, London News: Yugoslav Prime Minister-in-exile Subasic met with King Peter of Yugoslavia for the third time last night, and the cabinet also held its second cabinet meeting. The Yugoslav government-in-exile announced that a final decision has not yet been reached, but the atmosphere of the negotiations is still harmonious, and there is a possibility of compromise.

Stockholm, Sweden, 26th (Central News Agency) - Huitong News Agency: British Dominions Secretary Lord Cranborne declared to the Upper House that if the Yugoslav government-in-exile and the National Liberation Committee cannot reach an agreement, there is a risk of civil war.

### German Army's Major Offensive on the Western Front

The new German offensive, which began in mid-December last year, progressed very smoothly. At that time, international telephone connections in Berlin were disrupted, and telegram communications were also very difficult. It was not until the evening of December 21 that the Tokyo Asahi Shimbun was able to communicate with its Berlin branch office, and the true situation of the German offensive became clear. The following is a translation of the conversation between the Asahi Shimbun and Mr. Moriyama, the head of its Berlin branch office.

Result of Thorough Mobilization

Headquarters: Germany has finally launched an offensive. It started when the British and American forces were fiercely attacking the Siegfried Line without success and were running out of ammunition and manpower. It's truly amazing. In terms of timing and location, it's indeed very good.

Moriyama: Not only do we think so, but the German people also know that defense alone cannot win, and they believe that the German army will definitely launch an offensive. Ever since the German army withdrew from the Cotentin Peninsula in the summer of 1944, they had been saying that one day the German army would definitely take the offensive. Sure enough, it finally launched on December 16. Everyone is very pleased. This offensive is the largest offensive in the two years since the Battle of Stalingrad, so the general German people have high expectations for it. It can be said that the fate of Germany depends on this move, so Germany is pouring all its efforts into this offensive. This offensive can be regarded as the result of Germany's thorough mobilization since August last year.

The Goal of the Silent Offensive

Headquarters: Is this offensive a so-called defensive offensive to defend the Siegfried Line?

Moriyama: According to German newspapers, it is to defend German territory and drive the enemy out of the country. However, simply driving the enemy out of the country is not enough to turn the tide of the war, so it is necessary to annihilate the enemy's forces, at least one or two army corps. Perhaps the German army wants to completely annihilate the enemy in the Aachen area, but there is no news about this in German newspapers, and they are not easily making predictions about the future, so this offensive can be said to be a "silent offensive." The reason why Germany is so silent is to prove its reports and propaganda with powerful facts.

Headquarters: In this offensive, Germany has put the results of its thorough mobilization into the front line as combat power, right?

Moriyama: That's for sure. Since the summer of 1944, Germany has implemented thorough mobilization, and as a result, it has a surplus of manpower. In the past, anyone who participated in important industries could be exempted from military service, but now all men between the ages of twenty and thirty-four are being drafted. Even if they have not been completely drafted, at least tens of percent have been, which can increase the number of soldiers by no small amount, at least several hundred thousand. As for domestic enterprises, of course, women will have to be used to replace them, and work efficiency may be somewhat lower. However, such thorough mobilization can always form a large army, at least several divisions!

Headquarters: If the national power gained through thorough mobilization is used in this offensive, wouldn't there be a concern that there will be no one to follow up in case of a major setback?

Moriyama: That is a real question, and we think so too. However, the German people will definitely make this offensive a success. According to them, the fate of the country depends entirely on the outcome of this offensive, and they have the spirit to make it a success no matter what. Because this offensive is the result of Germany's total war effort, its success or failure will have a major impact on the future, not only militarily but also politically. However, since the commander-in-chief is Field Marshal Rundstedt, he certainly would not launch an offensive without a clear plan, so this is something to be reassured about.

New Weapons Appear One After Another

Headquarters: This operation has been going very smoothly. What is the reason?

Moriyama: What has been showing extraordinary activity in the new offensive is the fighter squadron and tanks. Many of the tanks used by the German army this time are the latest models, different from the Tiger tanks that were active on the battlefield in the past. In addition, the paratroopers who landed behind enemy lines were also successful. The German parachutes are completely dyed black and used for night attacks, displaying extraordinary power. Moreover, there seems to be a major new transformation in tactics that is different from the past. In short, one reason for the success of this new offensive in achieving surprise is that the preparations for the attack and the operational plan were able to be kept secret. For example, the enemy on that front was very careless, while the German army was waiting with bated breath. As soon as the counter-offensive began, it attacked like a raging wave. Just as the American army was preparing to eat breakfast, German tanks suddenly appeared. Especially the US First Army, which had been most active since landing in Normandy and was quite proud of itself, ran into a snag this time. They were suddenly shocked by the German attack and panicked, not knowing what to do. (Translated from the December 3 Asahi Shimbun)

### Eliminating Embezzlement and Reorganizing Municipal Tax Revenue: Mayor Zhou Addresses Financial Bureau Officials

Yesterday morning (the 26th) at 10:00 AM, Mayor Zhou Fohai convened a meeting in the Municipal Government's reception room to address officials of the Municipal Finance Bureau at the rank of Senior Clerk and above, including the heads of each division, section chiefs, inspectors, and specialists. Present were approximately 30 people, including Luo Junqiang, the concurrently serving Director of Finance; Xu Songping, the Chief Secretary; Cai Yanbin, a secretary; Zhu Wenyuan, the Chief of the General Affairs Section; Cai Wu, the Head of Accounting; Chen Junde, the Director of the Special Tax Bureau; and Yang Xiaofo, the Director of the Ma Chang Road Office. After inquiring about the backgrounds of each senior official, Mayor Zhou delivered an earnest and clear speech that moved all who listened. The original text is recorded below:

Significant Mission

"With this reorganization of the Municipal Government, I hope to bring about reforms to Shanghai's municipal administration and do something for the people. To reform municipal administration, or to do anything, we must first rectify discipline and establish a clean and honest government. But first, we must consider the issue of compensation. To ensure everyone is honest, we must increase everyone's compensation. However, the ability to increase compensation depends on whether or not the finances are sound. And to ensure the finances are sound, it depends on whether you all can work diligently in your positions. Therefore, the mission you shoulder is not only about fulfilling your own duties, but also about bearing the significant responsibility of establishing a clean and honest atmosphere. It can be said that your responsibilities are even greater than those of personnel in other departments.

Eliminating Embezzlement

Since Director Luo took office, there have been no changes to the Finance Bureau's personnel. In the past, I have heard many negative things about you all from various sources. I hope that you will resolutely eliminate those negative aspects of the past. To ensure the finances are sound, we must increase revenue. However, under the current circumstances, raising tax rates is not only impossible, but I also do not want to increase the burden on the people. Now, we can only reorganize tax revenue based on the principle of eliminating embezzlement and turning private gain into public benefit. I believe that if we can properly reorganize the existing tax revenue and ensure that the money that was originally embezzled is entirely returned to the public treasury, we can increase the amount of tax revenue even without increasing taxes. If the amount of taxes borne by the people and the amount of revenue received by the government are not too different, but if there is a big difference, it means that the financial personnel are unsound. We must ensure that the distance between the two is not too great. Aside from the necessary administrative expenses, there should be no other expenses. Only in this way can the amount borne by the people and the amount actually received by the government be closer.

Future Efforts

For more than five years, I was responsible for the entire finances of the National Government, and I made every effort to do so with a sincere attitude. Until now, not only has the government's finances not been in deficit, but the amount left in the national treasury has increased to more than 300 million yuan. This is not to say that there was no corruption or other improprieties in the past, but overall, it can be considered relatively acceptable. If we make further efforts, the country's revenue can certainly be increased. Now, I am extending the spirit of the former Ministry of Finance to the municipal Finance Bureau. The reason for asking Secretary-General Luo to concurrently serve as Director is because Director Luo is strict, fair, and capable. I hope that under his leadership, you will reform the various shortcomings of the past and work hard in your future duties. Although you have not worked under Director Luo in the past, Director Luo does not think that you cannot work together because you were not his subordinates in the past. This is like a capable general who must not only be able to lead his own troops to fight, but also be able to lead other people's troops to fight. That is what counts as an outstanding general. For example, the French General Napoleon was good at utilizing this point. Therefore, it is not necessary for only one's own people to be able to do things. If you can treat people with an open attitude, even if they are not your subordinates, they can still exert great effects. You are all experienced personnel, and you have many opportunities to work hard. If you can use your past good experience and work hard for the public good, you will certainly be able to fulfill a great responsibility for the country. If you use it in a bad way, you can do bad things and cause bad things to happen. It depends on whether you can work hard under the leadership of Director Luo and exert the greatest effect.

Increased Compensation

In the future, whether municipal administration can be done well and whether clean and honest politics can be achieved depends largely on you. Since your responsibilities are so great, I have recently discussed with Director Luo and decided that the compensation of financial personnel should be specially increased compared to other staff, because their responsibilities are particularly heavy, and their compensation should naturally be specially increased. Because their responsibilities are heavy, I especially hope that you will work doubly hard. This will enable Shanghai's financial system to be completely renewed. However, if, after the special increase in compensation, you still have other illegal actions or illegal things happening, then there is no need to consider anything else. You will be severely punished by law. I am declaring in advance that I will not tolerate or forgive such illegal people. This is not to intentionally make alarmist statements. To rectify discipline and establish a clean and honest atmosphere, it must be done this way. At the same time, I hope that you will convey my words to the lower-level staff and encourage each other."

Under the supervision of Team Leader Sun, along with Detective Section Chief Zhu Zheng and other staff members, they departed separately to pursue the case. That night, they raided a hiding place of stolen goods, and recovered a large number of stolen steel, round steel, and steel plates at the Yongtai Steel Company on Qiujiang Road. However, the shop owner Xu Liang and the thieves had fled upon hearing the news.

### Enemy American Attempt to Land in China Factually Impossible Saltada Captain Denounces Rumor Mongers

Following usual practice, the Naval Fleet Press Department of the Japanese Government held a meeting with newspaper reporters from this city yesterday (the 26th) at 2:00 PM. Minister Matsushima had not returned to Shanghai due to official business in Japan. Captain Saltada continued to represent the Department and critically analyzed the recent rumors spreading in the city that enemy American forces were planning to bomb Taiwan, Guangzhou, Fuzhou, Xiamen, and even Jinshanwei in order to first conduct a landing. Captain Saltada pointed out that those rumors were groundless and did not deserve the attention of informed people. The main points of the conversation were as follows:

Enemy Americans Unable to Land in China

It would be surprising that the enemy is using China as a place to start a landing but there is no possibility in fact. If they wanted to make this attempt, they would have to break up the Japanese supplement line first, and then start the bombing of Philippines, but it is not easy. If the enemy wants to land, where are the troops? New Guinea and the Philippines can’t be drawn out, so they want to make an attempt elsewhere but its constrained. Southern China and Hainan are important bases for Japanese troops. The air defense installations are very solid, even if the enemy comes, it will be difficult to succeed. Especially in Taiwan, if the enemy does not get their hands on it, then the war will not continue.

Starting Rumors Worth a Smile

Speculate on the one who started rumors. The one who started the rumor, its purpose is to profit and to disrupt the peace. There is no factual basis that the rumors were started from, and the rumors is not worth of a smile. The rumor of the US military coming up from Hangzhou bay happened during the second bombing of Taiwan and those who created the rumor are heard of the bombing of Taiwan, the latter is made to attach with the former. There are those that say the landing point is not one, and there are a lot of aspects to the rumor, and another say the US military is landing at Lianyungang. There are a lot of rumors. US military landing must see how the war in Philippines goes, otherwise it is very dangerous. Japanese prepared in southern China for strong and force defense.

Details of Attack on Shanghai Warplanes

Captain Tian Dawei also made a statement on the results of the recent battle between the US aircraft attacking Shanghai and the Japanese Air Force: On the 17th, more than a dozen enemy planes attacked Shanghai, and the Japanese shot down seven planes and destroyed five. Two Chinese civilians were killed or injured. This time, the Japanese Air Force's counterattack achieved excellent results, which was unprecedented. The air defense training of citizens has also greatly improved. There is no longer the previous situation where many people were killed or injured due to arbitrary observation. This is fortunate. The enemy planes that attacked Shanghai this time were in formations of two or three, and they used machine guns to strafe downwards in the air. Fortunately, no civilians were killed. The work of searching for the crash sites of the enemy planes and their wreckage is still underway. One fuselage was found on the ground in the southwest of Guipu, lightly burned, and the pilot was killed. One plane was also found in the Wu County area. Residents of the Nanshi area witnessed three American planes crashing in the far south, but the location of the crash is unknown. Enemy planes were also shot down southwest of Hongqiao, but the wreckage has not yet been found. Every time enemy planes come to attack, Japanese planes will take off to intercept them. Citizens sometimes mistakenly think that they are American planes. The Japanese planes have red markings on both wings, which can be distinguished. At present, the air defense in Shanghai has further improved. If American planes come to attack again in the future, they will suffer great losses.

Zhongbei played with an ideal lineup last night, consisting of Chen Xuechong, Shen Yucong, Li Zhenzhong, Zhuo Guorong, and Bao Songyuan, completely resembling the Chinese national team, stable and confident.

### Shanghai Citizens Welfare Association's Appeal for Donations for Winter Relief

This Association, aware that there are many extremely poor and hidden poor among the citizens of Shanghai, especially in these times, there is a necessity for relief, and after consultation, has decided to raise 50 million yuan to purchase grains and handle price stabilization. Subsequently, the Municipal Government established the Winter Relief Committee, and most of the members of this Association participated in the work of the Winter Relief Committee. For example, Chen Riping, a director of this Association, is the Deputy Director of the Winter Relief Committee. After further consultation, in order to save on administrative expenses, it was entrusted to the Winter Relief Committee. In order to handle it quickly, we first consulted with the Central Reserve Bank authorities to assist in borrowing the entire 50 million yuan, which was then handed over to the Winter Relief Committee for distribution. The Winter Relief Committee has first organized three temporary relief projects. However, the loan is agreed to be repaid in three installments, with the first installment due on February 10th, which is fast approaching. The Board of Directors of this Association has decided to entrust the Xin Shen two newspapers to publicly raise funds. We respectfully hope that the wealthy and charitable people at sea will generously donate to benefit the poor people. If you wish to donate, please send it directly to the Social Service Department of the Xin Shen two newspapers for collection. The titles of the donors will be published in the Xin Shen two newspapers in succession.

### Peach and Plum Trees All Over the Land

Hoping Enthusiastic People Will Do Their Utmost to Provide Relief

The ancients used the term "peach and plum" to describe worthy individuals. Later generations praised educators with numerous students, also saying "peach and plum fill the gate." The "Han Shi Waizhuan" mainly says, "In spring, plant peach and plum trees, and in summer you can enjoy their shade beneath, and in autumn, eat their fruits. In spring, plant tribulus, and in summer you cannot gather its leaves, and in autumn you get its thorns." This means that "peach and plum" give great benefits to people's lives. In summer, peach and plum trees grow luxuriantly, and people can enjoy the coolness under the trees. In autumn, the fruits are abundant, providing people with food. Not only that, but the peach and plum blossoms in spring are also very beautiful, providing enjoyment. As for "tribulus," it also grows in spring, but its branches and leaves have thorns and cannot be used, simply a harmful thing. Speaking of the five thousand impoverished students sponsored by this newspaper, all are in the top third of their classes and recommended by the principals. Of course, they are the most outstanding "peach and plum," not "tribulus." They are currently studying in elementary school, junior and senior high school, vocational school, and even university, scattered in schools throughout Shanghai. In another ten or twenty years, they will certainly be scattered throughout the country, working hard to revitalize and build the nation, so it is said, "peach and plum trees all over the land." Unfortunately, they are currently trapped by their family circumstances and unable to attend school. We hope that wealthy and powerful, enthusiastic people will generously donate and fulfill their responsibility to provide relief and assistance.

Major pharmacies and the four major department stores in the city all sell them. The original special price is 3,800 yuan per set. Now, we specially enclose ten sets, and we request you to determine the price and sell them on our behalf. The proceeds from the sale will be donated in full to the student aid fund organized by your newspaper, so as to benefit society." (Note) The donated ten "Health Medicine Depots" have been sent to the charity bazaar jointly organized by the Youth Association and the four organizations, for a scheduled public charity sale. We express our sincere gratitude."

### Strengthening the Security of the City's Suburbs

— Dezhi

In the past, all facilities of the Shanghai authorities were focused on the urban area, while the counties and suburbs belonging to this city have not been properly constructed since the war, and even the most fundamental security issues have not been fully established. I believe that the counties and suburbs are equally important, so I hope the authorities will rectify them.

First: Shanghai's population has long exceeded the saturation point, and it should be dispersed as soon as possible. The suburbs are relatively convenient and easy to disperse to.

Second: Future air battles are bound to be fierce, and some industries and the elderly and weak in Shanghai are best evacuated to the suburbs.

Third: The soaring prices and scarcity of goods have reached the most serious stage. Prices in the suburbs are lower, and life is easier. Impoverished people should go there as soon as possible.

Fourth: Recently, various music groups have laid off a large number of employees, and the number of unemployed will increase even more. The suburban agricultural production has always been abundant, and the labor of the unemployed can be used to increase production.

The above four points are sufficient to prove the importance of the suburbs, but because security cannot be established, we earnestly hope that the municipal authorities will strengthen the security of the suburbs to promote the evacuation work.

First: Reorganize the Baojia system. The Baojia organization in the suburbs is mostly nominal, the household registration is inaccurate, and the heads of the districts, townships, towns, Bao, and Jia are particularly ineffective. Therefore, the candidates for Baojia chiefs should be strictly selected and then trained, implement a general household registration review, and conduct random checks at any time.

Second: Enhance the strength of the police force. The treatment of police and security teams in the suburbs is extremely low, and the police force is inevitably scattered. Therefore, police expenses must be planned, salaries increased, and unqualified personnel eliminated, and new cadres trained to replenish the police force and enrich equipment.

Third: Universally set up self-defense. Each township should train young men to universally form self-defense groups and patrol teams to help each other and make up for the shortage of police force.

Fourth: Eliminate drugs and gambling. The prevalence of gambling in the suburbs is rampant, which harms the people and wastes wealth. There is nothing more serious than this, and it has a major impact on security. It should be eradicated as soon as possible.

Fifth: Eliminate the violent and protect the good. There is no shortage of local tyrants and evil gentry in the townships who rely on special forces to extort and fleece the people. These bad elements must be cracked down on. If there is collusion between the military and police to do evil, they must be brought to justice, so that the good people can live and work in peace and contentment.

### Elementary School Advanced Training Association Adds a Welfare Group

The elementary school teachers' winter vacation advanced training association has been open for three days since the lectures began, and the male and female teachers who go to listen to the lectures every day are very enthusiastic. Recently, in order to meet general needs, a welfare group has been added, which is divided into health checkups, job referrals, etc. The job referral section is particularly busy, and dozens of people have registered one after another, and more than a dozen schools have entrusted them to find talent. If schools still want to hire teachers, they can directly send a letter to this office or the Shanghai Transfer Elementary School Advanced Training Association on Xindagu Road. Also, on the afternoon of the 24th, in order to review elementary school life, experts were specially invited to hold a symposium on elementary school life issues, and it is planned to request the government to give priority to allocating various daily necessities, in order to obtain a minimum level of living guarantee, so that everyone can work with peace of mind, and achieve the goal of improving educational efficiency and benefiting the nation.

### Zhenjiang Native Association Student Aid Fund Registration Will Close

The student aid fund for impoverished Zhenjiang native children, sponsored by the Zhenjiang Shanghai Native Association in this city, has always been limited to those studying below the high school level. There have been university students with excellent grades and impoverished families who have come to the association to request special subsidies, but it is impossible to accept them due to the regulations. It is now known that Mr. Tang Shoumin founded the China Business Vocational School, located in the Jiaotong Bank building on Jing'an Temple Road. The tuition fee is only 10,000 yuan, which is much cheaper than other universities. If Zhenjiang native children are studying in business high schools and other schools and cannot afford to attend, they can ask the association to request Mr. Tang Shoumin to recommend them for free or reduced fees to provide assistance. It is also heard that the registration of old students held by the association has been decided to close on the 28th of this month and will not be extended. All Zhenjiang native children in Shanghai who plan to continue their studies in the next semester can immediately bring their supporting documents and quickly apply to the association at No. 3 Zhifu Road, Zhejiang Road intersection, second floor.

### Student Aid and Small Loans

The student aid and small capital loans organized by Anhua Bank began to be applied for on the 21st. On that morning, no less than two hundred young students waited at the door. The person in charge of the bank successively interviewed them, and the order was in good order. Those who passed the interview were given an application form by the bank, and they were required to fill it out and submit it within two days for review. It is heard that the amount of student aid organized by the bank this time includes all tuition and miscellaneous fees. Once approved, the bank will directly pay the school on behalf of the students, which is a great benefit to impoverished students. The number of applicants for small capital loans is relatively small, probably because not many people currently know that the bank is organizing small capital loans. The bank is still continuing to accept applications for the above-mentioned small capital loans, while applications for student aid will close at 20:00 on Saturday.

Address: 54 Shanxi Road.

The Shanghai South City Citizens Welfare Association, in order to meet the actual needs of the common people, has specially organized small capital loans to provide livelihood opportunities for impoverished people. It is heard that the application procedures for this loan will start immediately, divided into two types: 2,000 yuan and 4,000 yuan, which can be divided into ten installments to repay the principal without any fees or interest. Impoverished people in Nanshi who have a legitimate need for loans and have reliable shop guarantees can apply to the association at No. 99 Jinjiafang, Nanshi.

### Alumni Advanced Training Association Launches a Variety Show

Recently, in response to this newspaper's student aid and poverty relief, it launched a variety show, inviting the ticket office of the First Special District Office and the Yisheng Opera Troupe to perform Peking Opera and modern drama, as well as movie stars Bai Guang, Fei Qiuxia, Bai Hong, etc. to sing. It is scheduled to be performed gratuitously at the Jincheng Grand Theater on February 24th, and the Shanghai Radio Station will broadcast it to the city at that time.

### Teacher Training Class

The Education College of Huadong University, in view of the low level of teachers and the decline in teaching efficiency, in order to facilitate general educators or in-service teachers who are interested in education to have the opportunity to improve, has expanded its scope and established a teacher training class, inviting famous professors to give lectures, and universally providing free academic places. Detailed information can be obtained from the school at No. 302 Baike Road (intersection of Huanghe Road).

### New Star Medicine Aid Movement

### Cough Relief Elixir Continues Charity Sale

Mr. Sun Bonan, who studied medicine at St. John's University in his early years and is now teaching at a certain university, always suffers from coughs every winter, which repeatedly heal and relapse. He has extensively collected the advantages of Western medicine and created a "Cough Relief Elixir" Cucilin, which is made purely with American raw materials and is specially used to treat various coughs, such as bronchitis, phlegm asthma, and whooping cough in children, with miraculous effects. It was first sold in the education sector and was highly praised by teachers and students. Recently, it has been noted that the number of people suffering from this disease is increasing day by day, but because the price of medicine is expensive, they are unable to purchase it and delay treatment, suffering deeply. Therefore, two dozen bottles are donated for charity sale, which have already been sold out. Now, three dozen more bottles are sent for continued charity sale. The selling price is 350 yuan per bottle. After recovering the cost of 250 yuan, the remaining 100 yuan will be donated to this office's medical aid fund to save the poor and sick.

### Nursing Home Appeals for Donations of Old Horse-Drawn Carriages

The nuns of the nursing home go out to beg for alms every day, regardless of wind and rain. Every morning, a tired horse can be seen pulling a worn-out carriage, rattling through the vegetable market streets. Whatever they get, they load it on the teacher. This is the old horse-drawn carriage placed in the nursing home. Because of the lack of funds, the nuns run around, and the need for the car is even more frequent. If there is a time for distribution, it must also be used to carry goods. Therefore, only one vehicle is not enough. A certain German expatriate knew this and generously donated a good horse. However, having a horse without a car is still useless. Therefore, we appeal to benevolent gentlemen to donate old horse-drawn carriages, regardless of style, all are welcome, so that both beauty and practicality can be achieved, complementing each other. If you are willing to donate, please indicate the address of the hospital at No. 39 Jichang Street, and this office can also contact you.
