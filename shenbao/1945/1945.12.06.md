### Shenyang Within a Day's Journey: National Army Awaits Soviet Withdrawal

[United Press, Chongqing, 5th] Military authorities today told United Press that General Du Yuming's vanguard of the National Army, advancing towards the Northeast, has crossed Xinmin and is now at a location "within a day's journey" from Shenyang.

[Reuters, Jin County, 5th] General Du Yuming, Commander of the Northeast Security Forces, is currently awaiting the Soviet withdrawal from Jiyang before entering the city. Regarding his inability to enter Shenyang due to the Soviet Union's continued presence, Du stated yesterday: "The Soviet side agreed on November 20th that Shenyang should be opened up to allow our entry. I am still waiting." He added that the Soviet Ambassador to China promised on November 24th to withdraw from Shenyang and hand it over to the National Army. Therefore, he is waiting for the Soviet side to fulfill this promise. Vice Admiral Barbey, Commander of the US Seventh Fleet, the first US official envoy to enter the Eastern Provinces, yesterday discussed the supply of the National Army, transport, and naval assistance with General Du Yuming in this city.

[United Press, Chongqing, 5th] The National Army is advancing along the Beining Railway, and its vanguard has crossed Xinmin today, approaching Shenyang. Xinmin is only ninety *li* from Shenyang. According to Chinese telegrams, Xiong Shihui, Director of the Northeast Headquarters, declared in Chongqing that the National Army will continue to advance until the entire country is recovered.

[United Press, Jinzhou, 5th] The National Army continues to advance towards Shenyang, encountering almost no resistance from the Communist forces. Although people have repeatedly speculated that a major war would break out in the Northeast, no such war has yet materialized. It is doubtful whether the National Army's vanguard, since crossing the Great Wall, has suffered more than one hundred casualties. The reason the National Army is achieving significant results at such a small price is that the Communist forces cannot establish a foothold by force. According to Secretary-General Yu of the Northeast Security Command, "The Nine Eastern Provinces are not fertile ground for Communism. Some areas of China do have a few farmers who resist local oppressive taxes and are driven by the Communist Party. Communist officers recruit troops in North China, forcibly conscripting farmers, but the farmers are fickle and perform poorly in combat, fleeing back to their fields at the first opportunity. Communist officers can only recruit bandits and engage in sabotage, but they are not enough to confront our large army."

[United Press, Chongqing, 5th] Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Liu Kai today declared that negotiations between China and the Soviet Union on the air transport of the National Army to Shenyang and Changchun, and the handover of administrative authority in the nine northeastern provinces and cities, will be concluded within a few days. When asked by a reporter whether the National Army advancing by land was allowed to enter Shenyang, Liu replied, "I have never said it is impossible." Minister of Propaganda Wu Guozhen stated, "I have not paid attention to rumors of Zhang Xueliang's release. He is not actually under detention."

The people's psychology is also stable, but they are still waiting for the arrival of the National Army, like children waiting for the New Year. The weather here has been cold and snowy recently, with dark clouds covering the sky, but this afternoon there is a gradual clearing.

### Okamura Neiji Answers Questions from Reporters: Repeatedly Says "Japan Was Wrong" Regarding the Nanjing Massacre

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 5th] General Okamura Neiji, Commander-in-Chief of the Japanese Expeditionary Force in China before signing the surrender on behalf of Japan in the China Theater, met with one Chinese and one foreign reporter in the morning of the 5th for a long talk, answering various questions asked. Since our country accepted the surrender on 9/9, the name "Okamura" has rarely appeared in the news, because his current status has dropped from a Commander-in-Chief with the rank of general to a General Liaison Officer assigned by our Army Headquarters to implement the surrender of the Japanese army. The General Liaison Department has recently been ordered to downsize, and Okamura met with the visitors in the old Western-style building of the former Japanese Embassy, ​​just moved from the Diplomatic Building. This place, this house, is where Shigeru Kawagoe once sat high and proposed the "Three Principles" to us. Looking at the desolate scenery of the garden in the early winter, with leaves falling one by one, under the illumination of the morning sun, Okamura's already emaciated face appeared even more withered.

At the beginning of the conversation, he first expressed his apologies, saying that meeting with you today as a prisoner is the first time he has received reporters. Then, in answering the first question from the reporter about his impressions of implementing the surrender over the past three months, he expressed deep gratitude for the great spirit of Chairman Chiang and General He. The reporter then asked how many Japanese troops were used in the China Theater during the Sino-Japanese War. Okamura replied that 1.3 million were used, of which about 200,000, at most no more than 300,000, were used to suppress the Communist army. He was also asked about the casualties of the Japanese army, to which he replied that the casualties in each ordinary operation against the Central Army were several thousand, and the casualties in operations against the Communist army were at most two to three thousand each year.

The reporter then questioned him about the theft and sale of equipment and supplies by Japanese soldiers and residents, and the participation of Lieutenant General Sakai of the North China Japanese Army in the Communist Army, and informed him of the "heartbroken" editorial published by the Tokyo Asahi Shimbun on the latter on December 3. Okamura initially admitted to having this information, but ultimately explained his thorough determination to implement the surrender, and he firmly believes that there is absolutely no problem in general, except for a few cases. He also pointed out an example, saying that a certain lieutenant of the Japanese army in Teng County, Shandong Province, was once lured into joining the Communist army, but eventually realized his mistake and returned, and committed seppuku. Okamura also strongly stated that the number of people lured by the Communist army was very small. As for Sakai, Okamura pointed out that he was a retired soldier and had nothing to do with the Japanese military headquarters.

Referring to the Nanjing Massacre of 1937, the reporter asked Okamura to make a comparison with the situation of our army accepting the surrender in Nanjing this time, and to express his personal views from a military standpoint. Okamura first held a cigarette in his mouth and hesitated, then his face turned awkward, and with a wry smile he said, "Of course Japan was wrong, wrong. I am a person with a conscience and cannot bear to mention this matter. Please do not pursue this question." At that time, we were silent for a moment, and then changed the topic.

Impressions of Northeast and North China

When answering the question about his impressions of the Northeast and North China, Okamura praised North China as China's treasure house. The coal production in southern Shanxi and the hydro power of the Yellow River have been carefully investigated by the Japanese, who believe that the future prospects are infinite. He also pointed out that a large lead mine at the south end of the Zhangdian Station on the Jiaoji Railway is the richest in the world. If supplemented by the iron of Jinling and the coal of Boshan, it will make an important contribution to China's future manufacturing industry of airplanes. It is said that during the war, the Japanese had preliminary equipment for mining lead in Zhangdian. If China continues to do so, the hope is great and the future is promising.

### Editorial: Reaffirmation of American Policy

Amidst the change of American envoys to China, international attention is focused on China, especially the evolution of American policy towards China. Indeed, this change of American envoys to China is an extraordinary event. On the one hand, we see Ambassador Hurley, in his resignation statement, pointing out the so-called arbitrariness of career diplomats within the US State Department. On the other hand, we see the appointment of General Marshall, who succeeds Ambassador Hurley, as the US envoy to China. Marshal Marshall was the Chief of Staff of the US Army during the war. The significance of Marshal Marshall accepting the new mandate as a special envoy to China at this juncture does not need our elaboration. At this time, whether the US policy towards China will evolve has become a matter of deep concern to all parties. It is under these circumstances that we feel encouraged after reading the letter from US Secretary of State Byrnes to Congress on the 4th.

Secretary of State Byrnes' letter is a response to a request from California Republican Congressman Anderson, who, in view of the world's attention being focused on the US policy towards China after General Hurley's resignation as Ambassador to China, requested the government to clarify it. The main points of Byrnes' reply are that the United States supports the establishment of a strong, unified, and democratic China, so that it can contribute to peace and stability in the Far East. The United States will use all appropriate methods to pursue policies and actions that are most likely to enable China to achieve domestic unity. According to this policy, the United States believes that China must solve its domestic problems. On the one hand, this task should be solved by China's own efforts. At the same time, the United States will seek appropriate and practical ways to promote China's unity and stability. In order to achieve this goal, and in view of the real situation within China, the United States will assist in the reconstruction of China's chaotic economy and improve the living standards of the Chinese people. The United States will seek to improve China's international status and believes that cooperation between the United States, China, Britain, and the Soviet Union is an essential element for maintaining peace and security in the Far East. This kind of cooperation and the cooperation of other peace-loving countries will be extended to the economic and other fields in fact, based on the principles of equal opportunity and respect for national sovereignty. The United States hopes that the Chinese side, in order to promote this cooperation, will formulate and implement reasonable policies for the arduous task of unification and reconstruction.

Generally speaking, what Secretary of State Byrnes pointed out is a reaffirmation of the traditional US policy in the Far East. Since the time when the powers attempted to divide China, the US policy in the Far East has been to support a China with complete territorial sovereignty. In the economic field, there can be equal value. Based on the "Open Door" policy proposed by John Hay; this is manifested in the Nine-Power Treaty of Washington; this is manifested in the Pacific war during the Second World War. Japan tore up the Nine-Power Treaty and attempted to create the so-called "Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere," which directly conflicted with the US policy, so the Pacific War was unavoidable. Today, with Japan surrendering, the US policy in the Far East is naturally a continuation of its traditional policy in general, which is inevitable.

However, in Secretary of State Byrnes' letter, we see a new direction in the traditional US policy in the Far East, which is to move from safeguarding China's sovereignty and territorial integrity to supporting the establishment of a strong, unified, and democratic China, and to pursue policies and actions in various appropriate ways that are most likely to enable China to achieve domestic unity, and to assist in the reconstruction of China's chaotic economy and improve the living standards of the Chinese people, and to believe that cooperation between the United States, China, Britain, and the Soviet Union is an essential element for maintaining peace and security in the Far East. The fact that the traditional US Far Eastern policy takes these new directions is due to the current reality; this is not an abandonment of the traditional US policy in general, but a continuation of the traditional policy. The Chinese people, after enduring the suffering of eight years of long-term resistance war, are looking forward to the establishment of stability and order, and the improvement of living standards. They are deeply encouraged by the US's kind intention to assist us in nation-building. However, there are a few points here that we would like to offer some opinions on.

First, what the current Chinese National Government is striving for is to establish a strong, unified, and democratic China. Indeed, the current stage of Chinese politics has not yet reached the ideal democratic realm that we desire; this we do not deny, but the goal we are striving for now is to make China's democratization a strong and unified country. The ideals of the Three Principles of the People contain the essence of Western European democratic politics. The politics of the Three Principles of the People can therefore be said to be Western European democratic politics. Today, we see all kinds of people talking about democracy. The word "democracy" is seen as different things by different people. A political ideal based on centralism and collectivism is not the country that the Three Principles of the People wants to establish. We believe that this is not the democratic ideal that our neighboring American people are familiar with. Because in order to disguise their centralism and collectivism, we see so-called "window dressing" everywhere to deceive the world. As for unification, this is especially the focus of the current National Government's efforts. The reality facing China is that a certain armed group is trying to expand its territory, not hesitating to destroy this unification and divide China into two. All of this originally did not need our elaboration, but it seems that we cannot express the intentions of the Chinese people at this time. We do not seem able to.

Second, what we want to particularly emphasize is that, as Secretary of State Byrnes said, the peace and security of the Far East lies in the cooperation of the United States, China, Britain, and the Soviet Union. The enemy that destroyed the peace of the Far East has been defeated. How to maintain the post-war order and security of the Far East depends on the close cooperation of the four great powers of the United States, China, Britain, and the Soviet Union. China not only has no ambition to invade others; in order to maintain the peace and security of the Far East, it has also voluntarily added certain restrictions on the exercise of its own sovereignty. In today's increasingly good situation in the Northeast, we would like to reiterate our idea that we hope that the cooperation of the four powers can also become closer and closer; only in this way can the peace and security of the Far East be ensured.

### Byrnes Sends Letter to Congress Elucidating US Policy Toward China, Military Advisory Group Awaits Marshall's Decision

[United Press International, Washington, 4th] Secretary of State Byrnes today sent a letter to Congress stating that the United States will use various appropriate methods to implement policies and actions that are most likely to enable China to achieve domestic unity. The United States advocates the construction of a strong, unified, and democratic China, so as to contribute to the peace and stability of the Far East. The United States intends to assist China in economic recovery, improve the living standards of its people, and provide China with any assistance it desires. Byrnes also hopes that China can implement its current rational policies. According to those concerned about the future welfare of China, Byrnes' remarks indicate that the United States hopes that China will build its post-war administration, especially those related to commercial interests, which were indeed guaranteed by extraterritoriality in the past. Byrnes also requested close cooperation with the three powers that have the closest relationship with China, saying: "Sincere cooperation between the United States, China, Britain, and the Soviet Union is a necessary condition for maintaining peace and security in the Far East. This cooperation should also be extended to the economic field so that all countries can obtain equal opportunities in China."

[Central News Agency, Washington, 4th Dispatch] Marshal Marshall must testify on the Pearl Harbor incident on the 6th, so the date of his arrival in China has been delayed. It is still remembered that Truman told reporters on the 28th of last month that he expected Marshal Marshall to leave in three or four days, and that his policy instructions to Marshal Marshall would be published publicly, but there has been no indication so far. On the 4th, Sales, Chief of the Intelligence Department of the Army Department, told reporters that because of the sudden time crunch and the need to attend and testify on the Pearl Harbor incident, Marshal Marshall would not be able to hold a press conference or accept interviews before leaving for China. If he has anything to say to the Chinese people, he will publish it after arriving in China.

[Central News Agency, this city dispatch] There are various rumors about the organization of the Military Advisory Group to China. The reporter specially interviewed relevant parties and American officers who have been ordered to stay in China to inquire about everything. It is said that the formal establishment of the Military Advisory Group to China must wait until General Marshall arrives in China before a decision can be made. At present, most of the officers and soldiers in various departments who do not need to stay in China have been ordered to return home one after another, and General Middleton of the US Military Sending Command is responsible for presiding over them. The remaining officers and soldiers are staying here waiting for orders. Most of those working in China are regular soldiers of the United States, mostly in Shanghai, and there are also a small number of personnel in Chongqing, among whom there are talents from various departments, with a number of at least more than three thousand people.

[United Press International, Tianjin, 5th] The reporter visited Rear Admiral Lockard, commander of the US Third Amphibious Force, today and asked when the US troops in North China would withdraw. The answer was: "Your guess is just like my guess." The majority of the US troops here believe that they will stay until the second half of next year. A month ago, it was widely rumored in Tianjin that most of the US troops would withdraw today, but so far only 5,000 of the 60,000 people have returned home. President Truman's appointment of General Marshall as special envoy to China seems to be to order him to thoroughly study the situation in China and submit a report to him. When the US troops will return home will depend on General Marshall's report. The US military currently has 30 days of food in stock, and 120 days of supplies are currently en route, which shows that they will stay here for a long time.

### Declaration of the British Labour Government Wishes India to Gain Self-Government Soon Resolves to Dispatch Delegation to Visit Indian Leaders

[Reuters, London, 5th] Secretary of State for India Lawrence declared in the Upper House yesterday: A delegation of the British Parliament, under the auspices of the Imperial Parliamentary Association, will go to India as soon as possible to meet with local political leaders and listen to their opinions. The British government believes that it is extremely urgent to establish a constitutional institution in India so that the Indian people can decide their future by themselves. After the parliamentary delegation goes to India, it can also inform the Indian people of the British people's deep hope that India will gain its legitimate status as an independent country within the British Commonwealth, and the determination of the British Parliament to do its best to help India achieve this goal as soon as possible. The selection of the delegation will be determined after the Parliamentary Association seeks the opinions of the leaders of various parties. The Earl also said that the transition period must be a difficult period, so the Indian government and local governments in various provinces should assume the responsibility of maintaining law and order, and should especially prevent any attempt to interfere with the constitutional government by force. The complete self-government aspiration must be gradually transferred to the Indian Standing Bureau through peaceful and orderly methods before the establishment of a self-governing government can be realized.

### Delaying Tactics The Purpose Is No Different From Before

Since the British government announced that it would send a special parliamentary delegation to visit India, our reporter specially visited various relevant figures to listen to the opinions of all parties. Menon, Secretary of the Indian League, said that this is a delaying tactic, and the purpose is no different from before. Stanley, the former Colonial Secretary and current Chairman of the Conservative Party's India Committee, believes that the government's mention of the maintenance of law and order at this time is quite timely, but the status of the delegation needs to be determined. Searle, Chairman of the Indian Parliamentary Committee, believes that this move shows the responsibility of the Labour government. Akbar Gan, Chairman of the London Indian Workers Association, said that sending a delegation is of little significance. We only need concrete proposals for Indian independence.

### The British Parliamentary Investigation Team Has a Special Task

After Privy Councilor Morrison made a declaration similar to that of Secretary of State for India Lawrence in the Lower House, various parties in the Lower House asked questions one after another. Eden spoke first. Before the Conservative Party criticized Morrison's declaration, it must first understand what task the parliamentary delegation will undertake. Foreign Secretary should know that this kind of delegation has also been sent to self-governing territories and colonies several times in the past, but my intention is that these delegations are all completely informal. Is the delegation sent this time similar to the previous ones? I think it must be. Or is it different from previous delegations? If so, what are the differences? Does the current delegation need to make a report? If so, to whom should it submit the report? All of these points should be clarified so as to avoid any misunderstandings in India about the task of the delegation. Eden continued: He fully agreed with the Privy Councilor's statement that the development of Indian self-government can never be based on force or threats. Morrison replied: This is a delegation hosted by the Imperial Parliamentary Association, and I mean it contains specialness. One of its purposes is to convey the goodwill of the British Parliament and make various contacts. He hopes that when the delegation returns in the future, it will have the opportunity to consult with the government so as to express its opinions and consider the actions that should be taken in India in the future. What he meant by slightly containing specialness refers to this. Subsequently, Conservative Party member Smith said: Previous delegations to India have never visited Assam and Bengal in the northeastern corner of India. Can they go there this time to make contact with Muslim leaders? Morrison replied: The itinerary of this delegation will not reach so far. The point that Mike mentioned should be kept in mind. Then Labour Party member Walter asked: If the ultimate goal of the Indian people is to be unwilling to always be a part of the British Commonwealth, and they must be allowed to make their own decisions, then can your minister clearly explain here that the status of self-governing territories can no longer be mentioned in relation to India? Morrison replied: There is no need to have any doubts about this point. He also said: The British government is now adhering to the position it announced earlier, but of course we hope that India will still be in the British Commonwealth with free will.

### Indonesian Welcomes UN Mediation

Prime Minister Shari Tells Reporters

[Central News Agency, Batavia, 4th] Indonesian Prime Minister Shari told reporters yesterday: Indonesia welcomes direct mediation activities by the United Nations and deeply hopes that our problems will be accepted and considered by the United Nations. Shari clearly stated that negotiations with the Netherlands are necessary for a peaceful solution, but the Indonesian government still adheres to the "unchanging" policy of not accepting any recognition of Indonesia's independence. We do not accept the political rule of the Dutch, but only want to accept their economic cooperation. Shari continued: If the Netherlands attempts to regain its rule by force, we will have other choices.

### Hurley Accuses America's Policy

On the Colonial System in Southeast Asia Policy and Actions Contradict Each Other

[Central News Agency, New York, 3rd Dispatch] Hurley once accused American supplies of being used to support imperialism in Asian colonies, and recent news from Vietnam and Indonesia has aroused questions about the US's position and policy on the British, French, and Dutch colonies in Southeast Asia. What the US policy on colonial issues shows is actually contradictory, as it still uses Lend-Lease equipment to supply Britain, France, and the Netherlands, enabling the three countries to use it to crush the national movements of the colonial people, while at the same time implying opposition to the actions of Britain, France, and the Netherlands in Asia. One reason why the United States adopts this ambiguous position is that Southeast Asia was previously designated as the scope of British military operations. Therefore, although the US government has repeatedly reaffirmed its confidence in the principle of self-determination, it is unwilling to make any statement or act on the colonial people's hopes for independence. General Hurley therefore pointed out that the US policy is to restore the full colonies of various countries.

### US Congressmen Pay Attention to the Situation in Korea Kim Gu Wins Support from All Parties

[United Press International, Washington, 4th] Informed sources observed: In view of the congressional investigation into General Hurley's attack, it may go beyond China and expand into a general review of US Far Eastern policy. The Korean issue has attracted considerable attention, and Congress may ask the State Department to disclose to what extent progress has been made in eliminating the dividing line between Korea. Several US congressmen told United Press International that they could not understand why this dividing line still exists after the work of Japanese surrender in Korea has been completed. The State Department is unwilling to comment on the situation in Korea, but is quite satisfied with the political development of the country after liberation.

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 5th Dispatch] A super party will be established in southern Korea. If this super party is established, it will be the most powerful party in Korean politics. Seventeen parties with lighter political colors have already merged and decided to support Kim Gu. The leaders of the Democratic Party and the National Party have repeatedly stated that they support Kim Gu, and this newly merged party will also give Kim Gu the broadest political power. Since returning from Chongqing, Kim Gu has shown the talent of an outstanding statesman, and he still maintains an attitude beyond all parties.

### Britain Makes Six New Demands on Siam

[Central News Agency, Bangkok, 4th, United Press] Among the new demands made by Britain on Siam are the right to represent Siam in negotiations with France on territorial treaties in India. The first new clause is that Siam will continue to be ruled by Britain before being accepted as a member of the United Nations. Second, Britain has the right to control all Siamese banks, enterprises, foreign exchange, and commercial transactions. Third, rice, tea, and rubber are temporarily prohibited from being exported. Fourth, before the global food shortage is resolved, Siam must hand over all surplus rice to Britain. Fifth, newspapers, radio stations, telephones, and telegrams must be subject to British inspection. Sixth, Siam should be subject to the restraints of all treaties signed by Britain and other countries before December 7, 1941, regardless of whether it is a party to the treaties. There are other demands that are extremely strong. Some members of the Siamese government have stated that if the new Anglo-Siamese treaty is signed, they will resign.

### US Loan of Forty Billion to Britain Final Agreement Can Be Negotiated US Will Convene International Trade Conference Next Year Whether Britain Will Sign the Bretton Woods Agreement Remains to Be Decided

[Reuters, Washington, 5th] A US loan of 4.4 billion to Britain is in sight, and a final agreement may be negotiated in just 24 to 30 hours. The top economic minds of Britain and the United States are working hard to restore Britain, which has been impoverished by the war. Negotiators from both sides have worked hard to negotiate various financial details over the past three months, and there have often been considerable differences of opinion, but at the current stage of negotiations, an agreement is almost within reach. It is said that the final agreement has been reached on the amount of the loan. The interest rate is 2%, and the amortization will begin in five years, and will be paid off in 50 years. Among them, 3.75 billion US dollars is newly allocated, and the remaining 650 million US dollars will be used to clear Lend-Lease goods. According to London political observers: If the Anglo-American financial negotiations can have satisfactory results, the United States may convene an international trade conference in February next year. In addition to the United Nations, neutral countries such as Sweden, Switzerland, and Denmark will also be invited. The British Empire will hold an Imperial Trade Conference in London in January next year before the International Trade Conference is held.

[United Press International, Washington, 5th] The Bretton Woods Monetary Agreement will expire on the 31st of this month. Britain is currently the key to the overall situation. If Britain signs it, other countries will almost certainly follow suit. Then the agreement stipulates that the establishment of two major international financial institutions, namely the Monetary Fund Committee and the World Bank, will be established. If Britain does not sign it, the plan may not be implemented. The Export-Import Bank has lent France 55 billion francs in order to continue purchasing necessary goods after the termination of the Lend-Lease Act, repayable in 32 years, with an interest rate of 2.83%.

### Scrub Typhus Serum Therapy Adopted

This serum is extracted from rabbits that have been injected with the scrub typhus virus. It has been tested on mice and has been quite effective, but whether it can be tested on the human body.

### Mandarin Education in Taiwan Province

— Zhang Yiqu

In the newly reborn Taiwan Province, Mandarin education is more important and urgent than any other issue!

However, past achievements tell us that promoting Mandarin is not something that can be achieved in a short period. In 1913, the Ministry of Education held the "Conference on the Unification of Pronunciation," which established the "Zhuyin Alphabet." In April 1930, the "Zhuyin Alphabet" was renamed "Zhuyin Symbols," and schools throughout the country were ordered to implement it. More than thirty years have passed since then, but has there been any significant progress? To be honest, 99% of people still speak local dialects mixed with a transformed version of Mandarin. The reason is that China has a vast territory and complex languages. Not to mention the Sino-Tibetan, Tai-Kadai, Hmong-Mien, Tibeto-Burman, Tungusic, Mongolian, and Turkic language families, which are completely different languages, even within the Sino-Tibetan language family, there are differences between the Mandarin spoken in the north and upper/lower Yangtze River regions, and the dialects of Wu, Anhui, Min, and Yue. The Chinese people are bound by the habit of "being content with their native soil," with a stronger sense of localism than nationalism. It is naturally difficult to completely reform these complex, localized languages in a short period.

However, Taiwan Province cannot be compared to the rest of China. The Taiwanese people have been oppressed by the Japanese for too long. Their writing in Japanese and speaking Japanese were acts of necessity. Now that they have returned to the embrace of their motherland, their sense of national identity has been awakened. Are they still willing to humbly write enemy Japanese characters and speak enemy Japanese?

I remember in August 1935, when I was in Singapore, Kuala Lumpur, Batavia, and other regions to study education for overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia. Most of the overseas Chinese there were from Fujian and Guangdong, where Min and Yue dialects prevailed. However, the performance of Mandarin language in overseas Chinese schools was very impressive. Whether it was elementary, middle, or highschool they could speak fluent Mandarin with no hint of the local dialect. The reason is very simple: they have traveled across oceans and have long been separated from their homeland. They need to maintain their national culture anytime and anywhere. Therefore, their national consciousness is stronger than their sense of localism. As a result, they easily accept the promotion of Mandarin by the motherland with enthusiasm. Similarly, the Taiwanese people, who have been oppressed by the Japanese for 51 years, must be more in need of the protection of the motherland's culture, and they will definitely practice Mandarin eagerly, like a thirsty person thinking of drink and a hungry person thinking of food.

Another point is that Mandarin and dialects share some similarities, making it difficult to completely transform them. A foreign music teacher fears that students who have practiced music elsewhere will have inaccurate pronunciations and that correction will take time, so he charges double tuition. The same principle applies here. Teaching Mandarin to the Taiwanese people starts completely from scratch, which is not only easier to practice than in the "one person teaches, everyone makes noise" environment in mainland China, but is also easier to impart than to overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia who already have Min and Yue dialects as a foundation.

As long as the education authorities of Taiwan Province make a serious effort, Mandarin education in Taiwan Province can definitely achieve great results in a short period.

### Chen Xing Discusses New Foreign Exchange Rate; Announcement Possible Within Days; Provisional Measures for Foreign Trade to be Drafted; Foreign Banks to Resume Operations First, Then Register

[Special Interview by Our Newspaper] Our reporter paid a special visit yesterday to Chen Xing, the Special Commissioner of Finance and Banking for the Shanghai-Nanjing-Zhejiang area, to inquire about the issue of revising the foreign exchange rate, which has been of great concern to all sectors of the city recently. According to Chen, "Major economic and financial issues in this city, such as balancing prices, restoring foreign trade, and enhancing production, all hinge on the foreign exchange rate. Because this matter is related to the livelihood and commerce of Shanghai citizens, I have telegraphed the Ministry of Finance several times, urging them to make a decision on the new foreign exchange rate as soon as possible."

Foreign Exchange Rate

"Although I have not received formal instructions on this matter, concrete measures may be announced in the coming days. To enable exporters in this city to resume foreign trade as soon as possible, provisional measures have been drafted, requiring exporters to deposit their foreign exchange at the Bank of China. The central bank will then send personnel to review whether the deposit amount is equivalent to the price of the exported goods, and then issue a certificate, which the customs office will use to inspect and release the exported goods."

Foreign Banks

Chen also stated: "Regarding the resumption of operations of foreign banks in this city, the Ministry of Finance has drafted measures to allow foreign banks to resume business in advance and then complete the registration procedures. According to Chen, the registration process is very simple. Foreign banks operating in Chongqing, such as HSBC and Mercantile Bank, have already registered in accordance with the law. Foreign banks in this city are preparing to resume operations. Once the foreign exchange issue is concretely resolved, foreign banks will resume operations one after another." Also, the financial community in this city has various rumors about the foreign exchange rate. According to sources, a suitable exchange rate will be established at the meeting of the Supreme Economic Council.

### 30th Anniversary of the Zhaohe Uprising - Seamen's Organizations Hold Commemorative Meeting - Telegram to Chairman Respectfully and Requesting to Stop Internal Strife

The Special Seamen's Party Department of the Chinese Kuomintang, the Chinese Seamen's Union, and various Shanghai seamen's organizations held a commemorative meeting for the 30th anniversary of the Zhaohe Uprising at Lake Society on Beijing Road at 10:00 a.m. yesterday, and celebrated the first Seamen's Day. More than 2,000 people, including Qian Dajun, Pan Gongzhan, Yang Hu, Li Jilan, Wang Xiaolai, Zhao Zukang, Feng Zhongda, Wu Xiu, Shen Zhongyi, and seamen's representatives, gathered together, making it a grand occasion.

Yang Hu's Speech

Chairman Yang Hu first delivered a speech, saying that the "Zhaohe Uprising" took place in the fourth year of the Republic of China. The central government specifically designated this memorial day as Seamen's Memorial Day, which has great significance. The person in charge of the Zhaohe Uprising was Mr. Chen Ying Shi, so we specifically held this commemoration at Lake Society. In addition to Mr. Chen, the leader was Chairman Chiang. We must continue to work hard and struggle under the leadership of Chairman Chiang. The Seamen's Party Department, the Seamen's Union, and Zhaohe Middle School all have historical origins and can also be said to have been developed and grown under my leadership. I hope we will work harder and promote the spirit of our Chinese seamen.

Mayor Qian's Speech

Mayor Qian then delivered a speech, saying that the Prime Minister led the revolution, and although he suffered many setbacks, he always worked tirelessly and never lost heart. The heroic sacrifice of the seventy-two martyrs of the Huanghuagang Uprising led to the success of the Xinhai Revolution, and the martyrdom of the gentlemen of the Zhaohe Uprising led to the glorious feat of the "Yunnan Uprising." I think the Zhaohe Uprising has the same great significance as the Huanghuagang Uprising. Now that the War of Resistance has been won, not only are there still many obstacles to the great cause of national construction, but we must continue to work hard with the spirit of revolution to achieve the goal of national construction. Our Chinese seamen have made great contributions in history. From today's celebration of the first Seamen's Day, let us unite under the leadership of Special Commissioner Yang and work hard for the Party and the country.

Standing Committee Member Pan's Speech

Central Standing Committee member Pan Gongchen then delivered a speech, saying: Thirty years ago today, the Zhaohe soldiers uprising led by Mr. Chen Ying Shi and Chairman Chiang, although it failed, failure is the mother of success. The Zhaohe Uprising had a great impact on the Yunnan Uprising twenty days later, and awakened the revolutionary comrades throughout the country. Seamen should know that our country has a very long coastline, and shipping is very important. Seamen have glorious achievements in history, and they will have a future in the development of the ocean. Seamen comrades should encourage the younger generation to go to the sea.

Temporary Motions

Finally, the meeting passed two temporary motions: (1) The meeting sent a telegram to Chairman Chiang to pay respects; (2) The Communist army is making trouble, please ask the government to quickly stop the chaos and maintain the people's livelihood. At the end, everyone shouted slogans and dispersed in the melodious military music.

### Mei Lanfang's Performance - Fame Unabated from Years Past

Dr. Mei Lanfang's recent performances at the Majestic Theater have been very wonderful for consecutive days. Such as "Stabbing the Tiger," "Broken Bridge," "Startled Dream," etc., with Yu Zhenfei, Zhu Chuanming, Jiang Miaoxiang and other roles as supporting actors, the peony and green leaves add to the beauty. Among them, the "Qi Shuang Hui (Selling Horses)" last night was even more of a unique masterpiece. Mei Lanfang's Gui Zhi, Yu Zhenfei's Zhao Chong. The pairing is neat and breathtaking. Mei's performance is pure fire, conveying the psychology and identity of the characters in the play in every detail, which is fascinating. The writing section is especially delicate and appropriate, depicting the mood and behavior of young women in a way that is seamless and perfect. In this classic old drama, his artistic performance has reached the ultimate in perfection. Mei's singing is round and moist, with a wide and sweet voice, and the beauty of the rhyme and the realism of the performance can be said to be two difficult things combined. As for Jiang Miaoxiang's Bao Tong and Li Baokui's Li Qi, they can also be called competent, and it is not an exaggeration to say that they are icing on the cake. It is also learned that Mei will perform "Si Fan" and "Broken Bridge" tonight at the request of all walks of life. He will rest as soon as the ten-day performance is over.

### National Law Does Not Tolerate Traitors - Chen Riping Under Interrogation - Met Dague Mao and Served as a Puppet Legislator

[Special Dispatch from This Newspaper] Chen Riping has been detained at the Masnan Road Detention Center since his arrest on September 6. The inspection has now been completed. Yesterday afternoon at 2:00 p.m., the Second Criminal Court of the Higher Second Branch Court opened an investigation court. Chen Riping was wearing a beige camel down robe and looked haggard. He was interrogated by Judge Zhu Zonghai. The questions and answers were as follows:

Q: "How old are you and where are you from?"

A: "Fifty-nine years old, from Guangdong!"

"What school did you attend?"

"Graduated from Waseda University in Japan."

"What kind of puppet positions did you hold?"

A: "I returned to China in the thirteenth year of the Republic of China to practice as a certified public accountant. After the fall of Shanghai, I lived in Hongkou and met a Japanese man named Dague Mao. (According to Dague Mao, he was a translator under Kawahara Eikichi, who had special agent relations.) He often persuaded me to do something for "Sino-Japanese friendship." I was perfunctory at the time. Later, the tabloids published that I was a "Legislative Member." The environment at the time made it impossible to refuse, so it became true."

Q: "What did you do as the Director of the Economic Department of the First District of Puppet Shanghai?"

A: "Only two things: (1) Suppressing and leveling prices, (2) Allocating materials. I absolutely did not collect any contributions from the people."

Q: "The Reorganized National Government gave you a medal. You must have made contributions."

A: "I don't know myself. They probably meant it as a memorial to me after I left Nanjing."

Q: "What did you do as the deputy editor of the newspaper controlled by the enemy? Did you promote the enemy?"

A: "No, I know I'm sorry to the country and the people, so I work hard in social welfare to reduce my sins."

Q: "How much property do you have?"

A: "Because my income is limited, I have not accumulated any property."

Q: "Is the land in Jiangwan Two your own? Why is it in your children's names?"

A: "Because the real estate is for my children's education expenses, so it is in my children's names."

Q: "The enemy gained a lot of strength with the help of you traitors. Do you know that you are resisting the country and harming the people?"

A: "I have never resisted the country. I was wrong in not being firm in my will the first time. I was afraid of danger and did a little work with the enemy."

The judge also summoned Chen Riping's daughter, Chen Yizhen, 25 years old, currently living at 528 North Sichuan Road.

The judge asked: "Your father is planting traitors. Do you know what he is doing?"

A: "I used to study at McTyeire School for Girls and only went home once every two weeks, so I don't know much."

Q: "How much property does your father have?"

A: "There are two pieces of land in Jiangwan. The regular day gold is 11,000 yuan paid in installments. Now one piece has been designated as a farm."

Chen Zeng Zhijing, the wife of Chen Riping, also from Guangdong, 46 years old, with gray hair and a short stature, was also summoned.

The judge asked: "You also studied in Japan, right?"

A: "No, my father was an overseas Chinese businessman in Japan."

Q: "Is your husband a traitor because you are familiar with Japan? Does it have anything to do with you?"

A: "After the August 13th Incident, I returned to Guangdong with my daughter to visit relatives. I don't know anything about my husband's situation in Shanghai."

Q: "Do you have a son?"

A: "Yes, he is studying medicine in Japan and cannot come back now."

At about 3:00 p.m., the court adjourned and the hearing was rescheduled for the 7th. Chen Riping was transferred to the detention branch of the District Court.

### Social Services – Maintaining Order at Tram Stops

— Guojie

Passengers Abide by the Principle of Queuing

I am a small government employee and a frequent passenger on the British tramway. Every morning, when boarding at the Jing'an Temple stop, I see tram company ticket inspectors guiding the queue, maintaining order, and often policemen or police officers supervising. Therefore, although the queue is long, the order is well-maintained, and there is no phenomenon of scrambling. However, the situation is very different in the evenings when returning from the Bund or Henan Road stops. At the alighting platform on the Bund, a large number of passengers gather, and as soon as the tram is empty, they bravely climb aboard and occupy seats. On the boarding side, another group of strong individuals throws the long, orderly queue behind them and rushes forward, so that passengers who queue up have fewer opportunities to board. In particular, some armed comrades take the lead in boarding. Naturally, they disdain queuing, and it is necessary to correct this. According to my observation, most passengers are still willing to queue, but they are disrupted by a few individuals and have to protect themselves. If the few disruptive elements can be brought back to order, it would not be difficult to establish order. Although we do not wish to be controlled, control is necessary for those with low intelligence and poor morals to ensure they strictly abide by the rules. Therefore, if the tram company and the police bureau could emulate the methods of the Jing'an Temple stop and rectify the other stops, extending from the second route tram to other routes, and from British trams to French trams, we ordinary law-abiding citizens would greatly benefit. I wonder what the editor thinks? I hope you will publish this to draw the attention of the municipal authorities.

(Note) The difficulty of traffic in the city during the morning and evening rush hours is indeed a fact. I published "Solving the Problem of Transportation" in this column on the 29th of last month, proposing ways to improve the situation, but unfortunately, they have not been implemented. The above-mentioned dispatch of personnel by the tram company and the police bureau to guide queuing is also a good solution in the absence of other options. I hope the above two agencies can adopt and implement it earnestly. — Editor

Seeking Zhou Guoneng – To Whom It May Concern: My relative, Zhou Guoneng, also known as Ke Duo, is 19 years old and originally from Yin County, Zhejiang Province. He used to work at Jin Feng Hardware Store in Tai'an Lane, North Suzhou Road, Shanghai (now located on Beijing Road). After being dismissed from the store in June last year, he did not return home, and there has been no news of him since. His 80-year-old mother is alone at home, anxious day and night, and cries incessantly. After searching everywhere, some say that he was lured by the enemy and puppets to work as a laborer. At that time, under the oppression of the enemy and puppets, there was no way to inquire. Now, fortunately, the War of Resistance has been won, and it is said that some laborers have been transported back to the country. I dare to ask your newspaper to trouble yourself and inquire whether there is such a person among the laborers transported back? If it is revealed, so that I can know if he wants to go home or has any whereabouts, please let me know, so that mother and son can meet. Then, my gratitude will be boundless. This is addressed to the Shen Bao newspaper, from Li Yugong. (Mailing address: No. 27, Lane 142, Nantong Road, Shanghai)

### Letters to the Editor

Answering Questions Regarding the Regulations on the Management of Housing Rentals

To the editor, regarding the four points of discussion on the doubts of Zi Jun on the Regulations on the Management of Housing Rentals in your column on the 4th of this month, the answers are as follows: (1) This committee formulated these regulations based on Article 23 of the Wartime Housing Rental Regulations, which were amended and approved by four committee meetings and the 88th and 89th municipal meetings, including sub-lessees. (2) Article 2 of these regulations does not affect the rights and obligations of rental relations under the Civil Code. Before the Wartime Housing Rental Regulations are repealed, the provisions of those regulations and these regulations shall apply. (3) In Article 11, Paragraph 5 of these regulations, the word "未" (not) in the original text "承租人「未」為改良裝置……" (the tenant "has not" made improvements...) was mistakenly printed as "專" (exclusive), causing confusion. (4) The provisions of the same paragraph above are intended to limit the statutory profits between tenants and sub-lessees. This is a reply to the Social Services column of the Shen Bao from the Shanghai Municipal Housing Rental Management Committee.

### Nanjing West Road – Widening for an Expressway

[Special Report from This Newspaper] The municipal government has now decided to widen the section of Jing'an Temple Road (i.e., Nanjing West Road) along the Racecourse to facilitate traffic. The plan has already been drafted by the Public Works Bureau and will be started in a short period of time. It is reported that the section to be widened is from Ma Huo Road to New World, using the open space of the Racecourse to widen it by several feet to the south. Since the liberation of Shanghai, vehicles have become increasingly crowded. In order to maintain the main traffic lines, the authorities have designated Nanjing Road and the eastern section of Jing'an Temple Road as expressways, prohibiting the use of rickshaws, tricycles, and bicycles. Now, in order to improve traffic, it has been decided to widen the road so that all types of vehicles can pass without hindrance. This plan is the first sign of the city's construction work. The budget for this project is estimated to be over 30 million yuan.

### Nehru – A Family of Loyal Martyrs

— Yu Fan

### Nehru and His Sister

"Imprisonment in today's turbulent world is no longer a significant matter. For me, imprisonment has long become routine. I believe imprisonment has its own value and is beneficial to a person."

Nehru, who said these words, is 55 years old this year, and he has spent almost half his life in British prisons. He and Gandhi are both leaders of the Indian independence movement, but his style is more radical, so the taste of prison has become his daily fare. Especially commendable is that his whole family fought for the independence movement. His father, mother, wife, two sisters, and his brother-in-law have all been imprisoned. Recently, his sister Krishna's autobiography, "With No Regrets," was published in the United States. This book chronicles the history of the struggle of this family of loyal martyrs.

Nehru's father, Motilal, was originally one of the richest men in India. His residence and diet were extremely luxurious. Nehru and his siblings grew up in a luxurious environment. His two sisters were taught by English teachers at home, and he went to Cambridge University in England at the age of 18. He returned to China in 1912 and began to participate in the national independence movement.

Old Nehru was a keen and fiery man. He either did not do anything, or he did not stop until he succeeded. At first, he did not agree with Gandhi's non-cooperation movement. In 1919, British soldiers in Boge forbade Indians to gather and hold meetings, and fired shots, killing and wounding thousands of Indians. This massacre aroused public outrage and completely changed Old Nehru's heart.

When he decided to do it, he mobilized all his strength to do it. He gave up his legal profession, gave up his luxurious life, donated all his family property, and invested all the financial and human resources of his family under Gandhi's banner. Krishna said in her book: "This is the beginning of a new life - a dangerous, difficult, and arduous new life... From then on, going to prison and coming out of prison became an unchangeable habit for our family."

In 1925, Nehru and his wife and sister went to Switzerland for treatment, and participated in many international peace conferences. These were the most comfortable days of their lives. Later, the whole family traveled to the Soviet Union to see the celebration of the tenth anniversary of the Soviet revolution. The impression of Shanghai at one time certainly increased their revolutionary determination. And what they found most interesting was that the prisons in the Soviet Union were really very clean and very much to their liking.

Old Nehru suffered from overwork and illness. In 1931, he was released from prison due to illness and died soon after. His funeral was grand and magnificent, and the will and strength of all free people in India were fully expressed in it. Gandhi's eulogy said: "Motilal's death is an irreplaceable loss to me."

Nehru inherited his father's will and continued to work hard. He and Gandhi were arrested and imprisoned at the same time in 1932, but his two sisters and his elderly mother continued to fight against the imperialists. Then, the sisters were immediately detained in prison, followed by the old lady. Krishna said that life in prison was "uncomfortable," but it was still "a magnificent and extraordinary experience."

"With No Regrets" is a gentle and lovely book, without propaganda or serious Indian political issues. "British imperialists will not be in danger of stroke after reading it." But in moderation, readers can easily see how this family of loyal martyrs put their ideals into action and how they promoted a sacred integrity after Gandhi.

### "Black Prince"

— Jin Dezhang

There are many ships that have participated in the Atlantic naval battle, the Indian Ocean naval battle, and the Pacific naval battle, traveling from west to east and almost circling the globe, but the "Black Prince" is the first warship with this glorious record to come to China.

We can get a glimpse of its heroic feats just by looking at the records on the warship's steel armor. In 1944, it sank two German destroyers in the North Sea, participated in the chase of German and Italian naval forces in the Mediterranean Sea, sank five merchant ships in the German convoy, transported reinforcements to Athens in the Aegean Sea, and exerted its full strength in the Normandy landing, firing a total of 1,250 shells, fighting for ten full days, using up all the shells, and completing the cover for the Allied landing. In 1945, it bombarded the Japanese army in Sumatra and was active near the coast of Japan.

The "Black Prince" is a 7,000-ton cruiser in the British Navy. It does not have special power, with only eight 5.25-inch main guns, some one-pound and two-pound secondary guns, six torpedoes, and a sailing speed of 30 nautical miles per hour. It was born in 1942, but officially entered service on December 21, 1943, the British Navy Day.

In addition to these weapons, which are not enough to threaten the enemy, the "Black Prince" was able to build its glorious record due to the bravery and alertness of all the crew members and the proper command of Captain Gladstone.

Chinese people feel even more gratified and proud because there are also the blood and sweat of Chinese people on such a warship with glorious achievements. Although Chinese people account for only a dozen of the more than 600 crew members, the contribution of Chinese people to the World War cannot be ignored.

The "Black Prince" has more than 620 crew members, of which 20 are Chinese. Some of the 20 are employed in the engine room, and some are chefs. There is also one officer, Lieutenant Wang Xianqiong.

Lieutenant Wang is from Hubei Province. He graduated from Qingdao Naval Academy at a young age. After graduation, he rose to the rank of second mate of the warship Tongxin. In 1943, he was sent by the authorities to the British Navy for internship. In 1944, he accepted the appointment of the British naval authorities and was sent to the 35,000-ton battleship Wars Pite as a gunner. On the Wars Pite, Lieutenant Wang participated in the opening of the second battlefield, the naval battle in the Mediterranean Sea. In June of this year, he was transferred to the "Black Prince" to serve, working in the navigation department, which enabled him to fulfill the Chinese people's long-cherished wish: to eliminate the enemy and strive for world peace.

The "Black Prince" arrived in Shanghai on the 21st of last month from the Chinese South China Sea base. It is currently under the Eastern Fleet of the British Navy. This visit to Shanghai is to give the crew a vacation, and to give Lieutenant Wang and other Chinese sailors a vacation to see their motherland after a few years of separation, and also to let the Chinese people see the naval achievements that our new Chinese naval personnel have established overseas for the Allied nations!

### The Enemy (13)

— Pearl S. Buck, translated by Zhu Qi

He asked the messenger, "What is it?" Then he saw the uniform and stood up.

The man said, "Please come to the palace once. The old general's illness has relapsed."

Hana exhaled and said, "Oh, is that all?"

The messenger was surprised and said, "Is that all! Isn't that enough?"

She replied, "Enough, enough, I'm sorry."

When Sadao went to the palace, she sat in the kitchen, but didn't do anything. The children were already asleep. She was just sitting there to rest for a while. Work had not made her tired, but fear had exhausted her.

She said, "I thought they were coming to arrest you."

Looking at her anxious eyes, he said painfully, "For your sake, I must get rid of this man. I must find a way to get rid of him."

The general said weakly, "Of course, I fully understand. But this is because I received a degree from Princeton in the United States. Very few Japanese have studied in the United States."

Sadao said, "I am not at all concerned about that person, sir, but since I have performed such a successful operation on him..."

The general said, "Yes, yes. This makes me feel even more that I must have you. You can obviously save anyone—your skills are so superb. If you say you want to have another attack like today, can I stand it?"

Sadao said, "Not more than once."

The general said anxiously, "Then, of course, I won't allow you to have any accidents." His long, pale Japanese-style face became expressionless, which meant that he was thinking deeply. The general closed his eyes and said, "You cannot be arrested. If you are sentenced to death, and I need surgery the next day, what then?"

Sadao suggested, "There are other surgeons, sir."
