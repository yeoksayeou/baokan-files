### Sino-Soviet Negotiations to Reach Agreement; National Army to Soon be Airlifted to Changchun

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 30th] Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek met with Lieutenant General Liang Huasheng, Deputy Commander of the Security of the Nine Northeastern Provinces, at 4 PM on the 28th. He expressed his appreciation for Liang's achievements in training cadres and technical personnel of all levels in Yunnan Province over the years, and gave detailed instructions regarding his new mission in the Northeast. Liang is scheduled to leave Chongqing on the 30th and fly to Hankou via Xunyang to handle the affairs of the Military Affairs Commission Training Group before heading north.

[United Press, Chongqing, 30th] Reports indicate that the Sino-Soviet negotiations have resulted in a temporary decision on the issue of the National Army's entry into the Northeast, and a final response from Moscow is currently awaited. If this response is satisfactory, the National Army can immediately enter Shenyang. Furthermore, according to news from North China, senior Chinese railway officials in Changchun have been flying from Beiping to Changchun for several days. As for personnel to take over factories, mines, and other industries in the Northeast, they are still staying inside the customs.

[Associated Press, Chongqing, 30th] Local newspapers report that the Sino-Soviet negotiations have seen improvement, and the National Army can smoothly enter the Northeast by both sea and air. Air Force personnel are currently waiting for planes in Beiping and Tianjin to fly to the Northeast and set up airfields in Changchun and Shenyang. It is rumored that final deployments will be made within a week, at which point the National Army's airlift can begin. Regarding the Chinese personnel working for the Sino-Soviet joint management of the Changchun Railway, they arrived in Changchun in two batches from Beiping on the 27th and 28th. The National Government is preparing to take over administrative organs first, and will begin taking over factories once the Sino-Soviet negotiations reach fruition.

[Associated Press, Chongqing, 30th] All sectors of the public in this area are deeply satisfied with a TASS news item originating from Changchun. The news stated that Malinovsky had agreed to a "temporary postponement" of the Soviet Army's withdrawal from the Northeast. It also stated that the reason the Soviet side refused Chinese troops to land at Dalian was because Dalian "is a commercial port, specializing in transporting goods, not troops." TASS also stated that the Chinese military headquarters planned to airlift troops to Changchun and Shenyang. It is expected that Chinese ground personnel will soon arrive at Changchun Airport to await the landing of aircraft carrying the airlifted troops. In addition, the Soviet news agency clarified that the Chinese government had requested the Soviet Army to postpone its withdrawal from the Northeast because the Chinese government could not deploy troops to the Northeast before the original withdrawal date of December 3rd, and therefore could not organize administrative organs in that area. How long the Soviet Army will remain stationed in the Northeast depends on further negotiations between Chinese government officials and Malinovsky in Changchun.

### National Army Continues Northward Advance; Northeast Security Headquarters Moved to Jinzhou

[This Newspaper, Tianjin, 30th] After General Du Yuming led his troops into the Northeast, he is still continuing his northward advance. The Northeast Nine Provinces Security Headquarters moved into Jinzhou to conduct official business on the evening of the 26th.

[Associated Press, Chongqing, 30th] The National Army's progress in the Northeast has once again slowed, pending the completion of the Sino-Soviet negotiations. Detailed plans for the National Army's airlift to the Northeast are currently under consideration. However, the general impression here is that China wishes to proceed cautiously to avoid international disputes arising from overzealous actions. However, the National Army south of Jinzhou is continuing to strengthen its position, clearing areas occupied by miscellaneous troops. It is heard that the Communist Army has destroyed the bridges between Jinzhou and Jinxi. After receiving news yesterday that the National Army had occupied Jinxi, it can be seen that some of the bridges must have been repaired.

### Yellow River Embankment and Guangdong-Hankou Railway; Repair Projects to Commence Soon

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 30th] Chiang Tingfu received the press on the afternoon of the 30th and, in response to reporters' questions, stated: (1) The purpose of this office selling some materials to launch post-war relief efforts is to avoid increasing the issuance of national currency and to stabilize society and curb prices by withdrawing legal tender. The drop in grain prices in Shanghai, Tianjin, and other places is a significant fact. (2) School students cannot collectively request relief from this office. The targets of this office's relief efforts are righteous people and refugees. 4,000 people have been transported back to their hometowns by this office from Chongqing. (3) Repairing the Yellow River embankment is a major project planned by this office. Experts have been engaged to start checking the repairs, and the project will begin soon. The United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) has agreed to supply all the machinery for the project. Workers will be paid with work-for-food, but the funds for wage payments will be allocated by the national treasury. The Guangdong-Hankou Railway repair project will also be started by this office. 1,500 UNRRA technical personnel will continue to come to China to work. (4) Regarding relief efforts in Taiwan, this office has obtained UNRRA's approval to directly ship two shiploads of fertilizer. They can arrive early next year. Each ship will also be loaded with dozens of tons of medicine and more than a dozen card vehicles. After these materials are purchased at market price by the people of Taiwan, the proceeds will be used to purchase local sugar and coal to be transported to the mainland. (5) Relief work in the Northeast cannot be started because there is no seaport available. (6) The lack of transportation is the most difficult problem currently facing this office. UNRRA will supply 55,000 tons of new and old ships, including 15 from the Taikoo and Jardine Matheson companies. At the same time, the United States will provide 200 landing motorboats from the Philippines and Ryukyu Islands for our use. Each boat can load 2,400 tons of materials. Currently, 80 boats have arrived. There are also 600 tugboats for our use, each of which can tow wooden boats of 150 tons. (7) This office is not responsible for compensating factories in the recovered areas that have closed down due to war or have been bombed. Capitalists will not be rescued, but relief will be provided to unemployed workers.

### President Truman Announces; Marshall to Come to China Within Days; Will Clarify Policy to be Implemented in China

[United States Information Service, Washington, 29th] President Truman announced at a press conference today that the new special envoy to China, Marshall, will travel to China in three or four days to carry out his new mission. The President said that the instructions for Marshall are currently being drafted and will be partially released within days. Marshall will clarify the policy that the United States will implement in China. Regarding Hurley's criticism of the State Department when he resigned on November 27, President Truman declined to comment. President Truman also announced that he believes that the United Nations organization can discuss all special problems that disrupt the international situation within 90 days, therefore he and Stalin and Attlee do not need to continue to hold meetings. President Truman solemnly stated that the United States will fully support the United Nations organization in carrying out this new mission.

[Associated Press, Chongqing, 30th] The Communist Party's Xinhua Daily wrote an article today welcoming Marshall, but hopes that this new American envoy will immediately withdraw American troops from China and send them home to spend the Christmas holidays. At the same time, the right-wing "World Daily" said: "We welcome Marshall because we firmly believe that he will keep America's strong, definite, and most wise Far East policy unchanged, so as to ensure the balance of power in the international community."

[Central News Agency, Washington, 29th] Some people suggest that Truman's economic representatives, Lock and Haytungutters, will soon return here and will consult with each other before Marshall sets off.

### There is Talk that Minister of Communications Yu Feipeng May Resign

[This Newspaper, Chongqing, 30th] According to well-informed sources, Minister of Communications Yu Feipeng has reportedly requested to resign due to health reasons.

### US Senate Foreign Relations Committee; Asks Hurley to Attend

[United Press, Washington, 30th] Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Connally announced that the committee will meet next Wednesday and request Hurley to attend and explain the background of his resignation. Hurley said, "I have not agreed to attend the Foreign Relations Committee's closed-door meeting. If Congress wants to hear a report publicly, I would be happy to accompany them, and the foreign policy towards China should be publicly stated. I sincerely hope that General Marshall can achieve success."

[United Press, Chongqing, 30th] The Communist Party-run Xinhua Daily today asked the United States to change its policy towards China, saying that Ambassador Hurley's resignation is an excellent opportunity. There are 50,000 American troops in North China, which the newspaper believes is the greatest shame Hurley has inflicted on the American people.

### Our Country Will Build; Modern Factories; US to Supply Electrical Equipment

[China-England News Agency, New York, 30th] International Electric Company Manager White said that modern factories with high-speed production will produce electrical equipment, household appliances, and other electrical equipment worth $34 million annually to meet China's needs. In August of this year, the National Resources Commission of our country signed a contract with the company. The latter will be responsible for supplying engineers and technical personnel, designing and building complete factories and companies for China, and providing China with all knowledge related to electrical factories in the position of consulting engineers, but there is no financial relationship.

300 Students to Study in the United States

The company will also be responsible for training 300 Chinese students in New York for more than five years, teaching them various knowledge of electrical manufacturing. The selection of this group of students will be based on their educational level, specialized knowledge, and work experience before studying in the United States. White said that the implementation of this overall plan requires capital of $25 million and will be completed in 12 to 18 months. All factory management personnel will be Chinese. At the same time, other American industrial companies are also actively planning to assist China in building industries or to cooperate with China independently and permanently.

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 30th] Chairman Chiang previously sent Mo Dehui to the northeastern provinces to express his condolences on the 14th anniversary of the "September 18th" Incident. Now, he is again pained by the suffering of the people in the recovered provinces and cities. He has specially sent Ye Chucang and Niu Yongjian to Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces and Nanjing and Shanghai cities, Zhou Zhenlin and Liu Wendao to Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi provinces, Zhang Ji and Lu Zhonglin to Henan, Shandong, Hebei, Shanxi, Chahar, and Suiyuan provinces and Beiping and Tianjin cities, and Li Wenfan and Chen Jitang to Guangdong, Guangxi, and Taiwan provinces and Hainan Island to express his condolences on his behalf.

### Cultural Relics of Nanjing; Part 1

— Shen Zhi

Eight years ago, during the retreat from Nanjing, government agencies took some cultural relics west, but many public and private cultural relics were left behind in Nanjing. In particular, over the past eight years, the Japanese puppets have collected artifacts from all over the occupied areas, making the situation of Nanjing's cultural relics very chaotic. Among them, the things originally left in Nanjing can be easily understood in the future clearance because the various institutions have a catalog to check for any losses. As for those collected from other places, it may take considerable time for the government to understand the general loss situation.

In any case, to date, no one has been able to know the contents and losses of the sealed items, unless the work of the Wartime Cultural Relics Clearing Loss Investigation Committee can start as planned next month, or there may be preliminary results. In the process of cleaning up, some problems may occur, but I believe that these problems can only be solved in the process of work.

Regarding the cleaning up work, the Ministry of Education has already organized the above-mentioned cleaning up committee, with Deputy Minister Hang Liwu as the director. Its nature seems to focus on the aspect of preparing for Japanese compensation, so its task is particularly heavy.

After the surrender of Japan, the Ministry of Education sent the young archaeologist Mr. Jin Zutong to Nanjing to preside over the sealing of cultural relics. He was one of the second batch of personnel to come after Deputy Chief of Staff Leng Xin, etc. At that time, he, together with the Army Headquarters, sealed up the locations of the cultural relics, and then sealed them with the seals of the Ministry of Education's Nanjing-Shanghai District Special Commissioner's Office. Because the action was relatively quick, it is believed that few items were lost. Until now, each place is still sealed as before, and visits are declined.

But the cleaning up committee's office will be established next month, at the Palace Museum in Chaotian Palace. Regarding the cleaning up methods, they have been formulated and are now in Minister Zhu Jia-hua's bag. He took it to Peiping. As long as he returns south, it can be approved and implemented. It is expected that it can be started within the next month. The office in Chaotian Palace will be a cleaning up center in the future. The committee will jointly unseal the items with relevant agencies or private individuals, as well as judicial supervision and local agencies. The general principle in the method is "returning items to their original owners." As for those with no original owner, the cases will be summarized and submitted to the government for further review.

According to my investigation, the Wang Jingwei puppet regime's Executive Yuan once organized a "Cultural Relics Preservation Committee" to manage these cultural relics. The "Committee" was divided into three committees: books, astronomy and meteorology, and museums, to organize the three parts of cultural relics. This "Committee" was successively headed by Chu Ni Minyi, Xu Ni Liang, and Zhao Ni Zuping as "Directors."

As for private individuals, the most famous are the antiques, calligraphy, and paintings of Ni Jingwei and Liang Ni Hongzhi. Ni Wang's family property has been sealed. Liang Ni has fled without a trace. Liang Ni is a descendant of Liang Zhangju of Fujian. His family's collection is extremely rich, and he is the owner of the famous "Portraits of Emperors of All Dynasties." Cultural relics like these, even if Liang's descendants did not become traitors, should not be privately owned, and should be preserved by the state. But now, not only is Liang Ni Hongzhi still missing, but the location of his collection has not been found. In addition, the most famous is Chen Ni Qun. Chen has a private library on Jiangxi Road in Nanjing, called the "Zeren Library." It has more than 700,000 volumes of books, which is probably the largest collection of the three collections. (The other two are in Suzhou and Shanghai. The one in Shanghai has also been sealed by the Ministry of Education, and the one in Suzhou is said to be occupied by the army and has not yet been sealed. The total number of both places is also in the hundreds of thousands of volumes.) Most of them are books from the Song, Yuan, and Ming dynasties. In addition, the traitor's assets cannot be statistically calculated for a while. I hope the authorities will pay special attention. If unscrupulous people are allowed to fish in troubled waters, it will be a great loss to the country.

The responsible agencies in Nanjing are the Special Commissioner's Office of the Ministry of Education and the Wartime Cultural Relics Preservation Committee (the work of this committee will be transferred to the Cleaning up Committee in the future). To the best of their ability, all the public agencies of the Japanese puppets have been sealed. The sealed locations:

(1) The Puppet Museum in Jiming Temple (i.e., the former site of the Academia Sinica);

(2) The Puppet Central Library (i.e., the former site of Dongfang Middle School);

(3) The Zhugiao Geological Survey Institute;

(4) The Zijin Mountain Observatory; (See attached photo)

(5) The Beijige Meteorological Observatory.

In addition, there is Chen Ni's private "Zeren Library." (To be continued tomorrow)

### Communist Army Conscripts Japanese Artillery; Forces Them to Bomb Guisui City; Small Skirmishes Continue in the Suburbs of Baotou

[Central News Agency, Guisui, 29th] It has been confirmed that the Communist Party has re-armed surrendered Japanese troops and attacked the National Army. At around 3 PM on the 25th of this month, the Communist Army suddenly bombarded Guisui's new city with artillery. More than 20 shells landed in the city. A shell also landed in front of the reporter's residence, but fortunately it did not explode. At that time, the soldiers and civilians defending the city were skeptical of the artillery fire and its source. After days of careful investigation, a farmer revealed the truth. According to him, at noon on the 25th, he went to the bank of the Shahe River, five or six li southeast of Guisui New City, for business and suddenly encountered 1,000 to 2,000 Eighth Route Army soldiers. There were also two cars carrying two cannons. After arriving at the river bank, they fired at the city. Later, the National Army artillery retaliated on the city walls. The first shell hit one of the Eighth Route Army's cars on the east side, and the second shell landed near another car on the west side. Seeing the dense National Army artillery fire, the Eighth Route Army retreated along the original route. When the Eighth Route Army arrived at the river bank, they detained him. Because the Japanese soldier Yamada Shiro in the car knew him when he was in Guisui, he was released after his explanation. Yamada Shiro was originally an artilleryman of the 13th Regiment of the Japanese 16th Division stationed in Suiyuan. There were more than 30 Japanese soldiers, including Yamada Shiro, in the car this time.

[Central News Agency, Guisui, 29th] (1) There was a small skirmish in the suburbs of Baotou on the afternoon of the 28th. The Communist Army made two large-scale attempts to attack the city. (2) A contingent of the Communist Army that fled west from Baotou is now harassing and looting grain and conscripting men in Anbei County and other places along the Houkouzi area.

[United Press, Chongqing, 30th] According to Army Commander-in-Chief He Yingqin today, several well-known Japanese generals have joined the Chinese Communist Army, including Sakai, the former Chief of Staff of the Kwantung Army.

### Editorial: Rectifying the Officialdom!

The victory of the War of Resistance marks a new beginning with the people. The people's expectations of the government are enormous, but the performance of government personnel in the recovered areas may not fully satisfy the people's wishes. Gradually, the terms "Chongqing people" and "Shanghai people" have emerged, as if a chasm has been drawn between the people and the government. In reality, officials are not all corrupt, and the people are not without their traitors. A society gets the government it deserves, and the chasm is not easily drawn. However, in any case, this is a time for the government to start anew with the people. The government's first major task is nothing less than rectifying the officialdom!

The so-called "rectifying the officialdom" is a phrase with broad implications. Corrupt officials with scandalous records should be thoroughly investigated and severely punished. Those who abuse their power to oppress the people should be subject to accusations by the people at any time, without any favoritism. Those who were traitors during the occupation, flattering the enemy and deceiving the people, and who now shamelessly transform themselves, still wanting to meddle in officialdom and prey on the common people, should be prosecuted according to national law. These are all very obvious examples of rectifying the officialdom. In this regard, what the people hope from the government is to strengthen the exercise of supervisory power. The central government has the Control Yuan, and each province and region has a supervisory commissioner. The institutions have long been established, but their powers do not seem clear enough. Today, the supervisory organs can only impeach minor or unimportant figures. This is not to say that all higher-ranking officials are without fault, but the fragility of the supervisory system inevitably evokes a sense of regret. Therefore, in rectifying the officialdom, we hope that the supervisory organs will not only fulfill their duty of impeachment, but also fully exercise the powers granted to them by the state.

The inability to distinguish right from wrong and the lack of clear rewards and punishments have disheartened many. Because rewards and punishments are unclear, morality loses a standard. Evil deeds may not be punished, and good deeds may not be rewarded. While this may not encourage people to do evil, it is certainly not enough to encourage people to do good. Under such circumstances of declining discipline, the political atmosphere is becoming increasingly corrupt. The correction of this situation cannot rely solely on the power of the supervisory organs. The supervisory organs can only eliminate established facts of illegality and dereliction of duty, but they cannot manage the clarity of rewards and punishments in administration. This depends on the effective leadership of superiors over their subordinates, and especially on the wise selection of talent by superiors. Today, people often say that improving administrative efficiency by simply extending office hours and filling out all kinds of forms is futile if superiors at all levels fail to skillfully wield the power of reward and punishment. It must be understood that letting go of one bad element is a small matter, while corrupting general politics is a big matter. Killing one corrupt official only causes one family to cry. Instead of everyone crying along the way, why not just one family?

To rectify the officialdom, officials themselves must strictly examine their own behavior. Today's officialdom only seeks perfunctory formalities, regardless of actual results. Even the virtuous are not exempt from this, and the result is self-deception. The so-called "new official doctrine" has a very negative impression on the national psyche. This aspect of rectifying the officialdom does not rely solely on the supervisory organs, nor can it rely entirely on the wise measures of administrative leaders, but on how to establish a new style of political conduct. Getting rid of the superficial and embracing the substantial should be the hallmark of this new style. After a long war, the country is severely weakened. As public servants of the people, government officials cannot continue to be complacent and relapse into the bad habits of vanity and extravagance. After eight years of war, the people are exhausted. Civil servants should all be motivated and strive to be practical. Only in this way can a new style be established in politics and discipline restored. This is the most active point in rectifying the officialdom.

The so-called "popular sentiment" issue in the recovered areas is not a matter of recovery, but a matter of how to revitalize. At this time of national construction and the march towards democracy, the popular sentiment in the recovered areas should be revitalized. Rectifying the officialdom is the way to revitalize popular sentiment and unleash the power of the masses. We believe this is the most important step in rectifying the officialdom. Therefore, we hope that the central government will truly guarantee freedom of speech, so that the people have the power to express just opinions, and that unscrupulous officials will fear the public's clear judgment and restrain themselves. In addition, we hope that the central and local representative bodies should be established quickly and universally, so that the people can fulfill their supervisory duties in the reform of public administration. The essence and origin of modern democratic politics is "no taxation without representation." Faced with the opportunity of national construction and the march towards democracy, the central government, in accordance with the resolutions of previous meetings, should accelerate the establishment of representative bodies at all levels. This will certainly sweep away the bad habits of officialdom. Standing in the realm of public opinion, we will certainly not give up our due responsibilities, and we will use the eyes and hands of the public to help the central government supervise the people's public servants.

### Communist Army in Henan Provokes Disturbances

[Central News Agency, Luohe, 30th] (1) Eight or nine hundred communist troops violently attacked Tanghe North's Sheqi town around 3 PM on the 27th, but were repelled by the National Army. At 8 AM on the 28th, the communist troops regrouped over two thousand and continued to attack Sheqi town. Fierce fighting continued until 4 PM, and it was reported that there were more than two thousand reinforcements in their rear. (2) The communist troops in Xin'an town, near Zhumadian, attempted to sabotage the railway but were repelled by our forces on the 28th and fled to Huilong Temple near Zhugou.

[Central News Agency, Kaifeng, 30th] Military news: According to a telegram received from the front on the 29th, several thousand communist troops, entrenched in Shunheji, Liguan, Liulige, Tangwan Fuzhai, Baifang, Taoyuanji, and other places belonging to Caozhou, in the border region of Shandong and Henan, have been looting materials from various places for several days, loading them onto hundreds of large carts, and forcing the people to follow them towards Puyang.

(2) The 193rd Regiment of the communist forces north of Shangqiu destroyed two *li* of railway and two bridges near the southeast of Minquan, thirteen *hua li* away.

### Chongqing People's Organizations Issue Declaration Demanding the Communist Party Change Course

Obey Central Government Orders, Abandon Armed Struggle

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 30th] The Chinese Institute of Engineers, Labor Association, National Medical Association Joint Federation, National Chinese Medicine Association Joint Federation, Borderland Society, National Sports Advancement Association, United Nations China Comrades Association, and National Automobile Industry Association, and other eight organizations, jointly initiated the convening of national people's organizations. At 2 PM on the 30th, a tea party on state affairs was held at the National Diplomacy Association. More than three hundred representatives from over one hundred and sixty units of national organizations, including the New China Construction Association and the Catholic Cultural Association, temporarily elected Pan Yangshan, Kong Geng, Zhou Maozhi, Rao Shifen, Tang Jianyu, Zhuang Jing, Zheng Manqing, Zhu Qiluo, Dong Shouyi, Lu Ruobing, and He Baoren as the presidium, with Pan Yangshan as the chairman of the presidium. After reporting the purpose of the meeting, all present demanded that the government recognize the need to quell the internal strife and finally unanimously resolved to organize a People's Organizations Liaison Association, with the elected members of the presidium as preparatory personnel, and passed a declaration on the current situation, stating roughly: During the eight years of the War of Resistance, thanks to the firm and wise leadership of the Supreme Commander and the national effort to fight to the death, final victory was achieved. Fortunately, our rivers and mountains can be rebuilt, and unification is in sight. Unexpectedly, the Communist Party has other plans, brazenly causing chaos, treating the people as gullible and disregarding discipline. At the beginning of the War of Resistance, the Communist Party promised to accept central command, but for the past eight years, it has remained separate, even colluding with the enemy and puppets to attack the National Army, only caring about expanding its strength and cultivating its followers. Its transgressions and illegal activities are too numerous to mention. After the enemy surrendered, it dispatched generals and troops to seize cities and territories, block the National Army, obstruct the surrender, and even destroy all national transportation and resources. The central government, mindful of the suffering of the recovered areas, explicitly ordered a one-year suspension of conscription and grain requisition, while the so-called "liberated areas" have been levying exorbitant taxes and extorting supplies for up to several years, forcibly recruiting soldiers, burning houses, and using all kinds of vicious methods to harm our people. The enemy and traitors dared not do what they did, and they did not show the slightest concern. The people are displaced and suffering, and those who did not die under the enemy's iron hooves will die from the Communist Party's poison. All that our people seek today is a swift recovery, to provide shelter to refugees, to heal the wounded and save the dying, to reunite families, and to prevent the land from becoming barren again, so as to rebuild a life of peace and prosperity. Therefore, in the spirit that every individual is responsible for the fate of the nation, we join together in calling upon the Communist Party authorities to change course, respect the will of the people, respect public opinion, cherish the nation, cherish the country, immediately cease all military actions, unconditionally return political power and the military to the government, obey the central government's military and political orders, abandon armed struggle, and follow the proper path for political parties. It should be understood that political struggle has a clear path, and the nation's lifeline and the people's lives should not be destroyed. The army is meant to protect the country and defend the people, not to turn inward, how can it be used for internal strife and turn to slaughtering compatriots? What to do is for the Communist Party to choose carefully. However, today is the era of democracy, and our people must also think about how to cherish themselves, not be intimidated by violent parties, forget their great responsibilities, but work together to eliminate misfortune.

### Communist Army Threatens to Invade in Multiple Directions; Tense Situation within Shandong Province; Zibo Mining Area Suffers Destruction, Coal Production Halted

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 30th] The communist army is rampant in Shandong, and the situation is tense. According to a telegram received from Shandong by relevant parties: (1) The communist army led by Yang Guofu, with more than 20,000 troops, hundreds of machine guns, and thirty cannons, has infiltrated the Qingqian town area, fifty *li* east of Jinan, with the intention of attacking Jinan city. (2) The communist armies from southern Shandong, Anhui, and Henan claim to have 200,000 troops and will invade Shandong in four directions. (3) The communist army advancing north along the Tianjin-Pukou Railway forcibly conscripted laborers along the way and destroyed transportation. Those who refused were buried alive. The Tengzhou-Zaozhuang section of the railway has been completely destroyed. (4) The 6th Independent Regiment of the communist army in southern Shandong forcibly conscripted 5,000 young men in Linfen and sent them to the Zibo area to carry out destruction.

The telegram mentioned the situation of the communist army's harassment in the Zibo mining area, stating that the Wang Jian'an division of the communist army's Central Shandong Military Region occupied the area for more than twenty days. During that time, all important machines, materials, and resources in the mines were destroyed and transported away, leaving nothing behind. The coal pits have been flooded, and all production has been halted. The livelihoods of 100,000 workers are in dire straits, and the impact has led to the decline of all industries and the near bankruptcy of the rural economy.

### Truman Not Worried that Soviet Union is Creating Another War; Hopes United Nations Work Will Be Completed Within Three Months

[United Press, Washington, 29th] President Truman reiterated at a press conference today that he is not worried that Soviet policies are creating another war. A reporter asked: Some people in the world now have two questions: one is that the Soviet Union is not cooperating with other countries to ensure world peace, and the other is that Soviet policies will inevitably lead to war. What does the President think? Truman answered with the aforementioned belief. He also said that if the United Nations can proceed according to its proper course, there will be no need for any more summit meetings. A reporter asked: If the policies and institutions of the United Nations regarding the control of Germany need to be revised, will it be necessary for the President to hold a meeting with Marshal Stalin and Premier Attlee? The President replied that he does not advocate holding a special meeting and hopes that the United Nations can take over the various issues handled by the Three-Power Conference within ninety days. Regarding the issue of German control, the Four Allied Powers are conducting negotiations to revise the Potsdam Declaration. The United States advocates that any resolution to be amended must be unanimously approved by the United Nations Control Commission.

Next Year will be the Turning Point for Peace and War

[United Press, London, 29th] A few weeks ago, a reporter predicted that next year will be the turning point for peace and war. Whether we can achieve true peace or humanity will commit suicide with atomic energy will be known by then. During this period, we will encounter one by one the important international issues on which peace depends, and the differences of opinion among the Big Three are especially dangerous, as the harmony and cooperation of the Big Three are the guarantee of peace and security. If the United Nations can accelerate its operation to solve the current difficulties, the chances of avoiding conflict will increase even more. When asked of members of the preparatory committee, they all agreed with this observation. If we know the urgency of the matter and accelerate progress, this peace mechanism can be expected to be established in a month. Then the world's major problems, whether political or economic, can be submitted for discussion. The scope of the problems is extremely wide, and all those that endanger international peace are included, with the control of atomic energy being the most important. If we proceed according to this principle, then problems that were previously considered irrelevant to international affairs and only internal affairs of a country will also be handled by this mechanism. The Chinese civil war is one example, because it endangers world peace. This is not to disrespect national sovereignty. On the contrary, purely domestic affairs are absolutely not allowed to be interfered with, but countries may also submit local problems to the United Nations for discussion, such as the Arab-Jewish conflict. Similar problems can be submitted as precedents in the future.

United Nations Organization Headquarters Location Problem

[Central News Agency, London, 29th] The Eighth Special Committee of the United Nations Organization Preparatory Committee met in the afternoon of the 29th to continue discussing the issue of the location of the permanent headquarters of the United Nations Organization. The central issue is whether the permanent location of the United Nations Organization should be established in an autonomous international zone or in an international zone located within the territory of a country, such as the nature of Tangier. The British representative, Baker, advocated giving the area where the permanent headquarters of the United Nations Organization is established the greatest possible degree of internationality. He suggested establishing a United Nations Special Zone, where the United Nations can enjoy freedom from interference. Washington, D.C. is one example. Baker also supported the Executive Committee's proposal to establish a United Nations Broadcasting Station, free from the control or supervision of all countries. The Belgian Foreign Minister agreed with the second system, that is, he agreed that the permanent headquarters of the United Nations Organization should be located in an international zone within the territory of a country. The Dutch representative asked the committee to pay attention to the need to make a decision on the issue he raised yesterday, which was whether the permanent headquarters of the United Nations Organization should be established in a large country or in a small country. He believed that if the decision was favorable to a large country, some precautionary measures should be taken to prevent the danger of strong public opinion interference in the country where the United Nations Organization is located. The Canadian representative believed that both plans are extreme, so he agreed with a compromise system, with half under international management and half relying on the assistance of the host country.

### Soviet Union Refuses Iranian Army to Move North

If Iranian Town Uprisings Occur, Soviet Union will Further Increase Troops Stationed in Iran

[Central News Agency, Washington, 29th, Reuters] The Iranian Ambassador to the United States stated today after calling on President Truman that the Soviet Union has refused to allow the Iranian army to move north. They claim that the Iranian army's move north will lead to bloodshed and threaten that if we attempt to suppress the internal chaos, the Soviet Union will increase the number of Soviet troops stationed in Iran. The Iranian Ambassador told U.S. Secretary of State Byrnes that Iran has lodged two new protests with the Soviet Union: (1) The continued presence of Soviet military personnel in Tehran has created the most tense situation in the area. (2) The rebellion in Azerbaijan is expanding and has now spread to Tabriz. Therefore, we earnestly request the Soviet Ambassador to take urgent steps to eliminate the obstacles to Iranian army reinforcements.

[United Press, Washington, 29th] All efforts by the Iranian government to send reinforcements to the defending army to carry out orders have been blocked by Soviet soldiers. The Soviet army's prohibition of the Iranian army's advance is an infringement of Iranian independence and a violation of the Tehran Agreement. It is reported that the rebel army is rushing towards Tehran, and the situation is quite critical.

[Reuters, London, 30th] The Iranian Parliament may hold a meeting today to discuss the Iranian-Soviet dispute.

### U.S. President Does Not Support Rebuilding of Jewish State

[United Press, Washington, 30th] President Truman told reporters today that he no longer supports the rebuilding of a Jewish republic in Palestine because the situation is different now than it was in the past, so his position has also changed.

[Reuters, Cairo, 30th] The Arab League Council drafted a document last night in response to British Foreign Secretary Bevin's statement on the Palestine issue. It will be sent to London and Washington at the end of this week, and its contents will be announced after it is sent.

[United Press, Washington, 29th] William Green, President of the American Federation of Labor, today appealed to British Prime Minister Attlee on behalf of seven million members, asking him to immediately stop the "policy of death and destruction against Jews by British forces in Palestine."

### Bad Weather Between India and Shanghai; U.S. Aircraft Flights Terminated

[United Press, Washington, 30th] The Department of the Army announced today that the U.S. Air Force has lost several aircraft and some crew members due to poor weather conditions on flights from India to Shanghai, so flights have been terminated. According to sources in Shanghai, U.S. aircraft are now assembled in various locations, and China can purchase them if it wants. A spokesman for the Department of the Army did not comment on this statement but said that the equipment of the Army Air Force is in accordance with peacetime navigation safety rules, and it is not allowed to take unnecessary risks in adverse weather conditions, resulting in the loss of aircraft and crew members. According to a United Press report from Shanghai on Monday, at least eleven aircraft involved in a large-scale flight of 700 U.S. aircraft crashed between Kunming and Shanghai due to adverse weather conditions. Fortunately, several crew members were rescued.

### Balkan Soviet Troop Movements Busy; For the Dardanelles Strait, They Demand Turkey Cede Armenian Territory; Tanks and Artillery Practice on the Bulgarian-Turkish Border

[United Press, New York, 29th] The situation in the Balkans is once again becoming tense. A contingent of Soviet troops, equipped with tanks and heavy artillery, has recently arrived in the area of Bulgaria bordering Turkey and is conducting exercises. According to reliable sources, the Soviet forces in Bulgaria number 200,000. The Bulgarian army is currently being reorganized and trained by Soviet officers, effectively becoming an auxiliary force to the Soviet Union. The reason for these troop movements is primarily related to two major issues: (1) the Soviet-Turkish dispute over the control of the Dardanelles Strait, and (2) the Soviet demand for the cession of a portion of Turkish Armenia. The Soviet Union is eager to secure a free passage to the Mediterranean. Therefore, at the final meeting of the Big Three in Potsdam, the Soviet Union proposed amending the Montreux Convention. President Truman advocated the organization of an international committee to jointly manage the Dardanelles Strait, but the issue remains unresolved. Disputes have already arisen between Turkey and the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union has further demanded that Turkey cede Kars, Ardahan, and Artvin, three territories in Turkish Armenia, to the Soviet Union, exacerbating the situation. Currently, these three areas have all become strategic locations, of immense value to the Soviet Union. Turkish newspapers have resolutely declared that the Turkish government will never cede the above three territories, maintaining a firm stance with little possibility of compromise. However, it remains questionable whether Turkey has sufficient strength to back up its position. Judging from the current situation, the Soviet Union appears eager to resolve these two major issues as soon as possible. Bulgaria will undoubtedly stand with the Soviet Union. Although the provisional government in Sofia has been criticized by the United Kingdom and the United States for not representing the entire nation and has not been recognized, it is heavily communist in its leanings.

### University News in This City

[Central News Agency] Shanghai University is preparing for its restoration since the end of the war. In addition to the active efforts of the university authorities, alumni are also working hard to promote the restoration, hoping to quickly restore the university to its former glory. The alumni association aims to strengthen this important work, improve the organization, expand its operations, establish close contact with alumni returning to Shanghai, and hold regular alumni gatherings to jointly plan the revival of the alma mater.

### Mingde School Building Dispute

The Education Bureau Sent a Letter Asking for Enforcement, but There Was No Action; Concerned Persons Request Authorities to Conduct a Thorough Investigation

[City News] The private Mingde Girls' Primary and Secondary School was originally located at 2 Huajinfang, Huajin Road, Nanshi. The school buildings were built over many years. During the War of Resistance, most of the buildings were destroyed by bombing, leaving only eight small school buildings in the rear. After the National Army withdrew to the west, the school temporarily resumed classes at the current address of 688 Xiafei Road until now. The remaining school buildings in Nanshi were repaired and leased to Zhu Ziqing in June of the 32nd year of the Republic (1943) for a one-year term. The contract clearly stated that the tenant should move out after the term expired, but the tenant repeatedly delayed the move.

Contract Renewed

The school had no choice but to accommodate the situation and continue to sign a contract with Zhu Ziqing, stipulating that the house would be handed over at the end of May of the 34th year of the Republic (1945). However, when the term expired, Zhu Ziqing, fearing that the school would take it back as agreed, secretly reported to the puppet government that the principal of the school, Mei Songxian, was an anti-Japanese element. The houses were then taken over by the Puppet Government's Chongqing Property Management Committee.

Intent to Occupy for a Long Time

Zhu Ziqing stopped paying rent to the school and directly signed a lease with the puppet "Chongqing Property Management Committee" in order to occupy the property for a long time. Now that the War of Resistance has been won and the country has been restored, in order to plan for the restoration of the school, the school submitted a detailed report to the Municipal Education Bureau in October, requesting that the school building be ordered to be returned and that the traitor Zhu Ziqing be severely punished. After the Education Bureau sent people to investigate and found that all the facts presented were true, it sent a letter to the Yimiao Branch of the Police Bureau on the first day of last month, asking them to order the house to be returned and instructing the school to bring the original letter and negotiate with the branch to handle the matter.

Limited Time to Move Out

The director of the branch, Director Qian, personally received the school and stated sternly that he would enforce the case in the fastest way possible. If anyone dared to delay, they would be arrested. However, many days passed and no action was taken. After repeated inquiries, he always said that the tenant had been given a limited time to move out. But in fact, nothing had happened. The director of the Yimiao Branch suddenly claimed that the matter was within the scope of civil affairs and that due to legal restrictions, the case could not be enforced. It was reported to the Police Headquarters. The incident was abrupt and caused an uproar. It is said that the school has asked all relevant parties to conduct a thorough investigation of the facts and uphold justice in order to protect education.

### Chengyou Cup Basketball: Donghua Beats Feima, Shantou Beats Liangxi; Two Friendly Matches Today

Yesterday, the weather turned cold suddenly, but the atmosphere in the China Youth Basketball Hall was very enthusiastic. Donghua and Feima first faced each other. Donghua was too relaxed because of its confidence in winning. Feima was determined to fight to the death and was full of energy. Therefore, the Feima team took the lead all the way. After 15 to 9, Donghua did not dare to be negligent. Han Longhai made every shot, so he surpassed and led. In the first half, Che Hua finally led by 25 to 17. In the second half, the war between the cities was still not very tight, but Feima was powerless because of its poor ball skills. In the end, Donghua won by 47 to 29, and Han Longhai alone scored 26 points, which is not easy.

Then the Shantou team played Liangxi. The latter had the help of Yu Huanzi yesterday. The whole team was composed of veterans. The Shantou team reused young players such as He Lide and Ji Nankang. After the start of the game, both sides were very cautious. Liangxi had many opportunities, but they failed to grasp them all due to a lack of assurance. The Shantou team had good connections and was not flustered. Chen Qingjiang and Lin Weisong had many wonderful moves. When the first half was over, the Shantou team had 15 points and Liangxi had 8 points. In the second half, Liangxi replaced Yang Yuanlong with Yu Huanzi. The defense became lax, and the offense was not effective. Therefore, the game was lost by one move. The Shantou team was able to control the situation. Chen Qingjiang was very active. Shantou finally defeated this strong opponent. The score was 37 to 20.

Starting at 7:30 this afternoon, there will be two China-US basketball friendly matches in the Qiaozhong Youth Gymnasium in Baisen. It is said that tickets will still cost 100 yuan. The order is as follows:

### To Adjust Food Supply, A Large Quantity of Flour Will Be Sold

Liu Hongsheng Told Our Reporter Yesterday

[Our Exclusive Interview] Liu Hongsheng, Director of the Shanghai Branch of the National Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, told our reporter yesterday: In order to adjust the food supply in this city, the bureau will sell a large amount of flour in Shanghai in the short term. The bureau has formulated a plan to hand over a portion of the wheat imported from the United States to various factories in the city for milling, and then allocate it to various flour retailers and grain stores in the city at a specified price.

Public Sale

There are about 3,000 retailers in this city. The initial allocation is about 50 bags per store. Liu also said: The main goal of the bureau is to promote relief work. Regarding the flour distribution, the bureau adopts a simple commercial method to adjust "supply" and "demand" so that hoarders cannot obtain windfall profits. The bureau

In Promoting Distribution

Always takes the principle of not giving economic blows to manufacturers and farmers. Therefore, in balancing prices, the bureau will adopt a gradual approach. At the same time, legitimate retailers will also be given legitimate profits. In this way, on the one hand, food prices can be suppressed, and on the other hand, the economic structure of this city can become more stable day by day. In the past, the ratio of rice to flour prices in this city was one dan of rice equals four bags of flour. Currently, the price of flour has been raised due to shortages. The bureau plans to

Suppress Flour Prices

So that it can restore the previous ratio of four to one. According to a grain merchant in this city, the price of flour has fallen sharply recently because it is rumored that the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration has a large amount of flour for sale. It is said that if the price of flour falls back, the price of rice in this city will fall accordingly.

### Ship Allocation Committee Established Simultaneously in Chongqing and Shanghai: Aims for Maximum Efficiency in Water Transport

The Ship Allocation Committee will be established separately in Chongqing and Shanghai this morning.

Remarks by Mr. Xu Xueyu

This newspaper's reporter recently interviewed Xu Xueyu, Secretary-General of the National Ship Allocation Committee, who had just returned to Shanghai from Chongqing. According to him, the main task of the committee is to rationally allocate ships nationwide so that all of China's current water transport tools can achieve maximum efficiency. At present, China's ship tonnage is very small, while the national needs are very urgent. Therefore, all ships must be fully utilized, and shipping routes must also be adjusted. Currently, all ships in the country (including naval transport ships and privately operated commercial ships) are uniformly allocated by the committee.

### Comforting National and Allied Forces

— Qian Dajun

All citizens of Shanghai, to thank the immortal achievements and the hard work of the soldiers on the battlefield, today use excitement and passionate sincerity to comfort all the officers and soldiers of the National and Allied Forces in Shanghai. This is completely inspired by the heart, and cannot be described in writing even to the slightest degree.

The officers and soldiers of the National and Allied Forces, during this World War, either fought on the sea, or fought in the air, or pierced through [difficult terrain], crossed high mountains, stepped on mud, waded through deep water, faced fierce enemies, and ruthless artillery fire, risking death and life, regardless of everything. Even those who have not personally experienced or witnessed it can imagine the hardship and danger. All our compatriots across the country, regardless of men, women, old or young, regardless of north, south, east or west, during this war, have always cared about the fighters on the battlefield. This feeling of remembrance is hidden in everyone's heart and becomes deeper as time goes on. Today, all the citizens of Shanghai, in accordance with the regulations of the National Comforting Headquarters, are comforting the National and Allied Forces in Shanghai, simply to offer the sincerity accumulated in their hearts to the fighters on the battlefield.

The officers and soldiers of the National and Allied Forces, either from the war zones in various parts of China, or from other battlefields, are meeting in Shanghai, an international commercial city, for the first time. It can also be said that today is the first time that millions of citizens of Shanghai have met with the officers and soldiers of the National and Allied Forces who have long been on the battlefield. The officers and soldiers of the National Forces and the officers and soldiers of the Allied Forces fought side by side in war, sharing life and death. Today, in Shanghai, they are as close as family members. This makes all the citizens of Shanghai feel that only by being based on precious friendship can we promote sincere cooperation and lay the foundation for lasting peace. In addition to being very pleased, everyone should have a common belief: that the world of the future will not allow the flames of aggression to exist again, will not allow the tyranny of dictatorship to exist again, and will not allow cruel wars to exist again. We must work together to ensure world peace and move towards the prosperous road of human civilization, freedom and happiness. In particular, this war occurred on the Chinese battlefield and ended on the Chinese battlefield. Our compatriots suffered the deepest pain and made the greatest sacrifices. We not only care about the National Forces who defended our territory and the Allied Forces who fought side by side with us on various battlefields at all times, but also have the utmost respect for them. Today, all the citizens of Shanghai, based on this feeling and sincere respect, express comfort and gratitude to the officers and soldiers of the National and Allied Forces.

To the Allied Forces in Shanghai, some of whom are about to return home because their mission has been completed and cannot stay in Shanghai for a long time, I would like to express my deep regret on behalf of all the citizens of the city. To some of the Allied Forces who are staying in Shanghai, if our hospitality is not sufficient, I would like to express my infinite apology on behalf of all the citizens of the city.

### Social Services: This Newspaper Actively Promotes and Launches Scholarship Aid Campaign

China vs. U.S. - Six Grand Matches

Impoverished Students - Grateful to Tears

This newspaper has been advocating for a scholarship aid campaign for readers for four and a half years, having held it for nine sessions. During this period, it has been warmly supported by people from all walks of life, and the results have been remarkable. More than 25,000 impoverished students have been assisted. During the War of Resistance, compatriots were displaced and suffered greatly. Fortunately, these lovely impoverished students received assistance from enthusiastic people from all walks of life, enabling them to continue their studies and continue their education. This is of profound significance and merit, directly rescuing those who have dropped out of school and indirectly cultivating talents for the country's restoration and construction. Now that the War of Resistance has been won and the light of day has returned, all undertakings urgently need to be restored. The scholarship aid campaign should be actively launched. The current semester is about to end, and my colleagues, adhering to the purpose of scholarship aid over the years, should plan ahead for the fundraising of the tenth scholarship aid fund to avoid digging a well only when thirsty. We hope that wise people from all walks of life will provide assistance, and we will be extremely grateful!

Today, we want to report good news to readers about the scholarship aid campaign. This can be said to be the first great and amazing good news in the Shanghai sports world after the victory of the War of Resistance! The fact is this: Dr. Gu Yuqi, President of Tongde Medical College, and the authorities of this newspaper jointly launched the China-U.S. basketball tournament, aiming to improve basketball skills and connect feelings. The proceeds from the ticket sales will be used for the scholarship aid funds of this newspaper and Tongde Medical College to help countless impoverished students. Zhang Weixiang, General Manager of China Union Chemical Works, is proceeding separately with the invitation of teams and the dates and locations of the matches. At this moment, we can first inform you that the teams will be the most powerful U.S. Military Police Team, U.S. Air Force Team, and U.S. Navy Team stationed in Shanghai. There is no doubt about their outstanding basketball skills. Our country will be represented by the China Union Team and the China Youth Team, which are known as the champions of Shanghai. These many heroes will have a wonderful performance to contribute to the thousands of fans. As for the date of the match, it will be in ten days, and the location will be the most spacious Chinese Sports Field (i.e., the Canidrome) in this city. In short, this is an unprecedented, grand, exciting, and enthusiastic charity event. We hope you will wait and see!

### Please Donate to Leprosy Relief

This Newspaper Also Accepts Donations on Behalf

The China Leprosy Relief Association has been established for eighteen years. During this period, in addition to investigating leprosy in our country and engaging in publicity work, it has convened three national leprosy conferences, established branches in major cities, and successively built four or five new-style leprosy hospitals in Nanchang, Xinhua, Hainan, Qingyuan, and Dachang in Shanghai, benefiting the poor and sick. Its merits are great. The Shanghai Leprosy Sanatorium was completed in 1936. Its new-style construction and grand scale are unmatched by any other leprosy hospital in the country. Unfortunately, the war broke out the following year, and Dachang was the first to bear the brunt. In the midst of gunfire and bullets, all the patients were moved to the city. The leprosy hospital at No. 16 Bailinan Road is a temporary hospital after three relocations, covering an area of five or six acres. Although the building is simple, it is sufficient for use. Unexpectedly, at the end of last month, due to carelessness with fire, it was suddenly burned down. All equipment, beds, medicines, and patients' clothing were completely destroyed in the fire, with estimated losses of more than 2 million yuan. Fortunately, none of the 70 male and female patients were injured. However, at this time when the west wind is blowing and the weather is getting colder, if relief is not provided, these patients who are barely clothed and sleeping in the open air will inevitably suffer from cold and hunger. There is no shortage of philanthropists in Shanghai. We hope that you will generously donate to save those in distress. Donations can be made at the Social Service Section of Shenbao News and Xinhua Bank Headquarters, Shanghai Trust Company, or sent directly to the China Leprosy Relief Association Office at No. 53, Lane 612, Jing'an Temple Road. The patients urgently need iron beds, cotton clothing, quilts, shoes, and socks, whether new or old, are welcome.

### Seeking Donations for This Column

(1) Scholarship Aid Fund (2) Medical Aid Fund (3) Orphan Care Aid Fund (4) Maternity Aid Fund (5) Small Loan Fund, no matter how small the amount, we hope for a continuous stream of donations, so that we can actively promote it, benefit the poor, and the merit is immeasurable!

### The Contributions of the Little Elementary School Federation (Part Two)

— Lin Handa

(III) Strengthening Educational Beliefs and Improving Teaching Methods: Education is inherently a laborious and not always rewarding undertaking. The results of education are often difficult to see immediately, and those who lack confidence rarely find the joy of success to compensate for their hard work. If teachers in each school act independently, even if you are truly striving, you are merely a "lone army." Without like-minded individuals to discuss and encourage each other, it is easy to shake one's beliefs, and even become demoralized. Eventually, teaching is seen as barely better than "unemployment." Once faith and interest in the profession are lost, even excellent teachers will regress, let alone those who were not so excellent to begin with. Loneliness, monotony, lack of confidence, and the inability to muster the courage to strive for improvement are the common plights of elementary school teachers in Shanghai, and a major reason for the declining quality of elementary school teachers. The Little Elementary School Federation is a place to "boost the morale" of demoralized teachers. Membership has increased from two hundred and one to over one thousand two hundred, demonstrating the genuine need for such gatherings among teachers. When over a thousand people gather, they share their grievances and report their teaching experiences. This kind of spiritual interconnectedness and enthusiasm is almost unimaginable unless you observe it firsthand. Many people move forward hand in hand, and even on thorny paths, they feel full of energy, let alone when they are walking on the path of enlightenment? Their weekly Sunday gatherings not only passively listen to educational lectures, but also have other voluntarily participated programs. As far as I know, they also organize Mandarin classes, English classes, singing groups, drama troupes, publishing departments, social gatherings, etc. in different regions. I have heard large choruses combined by several of their schools, and I have also seen entertainment programs individually performed by each sub-region. In such enthusiastic gatherings, it is difficult to find any signs of demoralization. As for the improvement of teaching methods, although I have not conducted investigations in each school, I have heard the opinions expressed by members and read their notebooks, and I know that they have made great progress. Although many teaching and learning problems they raise from their actual experience cannot be completely solved, at least they already know self-criticism and are developing new teaching methods.

Recently, the Federation has resolved to strengthen communication with schools, so that this training association will not be limited to teachers, but also extended to principals. Principals will be invited to participate, and principal forums and principal lectures will be held to completely break the traditional class barriers between principals and teachers, achieving unity from top to bottom and serving education. This is not only the happiness of principals and teachers, but also the happiness of elementary school students and the nation.

I was initially surprised by the lovely spirit of the Little Elementary School Federation. Later, after reading their journal "Teacher Life," I learned that more than thirty educational celebrities and people who are devoted to education in Shanghai are consultants of the Federation. For example, Zhu Junti, Director of the National Education Department; Chen Qingshi, Director of the Secondary Education Department; Yu Qingtang, Director of the Social Education Department; as well as Mr. Chen Heqin, Sun Guiding, Zhang Yaoxiang, Jin Tongxian, Huang Jiping and several other gentlemen, are responsible for guiding them. It is evident that as long as leading educators are willing to come forward to guide them, the training of teachers in Shanghai can be improved. (The End)

### The Interest in Reading Newspapers and Books

— Huang Jiayin

The improvement in the intellectual level of the people during the eight years of China's resistance against Japan can be seen from the development of the news and publishing industries in the free areas.

Taking Chongqing alone, there are usually ten newspapers published daily. Among them, the better-selling ones can actually sell over 60,000 copies. This number has already exceeded the sales of most major city newspapers before the war. In terms of magazines, there are at least a hundred types in Chongqing. Among them, the sales of the more popular ones are comparable to when magazine and newspaper mail circulation was smooth throughout the country before the war. Imagine that before the war, major coastal cities and cultural centers such as Beiping, Tianjin, Shanghai, Hankou, Guangzhou, etc., and most of the provinces in the country, had fallen into enemy hands. The free areas that could circulate books and periodicals included less than a quarter of the area before the war, only a few provinces with relatively backward cultural standards, and under the difficult material conditions, printing, transportation, and mailing difficulties, and high book prices during the war, the circulation of a publication printed on local newsprint can still be comparable to that before the war, which cannot be said to be a miracle.

As for the atmosphere of reading, it is also very popular in the interior. Inside bookstores and magazine companies, there is a constant stream of people buying and reading books all day long. Especially in the evening, it is even more crowded.

The eight years of the war of resistance has increased the enthusiasm and interest of the Chinese people in reading newspapers, magazines, and books. This is also a phenomenon worthy of joy.

### Ciano's Diary and Him

— Yu Fan

In January 1944, the former Italian Foreign Minister Ciano was executed by Mussolini in Verona for treason. Hours before his execution, he carefully entrusted five thick volumes of his secretly kept diary to his beloved wife, Edda (Mussolini's daughter), in prison. Edda disguised herself as a poor woman and, with the diaries hidden under her ragged clothes, secretly fled to Switzerland.

Edda had written several times to plead with Mussolini to spare Ciano's life, but Mussolini hated him to the bone and refused to compromise. In the end, Edda, feeling alienated by the public, decided to make the diary public. Ciano's diary, starting in 1939, records the inside story of fascism in great detail and is a highly valuable exposé. Once made public, it caused a worldwide sensation.

It is said that Edda sold this diary to the Chicago Daily News for $75,000. The full book has not yet been published, but snippets have been eagerly carried by newspapers and magazines around the world.

"Ciano's Diary" has sparked a bidding war among publishers around the world. Since the overthrow of the Nazis, publishers have rushed to Germany to search for secret books. The situation is truly fervent, and even scraps of paper from some Nazi leaders have become highly sought after commodities. Most amusing of all, a group of disillusioned politicians and down-and-out military officers are now constantly talking about royalties and manuscript fees. These kinds of business deals are being negotiated in cafes and even in prisons.

"Goering's Notes" are just a few disorganized and incoherent sentences. After they were discovered, they attracted many people like a gold mine. Now a French intelligence officer has gotten hold of them first.

Hitler's mistress, Braun's diary, is another hot commodity. Recently, the American intelligence agencies discovered it in Braun's treasure chest. Some of the contents have now been published. It is an early love story from February to May 1935. Braun believes she has become "the greatest mistress in Germany and the world."

According to the diary, Hitler was often brutal and inhumane when he was in love. He often refused to fulfill the promises he had made, but sometimes he would give her a gift for no reason, without a word of explanation. Hitler would get angry when he saw her go out dancing, but the result of his anger was only avoiding her for a few weeks.

On her twenty-third birthday, the thing she wanted most was a hunting dog. But Hitler didn't even remember her birthday. "He came right on time today—but no dog. He didn't even ask me why I bought so many jewels—a necklace, earrings, a ring (these cost five pounds in total), they are very beautiful, I think he must like them, if he doesn't like them, he should buy me better ones."

As the diary shows, Braun was a greedy and jealous woman. It has not yet revealed anything about Hitler, but these diaries will undoubtedly help us to have a deeper understanding of this demon king. Ciano's Diary, Goering's Notes, and even Braun's Diary, these kinds of documents are not only a satisfaction for the curiosity of the curious, their more important significance is to provide psychologists with some precious research data, perhaps the post-war world will benefit from them and obtain more peace of mind.

Editor's Note: "Ciano's Diary" has been translated by Chen Fengxiong, the editorial director of the Chongqing National Gazette, and is being serialized in the newspaper's supplement. It has also been typeset for publication in Chongqing as a separate book, and may soon be published in Beiping and Shanghai. "Goering's Notes" have been translated in part by Liu Tongwei, a silks writer in the Chongqing Sweep Daily supplement, and is being serialized in the Sweep supplement.

### Unconquerable

— Shi Ding

In the summer of 1942, a group of Soviet soldiers were captured by the German army. Among them was a weak and emaciated prisoner of war named Yakov. Zhu Gershvili, is the son of Red Army Commander Stalin. As he walked past the German officers, he violated military protocol by not saluting the German officers. The German officer sternly asked him why he did not salute.

He replied: "I am only captured, not conquered."

Although Stalin's son died, the Soviet Union, with this spirit of not being conquered, finally saw the light of day again.

### The Enemy (10)

— Pearl Buck, translated by Zhu

He said, "I don't know what I'm going to do with you myself. Of course, I should hand you over to the police. You are a prisoner—no, don't tell me anything." He saw that the man seemed about to speak, and he raised his hand. "Unless I ask you, don't even tell me your name."

They looked at each other for a while, and the young man closed his eyes and turned to the wall.

"All right," he murmured, his mouth closing into a painful line.

Hana was waiting for Zhenxiong outside the door. He immediately saw that she was in some trouble.

She said, "Zhenxiong, Gongzi just told me that if we hide this person here again, people will no longer be able to stay here. She told me that they are saying that we have lived in America for too long, so we have forgotten to think of our own country first. They think we like Americans."

Zhenxiong hoarsely said, "That's not right, Americans are our enemies. But I have been trained, and I can't watch a person die when I am able to do something about it."

Hana anxiously said, "The servants can't understand this."

He also agreed, "Right."

The two of them seemed unable to say anything more, and life at home continued as usual. The servants became more and more vigilant. They still bowed carefully as before, but the eyes they watched their masters with were cold.

One day, the old gardener said, "It is very clear what our master should do." He had spent his whole life taking care of flowers, especially moss. He built the best moss garden in Japan for Zhenxiong's father, and always swept the bright green carpet clean, so that no leaves or dead needles could spoil its softness. He was now pinching a beetle on a bush, and said, "The son of my old master knows very well what he should do. This person is almost dead, why not let him continue to bleed?"

Business News

### Funds in the Bond Market Shift, Trends in Chinese Stocks Rejuvenate

Gold Prices Rise Slightly, US Dollars Stable

Spot gold prices still did not break free from fluctuation yesterday. Gold prices in other ports were reported to be low, and the market still appeared weak. However, due to loose capital positions, there was no lack of households buying on dips, and thus gradually rebounded. As a result, it closed up slightly by 10,000 compared to the previous session, and the trend seemed to improve slightly. Gold ornaments at silver shops were listed at 84,000, tael silver remained at 650, and silver dollars were stable, fluctuating between 455 and 460. The discount was still weak due to the lack of strength in the gold market and the lack of substantial outlets, but the underlying trend seemed stable, around 1.3 to 1.6 yesterday.

The US dollar was also extremely stable, fluctuating around 1,310 yuan. As a result, it closed up slightly by five yuan compared to the previous session. There was little activity in Hong Kong dollars, and as a result, it declined slightly. Australian pounds were still worth half of a US dollar, and rupees were weakly received at 0.25, extremely stable.

Although the buying interest in public bonds did not seem to stop, there was no lack of people wary of high prices. The city rose and fell rapidly, and the market was extremely changeable. Ultimately, most participants were optimistic about Chinese blue-chip stocks. Although the market appeared firm and strong, Category C once hit a high price of 620 yuan, then plummeted by more than 100 yuan. Although it rebounded slightly at the end, it ultimately felt powerless. As a result, hot issues in Category C and E declined slightly by ten yuan compared to the previous day, while unpopular issues in Categories A, B, and D fell by sixty yuan, and the price difference widened even more.

Due to consecutive days of cautious gains, the rising trend in Chinese stocks had been suppressed for a long time. With funds from the bond market continuously flowing in, even more poured in yesterday. A large number of public employees and activist elements participated in groups, and major investors also moved in to support factories. As a result, it was a surprise. As a result, large stocks performed well, increasing by 40 to 70 yuan, while small stocks each rose by more than five yuan. Barring external shocks, the trend is set to rejuvenate.

Foreign stocks were still flat at the beginning, and as a result, they also followed the trend of Chinese stocks to become firm and strong. Ewo Cotton Mill led the way, rising from around 1,500 to over 1,600. Among the smaller stocks, Ewo Transfers were popular, with many buyers, and are about to approach the 400 mark. As a result, they closed up by about 10% compared to the previous session.

The prices of various grains were weak yesterday. The rice market was slow as retail sales turned sluggish, and medium- and low-quality rice declined slightly by 100 to 200 yuan, forming a fluctuating situation. The price of oil fell by another 1,000 yuan as shipments of Qingdao barrel oil continued to pour in. Flour sales were also sluggish, and the processing of soybeans remained weak. The situation was uninspired.

Cotton yarn continued to decline because some manufacturers had completed export tax inspection procedures, and the supply of spot goods was relatively abundant. At the same time, the demand in Hankou and Chongqing turned sluggish, so prices could not be sustained. Fine yarn fell by 50,000 to 60,000, 20-count yarn fell by 10,000 to 20,000, and coarse yarn below 16-count fell slightly, about 5,000. Only inland merchants added some to their allocations throughout the day.

Sales of knitted goods were scarce and continued to decline. Some types remained at their original prices. Yarn prices did not rebound, and most factories were unwilling to sell at market prices. Those sold on the market were all speculators.

The market for dyes appeared to be thriving on the outside, but actual sales were still stagnant. Brokers were just propping up the market, so market prices continued to decline. The actual trading and quotations depend on supply and demand. Non-industry speculators heard that the German dye factories had been destroyed by the Allied forces and the source was cut off, so they still tried to support the market.
