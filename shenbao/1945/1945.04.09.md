Tokyo, 8th (Central News Agency Telegram) - Japanese Prime Minister Suzuki issued the following statement at 10:40 PM on the 7th, after the first cabinet meeting: In this war, Japan has encountered a situation that does not allow optimism.

If this continues, the foundation of Japan's survival will be in imminent danger. Currently, the great task of reversing the tide depends solely on our 100 million compatriots.

Although my body is weak, my spirit is still strong, so I will handle national affairs with the determination to stand at the forefront of my fellow citizens. I hope that you will also develop new fighting power with the great spirit of devoting your full effort until death, to protect the eternal peace of our nation.

Homeland Completes Iron Wall of Defense on Land and in the Air

Tokyo, 8th (Central News Agency Telegram) - Iwo Jima, the throat of southern Japan, has been entrusted to the enemy, and a fierce battle has broken out on Okinawa Island, a corner of the homeland. As the war situation becomes increasingly critical, the Japanese Army authorities have newly established a General Army Headquarters and an Air Army Headquarters to further strengthen the homeland defense system. Marshals Sugiyama and Hata will serve as Commanders of the General Army, and General Masakazu Kawabe will be the Air General Commander, in order to complete the iron wall of defense on land and in the air in the homeland. Marshals Sugiyama and Hata, who are now the supreme commanders of the defense of Japan, are the army elders second only to Marshal Terauchi. Marshal Sugiyama has served twice as Minister of the Army, Inspector General of Education, and Chief of the General Staff. Marshal Hata has also served twice as Inspector General of Education and has served as Minister of the Army. In addition, he served as Commander of the China Expeditionary Army for three and a half years, directing operations on the mainland and establishing outstanding military achievements. Now, the appointment of the two Marshals as General Army Commanders will further consolidate the defense of the Japanese homeland. In addition, General Kawabe Masakazu, the Air General Commander, has served as the supreme commander of the army in the Burma area. Afterwards, he served as the Commander of the Central Military District, actively defending the homeland. In the future, as enemy planes attack the homeland more severely, the activities of the Japanese air defense forces under the command of General Kawabe are expected to be quite considerable.

### Over a Hundred Enemy Planes Crashed Near Tokyo and Nagoya, Results of Japanese Air and Air Defense Forces Confirmed

Tokyo, 8th (Central News Agency Telegram) - On the morning of the 7th, the U.S. Air Force, with a combined formation of about 120 B-29s and P-51s, invaded Tokyo, and about 150 B-29s bombed the vicinity of Nagoya. The Japanese side immediately launched a fierce counterattack against the enemy aircraft. It has since been determined that 14 aircraft, including one P-51, were shot down near Tokyo, and about 40 were damaged. Near Nagoya, 16 aircraft were shot down and more than 40 were damaged, achieving a brilliant victory of shooting down and destroying a total of more than 110 aircraft.

Tokyo, 8th (Central News Agency Telegram) - On the morning of the 7th, a combined formation of enemy air force, including a total of 130 fighters and bombers, including B-29s from the Mariana Islands base and P-51s from the Iwo Jima base, carried out the first joint bombing of Tokyo. A powerful formation of about 150 B-29s also attacked Nagoya. The enemy planes attacking Tokyo invaded western Tokyo from the vicinity of Sagami Bay and attacked the factory area. At the same time, about 150 P-51s invaded the homeland from the Kumano Sea area. First, a small number of planes attacked the Hanshin area, and the main force passed through Ise Bay and invaded Nagoya, bombing the factory area for 50 minutes from about 10:00 AM. Also, around 9:40 AM, several other planes attacked Oshima and Niijima. Japanese air units and ground air defense units immediately engaged in a fierce battle. The results are currently being investigated. The damage from this air raid on Tokyo was minor. Also, enemy planes dropped many bombs on Nagoya, and dropped several bombs on Shizuoka and Hamamatsu when fleeing. The fact that the U.S. Air Force from the southern base jointly attacked with B-29s and P-51s, and at the same time bombed the Tokyo and Nagoya areas with a powerful formation of more than 100 planes, proves that the US military's bombing campaign against the Japanese homeland is intensifying.

### On the New Japanese Cabinet

After Japanese Prime Minister Koiso submitted his resignation on the 5th of this month, General Suzuki was ordered to organize a successor cabinet and began to consider candidates for cabinet members. All members were decided on the afternoon of the 7th, and the official appointment ceremony was held that evening. At this point, the new cabinet, supported by all parties, was formally formed.

At a time when the battle for Okinawa Island is unfolding, enemy malicious rumors about this cabinet reshuffle in our ally, Japan, are inevitable. Therefore, we must specifically point out the true significance of this Japanese cabinet reshuffle.

First, the Japanese cabinet reshuffle is not significantly related to Japan's national policy. This is because Japan's fundamental national policy was proclaimed in the "Declaration of War" on December 8th, which is a national policy that any cabinet must absolutely abide by. The change of cabinet personnel only aims to better adapt to the environment and use more effective methods to achieve this national policy. Looking back on the Great East Asia War, the Japanese cabinet has been reorganized three times, but its national policy of following the Declaration of War to seek self-preservation, self-defense, and liberation of East Asia has always been consistent, which can be seen as clear proof. Therefore, any speculation involving a change in Japanese national policy has no factual basis and is not credible.

Second, the basic task of the new cabinet of our ally, Suzuki, is entirely to focus politics on the decisive battle, to more closely coordinate command and national policy, in order to maximize the national strength. Recalling that last July, when Prime Minister Koiso succeeded the Tojo cabinet in shouldering the great power, he put forward the slogan of "Great Harmony and Unity" in order to achieve a new heart and soul to complete the war, and established a national total mobilization system to cope with the war situation. Therefore, in the past eight months, he has created the Supreme War Guidance Council, and more recently implemented a new political system, stipulating that the Prime Minister may attend Imperial Headquarters meetings, so that military districts and local councils are closely aligned. These measures are all aimed at closely linking national policy with operations in order to achieve the war's objectives. Now that the internal and external situation is even more important, the need for national unity, the gathering of total strength, and the strengthening of the integration of national policy and the command headquarters are even more urgent. The Suzuki cabinet will resolutely shoulder this important task. As the Asahi Shimbun editorial said on the 6th, "How to integrate command and political affairs is now extremely clear." This is precisely the expectation of the entire Japanese nation for the Suzuki cabinet, and it is also the main central policy of the Suzuki cabinet's administration.

Third, the new cabinet of our ally is a more powerful cabinet of military-official-civilian cooperation, and it is also a decisive battle cabinet for the whole country. This is because its establishment was jointly supported by the Army and Navy, and by General Minami Jiro, the president of the recently established "national party" Greater Japan Political Association, and others. Those who participated in this new cabinet are all daring and promising figures in the Japanese government and society. Following the Army and Navy Ministers Anami and Yonai, figures such as Hirose Kurahe, Minister of Munitions and Transportation Toyoda, and Minister of State and Director of the Information Bureau Shimomura, in particular, are deeply loved by the people and have long been known for their virtue and prestige. The Mainichi Shimbun editorial on the 6th pointed out that "The 100 million people of the nation wish the General to handle national affairs with all his strength, defeat the enemy, and complete the holy war." The Yomiuri Shimbun editorial on the same day also pointed out that "On this day of unfolding the decisive battle in the homeland, it is truly the eager expectation of our 100 million people that General Suzuki will come out to handle matters." From this, we can see the trend of the hearts of the entire nation of our ally. Therefore, we can assert that the new cabinet established by our ally this time will surely be able to better realize the slogans of "Great Harmony and Unity" and "100 Million as One," gather the total strength of the entire nation, and adapt to the new internal and external situation.

The establishment of this new cabinet in Japan cannot help but make us feel more strongly the importance of the tasks of all parties in our country. Chairman Chen of the National Government said in a speech on the 7th: "I firmly believe that the new cabinet will be able to promote the policies of the state with a stronger lineup and carry out the decisive battle. Based on its goal of seeking liberation, the National Government will, in accordance with Dr. Sun Yat-sen's legacy, with the determination to live and die together, implement the initial intention of participating in the war, strive forward, and contribute to the completion of the Greater East Asia War." We must firmly adhere to our beliefs, not be swayed by rumors and fluctuations, and establish closer ties with the new cabinet of our ally, and work together to strive for the victory of the Great East Asia War.

### Proclamation of War by the National Government

On December 8th of the year before last, at the beginning of the Greater East Asia War, the National Government, in accordance with the spirit of the Basic Treaty of Relations between China and Japan, declared its determination to share weal and woe with its friendly nation, Japan. Since then, it has embarked on the New National Movement, engaged in safeguarding public order, and improving the people's livelihood, with the aim of enhancing national strength and assisting in the completion of the Greater East Asia War. However, England, America, and others continue to employ their century-old policy of dividing East Asia, and have intensified it, even enticing elements from Chongqing to participate in the so-called Anglo-American front, sending troops to Burma and India to have East Asians kill East Asians. Recently, as their violent forces have been successively defeated by the land, sea, and air forces of friendly nation Japan, and their bases for aggression in East Asia have been lost, they have become even more cunning. They are also resentful of the peaceful development in the areas governed by the National Government, instigating elements from Chongqing to constantly harass and obstruct the progress of various constructions, and directly using their own aircraft, based in Chongqing, to repeatedly bomb Wuhan, Guangzhou, and other places, harming civilians. The Chongqing elements, willing to be driven by England and America and acting as traitors to East Asia, are certainly shameful; but England and America, with their long-standing preoccupation with East Asia, exhaust their ability to sow discord in order to fulfill their ultimate ambition of annexation, which should be met with common hatred and indignation by the nations of East Asia. The National Government hereby declares that from today onwards, it is in a state of war with England and America, and will devote all its strength to cooperate with friendly nation Japan to sweep away the barbarity of England and America, in order to seek the revival of China and the liberation of East Asia. The two countries, Manchuria and Thailand, have long maintained friendly relations and share a common understanding of the Greater East Asia Co-prosperity Sphere. In the future, they should further enhance cooperation in order to jointly build a new East Asian order based on morality. The friendly nations of Germany and Italy have been engaged in a struggle with the forces of England and America in the West for several years and have repeatedly achieved glorious victories. Our country, now participating in the Greater East Asia War, should echo their efforts in order to contribute to a just new order for the entire world. All our citizens should understand that this is the only opportunity to realize the Father of the Nation’s Pan-Asianism. The revival of the Republic of China, the realization of the Greater East Asia Co-prosperity Sphere, and the attainment of justice and peace for the entire world all depend on this; they should be of one heart and one mind, striving from beginning to end, to carry out this great mission of this great era. January 9th, the thirty-second year of the Republic of China. Chairman Wang Zhaoming.

### On the Conference of International Organizations and Chongqing

— Tadahisa Matsudaira

The United Nations' plan to convene a conference on peacekeeping organizations on April 25th was long anticipated. However, the decision at the Crimea Conference regarding the location and timing of the conference, believed to be Roosevelt's proposal, with England and the Soviet Union merely following his lead, is not difficult to imagine. We speculate that the reasons why the United States chose this time and place are firstly, to boast of its leadership position, and secondly, to politically pressure Japan. The truth of this has been criticized by Information Minister Kishi in his writings. The central issue of this conference is the "Proposal for a General International Organization for the Post-War Period" decided upon during the Dumbarton Oaks talks. According to a Reuters dispatch from Washington on October 10th last year, after the conclusion of the talks: The decisions made at Dumbarton Oaks have been submitted by the US government to the United Nations, to be presented for discussion at a future formal plenary session of the UN, and a charter for the international organization is planned to be drafted. However, with all the undecided matters from the Dumbarton Oaks talks decided through political resolution by the leaders of England, America, and the Soviet Union, before convening an international conference, the calling of this conference was long expected. Therefore, to understand the inside story of the San Francisco Conference, it is necessary to first review the decisions made at Dumbarton Oaks. At the same time, to understand how this conference will affect the nations of East Asia, it is necessary to understand how England and America are dealing with Chongqing. The following is a explanation based on recent data:

The Beginning and End of the Dumbarton Oaks Talks

The war aims of the Axis powers in this war are: for Germany, to break the unreasonable and unfair Versailles system and build a new order in Europe; for Japan, to liberate the nations of East Asia from the control of England, America, and the Netherlands, in order to complete the independence of each nation and build a new order in East Asia. Conversely, England and America do not express their true war aims to the world. Although the Atlantic Charter elucidates the Anglo-American policy towards world politics, its main content focuses on respecting liberalism. However, the actions of England and America run contrary to the Charter, and countries around the world view the Atlantic Charter as an expression of Anglo-American egoism. Therefore, England and America keenly felt the need to immediately create a world policy that would be accepted by the people of the world, on the one hand embellishing their war aims, and on the other hand inducing other countries to oppose Japan's Greater East Asia policy. They then mobilized domestic and international law scholars and sponsored organizations to study international political organizations.

The United States was most enthusiastic about this research, and by the end of May of last year, a plan had been finalized, which was then sent to England, the Soviet Union, and Chongqing. In late August, England, America, the Soviet Union, and England, America, and Chongqing held informal talks. On October 9th, a "Proposal for a General International Organization for the Post-War Period" was drafted. It is not difficult to imagine why the United States showed such great enthusiasm for this research and took the initiative to promote it. The war aims of the United States are unclear. During the last war, Wilson was unable to join the League of Nations due to opposition from Congress, exposing the lack of unity at home. Therefore, this time, it must not repeat the same mistake and must seek proper domestic measures.

Characteristics of the Talks

These talks were not held with representatives from England, America, the Soviet Union, and Chongqing gathered in one place, but rather, based on the Soviet Union's wishes, the three representatives from England, America, and the Soviet Union first discussed and reached an agreement. Then, England and America, based on this agreement, held talks with the representatives from Chongqing, deliberated on Chongqing's intentions, and made a decision. Chongqing was merely an uninvited guest.

It was expected at the time that the talks between England, America, and the Soviet Union would be concluded in two or three weeks. However, the Soviet Union, due to insufficient preparation, requested a postponement, and as a result, the talks were postponed by one week and opened on August 21st. Moreover, differences of opinion arose between England, America, and the Soviet Union. The Soviet representative, Gromyko, had to request instructions from his government on every matter, so the talks progressed very slowly. After six weeks, opinions gradually became aligned.

However, in the talks between England, America, and Chongqing, although Chongqing had proposals, they were all opposed by England and America. The talks lasted only ten days and were hastily concluded.

According to Hull, the nature of these talks was informal. The issues discussed did not include politics, economics, or military affairs. It is difficult to judge whether the representatives of various countries will accept this agreement without consideration when the San Francisco Conference is convened in the future, or whether there will be endless debate. The French de Gaulle government is still hesitant, also fearing that this plan will actually restrict the freedom of all countries. Whether England and America will accept the French amendment proposal is uncertain. If not, then France will definitely not participate, which will have a significant impact on the fate of the small countries.

Content of the Decisions Made at the Talks

According to the announcement on October 9th of last year, the content of the decisions made at the Dumbarton Oaks talks consists of a total of twelve chapters. Later, based on fragmented information, the details of each chapter were also clarified. The outline is listed as follows: Chapter 1: Purposes; Chapter 2: Principles; Chapter 3: Member States; Chapter 4: Principal Organs; Chapter 5: General Assembly; Chapter 6: Security Council; Chapter 7: International Court of Justice; Chapter 8: Measures to Prevent and Suppress Aggression for the Maintenance of International Peace and Security; Chapter 9: Arrangements for International Economic and Social Cooperation; Chapter 10: Secretariat; Chapter 11: Amendment Procedures; Chapter 12: Transitional Arrangements.

The name of this international organization was decided to be "United Nations," but what differs in substance from the League of Nations is: The authority of the United Nations Security Council to ensure security is stronger than that of the League of Nations Council, and the authority of the permanent members of the Council (major powers) is even greater, so the authority of the General Assembly is greatly reduced. A Military Committee and an International Air Force are established to prevent or suppress aggression. In addition, no special troops are established, and the troops of the permanent members of the Council are responsible for preventing or suppressing aggression. Small countries are also members of the General Assembly in form based on the principle of equal sovereignty, but compared to the League of Nations, they actually have no power.

Secondly, what had not yet been decided at the end of the talks was the voting rights of the Security Council. Opinions on general principles seemed to be consistent among all countries, namely that all decisions must be agreed upon by all members of the Council. However, when one of the members of the Council becomes a party to a dispute, the party to the dispute cannot participate in the vote (advocated by England, America, and Chongqing), or can still participate in the vote (advocated by the Soviet Union). This issue may seem to be merely a procedural issue on the surface, but it is actually a major political issue. As a result, the Soviet Union suspects that the United Nations may become a medium for organizing an anti-Soviet crusade, so it stubbornly adheres to its preconceived notions. On the other hand, England and America suspect that the Soviet Union is promoting a strong policy in various parts of the world, whether it is creating a fait accompli, so they consistently insist on the right to decide on aggressor countries. (Please refer to Information Minister Kishi's "Hallucinatory San Francisco Conference.") However, this issue was largely passed in accordance with the Soviet Union's proposals at the Crimea Conference. Therefore, Senator Vandenberg of the US Senate, Pivoley and Harris, members of the British Liberal Party, and Davis, a member of the Labor Party, believe that it is unreasonable for the major powers to be unrestricted by the United Nations while only the small countries are restricted, and they demand that this point be amended. It is expected that the San Francisco Conference will also have considerable problems due to this point.

Chongqing's Attitude Towards the Dumbarton Oaks Talks

Chongqing dispatched Wei Daoming to attend the Dumbarton Oaks talks, and it seems that he also took along independent proposals. Chongqing's proposals differ from other proposals, and what is particularly interesting to us are the following points:

The League of Nations Establishes an International Police Force

In order to prevent aggression, it attempted to establish an international police force directly under the League of Nations, but it was not passed due to opposition from various countries.

Specific Colonies are Under International Administration

An International Committee is established under the League of Nations to place certain colonies under international administration, and in the future, to provide guidance to the residents of the colonies to enable them to develop into autonomous or independent countries. This idea is similar to the mandate system and seems to have an idealistic style. Chongqing intends to adopt this form for the Japanese-occupied areas in Southeast Asia with a large number of overseas Chinese. However, this proposal was also opposed by various countries and rejected.

Establishment of the Principle of Racial Equality

According to a United Press dispatch from Washington on September 15th of last year, the Chongqing representative requested that the principle of racial equality be recognized in the future international organization, but England and America deemed it inappropriate and opposed it. In addition, the United Press dispatch further explained that the principle of racial equality had been discussed at the peace conference of the previous war in 1919 when drafting the Covenant of the League of Nations, and was proposed by Japan. This time, Chongqing made the same proposal and suffered the same fate of being rejected, which is a wonderful coincidence. The Soviet Union, which has long advocated the principle of racial equality, was unable to meet at the Dumbarton Oaks talks, which is also a wonderful coincidence.

Among the above Chongqing proposals, the second and third items represent the ideology of East Asia. In particular, the third item, the principle of racial equality, is consistent with the fifth principle of the Greater East Asia Declaration, which is evidence that Chongqing has not yet lost the ideology of Greater East Asia, which is extremely interesting. It is inevitable that these proposals will be opposed by England and America, but Chongqing must inevitably feel a sense of loss. From this, it can also be proved how subtle Chongqing's voice is.

The San Francisco Conference and the Attitudes of Various Countries

It is said that the San Francisco Conference has issued invitations to 39 countries. It is rumored that the Crimea Conference decided that countries that have not declared war on the Axis powers before March 1st are not qualified to participate in the conference. Therefore, six South American countries immediately declared war. Moreover, recently, Turkey, Egypt, Syria, Lebanon, Iran, etc. have been forced by England and America to hastily declare war on the Axis powers in order to obtain the qualifications to participate in this conference.

The French de Gaulle government was once considered one of the invited countries, but for the above reasons, it refused to participate. After much effort by England and America, it was recently reported that it has agreed to send representatives to attend the conference. The Italian Bonomi government, although created by England and America, decided not to allow it to participate, causing dissatisfaction with the Bonomi government. The most strange thing is that Syria and Lebanon, although they declared war, were not allowed to formally participate. After de Gaulle's mediation, they were only allowed to attend as observers. The resentment in the hearts of these two countries can be imagined.

The Dumbarton Oaks proposal for the League of Nations was not initially sent to Argentina, Switzerland, Sweden, Spain, or Portugal. Argentina was recently forced to declare war and succumbed. Spain was forced to sever diplomatic relations with Japan. The above countries will not participate. In addition, Poland, Afghanistan, etc. have not accepted the invitation and will not attend. Poland, etc. have expressed considerable resentment.

Furthermore, from the intentions of the participating countries, what is noteworthy is that England and America are both making every effort to bring as many accomplices as possible to the conference to increase their power. For example, the United States is accompanied by Latin America and 19 South American countries, as well as Liberia and the Philippines. England has representatives from its affiliated countries, the four European countries of Belgium, the Netherlands, Norway, and Greece, and the five Near Eastern countries of Turkey, Egypt, Arabia, Iran, and Iraq, for a total of 14 representatives. In addition, the Czech Republic and Yugoslavia can also be considered half-friends of England.

On the contrary, the Soviet Union's attitude is completely different. Although the above-mentioned Yugoslavia and the Czech Republic can serve the Soviet Union, it will not bring any accomplices this time. Romania, Bulgaria, and Finland could at least form accomplices of the Soviet Union to participate in the San Francisco Conference, but this is not the case. Whether this is because the Soviet Union is adopting a policy of not engaging in external activities, or whether England and America are taking this opportunity to oppose participation because the borders and political situation of these three countries are unstable, it is difficult to understand. It is generally believed that it was decided in respect of the Soviet Union's opinions that it would not participate this time. It is not difficult to imagine that the Soviet Union requested that representatives from its own Ukraine and Byelorussian Federation be allowed to participate in the conference. England has already recognized this, and the United States, on the condition of reciprocity, has finally accepted it. Therefore, it has now been decided to allow these representatives to attend. From this fact, it can be seen that the Soviet Union intends to create a necessary group of accomplices to attend the conference together, which is quite obvious. In addition, the Soviet Union's mediation for the participation of the Polish Lublin government in the conference was a proposal to create a fait accompli, which was rejected by England and America. Before the conference was convened, the relationship between England and America and the Soviet Union due to the San Francisco Conference was extremely subtle. In addition, the issue that arose between the United States and the Soviet Union was that the United States and the Soviet Union agreed to each send three official representatives to the conference. However, due to opposition from other parties, the United States suddenly changed its policy of sending three representatives on April 2nd, and the Secretary of State announced that it would be changed to one, which caused the Soviet Union to panic.

Chongqing's Position at the San Francisco Conference

Chongqing was not invited to attend the Crimea Conference, but it has always obeyed the decisions made by England, America, and the Soviet Union, so it will send representatives to attend this time. However, Roosevelt had previously requested that the Kuomintang and the Communist Party unite and send representatives. Therefore, with Song Ziwen as the leader, in addition to selecting first-class figures such as Gu Weijun, Wang Chonghui, and Hu Shi, he added Communist Party representative Dong Biwu and representatives from various parties, Zhang Junmai and Li Huang, to avoid the dictatorial color of the Kuomintang.

An understanding has been reached between England, America, and the Soviet Union. England will select official representatives from its colonies such as Canada, Australia, India, and South Africa. The United States and the Soviet Union will each send three official representatives. However, Chongqing has not been granted this qualification. Even if Chongqing has this qualification to send three official representatives, with the Communist Party representative receiving the same treatment as Song Ziwen and Gu Weijun, it is impossible in domestic relations, so its situation is quite difficult. Various countries are appointing figures of the rank of Foreign Minister as representatives, but Chongqing is appointing Song Ziwen, the President of the Executive Yuan, as the head of the delegation, and Gu Weijun, Wang Chonghui, Hu Shi, and Wei Daoming, who are first-class figures in the diplomatic community, as his entourage. Comparing this to the Soviet Union sending only Gromyko, the ambassador to the United States, as the chairman of the delegation, it is like sending adults to attend a children's conference, which gives people a rather strange feeling. So why is Chongqing sending nearly 50 escorts? According to our observation, there are two reasons:

First, Zhu Ziwen has no trusted escorts and is not qualified to send three official representatives, so among his escorts, there are more than three people with experience as Foreign Ministers in order to arrange the prestige.

Second, it is imagined that the Yalta Conference decided on European issues, so this conference must have a resolution on Pacific political issues. Then Chongqing will also share in the benefits, that is, with the ambition of gaining more after achieving a goal, it has specially dispatched a large number of escorts to prepare to individually persuade England, America, and the Soviet Union.

From the Greater East Asia region, only Chongqing and the Osmeña government of the Philippines are participating in the San Francisco Conference. In particular, the latter has not been recognized by any country, and the United States' request to send representatives to attend proves the many forced facts of this conference. These two governments do not represent the entire East Asia, but are only representatives of tens of millions of Asians. Therefore, Chongqing deliberately sent a large number of escorts to show its strength, which is also unknown. Chongqing plans to re-propose the international administration of colonies and the principle of racial equality at the San Francisco Conference, but the United States has already stated that this conference will not discuss the colonial issue and the European border issue. As for the principle of racial equality, it will definitely be opposed by England and America, so it is clear that Chongqing cannot advocate any independent proposals with its current strength. Chongqing intends to use this conference to prevent the threat from the northwest of Asia, so if there are proposals regarding the definition and prevention of aggression, and sympathy for small countries, it will definitely firmly support the opinions in order to seek its own favorable international relations.

In short, Chongqing should realize that cooperation with Japan cannot be successful in the world political arena. Moreover, Chongqing will definitely be aware that this conference and American imperialism are dominated by its own self-interest policies, and the representatives it sends will definitely return disappointed, which can be predicted.

### Sixteenth Air Defense Day Today: Comprehensive Training Implemented; Citizens Should Pay Attention to Various Air Defense Essentials

Today, the 9th, is the 16th Air Defense Day. The Citizens' Air Defense Headquarters, following precedent, will extensively promote the significance of air defense and implement various air defense training exercises. The details are as follows. Citizens are urged to cooperate and implement the training in accordance with the various measures.

Alarm Training

The time for the alarm training has been described in detail in various newspapers the day before yesterday. When the time comes, sirens will not be sounded. However, during the alarm training, if there are actual circumstances that warrant an alarm, sirens will still be sounded. The public should take note. As for the transmission of the alarm, in order to prevent any obstruction, after the issuance and termination of the alarm, the city will uniformly use gongs or other metal objects to replace sirens. The method of striking is as follows:

Pre-air raid warning: Three strikes.

Air raid warning: Random strikes.

Notification of immediate shelter: Also random strikes.

Air raid warning cleared: Three strikes.

Pre-air raid warning cleared: Two strikes again. The striking method will be the same during training. Those in charge must verbally communicate the meaning at any location. There should be a gap of about five to ten seconds between the three strikes and the two strikes for identification.

At the same time, the city will display alarm flags. The method is as follows:

Pre-air raid warning: Blue flag.

Air raid warning: Red flag.

Air raid warning cleared: Blue flag, which must remain until the pre-air raid warning is cleared, at which time the flag will be removed. During training alarms, a small yellow flag will be attached to each colored flag.

Local Training

This is the third local general deployment training, to be implemented by the Huashan and Changmi branch bureaus within their respective jurisdictions. This local training requires all households and all citizens within the jurisdiction to participate in travel training, so that family air defense can be effective in an emergency. Past performance of this training has only involved repeated implementation by participants at the training sites and a limited number of air defense personnel, which is inconsistent with the fundamental spirit of local training. This should be improved. Future implementations should pay attention to the following:

The training area should completely block all traffic.

The situation within each household should be adapted to the specific conditions of that household, perform situational simulations, and mobilize all members of the household to participate in the training.

Each household should prepare emergency water, consider the distance between fire points and water sources, and carry out training in transporting about one load of water to each fire point. After the water is released, there should be no interruption. Immediately change the scenario and take swift action.

Air defense personnel participating in the mobilization should focus on leveraging their mobility. Family air defense must be vigorously promoted, with women, the elderly, and children who stay behind being responsible for family protection.

On the day of the air defense training, avoid non-urgent and unnecessary outings, and ensure that all personnel understand the meaning and duty of participating in the training.

Although uniform air defense clothing is not required, all personnel should wear clothing that is easy to move in. Appropriate warning measures should be taken against those who refuse to wear appropriate clothing.

Those who are unfit to participate in air defense activities must be pre-organized and trained for evacuation.

Unoccupied houses are a source of potential fire spread, so absolutely avoid leaving them unattended.

The Huashan and Changmi branch bureaus should thoroughly inform citizens within their jurisdictions of all relevant points of this training. On the day, Yuyuan Road and Changmi Road will be the boundary, divided into two areas. The northern area will undergo two hours of continuous, intensive comprehensive training from 10:00 AM, and the southern area will undergo two hours of continuous, intensive comprehensive training from 2:00 PM.

Other Training

Traffic Control: At 2:30 PM, when the air raid alarm training is initiated, strict traffic control will be implemented throughout the city. In addition to mobilizing all police officers, the保甲 (bao jia, a local administrative unit) air defense personnel will be summoned to assist. All pedestrians and all vehicles without emergency identification must follow the prescribed procedures to thoroughly implement traffic control, otherwise they will be punished.

Lights Out: At 8:30 PM, when the air raid alarm training is initiated, air raid lights out must be thoroughly implemented. Those who violate this will have their power immediately cut off, and the branch bureau chief will impose a power outage penalty of up to ten days. Those who deliberately violate the blackout should be reported for long-term power outages. Special attention must be paid to the lights of cars, pedicabs, rickshaws, and other vehicles to reduce violations. In the past, the suppression of lights from rooftops and other outdoor lights has been very poor, so any light leakage other than electric lights should be confiscated, and a detention penalty of up to five days should be imposed according to the alarm violation regulations to enhance the implementation of air defense.

At the same time, at 4:00 PM, when the air raid alarm training is initiated, air defense training should be implemented in factories in various districts according to plan, as well as fire extinguishing, shelter, rescue, or other comprehensive training.

### Army Minister Kawamoto Hosts Press

Lieutenant General Kawamoto, Army Minister of the Allied Nations in Shanghai, held a banquet at his official residence on the 7th to host representatives of the city's press and foster relationships. Representing the host were Lieutenant General Kawamoto, the Minister of Information Izushu, Lieutenant Junior Grade Maehara, and trustees Yokota, Sakata, and Koike. Guests included Li Sihao, Chen Bin, Fan Yuanshi, Xu Liqiu, Jin Yaobai, Chen Riping, Guan Feng, Zheng Jie, Yun Yongshu, Jiang Xiaoguang, Zhu Yongkang, Zhao Bi, and more than ten others. Lieutenant General Kawamoto delivered a speech, which was responded to by Zhong Yu on behalf of the press. The banquet concluded around 9:00 PM.

### Central Reserve Bank Issues New 500 Yuan Notes

Starting today, the Central Reserve Bank is issuing new brown 500 yuan notes from the year 32 (Republic of China year 32, 1943). The notes feature a portrait of Sun Yat-sen at the bottom, red serial numbers on the upper left and right, and the seals of the Governor and Deputy Governor Dai Chacheng and Wen Guojun at the bottom left. On the back, the mausoleum of Sun Yat-sen is printed in the center, and the Governor and Deputy Governor's signatures are printed in Western characters on the lower left and right. These brown 500 yuan notes will circulate equally with all other banknotes issued by the bank.

### Yesterday's Police Branch Chiefs Bid Farewell to Director Gojima

After Director Gojima of the Fourth Division of the Municipal Police Bureau transferred to an important position, many groups have held farewell gatherings in recent days. All branch chiefs of the bureau held a farewell tea party at the headquarters' seventh conference room at 9:30 AM yesterday. More than 30 branch chiefs attended, led by Yao Benyuan, head of the Changmi branch, and Li Guohua, head of the Xincheng branch, who gave a farewell speech to Director Gojima. Director Gojima thanked them on the spot. The gathering concluded at around 11:00 AM.

### Germany's Air Raid Countermeasures

Since the great air raid on Hamburg, Germany has had many measures to deal with the scorched city of Berlin. The following will describe food, housing, evacuation, rescue, and finance:

Food

Regarding food, the pre-emptive countermeasures were to reduce the storage of food to a minimum in large cities located in air raid danger zones and to disperse the storage in existing facilities in small surrounding suburban cities. Local food bureaus constantly maintain the amount of food existing in each region. When local food supplies are insufficient during an air raid, the state will make up the difference. If it is still not enough, then other states will assist. Places nationwide are selected, with the standard of one-fifth of the population in air raid danger zones being the target for the food stored in food warehouses. In addition, there is food stored by the National Defense Forces, which can also be used. The organization is quite extensive.

As for post-event countermeasures, after an air raid, the NSV (National Socialist Welfare Organization) distributes one week's worth of rationed food without coupons to needy citizens and workers, and distributes coffee and fine brandy during concerts and in the event of air raid damage to food coupons. Further, a (special air raid ration) is implemented for the general public, especially allocating meat, coffee, and wine once to reward citizens for their heroic efforts. Since the beginning of last year, within Berlin, those who have proof of eligibility for food rations have almost constantly received the same special rations as the military, thereby boosting the morale of the citizens.

As for materials other than food, emergency repair construction materials, repair tools, clothing, and other food warehouses are stored outside the danger zone. If the storage is not sufficient for application, it will be supplied by the Ministry of Economic Affairs' food warehouse. For such distributed storage items to be readily available for application, the soundness of transportation agencies is of the utmost importance. As for post-event countermeasures, the NSV supplies daily necessities such as clothing and tableware without the need for purchase, and distributes other materials in advance. In addition, coal and other fuels are distributed to replace the shortage of gas due to air raids.

Housing

In accordance with the Housing Supply Order, a thorough investigation is carried out on the number of empty houses and the (number of rooms and people) of houses owned by each citizen due to the evacuation of the urban population. This is to supply housing to air raid victims. Evacuated households must hand over their Berlin homes to the NSV for management. The buildings to which the Housing Supply Order applies are generally:

1. Buildings that are not the primary residence.
2. Households with surplus rooms.
3. Those whose purpose of use is not wartime.

Generally, these apply to large mansions with few occupants. The forced evacuation of the urban population follows the principle of returning to their place of origin, implementing group evacuations. The NSV mediates to find them homes. The NSV handles everything, including the transportation of luggage.

In addition, small fire-resistant houses made of reinforced concrete are built on a large scale in the suburbs of the city to provide accommodation for disaster-stricken citizens. Damaged or half-burned houses are fully utilized, repaired, and then used. The municipal authorities are responsible for repairing these houses to make them weatherproof. After an air raid, those whose houses are destroyed will first be temporarily sheltered in designated buildings, and then quickly provided with temporary housing.

Medical Treatment

In addition to buildings such as schools and hotels, (evacuation hospitals) are set up outside air raid danger zones to transport the wounded for treatment. At the same time, hospital basements are strengthened with bulletproof and fireproof equipment. These air-raid shelters can perform any major surgery, even during air raids. In addition, there is an underground hospital successfully built by the Todt Organization, which is the most ideal. This type of hospital with underground bulletproof and fireproof equipment can withstand large bombs, and is unusually sturdy.

As for air raid rescue periods, rescue squads are constantly formed by people who have undergone rescue training. Rescue teams from factories and companies are particularly active. A characteristic of this type of rescue team in Germany is that rescue and first aid are carried out by the same person, so first aid treatment can be given on the spot after rescue.

Finance

During an air raid, banks and postal savings offices continue to handle payment matters as usual. Therefore, banks set up branches or offices in any remote village to handle the payment of deposits. The deposit payment procedure is very simple. If the deposit book is lost or damaged, payment can be made as long as the original record is verified. Dried banknotes can be exchanged for new banknotes as long as they can be identified as banknotes. (Translated from the March 7th edition of the Mainichi Shimbun)

### Western District Self-Defense Brigade Held Review Yesterday

The model self-defense corps in the Huashan Road and Changmi Road保甲 (bao jia) districts in this city officially established a district brigade yesterday (the 8th) morning after being uniformly organized. Chief Gu Jiwu of the保甲 (bao jia) office inspected the brigade. At 9:30 AM, the model self-defense brigades of the two districts gathered on the large lawn of St. John's University on Fanhangdu Road. Chief Gu arrived on time to inspect the brigade. After the inspection, Zhou Shaobai, the chief of the Changmi general联保 (lian bao, a grouping of bao jia), gave a speech reporting on the organization of the model self-defense corps. Chief Gu then gave an encouraging speech. Subsequently, Shen Siliang, the chairman of Changmi, gave a speech. The review concluded at 12:00 noon.

### From Shanghai to Northern Jiangsu

-- Jiaxi

Before the war, there were regular steamships between Shanghai and various ports along the Yangtze River in northern Jiangsu, directly reaching Tianshenggang, Zhanghuanggong, Kou'an, Yangzhou, and other places, making transportation extremely convenient. Currently, transportation tools are scarce, making even a short distance seem like a long way away. Here is a brief description of the recent traffic conditions on this route for the reference of those returning home:

Steamship: China Steamship Company has steamships operating on the Shanghai to Tianshenggang route. One is the "Hana" which can carry 1,200 passengers; another is the "Yuanhe," which can carry 1,000 passengers. They berth at the Bund 6, 7, 12, and the old Taikoo Wharf. The sailing schedule is indefinite and is notified by bulletin. Tickets for 1st, 2nd, and 3rd class are sold at China Steamship Company, No. 4 Beijing Road. Tickets for 4th class are sold at the Lidax company, the agent at Jinliyuan Wharf in Xinzha River. The fares are 9,200 yuan for 1st class, 7,200 yuan for 2nd class, 5,200 yuan for 3rd class, 3,500 yuan for berth, and 2,600 yuan for 4th class. Up to 700 to 800 4th class tickets can be sold. Tickets are sold from 10:00 AM on the day of departure, and the departure time is 2:00 PM. This route is the most convenient, but the sailing schedule is now indefinite, and it is even suspended for many days. Therefore, wooden boat shipping companies have emerged to engage in passenger and cargo transportation between Shanghai and northern Jiangsu. However, they are all in the trial stage, and shortcomings are inevitable. There are many areas that need improvement.

Sailboat: Wufu Company - located at No. 6, Lane 36, Liuhe Road (formerly Lloyd Road), telephone 93854, manager Zhang Jingqing. Currently has seven or eight large sailing boats, directly sailing to Nantong Yaogang and Haimen Jihong. The docking place is by the Suzhou River at the entrance of the Huashang Cloth Exchange warehouse at the west end of Xinzha Bridge. Departure time is 8:00 AM every morning starting from the 10th. The water journey turns from the Suzhou River into the Huangpu River, then turns into the Yangtze River westward, and can reach Yaogang before dark. The smaller boats can accommodate 30 to 40 passengers, and the larger ones can accommodate about 100 passengers. More luggage can be carried. The fare is 8,000 yuan per person, and the water freight for each piece of luggage is within 1,000 yuan. This company is entrusted by the Nantong, Rugao, Chongming, Haimen and Qidong Associations in Shanghai to assist in the evacuation of fellow villagers. Those who are poor and have proof documents from the fellow villagers associations can receive a reduced fare, half charged according to their condition, or completely free of charge.

Highway: Dade United Transportation Company - located at No. 110 Wuding Road, the Central District contact point is Room 114, Continental Hotel, West Xizang Road. The route starts from Shanghai, departs by car, travels through Jiading, Taicang to Changshu. Then drive north to Fushan Port, change to the company's specially prepared small steamboat and drive straight across the river to Yaogang. The main part of this route is all on land, with more checkpoints along the way. It takes about seven or eight hours from Shanghai to Fushan Port, and the river surface from Fushan to Yaogang is more than 30 li, and it takes two or three hours to cross the river. You can still arrive on the same day. The company currently has three rented cars, which depart at 8:00 AM every Wednesday and Saturday. The fare per person is 40,000 yuan, and it is inconvenient to carry large luggage.

Tongda Transportation Commercial Firm - located at No. 524, Zhonghui Building, Dashanghai Road. The company's route is mainly by water, only the section from Shanghai to Wusong uses cars (the car fare is 3,000). From Wusong, take a sailboat to Yaogang. The boat ticket is 1,300 yuan, but passengers need to bring their own food, and can bring two or three pieces of luggage, with an additional luggage fee of about 1,000 yuan per piece. You also need to pay a tip of about 1,000 yuan when you disembark. The journey time from Shanghai to Wusong is about 2 hours, and from Wusong to Yaogang is about 10 hours. Departure starts at 7:00 AM or 8:00 AM, and arrival is around evening.

Civilian Boat: Tonghai Civilian Boat Company - The ticket office is located at Zheng Tai Xiang Ji local goods store, No. 26, Central Market, North Xizang Road. The boat is docked by the Suzhou River in front of the Central Market. It departs every one or two days, heading to Jihong, Laohonggang, Tianshenggang, Qinglonggang and other places. The boat fare is 7,300 yuan per person, plus a tip of 10%. One lunch is provided on board, and another tip of about 1,000 yuan is paid when disembarking. This company is entrusted by the Tonghai Fellow Villagers Association to assist in the evacuation of fellow villagers. Those who have proof documents from the fellow villagers association will have the boat fare reduced appropriately. It is possible to arrive on the same day.

Railway: Another route is the regular route to Yangzhou and other places, that is, take a train from Shanghai to Zhenjiang, and then take a steamboat across the river to Yangzhou or Gaoyou and other places. However, it is not easy to get on the train, and the cost is extremely high, which passengers suffer from.

In the sailing boat routes mentioned above, although there are fewer checkpoints along the way, robbery incidents occasionally occur when sailing on the river. In the future, in addition to strengthening defense capabilities, there is almost no other defense method. In addition, overloading the boat or too many passengers often leads to disaster. Therefore, the management should pay close attention.

### Installation of Water and Electricity Projects Requires Application for Permission, and a Certificate is Issued After Inspection

The Municipal Construction Bureau stipulates that general water and electricity stores installing water and electricity projects must first submit a design of the installation project to the bureau for permission, and then start construction. After completion, they must report to the bureau for inspection. The bureau will send personnel to inspect and issue a certificate of qualification before it is considered reasonable. However, recently, general water and electricity engineering stores have often started construction without reporting to the bureau beforehand. The bureau has determined to rectify this. If there are any water and electricity projects in this city, they must be reported in accordance with the law, otherwise, in addition to being punished according to regulations, a certificate of qualification will be refused.

Registration of Electrical Material Stores

The Municipal Construction Bureau has noted that there are many electrical material stores in the city. In order to unify management, it will conduct registration of these stores in the near future. The second section of the bureau is currently drafting the registration regulations, which will be implemented soon.

### Changmi Police Branch Chief Investigates Extortionist Police Officer

Wang Shuxun, a patrol officer on Changmi Road, had an evil thought when a train was about to arrive at the station during his night patrol the other night around 11:00 PM. He asked his colleague to wait at an intersection several bu (a Chinese unit of length, approx. 5ft) away from the station to intercept a passenger, Yao Henian, who was carrying luggage. The officer stopped him, and when the passenger became nervous, he extorted 5,000 yuan from him and was about to flee. Fortunately, the chief of the branch, Yao Benyuan, was personally inspecting the area and saw him walking alone, which was inconsistent with his patrol route. He interrogated him, and the officer had no choice but to confess the truth. He was immediately taken back to the bureau and detained. It is reported that the case has been reported to the general bureau for dismissal and referral to the prosecutor's office for legal action.

### University Students Held Crime Prevention Speech Contest Yesterday

The (Crime Prevention Speech Contest), sponsored by the Shanghai Student Crime Prevention Research Committee and supported by the Crime Prevention Section of the Third Division of the Municipal Police Bureau, was held at the Great Shanghai Grand Theater yesterday (the 8th) morning at 9:00 AM. More than 1,000 people attended, including Li Shiyu, the director of the Third Division of the Police Bureau, as well as section chiefs, directors, education representatives, and students from universities, middle schools, and vocational schools. Director Li delivered a speech first, explaining the true meaning of crime prevention in detail and expressing his gratitude and appreciation for the university students' enthusiastic research on crime prevention work. He hoped that students would not only study crime prevention theories but also pursue practical work in order to reap benefits. After the speech, the contest began. Zhang Canguang, Liu Shaokui, Dao Chengrang, Wu Xiguang, Zhou Guanghui, and Yang Suishi served as judges. Eleven male and female students participated, including Zhu Shaokun, Hu Zhiyu, Li Xiaoxian, Chen Haijing, Mei Wen, Wu Chuanjia, Pei Guochen, Hu Zhouzeng, Miao Zhengyi, Lin Jiamu, and Xi Yunhang. Each person elaborated on the meaning and methods of crime prevention. As a result, Hu Tongzeng, a top student from Fudan University, won the championship. The topic was (Crime Prevention Work and Juvenile Rehabilitation Education). The runner-up was Pei Guochen, a top female student from the National Shanghai College of Higher Studies. The topic was (Crime Prevention and Life). The third-place winners were Hu Zhiyu, a top student from Shanghai University, with the topic (Modern Metropolis and Crime Prevention Work), and Chen Haipei, a top female student from East China University, with the topic (How to Prevent Child Crime). Director Li then presented the awards. Finally, the crime prevention film (Turning Back is the Shore) was screened. The event ended at around 1:00 PM.

### Drastic Financial Fluctuations in This City Last Week; Prices Still Balanced, Market Conditions Clear

The financial market in this city continued to experience drastic fluctuations in the last week. At the beginning of the week, due to the wait-and-see attitude of the bulls, following the aftershocks of the previous week's rise, retail investors showed some signs of relinquishment, and the market did not show any progress. On Tuesday, powerful forces suddenly sold, and the dumping of空頭 (kong tou, bears) helped, the market sentiment was fatigued, the purchase of government bonds and Chinese stocks suddenly rose, and the market price fell consistently, with a trend of rapidly declining. On Wednesday morning, the market was still sluggish, but in the afternoon, news of bullish developments spread, immediately reversing the upward trend, but most people were unable to confirm the reality, and the expression was slightly daring. This Thursday, the news was confirmed, the public morale was greatly boosted, and investors competed to absorb government bonds and stocks. On Friday, it was even worse, and an unprecedented boom was re-exhibited for two days. On Saturday morning, the market was initially flat, then surged, and finally flattened again. The changes in finance within a week ran in opposite directions with completely different results. Government bonds had fluctuations of over two million yuan, with the highest price reaching over 6.2 million at the beginning. Government bonds also fluctuated between 4,000 yuan and 10,000 yuan. Among Chinese stocks, Yong'an, Meiya, and China Bookstore, the three hottest stocks, fluctuated between 300 yuan and 1,000 yuan. First, more than 30 stocks fell to the limit, and then more than 60 stocks rose to the limit, which shows the intensity of the changes. Although the main cause of this financial change was the international situation, stimulating the activities of speculators in general, the change in the general public's investment target, and the use of the majority of floating funds to invest in gold, government bonds and stocks, was indeed a major cause. Therefore, observing the drastic changes in finance in the past week, the buying and selling of goods in the industrial and commercial sectors has been unusually sluggish. In addition to daily necessities related to people's livelihoods having transactions, other non-essential items can be said to have few inquiries. This can also indicate that the stockpiling of materials is gradually stabilizing, and the people's purchasing power has decreased. Therefore, recent prices have been flat or even low, which shows that the previous rise in prices was indeed due to artificial reasons. It is hoped that the economic authorities will pay close attention to prevent the recurrence of adverse consequences.

### Measures Discussed for Handling Returned Checks

The Joint Reserve Committee of the banking industry in this city had previously formulated four key points as proposed measures for handling returned checks of depositors or clients, and suggested them to the Banking Association. The Association carefully studied them and drafted provisional measures for handling returned checks, submitting them to the Bankers' Association for discussion and active implementation. It is now understood that the Money Exchange Association has also noticed the increasing number of returned checks recently and believes that handling fees should be collected to prevent returned checks, thereby enhancing the credit of each exchange. This matter has been submitted to the Standing Committee meeting for discussion. The proposed draft measures and the four key points suggested by the Joint Reserve Committee and the Banking Association have also been carefully studied, and a draft of measures for handling returned checks will soon be formulated, to be submitted to the meeting for a decision, and actively implemented on a scheduled basis.

### Yongnian Tai Chi Class: Grand Opening of the Second Session

The Yongnian Tai Chi class organized by this office held its second opening ceremony yesterday morning at 10:00 AM in the auditorium of the Chinese Educational Moral Improvement Society on Nantong Road. Over two hundred new and returning students attended, along with guests from various fields, including Ma Gongyu, Tang Zuxiang, Zhou Xiangsheng, and Lu Zunshi, who imparted scriptures.

Ma Gongyu gave a speech, saying that his body was weakest in his youth. Since practicing Tai Chi, he has been at it for ten years. In these ten years, he has neither received injections nor taken medicine, and he writes for twelve hours every day without feeling tired. He is approaching sixty years of age, but people think he looks like he's in his forties, which he attributes to Tai Chi. Those who practice Tai Chi today must acknowledge the Yang family, but they must learn from a genuine lineage to glimpse its essence. This is similar to studying calligraphy, where one must follow Zhong Yao and Wang Xizhi, and have authentic works to emulate, to capture their spirit. Chuan Zhongwen is the grandson of Mr. Yang Chengfu of Yongnian and has personally received instruction from his maternal grandfather since childhood. His family knowledge is profound and extraordinary. In a certain year, Mr. Yang Chengfu was unwell, and he had the chance to meet him and personally witnessed his performance, observing his various techniques, which are beyond the reach of ordinary people. It is rare for everyone to have the opportunity to learn from Master Chuan. Finally, Master Chuan then expounded on the Yang family Tai Chi, in detail. He encouraged the students to be persistent in their practice to achieve success. The meeting adjourned at 12:00 noon. Classes will officially begin today (Monday), and old students are also welcome to rejoin.

### Air Defense Day

Today marks the sixteenth Air Defense Day of the month. Every month on this day, the training work instructed by the Air Defense Headquarters, it is believed that every city resident should be able to understand. We reside in Shanghai, an important base in the rear, and enemy raids are always possible. Whether for oneself or others, to reduce damage, everyone should pay close attention to air defense work.

During raids, special attention should be paid to: 1. When family members evacuate to shelters, one or two people should be left to guard the house to note any fire or robbery incidents. 2. Windows should be opened to reduce damage from vibrations. 3. The enemy sometimes drops objects resembling lipstick or pencils, which contain explosives. They explode upon opening, so do not pick them up if found.

Furthermore, the Baojia personnel responsible for air defense guidance should also lead by example and be conscientious in their duties. In the past, during raid alarms, Baojia youth often    , neglecting their duties and giving the general public a bad impression, which should be avoided.

Currently, during the long period of light control, lights should not be visible from the outside during raid alarms at night. In reality, light shining from the windows of households are seen everywhere, and street vendors illuminate the roads with bright lights, lacking any air defense equipment, while the police and security personnel do not correct them. This should also be addressed.
