### The Japanese are Constructing Strong Fortifications Around the Pasig River Area in Henan Province; Fierce Artillery Battles are Unfolding in Northern Manila

Tokyo, 9th (Central News Agency dispatch) - According to dispatches from Luzon, the defending forces in Manila, since the 3rd, have been ambushing enemy troops invading the city in key areas of the northern districts, inflicting heavy casualties. On the 7th at 1:00 PM, they transferred their positions to behind the Pasig River. Subsequently, they launched fierce attacks on enemy tanks and infantry units advancing in the southern area of the Pasig River, successfully preventing their advance and inflicting heavy damage. Furthermore, in just three days from the 3rd to the 5th, local battles in the northern part of the city alone resulted in over 500 enemy soldiers killed, and several enemy cannons and over 20 armored vehicles destroyed. They are also bravely fighting against enemy troops attempting to invade southern Manila from the Nichols Field airfield. Although the enemy has suffered heavy losses from the Japanese forces' severe attacks, they stubbornly attempt to cut off the main Japanese forces holding the high ground east of Manila, with the aim of severing communication with the Japanese troops within the city. On the evening of the 5th, the enemy gathered an assault force, mainly composed of tanks, in Kosu City, approximately 15 kilometers north of Manila, and adopted a strategy of making a large detour south from eastern Manila. The Japanese forces are currently fiercely attacking the enemy in that area, striving to thwart their southward attempt.

Lisbon, 9th (Central News Agency dispatch) - According to reports from the Luzon front, Japanese forces are constructing strong fortifications in the central southern part of the Pasig River, ambushing American advances. They are also engaged in fierce artillery battles with American forces in northern Manila. On the night of the 5th, a large fire broke out in the most prosperous streets of Manila due to American bombing and artillery fire, lasting for two days and three nights. As a result, Manila's largest department stores, theaters, banks, and hotels were completely reduced to ashes, and half of Chinatown was also destroyed. American military operations seem to have been further hampered by the fire and fierce Japanese counterattacks. At the same time, Japanese forces in the highlands of the Bataan Peninsula are building fortifications in the mountains, engaging in intense jungle warfare with units of the American 38th Division.

Prosperous City Streets Turned into a Sea of Fire

Wandi, Luzon Front, 9th (Central News Agency dispatch) - A portion of the enemy forces that invaded northern Manila on the afternoon of the 3rd had, by the 7th, formed a full-scale offensive against the central and southern areas of Manila. A comprehensive summary of the battle situation in the northern Manila area from the 2nd to the 7th is as follows: The enemy's 1st Cavalry Division, advancing southwest from the Bataan side, reached east of Marcos on the 3rd. On the same evening, a portion of them reached the northern end of Manila City. The enemy used guerrilla cars and armored vehicle teams to bypass gaps in the Japanese defenses, and at around 5:00 PM, broke into the northern part of Manila City, invading the southern reception center of Santo Tomas University. Around 10:00 PM, the Japanese forces defending Manila destroyed the Pasig River bridgehead and some military facilities according to plan. On the same day, the enemy also broke into the vicinity of Santo Tomas University late at night. Moreover, security within the city is excellent, and public order has been restored very quickly. Since the evening of the 4th, the enemy's 1st Cavalry Division and the 37th Infantry Regiment, together with Philippine bandits, have invaded the northern side of Manila City. The enemy force originally had 170 tanks, 500 cars, and four artillery pieces, with other vehicles totaling approximately 1,500 and personnel exceeding 1,300. In response, the Japanese army and navy, in mutual cooperation, have been engaging in fierce street battles in the eastern and northern parts of the city for days, with the area between the Central Station and Malacañang Palace being the most intense. During the three days and nights, Japanese commando units broke into the enemy-held Presidential Palace, destroying two enemy tanks and killing over 50 enemy soldiers. During the street battles, the enemy used incendiary bombs, and the most prosperous Rizal Avenue and Escolta Street areas of Manila were surrounded by raging fires for days. The Japanese forces bravely fought to the death, holding their positions amidst the fierce fires, inflicting great damage on the enemy. Therefore, the battle within Manila City continues between the two armies in the area north of the Pasig River, while important areas of Manila on the southern island are still secured by the Japanese garrison. Since the 6th, the Japanese forces have been shelling the southern island area, and at the same time, a portion of the enemy forces and bandits attacked Nichols Field airfield on the southern outskirts of Manila. The Japanese forces in that area seem to have continued to pressure the enemy forces to the south on the 6th. Because the enemy forces have recently gathered two or three divisions of troops in the surrounding areas of Manila, attempting to launch a full-scale attack, the street fighting within Manila City may become even more intense. Currently, the Japanese forces are inflicting great damage on the enemy and fighting bravely.

The Decisive Battle Has Only Just Begun

Lisbon, 9th (Central News Agency dispatch) - The enemy Americans are making a big publicity push based on the invasion of Manila, implying that the Philippine campaign is about to end. However, the Japanese forces are still deploying tightly on Luzon Island, so the real decisive battle is yet to come. Even the American leaders fabricating the propaganda must frankly admit this. Former American Resident Commissioner to the Philippines, McNutt, broadcast that even if Manila is occupied, strong Japanese forces are still deployed on Luzon Island. Unless these Japanese forces are defeated, it cannot be considered that the Philippine campaign has ended. Furthermore, former Ambassador to Japan and current Under Secretary of State, Grew, stated that the fall of Manila can only be considered the beginning of the Japanese-American decisive battle. It would be a big mistake to think that this means the end of the Philippine campaign.

The Japanese Military's Potential Should Not Be Underestimated

Lisbon, 9th (Central News Agency dispatch) - According to a dispatch from Detroit, US Under Secretary of the Navy, Forrestal, gave a speech in Detroit on the 7th, saying that although the US military has made progress in several places in the Pacific today, the Japanese military still has powerful forces and well-equipped elite troops. Moreover, the production of Japanese aircraft and weaponry is gradually increasing, and the Japanese military also has a large number of reserve forces. They all have the determination to fight the US military and win. Frankly speaking, the current war situation can only be said to be the beginning of the US military's formal test of the Japanese military's defense capabilities. The closer we get to Tokyo, the more fortified the defenses of the Japanese army and navy will be. In the Philippine Islands, the Japanese military has built many airfields in the past two or three years. The US military has suffered considerable losses in past air battles, and its losses will inevitably increase as it advances into the Pacific in the future. We must now pay attention to the possibility that the Japanese military will use rocket bombs and jet-propelled aircraft.

### Minister Matsushima Discusses the Japanese Military's New Strategy: The Japan Navy Becomes an Air Force

The joint press conference hosted by the three authorities of the Allied Japan Army, Navy, and Foreign Affairs in Shanghai was held yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM at the Cathay Hotel on Nanjing Road. Minister Matsushima of the Fleet Press Department, Lieutenant Matsumoto, Trustee Lin Junfu, Wang Bingnan, Liu Zhennan, Minister Matsudaira of the Shanghai Office of the Embassy, Vice Consul Fukuoka, etc. were present. Minister Matsushima delivered a speech clarifying the evolution of the Philippine battle situation. In the operations on the Philippine Islands, the Japanese military adopted a new strategy, giving the enemy Americans the greatest attrition and annihilating them, as well as various difficulties suffered by the enemy Americans in terms of manpower and supply in the Pacific. The speech is recorded as follows:

Japanese Military Operations Cause Enemy Attrition

Regarding the situation in the Philippines, fierce street fighting is currently underway in Manila. The Japanese military has consistently inflicted the greatest sacrifices and the greatest attrition on the enemy forces. Although the enemy American commander, MacArthur, announced that Manila has fallen and that Luzon Island is under his control, the whereabouts of the Japanese military units led by General Yamashita and the naval units led by General Okawauchi are a matter of operational secrecy and cannot be disclosed to the enemy. The Japanese operational method is to avoid a major decisive battle and instead cause the enemy Americans to suffer large-scale attrition, and within the realm of possibility, to lure the American forces to gather in the Luzon Island area and annihilate them. In order to prepare for combat capabilities, they obstruct the enemy's offensive. Therefore, Generals Yamashita and Okawauchi have deployed their tactics. In the past, in the Leyte Island area, they tied down at least ten enemy divisions. The American forces currently tied down in the Manila area are several times greater than those in Leyte Island.

Great Battle Results are About to Appear

Even if Luzon Island falls, because of the Japanese military's change in operational methods, the losses suffered by Luzon will be extremely limited. The significance of the Japanese protection of Luzon Island lies in maintaining the supply routes to the Japanese mainland and the south. If Luzon Island falls, it may appear that the supply from the south to Japan will be affected, but now the Japanese military is changing its strategy, abandoning the past strategy of protecting Luzon to maintain resources from the south and adopting a new strategy. The so-called new strategy will make aircraft the primary focus, annihilating the enemy on the unique terrain of the Japanese mainland and the Chinese mainland, and on an extremely narrow and flooded sea. Especially in terms of Sino-Japanese cooperation, this strategy is of great significance. The most prominent phenomenon of making aircraft the primary focus is the Japan Navy becoming an Air Force. Since the advent of aircraft more than thirty years ago, Japan has regarded warships as the main force and aircraft as the auxiliary force. In the past operations in Malaya and Hawaii, the heavy damage inflicted on the enemy was due to this allocation. Now that Japan is adopting a new strategy and using aircraft as the main force, it is not because of a lack of warships or because the power of warships is not as good as the power of aircraft. This has been demonstrated in the Hawaii battle, and can be clearly stated. Now that the operational method has changed, in future major naval and air operations, the situation of fleets being dispatched as in the past will not be easily realized unless absolutely necessary. At this moment, before the power of the Japanese air force has surfaced and the extreme effects have appeared, all kinds of situations are temporarily suspended. I believe that astonishing effects will soon be demonstrated.

The Enemy Americans Are Feeling Even Greater Difficulties with Manpower

Secondly, the weakness of the American military is the lack of human resources. In the Leyte Island operation, twenty American divisions were tied down. In the future, on the mainland or in areas close to the Japanese mainland, the United States will certainly feel even greater difficulties with human resources. The second is the problem of replenishing weapons and fuel. Because the transportation route is too long, like the same situation after the Allied German forces attacked Stalingrad, the enemy Americans will soon encounter extreme difficulties in this regard.

The Enemy's Schemes Take Advantage of the Opportunity to Spread Rumors

Recently, many rumors have sprung up in Shanghai. Recently, when someone saw Japanese soldiers wearing leather hats, they took the opportunity to spread rumors. This is just a troop movement. In such a vast China, what is so strange about moving troops wearing leather hats from the north? There is also an incredible rumor that in order to protect the safety of Shanghai, it is hoped that the Japanese troops in Shanghai will withdraw, making Shanghai a demilitarized city. This is a temptation from the enemy and communist party tactics. If we take the view of Sino-Japanese cooperation, shared life, and shared death, this kind of rumor will never occur. Japanese, whether officers or civilians, are fighting together, willing to be completely annihilated if necessary, in order to prevent the British and Americans from invading China. If Chinese intellectuals can understand the psychology of the Japanese, then this kind of rumor will naturally disappear. In the Greater East Asia War, Japan is not focused on local victories or defeats. Its greatest policy is to protect the safety of the Japanese mainland and the Chinese mainland, and to make the enemy Americans bleed and lose as much as possible.

### B-29 Enemy Aircraft Indiscriminately Bomb Saigon; French and Vietnamese People Express Anger

Saigon, 9th (Central News Agency dispatch) - On the 7th, B-29 aircraft indiscriminately bombed Saigon, causing considerable damage to buildings and civilian houses, as well as many casualties. According to the local French government authorities, they announced at 7:00 PM that afternoon that American heavy bombers had invaded the Saigon riverside area at noon on the 7th, causing damage to hospitals and residences. Because this was indiscriminate bombing of the residential center of the city, the French and local residents were greatly affected. The enemy has repeatedly claimed that it will not kill French and Annamese people, but now its brutal face has been completely revealed. In particular, many people in hospitals were sacrificed due to indiscriminate bombing. French military officers and civilians have expressed extreme anger at this inhumane behavior.

### Two Enemy Submarines Sunk in the Pacific

Southwest Pacific Base, 6th (Central News Agency dispatch) - Japanese air units have sunk two enemy submarines in the Southwest Pacific in the past few days.

Editorial

### Prospects for the Battle of Manila

With Manila as the center, the Philippine war has become more intense in the past few days.

When the enemy Americans landed in the Lingayen area last time, they intended to capture Manila in one fell swoop within a week or ten days. However, due to the fierce resistance of the powerful Japanese military using attrition tactics, the enemy suffered heavy losses and ultimately failed to achieve their wish.

From the end of January to the beginning of February, the enemy's offensive intensified. At the same time, the Japanese military strategically withdrew slightly in some areas after completing its strategic mission, and the war began to approach Manila. The enemy Americans are adopting a semi-circular offensive against Manila. The main force crossed the central plain of Luzon from Lingayen, went south through the San Fernando area, and attacked north of Manila. In the southwest, they attacked from Subic Bay northwest of Manila and north from the Bataan Peninsula southeast of Manila Bay, echoing the southward force. On February 3, American troops advancing south from San Fernando first broke into the northern area of Manila and launched fierce battles.

It is estimated that the enemy American forces invading Luzon Island and attacking Manila currently amount to more than eleven divisions. About eight of these divisions came from Lingayen Bay in succession, about two divisions newly landed from Subic Bay northwest of Manila at the end of January, and another part belonged to the troops landing at Nasugbu southwest of Manila Bay. The distribution of these forces is roughly two divisions each in Lingayen and the highlands northeast of Clark Field, two divisions in the Manila area, two divisions in the Subic area, and two divisions in the Nasugbu area, concentrated in the west-central-south parts of Luzon Island, forming the so-called semi-circular offensive against Manila.

Outside Luzon Island, the Japanese military in Leyte and other islands still maintains powerful combat forces. In order to contain the Japanese military, the enemy Americans have also been conducting invasive operations against the central and southern islands of the Philippines recently. From mid-January, the enemy forces also carried out landing operations in the southern Sulu Islands (northeast of North Borneo). They have also been constantly harassing the waters around Cebu Island in the central part. There have also been landings on Bohol Island between Leyte Island and Cebu Island, all of which have suffered heavy blows from the Japanese military's counterattacks. Furthermore, in the Palembang area of Sumatra, enemy British mobile units have recently invaded from time to time in response to the enemy American operations in the Philippines, but after the Japanese military's counterattacks, the enemy British have suffered losses and gained nothing.

The reason why the enemy Americans are so urgently trying to capture Manila is because they have their own wishful thinking.

First, the enemy Americans are attempting, and subjectively believe, that after occupying Manila, they can settle Luzon Island and thereby resolve the Philippine war. In fact, there are still a large number of elite Japanese troops scattered throughout the Philippine Islands. Given the large number of Philippine islands and the complexity of the terrain, it is extremely difficult for the enemy Americans to rest easy on the Philippine Islands. Moreover, Manila currently has little strategic value, and the gain or loss of this place is of little importance.

Second, the enemy Americans also plan that after making progress in the Philippines, they will use the islands of Luzon as bases, establish air force bases and naval supply stations, and then harass Taiwan and the Chinese coast, and expand their air guerrilla warfare, including the Japanese mainland. This plan is also bound to fail. On the one hand, as mentioned above, the Japanese military on the Philippine Islands can still contain them in the future. On the other hand, the powerful Japanese naval forces, which do not move easily, are waiting to annihilate the enemy. If the enemy Americans advance further, they will undoubtedly suffer even more severe blows than they suffered in the Taiwan Sea in the past. Moreover, since the Yuehan Railway has been opened and the defense of the Chinese coast has been strengthened, the enemy American's delusion of landing is obviously more hindered.

Third, the enemy Americans also want to occupy Manila as the basis for their propaganda offensive. Manila is the capital of the Philippines (the Philippine government has now moved its capital to northern Luzon Island). By occupying Manila, they want to create the distorted impression in the minds of the general public that the United States has conquered the Philippines, and use this to engage in various propaganda with delusional grandiosity. This is also futile. As long as the Japanese military can still stand and operate on the islands, this propaganda will be ineffective.

In short, the gain or loss of Manila in one place will definitely not immediately determine the Philippine war, let alone affect the entire Greater East Asia War situation. However, we cannot ignore the seriousness of the situation, and we must respond to the severe situation more carefully, and cooperate more actively in the war, overcome difficulties, destroy all the delusions of the enemy Americans, and regain the freedom of the East Asian people and the freedom of the Chinese nation.

### The Japanese Military Wins Victories Near Bhamo, Burma; Enemy Aircraft Attacking the Nankan Bridge Shot Down Eight Aircraft

Northern Burma Front, 9th (Central News Agency dispatch) - The newly formed 22nd Division and part of the 50th Division of the 6th Army of the Nationalist Chinese Army, which are gradually moving south along the Mengduo Highway near the Bhamo area, have been fiercely attacked by the Japanese garrison in Bhamo, suffering devastating blows, losing contact with the 6th Army, and falling into complete chaos, forcing them to suspend their actions. Until recently, when they independently advanced south again, several hundred Nationalist Chinese troops attacked near Menglong (25 kilometers north of Mengmit) at dawn on January 28. After two successive courageous assaults by the Japanese military, they were routed, abandoning many corpses and prisoners. Also on that day, in the evening, several hundred Nationalist Chinese troops with many mortars and machine guns on a hill 200 meters east of Menglong launched an offensive against the Japanese front lines, but suffered heavy losses and retreated north.

Japanese Military Base on the Burmese Front, 9th (Central News Agency dispatch) - In response to the attacks from Ruili and Namhkam, the enemy air force has repeatedly spied on the rear of the Japanese military. On the 29th, a total of 38 enemy aircraft attacked the Nankan Bridge (34 kilometers northwest of the provincial capital) on the Burma Road between Lashio and Ruili, bombing or strafing it. After the Japanese military's air defense units in that area shot down eight of them and inflicted some damage, they fled.

### Solid Alcoholic Beverages Successfully Manufactured

Tokyo, 9th (Central News Agency dispatch) - The Great Japan Beer Science Research Institute, which had long been inconvenienced by the transportation of liquid alcoholic beverages such as beer, whiskey, and sake, has been researching the solidification of alcoholic beverages. It has recently achieved success, meaning that the whiskey, beer, etc. that were previously consumed can now be transformed into edible solid food. The production content is roughly as follows: (1) "Solid Alcohol": This is a solid alcohol successfully produced by the Osaka Factory. It is made by adding succinic acid to glucose, which becomes edible Japanese sake and whiskey. It is extremely convenient to send to the front lines, and the taste is extremely sweet, making it especially suitable for aircrew and submariners. (2) "Instant Beer Essence": This beer essence is sent to the battlefield, where it is dissolved locally to become liquid beer essence, with the aim of allowing the soldiers on the front lines to satisfy their desire for alcohol. The essence is made using sugar water pulp and hops, with a small amount of yeast added. Shaped like small milk candy cubes, these beer essence cubes are dissolved in carbonated water to become beer, which can be freely used within 24 hours. This was successfully manufactured by the Tokyo Factory.

### Nelson Manipulates Nationalist Chinese Military Supplies Production

(Central News Agency, Shanghai News) According to a youth who arrived here from Chongqing, the United States sent Nelson to promote Nationalist Chinese military supplies production in August of last year. After the establishment of the Military Supplies Production Bureau, new factories were established in Chongqing, Kunming, Chengdu, and other northwest areas. Nelson sent Americans to serve as consultants in these factories, numbering as many as 34. As a result, the factories were all manipulated by Americans. Even Weng Wenhao, the director of the wartime production bureau, was only in name. In reality, he was controlled by the American consultants, which Chiang Kai-shek was extremely dissatisfied with. Recently, the highway from India to Chongqing has been opened. In order to grasp the actual power of the highway, Chongqing intended to name it "Chiang Kai-shek Highway", but the United States opposed it, naming it "Stilwell Road". After repeated discussions, it was decided to name it "Stilwell Road", and the director of the management bureau was also an American. The Chongqing authorities showed no objection on the surface, but were actually not very satisfied. As a result, the United States only sent black people to work on the highway for transportation.

### Reduced US Production

Central News Agency, Shanghai. According to reliable sources, the wartime boom in the United States has deteriorated since October of last year, and the production of military supplies has also gradually decreased. Statistics show that in November of last year, its military production had already decreased to 60%. Although the Washington authorities have since tried their best to restore production, up to now, not only has it not been realized, but various defects have occurred in social life. According to recent news: the shortage of coal and food in the United States is extremely serious. On January 26 of this year, the Washington authorities ordered the rationing of coal to all public places in the country to be stopped in thirty-nine states (the rationing of coal to the people had already stopped). On February 1, they again ordered a 50% reduction in all electricity consumption. The next day, they stopped the use of railways to transport civilian supplies for four days in five eastern states, including New York, Pennsylvania, and Ohio. In New York, passenger car operations were also stopped, and at the same time, strict administrative measures were announced to prevent public riots. According to the explanation of the government authorities, this panic is entirely due to the shortage of coal and manpower in the country. It is said that the production of coal in the United States has been reduced by 10 million tons per month since December of last year, and the labor force in military factories has also decreased by 700,000 people, resulting in the above-mentioned results. It is also learned that the production of US military supplies is now greatly reduced compared to before, especially in the production of weapons such as airplanes, tanks, rubber tires, and meteor bombs, which are particularly hindered.

### Special Compilation of Survey by the Statistics Bureau of the Economic Commission

Central News Agency, Nanjing, 9th. Since its establishment last year, the Statistics Bureau of the National Economic Commission has launched a general survey of the economic situation. The Bureau plans to compile a special publication in the near future on the various survey statistics obtained over the years, for the reference of all relevant parties, and is now actively compiling it.

### Minister of the Navy Ling Hai Published His Views on the Current War Situation: The Enemy's American Invasion is a Major Strategic Error

The newly appointed Minister of the Navy, Mr. Ling, came to Shanghai from Beijing the day before yesterday on official business and is scheduled to stay in Shanghai for several days to pay his first visits to various sectors of the city after taking office and to inspect the various Shanghai-based agencies of the Ministry of the Navy. A Central News Agency reporter specially visited Minister Ling at his private residence yesterday to inquire about his views on the current war situation and the general situation of the Chinese Navy. The following is a transcript of his remarks:

Modern Warfare: Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the brave soldiers of friendly nations have resisted the enemy for three years, and their brilliant achievements have amazed people all over the world. This spirit of serving the country with loyalty, perseverance, and excellence is truly admirable. The enemy, Britain and the United States, have suffered heavy losses after this long-term attack and cannot recover without several years of preparation. Moreover, the military supplies needed at present are becoming increasingly scarce, and the difficulties in their supply and the reduction in production are enough to make them exhausted in coping with the war. Now the enemy is taking a great strategic taboo, trekking long distances across the ocean, and deeply invading the hinterland of East Asia, which is a major mistake. Moreover, the current war is not about the gains and losses of a place or a city, but about how to consume the enemy's war power. Therefore, although the Pacific islands have been luckily occupied by them, from a military point of view, they have no significant value. Although Manila has now been invaded by the enemy, the surrounding friendly naval and land forces have adopted an ambush posture to make the enemy bleed heavily, which is the so-called "bleeding tactic." According to my observation, in modern warfare, airplanes are more important than warships. The production of friendly airplanes is increasing day by day, and the naval combat troops have a strong air force, making their formation even stronger. Moreover, the enemy's supply lines are long and distant, while our supply bases are close at hand, which is also an advantageous position for us.

Our Navy: When the National Government returned to the capital, friendly nations returned the coastal bases to our country based on morality and helped cultivate the navy. Over the years, the navy has gone from the embryonic stage to the new stage. The headquarters has actively trained naval personnel in these years. Although the current strength is not enough to directly attack the enemy, with the cooperation of friendly nations, the national naval defense mission has been undertaken by our navy, and all officers and soldiers have the ambition to kill the enemy. In the current situation, when the enemy is exhausted, it is still impossible to invade the country as an isolated army. If the enemy takes risks and turns dreams into reality and invades our coastline, then our well-trained and battle-ready navy will have the opportunity to give the enemy a head-on blow.

Today's Tea Party: Mr. Ling visited Mayor Zhou at 1:00 p.m. yesterday, Commander-in-Chief of the Friendly Naval Fleet in China, General Kondo, Commander of the Shanghai Naval Landing Force, the Naval Attache Office, and the Shanghai Base Headquarters, making his first visits after taking office. He was invited to a banquet by General Kondo in the evening. It is also scheduled to hold a tea party at the Shuijiaoshe at 4:00 p.m. today (10th) to entertain Chinese and foreign guests from all walks of life in the city to enhance friendship.

### Economic Police Authorities Strictly Prohibit Price Gouging of Vegetables; Joint Military and Police Investigation of Rice Price Hike

The economic police authorities of this city believe that recently, as the end of the year approaches, some illegal merchants disregard laws and regulations and take the opportunity to stir up trouble and raise prices, resulting in increasingly rampant inflation and serious threats to people's livelihoods. Therefore, starting on the 7th of this month, all economic police were dispatched to conduct a comprehensive investigation of prices and to detain profiteers. On the 7th, various detachments found in their respective districts that some vegetable vendors were seeking exorbitant profits and had raised vegetable prices wildly, with ordinary vegetables selling for about 1,000 yuan per catty, which was illegal, so they were detained for investigation. A total of 139 vegetable vendors who made exorbitant profits were detained that day and sent to the General Bureau for investigation. Depending on the severity of the case, they were fined 500 to 1,000 yuan, and given detention and reprimand. Among them, 37 were detained, 83 were fined, and 19 were reprimanded. The investigation continues to this day, and illegal vegetable vendors will be detained.

Moreover, the black market for rice prices is becoming increasingly rampant, and the economic police authorities are paying more attention to it. Starting the day before yesterday, they joined forces with the military and police to conduct a thorough investigation in the suburbs such as Caohejing and Zhoujiaqiao. Those who forcibly buy and manipulate the price of illegal rice will be detained and severely punished in accordance with wartime laws.

### Yesterday's Air Defense Day Implementation of Alarm Communication Training, Comprehensive Exercises Held Separately in Each District

Yesterday (9th) was the 14th Air Defense Day. The air defense authorities carried out various air defense training exercises as usual. However, in addition to district training and comprehensive training, this session also carried out alarm communication training without prior notice. The Air Defense Section of the Second Division of the Municipal Police Department dispatched special commissioners to inspect and guide the exercises. The entire day was in a state of air defense, and the atmosphere was very tense. The details are recorded as follows:

Implementation of Alarm Communication Training

The scheduled alarm training started at 8:00 a.m. The alert alarm was issued at 9:00 a.m. The air raid alarm was issued at 10:00 a.m. The alert alarm was issued again at 11:00 a.m. The alert alarm was completely lifted. The designated training alarm was not sounded with a siren. The unscheduled training alarm started at 2:00 p.m., which was the air raid alarm, and was lifted at 2:30 p.m. At 3:30 p.m., the text was changed to training air raid alarm, and at 4:00 p.m., it was practiced entering the training alert alarm, and at 5:00 p.m., the training alert alarm was lifted. From 7:00 p.m. to 9:00 p.m., training alarms were also carried out. This training alarm was not sounded with a siren, nor was it scheduled in advance. It was decided temporarily by the Air Defense Command, which ordered the citizens' air defense headquarters, which then used the quickest method to order the various branches, telephone companies, water and electricity companies, and other transportation agencies to implement various emergency measures. Then, the second section of each branch ordered the Baojia head police and air defense personnel in their respective districts to implement major training exercises such as traffic control and lighting control. The lighting control was the strictest. Each district was formed by police officers and Baojia personnel to form a lighting control team to patrol each district. Those who leaked light and violated the rules were punished by sealing the electricity.

Three Districts Implemented Local Training

This session implemented the second local general staff training, which was jointly implemented by Taishan, Lujiawan, and Changshu districts. The areas under the jurisdiction of the three branches were bounded by Taishan Road. Training was conducted in the northern district from 10:00 a.m. and in the southern district from 11:00 a.m. A small number of citizens and all alarm personnel in the three districts participated, and the heads of the respective branches, Shi Enjian, Yu Dengyun, and Xu Dong, together with the directors of the second section of each branch, served as commanders. At the beginning of the training, it was assumed that a large squadron of enemy planes was attacking and indiscriminately bombing the area. Houses collapsed, and then smoke and flames rose everywhere. Residents and pedestrians fell to the ground injured. Air defense personnel immediately carried out security, firefighting, and rescue work, and directed the public to take refuge. Observers and communicators reported the assumed bombing situation at any time, and the performance was quite realistic. Other districts separately implemented comprehensive training exercises, including 7 in Huangpu District, 9 in Xincheng District, 5 in Laoza District, 3 in Jing'an Temple District, 8 in Jiangning District, 7 in Hongkou District, 2 in West Hongkou District, 6 in North Sichuan Road District, 7 in Tilanqiao District, 2 in Yulin Road District, 2 in Yangshupu District, 18 in Taishan District, 2 in Lujiawan District, 16 in Changshu District, 3 in Huashan Road District, 2 in Changning District, 3 in Yimiao District, 1 in Penglai Road District, 3 in Xieqiao District, 7 in Xujiahui District, 7 in Zhabei District, and 2 in Dongchang Road District. The heads of the respective branches directed the implementation of various major training exercises such as taking refuge, rescue, and fire fighting. The training on taking refuge was the most arbitrary. All shelters were marked with clear signs. During the training, citizens went to the shelters, and the results were very skilled.

Secretary-General Luo Visited the Training

The Xincheng Police Branch specially convened its air defense staff and held a comprehensive training exercise near Jiading Road and Xinzha Road at 8:00 a.m. Those who came to inspect the site included Secretary-General Luo, representing Director Zhou, Deputy Director Du, and the head of the Husi Gendarmerie of the friendly nation. Branch Director Li Guohua personally came to the site to command. After the inspection, Secretary-General Luo gave instructions and expressed satisfaction with the air defense training in the district. Later, Branch Director Li gave a speech, in addition to encouraging the members, he also pointed out the various shortcomings. It is heard that the results of this training were very satisfactory.

### The Deadline for the 18th Phase of Household Sugar is Postponed

The 18th phase of household sugar has been distributed since the 3rd of this month and was originally scheduled to end yesterday (9th). Due to the inability to complete the distribution and sale within the prescribed date, the Goods Distribution Office has specially extended it for three days until February 12th. Citizens can still purchase five market taels of white sugar or granulated sugar per certificate with the No. 41 comprehensive distribution certificate, with a selling price of 260 yuan in national currency.

Reader Scholarship News

### Reader Suggestions for Establishing a "Happy New Year Scholarship Assistance Team"

Raise Twenty Thousand Yuan Per Team

Our newspaper received a letter yesterday from Mr. Ying Yongyu, stating: "Your newspaper's 'Special Fundraising' to rescue students from dropping out has received much attention from readers, who hope it will exceed its target, so that young students will not have to abandon their studies. I think there is a good opportunity now, or rather, a good method. Please establish a 'Happy New Year Frugality Scholarship Assistance Team' immediately. The reasons and methods are briefly described below: (1) Reasons: The amount of waste during the Lunar New Year is quite staggering. With a city of four million people, if each person spends one hundred yuan, that amounts to four hundred million yuan. Moreover, in the current circumstances of difficult transportation and expensive fares, the money spent on New Year visits, as well as the valuable time, is particularly regrettable. Abolish New Year visits and donate the money saved to scholarship funds. Moreover, in the recent unusually cold weather in our city, this saves time and discomfort from travel, while allowing young people who are about to drop out to continue their studies. Furthermore, their names will be listed in the newspaper, known to all friends and relatives, which can replace New Year cards and door-to-door visits. (2) Methods: From the first to the tenth day of the lunar calendar, the Shen Bao will establish a 'Happy New Year Frugality Scholarship Assistance Team.' Anyone who donates between one thousand and ten thousand yuan to the scholarship fund can form a team. Their names will be published in a special column every day. The target is ten thousand teams, totaling at least twenty million yuan. Ying Yongyu is donating one thousand yuan to promote and facilitate the success of this endeavor. Please accept it. (Previously published in the Japan column.) It is hoped that various institutions, organizations, companies, industrial and commercial factories, and senior personnel will actively participate in promoting this great cause. The youth will be fortunate, and society will be fortunate!"

(Note) We feel that Mr. Ying's proposed method is very meaningful. However, listing one thousand to ten thousand yuan as a team is inconsistent with the regulations of the "Special Fundraising." It would be more reasonable to raise twenty thousand yuan to form a team. For example, if ten people each donate two thousand yuan and specify that it be included in the "Happy New Year Scholarship Assistance Team," we will combine it to form a team and list the names of the donors afterward. In this way, both parties will find it convenient. And Mr. Ying's suggestion has already had a great effect in practice. Furthermore, our newspaper's principle for raising scholarship funds is to emphasize the free will of all sectors and never to coerce. If someone enthusiastically promotes fundraising and puts it into practice, that is of course even more welcome.

·New Year's Money Coupon· Sales Report

Fierce fighting is underway in the small bridgehead established by the Soviet troops surrounded between Fürstenberg and Küstrin. German forces in the Seelow Heights area have the upper hand. German garrisons in Hynic-Teumer and Posen are still holding their original positions. A strong counter-offensive launched in the Schleich-Alrondalfeld area has been successful, thus completely shattering the Soviet attempt to attack the German defense line in East Prussia.

Berlin, 9th (Central News Agency) - German News Agency: Since Thursday morning, the fighting in the Breslau-Groß Glogau-Liegnitz triangle area has developed into a major battle. Soviet troops launched an offensive from their Wuhle River bridgehead towards Steinau, supported in advance by a large number of motorized units. The Soviet advance to the south is clearly intended to cut off the railway and highway from Liegnitz to Upper Silesia, while simultaneously flanking the German forces defending Breslau. After launching several ineffective offensives, a Soviet armored unit advanced along the Wuhle River and occupied Beitzenweide.

### Alsace: Fierce Fighting

Berlin, 9th (Central News Agency) - Reuter: The anti-Axis forces have not yet begun an offensive in the area between the Meuse and the Eifel. German forces northwest of the Eifel are feeling pressured, and the right flank of the U.S. Ninth Army is also becoming active. The focus of the U.S. First Army's offensive is in the Schleiden area and southwest and west of Prüm, but progress is minimal. The U.S. Third Army attempted to cross the Our and Sauer rivers, but the bridgehead it established on the east bank was cleared by German forces. The situation in Alsace is fierce, and German rear guard units have withdrawn from the Ill area.

### British Dominion Holds Third Conference

Stockholm, 9th (Central News Agency) - German News Agency, London radio message: The Third British Dominion Conference will open in London on February 27.

### Price Stabilization and Disciplinary Enforcement Work in the Capital

— Ma Ji

As the end of the old year approaches, citizens of the capital are worried about rising prices. The military and political authorities have suddenly established a "Capital Materials Price Stabilization and Disciplinary Enforcement Committee," focusing on the free entry of rice into the city to implement price controls on daily necessities such as rice, oil, salt, firewood, fish, meat, chicken, and duck. However, as everyone knows, most of the capital's daily necessities come from the surrounding countryside. Recently, due to a lack of transportation, these materials are transported into the city by manpower and animal power, and the price difference between the countryside and the city is often as high as 30-40%. Needless to say, the reason is extortion by unscrupulous military police along the way. The extent of this extortion is increasing day by day, resulting in vendors being unable to bear the demands and hesitating to move forward. As a result, prices in the city are rising all the way, even blocking the source of food such as rice, affecting the food supply for the capital's 600,000 residents.

Since the situation is so serious, if it is allowed to continue naturally, the consequences will be unimaginable. In particular, the Allied military police are committed to absolutely assisting our authorities in promoting price stabilization. Therefore, the two tasks of price stabilization and disciplinary enforcement officially began on February 1st.

In terms of the seven major daily necessities, disciplinary enforcement is certainly more important than price stabilization. But to enforce discipline, the first step is to improve the treatment of the military police. The "Price Stabilization and Disciplinary Enforcement Committee" has formulated "Regulations for the Distribution of Living Subsidies to Military Police in the Capital Urban Area." The characteristics of this regulation are: first, the amount of the subsidy is determined according to the then-current price of daily necessities; second, the distribution is carried out by personnel from the "Price Stabilization Committee" on a named basis; third, officers, military police officers, and police chiefs who have direct relatives who are unable to work will receive a monthly allowance of 10,000 yuan per relative. If prices rise further, the allowance may be increased at any time.

Since the restoration of the free transport of goods into the city, prices have fallen considerably. For example, rice has returned from a high of 24,000 yuan to 17,000 yuan, and thatch has fallen from 32,000 yuan to 24,500 yuan. However, what the public is worried about is the authorities' determination to enforce discipline, and how long the price stability can be maintained.

The price stabilization and disciplinary enforcement work began on February 1st. On the seventh day, the military law group of the committee discovered that Hong Zongyan, a second lieutenant platoon leader of the communications team of the Second Guard Division, had been sending his subordinates to intercept and extort money from people from time to time, taking 20-30 yuan per donkey load, earning about 1,000 yuan per day. He was arrested by the supervision team, and after interrogation, the charges were confirmed. He was executed by firing squad at Yuhuatai at 3 p.m. on the 7th. Hong Zongyan is the third person to be executed at Yuhuatai for corruption, after Hou Hu and Li Yanhan.

Since the measures were so swift and decisive at the time, and the Allied military police were absolutely assisting, ordinary speculative merchants naturally did not dare to do evil openly. But their lives are fundamentally dependent on rising prices. Prices do not have to fall, as long as there is a period of stability, they will be unable to maintain their "business." Therefore, the "Capital Bank," which had been open for less than two months, had insufficient turnover and was sold off for a good price. In addition, if prices can remain stable for three months, perhaps half of the more than 50 small banks in the capital will have to close down.

The people of the capital are well aware of the illegal operations of small banks and pawnshops. But it is said that these small banks and pawnshops all have powerful backers. For example, the last time the municipal government thoroughly investigated bank warehouses and found evidence of hoarding, it was several banks such as a certain bank in Nanjing. It can be seen that in order to fundamentally suppress prices in the future, it is necessary to thoroughly prohibit powerful people from operating businesses concurrently.

Also, recently, due to the temporary stabilization of prices, and the rise in Shanghai, Nanjing is also experiencing a surge in gold prices. Yesterday, the price of jewelry gold broke through 15 levels per tael. It is said that there is still a black market. It is impossible to guarantee whether daily necessities such as rice and firewood will be stimulated by this and rise along with it. Moreover, although rice and firewood have become cheaper and stabilized, the price of vegetables is rising sharply (greens have broken through the 300 yuan level). In short, the citizens of the capital, like the citizens of Shanghai, are constantly worried about their livelihood. (Sent on the 7th)

Shanghai Municipal Administration - Volume 1

### Shanghai Municipal Administration in the Future

— Luo Junqiang

Shanghai is known as an international city, but it is actually an abnormal city. In the past, Shanghai's municipal administration outside the concessions did not have the appearance of a modern city, and within the concessions, political power was controlled by foreigners. As a result of being ruled by Anglo-American imperialism for a century, Shanghai has been burdened with various derogatory names such as "abnormal Shanghai" and "sinful Shanghai." Since the Allies advocated the return of the concessions, the Shanghai concessions have been recovered for more than a year. In the future, all unreasonable situations left over from the poisonous legacy of Anglo-American imperialism must be thoroughly eliminated, while the necessary constructions and technologies of the past should still be retained as much as possible and appropriately adjusted. In the future, Shanghai must be adapted to the Chinese political system, implement Chinese laws, and under the grand principle of returning East Asia to East Asia, make Shanghai a Shanghai of China.

The past society of Shanghai, as a result of historical factors, emphasized foreign forces and had no national concept, recognized money and did not speak of justice, relied on power and had no law, and sought private gain without regard for public interest. This kind of atmosphere must be thoroughly eradicated. In the future, regardless of any bad forces, regardless of any interests, and without any consideration, we must sweep away past bad habits and gradually create a fresh atmosphere in Greater Shanghai.

Shanghai is the largest city in our country. Politically, it is a microcosm of China; economically, it is the heart of China; and culturally, it also has an important position. Especially at this critical time of decisive battle, in order to complete the war, we should do our best to make Shanghai's municipal administration coordinate with objective conditions, maintain the legitimate rights and interests of citizens, and reduce unnecessary suffering for citizens. It is hoped that the citizens of Shanghai, regardless of nationality or class, will cooperate sincerely with the municipal government to seek reasonable and legal improvement and development of Shanghai's municipal administration.

### Summary of the Municipal Government Structure (1)

— Ting Yu

The Shanghai Special Municipal Government began to have a unified organizational structure after August 1 last year. In terms of the current overview of the municipal government organization (please refer to the first table), there are nine bureaus, four offices, one library, seven county governments, six district offices, and two committees. Although councilors are not an organic organization (other bureaus, offices, libraries, etc. can independently issue documents to the outside world, councilors only assist the mayor and secretary-general in handling municipal affairs and cannot issue documents to the outside world), they belong to any bureau or office in the organizational system, so they are also considered a unit.

Currently, the Shanghai Municipal Government has two characteristics in terms of organization: First, the current city of Shanghai has both urban areas and suburban county areas, and its scope seems to be between a province and a city. According to the regulations of the city organization law, all administrative affairs of the municipal government are directly handled by the bureaus and offices for the citizens, without district offices or county governments. The current system in Shanghai has districts and counties outside the bureaus, which is a dual administrative system. However, this characteristic cannot be changed based on financial and security considerations. Second, the current organization of the Shanghai Municipal Government is huge. In other provinces and cities, the affairs managed by one agency are divided into two or three agencies in Shanghai. For example, the affairs managed by the Goods Allocation Office belong to the Economic Bureau in various provinces and cities; the affairs managed by the Land and Housing Management Committee for Absentee Owners belong to the Finance Bureau or the Land Administration Bureau in various provinces and cities. However, this fact is of course established due to the large population of Shanghai or other special characteristics.

The so-called municipal government is a general term that includes all affiliated agencies. The mayor is the highest leader of the municipal government, and he directs and supervises all agencies. The Secretariat of the Municipal Government is the central nervous system of the entire municipal government, carrying out the orders of the mayor and carrying out the actual and technical integrated work of directing and supervising the affiliated agencies.

For the sake of simplicity and clarity, this article focuses on tabular methods. The first table is the organizational system of the entire municipal government, and then the cell organizations and their jurisdiction of the affiliated agencies will be published successively. The order is first bureau, then office, and then various committees. When all agencies are presented in tables, the scope of responsibilities must be noted for departments arranged in numbers, such as the first section and the second section. Where the duties have been indicated, such as the General Affairs Section and the Investigation Section, they will no longer be indicated.

### Symposium on the Price Problem (Part 1)

The price problem in our city, though extremely complex, has not, in our opinion, been managed reasonably. Since Mr. Xu Baoting took over as the new Director of the Economic Bureau, he has been actively seeking adjustments. For the sake of gathering diverse opinions, our newspaper has specially invited Director Xu, as well as figures from the economic world, including Mr. Chen Jin Chenyilang, Chen Riping, He Kan, Yao Qingsan, Xiang Kangyuan, and Li Zulu, to hold a symposium on the price problem. The symposium will be presided over by our newspaper's President Chen. The proceedings of the symposium are recorded as follows:

President Chen of this newspaper: The current high prices have a great impact on the country, society, and the lives of the people. Therefore, our newspaper has invited Director Xu of the Economic Bureau and all of you, hoping that you will express your valuable opinions on various important economic issues and discuss them in detail, centering on Director Xu. Today, there are four main points for discussion:

How should the standards for assessing prices be determined? In the past, despite the government's price controls, the black market still existed, and the prices assessed by the government were completely out of touch with the actual prices. On the one hand, it is true that the business community lacked the spirit of abiding by the law. On the other hand, the assessment of prices was baseless and could not take into account production costs, making it difficult to comply with the law in practice. Therefore, what methods should be used to assess prices, and what standards should be followed, are all issues worthy of study.

Methods for dealing with the black market. Once prices have been assessed, they should be absolutely adhered to, and the black market should be absolutely eliminated. Therefore, how to deal with the black market is the second issue we will discuss today.

Assessing prices and eliminating the black market are impossible without managing materials. Otherwise, it will be impossible to prevent hoarding within the industry and stockpiling outside the industry, and the upward trend of prices cannot be controlled. As a result, assessed prices will follow the rising prices. In addition, how to increase production should be planned comprehensively, and the prerequisite is also the management of materials. Therefore, the third issue we will discuss today is how to manage materials.

In the past, the rise in prices has been met with much public criticism. Now that the Economic Bureau has adjusted its personnel and strengthened its internal structure, it will surely bring a fresh start and meet the expectations of the citizens. With regard to trade associations, they should be strengthened first, and those with similar natures should be merged to reduce units and increase strength, so that the entire economic structure of Shanghai can move towards a sound path. This is the fourth issue that needs to be discussed.

Now, let us first ask Mr. Xu to express his high views on the past work of the Economic Bureau and its future policies.

Xu Jiang: Price Assessment Standards: Regarding the productivity of goods, the prices in this city can be roughly divided into three types: agricultural products, industrial raw materials, and industrial finished products: (1) Agricultural products will have appropriate prices set based on investigations of prices at the place of origin and transportation and purchase situations, so as not to fluctuate at any time. (2) For industrial raw materials, the existing inventory in the urban area will be registered first, and sales will be restricted to prevent non-industry personnel from manipulating and affecting industrial costs. (3) For industrial finished products, the prices of raw materials have already been stabilized first, and then various aspects of factory costs and profits will be adjusted, so that the set prices will not be without standards.

Regarding management, the Price Assessment Council of this city is currently reorganizing its structure to strengthen the assessment power, and carefully supervise the pricing of trade associations, in order to ensure that the prices will be effective once they are assessed, and that the black market will disappear invisibly.

Methods for dealing with the black market: Recently, the high prices in this city have been caused by a complex set of factors. The use of a kind of black market by unscrupulous merchants has made it impossible for the public to trade without it, which hinders national policies and increases the burden on the people. This is truly hateful. This bureau has now strengthened its assessment power so that the effectiveness of the assessment can be comparable to the supply and demand of materials, without the need for the opportunity of the black market. If there is evidence that illegal elements are manipulating the black market, they will be severely punished to make the black market disappear invisibly.

Methods for managing materials: 1. Universally carry out electricity registration for industrial and commercial use, in order to unify management and increase production efficiency. 2. Send letters to various water and electricity companies to check whether the current power-using factories are legal and re-approve them. 3. Quickly register major commodities to prevent merchants from hoarding and manipulating. The registration method is based on filling out classified record books in accordance with the format. After the registration is completed, this bureau will formulate measures and submit them for approval and implementation. As for other controlled items, please also ask the relevant agencies to send the registered quantities to this bureau for verification on a monthly basis. 4. If major commodities that have not been registered encounter applications for movement certificates, they will not be accepted, in order to prevent such malpractices as non-industry personnel taking the opportunity to hoard and manipulate.

Reorganization of trade associations: According to the Provisional Regulations on Industrial and Commercial Trade Associations promulgated in the 32nd year of the Republic of China, the organization of trade associations was originally intended to assist the government in implementing new economic policies, while also seeking the development of various industries and increasing production to meet wartime needs. However, the quality of the trade associations themselves has a great impact on the future of implementing new economic policies. Among the more than 200 trade associations in this city, the majority have a long history and sound organization, but there are also not a few that need to be adjusted due to improper personnel selection or overlapping organizations. The former should be strengthened, and the latter should be rectified in order to achieve soundness and avoid hindering the welfare of the industry and hindering the promotion of economic policies. For example, those with similar and overlapping organizations should be merged separately to be in accordance with the facts; increase the authority of the chairman of the board, and elect upright people to fill the position, so as to help promote government orders and make the movement of business conditions fully integrated into the right track. Then, advising registration, preventing hoarding, suppressing prices, and increasing production can achieve cooperative effects and adapt to the current important tasks. This is the recent mission of this bureau to reorganize trade associations.

He Kan: (1) Price Assessment Standards (A) For materials transported from other ports, the following items must be noted: Production costs, Local wholesale prices, Transportation costs, Losses along the way, Storage losses, Legitimate and illegitimate taxes along the way, Capital interest, Wholesale profits (not exceeding 20% of the total of the above seven items), Distributor profits (not exceeding 30% of the total of the above eight items). It is best to have well-known figures who are enthusiastic about public welfare personally go to the procurement location to conduct a trial purchase of a batch of goods, so that the assessment will not be deceived by merchants.

(B) For imported goods stockpiled in the hands of merchants, the following items must be noted: The original price before the incident, multiplied by the general cost of living index, must not be raised due to shortages. The price at which merchants purchase from stockpilers must be reasonable, and those who are unreasonable must be severely ordered to return the overcharged price. The pricing is still based on item A as the standard. Distributor profits must not exceed 30% of the above item's cost, and those who raise prices will be severely punished.

(C) Items manufactured in this city: Raw material value (calculated according to item A for those imported from other ports, and calculated according to item (B) for imported goods), Power consumption, Management fees and wages, Storage fees and consumption, Transportation fees, Capital interest, Manufacturer profits, not exceeding 20% of total expenses, Distributor profits, not exceeding 30% of purchase price.

(2) Methods for dealing with the black market: The Chinese and Japanese governments must absolutely cooperate, and the people of China and Japan must absolutely obey. Chinese, Japanese, and other foreign merchants holding materials must truthfully register, and any government guarantees not to use coercive means to confiscate these registered goods. It is strictly forbidden for officials to accept bribes to conceal merchants. For sold goods, there must be a receipt stub, which must state the name and address of the recipient for random checks. Strictly deal with selling inferior goods at high prices. Those who do not obey orders will be severely punished.

(3) Methods for managing materials: Absolutely prevent stockpiling by non-industry personnel, and prevent stockpilers from selling stockpiled goods within a certain period of time, and the price is assessed according to item 1. Buyers must register the names and quantities of the materials they purchase with the government at any time. Any stockpilers and merchants who do not sell goods should be severely punished. The goods sold and the remaining inventory each day must be recorded on a separate list and submitted to the various associations for submission to the Economic Bureau for verification. This regulation is jointly complied with by Chinese, Japanese, and foreign merchants, and those who do not comply will be subject to the same punishment.

(4) Reorganization of trade associations: Operators of each type of material or business should only form a unified trade association, and should not create names to set up similar associations. The association is a place for colleagues to exchange opinions and connect feelings, and should not operate its own business. If the association wants to revise the selling prices of goods and wages, it must submit a request to the competent authority for approval with appropriate reasons before it can be implemented. If there are hooligans and local tyrants who control the association with evil forces, the competent authority has the right to punish and terminate them.

We welcome submissions to this publication.
