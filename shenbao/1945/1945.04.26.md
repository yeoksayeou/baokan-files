### Japanese Troops Firmly Defend the First Line of Defense, Fiercely Fighting in Southern Okinawa, Naval Attack Aircraft Continue Intense Kamikaze Attacks

Tokyo, 25th (Central News Agency) - The enemy's attacks in the southern area of Okinawa Island, specifically Kijima, have intensified since the 23rd. The areas of Uebaru, 1.5 kilometers west of Tsutaba, and Sakibaru, 1 kilometer south of Geku, are experiencing the most intense fighting. Enemy forces, numbering over a thousand, accompanied by a dozen tanks, are closing in on Japanese positions. However, Japanese troops are firmly defending the first line of defense and fighting fiercely. Furthermore, the enemy's movements one kilometer west of Tobe Yama Kashiki are less vigorous than those east of that location, suggesting they are diligently replenishing their forces and preparing for the next operation. From the start of the enemy's general offensive on the 19th until noon on the 23rd, the enemy's losses have been determined as follows: 6,000 soldiers killed or wounded, 80 tanks destroyed, 11 artillery pieces destroyed, 4 supply depots destroyed, 2 mortars captured, 36 heavy and light machine guns captured, 1 anti-aircraft gun captured, 2 anti-tank rapid-firing guns captured. In addition, a large number of vehicles, weapons, ammunition, and other items were destroyed. Moreover, the attacks by Japanese naval special attack aircraft continue to be fierce. It has been confirmed that the results of the kamikaze attacks on the 22nd include the sinking or severe damage of two enemy aircraft carriers and ten battleships, cruisers, and large vessels. In addition, several vessels of unidentified type have also been damaged.

Tokyo, 25th (Central News Agency) - On the Northern Shuri Front, enemy forces, including American troops, launched a general offensive beginning on the 19th. Japanese troops mounted a courageous defense along the entire line, inflicting a severe blow, with enemy casualties reaching 6,000 by the 23rd. The enemy only made some progress in the western coastal area. The offensive largely faltered by the 6th day (24th), and they currently appear to be preparing for future attacks. Several localized battles occurred on the 24th, but no active enemy offensive was observed. From the 19th to the 20th, the enemy's infantry strength decreased from approximately 10,000 to 6,000, and the number of tanks decreased to approximately 90. Moreover, the fierce attacks by the Japanese special attack units against enemy warships at sea have inflicted great damage on the enemy fleet, leading to a noticeable decrease in enemy naval bombardment of Okinawa Island. When the enemy landed, the average daily bombardment exceeded 7,000 rounds. This decreased to 5,500 rounds on the second day (20th), 4,500 rounds on the 21st, 3,000 rounds on the 22nd, and further reduced sharply to 2,000 rounds on the 23rd.

### Air Battle Intensifies Again

Japanese Naval Air Base, 25th (Central News Agency) - In recent days, several unusual phenomena have occurred on the Okinawa battlefield. First, the enemy's mobile task force on the Okinawa battlefield has retreated. Regardless of whether the purpose is to prepare for the next operation or to reorganize its strength, its presence in the Okinawa Sea has gradually disappeared. Second, the number of enemy warships off Okinawa has decreased significantly. As of the 23rd, there were about 150 warships, including a small number of battleships, mainly concentrated in the Kerama Islands, with others scattered in the seas off the northern and central airfields and in Nago Bay and Kadena Bay. This is undoubtedly the result of continuous and fierce Japanese attacks, causing the enemy to suffer heavy losses. However, the enemy seems to have completed its planned supply objective. The enemy is now attempting to bomb Japanese forward bases, replacing its mobile task force with land-based air power. On the 21st and 22nd, over a hundred B-29 aircraft flew from bases in the Mariana Islands, causing the air battle over the air bases of both sides to intensify again. The enemy airfield in Okinawa has gathered approximately 200 aircraft, including F6F and F4V carrier-based fighters, P-38 and P-51 long-range fighters, B-24 bombers, and P-51 night fighters. In addition, a large number of patrol aircraft TBU and flying boats are concentrated in the Kerama Islands, coordinating with the P-51 and P-38 aircraft from Iwo Jima, attempting to destroy Japanese land-based air power. However, the enemy cannot use air power without limitations. This can be understood based on past facts. The enemy aircraft have not attacked the Ogasawara Islands, which also proves that the enemy has exhausted its greatest strength in challenging the Japanese bases. The enemy has lost a large number of warships and mobile task forces, and is still attempting to invade the mainland by advancing air bases. Therefore, the Okinawa operation is the most difficult operation for the enemy.

Southern Japanese Base, 25th (Central News Agency) - After Japanese forces began a general offensive against enemy warships around Okinawa, special attack naval aircraft, to prevent the enemy's landing operation, conducted night raids on the northern airfield on the 20th and 21st. Several fires were confirmed near the runways. As a result of fear, the enemy recently gathered a hundred P-38, P-47, and P-51 Douglas-type small aircraft at that airfield to help cover the warships. However, after this night raid, their strength was visibly weakened. During the night raid, the anti-aircraft fire at the airfield was extremely sparse, and there were no searchlights, only a few night fighters in pursuit.

Okinawa: One Month of Japanese Military Achievements

Tokyo, 25th (Central News Agency) - It has been over a month since enemy American forces landed a portion of their troops on the Kerama Islands on March 25th and began the invasion operation on Okinawa Island. Since 10:00 PM on April 1st, the enemy began landing operations with the main force at several points on the 12-kilometer mountain front from the vicinity of Kitatani in the southwest of Okinawa Island to Zanpa Cape. The Japanese garrison troops, who had been conserving their strength and awaiting the opportunity, immediately launched a courageous counterattack, inflicting considerable losses on the enemy in the coastal defense. The enemy persisted in landing, attempting to increase its strength. By evening of the same day, its strength had increased to around two divisions. On the 2nd, the enemy advanced towards Kadena during the day. On the 3rd, it advanced from south of Kitatani through Shimabukuro to the east coast and the vicinity of Awase. By the 8th, the enemy's front line had penetrated to Tsuta and the southern side of Mt. Oyama, reaching the vicinity of Kashiki. During this period, Japanese troops launched courageous and repeated attacks day and night. By the 7th, the enemy had suffered approximately 3,006 casualties and 103 tanks were immobilized. In addition, various artillery pieces were destroyed. On the 7th, the enemy further landed 5,000 troops and 130 tanks in Nago Bay in the northern area, and the battle gradually intensified. In response, Japanese troops launched a fierce bayonet charge on the southern front from the night of the 10th, inflicting a major blow on the enemy. Up to the 11th since the landing, the confirmed battle results were approximately 6,300 casualties and 185 tanks and armored vehicles immobilized and set on fire, as well as 48 destroyed motorized vehicles. From the evening of the 12th, another large-scale counteroffensive was launched in close cooperation between infantry and artillery, thwarting the enemy's offensive intentions. As of the 15th, an additional 1,700 enemy troops were killed or wounded. After this, the enemy actively increased its strength, landing a total of six divisions: two divisions in the southern part of the island, one division in the Motobu Peninsula, and approximately one division in the Kerama, Ie Island, and other islands. The enemy pushed artillery and supplies forward and expanded and improved the northern and central airfields, attempting to reverse the situation with a desperate effort focused on that battle. Therefore, on the 19th, the enemy began a full-scale attack with approximately 10,000 infantry and dozens of tanks in the western part of the island. In response to this enemy attack, Japanese troops stationed in the area launched a night raid on the 20th, repelling most of the enemy and securing the first line, continuing to fight fiercely. From the 19th to noon on the 23rd, the enemy suffered approximately 6,000 casualties, 80 destroyed and immobilized tanks, and 11 destroyed artillery pieces. As a result, the enemy's strength in that area was drastically reduced to 5,600 troops, and the number of tanks was also reduced to 90. Since the 24th, the enemy has been regrouping troops and materials, preparing for the next offensive. Japanese troops, with fewer soldiers, fought bravely against the landing enemy forces of more than six divisions for a month, killing 14,000 enemy troops, destroying 313 tanks and motorized vehicles, and destroying 44 artillery pieces, inflicting other considerable damage.

Nanjing Correspondence

### The Life of Civil Servants in the Capital

— By Ren Ping

The place with the most civil servants is Nanjing. Nanjing is the political center of the country, the location of the capital. There is a forest of civil and military organizations, from the five Yuans and various ministries of the National Government to the affiliated small organizations, and even peripheral efforts. There are dozens of them, large and small. Therefore, the number of civil servants is very large. Among them, some have been floating in the officialdom since the Northern Expedition moved the capital in the sixteenth year of the Republic. There is no accurate statistic of the exact number recently. There are 29,768 civil servants in the city, accounting for more than 2% of the city's population. The current number has certainly increased or decreased slightly, but not by much.

A Life of Hardship

Before the war, civil servants lived on their salaries like everyone else, but they could be called the darlings of heaven, because the treatment they received was excellent, the life they lived was comfortable, and they became powerful consumers in the city. But under the current high pressure of life, they have become one of the least able to consume in various industries. Their lives are full of hardship. They are often in a state of bewilderment for the life of a family of several people. They simply have no spare strength to fight the high tide of life. Their lives are really worthy of sympathy.

Their positions also often lack security. When the superiors make a transfer, they often change completely. Therefore, some people have to imitate the cunning rabbit and build three burrows. Their difficulties are definitely not something outsiders can imagine.

Monthly Salary Increases Over the Years

The cost of living has been rising year by year, and the authorities have also been trying their best to increase salaries year by year, but the increase is limited and can never keep pace with the unlimited prices. The official salary table that has been used all along was revised in the 23rd year of the Republic. From the highest-level selection and appointment of 1,200 yuan to the lowest-level assignment of 55 yuan. In recent years, due to the impact of prices, there have been several increases in subsidies. The first time was in the 31st year when a temporary increase of 20% for the selected and specially appointed, 40% for the simplified appointed, 60% for the recommended appointed, and 80% for the commissioned appointed. In the 32nd year, the same two, four, six, and eight increases were added. In January of the 33rd year, in addition to this, two, three, four, and five times the original salary were added. In May of the same year, a special subsidy of one-half of the salary was added again, but the affiliated institutions of various ministries not directly under the Executive Yuan only added one-half. In July of the same year, the previous increases were cancelled and re-adjusted into temporary subsidies of nine, ten, twelve, and fourteen times, but the special subsidies were still issued. At the same time, each person was given subsidized rice every good month. In the second month after the implementation, it was converted into cash due to some reason. The official salary improvement in January of this year was the most recent adjustment, that is, the selection and appointment were changed to adding 50,000 yuan to the highest level in addition to the original salary amount, 40,000 yuan for special appointments, and 33,000 yuan for the highest level of simplified appointments, with a decrease of 1,500 yuan for each level. 22,000 yuan was added to the highest level of recommended appointment, with a decrease of 1,000 yuan for each level, 12,000 yuan was added to the highest level of commissioned appointment, with a decrease of 800 yuan for each level until after the ninth level, with a decrease of 300 yuan for each level. The above-mentioned temporary subsidies are still issued together at the previous amount. At the same time, the salary was also changed to three pecks of actual goods, and three pecks were converted into cash. The amount of cash conversion was also increased to almost the actual rice price. It is said that the total monthly salary subsidy for all civil and military officials of the National Government is currently more than 140 million yuan.

The Lowest Cost of Living

Can the treatment civil servants receive really maintain the minimum living expenses of his family? This is the first question that cannot be answered at present. If what they receive is indeed not enough to cope with life, then how are they getting by? This is the second question that cannot be answered.

We can now list the various prices of daily necessities in Nanjing, calculated for each civil servant with a family of three (of course, many are not this number). The most necessary amount each month can be listed in the table below:

(Rice) Three pecks (combined with three pecks of subsidized rice to make six pecks) Calculated at 40,000 yuan per stone 12,000 yuan

(Firewood) 200 catties Calculated at 4,000 yuan per 100 catties 8,000 yuan

(Vegetables) Calculated at 500 yuan per day 15,000 yuan

(Oil) (Including other seasonings) 1,000 yuan

(Maintenance) (Including rent, water and electricity, etc.) 1,000 yuan

Total 37,000 yuan

The above are all the minimum amounts, and the actual amount should be more than this. What's more, there are other odd expenses, but it already costs 37,000 yuan. However, when we look at the highest monthly salary of a commissioned official, including subsidies, it is only 15,000 yuan. Even if we add the converted price of three pecks of rice, which is about 10,000 yuan, it is still far from the above amount. What's more, the lowest-level commissioned official only gets 4,325 yuan? It is really not as good as the income of a laborer. Even the highest-level elected official only gets 61,000 yuan a month! They are still elected officials and can still cope, but other simplified recommendations and commissions have no way to cope with the current life.

The life of civil servants is so difficult. To prevent the restless from taking the road of corruption and bribery, and to rectify officialdom and increase administrative efficiency, we can only wait for the increase in official salaries. As for how to increase it, it depends on how the authorities plan it.

Editorial

### Defend the Ryukyus

The battle situation in the Ryukyu Islands, with the fierce battle for the defense of Okinawa Island as its center, is unfolding dramatically. The intensity of the war can be said to be the first in the Pacific, and the importance of its strategic significance can be fully demonstrated from the following three points: First, the forces currently dispatched by the enemy to the Ryukyus are mainly composed of mobile units, supplemented by the elite of the Pacific forces, forming a concentrated large force. These are all base units that the enemy Americans have always regarded as life. Second, the main force of the enemy British may be mobilized to participate in the battle. Third, in view of the enemy's all-or-nothing approach, the Allies also have the actual tendency to dispatch elite forces to participate in the battle in order to seize the opportunity to give them a crushing blow. Therefore, this battle of the Ryukyus will be a decisive battle at the critical moment of life and death.

Why did the enemy strategically choose the Ryukyu Islands to launch a decisive battle? According to the observations of military experts, their motives are nothing more than this. That is, first, the enemy's main strategic goal is to establish a strong air base in the Ryukyu Islands, attempting to gain air supremacy over the western half of the Japanese mainland, so that it can cooperate with the enemy base in the Mariana Islands to control the air supremacy in the eastern half of the Japanese mainland. Second, striving for the air and naval bases in the Sugashima Islands will further gain control of the air and sea in the East China Sea. On the one hand, they attempt to cut off the connection between Taiwan and the South Seas to the Japanese mainland, and even more肆胁 the sea and land transportation between China, Japan, and Manchuria. Third, the enemy has established three strongholds surrounding the Japanese mainland in the Mariana Islands, Luzon Island, and Ryukyu Island. They will then advance to seize the Ryukyu base in an attempt to complete the strategic situation of surrounding the Japanese mainland on the east, south, and west sides. At that time, they will advance eastward to Kyushu and westward to the Chinese coast to carry out invasion operations.

However, the enemy's strategic attempt has already suffered a serious blow from the Japanese special attack force in practice. The most important failure of the enemy: First, due to the powerful resistance of the Allied special attack force, they had to concentrate their most elite forces in the Okinawa Island area, and therefore could not invade the Japanese mainland in other areas, so that the Allies could fully and completely defend their defenses and use their forces at leisure. Second, the Allied forces in the Philippines continue to persist in the battle, dispersing and weakening the enemy's flanking forces, and cannot strengthen disturbances in Taiwan and the Chinese coast. Third, the Allied forces on the Chinese mainland continue to advance, which on the one hand contains a large number of enemy air forces and other forces, and on the other hand, also hits the morale of the enemy invading the Ryukyus.

What is particularly noteworthy is that the Allied military authorities have already completed the decisive battle posture to annihilate the enemy in order to counter the enemy's invasion of the mainland. What the Allies are looking forward to is that if the enemy concentrates its maximum force on a certain battle, then it can give it a fatal annihilation in one fell swoop. Now that the enemy has attempted to break into the Japanese mainland from the Ryukyus with its main forces, then it is an opportunity for the Allies to annihilate them. As a result, not only will a corner of the air encirclement of Japan be destroyed, but the air and sea supremacy in the western Pacific will be regained in one fell swoop. Just as the Japanese army and navy of the Allies declared in the parliament, the opportunity for a major counteroffensive is about to turn. Therefore, in this battle of the Ryukyus, the Allies will surely be able to fully exert the power of the Japanese navy in the past and achieve the goal of annihilating the enemy. Now the elite of the Allies is representing the common hatred of the enemy of the 100 million people of the country, full of fighting will, and with the great spirit of self-sacrifice of the special attack force, the whole body is engaged in a collision with the enemy. This is a powerful guarantee for the final victory of the Greater East Asia War. We, the people of East Asia, are awed by the seriousness of the battle situation, and we must redouble our confidence and work hard in our own positions, looking forward to future good news.

### Municipal Government to Take Strict Measures Against Gold Speculation; Implementation Pending Approval from the Executive Yuan

Mayor Zhou of this city, in view of the excessively sharp rise in gold prices, which he ultimately fears will affect general commodity prices, specifically telegraphed Secretary-General Luo of the municipal government in Nanjing to take necessary measures. After receiving the order, Secretary-General Luo, on the one hand, notified the Police Bureau to pay close attention. If there is a sharp rise in gold prices in the future, the Economic Police will strictly inquire and investigate the responsibilities of gold brokers and traders. On the other hand, he convened a meeting of key personnel from the Economic and Finance Bureaus and consulted with relevant agencies to consider future countermeasures. Implementation will commence after seeking instructions from the Mayor and receiving approval from the Executive Yuan.

Crackdown Should be Increased on Prices Exceeding Limits

Recently, commodity prices in this city have been stimulated by financial fluctuations and have risen sharply. Both the black market for daily necessities and the retail prices in various businesses have increased by more than 20% compared to before, significantly increasing the burden on the lives of ordinary citizens. In view of this, the authorities have taken strict measures to stabilize finances and suppress commodity prices. Investigations are being conducted. Recently, the financial market has gradually returned to normal. Gold, silver dollars, public bonds, and Chinese stocks have all uniformly fallen. Rice in the black market has retreated below the ten-thousand mark. However, the retail prices of other businesses have not been clearly marked and sold at the official prices, and some businesses are even selling key commodities at prices exceeding the limits set by the Municipal Economic Bureau. Such merchants who outwardly comply but inwardly defy the regulations are harming the livelihood of citizens, and should be severely punished.

Brief Commentary: No More Hesitation; Pay Attention to Public Associations That Have Not Paid for Relief Bonds

The Municipal Government of this city has issued 1.5 billion yuan of temporary relief...[illegible character]...bonds, of which 450 million yuan is to be undertaken by various trade associations. At a tea party on March 17, the municipal government invited the responsible persons of each trade association to clarify the purpose and, through the joint decision of the Municipal Economic Bureau and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, determined the grade of each trade association and allocated the number of subscriptions according to the grade, with a deadline for payment at the end of March. However, according to the list of trade associations that have subscribed and the amounts published today, only about 40% of the target has been reached. A large number of trade associations have not paid within the deadline, and now that the time has passed...[illegible character]...month, these trade associations have still not paid, which is regrettable.

The purpose of the municipal relief...[illegible character]...bonds is to carry out public welfare undertakings for the citizens of this city. Members of all trade associations are members of the industrial and commercial circles of this city and have the obligation to contribute money and effort to the public welfare undertakings of this city. The Municipal Economic Bureau and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce have determined the grade of the trade associations based on objective grounds, and will not...[illegible character]...exceed the ability of each trade association to bear the cost. The fact that some trade associations have complied with the deadline is commendable, while the fact that some trade associations are still taking a wait-and-see attitude and have not...[illegible character]...paid within the stipulated time shows that the persons in charge of the trade associations have clearly failed to fulfill their responsibility to supervise. We hope that the persons in charge of these trade associations will promptly take responsibility for urging payment and remit the full amount as soon as possible, in order to conclude the matter...[illegible character]...avoid controversy.
