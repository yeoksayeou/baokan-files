### U.S. State Department Makes Emergency Decision, Truman Succeeds as President, Issues First Message Declaring Continued Warfare, Orders San Francisco Conference to Proceed as Planned

Lisbon, 13th (Central News Agency Telegram) - After receiving notification from the White House at 5:25 PM on the 12th, Vice President Truman rushed to the White House by car. At 6:00 PM, he convened an emergency cabinet meeting. After discussion, it was decided, in accordance with Article 60 of the United States Constitution, that Vice President Truman would ascend to become the 32nd President. Truman was immediately sworn in and requested that the members of the State Department remain in their positions. Truman was originally a judge from Missouri. After the implementation of the national defense plan in the spring of 1935, he served as the chairman of the Senate Military Production Investigation Committee, working hard to increase military production, overcome many difficulties, and implement national mobilization. He established a major central force in Congress and subsequently gained Roosevelt's trust and was selected as Vice President. Therefore, it is anticipated that his future policies will continue to adopt a strict general mobilization approach. Truman is 61 years old this year. During the previous Great War, he served as a captain in a heavy artillery regiment and went to the front lines for combat, possessing practical combat experience.

Lisbon, 13th (Central News Agency Telegram) - According to a Reuters dispatch: Truman will turn 61 on May 8th. He was first elected as a Senator on November 6, 1934, and was re-elected on November 5, 1940, with his term expiring on January 3, 1947. He was nominated as the Vice Presidential candidate at the Democratic Party Convention last summer.

Lisbon, 13th (Central News Agency Telegram) - Chairman of the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Connally, stated: The San Francisco Conference on the United Nations' discussion of world security organizations may be postponed due to Roosevelt's death, but the State Department stated that the San Francisco Conference will not be suspended due to the President's death.

### Mrs. Roosevelt Notifies Four Sons

### Churchill and Others Extremely Disturbed

Lisbon, 13th (Central News Agency Telegram) - The news of Roosevelt's death caused a major shock to the British government and public. The British people were extremely astonished by this unexpected event. Reporters from various countries went to the British government to inquire about Churchill's opinion, but British government officials informed them that Churchill was extremely disturbed after receiving the news of Roosevelt's passing, and therefore they were unable to ascertain the Prime Minister's opinion today.

Lisbon, 13th (Central News Agency Telegram) - According to a report from the Associated Press correspondent in Chongqing, Chiang Kai-shek received the shocking news of Roosevelt's death while having breakfast. He was stunned for a moment, stopped eating, and showed a sorrowful expression. Chiang had met with Roosevelt in Cairo in 1943 and regarded Roosevelt as a sincere friend of Chongqing, holding him in boundless admiration. Key figures in Chongqing also believe that Roosevelt's death is a major setback for the anti-Axis forces. It is also deeply regrettable that Roosevelt passed away before seeing the end of the war.

### Major Impact on the Anti-Axis Camp

Tokyo, 13th (Central News Agency Telegram) - Roosevelt's sudden death occurred during the critical period when the anti-Axis countries were urgently working to complete the war. Therefore, it is like a bolt from the blue for the anti-Axis. Since the outbreak of the European war, Roosevelt actively aided Britain and harmed Japan's position in East Asia, adopting hostile actions that forced Japan to take up arms for self-defense, leading to the world war. He was truly the culprit behind the war. He was also a proponent of aggressive navalism and economic imperialism, the main culprit in disrupting world peace. As for his political skills, he was an outstanding talent among American presidents throughout history. Roosevelt fully demonstrated extraordinary talent in rebuilding the domestic system and promoting American foreign policy after the New Deal. In this war, he was also the leader guiding the anti-Axis camp. Therefore, his sudden death has had a very heavy and great impact on the United States domestically. The American political circles after Roosevelt's death have lost their supreme wartime leader and will gradually fall into chaos. Whether Truman can inherit Roosevelt's legacy and strongly maintain the domestic wartime system remains doubtful. The San Francisco Conference, which is about to be held, will lose Roosevelt as its chairperson. The psychological impact on the anti-Axis countries can be imagined. Most importantly, the alliance of the three giants, Roosevelt, Churchill, and Stalin, has collapsed due to Roosevelt's death. During this war, Roosevelt and Churchill have truly worked together wholeheartedly to guide the anti-Axis camp in combat. Therefore, Roosevelt held a very important position among the three giants. Churchill's position has been shaken after losing Roosevelt, which will have a great impact on the future war strategies of the anti-Axis forces.

The Japanese side suffered the loss of one suicide plane and another plane was forced to land.

Editorial

### After Roosevelt's Death

U.S. President Roosevelt passed away from a cerebral hemorrhage on the 11th of this month, plunging the domestic situation into chaos. Its future trend deserves special attention.

Roosevelt, a scion of an aristocratic family, has been elected as U.S. President since defeating Hoover on November 8, 1932, and was repeatedly elected as President in 1936, 1940, and 1944, breaking the American political convention, which is a rare phenomenon in the world. During his more than twelve years in power, from the implementation of the so-called "New Deal" to participation in World War II, we will not discuss his merits and demerits or the evolution of the domestic and foreign political situation in the United States, but as far as the Greater East Asia War is concerned, he was clearly the direct instigator. Today, it is not yet the time to infer a comprehensive transformation of the United States' political and military strategies simply because the originator of the East Asia War has died. Therefore, it is inevitable that Roosevelt's death will greatly impact the United States' overall political and strategic situation, affecting its domestic and foreign policies and operations. This is our first point of observation regarding the enemy United States' movements after Roosevelt's death.

Whether Roosevelt's more than twelve years in power were good for the United States and the world is one thing, but it is also universally acknowledged that he was one of the main figures in modern international politics. Domestically, he gradually became an idol in the minds of the national people, leading to the fact that he was elected four times in a row. In the future, it will not be easy, or even impossible, for the United States to find a figure like Roosevelt who can represent financial, industrial, and capitalist interests. Internationally, he negotiated between the conflicting camps of Britain and the Soviet Union, and through the Tehran and Crimea conferences, he was able to temporarily reduce the suspicion and improve the relations among the three countries of Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union, which were deeply contradictory. In the future, it will be difficult to find someone among these three countries who is good at rhetoric to maintain their connection! Therefore, after Roosevelt's death, the internal chaos in the United States and the surfacing and aggravation of the opposition between the three countries of Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union are likely to be inevitable. This is our second point of observation regarding the movements of the enemy United States and the enemy camp after Roosevelt's death.

Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, Roosevelt has been the supreme commander of the enemy's land, sea, and air forces. In terms of the enemy United States' strategy, he was the most resolute advocate of a counteroffensive against the Japanese mainland. In terms of the anti-Axis camp's global strategy, he was also the staunch advocate of the strategy of attacking the Pacific before Europe, or at least attacking it simultaneously with Europe. Because of his firm stance, he caused opposition between the three countries of Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union, and between the key generals of the enemy United States. Now that Roosevelt has died, the strategy of the enemy Britain and the anti-Axis camp will inevitably be greatly affected. This is our third point of observation regarding the movements of the enemy United States and the enemy camp after Roosevelt's death.

The one who succeeds Roosevelt and exercises the power of president and commander-in-chief is the current Vice President Truman. Although he is a successor to Roosevelt's policies politically, his qualifications are ultimately too shallow. It remains a question whether he can cope with the complex and critical situation in the United States. As for the military commander-in-chief aspect, he may not be able to grasp the current huge-scale war situation, so it is inevitable that the enemy United States will experience a major chaos and dispute in its strategic and command issues in the future. As for diplomacy, Truman's position is not as good as succeeding Roosevelt's, so without mentioning other things, the San Francisco Conference scheduled to be held on April 25 may completely lose the original convening significance of the United States.

To sum up, we can see that the enemy has entered new political, military, and diplomatic difficulties. We East Asian peoples must further unite and cooperate, seize the opportunity, and crush the enemy's strategy to win the final victory.

### Zhao Xuanchang Discusses Promoting the Film Industry, Paying Attention to Themes and Improvements

Nanjing, 13th (Central News Agency Telegram) - The film industry is a tool for promoting cultural education, and its mission is quite important. Minister Zhao Xuanchang, in view of this, recently went to Shanghai to reorganize the China Film Company, personally assuming the position of chairman. It is believed that in the future, under Minister Zhao's guidance, the film industry will be completely renewed. After returning to Nanjing, Minister Zhao made the following remarks on this matter: "The film industry has the mission of cultural education, which goes without saying. Although the films of China Film Company cannot be said to be perfect, films such as 'Ten Thousand Generations of Glory', 'Long Live Teachers', and 'Repentance is at Hand' cannot be said to be unrelated to cultural education. Although general films may not be as good as those listed above, they are not without their merits.

After the return of the capital, he served as the Vice President of the Judicial Yuan and concurrently as the Chairman of the Central Civil Service Disciplinary Committee.

### The U.S. Attitude of Fooling the Chongqing Communists

Harley, the U.S. Ambassador to Chongqing, who was responsible for mediating the Chongqing-Communist Party compromise negotiations as a "Lu Zhonglian" (a famous persuader in Chinese history), left Chongqing with the U.S. commander in Chongqing, Wittmeyer, on February 28 to return to the United States. After this, a major change in the U.S. attitude towards Chongqing can be expected. Given the complex situation in which even U.S. pressure could not make the Chongqing Communists compromise, Harley will offer his country advice based on his painful experiences, and Wittmeyer will also report truthfully that the Chongqing Communist armies are only focused on civil war and are not making efforts to resist Japan. Since the top officials of the U.S. in Chongqing for both diplomatic and military affairs have both called for improving U.S. policy towards Chongqing based on a new understanding of Chongqing, the U.S. authorities will certainly have to consider it carefully.

Therefore, both Chongqing and Yan'an are sure to be paying close attention to what specific form the new U.S. attitude towards Chongqing will take. Whether the United States will support Chongqing or support Yan'an will determine the fate of both Chongqing and the Communist Party. On this point alone, it can be seen that Chongqing and the Communist Party are watching the true intentions of the United States with bloodshot eyes. Harley, who was staying in Washington, answered questions from reporters on the 2nd about the Communist Party's request for the United States to supply weapons, saying, "In our opinion, supplying weapons to a certain armed political group is tantamount to the United States recognizing a new belligerent group. But the United States recognizes and supports the Chongqing government." This makes it clear that the U.S. government only supports Chongqing and does not intend to supply weapons to Yan'an. This is of great significance, because it indicates the new policy of America's attitude towards Chongqing.

The attitude of the United States towards Chongqing that has been coming since last year has almost been one of criticizing Chongqing and supporting Yan'an, even citing the Mihailović regime and Tito regime of Yugoslavia as examples, calling Chongqing the Mihailović regime of China and attacking it fiercely. But towards Yan'an, the U.S. praised its democratic policies and, disregarding Chongqing's opposition, sent foreign journalists to inspect the Communist areas. At the end of January of this year, the American Red Cross sent about ten tons of medicines and medical equipment. The US's approach to Yan'an was rapidly progressing. Yan'an also catered to the United States, making various gestures to seek its aid in weapons and military supplies, and offering exchange conditions such as setting up secret airfields for the US military in the Communist areas, skillfully using the attitude of America to strengthen its political offensive against Chongqing.

But the US approach to Yan'an was merely a tactic to needle Chongqing in the service of pressuring the Chongqing government to rely more on the US while sacrificing Chongqing and Communist forces in the fight against Japan. And Harley's sudden change of heart after returning home, turning his back on Yan'an, is just trying to use the "support Chongqing" label as another tactical maneuver. Yan'an was of course greatly surprised by this sudden cold attitude from America; Xinmin Daily News, its official newspaper, published an editorial on the 5th that said: "Harley ignored the Chinese people's demands for democracy, greatly increasing the difficulty of Yan'an to unify China. It would not be an exaggeration to say that Harley's statement is enough to split China and contains the crisis of instigating internal strife." It expressed much resentment toward America's coldness. In short, it can be seen from the facts above that both Chongqing and Yan'an have been fooled by the United States; or at least that the so-called "China policy" of the United States has never considered promoting the welfare of the Chinese people.

### Sinking of Japanese Ship Awamaru: Remarks by Information Bureau Chief Iguchi on the Incident

Tokyo, 13th (Central News Agency) – Regarding the sinking of the Japanese ship Awamaru by a U.S. submarine, Iguchi, the third chief of the Information Bureau, met with foreign correspondents on the 13th to discuss the matter. He stated that concerning the Awamaru's voyage to the south, the U.S. government's notification of safe passage, relayed by the Swiss Legation in Tokyo on December 13th of last year, stated, "The United States and its allies will not attack or impede in any way the ship's transport of relief supplies to the south." However, the ship was eventually sunk, with a considerable loss of life. To date, the U.S. has not provided any notification regarding this incident. The Awamaru was traveling along a route jointly determined by Japan and the U.S. On March 30th (three days before the sinking), the Japanese government duly informed the U.S. government of a partial change in the ship's route, with the expectation that the ship would enter Tsuruga Port on April 5th. However, contact was lost from the evening of April 1st. The Japanese government expressed great concern about this but continued to believe in the U.S. government's guarantee of safety and awaited news. During a meeting with the press corps on April 6th, I mentioned that the ship would transport American relief supplies from the Soviet Union after returning from the south, and the Swiss Legation in Tokyo would notify the U.S. of this intention. However, the U.S. government did not respond. On April 11th, ten days after the ship was sunk, I also mentioned the ship's location during a meeting with foreign correspondents and stated that the Japanese government was requesting a response from the U.S. regarding this matter. However, as of April 12th, the U.S. government had not yet announced the sinking of the ship and only stated that one American survivor had been rescued. This person identified the sunken vessel as the Awamaru. It is inconceivable that the U.S. could not identify the Awamaru, as it was equipped with many lights and illuminated markings in accordance with Japanese-U.S. agreements, making it extremely easy to recognize in the surrounding waters. Moreover, after the ship was sunk, a considerable number of survivors remained at sea. Yesterday, the Japanese government, through the Swiss Legation, informed the U.S. government, reporting the details of the incident, as well as the number of rescued persons, their names, locations, health conditions, and handling procedures.

### Various Businesses in the City to Begin Using Special Tax Invoices Tomorrow: Municipal Government Announces Rules for Using Invoices

In order to rectify tax collection and strictly prevent corruption, the Municipal Bureau of Finance has specially formulated rules for businesses to collect the special consumption tax using invoices, which have been submitted to the Municipal Government for approval and are scheduled to be implemented starting April 15th. An excerpt from the Municipal Government's notice is as follows:

"It has been found that the special consumption tax is an important source of tax revenue under the wartime system, and the scope of collection is based on the amount of consumption, which is extremely fair. However, this tax has always been collected and remitted by various stores. A special consumption tax invoice has now been produced, ordered to be sold by the district tax collection offices, with each book containing 200 invoices. Apart from recovering the printing costs of 170 yuan, no other fees will be charged. All retail stores in this city should purchase and prepare them as soon as possible. From April 15th of this year, they must be used uniformly. If any store delays using these special tax invoices, once discovered or reported, they will be severely punished. The attached rules for collecting special tax invoices are hereby announced for general knowledge." Attached rules:

(Article 1) All retail stores that collect special consumption tax must use special tax invoices.

(Article 2) Stores selling specified tax-exempt items are exempt from using special tax invoices.

(Article 3) Special tax invoices are small, two-part forms printed with sequential numbers, the price of the item, the tax amount, and the date. The store must affix its seal and address. The first part is given to the buyer, and the second part is the stub, which the store must retain for one full year for inspection by the Bureau at any time.

(Article 4) Special tax invoices are printed by the Bureau and sold by the district tax collection offices. Each book contains 200 invoices. Apart from recovering the cost of paper and printing, no other fees will be charged.

(Article 5) Whenever a store purchases special tax invoices, it must purchase at least enough for one month's use and keep a register to record the date of purchase, the number of books, and the starting and ending numbers in detail for verification.

(Article 6) Companies and businesses that use their own pre-numbered invoices that can be verified and have been approved by the Bureau are exempt from the provisions of these rules.

(Article 7) Retailers with a particularly small scale who are truly unable to use invoices must first apply to the Bureau for an exemption. If approved, the special consumption tax they owe will be collected by estimating their business income.

(Article 8) Those who violate the provisions of these rules may be fined up to 50,000 yuan, and in serious cases, they may also be subject to suspension of business and other administrative penalties.

(Article 9) These rules may be amended at any time if there are matters that are not covered.

### Strengthening Industry Associations, Reorganization to Begin

In order to adapt to the wartime system and strengthen the organizational structure of industry associations, the Municipal Bureau of Economics has begun reorganization work based on established policies. It is conducting surveys of associations externally and audits internally. It is expected that after the adjustment and strengthening of various industry associations in the future, their superior achievements in government policy implementation and member benefits can be expected. It is understood that there are more than 240 industry associations in the city, with a total of approximately 300,000 members in industry and commerce, which indicates their importance in the city. The Bureau's survey of associations has received approximately 80-90% of the forms.

Management: Such as investigation, opinion, review, guidance, and management departments, to thoroughly improve and strengthen the personnel, institutions, and organizations of these unsound associations. The former reorganization part is being submitted to the Municipal Government for approval, while the latter management part has been handled separately according to established procedures.

### Police Bureau Holds Bureau Affairs Meeting

The Municipal Police Bureau held its tenth Bureau Affairs Meeting yesterday (13th) morning at 11:00 AM in the Bureau's building.

Deputy Directors Du Zhengjian, Lu Ying, and various Section Chiefs Man Qiwei, Hiraoka Isamu, Li Shiyu, Sugihara, Xiong Jie, Guo Shaoyi, Xiang Jiwu, Shimizu Kiyomi, and Police Chief Tsukazaki, Security Police Chief Li Yuanchu, and others attended.

### Slaughterhouse Severely Punished for Selling Diseased Pork

The Municipal Government previously received a tip that the Ningxia Road slaughterhouse was allowing carcasses of livestock and cattle with tuberculosis to be transported into the city market for sale. It ordered the Secretariat to send personnel to investigate secretly. It was found that Gu Heting, the meat inspection technician at the slaughterhouse, did indeed stamp diseased pork with a blue "Inspected" mark and allow merchants to transport it to the Qian Da Meat Shop at 181 Ningxia Road for retail sale. The Municipal Government believes that diseased livestock should be destroyed according to regulations and should not be disguised as fresh meat for consumption by citizens. The slaughterhouse technician was clearly derelict in his duties. The diseased pork was sent to the Bureau for destruction, and technician Gu Heting was first dismissed from his post, along with Zheng Lingjiu, the owner of the Qian Da Meat Shop, and ordered the Police Bureau to investigate and prosecute them according to law. As for Wang Cheng, the director of the slaughterhouse, and Chen Shunyun, the section chief in charge of meat inspection at the Bureau of Health, and Huang Guoyou, the director of the meat inspection section, who were negligent in their duties, were given a demerit. The Bureau of Health was strictly ordered to ensure that slaughterhouse inspections were carried out conscientiously and thoroughly in the future to protect the health of citizens.

Except for Yu Hengyang, Fang Cuikang, and Qian Shihua, whose involvement was less serious and were allowed to be released on bail pending further questioning, and Fang Cuikang and Qian Shihua were dismissed and forced to return their graduation certificates from the Tax Personnel Training Class, Zhao Jieren and Gao Tianyou have been transferred to the Police Bureau for further investigation and prosecution.

### Port Authority Inspects and Registers Civilian Ships

The Bureau is also preparing to issue registration certificates. Without these certificates, it will be forbidden to berth and navigate within the port area under the Bureau's jurisdiction.

### Mayor Zhou's Thoughts on the Death of Roosevelt

Regarding the death of U.S. President Roosevelt, Mayor Zhou of this city expressed the following thoughts:

Popular Morale and Morale Inevitably Decline

U.S. President Roosevelt passed away yesterday. Roosevelt had served as President of the United States for four consecutive terms, a record unprecedented in American history. As far as we usually know, eight or nine out of ten Americans have a relatively deep faith in Roosevelt. Although they recognize that Roosevelt's engagement in the war at such a significant cost is not without its doubts, it ultimately failed to diminish the hope born of their faith. At this moment when the war situation on both the European and Pacific battlefields is becoming increasingly severe, the sudden death of the head of state of the United States, coupled with the fact that American public sentiment is easily agitated and the deep faith that Americans have long had in Roosevelt, American public sentiment is bound to decline under this stimulus, especially the impact on the morale on the battlefield will be profound and great. Even the San Francisco Conference, centered on the United States and the Soviet Union, which was preparing to open with excitement in the coming days, suddenly suffered this major change, making those who are overly optimistic about this conference inevitably present a shadow in their minds.

East Asian People Deeply Vigilant However, the United States has always been a so-called democratic country, and the sudden departure of the authorities who have been in their positions for a long time does have a great impact, but it cannot be considered that national policy is about to change. Based on the great righteousness of the 1 billion people of East Asia seeking liberation together, as well as the original intention of allied participation in the war, regardless of the situation or any changes on the other side, we can only be deeply vigilant and unremittingly strive. Moving forward towards the completion of the war cannot be easily viewed with optimism and self-indulgence to slacken our fighting spirit.

### Remarks by Director Matsudaira

Director Matsudaira of the Shanghai Office of the Japanese Embassy Information Department gave the following remarks on the 13th regarding the death of U.S. President Roosevelt:

Truman Lacks Qualifications

Roosevelt had forcefully used political and diplomatic means to guide external and internal affairs. Now, although he has suddenly passed away, the United States has lost its center of gravity, and the impact on its country and the anti-Axis camp is profound and great. Truman has been promoted to President with the qualification of Vice President, but Truman is an unknown person, and his experience is quite ordinary, and his political means are even more inferior. It is expected that Churchill will definitely be disappointed. Because Truman's qualifications are not as good as Roosevelt's, it will be difficult for him to stand in a guiding position on diplomatic policy towards Britain and the United States. Furthermore, with regard to the diplomacy of other South American countries, it is also difficult to expect him to exert any authority. As for the country, it will inevitably lead to friction and confrontation in Congress, and the relationship between the government and the military and naval chiefs stationed abroad will inevitably be in an irreparable state.

American Military and Political Circles are Pessimistic

An American correspondent criticized Truman, saying that he is just an ordinary old man rising from the darkness. Therefore, the American military and political circles are pessimistic about Truman, so it will inevitably have a significant impact on the soldiers' combat spirit in the future. For the time being, the original plans of the United States may not be changed temporarily, or even supplementary institutions may be established to assist Truman's incompetence. However, we must witness the tragedy encountered by dictatorial countries, inspire our ambition, and move towards the goal of destroying the proud enemy for the independence of a new China.

### Municipal Finance Bureau Sets Deadline for Reporting and Paying Business Tax; Late Fees Will Be Added After Month-End

The Municipal Finance Bureau fully launched the city's spring business tax collection for the 34th year on April 1st. Many businesses have enthusiastically complied with the order to report and pay taxes. The tax collection offices in each district are submitting the collected tax revenue to the municipal treasury daily. However, there are still a considerable number of businesses that are hesitant, taking a wait-and-see approach, and delaying under various pretexts. It is reported that the bureau, in order to rigorously enforce tax policies and increase treasury revenue, has set the end of April as the final deadline for reporting and paying spring business tax. All spring business tax obligations must be reported and paid in accordance with regulations. If businesses miss the deadline due to their own negligence, the bureau will resolutely impose late payment penalties according to regulations. As stipulated in Article 16 of the collection regulations, a late payment penalty of 10% will be added for taxes reported and paid within ten days after the deadline, 20% for more than ten days, and suspension of business will occur for delays exceeding one month, along with the seizure of the tax due and late payment penalties. It is also understood that the Business Tax Section of the bureau completed its investigation on April 1st and immediately prepared a list, which was submitted to the bureau for dispatch of personnel for verification. It is reported that the previously established business tax collection regulations of this city are no longer applicable. After revisions, they were submitted to the Ministry of Finance for approval and then sent to the bureau for implementation. Furthermore, the bureau has made slight modifications to the tax bracket for manufacturers based on their capital amount.

### Salt Administration Bureau Adjusts Heads of Subordinate Offices

### Provisional Regulations for Registration of Prime Mover Manufacturers

The Municipal Construction Bureau believes that since the reduction in electricity supply in this city, factories have been installing prime movers for power generation. However, manufacturers installing such machinery often fail to apply to the bureau in advance, which is not in compliance with the law. Therefore, in order to standardize management, the bureau has submitted a request to the municipal government to handle the registration of prime mover manufacturers and has formulated provisional regulations, which will be announced and implemented immediately as follows:

Article 1: These regulations are formulated in accordance with Article 7 of the Shanghai Special Municipality Construction Bureau's Provisional Regulations for Handling the Installation of Prime Movers in Factories and Public Places.

### Our Army, Our People

— Koizumi Shinzo

The enemy planes' indiscriminate bombing was something we expected. As citizens, we should take responsibility, undertake all air defense work, and make it easier for the authorities to implement their policies, regardless of the size of the matter. We should all be aware that this is the only way to avenge our losses. There is no other way to punish arsonists and their masterminds.

Thoroughly Concentrate Combat Power

How should the military and the people fight? Major strategic matters are naturally left to the commanders, but one point that we laymen can also understand is that the most important thing is to thoroughly concentrate combat power. Military books say: "If you are prepared for everything, you are vulnerable everywhere." If you defend everywhere, you will be fragile everywhere. Isn't this a golden saying that we should reflect on today? Our country's combat power is definitely not abundant. If we want to use this not-so-abundant combat power to inflict a fatal blow on the enemy, the only policy is to concentrate it thoroughly in an appropriate and decisive manner. This is self-evident. However, if our people lack firm and unyielding courage, it will be impossible to realize thorough concentration. So-called concentration means focusing all attention on one point without regard for anything else. If other things are disregarded, those things that are not considered will naturally suffer great losses and harm. If the people are timid and easily shaken, the military cannot but be concerned. To enable our army and navy to implement the best strategic and tactical measures without hesitation, there must be people as solid as a rock behind them. This is what we should be aware of and remember today.

War Admits No Compromise

This war will definitely not have a compromising or eclectic ending. This has already been said repeatedly. Either we win or we perish. There is no other road besides these, and there is no other power to rely on besides ourselves. All my compatriots, no matter what, must not harbor false hopes. If we fail or surrender, we ourselves and our children and grandchildren will be forever plunged into an abyss of pain and humiliation. This point is even clearer from the enemy's public opinion. There is no room for doubt about this today. Thinking of this, what is there that we dare not do? What is there that we cannot endure? All we should do is this one thing. Simply chanting high-sounding slogans is definitely not true wisdom, let alone today is not the time to show off petty cleverness, but the time to "determination first, intelligence second," and fight together. This will surely unfold a bright road ahead of us.

Abandon Wishful Thinking

The enemy intends to carry out an amphibious landing operation on our homeland. Whether they do it or not is up to them. We only need to prepare according to what we believe.

According to the enemy's announcement, each soldier needs 16 tons of shipping for an amphibious landing operation. That is, landing 100,000 people requires 1.6 million tons, 500,000 people requires 8 million tons, and 1 million people requires 16 million tons.

How many of these ships alone will reach the coast of Japan? The Pacific Ocean is vast, and Japan's coastline is long. This vast sea is by no means a safe sea for them. This is something they also know. Torpedoes, mines, artillery shells, and bombs are all quite effective - effective when used by Japanese soldiers - and those Japanese soldiers who make them effective are rigorously trained - this is also something they should understand. However, there will always be ships that avoid being sunk. Transport ships that arrive full at our coast will disgorge their marines and soldiers. What will happen to those enemy marines and soldiers? We must not indulge in cheap or wishful thinking. Our country's survival is at stake here. The continuation of Japan's history of more than 2,600 years depends entirely on the actions of the Japanese soldiers and people who intercept the enemy troops.

The Patriotism of the Japanese People

About 20 years ago, the German scholar Emil Lederer was invited to Japan by the Tokyo Imperial University to teach economics. After his term expired and he returned to his country, he wrote a book about Japan. There was a section on the patriotism of the Japanese people, which I still remember today. He said: "Enemy soldiers may set foot on this country's land, but they will definitely not be able to leave this country alive." This is what the Japanese people firmly believe.

People know their appearance only in a mirror, and so do nations. A nation also often understands its true face only from the appearance of itself reflected in the eyes of other nations. Just as we see ourselves in a mirror and reflect on our hearts, nations often know how other countries see themselves and correct our hearts. Although Lederer's book is a thin booklet, it is a clear mirror reflecting ourselves for our compatriots. (Translated from the Yomiuri Hochi Shimbun, March 23)

War Chronicle

### Divine Tide Special Attack Corps

#### Part 1: Kikusui Unit Battle Log

On November 12th of last year, the five valiant members of the Japanese midget submarine special attack unit, the Kikusui Unit, suddenly attacked Uroshi Atoll, launching a suicide attack and sinking two standard aircraft carriers and three battleships in one fell swoop. This great feat was a bolt from the blue for the enemy fleet, inflicting a tremendous blow. This was the result of the long-trained Japanese special midget submarines, a suicide attack with guaranteed sinking. Under the boiling hot blood of youth, shouting "Banzai" and hitting and sinking enemy ships, the great road to Japanese victory was opened.

The following is the battle log of the Kikusui Unit, confirmed by the submarine captain:

The enemy aircraft carrier seen in dreams is now waiting for our valiant warriors in Uroshi. On the tempestuous Pacific Ocean, swept by seasonal winds, we sailed towards the enemy stronghold - Uroshi Atoll. Enemy large aircraft patrols became stricter by the day.

Uroshi, 1,450 miles from our homeland, served as a forward repair base for enemy ships operating in the waters off Taiwan, the naval battle off the Philippines, and the waters east of Luzon, and was also a major base for the enemy fleet. Over a hundred enemy main force transport convoys were anchored within the atoll. At 11:00 AM on November 19th, Uroshi was faintly visible in the distance, with wisps of black smoke rising. At noon, the lush coconut groves of Uroshi Atoll were clearly visible. Under cloudy skies, aircraft carriers, battleships, and other ships were anchored. One Washington-class battleship was severely listing, and another was heavily damaged, with its cannons pointing to the sky, looking quite pitiful. The captain, looking at these battleships, had fire in his eyes, wishing he could sink them all at once, but as the time was not yet ripe, he could only silently pray for the success of the brave warriors.

At dusk, as if blessed by the heavens, the sea surface near Uroshi was as calm as oil. The enemy, never imagining that we would suddenly pay a visit, had all their ships brilliantly illuminated. The lights of signal lamps flickered on and off on the bridge, and the incandescent light from the welding work being done overnight reflected from the clouds onto the sea. What a city that never sleeps! At the same time, powerful searchlights ceaselessly swept the sea and sky.

Never Forgetting the Motherland in the Moment of Death

At 3:00 AM on the 20th, the time for the first attack was near. At this moment, the submarine captain couldn't help but think of Ensign Imanishi – that hearty fellow who was eager to see enemy ships. At the same time, he also thought of Lieutenant Fukuda, who shouted "Long live the Imperial Navy! Long live His Majesty the Great Marshal!" until the moment of his death, thinking of the prosperity of the motherland and going to his death with a smile. What a noble spirit! The valiant warriors of the midget submarine special attack unit set off with this spirit, leaving only the option of turning themselves and their boats into shells, charging straight towards the enemy ships and sinking them.

At 4:16 AM, a tremendous explosion was heard from that direction, and a pillar of fire soared into the sky, the red light illuminating the heavens, and black smoke billowing. The surprise attack was a success! This was the scene when Lieutenant Nishina's boat struck a standard aircraft carrier.

The captain, gripping the periscope, couldn't help but shed tears of both sorrow and joy. Then, Lieutenant Fukuda's boat hit a Washington-class battleship, and Ensign Imanishi's boat sank a standard aircraft carrier. Lieutenants Sato and Watanabe also successively sank battleships. Uroshi Atoll instantly turned into a living hell.

The anchored lights suddenly went out all at once, leaving only the blazing pillars of fire, reddening the clouds on the horizon. (Report from the on-site reporter) (Translated from the March 26th Asahi Shimbun)

#### Part 2: Kongo Unit Battle Log

"Minatogawa Kiyoshi reflects the light of the banners, martial exploits are illustrious, flowing for ten thousand generations, beautiful Kikusui Unit, precedes me to the enemy lines!" This is the lament left behind by the valiant warriors of the second midget submarine special attack unit, the Kongo Unit. These generous and tragic warriors charged into the enemy lines on January 12th, dying alongside the enemy. Following the Kikusui Unit, the valiant warriors of the Kongo Unit also held the determination of brave warriors who would never return, and once again attacked Rōshi Atoll. They attacked Palau Island's Kersol Strait, as well as Omiya Island's Apra Harbor, and even drove straight into Hollandia in New Guinea, carrying out special underwater attacks on the enemy's five major fleet bases. Since the attack by the Kikusui Unit, the enemy's vigilance has been extremely strict, almost airtight. However, the Kongo warriors broke through their defensive lines, sank anchored enemy ships, and completed a modern miracle. When the enemy harbor sirens wailed, and the enemy scurried about in confusion, these loyal and brave warriors for the country must have ascended to heaven with a smile, dying alongside the enemy. The following is the battle log of the Kongo Unit of the Divine Tide Special Attack Corps.

Successful Surprise Attack at Uroshi

Lieutenant Tosho raised his hand and paid his respects to the north, bidding farewell to the motherland for the last time. At this time, Lieutenant Kaga, Lieutenant Motoi, and Petty Officer Fukumoto, who were also participating in the surprise attack on Uroshi, stood upright and solemn. Afterwards, after an unknown number of days, two months after the Kikusui Unit completed its mission, the Divine Tide Special Attack Corps once again visited Tori Rōshi Atoll. On January 12th, amidst the sound of the enemy patrol boats' depth charges, Captain Kaga heard a large explosion at 5:57 AM, knowing that the surprise attack had succeeded. In order to confirm the results of the Kongo Unit, the submarine boldly approached Tori Rōshi. In the periscope, they saw three battleships, eight destroyers, and over fifty transport ships, but regrettably, no aircraft carriers.

The Japanese submarine scouting the battle results naturally took great pains, but on the 11th morning, it was still inevitably subjected to several depth charge attacks by enemy patrol boats. The captain's efforts were truly indescribable. If the enemy had discovered them beforehand, the Kongo Unit warriors' attack would have been impossible. At midnight, the submarine stealthily surfaced for a look, only to see the lights of northern Tori Rōshi flickering on and off, and discovered an island nearby with ships entering the harbor with three or four lights on. At this time, an enemy plane suddenly flew out from the island. To avoid being discovered, the submarine quickly submerged.

When the Kongo Unit warriors charged in, they initially heard the sound of patrol boats speeding by, and heard the sound of depth charge attacks in the distance. There were more than twenty of them. Intermingled with these sounds were enormous explosions, which must have been the successful attacks by the warriors. Before long, Tori Rōshi Island issued an air raid alert.

Salted tofu and vinegared rice balls were the "bento" for filling their stomachs during the attack. Lieutenant Kuzumi, Ensign Ito, and Chief Petty Officer Arimori were not excited at all. They calmly carried their required items as if it were just another day of training and launched their attack. Many large transport ships were anchored in Kersol Strait, so this attack was carried out following the Kikusui Unit. Petty Officer Arimori's success was at 5:20 AM, and Ensign Ito was slightly later, at 5:25 AM. Amid the resounding explosion, the brave warriors sacrificed their precious lives for their country. The submarine responsible for confirming the warriors' achievements heard a heavy echo underwater. It must have been a large transport ship that was sunk.

Suicide Attack on Omiya Island "Hey, don't go too fast and overshoot!" Lieutenant Kudo said to Lieutenant Ishikawa, Petty Officer Mori, and Petty Officer Saegusa. He was afraid that his colleagues who were following behind would overshoot the target, so he told them to hold back. Coincidentally, Petty Officer Mori and Petty Officer Saegusa were both graduates of the aviation preparatory training class and had transferred to the Navy. Their instructor had told them: "Even if you were going to fly planes, you can still be a special attack unit that is guaranteed to hit." Thus, these two brave warriors transformed from the "Kamikaze" of the skies to the "Divine Tide" of the water.

From the attacking boat, there was a mighty cry of "Banzai!" which stirred everyone's heartstrings. The warriors brought sweets, canned goods, and ice into the boat, preparing to have a big feast along the way. They were all as happy as children.

The submarine following to check the battle results discovered Omiya Island in the mist of the 11th. Enemy planes were flying in the sky, and merchant ships were sailing on the water. The scheduled attack time was approaching. The lights on Omiya Island were dim, and the suicide attack warriors were probably advancing towards Apra Harbor in the direction of the lights. The submarine captain originally intended to surface to observe their battle results, but he had to give up because enemy planes were constantly circling in the sky. At 5:34 AM on the morning of the 12th, he looked through the periscope and saw that thick clouds covered the sky and he couldn't see where the island was, but in the direction of Apra, black smoke was billowing into the sky, and embers were still burning, proving that the warriors' attack had been successful.

Hitting Enemy Ships in Hollandia

At that time, there was a strong transport convoy anchored in Hollandia’s Humboldt Bay. It was assumed that there were also aircraft carriers and battleships there. Lieutenant Kawabunbo, Lieutenant Hara, Master Sergeant Muramatsu, Petty Officer Sato, and other warriors had received the order "Do not insult a small enemy, do not fear a large enemy" when they departed, and were single-mindedly for the country, prepared to sink to the bottom of the sea with the enemy ships.

The voyage of the warriors who made a long expedition to New Guinea, far from the homeland, was very peaceful. The accompanying submarine, on January 10th, two days before the attack, also discovered an enemy patrol plane after sunset, and broke into Hollandia’s heavily guarded defense line.

The next day, the 11th, four enemy patrol boats appeared in the dawn, all with their lights on for identification by their allies. The future of the Kongo Unit's attack was difficult to be optimistic about. Near noon, a landing transport ship and two patrol boats were spotted through the periscope. At dusk, another patrol boat was spotted, and a torpedo boat passed by at midnight. After noon on the 12th, it was assumed that the warriors had already broken into the bay. Thinking about the large number of enemy patrol boats, the submarine captain and all the crew members sincerely prayed for the warriors' success. After some time, night fell on the sea again, and suddenly a large ship with lights on was seen sailing from afar. The submarine captain, in order to respond to the Kongo Unit warriors, also decided to carry out an attack, and ordered preparations to fire torpedoes. However, when the ship approached, after careful observation, it turned out to be a large hospital ship with two funnels, and its four red crosses could be clearly seen, so they had to give up. However, one thing could be certain from this was that since a hospital ship had entered the port, there must be large warships anchored there as well. Silently waiting in the darkness until 4:55 AM in the morning, a large area of flames was seen rising from the direction of Hollandia. The Kongo Unit's hit was confirmed. Before long, a great storm arose at sea, and the flames also disappeared within it.

That evening, the personnel on the submarine lined up on the ship and silently paid their respects to the warriors who had died for the country in the direction of Hollandia. Then, they sang the third verse of "Sinking" and cheered "Banzai" to celebrate the success of the Kongo Unit's suicide attack.

### Map of Okinawa Island Situation

The decisive battle for Okinawa Island is currently underway in Naha, Shuri, Gushikawa, Tsuken Island, Nakagusuku, Nago, as well as Aka Island, Zamami Island, Tokashiki Island, Mae Island, Kuro Island, and other islands of the Kerama Islands. The Japanese army is firmly defending its positions, inflicting heavy casualties on the attacking enemy. According to a Japanese Imperial Headquarters announcement, since March 23rd, the Japanese army has sunk and damaged as many as 415 enemy ships, causing the enemy's assault forces to fall into a state of chaos. The results achieved by the Japanese army are of great significance for the victory of future operations.

### Protecting Air Raid Shelters

— Mamoruichi

Recently, the suburbs have once again been subjected to air raids, causing the work of digging air raid shelters in the city to become tense. In order to reduce the unnecessary sacrifice of life, digging air raid shelters is a matter of utmost urgency. Given the large population of this city, there must be a ditch every five steps and a shelter every ten steps to adequately meet the emergency needs of all city residents. However, if we take a stroll through the streets and examine the completed air raid shelters, we will feel dejected and wonder whether the air raid shelters have their true value during air raids? Can they adequately serve as a safe place for the citizens' lives? Although air raid shelters are not absolutely safe, are our citizens willing to seek refuge in air raid shelters during air raids? After the existing air raid shelters are completed, few pay attention to them or protect them again, causing some air raid shelters to form the following conditions:

Serving as a playground for naughty children, who run up and down, throw bricks and mud, causing the shelter to be filled with mud and rocks, and the shelter body to be damaged.

Serving as a place for beggars to hide and live, they live here, causing the shelter to be filled with rags and tattered mats, intertwined and crisscrossed. It is also regarded by citizens as a public latrine, causing foul odors to be overflowing, causing people to cover their noses.

After it rains, the low-lying air raid shelters are filled with dirty water. When the breeze rises, the turbid waves ripple, making people only recognize a pond and not a shelter.

With these conditions, once an air raid comes, how can citizens stand and hide in them? Some may think that one can't care about hygiene when seeking refuge, but it must be known that unhygienic conditions are definitely not a phenomenon that should exist in air raid shelters. Furthermore, as the weather gets hotter, if the dirt and turbid water are not cleaned, mosquitoes and flies will breed, then infectious diseases will definitely be on the rise. One more air raid shelter will inevitably be one more breeding ground for disease. So, those who protect the people are harming the people. Can this not be disheartening? Based on my limited knowledge, I propose two measures to protect air raid shelters, for the consideration of the municipal health and Baojia authorities.

Air raid shelters that are damaged or unclean should be repaired by the diggers, and the dirt, rocks, and garbage inside the embankment should be cleaned by the street sweepers. The Baojia personnel concerned should use the original fire extinguishing buckets to clear the turbid water, and then apply lime and yellow sand to make it dry quickly. When necessary, the Health Bureau should assist in disinfection.

The integrity of the air raid shelters should be taken care of by the Baojia personnel on duty, and no one should be allowed to enter and do anything that would damage the air raid shelters. In addition, warning notices should be erected or posted outside the shelters, strictly prohibiting unauthorized entry without cause. Furthermore, the police should conduct patrols at any time, and those who violate the rules should be arrested and punished.

The above two measures are not very high-minded, but are easy to implement. The relevant authorities should definitely do them well. Once the air raid shelters are not just temporary decorations, but are truly air raid shelters in name and in fact, then the citizens will be fortunate.

### Further Discussion on Improving Well Digging

— Bao Zuqi

The eighth issue of the Shanghai Municipal Affairs Journal has "Improving Well Digging Virtue", which proposes "removing the well ring, paving it with cement to form a flat surface, opening holes of appropriate size to allow buckets to go up and down and to prevent children from falling down, and installing stone covers. If economically feasible, also install water pumps." I would like to provide the following opinions for research.

Removing the well ring is more dangerous. If a stone is forgotten, then slightly larger objects are more likely to fall down.

It may be impossible to meet the conditions of opening holes of appropriate size to allow buckets to go up and down and to prevent children from falling down, because the opening of the bucket is not smaller than the child's waist. Moreover, when drawing water, too small a well opening is inconvenient.

Installing water pumps is extremely expensive, which is probably unaffordable for the average person. Moreover, pumps are very easily damaged, which is quite troublesome, and it is also inconsistent with the principle of economy.

If a wooden fence about five or six feet high is installed around the well (the public well in Siwei Village near Taixing Road uses this method), children have no need to wash clothes or vegetables, and they are absolutely prohibited from entering, which can avoid the danger of children playing and falling in or pedestrians stumbling at night.

As for the well being easily damaged, building it firmly is essential, and the residents' love for public property is especially necessary.

### Shanghai-Ningbo Junk Traffic

— Liu Feng

Travel between Shanghai and Ningbo in eastern Zhejiang is difficult because steamships do not run on a regular schedule and tickets are difficult to purchase. Therefore, junk companies have emerged. In the past, these companies mostly engaged in freight transportation between Shanghai and Ningbo, and sometimes took passengers, but most of them were acquaintances and did not care about the fare. Recently, in order to meet the needs, they have publicly sold tickets for passengers. Based on the investigation, the details are as follows:

Shanghai Junk Company - Located at No. 15 Xinjie Street, the Bund, it has four junks that run exclusively from Shanghai to Xiepu, Zhenhai. The route it takes is roughly the same as that of the large steamships, but it is closer to the coast. The departure point is the Guangxin Wharf in Yangshupu. Passengers take a small barge from the wharf and then board the junk. The barge fare is 500 yuan per person. The large junk is docked at buoy No. 26 or No. 27. After the passengers board the ship, the sails are raised and they take advantage of the receding tide to Wusong. After waiting for inspection by the water police, customs, and martial law ships in Wusong, they can go straight to Xiepu if there is a northeast wind, northwest wind, or north wind. In the best winds, it takes about sixteen to twenty hours to reach. The route it takes is: Wusong exit across Sange Water, the coast of Chongming Island, Woli Gangsha, Wai Gangsha, Liangshan to Zhenhai Port, Xiepu. Xiepu is a small town fifteen miles northeast of Zhenhai. It is a gathering place for fishermen and has inns and shops. There is a security brigade locally, and passengers must be inspected upon landing. The ticket for this route is 12,000 yuan per person. Half price for those under ten years old. Passengers must register in advance. Luggage up to 50 kilograms costs 1,500 yuan per piece. A luggage ticket must be purchased when purchasing a ticket in order to be transported onto the ship. No food is provided on the ship. You can bring your own dry food, or bring rice for the captain to cook. When disembarking, pay the captain 200-300 yuan for tea. Those who want to go to Ningbo can take a fast boat from Xiepu to Ningbo, which is forty li away. There are two trains a day, departing at 8:30 AM and 1:00 PM. The fare is 400 yuan. If you want to be comfortable, you can also take a private boat, which goes directly to the Jiangbei Bank of Ningbo. If you take the land route, you can go from Xiepu via Zhenhai to Ningbo, a total of about fifty li. There are no cars available now.

Minsheng Junk Shipping Company - There are three ticket offices: No. 685 Tiantong Road, No. 66 Father Jin Road, and Wanxing Wine Shop, Licangqiao Street, Nanshi. The ship is docked at the Guanhua Pier in Nanshi. Take advantage of the Pujiang River's receding tide to sail north to Wusong. Wait for the wind to exit. If the wind is not favorable, it will not depart. Pass Wai Tongsha, Dazhi Liangshan, Wuxingcang to Zhenhai Longshan. The fare for this route is 13,000 yuan. If you arrive early at Longshan, you don't need to stay overnight. If you arrive late, you have to stay overnight. Then take a fast boat from Longshan in the early morning via Waimen to Hetou City, about eight li away. Take a fast boat from Hetou City for four hours and forty-five li to Ningbo. The total cost of the route is 15,000 yuan. Small pieces of luggage can be carried for free. Large pieces cost an additional 2,000 yuan per piece. Currently, there is one train every other day. If there are many people, trains can be added every day. Passengers must purchase tickets in advance. As for the departure time, the company will send someone to notify them temporarily. Food must be prepared in advance, or you can bring rice for the captain to cook. Pay a tip for the wine when disembarking. There are inspections by the Zheng County security team, water police, and police near Ningbo. A fee of 500 to 1,000 yuan per person is required to avoid trouble.

Yimin Junk Company - Located at No. 22 Jiqun Guangli, Dongxin Bridge, the ship is docked at Guangxin Wharf in Yangshupu. It sails to Zhenhai. From Zhenhai, take a fast boat to Beibei. Purchase tickets in advance. The fare is 15,000 yuan. Half price for those under ten years old. The luggage limit is seven kilograms. The charge for each additional kilograms is 200 yuan. The fee for each large piece of luggage is 5,000 yuan. Passengers must provide their own meals along the way. The time of departure from Guangxin Wharf is determined by the time of the receding tide. It takes twenty hours with favorable winds to reach Zhenhai. You must give the captain a tip of less than 1,000 yuan when disembarking.

Jianrong Trading and Transportation Company - Located at No. 65A, Yongsheng Street, formerly Dongzilaihuo Street (intersection of Great Shanghai Road). The route is from the front door of the company at 8:00 AM, take a group bus (can accommodate 40 to 50 people) via Hongqiao, Beiqiao, and Luqiao to Minhang. Since there are no small steamships for transportation across the Nanhuangpu River there, the bus will end here. The whole journey is fifty li and takes about three hours. Take a fast boat from Minhang to Zhangjiajun, about sixty li away. It takes five to six hours. Take a sea boat that night and take advantage of the favorable wind to cross the Qiantang River and go straight to Linshanwei (Yao county). This sea route is 120 nautical miles. Upon arrival, passengers will automatically go to various places. Linshanwei to Yuyao county is about sixty li, Yuyao to Ningbo is about eighty li, and there are small steamships available. The company currently has two group buses and several civilian boats. However, the section from Minhang to Zhangjiajun could still use passenger cars, but now it uses fast boats. The bus departs every fifth and tenth of the month. Passengers must purchase tickets in advance. The total fare, including buses, fast boats, and sea boats, is 25,000 yuan and takes two days.

Dalian Shipping Company - Gao Nanshi Xiaobeimen Wanzhu Street No. 101, has four or five civilian boats. The larger ones can carry about a hundred passengers, and the smaller ones can carry forty to fifty people. They mainly sail in the area of ​​Andong, Yuyao, Shangyu, and Niajialu. There are several other companies that take the same route.

### Public Pawnshop Observations

— Ren Zhe

The newspaper reported that the Municipal Government of this city, for the sake of considering the welfare of the common people, has established a public pawnshop, announced regulations, and is sponsored by the Social Welfare Bureau, stipulating a monthly interest of five cents, a deadline of six months, and a maximum of 5,000 yuan per transaction. I can't help but feel fortunate for the city's salary earners. Everyone knows that the current income of salary earners is not enough for ten days of expenses. They have to cut flesh to cover wounds and have no choice but to suffer the heavy exploitation of high-interest loans. In the past, the pawnshops of the Big Together Trade in this city charged one cent per month, plus one cent and five cents for storing the box once, with a deadline of four months, not exceeding five cents per month. When the pawnshops of the Small Together Trade raised the monthly interest to two cents, plus one cent and eight cents for storing the box, the interest was equal to three cents and five cents after one month. The Big Together Trade pawnshops then stopped serving waiting patrons and closed down. Since then, the livelihood of citizens has been dwindling day by day.

According to Min, there are only seventeen pawnshops of the Big Together Trade in this city (?), and there are more than seven hundred pawnshops of the Small Together Trade (?). We hope that the municipal authorities will renovate the existing facilities and manpower of the Big Together Trade to set up public pawnshops in order to respond to light work and familiarity, and it will be easier to implement. However, it may be difficult to make ends meet with only 20 million yuan of capital for each shop. It is best to ask the Reserve Bank to borrow a large sum of money according to the example of large loans for production projects, and lend it out on a monthly basis with an interest rate of one cent. Although its nature is to passively relieve the common people, the production projects and the industrial and commercial employees related to production projects—salary earners—can obtain assistance in their livelihood and be able to work with peace of mind, and it is still a positive way to assist production.

### Clean Up the Self-Defense Pavilion

— Zhang Mengzhao

The perfection of the Baojia system and the strictness of the Baojia organization in this city have been enhanced and improved day by day after a considerable period of time and the joint efforts of the upper and lower levels. The height of the self-defense pavilion was originally the place for the self-defense team members to avoid wind and rain and to take shelter when on duty at night. However, recently, self-defense pavilions such as Ningxia Road are often occupied by street sweepers or beggars at night. The self-defense team members drive them away without cloud, and the weak teachers are insulted or turned around. Such nest-occupied magpies and small beams jumping are really not successful, not only tarnishing the appearance of the city, but also undermining the prestige of the Baojia and police. The Baojia authorities should pay attention to strictly ordering the self-defense team members to jointly inspect, and expel or detain them. After that, all the self-defense pavilions in the city should be fitted with a door and equipped with a door lock. Whoever is on duty and who is responsible, such as wearing a police baton and armband, should Dai Qing Xiaoxiao, and reforming the self-defense pavilion is an urgent matter. I hope the Baojia authorities will pay attention to it.

### The Road Home

— Chuan Wo

One

I almost didn't recognize this childhood companion. Though he had grown quite tall, he appeared extremely haggard. The black eyes hidden beneath his thick eyebrows had lost the lively sparkle of years past, and a worldly smile hung upon his lips instead.

I clasped his hand tightly. Oh, how coarse his hand was! But as we shook, I inadvertently noticed that his arm was somewhat unnatural.

"Yes, I was injured by shrapnel!" he answered sadly when I asked him. Then, he told us the story.

"Five years ago in the spring, the countryside was very unsettled. After our house was burned down, I lived with my elderly grandmother in the dilapidated ancestral hall of the Li family. One night, there was intense gunfire outside, gradually moving closer to the dilapidated hall. My grandmother and I were so frightened that we lay on the ground. But immediately, a group of people burst in, and then bullets flew into the window. I only felt a sharp pain in my arm before losing consciousness and fainting. Later, it was my grandmother who tearfully pleaded with people, and finally, with the help of a few people from Tian Village, they managed to barely treat it. But eventually, I became a cripple. I could no longer help people farm, so I had to go to the Yesei Town every day to sell pancakes and fried dough sticks. How could I properly support my grandmother like this?... Until the beginning of last year, thanks to an introduction from a distant uncle, I came to Shanghai to work as an apprentice in a machine factory..."

I didn't even know he had been in Shanghai for over a year. Shanghai, said to be a place of easy development, might this unfortunate, orphaned child who had lost his parents and elder brother, and was also struck by gunfire, be able to find a little security in his fate from now on? Of course, life as a factory apprentice is arduous, but Heaven has given him this tall body and unyielding character. Can I not believe that he will be forged stronger through hardship?

As we routinely inquired about his grandmother's well-being, his face suddenly turned ashen. He told us in a tearful voice, "Grandmother has died of illness. I have to go back immediately. But..."

I felt a kind of solidified sorrow weighing down on my heart. Speaking of death, this elderly person over seventy years old couldn't be considered too early. However, after spending her middle age wretchedly, watching her sons and grandsons die one by one, in the end, she clutched desperately at this young grandson, living by begging from others. And when the little bit of light illuminating the corner of her bleak life was almost extinguished by cruel gunfire, how many days did she soak her tears in blood! Coming to Shanghai, she shed bitter old tears of sorrow that surpassed joy. Yes, what could she use to guarantee that she could meet her grandson again? Elderly people in this situation often love their children and grandchildren more than themselves. She would have been willing to live a few more days to see her grandson succeed!

I couldn't bear to imagine the sadness of the living. But what was he going to say after his "but"? I was concerned about his future life, I couldn't help but ask him.

"Once I go back this time, I won't be able to come back to the factory anymore." This voice was more painful than when he spoke of his grandmother's death.

"More than a month ago, I received news that my grandmother was ill. I asked the boss for leave to go back. At first, he firmly refused, saying, "These few days are when we're busiest, are you intentionally trying to sabotage my business?" Later, after repeated pleading and saying that my wages would be deducted for the days of leave, he finally agreed to let me go back for a week. It was good that my grandmother didn't die that time. I hurriedly came back. But now, my grandmother has actually died. How can I not go back again? When I told the boss this time, his tone was different. "You went away for less than a month and now you want to go again, you probably don't intend to work here anymore. Now I only have two things to say to you: if you want to go back, don't bother coming back; if you still want to work here, don't even think about going back!" I said, "My grandmother died, there's no way around it." "I'm only talking about practical matters with you now, whether your grandmother dies or not is none of my business!" I immediately insisted on leaving. He calculated my wages, but after deducting the travel expenses, I'm afraid there won't be much left..."

The sinful rice bowl has been broken, but abandoning this one, what is left? For a disabled young man with no one to rely on, how small this big world is! I remember: the mountains and rivers of my hometown are beautiful, the land of my hometown is vast; the soil contains treasures of life, wild grasses of abundance blow on the ridges, the fields of my hometown nurture millions of children, but also freeze and starve another group. The land has been occupied by a few people, rice and wheat and firewood are piled into the granaries of the wealthy; what's more, many mountains and fields have been leveled into wasteland, many villages have been destroyed into ruins. What can a person without land get from his hometown? Especially an honest person who is physically incomplete!

"This kind of boss is really unreasonable. This time you lost your job, it can't be blamed on you. Go back to the countryside and work hard, it should always be easy for a young man to support himself, right?" my father comforted him this way.

"Yes, that's what I think too, but when I think about not even having a piece of land or a house, I feel a bit daunted in my heart!"

In the end, he left silently and bewildered.

Two

The early autumn evening breeze carried me back to my hometown.

Wandering about my long-separated home, I particularly missed Ying.

One cold morning, I met him.

I almost didn't recognize this friend I had seen five months before! He was wearing tattered clothes, with a large hole in his short trousers, embarrassingly exposing his thigh. His bare feet were red-black and cracked, and his thin, sallow face showed the abuse his body had suffered from life. New and old grief and bitterness accumulated in those eyes, and the dust of melancholy stained the jet-black pupils. Of course, the worldly smile on the corner of his mouth had also been replaced by tearless sorrow.

He had become even less talkative than before. Perhaps, deceptive words were originally unnecessary for him: he couldn't beg for pity from the strong, he couldn't intimidate the weak, and he was unwilling to seek help from relatives!

If I were a wealthy fellow villager of his, he certainly wouldn't have come to see me. Because I was his poor friend, and he understood my character, he unashamedly told me about his experiences in the past four or five months in an enthusiastic tone and clumsy language.

He began to live by raising a sickle and carrying a shoulder pole. But he didn't have his own mountain land, he could only look for ownerless wild land to cut firewood, and his right hand couldn't use the sickle. However, mountain land didn't have clear boundaries, and powerful people could forcibly claim wild land as their own. Thus, he had to run into the remote mountains at night. Unfortunately, he was seen by the hired hand of Zhang Shunye once. As a result, when he was laboriously carrying firewood towards the town in the light of the early morning, he was surrounded by a group of people. They said he was stealing firewood, detained him at Zhang Shunye's house, confiscated the load of firewood, and gave him a beating. Since then, everyone knew that he was a penniless destitute, so they guarded against him particularly. So he was hungry several times. Under the inhumane torment he had never experienced, he finally fell ill. He groaned in the dilapidated ancestral hall, and no one came to take care of him. Eventually, his sister found out and secretly came to see him when she had time, giving him a few liters of rice, but she was immediately found out by her mother-in-law, who scolded her severely. During the autumn harvest, he supported himself, wanting to do odd jobs for people, but no one wanted him because his right hand was inconvenient, he couldn't thresh rice, winnow rice, or shell rice. But finally, the Wang Genfa family was short-handed, so they asked him to herd cattle and carry water for them for a few days during the busy farming season, giving him a bowl of rice to eat.

Seeing that it was now the time when the new rice harvest was ending, Ying would lose his "temporary rice bowl" again, the road ahead was vague, how should he know how to walk...

"I regret that I refused the boss that time..." he ended his complaint like this, lowering his head powerlessly.

"When there's really no way, I'm going to leave my hometown. Let me die, I have no more worries." These were the words of lament when he and I parted, and they fell heavily in my heart.

Yes, people abandoned by sinful people may be able to do something truly glorious for humanity. I bless him that he will soon embark on a new road. And I believe: his steps will be forever firm, his eyes will be forever forward!

### Cigarette Butt Fire

— Xia Ru

In the rainy alley at night, there is a spark of light,

Flickering dimly, struggling in the mud, a wisp of green smoke twisting, life is struggling.

The muddy smoke, the footprints of jumping shoes are blurred,

The night walker's feet are far away,

Leaving behind the loneliness of the late night.

Perhaps chewing on the shattering of dreams,

Even more the twilight's end. In the rainy alley at night, I

Tremble in contemplation, unafraid, there is a

Remaining cigarette butt fire upstairs.

### Little Cloud

— Shang Zhu

"Last night, when the night was deep and quiet, a sudden surge of sorrow gripped me, for no reason, yet seemingly for many reasons. I even thought about destroying myself," Sima Ru said to his friend, on a day when the weather was too good to breed seeds of sorrow.

"I felt lonely, so I stopped working and started to think. The world felt very far away from me. What I want is not formal people, but the sympathy of people with feelings. I used to love loneliness, but last night I felt fear of loneliness. I was sad all night; today I still carry the lingering sadness."

Sima Ru looked up at the sky, surveying himself and the surrounding scenery bathed in the warm sunshine. The sun revealed the smile of spring, but Sima Ru had the sorrow of spring. Waiting for no response, he looked at his friend's blank face, blaming her in his heart for her naiveté, for not understanding the life of thought.

"I don't know how I conjured up this idea," he continued, as if speaking to himself. "It came as suddenly as an acute illness. I, so young, would be content with my short life. Thinking of killing myself."

"You probably encountered something unpleasant. Or love has abandoned you," his friend said.

"Love is the only thing in the hearts of vulgar people."

"Then, loneliness in friendship?"

"Right, maybe I'm sad about the lack of friendship."

"Or the loss of friendship?"

"Friendship will not be lost: I have long had its lack, but I was content, not realizing it. Once discovered, it is as empty as if it were lost. The feeling of emptiness is the source of loneliness."

Sima Ru said, sighing deeply. He looked into the distance, this empty ground, far, far away, without a single person in sight, the empty sky, far, far away, without a single cloud. But this was not a bright and satisfying feeling, emptiness filled his heart.

"You can cry a bit," his friend said.

"I want to cry, but how can I cry? I, I, I think of myself, and the tears won't come out. I am very sad, but a lonely person lets himself know his loneliness. A complacent person will not feel lonely."

"You insulted your friend."

"Why?" Sima Ru asked.

"You say in front of your friend that you lack friendship, aren't you ashamed?"

"What I hate is myself. My heart has never been lively, now I seem to need liveliness."

"Sima Ru, you speak too circuitously!" his friend shouted.

Sima Ru gave a wry smile, as if an unavoidable answer, as if representing the act of nodding. He leaned against a tree trunk that was not yet full and long, looking at the cloudless sky; he used to love to watch the changing clouds, to them, he made all kinds of boundless speculations, sometimes letting a fleeting cloud; carry the burden of his soul, his thoughts, his reminiscences flying far away. This was an interesting amusement. Now, Sima Ru hoped that a white thing would rise in the distance, carrying away his heart full of sorrow.

"What are you thinking?" his friend asked anxiously and happily, under the beauty of the spring sky.

Sima Ru responded, falling from the cloudless sky, he searched for support. On his friend's plump smiling face, her youthful vitality, Sima Ru found that white, frivolous cloud.

The little cloud carried away Sima Ru's sorrow.

"Why don't we let ourselves enjoy spring!" Sima Ru grabbed his friend's hand, skipping and jumping, and ran straight towards the empty wilderness; that distant place, that spring distant place, that distant spring! —Chapter of Spring—

### Husband and Wife

— Yuan Ying

If you are happy, and can still have some free time under the heavy pressure of life's hardships, could I please ask you to sit down for a while, and let me finish telling you this ordinary story?

The protagonists of the story are a pair of university students, my friends. The man wore a mortarboard, — there is still a photo hanging in their room, taken at graduation. — The woman studied Western literature for two years, and could recite a bit of Shakespeare.

They got married last year.

Lao Xi, that guy who wore the mortarboard, relied on a relative, and luckily grabbed the job of a small clerk in an insurance company from a large group of partners who sighed at their diplomas. Although he initially studied education, knowing only about motivation, IQ, and Normal Curve, running into the insurance company seemed a bit incompatible, but people still envied him, just like Lao D, who expressed:

"Lao Xi is really promising, he has a way out as soon as he leaves school."

As for the other one, Miss Sun Lan, for the sake of marriage, she had no choice but to abandon Shakespeare and sixty-odd credits, to wash clothes, light a stove, and cook.

The old classmates all considered them a happy family, although some seemed to think it would be even better with a child or a violin, but let's not worry about that, there is no such thing as perfection in the world, is there?

However, Lao D ran over to tell me that this couple had quarreled.

"What's the big deal about quarreling?" I said, with worldly wisdom, "Household matters, nothing to be alarmed about."

"But this time it's quite serious." Lao D shook his head: "Sun Lan, in a fit of anger, stayed outside for three days without going home, leaving our education bachelor to worry anxiously at home, eating plain noodles for dinner."

"Why did they quarrel?"

"I don't quite understand, I heard there were some romantic entanglements."

"Romantic entanglements?" I was taken aback, "I don't believe it! Our education bachelor is a gentleman, upright and proper, he wouldn't."

"I'm not very sure either, this is just news from semi-official sources." Lao D smiled. So I decided to visit them once. That "happy family" was on a fake fourth floor, the roof was not high, you could touch the ceiling with a stretch of your hand. I was very familiar with this house, I was the one who accompanied Lao Xi to see the house for the first time, and after the owner of the house got married, I was also a frequent guest. To be honest, I could recite with my eyes closed who's landscape painting was hanging on the wall, what scattered small objects were placed on the windowsill, and what photos were pressed under the glass plate that was cracked into three pieces.

Lao Xi, the education bachelor, was lying on the bed. I came in, but he didn't get up.

"What's the trick? You're quarreling again for no reason." I sat down by the bed.

He sighed and shook his head. After a long time, he hummed a sentence:

"Lao Yuan! It's really meaningless to be a human being."

"Come on! Stop complaining." I stopped him: "What's the matter? We've been friends through thick and thin for five or six years, is there anything you can't say? I didn't come to hear you sigh."

He considered getting out of bed, took out half a pack of cigarettes, and gave me one.

"I heard from Lao D that there seems to be some romantic entanglements, is that right?" I took a puff of smoke, looking at him: "But, I know that Lao D likes to exaggerate deliberately, for fear that the world won't be chaotic. What exactly is it?"

The matter turned out to be very simple. There was a female colleague in Lao Xi's company, in the accounting department, Shanghainese call these Misses "vases". But as I said before, our education bachelor is a proper person, so of course he wouldn't be like others, taking people as real decorations in the writing room, and, to be honest, he did have such an ambition, to "educate" this Miss well.

Going back and forth, I don't know how it happened. One day, coming from the writing room, they — Lao Xi and that Miss — were seen by Sun Lan on the streetcar. That little girl who was familiar with Shakespeare had her share of strong emotions. As soon as she got home, she couldn't help but shed tears. She lay on the bed crying sadly, even ignoring Lao Xi when he came back.

The next day —

"The next day, she went out early." Lao Xi paused, then continued: "She went out early, without saying a word, and didn't come back."

"Do you know where she is?"

"Lao Xi said she's at Xiao Xu's house. I called her, and she didn't deny it."

"So what are you going to do?" I asked: "I can take a trip for you."

"I don't plan to do anything, I just want to explain. What needs to be said, I've told you in detail, whether you believe it or not is up to you, whether you tell her or not is also up to you."

I went to Xiao Xu's house.

"Coming to be a peacemaker for Lao Xi, right?" Xiao Xu opened the door for me.

"Just want to be a peace envoy." I smiled: "Is Sun Lan doing well these two days?"

"Good! — Complaining for a while, reminiscing about old dreams for a while, and then teary-eyed again."

I walked upstairs with Xiao Xu.

Sun Lan greeted me with a long tirade again.

"Miss, I just came from listening to a bellyful of complaints. I said, "Both of you seem to have a lot to say, all regretting, sighing, but why do you still want to quarrel?"

I didn't repeat what Lao Xi told me, it would be more interesting for Lao Xi to tell her these things himself later, right?

An hour later, I jumped onto a rickshaw with her. Xiao Xu saw us off, saying to me:

"If she runs out again in the future, I'll look for you, this peace envoy!"

Along the way, Sun Lan still couldn't express her bitterness, she kept recounting how Lao Xi always worked until eight or nine o'clock before coming back, making people wait anxiously for dinner, and how their finances were always tight. Once, in order to attend an old classmate's wedding banquet, she discussed with Lao Xi, planning to buy a pair of leather shoes, but Lao Xi only said:

"What time of year is this? What are you doing?"

"What he said is indeed not wrong." Sun Lan said to me: "But also appearance, what does he know every day to make the shirt bright and shiny, the suit pants pressed straight under the pillow?"

I should be surprised that in the year since their marriage, life has changed this Miss of Western Literature to this point.

"That's good." I thought: "It's good for her to be tempered a bit. A flower in a greenhouse cannot withstand wind and rain."

Arriving at the fake fourth floor where you could touch the ceiling with a stretch of your hand, Lao Xi was still lying on the bed, smoking. Smoke filled the room. I opened the window, letting the spring evening breeze in.

Sun Lan didn't say a word. — Just like her name, she was originally a quiet person. — As soon as she entered the door, she first sat blankly by the table for a while, finally rolled up her sleeves, bent down, planning to light the stove.

I looked at Lao Xi, he sat up.

"I'm sorry. Lan —" He walked behind her: "These days, for the sake of life, I haven't been taking care of you."

Sun Lan didn't answer, lowering her head, tears falling.

Should this be the time for me to say goodbye?

"Okay." Then she stood up to me: "Life comes first. Stop making those young master and young miss kinds of scene!"

"Aren't you going to stay for dinner?" Sun Lan raised her tear-streaked face.

"Don't be polite. I'll come again after the rain. Good night:" I bowed to the couple of young people.

The story ends here, I'm sorry if it disappoints you, the story is not pleasing at all, is it? It has no twists and turns, no beautiful descriptions. No, it doesn't even have a surprising ending. But, sir, I said before, don't blame the author, this was originally an ordinary story, an ordinary story.

### Dusk

— Tian Ying

Whose cooking smoke is rising, the

Weary flock of birds towards their nests.

Carrying a body of hard-earned dust,

The homeward-bound person quietly steps into the door;

In the distance, there is again the clear call of a mother summoning her child.

### Falling Cold

— Tian Ying

The night sky is full of stars,

At the distant edge of the sky,

Suddenly, a shadow of fire appears - is it a small star?

Suddenly it falls.

### Commentary on the First Two Matches of the Charity Basketball Game: Tonight, Hualian and Giant Clash

The Nanshi International Relief Hospital and the Nanshi Baoli Hospital, in order to raise funds for the two hospitals, specially entrusted Zhang Huixiang, general manager of Hualian Pharmaceutical Factory, to organize three charity basketball games, held on the 10th, 12th, and 14th of this month at the fitness room of the Eight Immortals Bridge Youth Association. The first and second matches have already been played, and the last match will be held tonight.

According to these three matches, Hualian is solely responsible, and borrowed players from the Zhongbei Shantou team to compete against the Westerner Monroe and the Giant team. In this basketball season, which has already passed its peak, this grand gathering of Chinese and Western basketball stars is a feast for the eyes of fans. Here is a supplementary review of the previous two games and a discussion of tonight's battle.

### Monroe Team Lightly Defeats Hualian in the First Match

The first act of the charity game was held on the 10th, with Hualian borrowing players from the Shantou team to form a mixed army against Monroe. As a result, Hualian unfortunately lost with a score of seventeen to thirty.

The reason why Monroe won was entirely due to their use of their height to follow up under the basket as a shortcut to scoring. The tall man Fu Weike was the main figure. On the Hualian side, they failed to pay attention to this. The guards were unable to use a guard with a good jump to stop him, so they were outmaneuvered, and their failure was justified. Speaking of Hualian, they hastily joined forces with the Shantou team, without careful study beforehand, and went on the court doing their own thing, so that it was all individual performances, with very little cooperation. On the other hand, the entire Monroe team were comrades belonging to one team. How can Hualian win? Therefore, to summarize this game, it was the expected result.

### After Half-Time, Careful Reorganization Leads to Hua Lian's Ultimate Victory

The second match, held on the 12th, saw Shan Hua Lian once again borrow soldiers from Zhong Bei to bolster their strength and face Monaco. Before the game, there was an interlude: a contest between the "Fat Team" and the "Old-Timers." The Old-Timers were a newly emerging formidable team, managed by Shan Wang Zhongtao and Zhang Yunxiang. Their team members were limited to those 36 years of age or older, to better suit the "Old-Timer" moniker. The Fat Team was also a peculiar team, carefree and contented. Although their players were large and clumsy, their skills were deep, and their recent practice had been diligent, so their performance was improving steadily. The Old-Timers were also formidable warriors of the past. The two teams' competition emphasized entertainment over victory, with many humorous moments that fulfilled the original purpose of the match. In the end, the Fat Team won 26-20 due to their greater experience. Examining the Old-Timers, aside from Kong Guangyi and Yu Yuzi, Wang Zhongtao, Zhang Yunxiang, and Wang Shoufang were past their prime, but their skills remained. If these veterans had the opportunity to practice, they could still dominate in second-tier teams. One wonders if the Old-Timers would be interested in that.

Concerning Hua Lian's victory over Monaco in the second match, there was significant consideration beforehand. Having learned from their defeat in the first match, Zhang Yunxiang not only borrowed Ma Canxi from the Shan team but also borrowed Li Zhenzhong, Chen Xuechong, Zhuo Guorong, and Bao Songyuan from Zhong Bei. This ensured ample options for management. It was regrettable that Zhenzhong couldn't attend due to other commitments.

Ultimately, Hua Lian, blessed with abundant talent, narrowly won 25-24 by a single point. The key to Hua Lian's victory was their defense. Ma Canxi, Zhuo Guorong, and Bao Songyuan were excellent in their own ways, especially in rebounding. All three had mastered the timing of jumping and intercepting, preventing Monaco from following up rebounds and scoring, which proved decisive. Xu Jusheng and Zhang Liangxiong were the most successful scorers for Hua Lian and deserve recognition. However, in the final minutes, Jusheng wasted too many opportunities, and Liangxiong loosely guarded Botto, almost allowing Monaco to overtake them, demonstrating a lack of composure. Although Monaco lost, their increasingly spirited performance and ability to use their bench effectively to disrupt Hua Lian's morale, especially after their main player was penalized, were commendable.

### Tonight's Match Is Bound to Be Exciting

Tonight marks the final match, with the same Hua Lian lineup from the second game facing the foreign giant, the Giant team. A women's match will be added before the main event. Let's briefly discuss both matches tonight.

### The Three Provinces Team and Yi Kang Team Are Evenly Matched

The women's warm-up match will start at 7:30 PM, featuring a contest between the Three Provinces team and the Yi Kang team. Originally, there were plans to have the Green team participate, but their strength was too great, making it difficult to find a suitable opponent. Therefore, the Three Provinces team and Yi Kang team were invited.

The Three Provinces team is the league's runner-up. Since Chen Zuoliang became their coach, they have made rapid progress, especially in their defense. Chen Liuzhen's remarkable improvement deserves special mention. The Yi Kang team is a new force trained entirely by Wu Zibin. Their ability to follow rules and apply tactics is commendable. However, in my opinion, their inability to reach the pinnacle is due to their rigidity. Methods are fixed, but application requires adaptability. Players are not machines, so one cannot expect them to always perform as expected. If Yi Kang can be more flexible, they will achieve even greater things. As for the key to tonight's match, Deng Xiuchun of Three Provinces should avoid taking aimless shots that waste possession. Their forwards are skilled, so there are ways to attack. Defensively, they should avoid fouls, as Yi Kang's forwards often obstruct and dodge opponents, leading impatient players to commit unnecessary fouls. If they are cautious, Three Provinces can win. For Yi Kang to win, they need to be more lively. If so, they might win by five or six points. Overall, the two teams are closely matched, promising an exciting game.

### The Giants Are Cunning; How Will Hua Lian Handle Them?

The Giants have been quiet for a long time, but their reputation is admired by fans. Zhang Yunxiang's efforts led to the Giants' willingness to participate, adding much to the charity event.

The Giants are stronger than Monaco, focusing on stability. Players like Kai Jie, Ning Luofu, Tao Bolinji, and the Sasi Jin brothers are intelligent and resourceful, employing various tactics to exploit weaknesses and maximize strengths.

### Hoping Li Zhenzhong Will Bravely Help Out

Hua Lian will use the same lineup as the second match. Everyone hopes that Li Zhenzhong, who was absent last time, will be able to participate. Regardless of the outcome, his presence will make the game more exciting.

In my opinion, Hua Lian's ideal lineup would be Ma Canxi, Zhuo Guorong, and Bao Songyuan on defense, and Li Zhenzhong, Chen Xuechong, Zhang Jinxuan, Xu Jusheng, and Zhang Liangxiong on offense. With these eight players, the performance would be excellent, and the coach would have many options. Just imagine, with any two of these three defensive players, rebounding would be worry-free. How could the Giants handle that? With Zhenzhong's intelligence to assist from the front line and his height to follow up, the other players would have plenty of scoring opportunities, leading to success.

Furthermore, Zhang Yunxiang should work with Wang Zhongtao and Dai Changling to direct and strategize from the sidelines. I dare say Hua Lian would have a 70% chance of winning.

Tickets for tonight's game cost 2,000 yuan, which seems expensive, but all proceeds will be donated to charity, and the expenses will be borne by the Shan Hua Lian Pharmaceutical Factory. We admire Hua Lian's financial and physical contributions and hope enthusiastic fans will attend and support the good cause. (Xian)

Zhong Bei Team Wins Open Basketball Championship (Kang Zuyi Photo)

### A Record of the Wedding of Yan Weiwen, Main Player of the Green Team

— Mei Jie

I mentioned in the last issue that Miss Yan Weiwen, the main player of Shanghai's women's basketball champion team, the Green Team, was getting married. Yesterday, I received an invitation from Miss Yan and attended the wedding, which was held at the Garden Restaurant at 4:00 PM yesterday (the 13th).

I arrived around 4:00 PM. Upon entering, I was surrounded by unfamiliar men and women, and I felt quite awkward. Perhaps because I don't socialize much, I stood there for a couple of minutes until a young man who looked familiar came to greet me. I learned that he was a player from the Skeleton basketball team and a neighbor of Miss Yan. He invited me to sit down.

Members of the Green Team Arrive One After Another

First, I saw Li Yunzhi, Yang Wenjuan, and Xiang Yulin arrive in spring outfits as bright and colorful as the bride's. Soon after, I saw Qian Xucang, Xie Yiqin, and Wang Wanggan arrive, which eased my discomfort. Amidst Xucang's witty remarks, Wang Yinlan, Huang Mingyuan, Zhu Shimao, Liu Zhenbao, and Wang Weizhen arrived. It was said that Zhang Minzhi was filming on location and Huang Xingfen couldn't make it due to other commitments. I noticed that Rong Shulun was missing, and I inquired about her.

Miss Rong Serves as the General Manager

I was told that Miss Rong was in charge of coordinating with the Garden Restaurant. This was because Miss Rong had connections there. She was entrusted with the task and took care of every detail, busy arranging everything. She truly deserved the title of "General Manager." I also learned that she was upstairs helping the bride get ready, which was why she was not present.

The Wedding Ceremony Was Full of Sweetness

The wedding ceremony was simple and grand, but because the bride was smiling the whole time, especially on this joyous occasion, I never saw her stop smiling, her pearly white teeth always showing. The groom, Mr. Yuan, had a dark complexion and a standard physique. He looked like a young athlete. I learned that he was also a cheerful person. Therefore, during the wedding, all I saw was the couple smiling. Zhu Shifang said, "Weiwen has the nickname 'Sweet Girl,' so the groom should be called 'Sweet Boy.'" Indeed, the wedding ceremony was full of "sweetness."

Lin Kanghou Competes to See the Sweet Girl

Amidst the cheerful wedding laughter, I caught a glimpse of Lin Kanghou standing at the back, craning his neck to see the bride. Mr. Kang had a separate banquet upstairs and stopped by to see the "Sweet Girl."

Observations During Tea and Snacks

After the wedding ceremony, the guests surrounded the newlyweds and showered them with confetti as they went up the escalator. Then, tea and snacks were served. Xucang quietly slipped away. Zhu Yinlan also left without a word. I sat with the entire Green Team at one table, except for Liu Zhenbao, who was chatting with some old friends from the former Qiuxiu Women's Basketball Team, including Li Baoqiu (still with an athletic air), Li Wenbao (who seemed thinner), and Yang Feibi (who was more slender and charming than before). The Skeleton basketball team sat at the next table, as the bride's younger brother, Yan Jiliang, was also a member of that team.

Almost Mistook Him for Fan Qinggong

Yan Jiliang's features resembled Fan Qinggong of Hua Lian so much that when Mr. Yan, as the master of ceremonies, accompanied the bride down the aisle to the music, I almost mistook him for Fan Qinggong.

Next Wedding Banquet Should Be for Rong and Yang

While chatting, I mentioned that this year seemed to be the year for female athletes to get married: Huang Xingfen, Shi Ruijuan, Wu Zhenxiong, and Yan Weiwen today. Huang Daoyuan immediately reported that after Weiwen, it should be Shujun and Wenjuan. Rong and Yang looked embarrassed but silently acquiesced.

The Green Team Will Continue to Work Hard

The Green Team is the dominant force among women's teams. Because of the weddings, many people have speculated that the team might break up. However, at the banquet, they all said that they were determined to continue working hard and improve their skills. The team's manager, Wang Wanggan, promised to give each player a new jacket as encouragement. The entire team thanked Mr. Wang. Therefore, I hope that when the Green Team plays in the future, they will have new uniforms and improved skills to show the Shanghai basketball community.

Miss Yan Weiwen

### On Badminton (1)

— Chang

The Appeal of Badminton

Many young people are used to playing soccer, basketball, and tennis, and they think of badminton as a game for women. They think that the light racket, the light shuttlecock, and the small court are not enough for vigorous young men to play. They think that even if they play it, they won't find it very interesting. So many young people look down on this game! But it is not appropriate to be dogmatic about things that one has not experienced. As the ancients said, "One does not know the difficulty without having experienced it." You have to experience it yourself to know whether it is difficult or not. Whether it is interesting or not also depends on how deep your experience is. For example, learning to swim. Beginners not only find it uninteresting but also feel a lot of discomfort. Water gets into your ears, making loud noises. Water gets into your eyes, making them sting. How difficult! What's so interesting about that? But to those who can swim, it is very interesting, the best kind of fun. Because when you jump into the water and dive deep down, you become like a fish, moving forward and backward, turning left and right, so free and at ease. In the glassy world, you can see all kinds of things. The most interesting thing is to meet your swimming buddies and look at each other's faces in the water, which become either long or short, fat or round, wide or large. Ah! It's really strange. How can friends who can't swim know about the pleasures of swimming, like "a fish in water"? How can people who have never played badminton know about the pleasures of badminton? If you have played badminton a few times, then you might be able to appreciate some of the fun of the game. The most interesting thing about badminton is to make your opponent run, and if they run but can't catch the shuttlecock, then you win a point. When you win a point, or win a game, you feel as happy, as rich, and as victorious as if you had won the lottery, made a fortune, or won a battle. If you win a point with a fierce attack, you can secretly enjoy the pleasure of triumph. If the opponent hits the shuttlecock very fiercely and dangerously, and you can save it from danger and hit it over the net, not only will the onlookers applaud and cheer, but your own happiness will be greater than winning gold or a beautiful woman. If a game has ended, no matter who wins or loses, you will be covered in sweat and out of breath. Resting at this time is like a worker resting under the shade of a tree after work, enjoying a cup of tea, which is as good as being king.

The Benefits of Badminton: Easy to Sweat

The most beneficial thing about playing badminton is that it is easy to sweat out toxins. Sweat is a necessary excretion from the body. Sweat is acidic, containing sodium, dihydrogen phosphate, and other substances, similar to urine. Sweat is smelly because it emits fatty acids from the body, which taste alkaline.

If sweat contains other substances and accumulates in the body, it will affect the kidneys, and you will feel uncomfortable immediately. Symptoms such as headaches, fever, and stuffy nose will appear, because the skin and kidneys are very closely related. More urine means less sweat, and more sweat means less urine.

### Veteran Soccer Players

— Lao Niu

Twenty-six or twenty-seven years ago, soccer in Shanghai was only played in schools. The matches between St. John's University and Nanyang University were the most exciting, with crowds of 10,000 people at each game. The students from both schools organized cheering squads, singing school songs and victory songs, with gongs, drums, and firecrackers, which was a different kind of excitement compared to today's soccer matches. The forward for St. John's University was Shen Siliang, the current chairman of the Shanghai Football Association, whose shots were accurate. The defender was Yu Hengzhi, who was good at marking players, keeping a close eye on the opposing team, loyal, brave, and had endurance. He was known as "Old Niu" (Old Ox). After graduating, he worked as the manager of the Donghua team in his spare time for a long time before going to Qingdao. During the war, he traded in foreign stocks in Shanghai. Three years ago, he returned to Qingdao and is now running a store there, which is going well. (Yun · Leda Guan)

### Reasons for the Chinese Team's Failure in the International Cup Semifinals

In the International Cup semifinals held at the rubber plantation last weekend, China played against Italy. The winner would not only gain the right to the finals but also have absolute confidence in their chances for the championship. After all, the other team in the finals was from Northern Europe, whose strength was no match for China and Italy.

The Chinese players were determined to win this match, but after fighting hard for ninety minutes, they were defeated 2-1 due to a lack of skill, losing the chance to compete for the International Cup. I still remember last year when Lai Donghua was at the height of his power, storming the enemy camp and winning the championship. This scene is still vivid in my mind. After only one season, the title was lost to foreigners. It makes me feel depressed to write about this.

Four Players Penalized

The main reason for China's defeat was the absence of Jia Youliang, Han Longhai, Li Yao, and Wu Qixiang, who were penalized. In the Chinese team, there were few players who could compare to Youliang and Li Yao on the left and right wings. Longhai's pace was unmatched in Shanghai, and Wu Qixiang was the best right-back in the city. The loss of these four key players was devastating, and this was the primary reason for China's defeat.

Poor Strategy

The second reason was the poor strategy. I have repeatedly criticized Song Lingsheng's attempt to pair him with Li Ning as defenders. Song is agile, while Li is slow, leading to inevitable gaps. This allowed the Italian team to attack on the right wing and score two goals. Since they were taking the risk of moving Song to the left, why not try Xin Fuji, who would have been more reliable? I still don't believe that the old Xin cannot be a forward, just as I don't understand why A Dai isn't playing forward.

Lack of Practice

Furthermore, Li Yichen was completely unable to perform, making it difficult for him to even move on the field. This was unexpected. I learned that Li was traveling between Shanghai and Chongming and didn't have time to practice, so we cannot blame him. However, this shows the importance of practice in soccer. One cannot rely on fame alone to win.

Although the Italian team won thanks to a penalty kick, they had improved in terms of tactics and endurance. Their forwards showed caution in their passes, and their use of breakthroughs was improving. Although they were not always successful, they posed a significant threat to China. I feel that the Italian forwards have unlimited potential if they can further improve their intelligence and passing skills and practice their shooting skills.

The Italian defense was truly like an impenetrable wall. Their players were tough and strong, and they each fulfilled their roles, making it difficult for the opposing team to attack. However, the Italian defense lacked creativity. If they could be tricked with skillful short passes, they could be attacked effectively. Unfortunately, the Chinese players were hastily assembled, a disjointed group. They had the will but lacked the strength.

Since China has been defeated, we can only watch as the championship falls into the hands of foreigners. We hope that next year, we can once again show our strength on the soccer field. (Jia)
