### Commander-in-Chief He Returns to Zhijiang; Issues Statement Before Leaving Shaanxi; Will Personally Go to Nanjing to Accept Japanese Instrument of Surrender

Xi'an, 28th – Commander-in-Chief He departed from here on a special plane at 9:05 AM on the 28th to return to Zhijiang. Hu Zongnan, Sun Lianzhong, Zhu Shaozhou, Gu Zhengding, Feng Qinzhai, and more than 30 senior US Air Force generals saw him off at the airfield.

Xi'an, 29th, 5:00 AM – At 6:30 AM on the 28th, Commander-in-Chief He met with more than ten reporters in the reception room next to the Provincial Government’s Zhongzheng Hall. After an introduction by Chairman Zhu, Mr. He shook hands with the reporters in a very excited and happy mood and answered their questions as follows: (1) Will the Commander-in-Chief personally go to Nanjing to accept the formal surrender of Japan, and has the date of the surrender ceremony been decided? Answer: I will personally go to Nanjing to accept the formal instrument of surrender from Japan. The date will be determined after General MacArthur accepts the overall surrender document from Japan to the Allied nations, probably in early September. (2) Can you tell us the purpose of the Commander-in-Chief's inspection of the Northwest this time? Answer: I came here to give instructions to the commanders of various war zones regarding matters related to accepting the surrender of the Japanese army. (3) Will the receiving troops in Hebei, Shandong, Jehol, and Chahar provinces mainly rely on air transport? Answer: The number of troops is large, and we will use all means of transportation to transport them separately. (4) In major cities, especially Beiping and Tianjin, is it possible for the receiving troops to encounter obstacles, and how will we deal with them if we encounter obstacles? Answer: I don’t think we will encounter any obstacles. (5) Will the US military land in Tianjin, Yantai, Qingdao, and other places immediately? Answer: The location and time of the US military landing cannot be announced yet. (6) Regarding the reception of the three northeastern provinces, what preparations have we made? According to the Sino-Soviet agreement, the Soviet army is limited to the three northeastern provinces. It is reported that the Soviet army has arrived in Dolon and Chengde. What is the Commander-in-Chief's observation on this? Answer: Regarding this point, if you read the record of the Sino-Soviet agreement on the relationship between the Soviet army and the Chinese administration in the three northeastern provinces in yesterday's newspaper, you will understand the spirit of openness and sincerity of the Soviet Union towards our country. (7) It is said that the Communist troops are marching rapidly towards North China. Is this true? What is their intention? Answer: There is such information. Their intention is, I think, even clearer to you than to me. (8) What kind of measures will the central government take against the Eighteenth Group Army for disobeying orders? Answer: The central government has always adopted a lenient policy towards the Eighteenth Group Army. Although the army is currently disobeying the orders of the commander-in-chief, the central government still adheres to its consistent policy and hopes to correct the situation through political means to prevent the people from suffering further disasters and hindering the construction and restoration of the country. At this time, after eight years of arduous struggle and deep wounds, all compatriots across the country are eager for domestic peace and stability. The Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, the United States, and other major allied nations are sincerely assisting our country, hoping that our country will become a unified and strong nation and jointly safeguard world peace. I believe that the officers and soldiers of the army are all Chinese citizens and will not persist in going against the will of the people and the hope of friendly nations, thereby increasing the suffering of their compatriots. Finally, Mr. He also stated: The Japanese army currently on the Chinese battlefield, excluding the Northeast, totals 1,090,000 men. There are only two warships over 200 tons left, and only about 500 damaged aircraft. Their ability to fight in China can be imagined. A reporter asked, what will the Commander-in-Chief do about Japan's recent request to evacuate overseas Chinese and wounded soldiers in China? Mr. He replied: There are no statistics on the number of Japanese overseas Chinese and wounded soldiers in China. As far as we know, there are more than 30,000 Japanese wounded and sick soldiers in the Southwest Theater. In the future, when our country's transportation situation permits, they will be allowed to evacuate. After talking to this point, he shook hands with the reporters and then met with Shaanxi party and government officials, members of the Senate, and gentry, and had breakfast with them. Afterwards, he rested briefly at the headquarters and then went to the airport.

Xi'an, 28th – At 8:30 PM on the 27th, Commander-in-Chief He convened a meeting with Commander Hu of the First War Zone, Commander Sun of the Eleventh War Zone, and senior staff from the Second, Eighth, and Twelfth War Zones to instruct them on matters related to accepting the Japanese surrender and to show the authorities of the various war zones the 13 memoranda to be sent to the Japanese envoy Imai.

### Yan Huiging and Other Representatives of General Jiang Bocheng Comfort Allied Nationals in Internment Camps

Warmly Received, Continued Comforting this Morning

The English, American, Belgian, and Dutch allied nationals in this city's internment camps, currently numbering over 5,800, have endured great hardship in recent years. Our government is deeply concerned about them. Now, fortunately, the light of day has returned, and they can regain their freedom. General Jiang Bocheng, representative of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek stationed in Shanghai, understanding the Chairman's intentions, originally intended to visit and comfort them in person as soon as possible. However, due to illness and difficulty in walking, he sent a letter yesterday to Mr. Yan Huiging and six others as representatives, carrying flower shields bearing Chairman Chiang's name to visit the various internment camps. Yesterday morning, they jointly visited three internment camps. The allied nationals warmly welcomed them and were deeply excited. This morning, the seven representatives will continue to visit the other three internment camps, and there will undoubtedly be an even grander scene.

Jiang's Letter to the Seven Representatives

The representatives invited by Mr. Jiang Bocheng are Ambassador Yan Huiging, Minister Liu Chongjie, Minister Luo Zhongyi, Minister Zhu Hexiang, Mr. He Dekui, Ms. Sun Wangguoxiu, and Mr. Chen Qijun, seven in total. The letter stated: (Excerpt omitted) "Upon investigation, the allied nationals in this port are trapped in internment camps, which our government has always been concerned about. Now, fortunately, the Allied forces have triumphed, and the allied nationals can regain their freedom. Bocheng should have followed the Chairman's intention to visit and comfort them in person. However, due to my poor health since suffering a stroke last year, I still have difficulty walking and cannot personally attend to this matter. Considering that you have long-standing and close relationships with the allied nationals, I would like to invite you to jointly visit and comfort them on my behalf. I am specially sending this letter and hope you will kindly agree to it."

Departure Early in the Morning for Visits

Yesterday morning around 8 o'clock, the representatives gathered at Mr. Yan's residence. Mr. Yan first greeted them warmly. Mr. Yan, wearing a white suit, looked energetic and healthy. After a brief conversation, they happily set off, accompanied by Mr. Huang Jiade, Deputy Director-General specially assigned by the Shanghai All-Circles Reception Committee for Allied Nationals. They first went to the Longhua Internment Camp, then to the camps on Zhongshan Road and Lincoln Road. Each camp had been notified in advance, and the allied nationals were prepared to welcome them. The rooftops were covered with the flags of the allied nations, fluttering in the sunlight, making people feel particularly excited. Moreover, there were American black musicians in the camps who played the Party song on wind instruments when the representatives arrived, expressing their welcome.

Warm Welcome from Allied Nationals

After Mr. Yan and the others entered the camps, the allied nationals, both men and women, gathered to express their sincere welcome, chatting about their past experiences, talking about their families, expressing their admiration, or asking for autographs. Among them, some allied nationals who had lived in China for decades, who had known the representatives for a long time, could not help but shed tears as they talked about the hardships they had endured in the past. However, after expressing their emotions, they all expressed joy and excitement. Among the three camps visited yesterday, the Longhua Camp was the largest, with 1,735 allied nationals. The hosts were British Vice-Consul Evans and three others. The camp was equipped with farms and sports fields, and great efforts were made in its management and facilities. The Zhongshan Road Camp had 1,008 allied nationals, including foreign Chinese and black people. The camp had a very well-organized self-government system. The Lincoln Road Camp consisted of houses separated from each other, with only 350 allied nationals, mostly elderly men and women. Entering and exiting each camp had already been restored to freedom.

Speeches by Representatives of Allied Nationals

After Mr. Yan and the others entered each camp, they first presented flower shields bearing the name of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek. The allied nationals gathered and cheered in respect. Then, they were welcomed by the representatives of the allied nationals in each camp to the assembly area. After being introduced, they delivered a message of condolence on behalf of Mr. Jiang Bocheng. (The text of the speech will be published tomorrow). The allied nationals were extremely excited after listening, and applause thundered. The following is an excerpt from the reply of Mr. Xiu Shan (Dutch), the representative of the Zhongshan Road Camp: "We are extremely grateful that Ambassador Yan and others have come to comfort us on behalf of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek today. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek is preoccupied with many affairs, but he still cares about the allied nationals in Shanghai, which shows the profound friendship of China towards the allied nations. In the past two weeks, people from all walks of life in Shanghai have come to comfort us in an endless stream, and relief items have also been donated one after another. We are deeply moved and feel the greatness of the Chinese people's sympathy. Ambassador Yan mentioned the suffering of the allied nationals in the internment camps. We dare say that the suffering we have endured is far less than one ten-thousandth of the hardship and suffering endured by the Chinese people in the past eight years. The contribution of China to the final victory of the United Nations is truly enormous. Now that world peace has been realized, China's future is even more splendid and brilliant. As friends of China, we feel extremely happy."

### Severe Punishment Decided for Government Agencies and Troops Forcibly Occupying Civilian Housing: Representative Jiang Solemnly Expresses Three Points

A Central News Agency reporter visited Representative Jiang today and was informed that he has received numerous complaints from merchants and residents in recent days, stating that many government agencies and troops are still forcibly occupying civilian housing and engaging in various illegal acts. This matter has greatly affected the nation's prestige and the reputation of all military personnel and civil servants. He has repeatedly issued orders to prohibit such behavior, but unfortunately, such situations still exist, which is deeply regrettable. Strict punishment methods have now been adopted and will be implemented immediately. In the future, if citizens encounter such situations again, they are allowed to come to the office to report them at any time, and they will be investigated and dealt with according to the law, without any leniency. Representative Jiang then showed the reporter a telegram from Chairman Chiang, which stated in essence: "In the Nanjing and Shanghai areas, there are no representatives besides Representative Jiang. Before Commander-in-Chief He arrives in Nanjing and the central government formally establishes regulations, no one is allowed to privately take over pseudo-government agencies, factories, and assets." It also ordered Representative Jiang to notify that all reception measures in the recovered areas must not be privately taken over by anyone before the central government issues orders, to avoid committing offenses. Finally, Representative Jiang solemnly expressed three points: (1) Reception measures should comply with Chairman Chiang's orders and await the central government's regulations. Hasty and reckless actions should be avoided to prevent offenses. (2) The safety of the people's lives and property will be legally protected. (3) If any government agency, troop, or co-worker engages in illegal actions in the future, they will be severely punished without any leniency.

### American Giant Aircraft Visit Shanghai Yesterday, Will Transfer to Japan Tomorrow for Investigation

The Allied personnel disembarked and nodded with smiles, expressing their deep gratitude. After disembarking, the Allied personnel drove to the Ducheng Hotel on Fuzhou Road and Jiangxi Road to rest. They were all in high spirits and excitement. Several of them rested briefly and then tried throwing boomerangs as a game, as if they had forgotten the fatigue of their long flight. The inside and outside of the Ducheng Hotel were crowded with welcoming citizens, and some asked for signatures in autograph books to commemorate the event. The Allied personnel all obliged.

Mission of This Trip

At 5:00 PM, a Central News Agency reporter drove to visit and was received by Mr. McGregor, a journalist from the United Press who came with the plane. He said that the trip was led by Lieutenant Colonel McCrea and departed from New York a month ago.

### Special Investigation Office Hopes Citizens Will Pay Attention to Scammers, Can Request to See Armbands and Supporting Documents

The person in charge of the Southeast Regional Commissioner's Office of the Special Economic Investigation Office of the Central Bureau of Investigation and Statistics stated: "Recently, it has been reported that unscrupulous people are using the name of our office to swindle and deceive. However, citizens often report only after something has happened, and the facts are not detailed enough, so we have been unable to investigate them at the time, which is deeply regrettable. Upon investigation, the field officers and investigators of our office are generally not allowed to go out at will. If it is necessary to send them out due to work, they must carry an armband, supporting documents, and an assignment slip, indicating the location to which they are assigned, the house number, and the matters to be handled. It is impossible for scammers to impersonate them. We hope citizens will pay special attention to this point. In the future, if such incidents occur, you must first request to see their armbands and other supporting documents. If they cannot produce them, they are impostors and should immediately report to our office by telephone (telephone numbers 72031, 71834) so that we can quickly investigate. If you do not have a telephone or are far away from our office, you should immediately report to the nearest law enforcement agency to arrest them. We hope that all citizens of the city will cooperate to eliminate these scammers who harm society. Furthermore, our office is currently focusing on investigation work and preparing reports for submission to the central government for review and approval. We have never taken any other actions externally."
