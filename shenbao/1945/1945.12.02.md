### The Chinese and Soviet Sides Agree to Negotiate An Extension of the Soviet Troop Withdrawal Deadline

Nationalist Troops Only Ninety Li from Shenyang

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 1st] Regarding the withdrawal of Soviet troops from the Northeast, according to official sources, the Chinese and Soviet governments have agreed after consultation to revise the completion date of the withdrawal to January 1st of next year (originally set for December 3rd of this year). It is also reported that this revision is to enable Chinese personnel going to the Northeast for takeover, and Chinese government troops, to arrive in the Northeast before the deadline, in accordance with the newly established methods, to carry out their takeover tasks.

[United Press, Chongqing, 1st] Today, the Chinese side here firmly stated that the Soviet Union has agreed to Chinese airlift troops landing in Changchun and Shenyang, and has permitted Chinese air force ground personnel to immediately proceed to the aforementioned two locations to arrange for the landing of airlift troops. They further stated that the Soviet Union has agreed to Chinese ground troops advancing towards Shenyang. According to an unconfirmed report, the vanguard of the Nationalist troops has advanced to a location only ninety li from Shenyang. It is rumored that the Soviet authorities have cleared the communist troops and other miscellaneous forces from Changchun airfield, and that communication has been restored at the airfield's radio station and other important locations. While observers here are more optimistic about the prospects of recovering the Nine Eastern Provinces soon due to the developments of the past few days, the internal strife between communist troops and Nationalist troops in broad areas of North China remains serious.

[China News Agency, Tianjin, 1st] The Nationalist troops in Jinzhou are continuing to advance. The airfield in that county is now usable. The section of the Beining Railway from Tianjin to Qinhuangdao is frequently patrolled by road protection troops with armored vehicles, and is now unobstructed. The section from Qinhuangdao to Yu Guan is impassable due to the destruction of a railway bridge, but traffic has resumed between Yu Guan and Jinzhou.

All Countries Hope the Letter and Spirit of the Sino-Soviet Treaty Will Not Be Overstepped

[United Press, Chongqing, 1st] The ancillary conditions of the Sino-Soviet agreement are unknown, but this move has great significance domestically and internationally, namely that the Soviet Union is handing over the Nine Eastern Provinces to the Central Government, not to the Chinese Communist Party. After this issue is favorably resolved, the work of the new American ambassador, Marshall, in China will be easier to undertake. Officials here remain silent regarding rumors of Soviet demands. Indeed, such concessions would effectively make the Northeast a jointly administered area, which cannot but cause serious concern to other countries, as all countries clearly hope that the letter and spirit of the Sino-Soviet treaty will not be overstepped. At the same time, the high-ranking officials in charge of the Northeast takeover are expected to quickly return to Changchun. The Chinese Communist Party once regarded the Northeast as being in their pocket, and now they will be greatly disappointed by this agreement. However, the CCP must have gotten wind of something, as all communist troops in Changchun have already withdrawn. Whether this move was at the request of the Soviet Union is unknown.

### The First Batch of Nationalist Troops Transported by Air Depart from Beiping, Now Arrived in Changchun

[This Newspaper, Chongqing, 1st] Regarding the takeover and management of railways in the Northeast, both parties are in smooth negotiation, and discussions are still ongoing. The work of transporting Nationalist troops by air to Changchun is being actively arranged by General Xiao Yanping, deputy director of the Northeast Headquarters. It is reported that the authorities currently feel that there is an insufficient number of technical personnel for employment, causing great inconvenience in the takeover and management. Therefore, they temporarily intend to rely on American and Soviet technical personnel to assist with everything, and the same goes for the original Japanese technicians in the Northeast.

[United Press, Chongqing, 1st] The chairmen of three provinces of the Nine Eastern Provinces have already arrived in Jinzhou, preparing to take over the administrative organs of these three provinces.

[This Newspaper, Chongqing, 1st] General Zhang Lehua, deputy commander of the Northeast Security Command, will fly to Hankou and then to Xunyang in the next few days, because the Southwest Cadre Training Corps has been ordered to move to the old site of the Lushan Training Corps in Xingzi County and will be renamed the Central Reintegration Training Corps. The commanding officer is specifically making arrangements for everything, and will then fly to the Northeast to direct the reintegration work. Furthermore, according to a broadcast from San Francisco, the first batch of Nationalist troops transported by air has departed from Beiping and arrived in Changchun.

[Central News Agency, Beiping, 1st] Xu Cheng, chairman of the Liaoning Provincial Government, is leading personnel from the provincial government to Jinzhou in the next few days to proceed to Shenyang with the army to handle the takeover work.

### Marshall Will Surely Have New Instructions Regarding All Unresolved Work in China, Said Wedemeyer at a Press Conference

[Central News Agency, This City News] General Wedemeyer hosted the press corps of this city at the Construction Building yesterday morning, with Mr. Deng Shuxun of the US Information Service acting as translator. The meeting lasted about an hour. Wedemeyer first stated: General Marshall's arrival in China for work is a fortunate choice, and we are extremely pleased with this. This is because Marshall is a man who dares to act, has experience in both military and political affairs, acts impartially, and has judgment, and is highly trusted by the US Congress. Marshall will arrive in China to take office within ten days to two weeks.

Regarding Hurley's Statement

Regarding Ambassador Hurley's statement, Wedemeyer did not make any criticisms, but said: Ambassador Hurley cooperated extremely well with him, faithfully implemented American policy, and was extremely friendly with Wedemeyer. It is believed that Marshall's arrival in China will surely bring new instructions regarding all unresolved work. Details regarding the organization of the military delegation, the handling of officers and soldiers of the US military who are short of service points and cannot return to their country, and the withdrawal date of the US Marine Corps in North China are all based on American policy and can be decided after Marshall arrives in China.

Lend-Lease Act Issues

Afterward, Wedemeyer discussed the following issues with the reporters: (1) Lend-Lease Act issues. (A) The distribution method of American aircraft in Shanghai is not an example of the Lend-Lease Act. The remaining American military materials in Shanghai will be handled by the Remaining Materials Clearing Committee, and the China Theater Command is not responsible for anything. There are about seven hundred American aircraft stored, distributed in Shanghai, Kunming, Zhijiang, and other places. However, most are concentrated in Shanghai. (B) All remaining materials will be sold. The French government has already bought fifty C-46 transport aircraft in Kunming. Non-combat aircraft can be purchased at will, but the sale of combat aircraft must be approved by Washington. (C) When Wedemeyer went to Chongqing, he discussed the distribution and prices of remaining materials with President Song Ziwen, and the supply of rations to the Chinese army will continue until March 2nd of next year if there are no other changes. (D) The US military stationed in China under Wedemeyer's leadership is only responsible for assigning personnel to guard warehouses. Other measures under the Lend-Lease Act will be handled by the Overseas Clearing Committee (headed by Harvard) as instructed by Marshall in the future. (E) The aircraft in Shanghai will no longer be flown if possible, because the war has ended and efforts must be made to eliminate flight accidents to avoid unnecessary sacrifices.

China and the Soviet Union Seek Agreements on Their Own

(2) Regarding the Sino-Soviet negotiations on the temporary postponement of the Soviet troop withdrawal from the Northeast, Wedemeyer did not make any criticisms, but said: It is quite comforting that matters between China and the Soviet Union can be resolved on their own without our participation. The US military is still adhering to the order not to go to the Northeast to avoid any unfortunate events. (3) Distribution of the US military in the China Theater: (A) There are about 35,000 naval, ground, and air forces in China. (B) There are about 52,000 marines, totaling two divisions, distributed in the North China region. (C) The so-called China Theater includes China, Vietnam south of 16 degrees north latitude, and Taiwan. There are 200 American troops in Taiwan and 10 American troops in Vietnam, all performing liaison work.

Two Thousand Four Thousand American Troops

(4) The situation of the US military being sent back to their country. If there are no major changes in January of next year, 24,000 American troops can return home. There will be more transport ships in the future. Recently, 9,000 American troops have been sent back to their country. Finally, Wedemeyer asked all reporters to pay attention and not to casually publish affirmative statements, which would make it impossible for Wedemeyer himself to fulfill all similar promises. For example, Wedemeyer had allowed American troops to visit various places before returning home, but now the number of people is too large, making it impossible for Wedemeyer to fulfill the promise he made a month ago.

### Abolish Wartime Anti-Smuggling, Cancel Economic Blockade

Foreign Trade Restored to Freedom

[This Newspaper, Chongqing, 1st] It is reported that the administrative authorities, in view of the fact that the war has ended, have ordered all tax collection and anti-smuggling agencies to abolish the wartime anti-smuggling and economic blockade measures previously established during the war. Furthermore, the Trade Commission ended at the end of last month, and the Reconstruction Corporation is scheduled to end at the end of this month. After the cancellation of unified sales and unified purchases, foreign trade has been completely restored to freedom.

### US President Receives Stilwell and Gauss

[United Press, Washington, 30th] President Truman separately received General Stilwell, the former commander of the US military in the China-India-Burma Theater, and Gauss, the former ambassador to China, today. The conversations between the President and the former military and diplomatic representatives to China have attracted the attention of China observers here, as this move occurred after Hurley's resignation, amidst much discussion. In addition, President Truman also received the British Ambassador to the US, Halifax, and the British Air Chief Marshal Tedder.

### Kyoto Cultural Relics (Part Two)

— Shen Zhi

Based on the catalogs compiled by the Japanese puppet regime and the opinions of authoritative individuals, a brief description of the contents of the currently sealed cultural relics is provided below:

Regarding the book section: The more substantial libraries in Nanjing include the Central Library, the Guoxue Library, the Central University Library, the Jinling University Library, and the Municipal Library. In addition, there are no fewer than twenty or thirty libraries belonging to the government's civil service office, the accounting office, the Executive Yuan, and its affiliated ministries and commissions, and the central department. There are also many private collections, making it impossible to investigate them all at once. For example, Professor Miao Fenglin alone has more than 7,000 books, which are said to be currently sealed in the Zhugiao Geological Survey Institute.

When Nanjing retreated, the Central Library only took more than 10,000 volumes with them, leaving more than 80,000 volumes in Nanjing, including 40,000 volumes stored in the Forbidden City warehouse, but only 30,000 volumes have been reported so far.

The Guoxue Library evolved from Tao Shu's Xiyin Caisher, which was built during the Daoguang period of the Qing Dynasty. Duanfang later renamed it the Jiangnan Library. After several changes, it acquired its current name. The collection mainly consists of the Ding family's collection from Qiantang, with more than forty Song editions, one hundred Yuan editions, and countless Ming editions, some of which are said to have been taken westward, but thirty or forty copies still remain. The library also contains Mr. Song Jiaoren's posthumous works, and it is unknown if they are also safe. Director Liu Yimou has arrived in Nanjing, waiting to participate in the cleanup.

Jinling University is known for its collection of gazetteers, ancient Chinese agricultural affairs, and unique animal and plant pests. It also has Yuan and Ming editions, Song Dynasty palace editions, Japanese editions, and Goryeo editions. After Japan's surrender, it was stolen and sold by Japanese invaders, resulting in significant losses. These books fell into the hands of the Japanese puppet regime after the Pacific War, so they were not mixed with the books stored in other libraries, making it easy for the original owners to reclaim them.

Many books from various places were concentrated in the Zhugiao Geological Survey Institute by the Japanese puppet regime and were partially sorted. A small catalog was published, indicating that they planned to continue doing so regularly. In addition, the pseudo-Central Library, including the "Ze Ren Wen Ku," has two million books sealed in Nanjing.

Regarding astronomical and meteorological instruments, when the Central Research Institute's Astronomical and Meteorological Research Institutes retreated westward, a portion of the instruments was moved away. A portion left in Nanjing was either stolen or damaged, but the Ming Dynasty armillary sphere and sundial, which had been looted during the Eight-Nation Alliance invasion, still exist. During the Eight-Nation Alliance invasion, these two ancient astronomical instruments were taken to Germany, and only returned after the end of World War I. Although there are not many items at both Beijige and Zijin Mountain, seals were added, and they are very intact. I believe that no one but scholars would be interested in them.

As for the museum section, the scope is wider than that of the book section. The main items are the Forbidden City's antiquities, including bronzes, jade objects, and paintings, which are all sealed in the Central Research Institute. According to the catalog compiled by the Japanese puppet regime, there are more than 7,000 items in total. In addition, there are more than 2,000 volumes of Forbidden City archives, which were originally buried in the Forbidden City Museum, and were later excavated by the Japanese puppet regime. They are now divided between Beijige, the Geological Survey Institute, and the pseudo-Central Library. It is believed that not many have been lost. The Central Research Institute's animal specimens and geological specimens are sealed in the Central Research Institute. Huang Nianqu has been sent to Beijing by the Forbidden City Museum and is also waiting to participate in the cleanup work. The specific situation can only be known after investigation. (Nanjing, 23rd)

### According to US Army Department Officials, Marshall Has Left Washington, It Is Rumored That He Will Take Over as Secretary of State in the Future

[Central News Agency, Washington, 30th Dispatch] After Marshal Marshall met with Truman and Byrnes at the White House on the 28th, the outside world knew nothing about his activities in Washington. Marshal Marshall has not yet had time to meet with reporters, nor has he issued a statement on his new appointment. According to Army Department officials, Marshal Marshall has left Washington. If he is not delayed by attending the meeting to investigate the Pearl Harbor incident, he will, as Truman said yesterday, be expected to leave for China in the next few days.

[United Press, Washington, 1st] Today, some diplomats here speculate that General Marshall, the temporary US ambassador to China, may become Secretary of State after completing his mission, while the current Secretary of State, Byrnes, may become ambassador to the UK. The basis for this speculation has not been confirmed. It is said that President Truman is dissatisfied with the State Department because the reports and opinions it provides are not good, the Palestine issue being one example. The President believes that to make the reorganization of the State Department effective, it is necessary to use someone who is completely free from political and partisan pressure, such as Marshall. Observers point out that even if this speculation is accurate under the current circumstances, it can be overturned by the evolution of events.

### President Song Will Come to Shanghai Next Week

According to the English-language newspaper "Shanghai Evening Post & Mercury" in this city, President of the Executive Yuan Song Ziwen will visit Shanghai again next week. It is heard that he will give instructions on the current tasks of the city's reconstruction, and that after arriving in Shanghai, he also intends to go to Nanjing to actively arrange for the return of the national government to the capital. President Song visited Shanghai last month to assist the relevant authorities in resolving issues such as the coal shortage, the resumption of work in yarn factories, the restoration of inland river navigation, and the takeover of enemy and puppet industries. Therefore, all parties have high hopes for Song's trip.

### The Jinpu Railway Linzao Line is Open to Traffic, Coal is Continuously Transported to Nanjing and Shanghai

[Central News Agency, Jinan, 30th] The Linzao branch line of the Jinpu Railway, which had been blocked for nearly two months, was reopened to military traffic on November 19th. The coal stored near the Zaozhuang and Taozhuang mines is being continuously transported to Xuzhou, and then transferred to Nanjing and Shanghai. The Linzao branch line was originally built for coal transportation. After the Japanese army surrendered, it was destroyed by the communist army. The communist army also recklessly destroyed the Zaozhuang and Taozhuang coal mines. Currently, the section between Linzao and Tai'an cannot be opened to traffic, and the coal shortage in Jinan cannot be resolved for the time being.

### He Long Leads His Troops in a Second Fierce Attack, Fierce Fighting on the Periphery of Baotou

Communist Troops Attacking Gui Sui Use Surrendered Japanese Soldiers as Gunners

[Central News Agency, Gui Sui, 1st] Communist military leader He Long personally led 10,000 of his so-called core troops to launch a second fierce attack on the city walls of Baotou at 6:00 p.m. on the 29th. After a night of fierce fighting, they achieved nothing. On the morning of the 30th, the Nationalist troops on the periphery of Baotou rushed to the scene and have counter-encircled He Long's troops. Fierce fighting is still ongoing. Furthermore, the communist troops besieging Baotou are accompanied by nine field guns and more than ten mortars. The gunners are all re-armed surrendered Japanese soldiers.

[United Press, Chongqing, 1st] According to reports from the Nationalist army, the communist army has begun to attack Gui Sui, using artillery fire. Among them, a Japanese officer is leading a Japanese artillery unit to participate.

[Central News Agency, Jiuquan, 30th] The Inner Mongolia Ejina Banner Chamber of Commerce, Education Association, Temples and various mass organizations have recently sent a telegram to Mao Zedong, hoping that he will "rein in at the edge of the precipice" because the communist party is causing chaos and hindering reintegration.

[United Press, Chongqing, 1st] According to the Central News Agency, 20,000 communist troops in Shandong, possessing 100 machine guns and 30 field guns, are now 40 li east of Jinan, preparing to attack Jinan. 200,000 communist troops are successively entering Shandong Province from the borders of Jiangsu, Henan, and Anhui. The communist army is dividing its forces into four routes to invade Shandong and has made considerable progress. The communist army on the west route has crossed Caozhou, the central route has reached Tai'an, the east route has crossed Linyi near the Jiaoji Railway in southeastern Shandong, and the communist army along the coast has passed the Jiaoji Railway and is heading to the Northeast.

### Weekly Forum: A Lesson of History

— Chen Gaoyong

——The situation of China's great unification must not be destroyed

"Unity follows division, and division follows unity." Although this cyclical phenomenon of order and chaos is an undeniable vestige of Chinese history, ever since the Qin Dynasty unified the Central Plains, the situation of great unification has become the sole condition for the Chinese people to strive for survival for two thousand years. Because prolonged division makes it impossible for the people to survive and leaves the rulers powerless, the goal jointly sought by the people and the government is to move from division to unity, from separation to unification.

Whether in ancient or modern times, in China or abroad, the greatest demand of people's lives is to live and work in peace and contentment in reality. To demand to live and work in peace and contentment, the environment must be peaceful and the order unified. This is an extremely common and simple truth. Moreover, after the Qin and Han Dynasties in China, the ability to create a situation of great unification, and for the people to regard realizing great unification as the highest goal in their ideal life, was due to the existence of special reasons.

First, from the perspective of agriculture and water conservancy. Since the Zhou Dynasty, there is no doubt that agricultural production has become the main production undertaking of the people. Agricultural production is closely related to water conservancy. China's two major rivers are the Yellow River and the Yangtze River, both of which flow from west to east through six or seven provinces into the sea. Water conservancy includes both promoting benefits and eliminating harms: opening ditches to benefit irrigation is a matter of promoting benefits; building dams to prevent flooding is a matter of eliminating harms. Neither promoting benefits nor eliminating harms can be accomplished under a divided and separatist situation. Because the two major rivers cross six or seven provinces from east to west, if there are two or more opposing regimes among these six or seven provinces, the benefits created by the people upstream cannot be connected with the people downstream, and the harms that the people downstream want to eliminate cannot obtain the cooperation of the people upstream. Not only is it futile, but it is also impossible to start. Moreover, water conservancy projects are huge, costly, and time-consuming. Without a strong and unified organization, it is difficult to carry them out. Therefore, from a historical perspective, many great water conservancy projects were built during times of national unification and universal peace. Whenever there was fragmentation, separation, and turmoil, floods and droughts often occurred year after year. Because of floods and droughts, the people suffered from famine, and because of famine, internal strife arose, and because of internal strife, foreign troubles were invited. Natural disasters and man-made disasters followed like shadows. At this time, the people were barely able to save themselves from death, let alone live and work in peace and contentment? After such a long period of practical experience, the people naturally developed an extremely ardent demand and love for the unity of the country.

Secondly, from the perspective of industry, commerce, and transportation. Although China before today was a country based on agriculture, the gradual development of industry and commerce after the Spring and Autumn and Warring States periods is an undeniable fact. The so-called industry in the past of course referred to handicraft industry, and the so-called commerce was nothing more than the exchange of agricultural products and handicraft products. But once the people had exchange activities, it was by no means possible to live peacefully and enjoy their customs in small countries with few people who did not interact with each other until old age. They needed to be connected with each other, they needed transportation to disaster areas, and they needed to exchange goods and make work easier. Therefore, as early as the Zuo Zhuan, it was recorded that: "Juniper and lacquer and leather came from Chu, but although Chu had the materials, Jin actually used them." Economic geographers divide human transportation into periods: the first period is inland river transportation, the second period is inland sea transportation, the third period is ocean transportation, and the fourth period is continental transportation. This periodization is inevitably somewhat modified since the realization of air transportation, but the division of the first three periods is still extremely accurate. China has no inland seas, so before ocean transportation, inland river transportation fulfilled a very long and very important responsibility. China has many tributaries of inland rivers, but the so-called Jiang, Huai, He, Han, and Pearl River, as well as artificially created canals, all pass through at least two or three provinces today. If there were small countries standing like forests within China, with layers of customs barriers, how could one talk about exchanging goods and making work easier? Therefore, from the history of China, every time the country was unified, it was an opportunity for commerce to rise, and once the country was in turmoil, industrial and commercial enterprises inevitably plummeted. The prosperous eras of the Han and Tang Dynasties, as well as the unified eras of the Song, Yuan, Ming, and Qing Dynasties, not only saw the vigorous development of domestic commerce, but also the great prosperity of international trade outside the region. Conversely, during periods such as the Wu Hu Disturbance, the opposition between the Northern and Southern Dynasties, and the great chaos at the end of the Yuan Dynasty, not only did international trade completely stagnate, but all domestic commercial capital also completely collapsed, and the people's economy had to return to a self-sufficient natural state. The so-called merchant class that valued the superficial over the fundamental of the past, they certainly sought only profit, but in the long-term experience of seeking only profit, they also gained an intuitive understanding, that is, if the country is not unified and the situation is not peaceful, their business cannot be done.

Since the people's real life is so closely related to the unity of the country, the ordinary people of China, who for two thousand years seemed to have no abstract concepts such as country and nation, have actually fulfilled extremely great responsibilities of loving and protecting the country and nation. Their love and protection of the country and nation is intuitive, knowing what it is but not knowing why, but their emotions are very real and very sharp. They have an extremely realistic and extremely simple idea: whoever can unify China, they will support him; whoever wants to disrupt China, they will despise him. Because the former can enable them to live and work in peace and contentment, and the latter will cause them to be ruined and die. This idea, of course, sometimes inevitably leads to malpractices, so in the past, sometimes alien races entered and ruled China, and if they could maintain China's long-term unity, the people would live in a state of temporary peace. Therefore, the ancient sages strictly defended the separation between the Yi and Xia, and the modern revolution advocated nationalism, all to correct biases and remedy abuses. But, in any case, the urgency of the Chinese people's demand for unity is conceivable.

This concept is not only held by ordinary people, but also by the so-called intellectual class of scholar-officials. In every change of dynasty, there are always many loyal ministers and righteous men who sacrifice their lives to try to reverse the decline. The formation of this kind of thought and behavior is not purely caused by doctrines, nor is it solely supported by concepts, but is actually reflected from the real lives of the majority of the people and is carried out with the common support of the majority of the people. Because the majority of the people demand permanent unity and fear occasional division, they unconsciously reflect this in the minds of the intellectual class, and they also develop an extremely simple intuition, thinking that changing dynasties, regardless of whether the change is right or wrong, good or bad, during a change, there will be at least ten or several decades of turmoil and unrest, and the world will not be peaceful, and the people will not be able to live and work in peace and contentment. If we want to accomplish something in the course of Chinese history, we should deeply understand this consciousness reflected from the people's real lives and should not neglect it casually.

Today, this situation is even more obvious. The two major rivers that cross east and west still exist, and the two trunk lines that run through north and south—Jinpu, Pinghan, and Yuehan—have also been completed. The foundation of the agricultural economy is deeply rooted, the development of industry and commerce is catching up, the 450 million people of the whole country have formed a large ethnic group, and the vast territory of east, west, north, and south has formed a large economic system. The east and west cannot be split, and the north and south cannot be opposed. The military separatism of the Northern Warlords before the Northern Expedition and the arbitrary division by the enemy and puppets that passed like clouds recently are the most unbearable and unforgettable painful historical period in the lives of the people. The people may be dissatisfied with the current political situation, but they only hope to change the style and do not hope to brew internal strife.

After the Xinhai Revolution, the monarchy was abolished, the autocratic politics was overthrown, and all systems and cultural relics were reformed, which was completely different from the past. However, the situation of great unification formed in China for two thousand years must not be allowed to be destroyed, and it needs to be made even closer and more stable. Therefore, the Founding Father of the Revolution did not hesitate to use a spirit of great fearlessness to overthrow the politics of monarchical autocracy, and immediately created the term "Five Races United as One Republic" to replace it in order to maintain the situation of great unification in China. I can assert that in this way of evolution of Chinese history, although political systems and social organizations can continue to change with the shift of the times, the situation of great unification in China must not be allowed to be destroyed.

### Soviet Troops Suddenly Withdraw from Tehran, U.S. Dispatches Delegation to Investigate Northern Iran

[United Press Tehran, 1st] It was reported here today that Soviet troops had suddenly withdrawn from Tehran starting on Thursday. Transportation hubs at train stations and private residences, including the command headquarters, have all been completely evacuated.

[Reuters Washington, 1st] The State Department announced that the U.S. Embassy in Tehran has dispatched a three-person delegation to Tabriz, the center of the Iranian disturbance. It is believed that this was arranged with the Soviets in Tehran beforehand. The United States suggested last week that foreign troops withdraw from Iran by January 1st of next year, but Britain and the Soviet Union have not yet responded.

Soviet Note Replies to Iran, Denies Interference in Internal Affairs

[Reuters Tehran, 1st] The contents of the note from the Soviet Embassy to the Iranian Foreign Ministry were released today: Not only does the Soviet side refuse to allow Iran to pass through, but it also denies all the points of Iran's accusations against the Soviet side. It is claimed that if more Iranian troops move north, war and bloodshed in northern Iran will be unavoidable. For this reason, the Soviet government has had to increase troops in Iran to protect the Soviet garrison there. However, since the Soviet government does not want to increase troops in Iran, it is best for the Iranian government not to send troops to the northern provinces of Iran. The Soviet note also denies that the Soviet Union has interfered in Iran's politics and economy, and denies that it has aided the Kuchi tribes. The fact that Bassal sneaked into Iran from Iraq has nothing to do with the Soviet Union. Furthermore, the obstacles and difficulties in Iran's plan to establish border outposts on the Iran-Turkey border are also fought by the Soviet Union. The Soviet note claims that the events in northern Iran were actually caused by Iranian gendarmes and officials.

Peace or Preparation for War, People Anxious and Uneasy

The delivery of the Soviet note greatly surprised Iranian political circles, which was completely contrary to the recent expressions of goodwill from Britain, the United States, and Iran. However, shortly after the note was released, officials announced that Soviet troops in Tehran had withdrawn from train stations, transportation hubs, and military camps. The public is still unclear about the intention of this move, whether it is for peace or for preparation for war. It is also rumored that British and American troops have concentrated in Baghdad and southern Iran, but the truth remains to be verified. News from northern Iran said that Soviet troops have dug out war teams to prevent Iranian troops from heading north in case they are unwilling to accept the Soviet refusal. Although the government is trying to stabilize public sentiment, it cannot hide the seriousness of the facts. Merchants in Tehran have moved their families and documents to safe areas in southern Iran, and troops continue to arrive in the capital to deploy defenses and arrange positions in the suburbs.

### UN General Assembly Decides to Establish Social and Economic Committees, Election of Judges Should Not Be Delayed, Liang Yunli's Proposal Gains Support from Representatives

[Reuters London, 1st] At a meeting of the technical committee of the United Nations General Assembly today, the Ukrainian representative stated that the General Assembly should only establish one main committee on economic and social issues. Dividing these two tasks may cause important social recommendations to go astray. Today's meeting debated the issue of whether to establish one or two economic and social committees based on practical convenience. After the final vote, the proposal by the five major powers to establish two committees in light of the broad scope of work was successful.

[Central News Agency London, 29th] When the Preparatory Committee reviewed the legal issues of the United Nations this evening, the Chinese representative Liang Yunli expressed opposition to the Australian representative's proposal to postpone the election of judges to the International Court of Justice. Liang's reason was that China believes that thorough preparations are necessary for the election of judges, but it is also necessary for the main organs of the United Nations to be established simultaneously. If the International Court of Justice, which symbolizes world justice, is not organized when other main organs are established, it will damage the reputation of the United Nations. Moreover, delaying the establishment of the International Court of Justice may be used as an excuse to set a precedent for delaying other organs. The opinion of the Chinese representative was supported by the American representative Stephen Hess.

### Establishment of Temporary Trusteeship Committee Remains Unresolved

[Reuters London, 1st] The Yugoslav representative to the technical committee of the United Nations yesterday submitted a counter-proposal to the executive committee's plan to establish a temporary trusteeship council. The three delegations of the Soviet Union, Yugoslavia, and Czechoslovakia opposed the establishment of a temporary trusteeship council in the executive committee. They insisted on their claim in the preparatory committee for two reasons: (1) this proposal violates the charter, and (2) the establishment of a temporary one will delay the establishment of a permanent one. The counter-proposal submitted by the Yugoslav representative proposes that the draft agreements for entrusting the entrusted powers to place their entrusted lands under trusteeship should be submitted to the first General Assembly of the United Nations, and that a committee on this matter should provide its opinions on the draft agreements to the General Assembly. Therefore, the trusteeship council should be established immediately. The representatives of the five powers of the United Kingdom stated that their representative countries would study the proposals of the Yugoslav representative with sympathy.

### Hess Devises Many Schemes, Pretends to Suffer from Amnesia, Presiding Judge Announces He Is Now Fit to Stand Trial

[Reuters Nuremberg, 1st] The military tribunal here decided today that Hess, the former deputy leader of Germany who flew to England on a mysterious mission in 1941, must be tried together with the other nineteen major Nazi war criminals. The court continued to open the trial shortly after 9:00 a.m. this morning (5:00 p.m. Shanghai time). Presiding Judge Lorents announced, "Based on various evidence, the court believes that the defendant Hess is now fit to stand trial. Therefore, the motion of the defendant's lawyer should be rejected."

[United Press Nuremberg, 30th] Hess has a terrifying appearance and is naturally cunning. After being captured in England, he seemed to suffer from amnesia. Today, a special inquiry was held to ask whether Hess should continue to be tried. Unexpectedly, Hess read out an astonishing confession, claiming that he was faking amnesia, and the doctors and lawyers of the United Nations were deceived by him. Before the court opened today, Hess only said that he intended to speak in court, but did not explain what he would say.

### Villages Near Ambarawa Bombed Flat by British Troops, Dutch Deputy Governor Says Door to Negotiations Not Closed

[Reuters Batavia, 1st] Indonesian artillery continued to bombard the expatriate camps in Ambarawa last night without stopping. The British were forced to dispatch ten aircraft to drop 6,000 pounds of bombs and 32 rockets on a target area of 400 square yards. It is said that the villages in the center of the area have been bombed flat. An Allied communiqué added that northern Bandung has been cleared, but did not mention encountering resistance from Indonesians. Oen Galan village between Sambong and Ambarawa was occupied by British Indian troops yesterday. A British military administrative agency has been established in Surabaya.

[Reuters Batavia, 1st] Dutch East Indies Deputy Governor Van Mook told reporters yesterday that the situation has eased again, so it may be possible to resume negotiations with the Indonesian side. The door to negotiations remains wide open, but when they will be held is still unknown. I believe that no country can allow its citizens to be constantly threatened and allow its enemies to evade fulfilling the terms of surrender. There are many misunderstandings about the issue of Dutch troops. It must be known that this is the land under the jurisdiction of the Kingdom of the Netherlands, but Dutch troops are not allowed to rescue their citizens and enforce the terms of surrender. How can this be understood?

### German Prisoners of War Attempt Suicide After Being Extradited from Sweden to Soviet Union

[Associated Press Swedish Capital, 30th] After Germany surrendered, 3,000 soldiers from Germany, Austria, Poland, and the Baltic countries fled to Sweden and were detained in concentration camps. Because the Soviet Union requested extradition, they were escorted on board by Swedish guards today. The detainees were unwilling to be extradited and resisted with all the weapons they could obtain, turning the concentration camp into a battlefield. Dozens of German soldiers set up obstacles in the barracks and began to commit suicide with knives and razor blades as the guards approached. Swedish guards had to use batons to prevent them from harming their limbs. Others stripped off their clothes, piled into cars, and boarded ships naked. More than seventy German soldiers were injured and fell in one concentration camp.

### Recruitment Meeting for Displaced and Out-of-School Youth: Active Registration Work in Progress

[From Our Correspondent] The War Zone Youth Recruitment Committee has registered over 900 displaced and out-of-school youth from the Beijing-Shanghai Railway line. These youth recently took level placement exams at registration points in Suzhou, Yangzhou, Zhenjiang, and Shanghai. The list of accepted candidates has already been announced. Approximately one hundred people from the Shanghai area participated, and they are scheduled to gather tomorrow to travel to Beijing and attend classes at a national middle school.

Continuing Requests

Regarding the continued registration of displaced youth in the future, it is reported that the Recruitment Committee will still grant registration and find ways to help them return to school. According to Mr. Gan Jiaxin, Deputy Director of the Youth Recruitment Committee, the relief work for displaced and out-of-school youth in this city has been discussed with Minister Zhu and Mr. Wang Bao Xuan, Deputy Director of the Third War Zone Recruitment Branch, in recent days. It has been decided to establish several more registration points in the city to facilitate students.

Preparing for Further Studies

Furthermore, it is planned to establish a preparatory class in the suburbs, with Mr. Wu Mao-sun responsible for the preparations. This class will accommodate a large number of displaced junior and senior high school students, providing both livelihood support and academic recovery. Currently, negotiations are underway with the military authorities and the Municipal Bureau of Education to allocate housing. If successful, the reception of students can begin immediately. The students will be placed in classes according to their grade level, following a general school system. High school graduates can also register and will be accommodated in university preparatory classes attached to university supplementary schools. According to Mr. Gan and Mr. Er, a Youth Training Institute has already been established in Hangzhou.

Registration and Accommodation

Those from Shanghai, Hangzhou, and other places who wish to register and be accommodated are welcome to do so. After the schools in various places are restored, the students will be dispersed or recommended to return to school by the Training Institute. When asked about the recent approval by the Executive Yuan to establish a Guidance Committee, Mr. Gan replied that the purpose of this move is to adjust wartime institutions and work to adapt to the current situation. The principle has already been decided, and although it has been formally finalized, it will not be implemented until January of next year. Currently, all institutions are continuing to work as usual to avoid any disruptions during the transition period.

[Another Report] The students from the Shanghai registration point of the Youth Recruitment Committee who were admitted have been enthusiastically going through the enrollment procedures in recent days.

### Special Interview by This Newspaper: Dynamics of Jinan University, the Highest Overseas Chinese Institution: An Interview with Principal He Bingsong by This Newspaper

Jinan University, the highest institution of learning founded by overseas Chinese, is located in Zhenru, Shanghai, with complete facilities and a grand scale. It was destroyed by enemy artillery fire during the August 13th Incident. Later, it was relocated to Jianyang, Fujian, in the rear, where it was managed diligently and achieved remarkable results. Yesterday morning, this newspaper's reporter visited Principal He Bingsong of the school at his Shanghai residence. Mr. He provided a detailed account of the school's dynamics, as follows: Jinan University was originally located in Zhenru. I (He himself) took office as the school's principal in 1935.

The Zhenru Campus Was Destroyed

During the August 13th Incident, when the War of Resistance broke out, the Zhenru campus was completely destroyed by enemy artillery fire. At that time, in order to avoid interrupting the students' studies, the school was moved to the Shanghai Concession in haste and classes were resumed. Later, when the National Army retreated westward, the school remained on the isolated island and continued classes. When the Pacific War broke out, faced with the harsh environment, it was no longer possible to stay put. I personally led all the teachers and students to the rear.

Relocated to Jianyang for Classes

Over a long distance, traveling a long way, enduring hardship, we arrived in Jianyang, northwest of Jianou County, Fujian. The Confucius Temple in that area was used as Jinan University's office, and ancestral halls and temples were borrowed as school buildings. Thatched houses were built to set up classrooms and classes resumed as usual. However, Jianyang was located in a remote area, and two major difficulties arose at the time: one was the difficulty in purchasing textbooks, and the other was the inability to purchase instruments for science and chemistry.

Solving Two Major Difficulties

After various efforts, textbooks were purchased from distant Fuzhou. All scientific instruments were temporarily borrowed from the Fujian and Zhejiang Provincial Science and Chemistry Research Institute. These two major problems were finally solved. However, it was inconvenient and uneconomical to use temporary scientific instruments. When students needed to conduct experiments, they had to go to the Fujian and Zhejiang Science and Chemistry Research Institute, which was far from the school. Each round trip was very expensive, and all expenses were borne by the school. Currently, there are only three colleges: Arts, Science, and Commerce.

Suggesting the Addition of Colleges

At this moment, as the War of Resistance has ended and national reconstruction has begun, it is urgent to expand the organization. I have submitted a proposal to the Ministry of Education, suggesting that when Jinan University returns to Shanghai to resume operations, a Normal College for Overseas Chinese, a Law College, and a Preparatory Class for Overseas Chinese should be added. Currently, I am in Shanghai, looking for a temporary school building. As a result of this effort, I am afraid that it will not be possible to achieve the goal until after the spring break at the earliest. There are currently more than 1,150 students in Jianyang. In the future, when the entire group packs up and returns to Shanghai, it will be necessary to put in a lot of effort and make advance arrangements.

### City Government Receives Press Corps: Deputy Mayor He Assumed Office Yesterday: He Expresses That He Comes to Serve as a Public Servant, Not as an Official: He Hopes to Alleviate the People's Suffering

Shanghai Deputy Mayor He De Kui assumed office at the City Government at 9:00 AM yesterday. Party, government, military, and people from all walks of life in the city flocked to the City Government to congratulate him. All gifts from various parties were declined. Mayor Qian Dajun received reporters from local newspapers at the City Government Auditorium yesterday afternoon. Deputy Mayor He De Kui and the heads of various bureaus also participated. During the meeting, Mayor Qian first introduced Deputy Mayor He, who assumed office yesterday. Then, Deputy Mayor He delivered a speech.

Mr. He's Speech

Briefly stated: Today, Shanghai's municipal affairs are complex and varied. Governance does not require many words, so please excuse me for not elaborating at this time. I come from the people, not to be an official, but to be a public servant for the people. I am determined to act in good conscience. On the passive side, I at least hope to alleviate the people's suffering. On the active side, I should seek happiness for the citizens. I hope that Shanghai will develop into an ideal metropolis under Mayor Qian's leadership. To achieve this goal, I also hope that all the citizens of Shanghai, the Shanghai press, and allied friends will provide cooperation, either in spirit or in economy and technology.

Mayor Qian's Speech

Mayor Qian delivered a speech in four sections: First, the recent establishment of a news release group by the City Government not only allows the staff of this government to concentrate on their work, but also provides more convenience for reporters from various newspapers to gather news. This is not to block news, but to facilitate both internal and external information flow. Second, municipal construction involves numerous tasks. Since the establishment of this government only eighty days ago, we often see criticisms or suggestions from various newspapers regarding municipal administration. We have adopted about 50% of them based on our consideration. Those that are temporarily difficult to implement due to practical difficulties are also being planned comprehensively. I deeply feel that the future of municipal construction involves many departments, and there is no end to the work. My colleagues in this government will definitely work hard. Although we are not confident about the results, we will humbly accept well-intentioned instructions and criticisms. Third, Shanghai is a cosmopolitan city with both Chinese and foreigners. In serving the local area, my supervision of subordinates may be insufficient. Eliminating corruption and cultivating clean politics is the established policy of this government, and we are determined to implement it thoroughly. I have repeatedly warned my subordinates to comply. I hope that you gentlemen of the press will report any misconduct that you see or hear. If such misconduct is verified after investigation, we will punish it severely. Fourth, I also serve as the Commander of the Songhu Garrison. The preparations for all the facilities of the command are completely consistent with the City Government. I am responsible for maintaining the city's public security. We are currently arranging winter defense work. All news related to the command will be released by the news release group.

Answering Reporters' Questions

Finally, reporters from various newspapers raised questions about municipal facilities, local public security, and other issues, which were answered separately as follows: (1) Regarding the issue of police treatment, Police Chief Xuan Tiewu answered that in order to remedy the livelihood problems of the police, he has been in contact with various rice merchants to purchase rice at fair prices. Recently, many theft cases have been solved, and more than 100 people have been arrested. To increase the police force in the city, he has recruited police officers from eastern Zhejiang. The first batch of more than 700 people will arrive in Shanghai within days. At the same time, there are more than 500 people, including those who have been reinstated and new recruits, who will also complete training and be dispatched to various bureaus within days. (2) Regarding the City Government properties sold by the enemy puppets, Mayor Qian said that the City Government's real estate sold by the enemy puppets will be unconditionally recovered. The properties sold by the authorities of the former French Concession during the Vichy period will also be treated the same way. (3) Regarding the city's traffic problems, Public Works Bureau Director Zhao Zeng responded that all trolleybuses and public buses in the city are very crowded due to a lack of vehicles. Within the possible scope, the French Tram Company has been ordered to find ways to add third-class carriages. (4) Regarding the issue of coordinating traffic lines, Public Works Bureau Director Zhao Zukang told reporters that the city's docks are being repaired.

### Ship Allocation Committee Established Yesterday: Gong Xuesui Presided Over the Meeting: Navy-Received Ships Still Awaiting Handling

The National Ship Allocation Committee was officially established in Chongqing and Shanghai yesterday and began operations on the same day. The Chongqing Ship Allocation Committee is responsible for ship allocation matters above Hankou, with Lu and as the Deputy Directors. The Shanghai Ship Allocation Committee is responsible for ship allocation matters below Hankou and along the coast, and it is run by Mr. Liu Hongsheng and Xu Xueyu. The establishment of the committee is of great importance to the future development of China's shipping industry. Vice Minister Gong Xuesui of the Ministry of Transportation took a train from Nanjing to Shanghai yesterday morning to attend the meeting and provide guidance. In the afternoon, he inspected the ships received and transferred to the committee by the Navy Headquarters with senior officials of the Allocation Committee. At 4:00 PM, the Allocation Committee held a principal meeting at its location on the Bund of Wuma Road. Vice Minister Gong asked the attendees for a lot of information and provided guidance. Vice Minister Gong is scheduled to return to Nanjing within days and will travel to Hankou to inspect the ship reception situation.

[Dagong Society Report] The only ships that have not yet been received are a batch from the Navy Headquarters. The number and names of these ships have not yet been determined. Director Yang, the representative of the Navy Headquarters in the inspection team, stated that he has decided to follow the central government's will to concentrate the ships and hand them over to the Allocation Committee for handling. In addition, the Emei ship of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, which was renamed Jinjiang after being occupied by the enemy, has been found in Nanjing. It was taken over by the Navy and first renamed Heping (Peace), and recently renamed Dingan.

### Enemy Property Handling Bureau: Sells Sugar at a Discounted Price: Price Set at 600 Yuan Per Jin

The Shanghai Area Enemy Property Review and Handling Committee held its fifteenth meeting on the 1st and resolved: (1) To entrust the Sugar Industry Association Reorganization Committee with the average distribution of the first batch of enemy property sugar stored in the Handling Bureau's warehouse to various retailers, and to provide it to all consumers at a fair price. The price is set at 600 yuan per jin, and each household is allowed to purchase half a jin. It is stipulated that if sugar traders and retailers do not comply, they will be fined 100 times the selling price.

Warehouse and Wharf Management Division

(2) Regarding the wharves and warehouses that have been received, those that originally belonged to the enemy and puppets will be managed and used by the Jianghai Customs. Various agencies and merchants may rent them from the Jianghai Customs. Those that belong to Allied neutral countries or Chinese merchants, after the applicant submits a request for investigation, will be returned to the original owners. The warehouses and wharves built by the Municipal Government and the former Concession Public Works Bureau and French Municipal Council will still be managed by the Municipal Government.

Allied Vehicles Can Be Requested for Return

(3) The main points of the method for returning vehicles to Allied officials and civilians are: When applying for the return of vehicles belonging to Allied officials and merchants, the applicant should send a letter to the Enemy Property Handling Bureau, along with information on the type, make, year, model, engine number, license plate number of the vehicle, as well as various documents proving ownership, and a certificate of reliable guarantee, and the certificate of the management agency. The letter should request that the Enemy Property Handling Bureau and the Municipal Public Works Bureau verify the information and determine if the vehicle should be returned. If the applicant can, as much as possible, indicate the name of the agency currently using or keeping the vehicle, and the current location where it is parked, the handling will be even more convenient. However, if the vehicle has had a sales relationship, it needs to be further verified and processed.

### Chen Yi Flew Back to Taipei Due to Fog in Shanghai

### 100,000 Chinese Laborers Still in the Sea of Suffering: Over a Thousand Overseas Chinese Arrived at Wusong Yesterday

One Bowl of Rice a Day and One Single Layer of Clothing All Year Round in Life in Japan

The Japanese ship "Mingyou Maru" (formerly mistranslated as "Mingwan Maru"), which is carrying the first batch of our compatriots detained in Japan to return home, docked and anchored at the Jiangmian River about 10,000 yards outside Wusongkou at 6:40 AM yesterday. A Central News Agency reporter took a special ship to visit the ship outside Wusongkou in the afternoon yesterday. The following are the details of the situation:

Sailed Out of Japan on the 10th of Last Month

The Mingyou Maru sailed out of Hokkaido, Japan on the 10th of last month, arrived in Kyushu on the 15th, sailed from Kyushu to Shanghai at noon on the 27th, and arrived outside Wusongkou yesterday morning. Upon learning the news, the reporter borrowed a small fire transport ship "Green Ship" from the Navy Headquarters and departed from the Navy Headquarters pier at 11:10 AM. The "Mingyou Maru" was anchored in the Jiangmian River more than 10,000 yards outside the port. The ship's hull was light gray and weighed 5,200 tons. The overseas Chinese on the ship were overjoyed to see the reporter boarding the ship. There were a total of 1,379 overseas Chinese on the ship, divided into seven teams, namely the Shanghai team led by Jia Mingli, the Muroran City teams 1 to 3 led by Wu Jinsheng and Li Bingheng, the Autumn team led by Wang Lifu, the Kakuta team led by Shen Jieren, and the Otani team led by Chen Runquan. All of the above were male Chinese laborers in Japan. The Shanghai and Kakuta teams were miners, and the rest were mostly miners.

Overseas Chinese Painfully Recount Their Experiences in Japan

According to them, around July 20, 1944, the Sino-Japanese Labor Service Association had two people in charge, a Japanese man named Ito and a Chinese traitor named Zhou Zhiwei, who were responsible for recruiting Chinese laborers in Shanghai. They stated that they would be going to Taiwan to work and used various sweet words as bait. They also used deceptive means to drive them onto Japanese ships. However, when the ship docked, they realized that they had arrived in Hokkaido, Japan. After that, they were deceived by the Japanese and forced to work as miners. They were only given one bowl of rice a day and one layer of clothing all year round. Hokkaido's climate was cold, and the snow in winter was about twenty feet deep. They were only wearing single-layer clothing, but they were still working under the whip of the Japanese until Japan surrendered. They never received any wages. It was not until August 14 of this year that they received the news of victory. Around the 20th of that month, they all stopped working and used force to resist and demand the wages they had been owed for years in Japan. The Japanese then paid them a small amount of Japanese currency, but immediately sold various daily necessities at high prices, cashing in the money that had been issued. Therefore, the lives of the thousands of overseas Chinese who returned on the Mingyou Maru are extremely painful. Most of them wear old Japanese military uniforms. One of the overseas Chinese had five US dollars, which made him a millionaire on the ship.

Chen's Wife Escorted to Shanghai on the Same Ship

The thousands of overseas Chinese who returned this time, with the exception of a few who had received secondary education or higher, were mostly Chinese laborers. However, because they had been away from their motherland for a long time, they asked the reporter about the domestic situation and were particularly concerned about domestic political issues. Many people were also concerned about the prices of goods in Shanghai, as most of them had gone from Shanghai. The overseas Chinese led the reporter to visit their cabins, which were mostly simple. They cooked their own meals in each team. The ship is scheduled to enter the port at noon on the 3rd and dock at the Qiujiang pier. The Japanese expatriates to be repatriated will be concentrated at Shanghai Jiang University in Yangshupu today. Tomorrow, the customs and military police will conduct an inspection before boarding the ship to return home. It is also learned that the Mingyou Maru does carry several people, imprisoned in a room, that the public believes are the wife of Chen Gongbo and others.

### Third Route Army Headquarters Moves from Shanghai to Wuxi

[Report from Our Newspaper] According to Mr. Zhang, Deputy Commander of the Third Route Army, who spoke to our reporter yesterday, the army headquarters and the Shanghai-Nanjing Garrison Headquarters are moving from Shanghai to Wuxi for ease of command.

After four months of diligent searching by the American War Criminals Unit, Miki, a former Japanese administrator of the Northeast Hedong Prisoner Camp, was finally captured in the Hongkou district of Shanghai. His crimes included subjecting American prisoners of war to various forms of abuse, torture, and whipping, exhausting the limits of cruelty, and confiscating medical supplies from the Red Cross, resulting in the death of over two hundred of the camp's twelve hundred prisoners. He confessed that he had been disbanded from the army in 1944 and came to Shanghai to look for work.

(2) Workers who have left the factory for a long time shall not be entitled to request severance pay, relief funds, or maintenance fees.

### China-Ordered "Zhongshan" Passenger Ship Arrives in Shanghai

-- To participate in international routes --

[Special Report from Our Newspaper] Since the Anti-Japanese War, the government has paid great attention to the shipping industry. Before the victory, it ordered two 10,000-ton passenger ships from the United States, named the "Zhongshan" and the "Zhongtong" (transliteration). The "Zhongshan" loaded over 60,000 bags of relief supplies and flour, tens of thousands of pairs of leather shoes, and 30,000 pieces of dairy milk for passengers and cargo, and 10,000 boxes of high-quality foreign wine in San Francisco, and set off for Shanghai. It entered the port on the evening of the 30th of last month and sailed directly to the Dalae Wharf in Bailianjing, South Huangpu, to unload cargo. The two passenger ships are temporarily represented by the Dalae President Shipping Company. It is reported that the "Zhongshan" will stay in Shanghai for two weeks to transport goods to the United States, and the "Zhongtong" will also arrive in Shanghai soon. From now on, Chinese ships will participate in international routes, opening a new era for the Chinese shipping industry.

### Zhang Jingen, Who Served as Enemy Translator, Is Tried

Judge Cao of the Criminal Division of the Shanghai Higher Court publicly tried the case of traitor Zhang Jingen at the court's Second Tribunal at 10:00 AM yesterday. The defendant, Zhang Jingen, 21 years old, from Dinghai, residing at 99 West Street, Jiading, served as a foreman for the Japanese troops in Jiading during the enemy puppet era, acting as their accomplice and harming the people. He was arrested by military authorities and sent to the court according to law. After taking his seat, Judge Cao had the bailiffs bring the prisoner to the court and asked him about his involvement in traitorous activities. According to Zhang, he responded to the recruitment of laborers by the Japanese Mori Detachment in Jiading in March of this year to carry white rice on ships and store it in warehouses, which were strictly guarded by the Japanese. The court inquired about the condition of the warehouse, which he said was very large and could store the food for twenty ships, each ship holding more than two hundred bags of rice. His daily wage was 1,000 yuan in puppet currency and one catty of rice. Over time, he learned some Japanese and became a translator, earning an extra catty of rice per day. Asked why he took this job, he replied that it was due to livelihood pressures. After the victory, he came to Shanghai to attend a friend's wedding feast and temporarily stayed at the Yipinxian room opened by his friend Zhao Shengchang (who served as a Japanese translator), where he was arrested by the military authorities. The court asked where Zhao was from. He replied that he was from Shanghai and did not know his residence. The judge ordered the defendant to be remanded into custody.

Public Trial of Traitor Cases

According to officials in charge of judicial organs yesterday, traitors are public enemies of the people, and the people in the occupied areas who have suffered from their poison are all deeply grieved. Therefore, the court attaches great importance to the opening of traitor trials and makes them absolutely public. The judicial personnel handling this case reside in the court and do not contact the outside world. The Shanghai and other courts have only about twenty traitor cases awaiting trial.

### Robbery in Duofu Lane Solved

The home of Madam You, a Suzhou woman, at 56 Duofu Lane (i.e., Fuxu Road) in Zhongzheng Road, was broken into by six robbers at around 8:00 PM the night before. They brandished pistols, ransacked the house, and robbed gold bars, jewelry, diamond rings, and legal currency, estimated to be worth over 2 million yuan. After the incident, the victim reported to the New City Division, who after investigation, learned that the suspects were hiding at 48 Ningbo Road in the former French Concession. They led police officers to arrest them. At the time, the robber Hu Shanlin, a native of Pudong, attempted to resist arrest and was shot in the right foot by the police officers and captured. Subsequently, Xu Genfa and five other men and two women were arrested at No. 10 Yong'an Street, A Building, upstairs in the Great Shanghai Factory, and five pistols were confiscated.

### Rickshaw Race Creates a Sensation in Shanghai; Miss Qiong Nanqie Crowned Queen

The widely publicized rickshaw race was held at 1:00 PM yesterday. Starting from the Bund on Sanma Road, passing Nanjing Road, Jing'an Temple Road, turning into Ximor Road, and ending at Yaber Road. The champion was Qiong Nanqie (Russian nationality), rickshaw driver Jiang Ermao. Second place was Betty (Russian nationality), rickshaw driver Pan Shaowen. Third place was Miss Gong (Chinese nationality), rickshaw driver Xu Jin. After the race, an awards ceremony was held at the Yiyuan Stadium, presided over by General Wedemeyer.

At the same time, the U.S. Army and Navy held a soccer match, with brilliant performances. As a result, the Navy soccer team defeated the Army with a score of 12 to 0.

Huili Ball Stadium Crowded

At one o'clock yesterday afternoon, lacking a quarter, the Huili Ball Stadium on Yaber Road was already crowded. American military vehicles of all sizes drove straight toward the Huili Ball Stadium in twos and threes. Suddenly arriving at the stadium, thousands of American Army, Navy, and Air Force personnel were sitting neatly around the perimeter. Just after sitting down, the broadcast reported that the rickshaw race was on the way. In a few minutes, it would be arriving here. Sure enough, in less than ten minutes—at one thirty-five—the middle was shouting loudly, it was reported that the number seventeen rickshaw had reached the finish line. Immediately following was number sixteen, Miss Betty of the U.S. 10th Air Force, and the rickshaw of Miss Gong, number fifteen. The Allied troops sat down for a moment and then got up and shouted. As one by one, rickshaws arrived. The last three numbers were eleven, nineteen, and seven. Several ladies, although lagging behind, still clenched their fists and shouted for the rickshaw drivers to pull forward when they arrived at the stadium. The poor rickshaw coolies were so tired that they could not lift their heads.

The Birth of the Rickshaw Queen

The first place, "Rickshaw Miss"—Qiong Nanqie, weighing 115 pounds, represented the U.S. Port Command. She wore a long gray coat, white earrings, and black hair, with a bun in the back. Surrounded by photographers, she sat in the rickshaw holding fresh flowers. The other ladies similarly moved aside to let the camera take various shots.

The first-place rickshaw driver, Jiang Ermao, wore a grass-green woolen hat, a white sports shirt with a V-shaped "Port Quartermaster" written on the front, and shorts. This number seventeen rickshaw was indeed the most beautifully decorated, with red, blue, and white cloth covering the wheels, and the rickshaw body painted in red, blue, and white.

The announcer announced that the soccer match would begin immediately. The Army side brought out a pony, while the Navy side brought out a sheep. The American troops then raised their spirits and became very excited. The reporters' cameras also changed direction, and the soccer match began amidst the national anthems of China and the United States (sung by a Miss Diistis).

An ambulance was parked in one corner of the stadium, and the Red Cross service team was in the opposite corner. While the game was underway, the announcer told everyone the good news that the Red Cross had brought 20,000 "hot dogs" and coffee to serve. Immediately, a large group of Navy and Air Force personnel went to the Red Cross announcement site.

General Wedemeyer Presents Prizes

Halfway through the soccer match, the rickshaw miss awards ceremony was held. General Wedemeyer, General Stremeyer, and Colonel Joe, the commander of the Yangtze River Patrol, jointly presented the awards. A large silver cup was placed on a small long table, and there were eighteen other silver cups of various sizes. Each lady could receive a silver cup. The ladies lined up and went forward to receive their awards one by one. Only Miss Nanqie, wearing a short red and black plaid coat, a short black skirt, and a white shirt, sat in the rickshaw. The rickshaw driver stood in front of the rickshaw, and Colonel Joe personally placed a garland around the neck of the number seventeen rickshaw driver. Jiang Ermao was flattered and could only grin widely. Then General Wei personally handed the large silver cup to Miss Nanqie. Miss Nanqie stood up, held the silver cup, turned around to face the audience, and was photographed by the press reporters for this historic photo. The ladies also had to cope with the reporters' questions and were overwhelmed. Miss Nanqie and her rickshaw driver were also asked by the reporters to go to the grass field for official photography. The military band played, and the second half started, so the "Rickshaw Miss" went down to rest.

The First Place Rickshaw Driver Receives a Bonus

The first-place rickshaw driver received 2 million yuan in puppet currency, the second place 1.5 million yuan, and the third place 1 million yuan. The others also received prizes.

The most distinctive rickshaw in terms of color was number nine, which Miss Ribeiro of Rome sat in, painted in deep yellow.

Four Chinese ladies participated, of which Miss Gong (rickshaw number fifteen) won third place, wearing black clothes, representing the U.S. Port W Command.

Miss Huang (number six) won fourteenth place, representing the Deputy Headquarters of the Signal Room. Miss Wang (number eighteen) won sixteenth place, representing the U.S.-China Headquarters. Finally, Miss Li (number seven) representing the Signal Room, came in last.

Race Highlights

(1) Jiang Ermao, the driver of rickshaw number seventeen, won a prize of 2 million yuan in puppet currency at a speed of twenty minutes. He is from Yancheng and is 37 years old. According to him, he has been pulling rickshaws for more than fifteen years. (2) According to American customs, the last sports competition will be held on December 1st to end the various ball game programs that cannot be held during the cold winter season.

### Social Service - Launching Relief Efforts - Appealing for Donations from All Parties

Four Relief Efforts - At Least 2 Million Yuan - Impoverished People Petition - Emotions Very Sad

Our office has recently received dozens of letters daily from unemployed groups, and many have come to the office to express their grievances in person. The words of complaint in the letters are truly a tear in every word, very sad! Unemployment is indeed the most bitter encounter, and economic hardship is an especially painful pressure; in the current Shanghai life, even those with jobs feel stretched to the limit, let alone those who are idle and unproductive? Their requests: The first is to hope to find employment, the second is to hope to borrow "small loans" to do some small business to maintain their livelihood. The reasons are very proper, and the circumstances are fully sincere. We express twelve points of sympathy. Unfortunately, the donations saved in our office are very small. In addition to scholarships, combined with aid for children's education, medical aid, midwifery aid, and small loans, the total amount is only more than 60,000 yuan. If distributed to four relief efforts, it is really difficult. Without rice to cook, what can we do!

Now, everything is expensive. Speaking of "small loans," each person needs at least a loan of 5,000 yuan. If we approve loans for 100 people, we need to raise 500,000 yuan to cope with it. As for rescuing orphans without fathers or mothers and sending them to various educational institutions; rescuing the generally poor and sick and sending them to various hospitals for medical treatment and medicine; and helping poor pregnant women and sending them to contracted hospitals for delivery, each of these four relief efforts requires a minimum fund of 50,000 yuan, totaling 2 million yuan, to gradually promote each item and start our practical work. Today, with twelve ten thousand points of sincerity, I call on all enthusiastic and powerful people in the world to generously donate and contribute more, and to thank the people in need with nine prostrations!

### Bear the Cost of Rice to Protect Pulmonary Tuberculosis Patients

During the war, the incidence of pulmonary tuberculosis increased due to poor living conditions. Shanghai has a dense population, and according to statistics over the years, pulmonary tuberculosis has always ranked first, endangering national health and threatening public safety. As the Anti-Japanese War has been won and peace has returned, we should identify all latent tuberculosis factors to restore their health as soon as possible, cooperate in production, eradicate infection, and seek public safety. We hereby appeal to major hospitals to cooperate and establish the following simple rules:

(1) Anti-Tuberculosis Movement for Victory in the Anti-Japanese War.

(2) All students of Shenxin and Erbao who receive student loans and teachers who receive food aid will receive free examinations, simply by presenting their credentials directly to the hospitals. To save procedures, no registration is required in advance, and no separate notice will be issued. We hope that scholarship students will actively go for examinations and not sacrifice this free examination opportunity.

(3) All students and teachers of various schools in the city and their direct relatives, as well as the working class in the city, only need to prepare an official letter or credentials for half-price examination.

(4) For those who are found to have lung disease and need to undergo compression surgery (artificial pneumothorax), if they cannot afford it, this column will pay the hospitals a subsidy of 10,000 yuan per person per year. (According to the current situation, 10,000 yuan is only equivalent to one stone of white rice, which can be used to rescue a pulmonary tuberculosis patient as soon as possible. Is this the way to use the lowest economic power to maximize the effect!) This "Bear the Cost of Rice to Protect Pulmonary Tuberculosis Patients" movement is an urgent need for active relief. Saving one person is equivalent to saving a whole family. We hope that enthusiastic people will generously donate and contribute to promote it. We are very fortunate!

Location - Hospital Name: All major hospitals above can be visited for examination during outpatient hours.

Deadline - From now until the end of December this year. No extension will be granted.

### Letter Seeking Information on Father Lu Songnian

Dear Editor: I recently received a letter from Ms. Lu Manying of Chongqing, seeking information on her father, Lu Songnian. Her words were very sad. Please publish it in your newspaper. The Shanghai Rice Industry Guild Organizing Committee on behalf of Ms. Lu.

To the Shanghai Shenbao Social Service Department: My father, Songnian, and my brother, Congliang, were originally from Liuhe and lived in Shanghai for many years, making a living by running a rice business. (The family originally lived at No. 10 Miaolong Lane, Jing'an Temple Road, but now I don't know where they moved to? And whether the family still exists? Because the letter has been returned, I can't remember where he was originally in Shanghai. Because I was young when I escaped). Unfortunately, the "August 13th" Shanghai War broke out. I was adopted by my aunt and hastily escaped. Unfortunately, my aunt died in Jiaxing in an enemy bombing. I have suffered hardships for eight years and have come to Chongqing after many twists and turns. Although I have sent many letters home, they have all disappeared. I am lonely and drifting in a foreign land. I miss my relatives and home all the time. It is extremely painful! I hope your newspaper will publish it to find out where "Lu Songnian" is currently living? If any benevolent gentleman or friend of my father knows his whereabouts, please pass on the message or forward it through your column. I am very grateful. Sincerely, Lu Manying November 24 (Please forward to Mr. Zhou Jianguo, Police Station, Political Department, Sansheng Palace, Chongqing)

Letter from Mr. Xu Yaolin: I humbly request that when I worked at a certain company, I had a deposit of 10,000 yuan (in February of the 27th year of the Republic of China). Now, because of my resignation, the deposit will be returned. However, it is paid in legal currency at a rate of one to one. However, it is found that at that time, 10,000 yuan in legal currency could buy a thousand stones of rice, but now it can only buy one stone. The loss is too great. It is really difficult to work with people. I don't know where to appeal for a fair solution. I dare to ask you to explain in detail so that I can follow suit. Thank you.

(Editor's Note) This newspaper is not in a position to reply to this. You may ask the Industrial and Commercial Section of the Social Affairs Bureau or the Certified Public Accountants Association to study and verify it.

### Shirley Temple Gets Married

— Bing Xin

Shirley Temple, the world-famous child star, was recently married in the Wilshire Church in Hollywood.

The groom is John Agar, 24 years old, a sergeant in the U.S. Air Force. Shirley Temple met him at a banquet two years ago. After two years of passionate love, they finally got married.

For Shirley's wedding this time, her parents tried their best to save money and did not want to make a show of it. They only invited 500 old friends to participate in the wedding. However, this matter alarmed a group of movie fans, and it is unknown how many people went to see the bride. They crowded the church so tightly that the bride and groom waited for a whole fifteen minutes before squeezing out.

At the wedding banquet, a Gypsy band played music, and the guests toasted in turn, drinking a total of twenty boxes of champagne. Gifts piled up on nine large vegetable tables.

Whether Shirley plans to make a new movie after her marriage or go to college, she still cannot decide. However, this child star, who had accumulated 3 million US dollars at the age of eleven and caused a sensation at the time, has now become a new bride. From now on, she will not be Shirley Temple, but Mrs. Agar. We watched Shirley's films as a child, and it seems like it was not long ago, but now we hear that she is married. Is this not a sigh for the passage of time? A group of movie fans in the United States said: Shirley's marriage makes everyone feel old.

### The Shortest Play Review

— Hu Bei

Theater critics watch plays every day, and when they get tired of them, sometimes they see bad plays and write reviews that are quite hilarious. The famous American theater critic Atkinson once wrote the shortest play review: "A certain play was performed last night. Why?"

Another theater critic criticized an opera company, saying that it "came to town to perform after an insufficient number of postponements."

Film critic Ratner criticized the film "Panama Hattie," saying, "This film seems to be missing something, probably burial."

Theater critic Rascoe said that a certain actress's expression made him "feel sick." The next day, that actress bought a bottle of castor oil and sent it to him.

After watching a very bad play, a stranger asked theater critic Kaufman, "What did you think of the play?" Kaufman replied, "It would be unfair for me to criticize it. I watched this play under extremely unfortunate circumstances... while being pulled upwards."

### Divine Acting

— Wu Dai

The American movie star Paul Muni is particularly good at playing characters with special personalities. Once, he was performing as a representative of miners in a theater, demanding a wage increase from a heartless mine owner. At the end of the second act, after he demanded a wage increase, the mine owner refused and kicked him out. One night, Paul Muni's whole family came to see the play, and Paul Muni performed even more diligently. He used his extraordinary eloquence to describe the starvation of the miners' wives and children. At the most moving moment of the performance, the actor playing the mine owner couldn't help but be moved, bursting into tears and shouting, "Okay! Okay! You've broken my heart. Of course, your wages can be increased!" The head of the troupe, seeing the situation was not good, quickly called down the curtain. Before the start of the third act, the theater manager had to run to the front of the stage to explain that the mine owner later changed his mind and refused to increase the miners' wages.

### Charles Laughton's New Work

— Xin

"Charles Laughton has never made a bad film," this is probably a fact recognized by film fans.

In 1945, Charles Laughton made a big-budget film about 18th-century pirates, "Captain Kidd." This was adapted from a novel by Robert N. Lee, directed by Rowland V. Lee, and distributed by United Artists.

"Captain Kidd," if not said to be a sister work of "Mutiny on the Bounty," has a very grand scale. In addition to Charles Laughton, the stars include Randolph Scott, John Carradine, and Gilbert Roland; Barbara Britton is the only woman in the film. Charles Laughton plays Captain Kidd with refined acting skills, and he himself believes that this film is one of his most satisfying works in recent years.

"Captain Kidd" features a historic Spanish ship, 200 feet high and 75 feet wide, with a spacious deck. The sophistication of its manufacture and the huge amount of money spent on it are probably unmatched even by the large ships that sailed the ocean 250 years ago. However, it is only occasionally used to sail on a fake ocean in a photography studio. This historic Spanish ship first appeared in "The Sea Hawk" starring Laurence Olivier, and later in "The Black Swan," starring Tyrone Power, Laird Cregar, and Maureen O'Hara (this film is Valentino's masterpiece), and in "The Princess and the Pirate" starring Bob Hope and Victor McLaglen. The history of this ship is also an interesting little movie story!

Great drama always contains great meaning. – Jial

### Affairs of the Pear Garden

— Plum Blossom Master

Cheng Yanqiu had always had dealings with Li Shizeng, a member of the Central Committee, and was therefore hated by the enemy puppets. Twice he came south, and was insulted by puppet police and constables at the Beijing Railway Station, so he resolutely took off his opera costume and took up a hoe, becoming a farmer in the Western Hills.

Kunqu actress Wang Yuhua (Xin Yanqiu) performed at the Jixiang Theater in Beijing in 1938. Because she was implicated in a bombing case, she was falsely accused by enemy constables and subjected to severe punishment. Later, she was bailed out by Jiang Chaozong and finally escaped the clutches of the devil.

Since the death of Tan Dawang, Yu Shuyan can be called a master of his generation, but unfortunately, heaven did not grant him many years, and he also died of illness the following year.

Zhou Xinfang was quite unsuccessful before the war. After the July 7th Incident, Xinfang returned from Tianjin and performed "Dong Xiaowan" and other plays at the Carlton, which went smoothly and accumulated a fortune.

Short Story

### The Enemy (11)

— Pearl S. Buck, Translated by Zhu Qi

The cook said proudly, "The young master saves anyone because he has the skill to save people from death." She skillfully cut open the neck of a chicken, grabbed the struggling chicken, and sprinkled its blood on the roots of a wisteria flower. Blood is the best fertilizer, and the old gardener does not allow her to waste a single drop.

Yoko said worriedly, "We must think of the children. If their father is convicted of treason, what will become of them?"

They were not afraid that Hana would hear them as they spoke. Hana was standing very close to them, arranging the flowers on the western porch. She also knew that they were deliberately talking to her. She also knew that their words were correct. But there was another part of her, which she herself did not understand, which was not the fond kind of softness about the prisoner. Now she thought of him as a prisoner. Yesterday he had cried out, "At least let me tell you, my name is Tom." Even then, she had not welcomed him. She bowed slightly and distantly. She saw the hurt in his eyes, but she did not want to comfort him. He was indeed a great problem in this house.

As for Sadao, he examined the wound carefully every day. This morning, the last stitches of the wound were also removed. In two weeks, this man could be considered completely healed. Sadao returned to his office and carefully typed a letter to the police station reporting the whole thing. He typed, "On February 21st, an escaped prisoner was washed ashore in front of my house." Then he pulled open a secret drawer in his desk and put the unfinished report inside.

On the seventh day after this happened, two things happened. In the morning, all the servants packed their luggage in large bundles and left together. When Hana got up in the morning, she saw that nothing had been done in the house, the rooms had not been cleaned, and breakfast had not been prepared. She knew what this meant. She panicked, even felt terrified, but the pride of the mistress of the house prevented her from showing it at all. When they saw her in the kitchen, she solemnly bowed slightly to them, settled their wages, and thanked them for all the work they had done for her in the past. They all cried, but she did not cry.

Commercial News

### Rice Industry Association Stipulates Legal Profit of Rice Shops Not to Exceed 6%

Rice reserves have increased, and market prices have fallen by 600-700 yuan yesterday. All goods have returned to the 10,000 yuan mark. According to the Rice Industry Association, the selling price of any rice sold by rice shops must not exceed 6% of the transaction price of the rice market (excluding cartage). Extra price increases are strictly prohibited. At the same time, retail sales should be marked with the selling price so that buyers can understand at a glance.

### A Glimpse of the Market

Raw Silk: Yesterday, it was stimulated by international news and was popular as soon as it entered the market. After breaking through the 800,000 mark, there was more profit-taking, and it suffered a slight setback. It hovered in the middle of the session, but the selling pressure was still strong. It continued to weaken in the afternoon and closed slightly lower than before. The foreign exchange listing rumored that it would be implemented next week, and people's hearts fluctuated slightly. However, the overall trend was still within the range of a sideways market. Gold shop ornaments were listed at 84,000, silver at 650, and silver dollars were also fixed at 450-460. The initial dark discount was still a half corner, but later, due to the decline in the gold market, stocks, and bonds, it became sluggish again, finally about one corner and three points.

US Dollars: Initially strong and then weak, and even more unsustainable in the afternoon. Local inventories were sold off at high prices, and importers and yarn factories had enough inventory. As a result, it fell by eight yuan compared to the previous day. Hong Kong dollars, because the Shanghai-Hong Kong route has been restored and ships will soon sail to Hong Kong, were bought by many strong parties. However, the price of the gold market's US dollars fell, and buyers also stopped when the price was high. As a result, it was still better than the previous day, and the trend was quite stable.

Government Bonds: Continued to see small sideways markets, but retail investors were still stubbornly resisting, so that there were sometimes bright spots in the middle. However, the overall trend was unfavorable, and as a result, it fell back compared to the previous day. Type A fell by 30 yuan, Type B fell by 20 yuan, Type C fell by 45 yuan, Type D fell by 5 yuan, and Type E reached 80 yuan, which varied.

Chinese Stocks: Initially opened well yesterday, but retail investors continued to take profits, and the gold market was sluggish, and sellers took the opportunity to operate, so that they repeatedly advanced and retreated. The stocks also had different fortunes. Yarn factories were not as popular as Mayer, and Qinxing and Xinguang differed by nearly nine yuan. Jingfu was the most sluggish. As a result, except for Mayer and Xinguang, which still rose slightly compared to the previous day, the yarn factory was flat and Jingfu fell. Pharmacies and pharmaceutical factories, which were usually more deserted, continued to rise because of their cheap value. The situation in the morning was extremely chaotic, and the future became blurred.

Foreign Stocks: With a solid foundation and cheap value, they are easily favored by buyers. Popular stocks such as Ewo Yarns, Ewo Beer, and paper companies continued to rise. As a result, Ewo Yarns rose by 80 yuan, and the two small stocks of Ewo Beer and paper companies rose by more than 50 yuan. However, at high prices, there were many sellers, and the buying price was about half a percentage point lower.

Rice and Grain: Yesterday, rice prices were very soft due to the prevailing theory of foreign rice imports, causing both japonica and indica rice to fall by 500-600 yuan.

Yarn and Cloth: The market opened slightly yesterday, and there were some transactions. Manufacturers, seeing that the market was improving, sold off one after another. Street shops also absorbed a little inventory, forming a hovering trend.

It is rumored that a large amount of coal stored in Hongji Coal Mine in Vietnam will be transported to Shanghai soon, and the authorities are planning transportation methods, which has led to a further decline in the price of white coal and other goods. The arrival of firewood has led to weak sales, and the market continues to be weak.
