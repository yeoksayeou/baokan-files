### Publication of Basic Principles for Governing Guangdong; Governor Chu Assumed Office Yesterday Morning, Summoned Government Officials for Admonishment After Taking Over the Seal

Guangzhou, 6th (Central News Agency) - Guangdong Province Governor Chu Minyi arrived in Guangzhou City by plane on the morning of the 6th. After a brief rest, he went to the Provincial Government to take over the seal and summoned the Provincial Government officials for admonishment.

Nanjing, 6th (Central News Agency) - The newly appointed Guangdong Province Governor Chu Minyi, accompanied by his entourage, flew to Guangdong on the afternoon of the 5th to assume his new post. Those who saw him off included Minister Zhao Zunyi, Minister Chuan Shishuo, Minister Chen Jun, Dai Ce, Li Quyi, Chen Jicheng, Chen Changzu, Gao, Zhang, and the Japanese Embassy's Minister Nei, Counselor Matsumura, Counselor Ota, Secretary Ozawa, Secretary Ikeda, and Intelligence Chief Kishi. The general principles were: "Guangdong Province is the source of the revolution and the hometown of both the Father of the Nation, Mr. Sun, and the late Chairman Wang. It should be cherished in every way. Since the incident, due to transportation and geographical relations, its position among the provinces under the Father of the Nation has been relatively lower. Regarding Guangdong, we must first recognize the above two points. The former must be thoroughly understood, and the latter must be suitable. Therefore, after I arrive in Guangdong, I will make the greatest effort to implement the meaning of cherishing the people of Guangdong and to suit the situation in Guangdong. No matter when or in what environment, as long as a spark of vitality can be preserved, I will not hesitate to pay any price. As long as the people's livelihood can be stabilized, I will not be afraid of any hardship. Therefore, recognizing Guangdong Province is the basis for loving Guangdong Province, and loving Guangdong Province is the principle for protecting Guangdong Province. At the same time, we must follow the natural trend to stabilize the people's livelihood in Guangdong. Stabilizing the people's livelihood in Guangdong is the starting point for suitable Guangdong politics. The above two points can be said to be the basis and principles for my governance of Guangdong." Also, the Acting Chairman visited Mr. Chu's official residence on that day to bid him farewell.

### Valiant Counterattack by Japanese Garrison in Land and Air Battle of Balikpapan; High Morale Inflicts Painful Blows Everywhere

Southern Base, 6th (Central News Agency) - Since the enemy troops landed in Balikpapan, their strength had reached more than 15,000 by the evening of the 4th. The Japanese garrison forces launched a valiant counterattack. By that day, more than two enemy companies had been destroyed. To support their ground forces, the enemy dispatched more than 150 fighters and bombers daily to bomb and strafe the Japanese positions, and conducted slow-paced shooting at night. Under this intense bombardment by the enemy, the morale of the Japanese garrison forces grew even stronger, inflicting painful blows on the enemy everywhere they engaged them.

Objectives of Operations in Borneo

Shonan, 6th (Central News Agency) - The enemy's current Borneo operation focuses on invading resource areas, attempting to use Borneo's oil fields to supplement their fuel shortage. The steps and speed of their operations are closely related to the consolidation of bases in Okinawa and the timing and scale of operations against mainland Japan. Since June of this year, the U.S. military has used approximately 11,000 aircraft for the anti-Japanese war, consuming approximately 420,000 tons of aircraft fuel, and the ships transporting this fuel require approximately 600,000 tons. In addition, the fuel supply required by the mechanized units needed to support the air force is even greater. For example, in the recent four months alone, the fuel required for naval operations has reached 1.5 million tons. This huge amount of fuel is entirely dependent on supplies from the United States and the Middle East, which is time-consuming and labor-intensive. The output of Borneo's oil fields can supply up to 100% of the total required amount, but due to distance, this can save some ships. Therefore, this operation was launched, which can increase shipping efficiency several times compared to transporting fuel from the United States or the Middle East. Therefore, Borneo is very important to the enemy's fuel resource supply.

### Japanese Army Deploys Strong Defenses in Hong Kong

Hong Kong, 6th (Central News Agency) - It has been over a year since the enemy, Britain and the United States, clamored for a landing in South China. Recently, this propaganda has intensified, claiming that the opportunity for landing in Hong Kong, Xiamen, and other places is approaching. The Japanese side has long taken comprehensive measures to deploy strong defenses in Hong Kong and construct underground fortresses under the granite of the entire island. At the same time, the morale of the Japanese army is extremely high, and they are waiting in full battle array, ready to annihilate the enemy.

### Air Raids in Various Parts of Japan

Tokyo, 6th (Central News Agency) - Led by a reconnaissance aircraft, approximately 90 fighter planes from the Iwo Jima base, divided into three groups, invaded Tokyo from near Choshi at noon on the 6th and attacked Ibaraki, Chiba, and Saitama, then departed after 15 minutes. Also, between 10:00 AM and noon, five aircraft and three aircraft operated in the southern part of the Izu Islands and Kujukuri.

### U.S. and Australian Authorities Announce Land, Sea, and Air Force Losses

Lisbon, 6th (Central News Agency) - Washington dispatch: The U.S. Army and Navy announced that since the start of the war to date, the losses suffered by the U.S. military were 1,030,693, an increase of 6,258 from the previous week.

Lisbon, 6th (Central News Agency) - Guam dispatch: The command of Admiral Nimitz announced that the casualties of the U.S. military in the Okinawa operations totaled 46,319.

Lisbon, 6th (Central News Agency) - San Francisco dispatch: Mr. Ford of the Australian Air Force Department announced on the 3rd the losses suffered by the Australian Air Force since the start of the war as follows: Since the start of the war, the Australian Air Force has suffered more than 13,800 casualties, half of which were suffered in the European theater. Specifically, there were 6,500 in Europe, 4,700 in the Southwest Pacific, 1,500 in the Middle East, 370 in the Far East, 300 in Burma, and 430 elsewhere.

### Voices of Peace Among the People in Chongqing

Mainland Base, 6th (Central News Agency) - Chiang Kai-shek recently said, "The war against Japan will end within the next 18 months," exaggerating to win over the hearts of the people under his rule. However, according to various intelligence gathered locally, the voices of peace are very high in Chongqing. The youth and intellectuals there do not want the U.S. military to land in the coastal areas of China and are enthusiastically discussing the ceasefire of the Chongqing army and the withdrawal of Japanese troops. It is said that the ruling authorities are deeply afraid that this phenomenon will spread to various places and are suppressing these opinions. Although Chongqing calls for resistance, the hearts of the people under its rule are the opposite. The reasons are nothing more than the following:

If the Chinese mainland becomes the decisive battlefield between Japan and the United States,

### Lieutenant General Shino and Three Other Officers Killed in Action

Announced Yesterday by the Sasebo Naval District

Tokyo, 6th (Central News Agency) - The Sasebo Naval District announced on the 6th the list of four Japanese officers who had died in battle: Lieutenant General Shino Katsukiyo, Major General Noguchi Gozaburo, Major General Hashimoto Uro, and Major General Yamauchi Teisho. It is inevitably difficult to avoid the devastation of Chinese territory and the destruction of facilities, preventing the progress of China's reconstruction. If we rely entirely on foreign forces to resist Japan, there will be no guarantee for the completeness of China's sovereignty after the war. All sectors of military, political, economic, and cultural affairs will be eroded by foreign forces. Even in Britain, where women are highly respected, the U.S. military is extremely licentious. If they invade the Chinese mainland, they will disrupt the pure bloodline of the Chinese nation. In particular, the intellectuals and young people who call for maintaining the purity of the national bloodline demand the immediate withdrawal of the U.S. military. Furthermore, reviewing China's modern history over the past hundred years since the Opium War, emotional warfare against Japan has only led China to destruction. This view is also quite persuasive. Recent broadcasts from Chongqing even echoed this sentiment, saying, "The Japanese army still has millions of elite soldiers, and even though some losses have been suffered, they still have considerable naval strength to cope with future battles." However, this phenomenon is not only prevalent in Chongqing. It is said that similar arguments are also occurring within the front-line Chongqing army in Hunan and Guangxi.

Editorial

### Analysis of Chongqing's Diplomacy with the Soviet Union

We have analyzed Song Ziwen's mission to the Soviet Union, believing it to be nothing more than the following three points: Improving Chongqing-Soviet relations, mediating Chongqing-Communist relations, and discussing the issue of the decisive battle against Japan. Now, we further analyze Chongqing's diplomacy with the Soviet Union as follows:

While improving relations between Chongqing and the Soviet Union is possible, the price to be paid will certainly be high. Not long ago, the Sixth National Congress of Chongqing, on the one hand, resolved to promote diplomacy with the Soviet Union, and on the other hand, issued a declaration denying the independence of the Mongolian People's Republic. Obviously, there is an unavoidable contradiction in this. And the fact can also prove that Song Ziwen's diplomacy has encountered hidden reefs in Moscow. Song Ziwen had not been in Moscow for a few days when the Prime Minister of the Mongolian People's Republic also followed. According to the Sino-Soviet Treaty of 1924, Outer Mongolia is a protected territory of China. According to the resolution of the Sixth National Congress of Chongqing, the independence of Outer Mongolia should be denied. However, if Stalin uses the issues of Outer Mongolia or Xinjiang as conditions for exchange, improving Chongqing-Soviet relations will not be easy.

Can Chongqing-Communist relations be resolved by leveraging international forces? The United States can be said to have completely failed in mediating Chongqing-Communist relations. To pressure Chongqing to ease relations with the Communists aroused strong resistance from Chongqing, the Stilwell incident being an example. To unite Chongqing's forces to suppress the Communists resulted in the Harllee line becoming the target of condemnation by the Communists. Therefore, the United States thought of asking the Soviet Union to mediate from Chongqing. In Chongqing, there seems to be no other way than to negotiate with Moscow. However, although the Soviet Union has not provided practical assistance to the Communists in recent years, it is still sympathetic to the Communists. If the Soviet Union proposes the formation of a coalition government as the basic plan for mediating Chongqing-Communist relations, why would Song Ziwen need to go to Moscow?

Chongqing, the United States and Britain all hope that the war against Japan can end in the near future, because the longer the war drags on, the more unfavorable it is. Therefore, they are asking the Soviet Union to also participate in the war against Japan. The United States has already done a lot of enticing work on this issue, and this Three-Headed Conference may also discuss it. It can be said that Song Ziwen's mission contains the intentions of both Chongqing and the United States. However, after the end of the war against Germany, the Soviet Union has not yet recovered and what it needs most now is recuperation. At the same time, the prolongation of the war against Japan by Chongqing, the United States and Britain is a good opportunity for the Soviet Union to build up its strength.

### Shanghai Branch of the New Association Held a Current Affairs Reporting Discussion Yesterday; Minister Kuwahara Attended and Gave Guidance

The Shanghai Branch of the China Press Association held its fourth current affairs discussion meeting at the Mu Hua Club yesterday afternoon (the 6th). Naval Minister Kuwahara of the allied forces was invited to attend and give guidance. Those present included Minister Kuwahara, Lieutenant Matsumoto, Mr. Uzaki, and more than 20 representatives from various newspapers in the city, including Chen Binwu, Chen Riping, Lu Feng, and Yang Guangzheng. The main points of the discussion were as follows:

(Question) What are the trends in the war situation after the Battle of Okinawa?

(Answer) In the Battle of Okinawa, the brave attacks of our army's special forces inflicted huge losses on the enemy. Although it has now come to an end, the enemy will not be able to immediately continue large-scale operations after being wounded. Currently, both Japan and the United States can be said to be actively preparing. Japan has turned important locations into fortresses to defend the mainland.

On the U.S. side, they have started moving troops from Europe since May. Apart from a portion being transferred back to their home country, a portion is being directly transferred to the Pacific War. However, this preparation requires a considerable period of time. What can be accelerated is only the air force. Therefore, air raids on mainland Japan or mainland China may be more frequent than in the past. At the same time, ground troops are gradually concentrating in the Philippines. However, large-scale operations in the future must be coordinated with the British and Chongqing armies, so the preparation time is longer. A truly large-scale decisive battle is expected to begin in the spring of next year.

In the future, the actions of enemy aircraft may be more active, but the enemy's propaganda about controlling the air and sea is completely inaccurate. For example, the "Kontor Vandi" once had water leaking in, and its speed was slow and the target was large, but it safely arrived in Japan from Shanghai. Now Japan is engaged in transportation work, which is a counter-evidence. Other ships are still coming and going constantly.

(Question) What is the future development of the enemy's new offensive in Borneo, South Pacific?

(Answer) The enemy has started offensives in Tarakan, Borneo, and Balikpapan. The significance of this is that, on the one hand, the supply line is too afraid, and they want to obtain a base for kerosene close to Japan. On the other hand, they want to cut off the connection between Japan and the South Seas. However, this is a sign of the war becoming prolonged. The enemy paid a great price on small islands such as Iwo Jima and Okinawa, and they will suffer even more severe losses when operating on the large island of Borneo. Perhaps the US and British troops will echo each other, and new battles will also occur in Malaysia, Shonan, Java, Sumatra and other places in the future.

(Question) Can you elaborate on Song Ziwen's visit to the Soviet Union?

(Answer) There were rumors of Song Ziwen visiting the Soviet Union when the San Francisco Conference was held, but Song Ziwen was sent back to Chongqing from San Francisco and then went to Moscow. Of course, there was a pre-arranged plan and he listened to Chiang Kai-shek's instructions. Now that Song Ziwen has met with Stalin, the issues discussed probably include the KMT-CPC issue and the Far East question after the war. The former is because the allied forces must contact the Yan'an army when landing on the mainland, so there must be contact in advance. According to foreign commentators, when the allied forces land on the mainland, there will definitely be various disputes with the Yan'an army, and this point is quite reasonable. As for the latter, the Soviet Union is planning to recuperate after the end of the war against Germany and will not be easily instigated. Even if the Soviet Union agrees to Zhu Ziwen's mediation of the Yan'an issue, it will definitely make significant demands, such as the Xinjiang Province or the Outer Mongolia issue.

(Question) What is the relationship between the Three-Headed Conference and the Greater East Asia War situation? (Answer) The issues discussed at the Three-Headed Conference probably include the following three: the final decision on the European handling issue; the issue of weak countries that are not suitable for discussion at the San Francisco Conference; the issue of Japan. Among these three, we are most concerned about the issue of Japan. The United States has repeatedly tried to win over the Soviet Union to participate. The main reason is to shorten the war and avoid the difficulties of a long-term war. As for the Soviet Union's attitude, although the Neutrality Treaty has been notified for abolition, it still maintains friendly relations with Japan, and the Soviet Union has no intention of driving its citizens to war after a long war.

### Japanese Local Military Supply Officials Held a Joint Conference to Review Issues of Enhancing Production

Tokyo, 6th (Central News Agency) - The joint conference of Japanese local military supply bureau chiefs was held at the Ministry of Military Affairs on the 4th and 5th.

Mobilizing Students to Reclaim Mountains and Forests

Tokyo, 6th (Central News Agency) - To ensure food resources during the decisive battle on the mainland, the Japanese government is mobilizing students nationwide on a large scale to actively reclaim flatlands and highlands after logging. On the 4th, the directors of the Agriculture and Commerce Ministry's Agriculture and Administration Bureaus, along with the director of the Ministry of Education's General Affairs Bureau, jointly issued a document to local officials, ordering them to form agricultural support teams in accordance with the decision made at the meeting in March of this year, mobilizing agricultural school students, higher-grade students of rural national schools, secondary school students, or some university students, for full-year service.

Grand welcomes are being prepared everywhere. Major train stations and ports are preparing special storage depots to meet the needs of demobilized personnel, and various transportation facilities are also being prepared to give priority to demobilized personnel. The Leningrad Trade Union is preparing to send demobilized personnel in need of rest and recuperation to Karelia Isthmus, as well as scenic rest areas and sanatoriums in the suburbs of Leningrad. Soviet inspectors have issued orders instructing their subordinates to supervise the strict implementation of the demobilization law at all times.

Labour Party leader Morrison is also attacking the Conservative Party's strong fortress in southern London, claiming, "The election work is quite beneficial to me." In northern Airdrie (where former Prime Minister Churchill suffered his first protest demonstration while touring London), current Minister of the Navy Bracken is competing for a seat with Labor Party candidate Lieutenant General MacFarlane, which will cause a fierce battle. There is Labor Party leader Dalton, who will serve as the Minister of Commerce in the Allied Cabinet, who has prophesied, "The country will tend to the Labour Party.

### Mother Zhou, Madam Ma, Passes Away: Memorial Service Tomorrow at Jade Buddha Temple on Jiangning Road

Mother Zhou, Madam Ma, passed away in Guiyang on June 25 this year. When the sad news came, the Zhou family was filled with grief. A memorial service will be held tomorrow (the 8th) at the Jade Buddha Temple on Jiangning Road in this city, and Deputy Director Zhou himself will write a memorial essay, which is recorded as follows:

Memorial Essay Written by Deputy Director Zhou

On this sixth day of July in the thirty-fourth year of the Republic of China, your unfilial son, Fohai, tearfully makes offerings before the spirit tablet of his late mother, Madam Ma: Alas! Madam passed away in Guiyang on June 25. After six days, the spirit was moved and temporarily placed in Hongfangdi. Now, after accomplishing the main affairs, we respectfully perform the family memorial ceremony. It has been twelve days since Madam's passing. Recalling the death of my late father, it has been thirty-six years since then. In these thirty-six years, your bereft orphan has relied closely on the love of his compassionate mother to serve as the master of his heart and as the standard for his conduct and actions. From now on, your unfilial son will forever be a person without parents. Oh, Heaven, how painful! Recalling the days of my childhood, the only ones who surrounded Madam's knees were your son and his younger brother and sister. My late father went to Fujian and Hai, and with empty sleeves, he could not fulfill his aspirations and passed away. Madam endured hardship and self-sacrifice, without the concern for the family's livelihood, and she was only afraid that she could not fulfill her duties to the clan and party. She only feared that she would fail in raising and educating your unfilial sons. Those who were unpolished and childish, those who were the source of constant smiles and affection, are forever etched in my heart, vividly before my eyes. Your unfilial son is nearing fifty, floating and sinking in the sea of humanity, entering and leaving officialdom. People everywhere say that I have been able to do this because of the inspiration of Madam's spirit. This is what your unfilial son will benefit from for the rest of his life. Alas, Madam smiled and left peacefully, was it a dream? Could it be foretold? In the first year of the Republic, your unfilial son entered the county's advanced elementary school with flying colors, and Madam was overjoyed to hear of it. That year, your unfilial son declared his allegiance to the Owenite school rules, but still could not get a leave of absence. So, I carried my luggage and went to Changsha. After a painful admonition, Madam generously provided funds so that your unfilial son could finally express his governance a little. Then, your unfilial son returned to the county town, and with the support of his teachers and friends, he entered the county high school. He stood in the snow to seek knowledge and respectfully received instruction. The happiest and most joyful time of my life was really at this time. Your unfilial son's determination to study hard began here. In the sixth year of the Republic, with the help of teachers and friends, your unfilial son suddenly planned to study abroad in the East. Madam, driven by the virtuous desire to see her son become famous, suppressed her desire to keep him by her side and finally arranged his luggage so that he could depart. On the day of parting, Madam wept secretly in the kitchen. Alas, from then on, your unfilial son, seeking knowledge and serving the country, traveled north, south, east, and west, and could not stay by her side for long, and was always absent from filial duties. The misfortune of fate is indeed so cruel. In the seventh year of the Republic, due to circumstances, students studying in the East were ordered to return to the country. Your unfilial son's patriotism came from his nature, so he went from Tokyo to Andong to seek help from his fellow villagers. When he arrived in Andong, there was no place for him to stay, so he returned to the country, but the road ahead was vast. At this time, his studies had not yet been completed, but he jumped into the sea to make a living. With the love of his compassionate mother, he was even more courageous to move forward. So, he returned to Tokyo, from one high school to seven high schools, and then to Kyoto Imperial University. Fortunately, he completed his studies and became established. If it were not for the dream revelation of his compassionate mother, how could your unfilial son have achieved what he has today? Your unfilial son, together with the late Chairman Ren Gong and current Chairman Chen Gong, has vowed to promote peace for eight years. Your unfilial son understands the great meaning of the Three Principles of the People for building the country. He deeply knows that the party cannot be divided, and the country must be unified. Merely because of the differences between peace and war, there are the frictions of Wu and Shu. The flames of war welcome the sky, and the people's livelihood is impoverished. How can we save the people from water and fire and bring them to peace and tranquility? How can we rebuild the country from the ashes of scorched earth? The process is difficult, and the effort is especially hard. Your unfilial son, with his humble body, shoulders arduous responsibilities. When encountering difficulties, I cannot help but call out to my parents, but from now on, even if I cry to the sky, Madam will not respond to me. Alas, how painful! Since leaving home in the sixth year of the Republic, your unfilial son has not been able to set foot in his homeland again. Every time I think of returning home, there are always unexpected obstacles. In addition, due to military or political reasons, news from home has not been communicated often. Madam hoped for the success of your unfilial son's career and worried about the safety of your unfilial son. Joy, sorrow, fear, and horror, how can they be described? In these thirty years, she was welcomed to the capital twice. Madam lived a simple and comfortable life, but often, because she missed her homeland, she returned home quickly. After saying goodbye in the capital in the twenty-fifth year, the war broke out in the twenty-sixth year. In the winter, she returned to Hunan and eagerly thought of visiting her relatives. Hearing the news of the German envoy's mediation, she hurried back to Hubei, and was unable to pay her respects to Madam's face. Although I was on Chairman Wang's plane from Kunming to Hanoi for seven years, the first illusion that climbed me came into my mind, I wonder if I would not see my mother again in the future, and I also know that today's children's illusion is also for Bai Ye. Since the eighth year, I have sent people back to Hunan several times, eagerly thinking of welcoming Madam to Beijing and Shanghai. Madam was old and afraid of traveling far, and she wanted to go but stopped again and again. So, there was a trip to Guizhou, and she finally died while thinking of her hometown. If your unfilial younger brother, Fosheng, is still alive today, Madam would have been able to taste the soup personally and rely on him to take care of the funeral arrangements, so that your unfilial sister, Fozhen, would not have to bear the burden alone, and the kindness of hard work could not be repaid, but the heart of a child would be at ease. And who knows that Fosheng's death has been sixteen years today. Just as I was about to get excited, I was little sad, and I thought of the pain of the curtain. Alas, my grandsons, Youhai, have grown up and know literature and history, and my granddaughter, Shuhai, has married into the Qi family, and my granddaughter, Huanhai, has been engaged to the Wu family. They will surely miss and point to themselves. This is the blessing of Madam's spirit. Your unfilial son is worried about his remaining life, and the disease is personally questioned. I only have to devote my life's energy and effort to the great cause of the nation and the country, so that I can honor my ancestors and comfort my parents in the afterlife. Alas, I look to the west from afar, and my luck is squatting seedling, the bowl is still there, the smile is difficult to make, Wu Tian is at its extreme. Grief and sorrow, I hope that on the day of the tomb, I will respectfully present the text of the inscription. Alas, I respectfully ask for your acceptance.

### Japanese Defense Line Strengthened in Eastern Burma

Since the enemy troops invaded Wa City, the Burmese war situation has shown a great change in the two months. As for the key to the change, it was the action of the powerful mobile unit of the enemy that crossed the Nianhe River south of Bairake in mid-February, and then on February 27, moved aggressively towards the center of the Burmese plain, Meiktila. This place is the key point of the Japanese army's Irrawaddy interception line, which winds for more than 100 kilometers. The enemy's invasion of this place was a risky move. Therefore, after the Japanese army's continuous counterattacks in early March, the enemy's air force was on the verge of annihilation. In addition to mobilizing air force from other areas to cover the flying force in Meiktila, the enemy also attempted to forcibly cross the river at various crossing points on the Irrawaddy River. Finally, due to the Japanese army's automatic withdrawal from Wa City, the enemy troops, under the cover of airplanes, used tanks as a vanguard to invade Jiaren, about 40 kilometers west of Sagaing, and continued to invade Miha, 20 kilometers west of it. At this point, the war situation in the central Burmese plain was in a state that was difficult to predict.

In addition, in response to the Irrawaddy decisive battle, the newly organized 30th and 38th divisions of the Chongqing government and the 80th and 36th divisions of the British Indian Army also went south. This army, together with the 11th East Philippine Division on the west bank of the Irrawaddy River south of Pangu, the 25th British Indian Division on the coast centered on Aen, and the 26th British Indian Division on the front of Ramree Island and Tongkapu, totaled a considerable force.

Taking back Wa City has been the enemy's long-cherished wish for four years. Now that they have achieved their wish, they will further hope to take back Yangon, which is expected. By mid-April, after the enemy troops along the Irrawaddy River had completed their reorganization, they began to move south with the mechanized troops in Meiktila as the vanguard. Although they suffered heavy losses from the Japanese army's fierce attacks, they gradually advanced south along the Wa City Avenue, passing through Yehmessen and arriving at Pinmana on the 19th of the same month. At this time, the rainy season was approaching, and the terrain near Tintaung was dangerous due to the hills blocking the east and west. If the enemy troops do not pass through this dangerous place before the rainy season comes, it will be difficult to advance into Yangon. Therefore, they hurriedly changed their tactics, avoided the vanguard of the Japanese army's counterattack, and used mobile tanks to advance in two routes, speeding south along the left and right sides of Wa City Avenue. By the 22nd, their tank troops had advanced to the vicinity of Biyo south of Tonggu. At this point, the enemy's air force once again launched a large-scale offensive to cover the mechanized troops advancing south towards Yangon. At the same time, parachute troops and a part of the Indian Ocean fleet began a general attack. By May 4, according to their radio broadcasts, a part of the troops had invaded Yangon City. But before this, the two sides had engaged in bloody battles near Peku, and the elite of the Japanese army made the enemy shed a lot of blood around Yangon. Moreover, the enemy's southward advance was too hurried, so from the north, through Taji, Pinya, and the area along the east-west line of Wa City Avenue in Tonggu, the enemy's rear was not only subjected to fierce attacks by the Japanese army retreating from the south bank of the Irrawaddy River, but even if the ambition to invade Yangon could be realized, it was indeed the original plan for the Japanese army to make the enemy shed a lot of blood. The enemy's losses were not small.

From this point of view, the Burmese front has close relations with Malaysia, Thailand, the Philippines, and South China. In crushing the enemy's attempts to invade East Asia from the land, it has a major mission. Today, the Japanese army is ensuring the natural defense lines of the Sithang and Salween rivers, and intercepting the enemy, and will definitely give them a heavy blow.

### Central Reserve Special Bank Notes To Be Used As Cash: Silver Industry Representatives Discuss Relieving Cash Panic

Since the Central Reserve Bank cancelled the exchange of bank notes for 64 clearing banks and members of the Silver Union and Silver Bank on the 3rd of this month, all banks have opened parallel immediate bank notes for payment to customers, except for cash. It is stipulated that the special bank notes of the Central Reserve Bank can be transferred in writing and exchanged in the same way as other documents. At the same time, the Central Reserve Bank has increased the daily distribution of cash to various banks and banks, (salaries of employees and all expenses are paid separately with special cash) according to the total amount of deposits of each bank and bank as much as possible. , the wind of cash panic and stationing has not subsided slightly, and the general unscrupulous businessmen's absorption of cash and discount situations still exist.

Subsequently, Ye Fuyu of the Continental Bank, Wu Zhai of the Jincheng Bank, 韾 Zhunku representative Shen 韾 韾 韾 expressed their opinions, hoping that the Central Reserve Bank would give as much cash as possible for collection, and the financial difficulties such as the lack of cash payment for various banks and banks, and the various situations such as the attempt of general small financial institutions to seek profit discount.

Consultation Results

The above measures will soon be announced and implemented by the Central Reserve Authority.

### First Batch of Coal for Factory Relief Arrives in Shanghai Yesterday: Ministry of Industry Implements Coal-for-Electricity Exchange

To provide coal for civilian use and alleviate the electricity shortage for factories in Shanghai, the Ministry of Industry established a Coal Mining Production Increase Supervision Committee in Nanjing to oversee coal mining and transportation. Its Shanghai office officially opened on July 1st at 266 Beijing Road, 5th floor. Mr. Jun, Director of the Ministry's Fisheries Administration, concurrently serves as the Director of the Shanghai office. A reporter recently interviewed Director Liu at the office, who stated: "As reported in newspapers on the 4th of this month, the first batch of coal transported to Shanghai by the Ministry of Industry has arrived. This coal is produced and transported by the Coal Mining Production Increase Supervision Committee itself, resulting in lower costs. If we transport coal to Shanghai with all our strength, it will amount to only about 1,000 tons per month. Calculating at an average exchange rate of 400 kilowatt-hours per ton, the total will be 400,000 kilowatt-hours, which is still a drop in the bucket. Therefore, Minister Chen of our Ministry recently ordered Vice Minister Wang, along with Director Tao Guojun of this committee, to come to Shanghai to purchase new ships. Preliminary agreements have been reached for two ships, and they should be available for use next month. Director Tao is also discussing transportation with trucking companies to increase capacity. If this plan does not encounter unexpected obstacles, the electricity problem for factories in Shanghai should be satisfactorily resolved, and the production industry in Shanghai will have good prospects."

The officers of the Third Division of each branch bureau must concentrate their efforts on arresting armed criminals and collecting intelligence. If the number of officers in each branch bureau is insufficient to implement comprehensive measures, they may request assistance from the police force. Simultaneously, each branch bureau chief must report the implementation plans and results specific to their jurisdiction to the Director of the Third Division daily, who will then inform the Bureau Chief.

Regarding the collection of student fees and the treatment of faculty and staff in schools in this city, with the exception of municipal schools which are clearly regulated by the authorities, the Municipal Bureau of Education is rumored to have drafted provisional regulations for all private primary and secondary schools. The main content is as follows: The amount of student fees collected by each school in the 34th academic year (starting from August of the 34th year) should be determined by the principal in consultation with the school board, taking into account the previous semester's fees and the economic situation of the majority of students' families, and submit a payment plan to the Municipal Bureau of Education for record-keeping. Each school's collection of tuition fees should comply with the Ministry of Education's order and not collect rice or convert rice into tuition fees. If any school is found to be in violation of the Ministry's order by the Bureau of Education, it will be submitted to the Municipal Government for punishment. Illegal income must not be used as the total operating expenses of the school.

### Director Xu of the Construction Bureau Answers Questions on Transportation, Water, and Electricity at Yesterday's Regular Press Conference

The regular press conference organized by the Municipal Propaganda Office was held at the Municipal Government yesterday (7th) at 10:30 am. Director Xu of the Municipal Construction Bureau attended and answered questions from reporters from various newspapers regarding transportation, roads, and water and electricity issues in detail. The details are as follows:

Construction of the Shanghai-Suzhou Highway

(Question) What is the progress of the construction of the Shanghai-Suzhou Highway? When will it be officially open to traffic?

(Answer) For the bridges on the Shanghai-Suzhou Highway, the contractor initially encountered difficulties in purchasing wood. The wood is now being supplied by the Highway Engineering Office of our Bureau, which has already sawn and matched the materials. The bridges on the Shanghai-Suzhou line should be completed by the beginning of August. Most of the road surface materials, such as crushed bricks and gravel, have also been transported by water to the construction site. They are now being transported along the line by military trucks. If the weather is good and there are no special changes, the entire line should be completed by mid-August.

Digging of Wells to Start Next Week

(Question) Shanghai has a large population, and the water source issue is extremely important. If there is a disruption to the water supply, the impact will be significant. We heard that your bureau is planning to dig wells. What are the specific plans? Has this project started yet?

(Answer) Our bureau has finalized the well project and signed a contract with the contractor. Work should begin next week. We plan to dig 20 wells. These wells are not rural wells and do not require the use of pumps. We will still use the old method, with wooden frames, pulleys, and two buckets. Although we are using the old method externally, the internal construction will be completely modern to ensure that the water source is exceptionally clean. The locations will also be convenient for most citizens to use.

Trolley and Public Horse-Drawn Carriage Issues

(Question) Currently, the trolleys operating in the city center all travel from west to east, while the No. 17 and 18 trackless trolleys that run from south to north have been suspended for a long time. Can your bureau find a way to promote their resumption to benefit the citizens?

(Answer) The No. 17 and 18 trackless trolleys have been suspended due to electricity restrictions, which has caused inconvenience to the citizens. We will do our best to contact the relevant authorities to resume operation as soon as possible to facilitate transportation.

(Question) When will the public horse-drawn carriage service be realized?

(Answer) Regarding the public horse-drawn carriage service in this city, the representative of the initiators, Lu Zhaoyin, submitted a request on May 7th of this year to establish the service, along with sample carriage drawings, business plans, and route fare schedules. Our bureau believes that this is an innovative initiative that will benefit transportation, so we forwarded it to the Municipal Government for approval. We heard that the Municipal Government, for the sake of prudence, has ordered the Municipal Police Bureau to review the matter and report back. We will implement the plan after receiving instructions.

Water and Electricity Issues Under Discussion

(Question) What are the most pressing issues for Shanghai's infrastructure that your bureau is currently facing?

(Answer) The most pressing issues for the citizens of Shanghai are water and electricity. Our bureau is paying close attention to these issues. Regarding the water supply issue, Minister Chuan and Vice Minister Wang of the Ministry of Construction have come to Shanghai to discuss with relevant parties about increasing the supply. Our bureau has also had several consultations with relevant agencies and appears to have reached a satisfactory solution. We understand that the relevant agencies have agreed to increase the amount of coal allocated to the water and electricity companies, and it may soon be possible to restore the water consumption to the level of January of this year. Properties Managed by the Former Committee Can Be Returned Upon Proof

The former Municipal Government's Property Management Committee was ordered to be dissolved at the end of February this year, and its functions were merged into the Finance Bureau. The bureau has been working hard to reorganize and handle the remaining tasks. If citizens can provide conclusive proof of ownership of properties managed by the former committee and request the termination of management, the bureau will approve the return of the properties after careful verification. Recently, citizens Mei Songxian applied for the return of No. 2 Jinbo, Shujin Road, Nanshi; [Omission] Xiaoyan applied for the return of No. 221 Zhuhang Wharf, Nanshi; [Omission] Biao applied for the return of No. 225 Hongqiao Road and No. 1055 Yu [Omission] Road; [Omission] Ge applied for the return of No. 23 [Omission] Chuan Road; Huang Zengfu applied for the return of No. 2933 [Omission] Chuan Road; and Xu Qiujing applied for the return of No. 16 Fangxie Road. The Finance Bureau has verified that these properties are eligible for the termination of Yu Property Management and has reported this to the Municipal Government.

To implement the gold special tax, the Municipal Finance Bureau convened a meeting on the afternoon of the 4th with 40 designated merchants authorized to trade in gold and collect the special tax to discuss tax collection matters. It was decided that the tax will be implemented today. It is understood that all merchants will comply with the regulations and collect a tax of 2.5 per thousand from both buyers and sellers of gold. However, merchants who have not been designated and registered are prohibited from trading in gold to show restriction. The bureau has dispatched several secret investigators to investigate various merchants.

These stamps can be used to pay for any mail and parcel postage fees at their temporary selling price, and are not limited to paying for airmail postage fees.

### Trolley Fares Adjusted Again

The Shanghai Urban Transportation Company is experiencing difficulties with change due to the shortage of 10-yuan small-denomination notes. To avoid the trouble of giving change, the company has readjusted trolley fares based on units of 100 yuan, effective immediately. The adjusted fares are as follows: Regular fare: 200 yuan per ride. Full-route monthly pass: 24,000 yuan per month for adults, 12,000 yuan for children. Single-route monthly pass: 10,500 yuan per month for adults, 5,300 yuan for children.

### Watching the Famous Dance Drama "The Hunchback of Notre Dame"

— Gao Yan

The famous romantic dance drama "The Hunchback of Notre Dame," sponsored by the Shanghai Music Association, has been performed at the [Omission] Xin Theater since Thursday of this week, with both daytime and nighttime performances until Monday, the 9th. This is the last dance drama performance of this year's music season. Those who love dance drama should not miss this opportunity.

"The Hunchback of Notre Dame" - or "Notre Dame de Paris" - is an immortal masterpiece by the great French 19th-century Romantic Hugo. The story of this lengthy and complex literary work, like his other masterpiece "Les Misérables," has long been admired by lovers of literature. Even in Shanghai, the silent film era's Lon Chaney and the sound film's Charles Laughton have both played the lead role in this drama. The image of the hunchbacked Quasimodo is probably still deeply imprinted in the minds of many. As for the stage play, the performance was also quite good, but I won't go into detail here.

This time, the "Hunchback of Notre Dame" at the Lanxin Theater is a pure dance drama - Ballet, a mime woven from dance, music, and expression. It has no dialogue or singing, which is its characteristic feature. The performers are members of the Russian Ballet Troupe from the sea, and the Shanghai Symphony Orchestra performs the music. The cooperation between skilled dance experts and a perfect musical troupe in performing a moving literary masterpiece will surely satisfy audiences artistically.

The entire play is in three acts and four scenes, with flawless sets and costumes. In the first act, the hunchback Quasimodo appears, and the beggars celebrate the Festival of Fools. The Gypsy girl Esmeralda and Captain Phoebus fall in love at first sight, and all the important characters of the play appear one after another. The second act is the highlight of the dance program. The lead actress, Esmeralda (played by Bobinina), and the lead actor, [Omission] Lujin (playing the captain), have both made profound achievements in dance. Their powerful application and beautiful performance have reached the level of perfection, winning continuous applause from the audience.

The third act is the climax of the entire play in terms of the story. When Esmeralda is hanged on the gallows, the priest Frollo is pushed off the [Omission] by Quasimodo and falls to the ground. Hugo's description of how the ugly man—as if a giant had been slaughtered, forever unable to tidy himself up—felt is truly heart-stirring. He muttered, "Ah, they are all those I love!" Of course, this dance mime did not perform it in this way, and the hunchback would not speak, but it used music and martial arts to stir up this wave in the hearts of the audience.

The sets are beautiful, and the costumes are gorgeous, all of the highest quality. The art director, [Omission] Yiren, the performance and dance director [Omission] Guan Ersiqi (who plays the priest Frollo in the play), and the music director [Omission] Ciji [Omission] Jun have contributed the most to the success of the play.

### The Decisive Stage—The Japanese Navy's Top Commanders

As the war enters its decisive stage, the Japanese Navy's highest command has been selected and further strengthened, completing the most formidable lineup since the establishment of the Japanese Navy. According to a May 29th announcement by the Japanese Naval Ministry, Grand Admiral Koshirō Oikawa, the former Chief of the Naval General Staff, has been honorably appointed as a Military Councilor. He will be succeeded by Grand Admiral Soemu Toyoda, the Commander-in-Chief of the Navy, Commander-in-Chief of the Combined Fleet, and Commander of the Maritime Escort Fleet. The vacancies for Commander-in-Chief of the Navy, Commander-in-Chief of the Combined Fleet, and Commander of the Maritime Escort Fleet will be filled by Vice Admiral Jisaburō Ozawa, the Vice Chief of the Naval General Staff, who will be responsible for commanding all of the Navy's frontline forces. Furthermore, the vacancy for Vice Chief of the Naval General Staff will be filled by Vice Admiral Takijirō Ōnishi, the commander of the naval air units at the non-island naval base. It is noted that Grand Admiral Toyoda, the Commander-in-Chief of the Navy and Commander-in-Chief of the Combined Fleet, has been active at sea for a long time. His appointment as Chief of the Naval General Staff will allow his valuable frontline experience to be utilized in military planning, which will undoubtedly make a significant contribution to the decisive battle on the home front. The new Commander-in-Chief of the Navy, Vice Admiral Jisaburō Ozawa, and the new Vice Chief of the Naval General Staff, Vice Admiral Takijirō Ōnishi, are both authorities on aviation. Vice Admiral Ōnishi has established great achievements in naval air tactics in the waters off Taiwan and the Philippines. As aerial combat becomes increasingly fierce, it is highly appropriate to entrust important positions to aviation warfare authorities with rich frontline experience. This also reveals the Japanese Navy's determination to overcome the difficult situation. The resumes of the newly appointed generals are briefly outlined below.

Grand Admiral Toyoda: A Military and Strategic Genius

The new Chief of the Naval General Staff, Grand Admiral Soemu Toyoda, is from the same hometown as Lieutenant Commander Hiroshi Hirose, Ōita Prefecture. He graduated from the Naval Academy in 1905 and continued his studies at the Naval Gunnery School and Naval War College. During World War I, he participated in expeditions to Qingdao and Siberia. In 1924, he transitioned from ship captain to a staff member in the Naval Affairs Bureau, and in 1925, he was promoted to Captain. In 1927, he served as commander of the 7th Submarine Squadron, teaching ingenious submarine tactics. He then served as the Chief of the First Section of the Education Bureau, focusing on naval administration. In 1930, he was appointed captain of the Hyūga, and the following year, he was promoted to Rear Admiral, serving as the Chief of the Second Department of the Naval General Staff. In September 1933, he became the Chief of Staff of the Combined Fleet and the Chief of Staff of the First Fleet. In March 1935, he was transferred to the Director of the Education Bureau, and in November of the same year, he was promoted to Vice Admiral. At that time, he served as the Director of the Naval Affairs Bureau under Naval Minister Mineo Ōsumi and Vice Minister Isoroku Yamamoto, skillfully managing internal and external crises during the February 26 Incident and the Sino-Japanese War, which was highly praised at the time.

On December 10th, he was appointed as the Supreme Commander of the North China Naval Area, landing in Qingdao without bloodshed. Later, he established great military achievements during the landing in Hangzhou Bay. In November 1938, he returned to Japan and immediately assumed the position of Commander of the Second Fleet. In October of the following year, he returned to serve as the head of the Navy Technical Department. In September 1941, he was honorably promoted to Grand Admiral and appointed as the Commander of the Kure Naval District. During his two years in office, he dedicated himself to realizing independent military equipment plans, achieving significant results. In November 1942, he was appointed as a Military Councilor. In May of the following year, he was appointed as the Commander of the Yokosuka Naval District. Last March, he succeeded Fleet Admiral Mineichi Koga as the Commander-in-Chief of the Combined Fleet. This April, the Naval General Headquarters was established, and he was appointed as the Commander-in-Chief of the Navy, Commander-in-Chief of the Combined Fleet, and Commander of the Maritime Escort Fleet, a position he held until recently.

Grand Admiral Oikawa: One of the Navy's Elder Statesmen

Grand Admiral Oikawa is from Okayama Prefecture. He graduated from the Naval Academy in December 1903 and steadily rose to the rank of Grand Admiral in 1939. During this time, he held important positions such as Chief of Staff of the Kure Naval District, Chief of the First Department of the Naval General Staff, Commander of the First Air Fleet, and Principal of the Naval Academy. In November 1935, he was appointed as the Commander of the Third Fleet. In December of the following year, he was transferred to the head of the Naval Aviation Department. Since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, he has been the overall commander of the naval air force, diligently planning and working hard. In April 1938, he succeeded Admiral Hasegawa as the Commander of the China Area Fleet. In May 1940, he was appointed as the Commander of Yokosuka Naval District. In September of the same year, he became the Naval Minister in the Second Konoe Cabinet. In October of the following year, he was honorably transferred to the position of Military Councilor. In April 1942, he served as the chairman of the temporary grand festival of the Yasukuni Shrine. In November 1943, he assumed the position of the first Commander of the Maritime Escort Fleet. Last August, he succeeded Grand Admiral Shigetaro Shimada as the Chief of the Naval General Staff, a position he held until recently. Grand Admiral Oikawa assumed the position of Chief of the Naval General Staff amidst the major strategic situation following the loss of Saipan. During this period, he was able to exert his command effectively against the enemy's fierce counterattacks, inflicting significant damage and achieving great success.

Vice Admiral Ozawa: A Famous Fleet Carrier Admiral

Since the beginning of the Greater East Asia War, air power has become the main force in decisive battles. In three-dimensional naval warfare, the main force of the Navy is the mobile fleet based on aircraft carriers, and the "aircraft carrier" in coordination with base air power. Vice Admiral Ozawa is highly regarded for his command of this new aircraft carrier fleet. It can be said that no one in the Japanese Navy surpasses him. Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War until he was transferred to the position of Vice Chief of the Naval General Staff last November, Vice Admiral Ozawa has been commanding warships on the frontline, worthy of being a famous general who has experienced many battles. Among the many talented Japanese naval officers, he has long been praised as a capable talent and is highly respected. Looking back at his career since graduating from the Naval Academy, it can be seen that he has either served as a commander on the frontline or held important positions in the center of operations.

Vice Admiral Ozawa is from Miyazaki Prefecture. He graduated from the Naval Academy in 1909, along with Grand Admiral Shigeyoshi Inoue and Vice Admirals Teruhisa Komatsu, Kakuji Kakuta, and Denji Ōkawachi. In 1921, he was promoted to Lieutenant Commander and served as a staff officer in the First Torpedo Squadron. In 1929, he was appointed to the Naval General Staff. The following year, he was sent to Europe and America. Soon after, he was promoted to Captain and appointed as a destroyer squadron commander. In 1931, he served as an instructor at the Naval War College. He then served as an instructor at the Army War College (1932), captain of the Maya (1934), captain of the Haruna (1935), director of the Naval War College (1936, and promoted to Rear Admiral in the same year), Chief of Staff of the Combined Fleet and Chief of Staff of the First Fleet, and squadron commander (1937). In 1938, he was appointed as the principal of the Naval Torpedo School. Later, he returned to serve as a squadron commander, and in 1940, he was promoted to Vice Admiral. In September of the following year, he was honorably appointed as the president of the Naval War College. Since the start of the Greater East Asia War in January 1942, he has been active on the frontline, establishing immortal achievements in numerous naval battles. After the naval air battle off the Philippines last November, he was transferred back to the center and appointed as the Vice Chief of the Naval General Staff, a position he held until recently.

Vice Admiral Ōnishi: Nurturer of the Kamikaze Warriors

Vice Admiral Ōnishi, following the late Fleet Admiral Yamamoto, who nurtured the Japanese naval air power, has commanded air operations and achieved many outstanding accomplishments. Moreover, he is also the great "nurturer" of the Kamikaze Special Attack Corps warriors.

"Instead of being involved in personnel matters, I would rather serve on the battlefield." Vice Admiral Ōnishi once said earnestly. Therefore, in October of last year, when the aerial battle off Taiwan was in full swing, he was finally transferred abroad from the Director General of the Aeronautical Weapons Bureau of the Ministry of Munitions and honorably appointed as the Supreme Commander of the Naval Air Units in the Philippines. Since then, the naval battle off the Philippines and the Battle of Leyte Gulf have successively unfolded, and Vice Admiral Ōnishi has resolutely led the Kamikaze Special Attack Corps in the fierce air battles with the Americans, standing at the forefront and fighting bravely. It can be said that the Vice Admiral's achievements have created a new era in the history of Japanese aviation.

Vice Admiral Ōnishi is from Hyogo Prefecture. He graduated from the Naval Academy in 1911. In 1924, he was promoted to Lieutenant Commander. A year later, he was appointed as the flight commander of the Sasebo Naval Air Group. In 1928, he was appointed as the flight commander of the Ryūjō. In 1929, he was transferred to the Aviation Department of the Aviation Headquarters and promoted to Commander. In 1931, he was appointed as a staff member of the Education Bureau. In 1932, he was transferred to the Third Fleet as a staff officer. In 1933, he was appointed as the commander of the Sasebo Air Group and promoted to Captain. In 1934, he was appointed as the vice-commander and director of education of the Yokosuka Air Group. In 1936, he was appointed as the Director of the Education Department of the Aviation Headquarters. After 1939, he was promoted to Rear Admiral and successively served as commander of the air group and chief of staff of the fleet. In 1942, he was transferred to the Director General of the Aviation Headquarters. In May 1943, he was promoted to Vice Admiral. In November, he was appointed as the Director General of the Aeronautical Weapons Bureau of the Ministry of Munitions. Until October of last year, he took office as the Commander of the Naval Air Units in the Philippines until his recent appointment as Vice Chief of the Naval General Staff.

Looking at his experience, it can be seen that since 1915, his duties have always been related to aviation, and he has devoted himself to educating the brave soldiers of the Japanese naval air force. Today, the Japanese Navy is renewing its old outlook, putting all its efforts into completing a strong aviation fleet. At this time, bringing back Vice Admiral Ōnishi, a brave general with rich practical combat experience, to the center to take on important positions in the Naval General Staff will definitely adapt to the increasingly fierce situation of aerial decisive battles and further solidify the Japanese army like a rock.

### Tentative Suggestions for Building a Common People's Village

— Ma Huinong

In late October of the 31st year, the fire in the Jinjia Lane shantytown destroyed over 400 homes, resulting in over 2,400 deaths. On May 11th of this year, the fire in the Yuyao Road shantytown destroyed over 3,000 homes, extending to over ten factories and two alleyways, resulting in over 4,000 deaths. Looking at the damage from these two fires, the loss of both material resources and human lives, especially in these times of difficulty, not only drains the nation's strength but also brings unimaginable suffering to the livelihoods of the common people. The reasons for these two fires include the simple construction of the shantytowns, the lack of fire-fighting equipment and organizations, and society's neglect of the poor in the shantytowns. If caution is not exercised, it is difficult to extinguish the flames when they rage. The Jinjia Lane disaster area has already had a common people's village built by Buddhist organizations. The Yuyao Road disaster area is also actively being built by the same organizations. However, considering the painful lessons of the great fires, we should not only blame the past but also guard against future dangers. Now that the Yuyao Road common people's village is just starting construction, I would like to offer my humble opinions for the reference of the Municipal Government and those who are passionate about public welfare.

The number of common people in this city is very large, and the number of impoverished shantytown dwellers in areas such as Caojiadu, Xujiahui, Hongkou, Zhabei, and the South City is also significant. These impoverished shantytown dwellers make a living through manual labor, rickshaw pulling, and petty vending. They bear the most arduous production work, and they contribute a lot to the construction and prosperity of the city. Although their lives are like those of cattle and horses, they are the core strength of the city. They are the city's heroes. Before the war, the municipal authorities had improved the housing of these shantytown dwellers and built hundreds of common people's village houses on Zhongshan Road and elsewhere. However, due to the large number of common people—or impoverished people—these were not universally accessible, so shantytowns are still visible everywhere. Although the Yuyao Road common people's village is already under construction, for the sake of their lives and happiness, we should not simply provide indirect relief or change their housing situation and leave it at that. In addition to the problem of housing, education, culture, cleanliness, hygiene, medicine, fire protection, entertainment, etc., should all be given appropriate improvements.

Education: Most of the poor people and children in the shantytowns are illiterate. For the sake of national revival and the popularization of education, I hope that those who are enthusiastic about compulsory education will establish compulsory primary schools and literacy education in that area so that the poor children there can all have the opportunity to become literate. As for the teaching time, it can be arranged during their spare time.

Culture: The population in that area is large, so we should not only instill considerable knowledge but also establish a public reading room and a library. At the same time, enthusiastic people can regularly hold popular knowledge lectures in that area, such as on medicine, hygiene, and public security, all of which can enable them to make progress.

Cleanliness and hygiene: The poor do not pay attention to cleanliness and hygiene, such as dumping garbage, defecating everywhere, blocking ditches, and cluttering their rooms with dirt. As a result, mosquitoes and flies breed. Regarding this, I hope that the authorities will set up more garbage bins and public toilets, and also conduct guidance on cleanliness and hygiene, so that the poor pay attention to public health. When necessary, cleanliness inspections should be carried out.

Medicine: There are many poor people who get sick because they neglect hygiene or are unable to seek medical treatment after getting sick. Especially because the poor are ignorant, they either deliberately delay treatment in the hope of recovering on their own or seek divine intervention to avoid disaster. Such phenomena should be paid attention to. Therefore, I hope that the city's charitable organizations will set up more free clinics and pharmacies and common people's clinics in that area, reducing fees as much as possible so that all patients can receive treatment. The Health Bureau should regularly conduct vaccinations and smallpox vaccinations in that area to prevent them from epidemics or infections.

Public activities: In the area where the poor live, because the population is large, their life activities should also be paid attention to. For events such as weddings and funerals, they also need to set up banquets for celebrations. Especially for funerals, they need a suitable place to provide for them. Therefore, in the common people's village, in the same place as hundreds of houses, five or six houses should be set aside as public halls, specifically for their weddings and funerals. In ordinary times, these houses can be used to provide the most basic entertainment equipment such as chess or gramophones or radios so that they can get appropriate adjustments. In addition, try to make use of some open spaces to plant flowers and trees, and even build a small sports field so that they have the opportunity to exercise.

Fire protection: More wells should be dug, and able-bodied men should be trained in fire-fighting and a fire brigade should be organized. If possible, the authorities should provide some fire extinguishers and water hoses in preparation for disasters.

Regarding the above points, I hope that the authorities will select the most important ones and implement them, and truly try to improve the lives of the poor. Charitable organizations and well-known public figures can also assist the local public security agencies to benefit the poor. Finally, several houses should be set aside in this area for public use, which can be used for education, as a ceremonial hall, or even for providing medicine and treatment. On the other hand, those responsible for public security work should not only regularly pay attention to the management of the common people's village, but also provide practical guidance on their lives.

We should not simply solve their housing problem, but should think about building a perfect common people's village. (Moved to support the charity school fund)

### Strengthening Summer Health Administration

— Li Renzhong

Recently, the number of deaths among citizens has gradually increased. This is, of course, due to the summer heat and the ease with which diseases spread. If we want to ensure the health of citizens and avoid the invasion of cholera and other pathogens, we must strengthen health administration!

In recent years, health administration has mainly focused on compulsory vaccinations, with other aspects of health administration not yet addressed. Although this is due to a lack of economic resources, it seems that efforts could still be made in some areas. On the one hand, citizens are struggling to make a living and have no time to pay attention to health, which is an inevitable trend. However, during this summer season, if precautions are not taken, then once they fall ill, the cost of medicine will be difficult to bear, and the loss of life is also to be expected. I will outline the most important points below:

Water Use: Due to electricity restrictions, many citizens dig wells for drinking water to supplement the shortage. However, well water is definitely not as reliable as tap water. If a household uses contaminated clothing for washing and it contaminates the well, the speed of transmission will be rapid and will definitely lead to an epidemic. In 1942, cholera was rampant in the South City, with well water contamination being the biggest cause. Therefore, the discharge of sewage should be kept as smooth as possible. If it accumulates for a long time, it will definitely flow back into the wells, which will be even more harmful. In addition, accumulated water in air-raid shelters should also be properly disposed of.

Eliminating Filth and Garbage: The harm of garbage is well known. It harbors filth, breeds mosquitoes and flies, and is a breeding ground for pathogens. Therefore, we must do our best to remove it and prevent it from accumulating, which is extremely urgent. However, there are countless piles of garbage in the back alleys of the city, and in places like Pudong and the South City, some have accumulated for years without being cleared. It is thought that the health authorities have not had time to pay attention to this. The citizens are suffering greatly! Under the scorching sun, the stench is unbearable. When the breeze blows, it scatters everywhere. On rainy days, the filth flows everywhere with the water. This urgently needs to be improved.

Inspecting Fish, Meat, and Cold Drinks: Decayed fish and meat often contain toxins, which can cause illness. Street vendors' cold drinks should also be checked for cleanliness. If there are no covers and flies are accumulating, they should be ordered to improve.

Disinfection Should Be Added to Preventive Injections: Preventive injections are indeed a good intention and policy of the authorities. However, in some areas, injection technicians neglect the disinfection of injection equipment, and their indifferent attitude is even more appalling. As a result, those who are clean-minded regard injections as a harsh policy and avoid them in every possible way. Therefore, there are those who commit fraud with injection certificates, which is extremely detrimental to health administration!

Regarding Propaganda: Newspapers should publish special editions on disease prevention to increase citizens' knowledge of disease prevention, or post simple text and pictures to show the various harms of not paying attention to hygiene.

Strictly Punishing Those Who Violate Hygiene: For example, those who dump garbage on the streets or defecate in public places. In places like Pudong, there are even those who wash chamber pots in the river. Unless they are punished, it will not be enough to deter others from following suit.

Establishing More Epidemic Hospitals: If citizens suffer from epidemics and the poor cannot afford medical treatment, it not only endangers their lives but also poses a risk of infection. Therefore, it is essential to establish more epidemic hospitals and provide free treatment.

Suppressing Drug Prices: The authorities have repeatedly warned about suppressing drug prices, but the result is that those who speak earnestly are ignored. Ordinary citizens cannot afford to buy medicine, and merchants are unwilling to sell it without charging high profits due to the rising prices of everything. A stalemate has been formed that cannot be corrected. The health authorities should cooperate with the economic authorities to manage drugs, eliminate the black market, and take effective measures.

Although the above is old news, if we want to ensure health, the health authorities must devote themselves to these various efforts to be effective. Alas! The people are already suffering deeply, and how can they be burdened with unexpected disasters? It is hoped that the authorities will pay attention to this.

### Park Opening Hours

— Floating Cloud

These past few days, the weather has suddenly become stifling, and the heat on the thermometer rises step by step along with the price index. Under the unbearable pressure of life, people are even more tormented by the scorching summer, and truly find it hard to breathe.

In this season of sweltering heat, the only good thing for our laboring class, besides working in sweat, seems to be the parks with their deep green shade! Especially in today's world where the cost of living is extremely high, ordinary wage-earning citizens cannot even secure food and clothing, let alone have the extra energy to seek entertainment. They work hard at their respective jobs from sunrise to sunset, and in the evening, they always want to take some time off to rest well. The Bund Park is a good place in their minds, because there is natural cool breeze, verdant trees, and a green beach. Leaning on the chairs by the river for a short time, casually looking at the small boats drifting with the waves, and listening to the sound of the waves and the rustling of the trees, makes people forget all the fatigue of the day, and they cannot help but feel refreshed and gain infinite pleasure. Especially on muggy summer nights, those living in pigeon-cage-like houses find the park to be their paradise.

Since July 1st of this year, the municipal authorities, in order to seek the welfare of the public, have adjusted the opening hours of the Bund Park to be from 6:00 AM to 8:00 PM daily. The general public is delighted, but the reader believes that the above opening hours, which only last until 8:00 PM, seem too early. Most of the working class only have spare time around 7:00 PM after dinner to walk in the park to relieve their boredom. In fact, the park closes around 7:45 PM, so the only enjoyment of the citizens cannot be realized. Except for a few who turn to other aspects for entertainment, most of the depressed masses have a feeling of sighing at the closed gate. I secretly think that in this period of conserving electricity and controlling lights, the authorities have considerable reasons for limiting the opening hours of the park. However, to the extent possible, I sincerely hope that the municipal authorities can extend the opening to after 9:30 PM, so that the general public can get a little bit of the minimum life adjustment, which may also be of small benefit to the health and hygiene of the citizens!

### School Evacuation and Rescuing Out-of-School Students

— Rong

Now the summer vacation of various schools in this city is about to end, and schools at all levels have begun to enroll new students for the next semester. The remaining schools are probably also actively preparing. At a time when the current situation and price issues are very serious, the authorities of schools at all levels inevitably feel that it is difficult to cope with the various problems of the next semester's opening.

The suggestion of school evacuation has been circulating for a long time, and our newspaper's editorial has also repeatedly stated it. But so far, there has been no news of any planned implementation. This is not because the school authorities do not understand the advantages and disadvantages of evacuation, but because there are too many practical difficulties that need to be resolved first. Large and secondary schools with poor reputations are fundamentally insufficient to evacuate; otherwise, it will inevitably lead to consequences equivalent to dissolution. And schools with well-known reputations have many issues to consider if they want to evacuate: First, the number of students at the end of this semester has been considerably reduced compared to the time of enrollment. Most of these students have returned to their hometowns with their parents or evacuated to other places; therefore, most of the current old students have reasons why their parents are unable to leave Shanghai. If the parents can evacuate to the same location as their children, it must be an absolute minority. Second, the parents of wealthier students have doubts or distrust towards the security of the evacuation site. If they are still willing to send their children to school for their studies, it is feared that only a small number will do so. Conversely, if the schools where their children originally attended are evacuated, it is not difficult to find another school with slightly less ideal conditions to continue their studies. It is more convenient for children and parents to be in the same place for care, and at least they can get temporary peace of mind. Third, at a time when transportation is very difficult, if the school authorities want to move experimental instruments and application equipment to the evacuation site, it will not only cost a lot, but it will also be difficult to transport, package, and protect them along the way. Fourth, many of the current teachers in the schools also hold other jobs or teaching positions in other schools. They rely on the income from several places to maintain their family's livelihood. If they evacuate with one school, their income will inevitably decrease. Although the cost of living in the evacuation site is lower, they are still worried about the past skyrocketing prices. They may be able to cope with the situation when school starts, but the difficult situation will inevitably increase day by day. If there is a deficit, it will be even more difficult to remedy the situation due to unfamiliarity with both the people and the place.

In summary, school evacuation is best started with public schools. The reasons are very clear: First, public school tuition is lower and there are more students, and recently, there has been a trend of not being able to accommodate them all; therefore, there is no need to worry about insufficient students after evacuation. Second, public schools, whether national or municipal, can more easily obtain the assistance of local political and transportation agencies. Ensuring the security of the evacuation site to gain the trust of the general public, as well as the transportation and protection of instruments and equipment, cannot be done without the assistance of the relevant authorities. Third, public school teachers are entitled to the allocation of salary rice. After evacuation, they can entrust the government authorities in the evacuation site to allocate it on their behalf, and the teachers' lives can be more stable. Fourth, if public schools face economic problems after evacuation, they can still appeal to the Ministry of Education or the Education Bureau to plan and find solutions, such as organizing loans, as temporary relief. Once public schools are successfully evacuated, private schools can follow suit as needed.

The above is a discussion about the issue of school evacuation. However, before the population of this city is fully evacuated, in order to maintain the studies of the students staying in Shanghai, most schools are afraid that they will still start school in this city. However, due to the recent surge in special prices, all schools have the following difficulties: First, in order to take into account the livelihood of teachers and the burden of parents, it is very difficult to set the tuition standard. Second, the lives of citizens are threatened after the price increase, and the number of students dropping out of school will inevitably increase; therefore, the general schools staying in Shanghai are worried about insufficient students. Third, the soaring price of rice and the tightening of water and electricity restrictions make it impossible for schools to enroll boarding students. This point is enough to affect the studies of students from afar. Fourth, after the increase in tuition, the scholarships and grants of the schools are not enough to distribute. This point is enough to cause students from poor families to drop out of school.

The municipal authorities should make every effort to rescue the out-of-school students who are the main pillars of the future country. First, the fundamental solution is to stabilize prices and reduce the suffering of people's livelihood. Second, find ways to continue the distribution of necessities to faculty and staff. Third, set up more vocational schools. Fourth, the Education Bureau should closely supervise the progress of studies and the distribution of funds in each school, and should assist the schools in resolving obstacles in the process. If all these can be reasonably resolved, the number of out-of-school students can be reduced as much as possible.

### Map of Borneo and its Adjacent Areas

Since the enemy's combined forces launched a fierce bombardment on the Balikpapan area of Borneo on the 15th of last month, it took half a month until the 1st of this month before they forcibly landed at the Supirikrak Pier near Balikpapan. Recently, they have also attempted to establish a major bridgehead in the coastal forest areas of Miri and Tarakan in northern Borneo. After days of valiant resistance by the Japanese garrison and naval and air forces, the enemy suffered heavy losses and their offensive was thwarted, making it impossible to advance.

The brilliant sunshine shone in front of my eyes, and the ivy on the eaves was decorated with glazed green leaves. The water in the stream was soft; the gentle breeze rippled the surface, and the blue sky reflected on the water was also shattered.

Turning the corner, my footsteps hesitated at the door of an old house. I was not reminded of nostalgia here. That feeling had been deeply buried in a pile of rubble and weeds nearby.

Walking through the hall, clear footsteps echoed on the square bricks, and the sparrows in front of the eaves flew away noisily.

In the corridor, I saw an old man bathing in the bright sunshine.

"Second Uncle," I blurted out.

"It's you, I didn't expect you to come." With surprise, the vague voice came out from the gaps of his toothless mouth. I felt that the voice was still kind.

After entering the house, Second Uncle casually covered the "Human World Poetry Talk." We looked at each other in silence. He seemed to have a lot to say at heart. I felt that he was very excited.

"How many years has it been since we last met?"

"Nine years," I had calculated it long ago. "It was the year when my grandmother passed away."

"Time flies so fast."

The person standing in front of Second Uncle was not only grown up, but also tall, which surprised him. He energetically put his thin hand on my shoulder.

"Is it good for time to pass quickly, or is it good for it to pass slowly? ... How have you and your mother been these days ...? You haven't forgotten me, have you?"

"Uncle, we miss you very much."

The hypocritical words made my heart beat violently. "I can't help but comfort him." In fact, I was so busy dealing with the hardships of life, where could I spare a little bit of mind to pity others? Even if I occasionally remembered, it was only like the sunlight passing over the clouds.

Silence.

I looked at Second Uncle's appearance: a thin face, too many teeth had fallen out, so his cheeks had sunk in. His hair was half white. His eyes were already dull, but now there were a few traces of tears in his dry eye sockets, which seemed to have a little bit of light.

"Say something, Lin'er, you were so lively when you were a child."

Before I could dig out the accumulated memories, a thin woman flashed out of the house. She stepped forward very cautiously. Her dress and demeanor obviously did not belong to the younger generation, but she looked very young among the old people.

"This is my aunt."

"I haven't met my aunt yet." I bowed slightly, as if giving a salute.

My aunt was a capable person. She was good at dealing with people, and I didn't feel her affectation. Using the children's address, she called me "Brother Lin." She was busy asking me to sit down and handed me tea, and then she was busy arranging lunch herself. She asked her uncle for permission and said:

"I think we have to ask Wu Ma to buy a pound of carp."

"Lin'er," Second Uncle kindly called my name. "You think about it for me. People are still laughing at me, that I have to remarry at such an old age. Do you know my pain? ... Seven or eight children are not by my side, can they really bear to leave me? Besides, elder brother, they will have to get married in the future, can these things be taken care of by no one? ..."

A cat was sleeping on the black lacquered square table. It was dozing, as if thinking about something.

Everything was so quiet.

I suddenly remembered the relatives' comments on Second Uncle.

"... They can't control me, having children, that is also destined. ... I think I still haven't had enough of these torments."

So we talked about everything since we parted. The wandering life and the struggling of poverty, these words were endless. Old people strung them together with emotion. They had not experienced such pain and injustice in the long years.

It was almost noon. My aunt had probably arranged everything comfortably, held the child, and let him laugh, calling me "Brother Lin." The child, however, completely ignorant, burst into tears. Under the scolding of Second Uncle, who had achieved success in his career, she was busy carrying the child away. It turned out that Second Uncle was talking to me about how the harvest last year was particularly bad, the accumulated debts could not be paid off, and the tenants were withdrawing their leases. He was trapped in an unimaginable predicament. He also complained that his children did not understand him. In an excited mood, he unconsciously placed his hopes on me:

"Talking to you, I think you are still the most promising and understanding. You have to do well and not disappoint your mother and me."

A moment of sorrow swept across Second Uncle's face.

I couldn't tell him that if I really had a relationship with him, he would feel that I would never understand him.

A cool breeze blew into the courtyard. The moisture rose slowly in the sunlight, printing shadows on the windows and the roof tiles outside the windows. My heart. My heart was tinged with a heavy depression. What I saw out of the window was only a small patch of sky in the courtyard.

Second Uncle ordered the old woman, "Prepare lunch, and get some wine." Turning around, he said to me:

"Over the years, I have always been greedy for drinking. I can't care about what kind of wings are not weak, ... Lin'er, you have a drink with me today. I used to be against young people drinking. But ..."

So a picture floated leisurely in my memory: In the afternoon of summer, the heat disappeared, and I accompanied Second Uncle to drink in the clean courtyard, letting the cool evening breeze caress; occasionally looking up, there was a shadow of a bat passing over the dark sky, going to a dark corner - that kind of peaceful life.

The pigeon bells rang outside the window, and the clear sound was lingering in the depths of the blue sky.

So, I said to myself again, "Let my reverie be taken away."

### Where to Go?

— Zhiyun

Where to go after graduation? I heard that the school will also be closed;

Most businesses are speculative, hoarding, and in this time when people cannot make a living, society simply does not want graduates.

Parents may be disappointed, disappointment comes with the graduation of their children, raising children is also useless!

I have secretly peeked at my parents' haggard faces several times.

I always try to comfort them, saying that this is only a temporary phenomenon.

I have also hit walls and been ridiculed several times,

Like a speedboat that has lost its direction, spinning in a circular dead lake.

How much precious time and opportunities have been wasted, and I am still thinking: "Where to go"?

However, "graduation is unemployment" I have always denied.

Even if the surroundings are a solid black iron ring,

I will always firmly open a road that I should take!

### Chicken Childhood Magazine

— Wang Yun

Inside, that speckled chicken had been squatting for more than ten days. We were tired of sending it food, but it still didn't move. My brother crawled on the ground, grabbed its tail with his hands, opened his mouth, and looked inside to see if there were any chicks. The hen was very angry, and the feathers were even more terrifying. It tried to peck my brother's head, and my brother knocked on the edge of its nest, singing loudly:

"If you don't hand over the chicks tomorrow morning - I'll kill you!"

The hen half-raised her body to drive us away.

One morning, after school, I was playing with my classmates. My brother tripped Baldy Wu next door, and we triumphantly went home.

! The hen came out of the nest, and she happily led three chicks on their first parade in the courtyard.

Cluck! Cluck! ...

The hen's head advanced, one probe after another. The chicks followed closely behind, like three small velvet balls rolling: black, red-flowered, and white.

Cheep! Cheep! ...

"Only three chicks hatched from ten eggs!" Grandma sat on the threshold, regretting.

This gave us a lot of joyful information. Every day, we picked a handful of rice to feed them, watching the little beaks peck at the ground, thinking it was quite interesting.

The back garden was a flat green meadow, with several old willows bowing their waists and stretching their arms, with tender branches and green leaves thickly covering the sky. The old days in the sky were quiet, and the sunlight, passing through the holes, was neither cold nor warm. In the wind, it sent a burst of warmth, silence! The bird cherry trees were covered with small yellow flowers, and a group of bees hovered there, humming a little tune.

Cheep! - Cheep!

The chick snuggled against its mother, shrinking its neck, lying in the grass, scratching its beak with its claws, and quietly looking at the new world. When tired, a thin white film covered its little eyes.

Cheep! - Cheep!

The chicks grew up day by day!

One of the white chicks was missing. My brother and I were anxious to find it, but it was not there. A few days later, its body was pulled up from the well.

One windy night, the cat opened the chicken coop and snatched one away.

"Don't cry! We'll hatch more in the future." My father always comforted us wisely.

Suffering from chicken plague, the hen coughed for two days, and then died silently.

"It's missing its child!" My brother sadly thought of me, and I immediately felt that I was really sorry for the hen!

Only one was left! It walked around alone every day, stopping from time to time, tilting its head and listening, listening, ...

"Where is my mother? Where are my brothers?"

Cheep! - Cheep!

Wandering, calling out in disappointment.

One autumn evening, it was gone again! I had to search every corner of the house and woodpile. Nothing! Going to the back garden, my brother smacked his lips and called:

"Cluck! Cluck!"

No response. The rain was hitting the leaves, rustling.

Looking at a clump of long grass for a long time, I heard a faint cry, I climbed in and pulled it out, and my brother took a breath.

"Raising chickens that don't lay eggs, what are they for!" The little chicken's head began to grow a crown, and my grandma pouted.

But we secretly fed it handfuls of rice.

The crown grew higher, blood red.

Cluck! Cluck! -

I was buttoning my jacket: "Listen, the chick is crowing!"

My brother laughed happily.

The winter night was cold, and the moonlight cast the shadow of the west house into the courtyard, clearly dividing it into two halves. A star jumped on the crescent moon, a red eye.

Cluck, cluck - cluck! The chicken was crowing.

"Get up later! Isn't it hard?" My mother loved us.

But my brother happily said, "No! We sleep with our chicken and get up with it!"

It had really grown up too. Once, it pecked the head of the white chicken of the Da Wa family, causing it to bleed. Later, when it saw it, it ran away for its life. It followed the sugar seller's stick dancing, and the old man couldn't hit it no matter what. If people who came to my house offended it, they would get pecked. For this reason, the old woman next door cursed it every day: a vicious chicken!

"Kill it and sacrifice it during the New Year. Such a fierce chicken!" Grandma said.

"Try killing it!" My brother was unconvinced.

My mother sympathized with us and said, "It's better to be fierce! The old woman next door comes over every day, babbling about winter melons and red dates. At the end, she still asks your grandmother for something before she leaves. Here, she's coming again!"

When spring came, the rooster grew even taller, standing on one leg on the wall, and the breeze blew up the red-brown tail feathers. He cocked his head and crowed twice, full of vigor.

Cluck - cluck! Cluck - cluck!

Grandma walked over, followed by a burly man with a net in his hand.

I screamed in fear. I hurriedly waved my hands to drive it away:

"Go away!"

The man hurried up and slammed a net down.

Flapping, flapping, ...

It tilted its body, oh, it finally escaped! It flapped its wings and flew out the door.

The man followed closely, and I cried! I ran around shouting, and it flew to the roof of the old woman next door again.

Cluck-cluck! Cluck-cluck!

The rooster didn't crow often, but it was being chased like this, and I felt greatly insulted, and angrily cursed the man.

The man didn't look at me, he wiped the sweat from his head with his hands in a ruthless manner.

The old woman next door drove it down from the roof, and it flew in the air.

The man's net fell down!

Squawk! Squawk! ...

Struggling; then it was trapped in the net again. Struggling; the man pinched its neck with one hand and stuffed it into his chicken coop in a confused manner.

I cried in disappointment, ...

"Don't cry, all this money is for you"! Grandma put the silver coins in both hands in front of me.

I slapped it away, and the silver coins scattered all over the ground, rolling around.

"You have been wronged, child!"

Mother walked over with wet hands, took me away, I cried, and mother also shed tears.

When my brother found out, he lowered his head to find Grandma, but my mother grabbed him, and he cried angrily.

From then on, we lost that crowing rooster! ...

### Sino-Japanese Softball Game: Panda Team Unluckily Loses to Japanese Residents

— (Bin)

Five to Six… A Difference of One Point

Baseball has become less popular in our country in recent years. As a long-time baseball fan, I learned from the newspaper about the public softball league in Shanghai, with our Chinese Panda team participating. So, on the fourth, I drove to watch the game. It was the Panda team versus the Japanese Residents team. Regarding the skills of these two teams and the game's progress, I offer my humble criticism below.

In this game, the Chinese team lost to the Japanese Residents team by a score of six to five, a difference of one point. Japanese citizens have always emphasized baseball, regarding it as one of their national sports. The Chinese team's defeat in this match was not without reason. In my opinion, the Chinese team lost due to a lack of composure. Additionally, their offense seemed too weak. Conversely, the Japanese team's players seemed slightly more experienced. Furthermore, their hitting was excellent, especially the shortstop Su Ruo and the catcher Miura. It was said that two key players from the Chinese team, Wang Qingrui and Wen Ruixiong, mistakenly missed the game. Catcher Wang Xiushan and coach Liang Fuchu stepped in, but it was to no avail. However, Mr. Liang is still a veteran. Despite his age, he remains agile, making several brilliant catches at first base. As for catcher Wang, his ball handling seemed rusty, likely due to a lack of practice.

Japanese Team's Hitting is Excellent, Chinese Team Lacks Composure

The game was quite tense. In the first two innings, the Chinese team lost two points due to misfields between second and third base. However, in my observation, these two points were lost due to the Japanese team's excellent hitting. For example, the first point was lost when Japanese player Inoshita hit a low, fast ball along the third base line, which was difficult to catch. Also, in the second inning, Su Ruo hit a parallel, fast ball that barely cleared the head. In baseball, these two types of hits almost always guarantee a safe hit, so it's no wonder the Panda team was helpless against them. However, what I want to comment on in this game is the Chinese team's lack of composure and uncharacteristic mistakes. For example, in the fifth inning, center fielder Wang Nianzi dropped a high fly ball hit by Ueshima, which allowed Miura to score and Ueshima to get a double. In the same inning, catcher Wang Xiushan mistakenly believed the Japanese team had two outs. When Iwatate stole second base, he hastily threw to second baseman Wen Tianhua, allowing Ueshima, who was at third, to advance home. Whether Wang's throw was due to a misunderstanding is unknown. Perhaps Wang had devised a clever plan to lure Ueshima off base, with Wen Tianhua then throwing home for the catcher to make the play. But regardless, Wang's throw was due to a lack of composure and caution.

With Careful Offense, Victory Could Be Turned Around

As for the Panda team's hitting, I have not attended their previous games. But in this game, I felt that the players' hitting skills were not yet perfect. In the fourth inning, coach Liang Fuchu hit a brilliant shot, allowing Zhong Baoluo and Li Qizheng, who were on second and third base, to score. Mr. Liang is, after all, a baseball veteran. If it weren't for his hit, those two points probably wouldn't have been scored. Most unfortunately, in the last inning, if the Chinese team's players had been more composed and hit aggressively, they still had a chance of winning. At this time, they were only behind by one point, and they had two runners on second and third. All they needed was a hit to tie the game or even turn the defeat into victory. Unfortunately, Liang Youwen and Liang Youyi both used short swings, and their high fly balls were easily caught by catcher Miura, thus sealing the defeat.

Describing the Japanese Team's Excellence for the Chinese Team's Reference

Finally, based on my personal observations, I will briefly describe the strengths and weaknesses of the Japanese Residents team for the Panda team's reference when they play again in the second round. I carefully observed the batting order of the Japanese Residents team, placing good hitters first, such as Nogami, Inoshita, Iwahana, Su Ruo, Miura, etc., with the weaker hitters batting last. Therefore, the Japanese team's chances of winning are usually in the first three or four innings. If the Chinese team can defend carefully during these innings and prevent these players from getting on base and scoring, it is doubtful whether the Japanese team can win later. As for the Japanese Residents' defense, the area between second and third base is their best. Their outfielders are mediocre and appear flustered when catching the ball. Catcher Miura's throws are very fast, so stealing should not be attempted lightly. As for pitcher Ueshima, he has a rather impatient temper. If he loses several points in a row, he will become flustered and throw wild pitches. However, his left arm is very powerful, so be careful when catching his high fly balls.

Panda Team to Play Portuguese Merchants Tomorrow

I heard that tomorrow (the 8th) at 10:30 AM, the Chinese Panda team will play the Portuguese Merchants at the Russian Athletic Association field on Avenue Joffre (Nanjing West Road) and Rue Cardinal Mercier (Maoming Road). The Portuguese team was last year's league champion, and players like "Home Run" specialists Tangbala, Mashaner, Oliveira, etc., are all top players. Whether the Chinese team can win the championship in the league will depend on their victory over the Portuguese Merchants. Also, on the 12th (Thursday) at 4:30 PM, the Panda team will play the Pirates. Although the Pirates' skills are mediocre, the Chinese team should not be overconfident to avoid an upset.

### Charity Tennis Tournament by China Real Estate Association to be Held Next Weekend

The China Real Estate Association's charity tennis tournament was previously reported. According to this week's information, the association has been actively preparing for the event, and the date has been set for next weekend. To make the event more grand, Mr. Lin Kanghou has been invited to officiate the opening ceremony, and female stars will be invited to present the awards. The grandeur of the occasion is certainly to be expected. Amid the cold atmosphere of tennis this summer, this is naturally a tennis match that is particularly appealing.

I spoke with Mr. Ma Runfang, the person in charge of the association. All expenses for the charity tournament will be borne by the association, and all proceeds from ticket sales will be donated to the scholarship funds of Shen Bao and Sin Wan Bao newspapers. The association's goal is to promote tennis and help underprivileged students through this opportunity.

This competition should be considered the only tennis match this year. For tennis fans, it is the only opportunity to enjoy tennis. I sincerely hope you don't miss this chance. Ticket prices are divided into two types: 50,000 yuan (honor tickets) and 20,000 yuan (regular tickets). The honor tickets have already been entrusted to various parties for sale and are sold out.

The participating players and their order are currently being arranged by the authorities. As far as I know, Wang Wenzheng, Tao Guanqiu, Zhang Dingjian, Zhou Guanjun, Li Leishi, etc., will all be playing. In fact, are there any other stars on the Shanghai tennis scene besides these? The most anticipated match is, of course, Wang Wenzheng versus Tao Guanqiu. They have never officially faced each other before. This time, it is internally decided that the two must compete for the upper hand. This is truly a feast for our eyes. Who wouldn't want to see this exciting singles match to determine the champion?

The association will host a reception for the sports and news media at 3:00 PM today. They will give us the greatest introduction and explanation at this tea party.

### Yang's Basketball Invitational Tournament Enlivens Summer Scenery

— Jie

Mr. Yang Shu-ting, the general manager of Wing On Bank, has always been a promoter of basketball. Recently, Mr. Yang, in view of the lack of basketball courts in Shanghai, which has made the sport less popular than before, has held an invitational tournament, inviting six strong Shanghai basketball teams to compete at the Yang family basketball court on Dahua Road. Although basketball is not a summer sport, it is a good opportunity to stretch one's muscles and bones. In other words, it is a good opportunity to enliven the summer scenery, which is worth mentioning. According to reporters, Mr. Yang is holding this invitational tournament to focus on interest and improving the level of play. Therefore, the competition will not have a championship trophy. In the future, after a championship team is selected from the six teams, the other five teams will host a banquet for the championship team for the purpose of socializing. The so-called six strong teams are introduced below:

Ren Yu Team

The Ren Yu team has a long history in Shanghai. It was previously managed by Mr. Tan Xingbo. I understand that Mr. Tan has left Shanghai. However, before leaving, Mr. Tan entrusted Mr. Chen Wei-yuan to take over. Mr. Chen, under great trust, has invited Mr. Hu Ganbo as the team leader, Yan Yicheng as the manager, Wang Bingnan as the coach, and veteran Yu Yuzhi as the captain. Players include Li Luohe, Lin Weiting, Chen Weiyuan, Wang Huaishu, Yao Wenyi, He Wende, Shen Juming, Wang Chuqing, etc. Lin Huicong's return to his former team and the addition of new player He Lide have strengthened the team's strength. In terms of level of play, the team is determined to improve.

Red Team

The Red team is mostly the elite of the Yang's team. Players such as Lu Zhong'en, Xu Wenkui, and Yang Yuanlong have long been known. The team often practices at the court, so their home-field advantage is self-evident. We should wait and see their special achievements.

Blue Team

The Blue team is the second team of the Yang's team. Strong players such as Wei Dangsun are also good players in the basketball world. In addition, with the Yang's team's guidance, the young team is sure to put on an outstanding show.

Hua Nan

The Liu family generals of Hua Nan once caused a sensation. Then, due to the dispersion of its strong players, it disbanded virtually. Commentators have expressed endless regret for this promising new army. With He Jingui's return to Shanghai and Li Ruixiong's return again, the Hua Nan team will be in the hands of Liu family generals, and it should not lose its past glory.

Zhen Yuan

Although the Zhen Yuan team is the leader of the second teams, their skills have improved day by day under the guidance of Shanghai racecourse horse trainer Ma Xizhi, which is impressive. In addition, with Tian Lie's command, they complement each other. Therefore, in this invitational tournament, there will be a wild-card team, and the team itself will not underestimate its worth.

You Lu

The You Lu team is the overall champion of the second team basketball league this year, and its performance is naturally outstanding. The team's coach is former Shanghai Western team giant Kajie Mi Luofu. Mr. Kajie is not only intelligent and resourceful, but also has skills above the average level. This time, in order to raise the You Lu team to the first rank, he will personally assist the team. With Mr. Kajie's skills and the young players’ joint performance, its sophistication is far beyond our expectations.

In summary, Mr. Yang Shu-ting is holding this invitational tournament because the six teams are the most balanced in terms of interest and strength, which is expected to yield unexpected results. Basketball fans will flock to Dahua Road at that time. And it will be the basis for raising the level of play in the next tournament, without a doubt.

### Talking About Badminton (3)

— Lian

Digestive Organs

In his book "Family Medicine," Zi Sheng-bai said, "All people should exercise. If they do not exercise, their muscles and blood circulation will be hindered, their stomach will become unhealthy, and various digestive diseases will arise. Therefore, exercise and digestion are mutually complementary." This kind of badminton exercise is very beneficial for the digestive system. For example, saving a low ball in front requires bending the body forward, putting pressure on the abdomen. When hitting a high ball coming from behind, the upper body leans back as much as possible. The abdominal muscles stretch, affecting the stomach and intestines, causing them to undergo rapid exercise, which strengthens the stomach and intestines. With good digestion, diseases such as chronic gastritis and chronic stomach problems will not occur. Many women in our country suffer from stomach problems, so they should do badminton exercise urgently.

Mental and Cheerful

When exercising various ball sports, one can forget all worries, sorrows, and pain, leaving not a trace in the mind. However, if one has deep troubles and goes to do slow games, the troubles will still linger in the mind, unable to be eliminated. Only by playing fast and urgent ball games can one forget everything. Because the brain nerves have to deal with the oncoming ball quickly, they cannot think about troubles.

The Origin of Badminton

Badminton is a very interesting game, a very beneficial game, and a very easy to learn game. This game does not require years of practice like tennis, yet it has the same benefits and the same interest. Therefore, no one dislikes this sport.

Badminton is a common saying in India. This sport originated in places such as Kolkata and Mantell in India. Taking a shuttlecock-like ball and using two wooden boards, people would play this game in any open space or at home. At first, the people who played were probably children. Later, the British saw that this game had a lot of value, so they improved the shuttlecock-like ball. The center of gravity and the weight of the ball were scientifically studied, and it became the badminton ball commonly used today. In fact, because this ball is a competitive game, the purpose is to shoot at each other. The ball is hit back and forth. The distinction between victory and defeat is also for this ball. Therefore, the English call this ball Shutretock. The British in London and Americans who love sports followed suit. The French also liked new sports. So the game of badminton became popular all over the world.

Badminton Construction

Badminton is divided into two parts: the ball and the feather. The ball is made of softwood into a semi-circular ball shape, called the ball surface. The diameter of the ball surface is one inch, connecting to a one and a quarter inch long cylindrical shape, called the ball body. The ball surface is covered with fine wool. White feathers are inserted on the ball body. The weight of the ball surface and the ball body is about nine cents. Too light is not suitable. Too heavy, the ball comes very fast, and is not suitable for beginners, and it is also expensive.

The feather part uses light white chicken feathers or white pigeon feathers. The length of the feathers is two and a half inches, the feather stem is one inch, and the feather is one and a half inches. The feather stem is inserted into the ball body about half an inch. The tip of the feather should be trimmed. The feather should be immersed in glue and glued. The feather stem is bound with thread. The weight of the feather is about five cents.

The weight of the entire badminton ball is 73 grams to 85 grams. It is about one coin and four points. The most suitable. The newly released rubber ball body is not suitable for beginners because the ball flies very fast.

Badminton Court

Although the form of the badminton court is similar to that of the tennis court, they are actually very different. The size of the tennis court is fixed and cannot be changed. Too large or too small is illegal. However, the badminton court can be adapted to local conditions and can be stretched or shrunk in size. This is the convenience of badminton. However, the form of marking the boundary line is slightly more complicated than the boundary line of the tennis court. The most common court is 44 feet long and 20 feet wide.

Net

The net should be made of fine and strong thread, woven into a one-inch square mesh, so that the badminton ball cannot pass through the mesh. The net is about three feet high, and the net is about 22 feet long, with a maximum of 25 feet. Unlike the tennis net, which is cut close to the ground, the badminton net should be placed high on two posts, five feet from the ground vertically downwards from the top edge. It should not be too high or too low.

Net Posts

Use a 3-inch diameter round solid wood post, insert it into the ground, about two or three feet or more. The total length of the post is about 6 feet.

The posts are divided into two types: fixed and movable. The movable posts should use iron tips to make the post feet and insert them deeply into the mud. Fixed posts should be buried in the mud to ensure stability. However, the net posts should not be too far from the side line to avoid misunderstandings when playing.

Racket

The racket was originally called Battledore and is commonly called Bahninton Tacket badminton racket, because the indigenous people of India used two wooden boards to play. The author personally saw it once in India in 1925. Now the racket is made of strings, similar to a tennis racket. However, the badminton racket is very thin and light, and is not as heavy as a tennis racket.
