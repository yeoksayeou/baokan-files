### Political Equality and Economic Mutual Benefit: Japan Insists on its Policy Towards China; Resident Ambassadors to China Held a Meeting in Tokyo Yesterday

Tokyo, 21st (Central News Agency) - Mr. Togo, the Greater East Asia Minister of Japan, held a Continental Liaison Conference on the 19th and 20th. Considering the development of the situation and in order to consult with the resident ambassadors in China on the operation of the China policy, he held a meeting of the heads of the Japanese embassies and consulates in China at the official residence of the Greater East Asia Ministry on the 21st. Those present included Ambassador Gu to China, Ministers Kusonoto, Tsuchida, and Hachiri, and other relevant officials stationed abroad. From the Greater East Asia Ministry, there were Greater East Asia Minister Togo, Vice Minister Tajiri, and others. They discussed Japan's insistence on its policy towards China and resolved to strengthen its implementation.

Minister of Greater East Asia Togo's Address

Greater East Asia Minister Togo delivered an impromptu address, stating in essence that the basis of Japan's diplomatic policy towards China is to seek equality in the political sphere and mutual benefit in the economic sphere. This policy will never change. With the progress of the situation, the importance of the China issue to Japan is expanding. In addition to assisting China's unification and achieving its autonomy and independence, Japan seeks equality in the political sphere and mutual benefit in the economic sphere to establish friendly relations between China and Japan. This is the fundamental policy that Japan adheres to. Therefore, Japan must overcome all obstacles and strive to realize its fundamental policy, as this is closely related to Japan's overcoming of the current difficulties.

### Japan's Kamikaze Corps and Air Force Continue to Vigorously Attack Enemy Ships; The Battle on Land in Okinawa Becomes Increasingly Fierce

Tokyo, 21st (Central News Agency) - There is little doubt that both Japan and the United States now regard the Battle of Okinawa as the decisive battleground of the Greater East Asia War. Although the enemy has suffered extremely heavy losses since landing on the main island of Okinawa, it is still using all its strength to continuously reinforce the Okinawa battlefield, and the number of troops is increasing. Around the 17th, the number of enemy special aircraft carriers near Okinawa Island increased sharply, and the number of transport ships also increased significantly. The number of aircraft attacking the archipelago once decreased to 200 per day, but on the 17th and 18th, it increased again to more than 300. The Japanese military's Kamikaze Special Attack Corps and various air force units continue to launch fierce attacks. The situation in the Battle of Okinawa is of great importance, and we cannot afford to be negligent for a moment. In particular, the land battle is becoming increasingly fierce, and the future is not optimistic. Victory in the land battle is a prerequisite for the sea battle. Therefore, without the continued development of this land battle, the results of the special attack corps would not be so brilliant. The reasons are as follows:

When the enemy's fleet and mobile units are active, the Japanese special attack corps can exert its greatest ability. If the land battle ends, the enemy's supplies to the ground will also decrease, and they will no longer gather a large number of ships around them. If the land base is less active, the enemy's mobile units' activity in that direction will likely decrease, and the Japanese military will not be able to fully exert its power in attacking them. If the enemy can expand the land base to a certain extent, then Kyushu, Shikoku, and the vicinity of Korea will also be included in the combat aircraft patrol range. If this is the case, the activity of Japanese aircraft will be considerably delayed, and the danger of transporting supplies to the mainland will also increase. In this situation, the enemy will have time to prepare for the next operation. From the above points, it can be seen that in order for Japan to achieve victory and for the special attack corps to fully exert its power, the army and navy on Okinawa Island must cooperate. Therefore, the Japanese land forces are overcoming all difficulties to thoroughly counterattack the enemy's heavy pressure.

### The Japanese Zamu Detachment Employs Ingenious Tactics

Southern Base, 21st (Central News Agency) - The battle on the Tarakan front is becoming increasingly fierce. The Japanese army is defeating the enemy everywhere. The valiant fighting of the Zamu detachment of the Japanese marines is particularly noteworthy. The detachment learned that the enemy troops had landed on the east coast of Tarakan Island on both sides of the Yama, and launched a surprise attack, inflicting heavy damage. In particular, the battle on the 12th and 13th annihilated an entire enemy company moving in front of the detachment. This battle yielded many spoils of war, including rifles and hand grenades. During this time, the enemy attempted to cut off the detachment's retreat, but the detachment used ingenious tactics to crush the enemy's attempt. Their swift and decisive actions were highly praised by the entire army.

### Fierce Battle in Davao

Philippines, 21st (Central News Agency) - Since the 16th, the enemy troops in the Davao area have focused their attacks on the right bank of the Davao River. Under the cover of intense artillery fire, they launched several tanks to attack. The battle in this area has gradually become fierce. Six transport ships in the north arrived at Davao Bay on the 16th, seemingly to land reinforcements. In the three days from May 14th to 16th, the Japanese troops in this area killed or wounded about 200 enemy soldiers, shot down five enemy planes, destroyed three tanks, one armored vehicle, and one cannon. Also, at noon on the 17th, about 400 enemy soldiers and two tanks invaded a point seven kilometers east of Davao. Japanese troops in that area are currently engaged in combat with them.

### Zhejiang Province Plans to Dredge Rivers

Hangzhou, 21st (Central News Agency) - The Zhejiang Provincial Agricultural Promotion Association, based on the benefits of the Shangtang River dredging plan prepared by Hang County last year, which benefited an area of more than 20,000 mu, plans to dredge the Xiang River in Wenjia Weir, Xiaoshan, this year and build various dams to facilitate irrigation. This is the largest water source in eastern Zhejiang, with many tributaries, comparable to the water conservancy of West Lake. The expenses will be decided after the detailed engineering plan is prepared.

Trying to Plant Superior Varieties of Crops

Also, the association plans to collect various superior varieties that have already been developed from the Central Agricultural Experiment Institute and demonstration farms of cooperatives in various places in the province this year, and conduct comparative trials in local areas. The materials for the trials will be mainly rice for summer crops and wheat for winter crops. Other miscellaneous grains and special agricultural products will be considered and tested according to the different local conditions. After successful results are achieved, they will be propagated on a large scale and promoted in rural areas to increase production. As for the funding, it will be used from the business expenses approved by the provincial experimental agencies and demonstration farms of various cooperatives.

### Japanese Troops Valiantly Fighting at Each Stronghold on the East Coast; American Military Sacrifice Exceeds 20,000

Southern Front Base, 21st (Central News Agency) - Fierce battles continued on the front line of Okinawa Island on the 18th and 19th. The Japanese garrison is still bravely fighting in the positions of each stronghold on the east coast, including Heights 606, 150, and 51. It has been ten days since the enemy launched a general offensive against the main Japanese positions with all its forces on the 9th. The enemy, day and night, is relentlessly advancing with huge amounts of material and superior forces at the cost of sacrifice. The soldiers on the front line are also inflicting heavy damage on them at any time. The enemy's sacrifices have exceeded 20,000. The current battle line is only 200 to 2,000 meters away from the Xiexi Yuan Highland, Maeda Southern Marsh, and Anxie connected line at the time of the 9th. The bravery of the Japanese soldiers is truly astonishing. The enemy's positions have recently shown signs of fatigue. The enemy's strong attack on the Amanetai area north of Naha has been repeatedly fought fiercely in recent days. The Japanese troops stationed there are defending the area under the skillful cover of the rear artillery positions. Since the 18th, the enemy's attacks in this area have stalled, but the enemy, with its large number of troops, will certainly launch a new offensive against this area. The movements of enemy ships attempting to land on the flanks and backs of the main Japanese positions cannot be taken lightly.

Lisbon, 21st (Central News Agency) - The American troops broke into the Japanese army's positions connecting Naha, Shuri, and Nahara, aiming to capture the important highlands dominating the three cities. Fierce tug-of-war battles have repeatedly occurred between Japan and the United States. The four American divisions on this front line are indeed unable to cope. According to a report from the United Press in Guam, acknowledging the bitter battle in Okinawa, the battle situation on the 18th reported by the Nimitz Command is as follows: The 1st Marine Division of the United States Navy is engaged in a hard-fought battle on the Sugar Cane Highland northeast of Naha, which has reached its peak, but the southern side of the ridge is still in the hands of the Japanese army. This area is a key point for shielding the western flank of the Okinawa front. The US Navy launched nine offensives in the past week, but has not succeeded. Only the ridge area changed hands four times in a fierce battle on the 18th. The 7th Regiment of the 1st Marine Division of the United States Navy advanced about 200 meters and approached the Omyo Valley on the southern side of the Sugar Cane Highland, but as a result, it retreated from the previously occupied Omyo and Takushi positions. The 77th Division of the US Army northeast of Shuri occupied a small highland twice on the 18th, but was forced to retreat due to the fierce fire of field artillery and Japanese artillery. Also, the Japanese army is fighting fiercely with hand grenades against the American army's strongholds.

Lisbon, 21st (Central News Agency) - In the battle of Okinawa, the American troops suffered heavy losses from the Japanese military's special attack corps' fierce attacks. According to a New York dispatch from the United Press, since April 1st, the naval personnel killed in action in Okinawa alone have reached 4,000, which is clear evidence of the Japanese military's special attack corps' continuous and relentless attacks.

### The Sixth Plenary Session of the Chongqing Kuomintang Concludes, Passing Various Proposals

Lisbon, 21st (Central English Agency) - According to a telegram from Chongqing: The Sixth Plenary Session decided on the following major issues on the 18th: Establishing a constitutional political system and improving the lives of the people. Cooperating with Britain and the United States to establish a world security guarantee mechanism. Concluding mutual assistance agreements and commercial agreements with each other. Realizing the local autonomy of the Mongolian and Tibetan nationalities. Improving the equipment and treatment of the national army and officers and soldiers. Freedom of speech, reporting, assembly, association, religion, and academic research. Realizing equality between men and women in economic, social, political, and educational fields. Aiming at eliminating illiteracy through popular education and encouraging the realization of adult education.

Lisbon, 21st (Central News Agency) - According to a telegram from Chongqing: Chiang Kai-shek, in his capacity as the President of the Kuomintang, submitted five proposals to the plenary session on the 19th, requesting their adoption: All Kuomintang branches within the Chongqing military must be cancelled within three months. No party branches should be established in schools. The Three People's Principles Youth League should serve as a youth training institution and be taken over by the government. Elections should be held in all counties and cities under the Chongqing regime within six months to organize county and city political councils. Provinces with more than half of the counties and cities having county and city political councils should immediately implement elections and establish temporary provincial political councils as representative bodies of the province to assume political affairs. Enact a law on the organization of political parties to grant legal status to political parties other than the Kuomintang. During the period of governance, the administrative agencies operated under the Kuomintang should be taken over by the government.

Central News Agency Dispatch - According to a telegram from Chongqing: The Sixth Plenary Session of the Chongqing Kuomintang has been held continuously for 20 meetings since it opened on the 5th of this month, and is scheduled to close on the 21st. The main purpose of this Sixth Plenary Session is to convene the National Congress to prepare for the implementation of constitutional government. However, in addition to determining the date of the National Congress, the most important issues of electing representatives and the draft constitution have been entrusted to the decision of the Sixth Central Executive Committee. The resolution on the Communist Party, which has attracted much attention, is truly overshadowed when compared with the active offensive of the Seventh Plenary Session held by Yan'an, which proves Chongqing's indecision on its policy towards Yan'an. Also, during the diplomatic report of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Chongqing Kuomintang, it was resolved to strengthen friendly relations with the Soviet Union. The resolution in the political report pointed out the shortcomings of Chongqing's politics, which is extremely interesting. In addition, the Chongqing Kuomintang is solely focused on preserving the power of the party after the implementation of constitutional government. The most important resolution of the Sixth Plenary Session in Chongqing is the "Various Necessary Measures to Promote the Implementation of Constitutional Government" proposed by Chiang Kai-shek and passed by the 17th session. The resolution stipulates that within the next three months, the party branches attached to the military must be abolished and the party branches in various schools must be cancelled. According to the claims of the Chongqing side, "This at least proves that the Kuomintang is working to divide the boundaries between the party and the government during the period of implementation of constitutional government to facilitate the implementation of constitutional government." On the one hand, the resolution transfers the Three People's Principles Youth League from the party to be directly under the government, defining it as an institution for training youth. This is extremely noteworthy, proving that the intention of the Chongqing side, although it has cancelled the party branches attached to the military and schools, still wants to place them under the control of the Chongqing Kuomintang.

Also, the policy program resolved by the General Assembly on the 18th is not a policy to cope with the current wartime situation, but still firmly adheres to its principle of coping with peacetime after the war, listing general strategies deduced from the principles of the Three People's Principles. This is another attempt by the Chongqing Kuomintang to use the National Assembly as an excuse to list its principled policies in order to attract the masses and counter other parties. Also, the General Assembly on the 19th resolved to increase the number of central executive and supervisory committee members to 460, so that it could obtain 240 Kuomintang-designated representatives in the National Assembly, as well as 460 central executive and supervisory committee members as ex-officio representatives, totaling 700 pure Kuomintang representatives, ensuring that about half of the 1,440 National Assembly representatives had a majority of votes, proving that the Chongqing Kuomintang was preparing to gain the power to influence the National Assembly, which has aroused criticism from all sides.

### Military Commentator Elaborates on Recent Political and War Trends: The Confrontation Between Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union Will Become More Profound

Central News Agency Dispatch - After five years of struggle, Germany unfortunately failed and surrendered to the joint forces of Britain and the United States. Thus, the European war came to an end. In order to end the war in East Asia as soon as possible, Britain and the United States have shifted the center of operations to the Pacific. For days, the American troops on Okinawa Island have suffered fierce annihilation from the Japanese army, and the damage has been severe, so they are increasingly mired in a quagmire. Due to the ineffectiveness of the American military's operations on Okinawa Island, and in order to contain the war situation, there seem to be new attempts to stir up trouble recently. The Japanese side has made full preparations and is waiting to inflict a heavy blow on the attackers. Recently, a military commentator made a detailed elaboration on the recent world political situation, the war situation, and its trends, which are recorded separately as follows:

The United States Suffers an Air Strike

Britain and the United States, after the end of the European war, shifted the center of operations to the Pacific. Looking at its main combat power: The operations towards Okinawa Island are commanded by Nimitz. The operations in Luzon Island, Mindanao, and Tarakan are led by MacArthur. The British Indian Army is moving towards Burma and in the Bay of Bengal. The United States is using the Mariana Islands as the main central base for aerial bombing. On the Okinawa Island front, Japanese special attack corps and air force units have been fiercely attacking enemy ships for days, and it is expected that the enemy will be wiped out. The area between Naha and Shuri in Okinawa Island and Yonabaru is still in fierce combat, and the situation is tragic. In particular, the combat power of the Japanese army has gradually become effective. In the past, the enemy's Fourth Army landed on Okinawa Island, believing that the resistance of the Japanese army was unexpectedly weak, but the attacks of the American troops and the current Japanese army have exceeded the intensity of Iwo Jima. According to a San Francisco dispatch on the 20th of this month, the US wartime broadcasting station broadcast that as of the 19th, the number of American soldiers killed in action was 10,000, and the number wounded was 26,000. Also, according to a Delhi dispatch on the same day, the Nimitz Command broadcast that the number of American soldiers killed in action was 8,310, and the number wounded was 22,216. It can be seen that the numbers released by the two sides of the United States are full of errors, and they also obscure the damage by reporting more deaths than injuries. They did not include the number of troops damaged at sea. In addition, an interesting issue is not the amount of casualties, but the nature of the casualties. According to the announcement of the San Francisco wartime broadcasting station on the 17th, the number of American soldiers killed in action was 3,671, and the number wounded was 15,625, totaling 19,296. According to the statistics on the 18th and 19th, the number of American soldiers killed in action was 4,639, and the number wounded was 6,591, totaling 11,230. Therefore, on average, the US military has 5,612 casualties per day, 234 casualties per hour, and 4 casualties per minute. In the past Iwo Jima, the US military casualties averaged 3 per minute, and the damage reached more than 30,000, which has caused an uproar in domestic public opinion. However, in the current Okinawa battle, the US military averages 4 casualties per minute, which is an unprecedented blow in American history.

Troop Transfer Plans are Difficult to Implement

The US military has suffered heavy casualties in the Okinawa operation. According to a San Francisco broadcast on the 20th, the US military has repeatedly occupied the hills of Naha, but as a result, the Japanese army has recaptured them. It can be seen that the American Nimitz's inter-island strategy is boasting to the world. Unfortunately, this new mobile unit's action to move north is attempting to start a new operation. At the same time, MacArthur is attempting to strengthen the bombing base in the Mariana Islands in order to open a new way out. These various manifestations show that the United States has fallen into a long-term war. The United States originally hoped for a short-term operation, and its heart is as anxious as fire. After the end of the European war, the United States is filled with a peaceful atmosphere, seeking an early end to the war, so the United States has been burying operational difficulties, and Nimitz's operational failure has been revealed. The United States originally planned to transfer European forces to the Pacific battlefield, but due to various diplomatic and military relations, it is difficult to transfer them. Under these circumstances, if the US military fails in Okinawa, its operational prospects will undoubtedly be difficult.

The San Francisco Conference Fails

Secondly, in terms of the international political situation, the San Francisco Conference held by the United States in the hope of achieving considerable results resulted in the return of Soviet representative Molotov, the return of British representative Eden, and the announcement by Chongqing representative Song Ziwen that he would return to Chongqing. The effect of this conference is quite obvious. The United States, because it could not achieve its goals in the political arena, then discussed the issue of guaranteeing world peace, and proceeded in a legal manner. In addition, the issue of the occupation and management of islands around the world was announced, but a consensus could not be reached between Britain, the United States, the Soviet Union, Australia, Canada, and France. There were many hidden reefs. The San Francisco Conference, where the United States attempted to achieve its ideal hopes through politics, ended up forming a legal method and forming a small group meeting through technical means. The biggest reason for this is the issue of Poland. The dispute between Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union continued to brew, and no decision was made. The question of the Lublin regime in Poland, backed by the Soviet Union, and the arrest of Polish exiled political figures, once claimed that it itself was the most valuable regime representing Poland, but this has made it impossible for Britain to take measures. At the same time, Soviet Stalin broadcast on the 19th, specifically publishing three principles for resolving the Polish issue.

Since the 16th century, the Polish issue, which has harbored the greatest difficulties in history, we, from an objective standpoint, quietly observe the brewing of disputes between Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union, and seek solutions in what way.

Furthermore, the Soviet Union supports the Austrian regime, but the United States expressed its disapproval. And there is the Tito regime in South Yugoslavia, which recently advanced to the Adriatic Sea by force. The United States and Britain have unexpectedly claimed that they will respond to force with force before the conclusion of the treaty. Various disputes in Central Europe have sprouted and are growing.

The International Situation is Complex

In recent history, from the Baltic Sea to the Adriatic Sea, the Germanic and Slavic nations have continuously fought on both sides. Now that Germany has failed, it has now become an issue between the Pan-Slavic nations and the Anglo-Saxon and Latin nations, and has fallen into fierce struggles.

Regarding the handling of the war against Germany, the United Nations has established a committee. In the future, the handling of war criminals and prisoners by Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union, as well as the so-called industrial, cultural, and economic guidance, will gradually expose their opinions.

If we shift our focus and observe China, which is located in East Asia, the opposition between Yan'an and the Chongqing government is caused by Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union, just like in Europe.

As for the Near East and the Balkans, after years of the spread of the World War, the ties and equilibrium effects of the various small and weak countries need to be reorganized, so the confrontation between Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union in this issue will become more profound.

Regarding the common goal of Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union to defeat Germany, although they claim to cooperate with each other, in the future, a confrontational situation will be formed in the division of the world. Today's world is based on profit, so we have to consider the international situation in the future.

### Total Mobilization in Huaihai Province Established Implementation Committee, Headed by Governor Hao

Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 21st - Governor Hao of Huaihai Province, in view of the current extraordinary situation, to complete the war system, must mobilize all physical and mental strength. On the one hand, promote various construction projects, on the other hand, actively participate in joint defense to achieve final victory. He has specially organized the Huaihai Province Total Mobilization Implementation Committee, divided into the Spiritual and Human Resources Total Mobilization Committee. Total Mobilization Implementation Committee offices will be set up in each administrative inspectorate commissioner's office. Municipal and county governments will not set up separate institutions but will use the mayor and county magistrate as the center to supervise and direct the responsible agencies to implement the plan separately. District offices will set up Total Mobilization Practice Meetings, with the township head as the center, to implement various programs. Governor Hao will concurrently serve as the chairman of the Total Mobilization Implementation Committee, with one secretary-general, two deputy secretaries-general, nine standing committee members, and twelve committee members already appointed. As for the implementation items, in terms of spiritual mobilization, there are things like establishing a central ideology, advocating labor service, implementing dawn exercises, and popularizing national exercises. In terms of human resources mobilization, efforts will be made to increase agricultural production by farmers, implement military training for students, strengthen police defense corps training, strengthen rural self-defense corps, handle occupational registration, guide existing gang organizations, cooperate in water and land transport, organize women's associations, promote home-based side occupations, and universally organize mutual aid societies to stabilize people's livelihoods, etc. In terms of material resources mobilization, there will be efforts like ensuring civilian capital does not flow into bandit areas, increasing agricultural products to meet needs, revitalizing water conservancy, digging wells, opening canals, repairing dikes, reclaiming wasteland, cultivating mountains and forests, revitalizing mining industries such as coal and iron, implementing rural loans to regulate rural finance, universally promoting handicrafts, implementing partial economic control, encouraging rational allocation, and surveying living consumption output textile volume to regulate the supply and demand of materials. Actively organizing water and land transportation to strengthen the transportation of materials, making the supply of military and civilian needs increasingly smooth, etc. All of these programs have been drafted and will be implemented separately. The establishment of this Total Mobilization Implementation Committee not only features a strong and thorough organizational structure, but also each implementation plan has been carefully studied before being finalized. The measures are extremely detailed, and it is expected that ideal results will be achieved.

Editorial

### The Serious Problem of Commodity Prices

Commodity prices in this city have soared again in the past few days, and the lives of citizens are suffering a very serious threat. The relevant authorities really need to swiftly devise appropriate emergency measures.

We observe that there are several points regarding the recent rise in commodity prices in this city that are worth special attention: First, in terms of the cyclical rise in commodity prices. Although prices have been severe in the past few years, the period of the rising cycle has been either half a year or a seasonal increase, corresponding to the natural increase in currency. However, since the second half of last year, the situation has gradually become abnormal, and the distance between cycles has become closer and closer. Since the rising tide in February of this year, it has intensified, and a new high has appeared in less than two months. Unexpectedly, since the financial market turmoil in the middle of last month, a new surge has occurred again in one month; the relative period of stability has become shorter and shorter, so it is expected that the rising tide will continue unabated in the future.

Second, observing the recent several rounds of price increases, they have the above-mentioned characteristics, which are obviously not the direct result of currency inflation. The most noteworthy thing is that each rising tide is related to the international and domestic situation. We only need to briefly recall the international and domestic events at the beginning of last month to observe the rising tide in the middle of last month; then look at the international events at the beginning of this month to observe the new rising tide that began in the middle of this month, and we can fully understand that there are obvious signs that large speculators are taking advantage of the people's sense of unease and engaging in activities. If this is not addressed, there will be no day of stability in the market and society in the future.

It is also worth noting that this price increase is different from the previous ones. For example, the fluctuation in the middle of last month was triggered by the crazy jump in gold bars and stocks, and the financial market at the end of mid-April subsided due to the emergency measures taken by the authorities, but soon the rise in the market for daily necessities followed. This time, the price of gold has been temporarily stabilized by the issuance of gold securities; the market has not experienced major waves due to the crackdown on informal transactions; and the new rising tide of daily necessities has been entirely triggered by the surge in rice prices.

In summary, we can obtain the following concepts: First, this rising trend has followed the previous one almost immediately and is not entirely due to currency inflation; but at least it shows that although the issuance of gold securities has been successful, it has not been effective in withdrawing currency and stabilizing prices. Second, how to stabilize people's hearts and crack down on speculation, although it is an old saying, is still one of the most important parts of the price countermeasure; and economic police and other appropriate measures must not be relaxed in the slightest. Third, emergency measures should be taken for commodities and their prices that are sufficient to have a leading effect on price increases.

Regarding currency inflation, although the authorities have repeatedly declared it, we also believe it is the main reason for the recent rise in commodity prices. However, the public's lack of confidence in currency value requires obvious reforms to the authorities' past currency policies. Some people say that the recent lack of cash has caused considerable panic, so there is no need to contract the currency supply. This kind of argument that only sees the leaves and not the forest has no value. It must be known that the so-called lack of cash is artificial and is often a signal of new inflation, which everyone can see; and the most serious thing is that at a time when cash is scarce, credit currency suddenly expands, and banks and money shops issue a large number of notes that exceed actual needs, which is tantamount to helping the government accelerate currency inflation, so it is necessary to quickly devise appropriate countermeasures. In addition, we believe that it is necessary to effectively stabilize currency value and stabilize people's hearts. This is also the most effective countermeasure against the activities of speculators.

This time, the leader of the new wave of price increases is the jump in rice prices; and although this jump in rice prices is inevitably affected by speculators' manipulation and vendors' bidding, the main reason is actually the high rice prices in other ports, especially in Hangzhou and other places; This has resulted in a shortage of rice in the city. Therefore, we hope: First, that officials and the people will cooperate to dredge up sources of rice and prevent hoarding; Second, continue to hold down price rice to meet immediate needs; Third, restore household rice as much as possible, or at least distribute household food grains as soon as possible. If these three things are done or only part of them are done, at least the price of rice in this city and even the general price of commodities can be stabilized.

Of course, these are just emergency countermeasures. Fundamentally, as the Continental New Daily mentioned on the 18th, we must find ways to revive industry and dredge up sources of materials, solve the problems of coal, raw materials, and electricity for industrial use, and dredge up transportation, and ban illegal tax collection, etc. However, these methods are still not urgent enough today, so we should use this as a preparation for the fundamental treatment and first implement the above-mentioned emergency countermeasures to treat the symptoms. At the same time, how to adopt economic controls that are suitable for national conditions and improve all the technologies of economic controls, quickly adapt to the requirements of the new era, and make decisive measures to refresh the ears and eyes of the people, and can also achieve a real effect in stabilizing people's hearts and preventing speculation.

### Summary of the Work of the Ministry of Construction

Central News Agency, Nanjing, 21st - The Ministry of Construction received Chinese and foreign reporters at 3 p.m. on the 21st, and Liu Chuanliang, the chief secretary of the ministry, received them on behalf of the ministry, reported on the summary of the work in the past month, and answered questions from reporters. The following is a brief record: The most important tasks of the Ministry of Construction in the past month are the following: Regarding the construction of the Jingzhen Highway along the railway line, with the assistance of the Allied engineering corps, it has been completed a few days ago and can now be opened to traffic. The application for reclamation of the Yinshan Lake dredging project has been actively reviewed and processed by the office, and it has now been fully decided. Due to the high prices this month, the post offices, Huazhong Hydropower, Shanghai Jiaotong, China Shipping, Huazhong Railway, and other companies have increased postal rates and fares. It is not expected to increase prices again in the next two months. Following the order of the Executive Yuan, the Canal Engineering Bureau was taken over and managed at the beginning of this month, and the documents and other items have been transferred. The Ministry also sent personnel to take over the management of the Canal Engineering Bureau, which has not yet returned to Nanjing. Finally, reporters raised questions separately. The illegal behavior of black hats in the Huazhong Railway still exists. What countermeasures does the Ministry have? Answer: The Ministry has tried to improve the situation and is still actively seeking improvement. In the future, if we can eliminate black hats and illegal behavior, military law may be used to punish them, which may slightly kill this trend. The management of telephone communications in Nanjing. Because the telephones are often damaged for no reason, such as the illegal extortion of repair personnel, what countermeasures does the Ministry have in this regard? Answer: The Ministry has been working hard to rectify telephone communications. In the future, in addition to ordering the company to actively rectify the situation, we also hope that users will cooperate with the authorities. If unscrupulous employees commit extortion or other offenses, they should immediately report to the authorities so that they can be punished according to law. In this way, we can warn others and thoroughly eliminate this bad practice.

### Ministry of Finance Revises the Outline of Financial Institutions' Business

Central News Agency, Nanjing, 21st - The Ministry of Finance promulgated the "Outline for Strengthening the Business of Financial Institutions in Shanghai Special Municipality" on October 21 last year.

### Dispute Over Territorial Issues, Southern Country Sends Diplomatic Note to the US, US Undersecretary of State Issues Statement

Central News Agency, Lisbon, 21st - According to news received here: The US State Department received a document from the Yugoslav government a few days ago requesting the right to manage Trieste and the surrounding areas. US Undersecretary of State Grewte met with a group of reporters in Washington on Saturday and made the following statement. The contents of the document included a request by the Southern government for territorial changes and re-division, and a proposal to find a way to resolve the disagreement that suddenly arose between Southern personnel and the US Acting Secretary of State on May 12. Grewte also said that the US government should not use military occupation to resolve territorial disputes. Instead, it should adopt a method of reorganizing the allocation of territory to resolve the issue. However, the "patriotic elements" in the South intend to forcibly seize power and manage the area, which affects the US commander in the area's ability to maintain order or carry out the important task entrusted to him by the US government to govern the area and handle various issues after the occupation of Austria. The US government is currently discussing this difficult issue with other governments.

Southern Army Retreats from Carinthia

Central News Agency, Stockholm, 21st - According to a report from United Press International citing diplomatic sources in London: Yugoslav troops have withdrawn from Carinthia in southern Austria. This news has alleviated the serious situation caused by the occupation of areas such as Trieste.

Central News Agency, Berne, 21st - According to news from Paris: Authorities in Paris announced on Monday that the UK and the US are now forcibly suppressing France's immediate withdrawal of French troops deep into the Italian border, and at the same time, they have requested the government of the Southern country to withdraw the Southern troops from Trieste and its surrounding areas.

Soviet Union Supports Tito's Position

Central News Agency, Zurich, 11st [sic] - After the conflict between the Tito regime and the British and American military authorities over the occupation of Trieste worsened, Allied commander Alexander gave a special statement on the 19th, stating that this issue had been transferred to the British and American governments to negotiate directly with the Tito regime. Alexander also issued a notice to Tito stating that the UK and the US must continue to use the port of Trieste and maintain northern Italy and Austria with military force. The Soviet government has not yet issued a formal opinion on the Trieste issue. According to a report from Moscow, the Soviet government newspaper "News" published an interview with the Yugoslav Deputy Prime Minister Gordier on the 19th, which detailed the Southern country's claims on the issue and expressed support for its attitude.

### Soviet Union States Its Position on the Polish Issue

Central News Agency, Stockholm, 21st - Chairman Stalin sent a letter to the London Times on the 19th, responding to the Moscow correspondent of the London Times on the issue of the arrest of Polish dignitaries. At the same time, he broadcasted a speech, from which it can be seen that the Soviet government treats the arrest of Polish dignitaries and the reorganization of the Polish Provisional Government as completely separate issues. The issue of reorganization is less paused, and everything is the responsibility of the British and American governments.

### Commander of the Berlin Resistance, Hsu Ouna, Arrested

### True Ru Today

— Zhi Cheng

Ruined Walls and Broken Walls

Returning from the Jiading Nanxiang area and passing through Zhenru, I paid a visit. At the beginning of entering the town, the first thing that comes into view is some broken brick walls, standing firmly at the end of the city. These are the ruins of the war that year and appear very desolate. Most of the shops on both sides of the main street are grain stores. After crossing a small wooden bridge—Xianghua Bridge—you can see an old archway. Further ahead is a magnificent ancient temple—Wanshou Temple. According to local people, it was built in the Ming Dynasty and is several hundred years old. Judging from the antiques stored in the temple, the speculation is correct. For example, in the first hall, there sits a smiling Maitreya Buddha, made of bronze, with the eight characters "Made in March of the Yiyou Year of the Great Ming Dynasty" engraved on the back. Next to an iron incense burner in the hall, the words "Thirty-seventh Year of Qianlong" are also engraved. The second hall is the Great Hall of Heroes, about two zhang high. In addition to the complete Tathagata Buddha and several broken Arhats, nothing else remains. According to the elders of the local area, the source of the town's name "Zhenru" lies in this, because the Tathagata Buddha is molded very realistically, so everyone said: "Like a real Tathagata Buddha," and at that time it was named "Zhenru", and later it was changed to "Zhenru".

In the Luban Hall next to the main hall, various gamblers gathered, gambling openly in broad daylight, and no one interfered.

The organization of the town office is very simple, with only one town head and one staff member. In terms of security, when there were police stationed in the past, robbery cases often occurred, but now it is very peaceful. However, there are at least one or two petty theft cases every night, and most of these people are opium addicts without jobs.

The liveliest market in Zhenru is the vegetable market in the morning, because the local fields are planted with vegetables, and not a single grain of rice is produced, so it is completely dependent on the Nanxiang area, which is transported by vendors, and the price is of course high. Except for vegetables and rice, most commodity prices are 20% higher than in Shanghai.

Education and Medicine

Education was very developed in the past, but after the outbreak of the Shanghai War, the school buildings of various schools were all turned into ruins, so that singing and music were interrupted; later, although there were one or two enthusiastic people who were preparing to set up schools to remedy the situation, but because of the simple and crude conditions, it was impossible to expand; therefore, Li Peisheng and others, through various difficulties, founded Zhenguang Elementary School in January of the 32nd year, and the opening expenses were all obtained from donations from fellow villagers in Shanghai, and the regular expenses were all dependent on tuition income, with 80% of the tuition used for teachers' salaries and the remainder used for office expenses. The tuition fees charged were also lower than those of other schools, only the price of a bucket of rice, and there are currently 325 students. There are also free places for poor children.

In terms of local medicine, there is practically no equipment except for one or two private clinics. Therefore, every summer, when epidemics breed, one feels helpless. The enthusiastic people of the town have therefore organized a free medical clinic, which has been running for four sessions and has achieved excellent results. Each session saves more than 3,000 civilians. The expenses and medicines are all donated by various sectors. At the end of each session, the deficit is compensated by the Zhenguang Elementary School's charity ball games, with the proceeds from the ticket sales used to compensate the expenses. Since its establishment, it has been praised by people from all walks of life for its sound organization and clear accounts. This year, prices have soared and funds are not available, and we hope that people from all walks of life will donate generously.

### Civil Defense Headquarters to Strengthen Air Defense Facilities Starting Next Month, Adding Air Raid Shelters and Increasing Self-Flowing Wells

In order to strengthen air defense facilities, the Civil Defense Headquarters will hold a "Strengthening Air Defense Facilities" campaign from June 1 to 9. The main points are: Add small air raid shelters: The working office of the headquarters will open eight small air raid shelters in various parts of the city for people to visit and arouse the public to imitate the opening of shelters. At the same time, large air raid shelters that have been built will be sorted out, modified, and improved. Organize water storage ponds. Add self-flowing wells, call on the public to open drinking water wells, which can not only cope with air defense water, but also use the well water as a beverage. Organize an inspection team to send personnel to organize a household-by-household survey: (A) Fire extinguishing equipment (B) Work equipment (C) First aid supplies (D) Equipment for lighting control and other air defense facilities. Those with perfect facilities will be rewarded, and those with inadequate facilities will be corrected in order to thoroughly strengthen air defense facilities.

Radio Broadcast Prevention Measures: In order to enable the citizens of Shanghai to respond calmly when enemy planes are found to be attacking, the Shanghai Radio Station and the Da Dong Radio Station, in accordance with the instructions of the air defense authorities, will recently broadcast various preparations that should be made in air defense, such as the discovery that enemy planes will invade Shanghai, or the absence of enemy planes around Shanghai, as well as air defense activities, in both Chinese and Japanese languages. All self-defense corps instructors in the city must listen at any time, follow the instructions, and act quickly to respond to enemy air raid prevention measures and implement evacuation in order to avoid temporary confusion. Therefore, citizens must step up preparations. It has been found that in the Allied country of Japan, when an air raid occurs, the movements of enemy planes will be broadcast by radio, so that citizens can respond calmly, which not only does not hinder production, but also reduces the number of injured. Therefore, broadcasting the news of enemy plane movements is an urgent need, and the above-mentioned two radio stations in the city are now preparing for it.

### Commemorating Allied Navy Day, Regular Lecture Meeting to be Held, Shanghai Branch of the News Association to Host

In order to commemorate the 40th Navy Day of the Allied country of Japan, the Shanghai Branch of the China News Association will hold a lecture meeting at the Da Guangming Theater at 5 p.m. on the 26th of this month. The meeting will be given by the Minister of Naval Information Matsushima, and the China Film Studio's famous film "Thousands of Households Renewed" will be shown. A lecture meeting will be held at the Da Hua Theater at 10 a.m. on the 27th of this month. Principal Jiang of the Central Naval Academy will give a lecture, and the China Film Studio's new film "Don't Forget Tonight" will be shown. Middle school, university, and vocational school students in the city who wish to attend the lecture must prepare an official letter with the school seal, stating the number of people planning to attend the lecture and the date (26 or 27), and submit it to the Shanghai Branch of the China News Association at 160 Da Shanghai Road before 5 p.m. today (22). After the association has completed the statistics, it will issue seating tickets and publish a notice for collection.

### Second Issue of Gold Certificates Begins Issuance Yesterday

After the listing price for the second issue of gold certificates was determined to be 8.3 million yuan per tael, the Shanghai branch of the Central Reserve Bank continued its issuance yesterday (the 21st) until the 23rd. Local banks, money shops, and citizens continued to enthusiastically purchase them. Due to the continued issuance of gold certificates, idle capital is gradually concentrating on gold certificates. Consequently, trading in the black market and public debt/Chinese stocks is sluggish, and market conditions are becoming more stable. The speculative atmosphere has visibly subsided.

### Finance Bureau Adjusts License Fees for Pawnshops

The Municipal Finance Bureau, based on a joint petition from the pawnshop associations, requested an adjustment to the pawn tax to equalize the burden. After investigation, the bureau's method of collecting pawn taxes stipulated that, before the concessions were recovered, the old city area was taxed based on total capital. Later, this pawn tax was changed to a business license fee. Because the fees have increased year by year, pawnshops were taxed at 12 per mille and loan businesses at 50 per mille. In contrast, the former public and French concessions levied taxes based on capital or working capital (i.e., rolling capital), which was considered harsh. No adjustments were made after the concessions were recovered. The Finance Bureau believes there is a genuine need to adapt to the current situation and re-adjust the fees. Starting this spring, the old license fee rates will be calculated based on the total capital of each member, divided into five levels. Those with capital of 1 million yuan or more will be classified as Grade A, with a quarterly fee of 10,000 yuan. Capital between 700,000 yuan and 1 million yuan will be classified as Grade B, with a quarterly fee of 9,000 yuan. Capital between 410,000 yuan and 700,000 yuan will be classified as Grade C, with a quarterly fee of 7,000 yuan. Capital between 210,000 yuan and 400,000 yuan will be classified as Grade D, with a quarterly fee of 5,000 yuan. Those with capital under 200,000 yuan will be classified as Grade E, with a quarterly fee of 4,000 yuan. The capital registration certificate issued by the Bureau of Economy will be used as the standard for determining the grade. The plan will be implemented after being submitted to the Municipal Government for approval through the Bureau of Economy.

The South Tonglu Middle School Council, in response to the thousands of homeless compatriots displaced by the fires on Yaorao Road and Xiaoshadu Road, who have no home to return to and are exposed to the elements, has decided to distribute rice to disaster victims, which is too sad to be observed. In addition to sending personnel to fight, the council, with the support of enthusiastic benefactors, plans to temporarily issue 4 jin (斤) of white rice and 4 jin of red beans per person for relief. Registration will begin today in separate locations. For Yaorao Road, registration can be done at the Yaorao Road branch; for Xiaoshadu Road, registration can be done at the general headquarters at 1275 Changshou Road (i.e., Robison Road).

Donations in Commemoration of Turning Over a New Leaf

High school student Xia Zhiheng came and said: "I am a high school student. Although my parents are not very wealthy, they can still barely afford my tuition. But I cannot earnestly and diligently study books. Thinking of the pain of poor students who want to study but cannot afford to, I cannot help but feel ashamed. From now on, I want to resolve to change my ways and strive for knowledge. I am specially sending 4,000 yuan, 2,000 yuan for scholarship funds and 2,000 yuan for the Yaorao Road fire relief, as a commemoration of turning over a new leaf."
