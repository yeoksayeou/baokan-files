Several large fires broke out. Furthermore, the enemy positions there were fiercely bombed again on the night of the 24th.

Tokyo, 25th (Central News Agency Telegram) - One week has passed since the enemy landed on Iwo Jima on the 19th. Due to the valiant fighting of the Japanese garrison on the island, the enemy has been unable to advance. The Japanese forces are still securing key positions such as Mount Suribachi, continuing to inflict significant damage on the enemy. At 9:00 AM on the 23rd, the enemy launched an attack on Asoga with a force of about one company, carrying tanks. The Japanese artillery units accurately shelled them, destroying one tank and killing or wounding 200 infantry soldiers, repelling the attack. At 3:00 PM that afternoon, the enemy again attacked Kita-Oka, north of the Chishima settlement, with 300 infantry soldiers and three tanks. The Japanese garrison engaged them in fierce fighting for one hour, completely annihilating one company of the enemy and destroying one of their tanks. By 4:00 PM, the enemy had ceased their attack and began to collect their wounded. Furthermore, from 6:00 PM to 7:00 PM on the 23rd, the Japanese Air Force attacked enemy naval vessels off the coast of Iwo Jima, confirming that one unidentified vessel caught fire and sank, while another vessel suffered an explosion in its stern. In addition, five fires could be seen burning at sea from a distance. A unit of the Japanese Air Force bombed the enemy bridgehead on the southern coast, throwing the enemy into great chaos. Starting from the evening of the day until dawn on the 24th, the entire Japanese line launched a major assault operation, capturing a large number of tanks. However, the detailed battle results have not yet been determined. From the start of the enemy landing operation until the 22nd, the ground battle results include the destruction of 160 tanks, the bombing and burning of numerous cargo trucks, ammunition, and supplies, and the killing or wounding of 17,000 enemy soldiers by the evening of the 22nd.

### New Life Movement Revised; First Phase of Practice Items

Nanjing, 25th (Central News Agency Telegram) - The New Life Movement Promotion Committee, in order to strengthen the close training of the general public, has planned to actively launch the organization of New Life Movement practice groups from all sectors. With the promotion of the New Life Movement practice movement as the focus of its work, the committee has specifically revised the "First Phase of Practice Items for the New Life Movement Action Regulations." The original text is extracted below:

Since the first day of the 31st year of the Republic, leader and former Chairman Wang personally promulgated the essential points of the New Life Movement to unite the people and strengthen the organization and training of the people. Focus on concentration of will and enrich the national strength to advance simultaneously in both spiritual and material construction, so as to be able to bear the great mission of rejuvenating China and protecting East Asia. The so-called spiritual construction often focuses on removing shortcomings and developing strengths. The leader, in the outline of the New Life Movement, clearly pointed out that the Sino-Japanese Incident, which has been going on for more than four years, has transformed into a great war to protect East Asia. Without a new spirit at this new juncture, how can we shoulder this new responsibility and accomplish this mission? The so-called new spirit does not completely refer to creation, as long as the pollution of old habits can be removed, it is also a step towards self-renewal. In other words, there must be the courage to admit shortcomings, correct shortcomings, and especially weaknesses. There must be even more courage to sweep away and clarify. The New Life Movement focuses on this. Today, the promotion of the New Life Movement has entered the practical stage. In terms of spiritual construction, we should first target the inherent shortcomings of our nation, that is, the so-called pollution of old habits, and seek to eliminate and clarify them. At the same time, we should further seek to develop and expand the strengths of the people, creating a new spirit of national glory and vigor. Then, not only can material construction be successful, but also the initial foundation for completing the great cause of rejuvenating China and protecting Asia will be laid. Based on this goal, the "Practice Items for the New Life Movement Action Regulations" are promulgated, hoping that the people of the country will rise up together, embody them, and put them into practice. The first year, from March to August of this year, is designated as the promotion period. The practice items are as follows:

Editorial

### The Problem of Streamlining Administration

The problem of streamlining administration has been repeatedly raised by our newspaper two years ago. At that time, due to various conditions, it could not be realized immediately, so as to bring politics into a normal track. In terms of time, it was not long ago. However, a transformation or a reform must have a certain process. When the so-called time is ripe, it will be easy to achieve. Now this problem of streamlining administration has become the government's policy to strengthen politics and stabilize people's livelihood due to the demands of our public opinion circles. This is a very gratifying thing in politics this year.

Secondly, in the past, orders from above were not followed below. Subordinates or local administrative institutions often neglected government orders. But now? It is different. For example, recently, the central government has adopted two principles to adapt to the needs of wartime and seek ways to streamline administration, and has formulated measures and clearly announced their implementation. Shanghai, which is an important administrative unit in the country, was able to take the lead in implementing reforms in accordance with the central government's streamlining plan. Mayor Zhou's first resolution report at the Shanghai Municipal Advisory Committee fully reflects the will of the central government to simplify administration and also fully demonstrates the spirit of unified government orders.

The principles and measures promulgated by the central government are the principles to guide the implementation of streamlining administration throughout the country. The reforms of the Shanghai Municipal Government and Mayor Zhou's work report have two very important points in promoting the significance of streamlining administration. (1) Shanghai is the most important part of the country's administrative units. The authorities first implemented streamlining administration, which clearly has the meaning of making Shanghai a model streamlined administration area. (2) The entire work plan is a concrete practice of implementing streamlining administration, which meets the needs of the citizens of Shanghai. What the citizens of Shanghai need can also be needed by the people of the whole country, so its concrete practice can be used as a reference for other administrative units to implement streamlining administration.

The ultimate goal of streamlining administration is to improve administrative efficiency. Therefore, the central government's decision to seek ways to streamline administration is very simple. There are only two principles, and the provisions of these principles are very clear. One is to change the organization (including mergers and additions), and the other is to strive for simplicity in the review of institutions and procedures. This explains the spirit of the central government's streamlining administration. As far as the Shanghai Municipal Government, which has gradually implemented streamlining administration, is concerned, it also focuses on improving administrative efficiency. Therefore, Mayor Zhou put "internal rectification" in the first part of his report to the advisory committee. The first is to reduce the size of the organization. The reduction of the organization is to eliminate the phenomenon of redundant layers, which can save manpower and resources, thereby eliminating the factors that erode administrative efficiency, such as "unclear responsibilities, unclear powers, mutual competition for benefits, and mutual evasion of responsibilities," so it did not hesitate to merge the Public Works Bureau and the Public Affairs Bureau into the Construction Bureau. At the same time, in order to adapt to the needs of the real environment, it also added the "County Administration Management Office" and the "Population Evacuation Committee." In terms of employment, "the people used by the County Administration Management Office are limited to a very small number, and the people working for the Population Evacuation Committee are all transferred." Based on these points, the simplification of the Shanghai Municipal Government can very well develop the current spirit of streamlining administration. Only by thoroughly implementing these points first can the second point of cutting unnecessary redundant staff, the third point of enforcing discipline, and the fourth point of improving treatment be thoroughly realized.

The gist of streamlining administration is "simple laws and convenient people," which, if put in current terms, means stabilizing people's livelihood. This point is related to improving administrative efficiency, so Mayor Zhou mentioned that when it comes to the focus of general facilities, putting the reorganization of finance as the first item. In this way, on the one hand, all income is attributed to the government, so as to balance revenue and expenditure, so as not to affect the promotion of streamlining administration. On the other hand, adjust donations and taxes so as not to burden the people too much. At the same time, it makes every effort to prevent artificial price increases and achieve the task of establishing security, and also improve blockade management. These all prove that the municipal authorities have great determination and enthusiasm for implementing streamlining administration.

Improving administrative efficiency is easier to implement, but stabilizing people's livelihood is very difficult. Therefore, Mayor Zhou said in his report when mentioning the point of stabilizing people's livelihood: "In the few months before and after I took office, the price of rice was slightly stable, and everyone attributed it to me, saying that the price of rice fell because I became mayor. This is just a coincidence, not my merit. I dare not take credit for what belongs to Heaven and think that I already have it. A few days ago, the price of rice suddenly rose, and if the responsibility for this is said to be entirely borne by the city government, which is empty-handed, it is too harsh." After Mayor Zhou frankly stated the difficulties of the municipal government, the people have a concrete understanding and understanding. However, the current price of rice is no longer the same as it was a week ago. If we let it develop naturally, then the past situation may be repeated, becoming an obstacle to streamlining administration.

In addition, we feel that streamlining administration must be thoroughly implemented. The central government has already clearly announced the principles and measures. We hope that the Shanghai Municipal Government will make efforts to achieve its implementation based on the established work plan and truly become a model for the whole country. At the same time, we hope that the authorities of other provinces, cities, and counties will follow suit and implement streamlining administration. After the murder occurred, the Congress immediately adjourned. The news quickly spread throughout Cairo. The police immediately dispatched a large number of people to prevent unrest. The Speaker of the House announced that Congress was limited to one exit. Anyone leaving the House will be subject to strict inspection and must present their certificate.

Stockholm, Sweden, 25th (Central News Agency Telegram) - German News Agency reports from Cairo that Egyptian King Farouk has instructed Foreign Minister Muklashy to act as Prime Minister. It is generally expected that there will be no changes in the government. It is said that Foreign Minister Muklashy has always been the right-hand man of the late Prime Minister Maher.

### Anglo-American Forces' 40 Divisions Launch Offensive on Western Front; Massive Deployment of Aircraft and Heavy Artillery

Berlin, February 25th, Central News Agency dispatch: A German news agency reports that a German military spokesperson announced yesterday that the Anglo-American forces have mobilized a total of 40 divisions in their current offensive on the Western Front. The offensive is expected to extend to neighboring areas soon, with the battle lines on the Western Front projected to reach 200 kilometers in length.

Berlin, February 25th, Central News Agency dispatch, Huitong News Agency report: The Allied forces' new offensive in the Aachen area involves an unprecedented deployment of aircraft and artillery since the invasion of Europe. The Allied air power used during the Normandy landings was less than that deployed in the Ruhr area in the past 24 hours. This demonstrates the importance the Allied command attaches to this large-scale offensive. The offensive is currently underway in a concentrated manner within a 40-kilometer zone between Linnich and Geilenkirchen. On the northern route, the Canadian 10th Corps and the British 2nd Corps are launching large-scale offensives. On the southern route, the US 3rd Army is also launching a large-scale offensive. The US 1st and 9th Armies are attempting to reach the east bank of the Ruhr River, and despite heavy losses, they have successfully crossed the river at several points. By Friday evening, the furthest advance of US troops on the east bank was only three kilometers. US tank divisions have mostly not yet joined the battle, awaiting orders. The war on the Western Front is now developing towards its peak.

### Hitler's Declaration: Struggle for Survival

Berlin, February 25th, Central News Agency dispatch: A German news agency reports that yesterday marked the 25th anniversary of the National Socialist Party's declaration of its twenty-five principles. Führer Hitler addressed the old comrades of the party, stating, "February 24, 1920, will be a great milestone in human history. Without the construction of the National Socialist Party, there would be no Germany and no German nation today. Heaven does not pity weak nations, only acknowledging the right of healthy and strong nations to exist. The unnatural alliance of capitalism and communism now threatens the world with death. Twenty-five years ago, Germany was prepared to challenge this threat to defend the survival of the German nation. Today, Germany must overcome the bourgeois democratic ideals and eliminate communism." The Führer's speech was delivered yesterday by State Councilor Esser at a meeting of old comrades in Munich.

### City Police Bureau Smashes Major Gambling Den; Den Owner Wang Maoting and Others All Apprehended

The City Police Bureau has received numerous confidential reports that a criminal named Wang Maoting has been using the Russian General Association at 147 Weihaiwei Road as a front for a private gambling den, attracting crowds to gamble. This is extremely illegal. While under strict investigation, the den owner brazenly attempted to bribe Director Li of the Xin cheng sub-bureau, the responsible authority, with 300,000 yuan, attempting to operate privately like the gambling dens in the Nanshi area in the past. After receiving the bribe, Director Li immediately reported it to his superiors and also reported the details of the "Big Road Pai Gow," "Hua Yu," "Big and Small Tables," "Roulette" and "French Baccarat" gambling equipment inside the gambling den, as well as the internal operations, requesting instructions for handling the case. The Bureau immediately ordered the Third Division to quickly investigate and crack the case.

Setting Up a Secret Trap to Arrest Wang Maoting

After receiving the order, the head of the Third Division, Li Shi, immediately transferred the case to Liu Shaokui, the investigation and trial section chief, and Liu Junqing, the third section director of the Xin cheng sub-bureau, the responsible authority. They each dispatched detectives to conduct a strict investigation. Section Chief Liu then dispatched detective chief Shi Weimeng to cooperate with Zhou Wenqing, detective of the third section of the Xin cheng sub-bureau, selected by Director Liu, as well as detectives Li Dewei and Lu Yuheng to work together to solve the case. However, in order to apprehend Wang Maoting first and then smash the gambling den without making a sound, so as to catch everyone in one fell swoop, a plan was discussed and decided in advance, and a secret trap was set up. On the afternoon of the day before yesterday, detectives gathered at the gambling den, pretending to be gamblers, secretly monitoring Wang Mao's activities. At 8:40 PM, Wang, along with his son Wang Shuhao and friend Sun Huanting, left in a car. The detectives had been waiting nearby and followed them to the intersection of Chongqing Road, where they stopped the car under the guise of inspection and took Wang back to the Xin cheng sub-bureau. Section Chief Liu and Director Liu interrogated him in detail, and Wang confessed to the aforementioned situation, stating that he had put up about 6 million yuan to open the gambling den at the Russian Overseas Chinese Association, signed a contract with a Russian, and hired a person named Meng Qing to manage the operation. After discussion and decision by Director Li, Section Chief Liu, and Director Liu, and with the approval of their superiors, they personally led police officers to the Russian Overseas Chinese Association.

Surrounding the Gambling Den, Catching Everyone in One Fell Swoop

Led by Director Li, Section Chief Liu, and Director Liu, dozens of police officers secretly surrounded the gambling den with armed police officers first. Then, detectives rushed into the gambling den. Just as the gamblers were in high spirits, using lightning-fast methods, they went to the gambling rooms on the first, second, and third floors, separated the gamblers, and immediately seized six dice cups, six sets of Pai Gow, three large bags of chips, 32 French Baccarat gambling equipment, four rosewood copper plates, one roulette gambling equipment, three small safes, six small iron boxes, three rosewood long planks, and other gambling equipment, as well as 2,644,150 yuan in cash, five remittance slips totaling 178,000 yuan, seven checks totaling 670,000 yuan, and seven promissory notes totaling 210,000 yuan. In the pawn department on the third floor, they confiscated a small gold bar, five gold bracelets, two diamond rings, one platinum ring, thirteen gold rings, three gold pocket watches, one gold chain, one pocket watch, and one small round watch. The gambling den's staff counted the items on the spot, and the suspects were taken to the bureau for investigation.

Arresting Hundreds of Gambling Offenders

A total of 174 gamblers and employees were arrested in this case, including six Japanese nationals, three French nationals (who have been handed over to their respective consulates for investigation), one Portuguese national, one Spanish national, two Indian nationals, one Danish national, and thirty Russian nationals. The rest were all Chinese nationals, including ninety-nine men and thirty-one women. Yang Lianfu, an employee of the gambling den, jumped out of a window in an attempt to escape, resulting in serious injuries, and has been sent to the hospital for treatment.

### Fresh Meat Retailers Fail to Comply with New Price Limits

Fresh meat prices had previously soared to 1,000 yuan per catty due to the Lunar New Year holidays. Based on the central government's policy of suppressing and stabilizing prices, the Municipal Price Evaluation Council took emergency measures, initially re-establishing price limits for the top sixteen major commodities. Fresh meat was also among the major commodities, with first-class meat set at 800 yuan per catty, second-class at 750 yuan, and third-class at 400 yuan. However, the general selling price on the market still does not comply with the price limit. Among the unpriced items, such as pig liver, the price has soared to 1,600 yuan per catty. It is hoped that the evaluation authorities will quickly order the industry to comply and also quickly price the unpriced pork parts to relieve the public food supply.

### Stores Raising Prices Privately Can Be Reported to the Police

The authorities, recognizing that soaring prices in the city have a huge impact on the stability of people's livelihoods, have issued fixed prices for major items and strongly declared their determination to suppress and stabilize prices. Since implementation, most speculative merchants have complied. Citizens have expressed their support for the authorities' decisive measures. According to a reporter's investigation, a small number of limited-price items have violated the assessed prices again. Such a situation is deplorable. It is reported that the relevant parties are currently conducting strict investigations. Citizens can directly report stores raising prices privately to the Fourth Division of the City Police Bureau, and they will be severely punished.

### City Finance Bureau Streamlines Tax Collection

Since Director Luo took office, the City Finance Bureau has been very active in adjusting the new finances. The internal structure has been completely refreshed. The newly established Supervisory Section is conducting a very strict investigation into the malpractices of merchants evading and leaking taxes. Illegal acts by financial administrative tax collection personnel are no longer seen. In addition to the adjusted consumption tax rate that has been implemented, the adjustment of business license fees and property donations, as well as the opening of business tax collection in the old No. 18 and No. 2 districts, have been approved by the municipal government and the Ministry of Finance and will be implemented in sequence. It is expected that the city's finances will improve in the future, and the unified collection and expenditure will tend to balance.

### Gaoqiao District Collects Excess Land Tax; Requesting Municipal Government Correction; Special Commissioner Gong Wenhuan Has Been Sent to Investigate

The Pudong Native Place Association Councilor Zhong Yuliang submitted a proposal to the council regarding the overcollection of land tax in Gaoqiao District, which was passed by the council and submitted to the municipal government for correction. Special Commissioner Gong Wenhuan was sent to investigate. Councilor Zhong's proposal stated: "Land tax is a national tax and a basic element in guaranteeing people's property rights. Our people uphold the tradition of paying national taxes early, and paying land tax is a wealthy obligation. Unless there is extreme poverty or a year of famine, they will not deliberately delay payment and face punishment. In the event of natural disasters, war, or poor harvests, they must rely on wise officials to sympathize with the people's suffering, assess the autumn harvest, and reduce or exempt taxes to protect the people. Extra charges are strictly prohibited. According to the fixed rate of land tax in Shanghai Special Municipality in the 33rd year of the Republic, as announced by the Municipal Finance Bureau, the upper-grade land is taxed at 180 yuan per mu, and the lower-grade land is taxed at 151.2 yuan per mu. In addition, 150 yuan is collected for military police rice. These amounts are very clear. It has now been discovered that the actual collection situation in the Shangqiao District is that the upper-grade land is taxed at 600 yuan per mu, and the lower-grade land is taxed at 545 yuan per mu, which is very different from the fixed amount. If there are any additional collection fees, they should be announced in advance or marked on the voucher, so that they are clear. However, because these procedures are not available, people are concerned. When asked about the collection staff, they cannot explain in detail, and there may be extra fees. At a time when people's livelihoods are difficult, they cannot bear the burden. This Association is sincerely concerned about the local area and submits this proposal to the municipal government to investigate and correct the situation, in order to eliminate extra charges and alleviate the people's suffering."

### Financial, Industrial, and Market Conditions in Shanghai This Past Week; "Haiti Bonds" and Others See Fierce Price Increases

Financial, industrial, and market conditions in Shanghai in the past week have fluctuated sharply due to rumors about the European situation. General speculative funds have all shifted to "Haiti Bonds" and Russian imperial activities. Therefore, in the financial sector, the "Haiti Bonds" saw the most fierce price increases, with the highest peak exceeding the closing price of the black market before the big settlement by a huge margin. The surge in momentum on Wednesday and Thursday was shocking. Later, many bulls saw the opportunity to take profits and sell in large quantities, and sentiment weakened slightly, causing prices to fall. By Saturday, the price had fallen by more than nine points, but it was still more than 30% higher than the previous week. The rise in public bonds was not as weak as the "Haiti Bonds", but there were fewer buyers than the "Haiti Bonds", because people tend to buy gold as a good strategy. Although the Chinese stock market was buoyant due to loose monetary conditions and bull absorption, leading to a period of fierce price increases, only the popular stocks of Wing On Company, Wing On Textile Mill, and Mayer Silk Factory saw active trading. The general public views the stock market with indifference, and it is not yet the time to revitalize the stock market. Within the financial sector this week, due to the lingering customs of the Lunar New Year, each industry has not yet started to operate in a big way, so there is nothing to report. The daily interest rate for money changers remained unchanged at 65 cents, but the black market rate continued to rise. Regarding industry and commerce, factories in various industries are still unable to start production due to the lack of electricity, which affects the rise in prices. Fortunately, the Municipal Economic Bureau has taken emergency measures to suppress and stabilize prices, re-approving sixteen kinds, four of which are monopolized products, so they were not approved for public release. The new price limits for major commodities have been announced and implemented, and the Economic Police Bureau is assisting in the enforcement. As a result, price increases are prevented from escalating. However, on Friday and Saturday, rice prices rose again, and the wholesale prices of other daily necessities continued to rise. This has disappointed the expectations of the price suppression authorities and the general public. It is hoped that the economic enforcement authorities will not ignore this type of development, and quickly investigate and verify the root cause and enforce severe penalties in order to meet the purpose of stabilizing people's livelihoods.

### Boiled Water Shops Raise Prices Without Permission

Boiled water sold in the city's boiled water shops has been raised without permission. The authorities then stipulated that the price should be 15 yuan per ladle. Recently, the boiled water shops have ignored the price limit and raised the price to 30 yuan per ladle without permission. It is hoped that the authorities will pay attention.

### Citizens of This City Should Rapidly Build Air Raid Shelters: Police Bureau Deputy Director Xue Broadcasts

Xue Zhiliang, Deputy Director of the Second Division of the Shanghai Special City Police Bureau, recently broadcast on Shanghai Radio the significance of citizens constructing air raid shelters. The gist of his message was:

Remarkable Effectiveness

Currently, the weakest point in the air defense posture is the slow construction of air raid shelters. An ancient saying goes, "Prevent trouble before it happens," and "Preparedness prevents misfortune." Now, in the face of bombing risks in Britain and Germany, the lives of ordinary citizens in major cities, as well as all vital institutions and factories, are generally secured underground, in what are called air raid shelters. The construction of air raid shelters is quite widespread in major cities in Japan. Although B-29 bombers have repeatedly attacked in recent times, the number of casualties has been minimal. Furthermore, according to the reports of personnel dispatched by this bureau to Hankou for on-site investigation, the enemy employed carpet bombing, yet the Japanese suffered no casualties. Upon investigation, the reason was the widespread use of air raid shelters, the remarkable effectiveness of which in protecting lives has been fully proven. Looking at the air raid shelters in Shanghai, they are indeed not very developed; this is a fact. Every family, all citizens, factories, banks, companies, shops, and all other public places in Shanghai must not leave anyone behind during air raids and must take shelter. We hope that all citizens will rapidly construct air raid shelters to ensure safety.

Construction Locations

The construction of air raid shelters requires selecting appropriate locations, and the construction methods need to be concrete. The materials should be simple and easy to obtain, and the coordination of construction tools must be consistent. However, despite various difficulties, in light of the air defense situation in Shanghai, it is necessary to overcome all obstacles and eliminate all difficulties. We have now entered a state of urgently building air raid shelters. The place of construction should first be selected near one's own residence as the standard, so that in the event of an air raid, one can reach the location most quickly and take shelter immediately. In general households, whether to set up air raid shelters outside or inside the house can be decided individually. That is, if there is suitable open space near the residence, it can also be used. Furthermore, in densely populated residential areas, if there is no suitable open space nearby, then choose a place in the house that is relatively strong and easy to take shelter in for construction. I think there are no obstacles, as long as you find the availability of suitable open space. If it is not suitable for construction inside the house, you can also choose public open space on the road. However, due to the presence of underground public gas pipes, water pipes, underground electrical wires, and other buried objects, it is necessary to request permission from the Municipal Government Works Bureau. The Municipal Government will definitely provide convenience for this request, so please do not hesitate to apply to the police substation under your jurisdiction at any time.

Construction Methods

Next, there are various different construction methods. In the current situation in Shanghai, dig underground to the extent that water does not seep in, and then pile soil on the ground, which is called a semi-underground style. The size depends on the number of people it can accommodate, with a maximum of fifteen people per shelter. Two entrances and exits must be set up, using strong wood, bamboo, laurel wood beams, and the exterior is piled with soil, covered with decks or mats, and then covered with soil and sand to a depth of one foot. There should be no bricks, tiles, or pebbles nearby to prevent the danger of shrapnel from anti-aircraft shells scattering into the soil and sand. Next, sturdy objects must be installed at both entrances to prevent blasts. Special attention must be paid to hygiene and preventing leaks inside. This is what the builder or manager needs to pay attention to on a regular basis. Whether there are any leaks in the shelter, whether the soil around the air raid shelter is strong or not, and whether there are bricks, tiles, and shrapnel nearby should be checked. If there are, they must be removed to prevent danger.

Building Cellars

Air raid cellars (basements) are used to store valuables, important items, and other necessary items to prevent fire. Underground cellars are extremely effective in preventing fires, as proven by many real-world examples. In experiments in Japan, the temperature inside a burning house reached very high Celsius temperatures. Inside a cellar 15 centimeters deep below ground in this house, the temperature was only around 20 degrees Celsius. Stored items such as ledgers, clothing, food, and even highly flammable volatile oils showed no abnormalities. During air raids or air defense activities, it is necessary to have a cellar to store important items to prevent danger and avoid worries. In case of emergency evacuation, it is impossible to carry valuables, important items, or daily necessities. To ensure the safety of the majority of evacuees, it is strictly forbidden to carry items. Therefore, each household must have a cellar to protect important items and store easily flammable and dangerous items inside.

Cellar Structure

Cellars can be set up indoors or outdoors. The size should be appropriate for storing items. The structure of the cellar is best made of reinforced concrete or bricks. If these are not available, wooden boxes, iron boxes, or discarded Western bathtubs can be used. Bury them underground, store valuables and food items inside, cover them well, and pile sand and soil on top to a thickness of 30 centimeters (about one foot). (Points to note) Prevent bricks and tiles from damaging the cellar due to the collapse of the building and excessive weight, and avoid hindering evacuation. Also, prevent water from entering the cellar and soaking the items inside. Be sure to quickly load the items into the cellar during evacuation, and the equipment must be complete. The above is a brief statement, and we hope that all citizens will follow it.
