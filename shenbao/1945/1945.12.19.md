### Chairman Chiang Speaks to Foreign Reporters, The US Policy Towards China Remains Unchanged, Showing That Truman Understands the Current Situation in China

[Associated Press, Beiping, 18th Dispatch] Chairman Chiang met with Chinese and foreign reporters at the airport command room today. After a few hurried words, he and his wife boarded the plane and departed for the capital. According to Chairman Chiang, he was very pleased that President Truman reiterated the US policy towards China, stating that it has not changed. Now "President Truman's statement shows that he is very clear about the current situation in China. I mentioned the expansion of the foundation of the Chinese government in my speech on March 1, which is also one of the goals of the National Assembly." The National Assembly is scheduled to be convened on May 5 next year. The Chairman expects to meet US Special Envoy to China General Marshall in Nanjing or Hankou. According to information obtained here, Marshall will arrive in Shanghai on the 20th of this month. A reporter asked Chairman Chiang whether he felt that President Truman's statement implied that the United States expected the Chairman to make a fuller compromise with the Communist Party. After Madame Chiang translated, the Chairman replied: "What President Truman said in his statement is what I have advocated for the past three years. I hope that the Kuomintang and the Communist Party can implement a peaceful and friendly solution." Due to time constraints, the Chairman did not express his views on the current situation in the Nine Eastern Provinces, the US reconstruction loan to China, and the convening of the Political Consultative Conference. A reporter asked whether the hope of national unity had increased after the arrival of the CCP representatives in Chongqing. The Chairman replied: "I only received the news of their arrival yesterday, and I don't know what their attitude is. As for negotiating peace with the CCP militarily, it is what I want. The compromise between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party also depends on the CCP's attitude towards President Truman's declaration, and I don't know if the CCP can accept this declaration." According to the United States' insistence that China should not have an independent army, such as the CCP's Eighth Route Army, which is separate from the National Army, the Chairman's words probably refer to this. Chairman and Mrs. Chiang's visit to Beiping lasted exactly one week.

Madame Chiang then left by car, and we also drove to the airport. The conference was finally held in the airport command room, and the reporters raised three important topics, to which the Chairman replied in the best diplomatic manner.

It is said that this attitude shows that the focus of American foreign policy has generally changed. The US State Department may place Far Eastern interests in the first place and put Europe in second place.

[Central News Agency, London, 18th] London generally believes that the Moscow Foreign Ministers' Conference has included the Far East issue on the agenda. The fact that British Foreign Office Far East Director Bennett accompanied Foreign Secretary Bevin to the Soviet Union is a clear sign that they will discuss this issue.

[Reuters, Moscow, 18th] The progress of the Three-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference is very confidential. Yesterday, the English and Russian broadcasts of the Moscow Radio Station did not comment on the conference. However, it is learned that after the three foreign ministers engaged in preliminary talks on the level of the issue on Sunday night, they have entered the stage of formal talks. British Foreign Secretary Bevin and US Secretary of State Byrnes summoned advisors and ambassadors early yesterday morning to discuss and study the latest instructions from their respective governments. Since the Three-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference was held, Soviet newspapers have published articles on atomic bombs, land trusteeship, and UN organizations from time to time.

Another telegram, the second meeting of the Moscow Conference, ended last night, lasting a total of two hours and twenty minutes. No communiqué was issued after the meeting, and all parties maintained strict silence.

[Reuters, Moscow, 18th] Authoritative sources here said today that the Foreign Ministers' Conference has "made a good start". This morning, British Foreign Secretary Bevin and US Secretary of State Byrnes are both preparing for the third meeting this afternoon, and Bevin also intends to visit Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov before the meeting. All details about the agenda and discussion are still kept secret. Chairman Stalin has returned to Moscow after vacationing in Sochi on the Caucasus Black Sea coast. The announcement of this matter was welcomed by the Soviet people. Stalin's return to Beijing is to handle heavy official duties, and it is expected that the various rumors widely spread overseas will end with this announcement.

[United Press, Moscow, 17th] After the first meeting yesterday, British Foreign Secretary Bevin revealed at a press conference that they had agreed to the suggestion made by US Secretary of State Byrnes to hold the next Foreign Ministers' Conference within three months. It is also learned that the United States hopes that the next Three-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference will be held in Washington.

### The Situation in Iran is Worsening, Making the Task of the Moscow Conference More Complicated. The United States Asserts that the Revolution in Northern Iran Did Not Occur Automatically

[Reuters, Moscow, 18th] It is reported that British Foreign Secretary Bevin received a follow-up report on the Iranian incident yesterday.

[Reuters, Washington, 18th] According to authoritative sources close to the government, the US government has determined that the revolutionary movement in northern Iran did not occur automatically. However, the source did not want to comment on other matters.

[Reuters, London, 18th] According to well-informed sources in London, the worsening situation in Iran will inevitably complicate the task of the Moscow Conference. The UN organization relies on the harmony of opinions between the Soviet Union, Britain, and the United States. However, the three countries now have different attitudes towards the domestic situation in Iran, and behind the dispute between the Iranian government and the Azerbaijani autonomous elements, there is actually the entire issue of the great powers' security and strategic needs in the Middle East. The disturbed area is now expanding, failing to prevent disturbances from affecting the Kurdish people in Iraq and Turkey. Diplomatically, there are suggestions that the Iranian government can directly appeal to Britain and the United States for assistance. Judging from the rhetoric of the Soviet newspapers and the radio, the Soviet government wants to recognize this issue as part of the general situation in the Middle East and conduct a comprehensive discussion on the stationing of troops by the great powers in the Middle East region. Therefore, well-informed sources in London believe that the initial exchange of views at the Foreign Ministers' Conference is an attempt to agree on the limits of the discussion of the incident. The Foreign Ministers' Conference wants to base itself on mutual trust before starting major discussions and agree on the possibility of a common policy. It is obviously not easier to achieve due to the victory of the Azerbaijani autonomous elements in Tabriz. Officials said that the Moscow Conference is exploratory in nature, but in order to restore peace in the Middle East, the Foreign Ministers' Conference must have concrete agreements, which is quite obvious. Stalin's return to Moscow indicates that the three-nation talks are now gradually moving beyond the initial exchange of views.

British Newspaper Editorial Questions the Soviet Union

[Reuters, Manchester, 18th] The Manchester Guardian commented today: If the British and American foreign ministers are wise, they should refuse to participate in the debate over whether Iran is democratic. Whether the Azerbaijani people's movement is an uprising of oppressed Turks and Kurds, or an automatic uprising of Iranian farmers and workers. Regardless of whether the accusations of various parties are true, without the support of the Soviet Union, the people's movement would never have expanded to its current extent, and the Iranian government would not have had to suppress it. What we should understand is the Soviet Union's intentions. If the Soviet Union only intends to improve Iran's local government, why not jointly exert pressure on the Iranian government with Britain and the United States? But if the Soviet Union intends to separate Azerbaijan from Iran before withdrawing its troops in March next year, then we have the right to ask the Soviet Union, how can it violate the treaty by taking this action, and at the same time, it intends to read its explanation of the purpose of this move.

### Election of Judges of the International Court of Justice Begins Next Month

China Nominates Xu Mo to Participate in the Election

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 18th] China has nominated Ambassador Xu Mo as a candidate for judge of the International Court of Justice to participate in the election. Ambassador Xu is a well-known jurist internationally. More than 30 candidates have been nominated by Allied countries to participate in the election, which will be elected by representatives of various Allied countries at the United Nations General Assembly and the Security Council to be convened in January. The number of judges of the International Court of Justice is 15, with a term of nine years, one-third of whom are re-elected every three years.

### Canadian Prime Minister Reports to Parliament on the Discussion of Atomic Energy, Preventing War Requires International Cooperation

[Associated Press, Ottawa, 17th] Canadian Prime Minister Mackenzie King reported to Parliament today for the first time on the discussions on atomic energy by the United States, Britain, and Canada a month ago, stating: Organizing a world government, with each country handing over part of its national sovereignty, is the only solution to the various problems caused by the atomic bomb and the atomic age. It is a mistake to regard atomic energy as a dangerous new drug and want to control its use in commerce and peace. It is essential to manage the production, manufacture, and final distribution of atomic energy technically and scientifically, but it is obviously not enough. If we imagine that human peace and unity can be achieved with a commodity control plan, its foolishness is beyond description. Therefore, the final solution to the various problems caused by the atomic age can only be found in the philosophical scope. All countries also recognize that the mechanical solution to atomic energy, the agency that controls atomic energy, is at most a temporary expedient. Although the UN organization is the first step in establishing a world government, it is not enough to solve this problem. After all countries hand over part of their sovereignty, a new world government must be established, at least initially its powers are limited to preventing war and maintaining world security. The invention of the atomic bomb has opened our eyes and seen that if the UN organization cannot complete effective international cooperation, the world's future will encounter terrible developments.

### Sukarno Advises People to Adopt Gandhi's Philosophy

[Reuters, Batavia, 18th] Indonesian Republic President Sukarno broadcast to the people of Java on the radio yesterday, instructing them to adopt Gandhi's philosophy. Briefly stated: We should resist violence with the power of our hearts. Every Indonesian should obey the instructions of its leader, otherwise the work of saving the country will be delayed. We should intensify the reclamation of land so that food can be produced in large quantities, and we should continue to work hard and engage in the exchange of goods. According to reports, Sukarno's speech was delivered on the eve of leading Cabinet Prime Minister Sjahrir and Information Minister Sharifuddin on a tour.

[Reuters, London, 18th] Foreign Secretary McNeil stated in the House of Commons yesterday that although the British government intends to encourage direct negotiations between the Netherlands and Indonesia, it does not believe that sending a delegation to Java at this time can help direct negotiations.

[Associated Press, Batavia, 18th] Senior UN military staff officer Davis said: The anti-aircraft gunners of the Javanese independent army were trained by the Japanese army and shot accurately. Therefore, the losses suffered by the British army were heavier than those suffered when fighting the Japanese army in Burma. The British Air Force in Java has lost thirteen or fourteen aircraft so far.

### Former Financial Advisor to China, Kemmerer, Dies

Suggested Issuing "Sun Currency"

[United Press, New York, 17th] It was announced here last night: Professor Kemmerer, an international monetary expert who served as a financial advisor to the Chinese government from 1929 to 1930, died of illness shortly after, at the age of 70. In the past thirty-one years, Kemmerer had served as a financial advisor to fourteen countries and had many economic writings, and his report advocating China's restoration of the gold standard was the most famous in China. He suggested establishing the "Sun Currency" gold standard, with each "Sun Currency" of two and a half yuan equaling one US dollar. However, although the Chinese government strongly advocated the issuance of a new currency unit called "Sun Currency" in the midst of stabilizing the currency system, it has not yet been implemented.

### US Secretary of the Navy Suggests that the United States Transfer Surplus Ships to China to Help Rebuild Our Navy

[Associated Press, Washington, 17th] US Secretary of the Navy Forrestal submitted a bill today to enable President Truman to transfer the remaining ships of the United States to China. Forrestal said in a letter to House Speaker Rayburn: "From the perspective of national justice and conscience, the United States should assist China in maintaining its navy, which will make a practical contribution to maintaining peace in the Pacific." The bill submitted by Forrestal would allow the president to sell, exchange, lease, or give the remaining ships to China, and assign officers and recruits to assist China's naval work. Forrestal also said that this suggestion is based on the recent recommendations of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the Foreign Affairs, Land, and Sea Tripartite Coordination Committee. The White House also has instructions to the Navy Department.

[Associated Press, Kansas City, 17th] A person named Baker, who was captured by the Japanese in Bataan Peninsula in 1942 and detained in a concentration camp for three years and eight months, volunteered today and applied to MacArthur by airmail to be allowed to serve as the executioner when he was hanged.

### Yokohama Court Gloomy - Japanese War Criminal First Trial - "Little Glass Eyes" Listens to Indictment with Composure

[United Press Tokyo, 18th] At the preliminary hearing of Japanese war criminals this afternoon, the court will be requested to sentence Tsuchiya, formerly a guard at a prisoner-of-war camp, also known as "Little Glass Eyes," to death. Chief Prosecutor Major Jeffen stated that he could demonstrate that "Little Glass Eyes'" treatment of Allied prisoners of war was truly that of a "demon and sadist." Tsuchiya was brought into the gloomy Yokohama court for trial this afternoon, and questioning began immediately. Tsuchiya denied all the charges against him. Before the trial, the defendant's lead defense attorney, Lieutenant Colonel Dickinson, objected to one of the nine members of the military tribunal on the grounds of bias. This person was Colonel Bauer, who had been a prisoner of war of the Japanese army for three years after the fall of the Philippines. After investigation, Bauer admitted that he might be biased against the Japanese under certain circumstances. At 1:30 p.m. (Tokyo time), the defendant was escorted into the crowded courtroom by armed guards. The defendant, dressed in gray, appeared composed as he stood before the trial panel and listened to the indictment. The indictment was read simultaneously in English and Japanese, conveyed by a translator. He indicated that he understood all the charges. The defendant's lawyer tried to have two of the eight counts dismissed, but without success. The relevant clause of the indictment stated, "The defendant forced prisoners of war to line up and slap each other and arbitrarily disposed of Red Cross supplies." The defendant's personal translator, Australian Captain Clark, told American reporters that "Little Glass Eyes" was quite pleased with the execution of the trial and thanked those who defended him. The indictment stated that "Tsuchiya whipped a sick American prisoner of war to death with a thick rope. The victim who died from his injuries was named Gordon."

### The Japanese Cabinet's Position is Precarious - Rumors Suggest No Reorganization Before Next Year's Election - Parliament Ended Yesterday and Will Soon be Dissolved

[United Press International, Tokyo, 18th] Sources close to Prime Minister Shidehara said today that rumors that the cabinet had decided to resign on the 23rd of this month are unfounded. However, yesterday's cabinet meeting decided to dissolve the Japanese parliament after today's special session adjourns. Today is the 22nd day of the special session, and the rumors that the cabinet will resign on the 23rd may have originated from this. Representative Mitamura declared in the House committee that the Japanese government's various domestic reforms are being carried out under orders, without any independent initiative. Nakatani also criticized the Japanese government for often neglecting the Japanese parliament when implementing MacArthur's orders. The government replied that if the Japanese parliament had to approve MacArthur's orders in advance, the implementation of these orders would be slow. According to the government, the Shidehara cabinet will not resign before the general election in January of next year. Leaders of various political parties apparently want to do their best to maintain the precarious Shidehara cabinet through this year, pending the general election to be held in January of next year.

### British Study Chemical - to Manufacture Penicillin

[Reuters, London, 18th] Three British scientists from Oxford are the first to manufacture artificial penicillin. They manufactured penicillin using chemicals instead of cultivated soil. The three are Sir Robinson, a 58-year-old professor of chemistry and president of the Royal Academy, who is currently in Paris receiving an honorary degree from the Sorbonne, Dr. Chain, a Nobel laureate, and Dr. Abraham, a biochemist who studied with Sir Robinson. The penicillin discovered in 1943, extracted from soil, is a mixture of four substances. To manufacture a penicillin molecule, it is necessary to quickly connect 14 atoms of carbon, 20 atoms of hydrogen, 4 atoms of oxygen, 2 atoms of nitrogen, and 1 atom of sulfur. Before Robinson and others began their research, only soil containing penicillin blue element could connect them, but Robinson and others finally discovered a chemical substance with the same bactericidal ability as penicillin blue element. These synthetic manufacturing methods have been repeatedly tested in the UK and the US and are continuing to be researched for mass production.

### Local dispatches

Songjiang

Township and Village Elementary Schools Appeal for Relief

The township and village-established elementary schools in Tangqiao West Dongjing and other townships in Songjiang County have been in operation for more than three months. The initial principle was to raise funds from the local area, but since the start of the school year, the township and village chiefs have made many excuses, and no funds have been raised to date. The principals of each school are worried about running out of funds and facing starvation, but because national education is a top priority for the future, they have not dared to shut down hastily. They have recently jointly submitted a request for relief to the county district office and hope that people who are concerned about public education and local education enthusiasts will quickly find ways to maintain the schools.

Wuxi

Troops Dispatched to Suppress Lake Bandits on Ma Ji Mountain

Ma Ji Mountain in Taihu Lake belongs to the jurisdiction of the Tenth District of Wujin County. In the past, it was occupied by treacherous bandits. After the enemy puppets surrendered, the bandits also withdrew to other places. However, the other day, a person claiming to be Zhang Zhendong, the district chief of Ma Shan, led his gang of forty or fifty bandits to the mountain to extort public grain from the households. Those who were late in paying were immediately flogged. The district chief Wu Pingzhai reported the matter and telegraphed the county government to dispatch troops to suppress the bandits. Yesterday afternoon, a platoon of soldiers from the Second Battalion of the County Security Force stationed in Xueyan Bridge, along with an eighty-man district defense team, crossed the lake by boat and launched an attack, advancing towards Peach Blossom Bay in the western part of Tan Shan, the bandit's stronghold. After two hours of fighting, they killed several bandits and captured one alive. Under the cover of night, the bandits boarded boats loaded with the collected grain and sailed away. It is reported that District Chief Wu has submitted a report to the county government on the incident and has requested that troops be stationed there permanently.

### Konoe's Memoirs - Recounts Friction with Matsuoka Yosuke Before the Outbreak of the US-Japan War

[United Press International, Tokyo, 18th] Konoe Fumimaro's memoirs, left behind after his suicide, state that before the outbreak of the Pacific War, the United States had proposed a plan to Japan that, if accepted, could have avoided war between Japan and the United States. Unfortunately, the Japanese reply was delayed for eight days. During those eight days, former Foreign Minister Matsuoka Yosuke probed the attitude of German officials towards the US-Japan negotiations. However, key figures in the Japanese army, navy, and political circles believed that the US proposal was sufficient to resolve the Sino-Japanese conflict and should not be delayed. Matsuoka then sent the reply to the US authorities. Matsuoka was stubborn, self-willed and quick-tempered, and even suggested that the US and Japan conclude a neutrality treaty, but this was rejected by US Secretary of State Hull. After sending out the reply, Matsuoka received a response from Germany stating that they were willing to use the US-Japan negotiations to prevent the US from supplying materials to Britain, and encouraged Japan to threaten the US that if the US continued to supply Britain, Japan would join the war. Konoe's memoirs also state that as early as seven months before the Pearl Harbor incident, some people had argued that Japan must declare war on the United States. Matsuoka reported to the Emperor on June 8 that if Japan wanted to participate in the war, it must cooperate with Germany and Italy. Konoe consulted Yamamoto, commander of the Japanese Combined Fleet, on the issue of joining the war, asking him about the chances of success or failure. Yamamoto replied that if the war had a definite time limit, Japan could fight for half a year without problems, but if the war lasted for two or three years, he could not guarantee a victory. After hearing this, Konoe had a long talk with Matsuoka at the airport when he returned from Europe, but Matsuoka showed almost no interest in the US proposal. On the night of April 22, 1941, Matsuoka reported on his trip to Europe in a loud and harsh tone. When discussing the US proposal, Matsuoka expressed great excitement and pointed out that Germany fully trusted Japan based on the Tripartite Pact. The US proposal contained 70% malice and only 30% goodwill. Matsuoka delayed the reply to the US proposal, but he did not propose any modifications to the content of the proposal. The final modifications were approved by the cabinet on May 3, 1941, the second day after Matsuoka returned from Europe. The US proposal stipulated that Japan should not advance into the South Pacific, which would guarantee that neither the US nor Japan could establish a base in the South Pacific that would threaten the other country. However, Matsuoka opposed this and deleted it, adding a supplementary clause advocating that when the war between Britain and Germany reached the point where Germany was about to win, the US and Japan should mediate to end the European war. After the proposal was revised, the Japanese cabinet was eager to send the reply to the US government, but Matsuoka delayed it again.

Matsuoka notified Nomura, the Japanese ambassador to the US, instructing him to make a temporary reply to US Secretary of State Hull, suggesting the conclusion of a US-Japan neutrality treaty, pretending that this suggestion came from Nomura's personal opinion. Nomura sent the neutrality treaty proposal to Hull on July 5, but Hull did not consider it. Hull's attitude during this negotiation was unusually firm, which was rare for him, and he strongly stated that the US-Japan negotiations should be held as soon as possible. Matsuoka dispatched Sakamoto, Director of the East Asia Bureau of the Foreign Ministry, to notify the German and Italian ambassadors to Japan that the Japanese government had indeed received secret proposals regarding the adjustment of diplomatic relations. When the German ambassador visited Matsuoka, Matsuoka asked German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop for his opinion, saying that whether retaliating against US malice or resolving the China Incident, Germany would benefit in any case. At that time, Matsuoka also said to the Emperor that if the US participated in the war (the European war), Japan should join Germany and Italy. At this time, adjusting US-Japan relations would be futile. If Japan trusted Germany and Italy and still spent so much time discussing the US issue, he would resign. One of the amendments made by Japan to the US proposal, which deleted the clause guaranteeing no advance into the South, was delivered to Hull as late as November 15. Hull expressed great suspicion about this. After the final Japanese reply was sent, it received a note from Germany stating that the US was willing to compromise with Japan, the intention of which was to end the war against Germany, and the Japanese government should immediately state: (1) Japan believes that the US transporting convoys to supply Britain with materials is intentionally creating a war. (2) If the US stops this action, then Japan should consider the US proposal. The German government also hoped that Japan could notify Germany in advance when sending the final reply, so the friction between the cabinet and Matsuoka gradually increased. Even the Emperor Hirohito gradually lost trust in Matsuoka and even consulted on whether Matsuoka could be dismissed, but Matsuoka's stubborn attitude towards the US did not change as a result. Konoe's memoirs state: "Judging from Matsuoka's words and deeds, I suspect whether he made important promises to Germany during his stay in Germany. According to Matsuoka's report, Hitler and Ribbentrop both insisted that Japan should attack Singapore: Although Japanese leaders had hoped that the US-Japan negotiations would end in success, this hope ultimately proved illusory."

### Konoe Asked Emperor to - Withdraw Japanese Troops from China

His Secretary Niuma Announced

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 17th, United Press] Konoe's secretary, Niuma, revealed that when Konoe resigned as Prime Minister in October 1941, he presented a memorial to the Emperor requesting the withdrawal of Japanese troops from China to avoid war with the United States. Konoe stated that Tojo opposed this proposal because it might affect the morale of the Japanese army. Tojo believed that if Japan yielded, the United States would become even more unrestrained and arrogant. Although the "China Incident" might be resolved temporarily, Sino-Japanese relations would inevitably break down within two or three years. Konoe's memorial to the Emperor stated that Tojo insisted that we must actively and quickly decide on the time to launch the war. He had four meetings with Tojo, but ultimately failed to persuade him to accept his opinion, so he felt unable to fulfill his important task of assisting His Majesty.

### A Glimpse of Life in Hong Kong - People from Southwest China Pouring in - Authorities Striving to Restore Normalcy of Supply

— Special Correspondent of this Newspaper, Lin Youlan

The trains from Guangzhou to Hong Kong are crowded, and black market tickets have appeared. Seats on flights from Chongqing to Hong Kong are fully booked until February of next year. People from mainland China are flocking to this prosperous island on the southern coast. I recently traveled to Hong Kong and found myself in a different atmosphere, far from my homeland. I have many observations. I will try to report to the readers of this newspaper what I have seen and heard.

After three years and eight months of Japanese occupation, Hong Kong is no longer what it used to be. The main change is that the Japanese have eliminated most of the British atmosphere. The Queen's Statue Square on the Central waterfront, which was once used by the British military honor guard to welcome distinguished guests to Hong Kong, has had its surrounding bronze statues, including the one of Queen Victoria in the center, completely removed. The pair of bronze lions in front of the HSBC bank and the statues of the British monarchs have also become raw materials for factories in Osaka.

### Artificial Beauty - Destroyed Almost Completely by Ezo

The Japanese have destroyed almost all of Hong Kong's carefully constructed artificial beauty. The Japanese built defensive fortifications in Hong Kong's parks, cutting down flowers and trees, smashing chairs and railings. The former places of leisure have now become barren hills. The clocks in Gloucester Road, the Unified Wharf, and the Tsim Sha Tsui Wharf have all been damaged and cannot tell the time. In order to implement security measures, the Japanese have blocked many roads. The most obvious is the section connecting Connaught Road and Des Voeux Road on the coast of Sai Wan, which is dimly lit at night and looks like a ghost town. The street lights on the Peak, which used to look like strings of pearls, have disappeared.

The ugliness that the Japanese brought to Hong Kong is also very obvious. The Japanese removed the three flagpoles on the top of Victoria Peak, the highest mountain on Hong Kong Island, but built a so-called "Loyalty Pagoda" on Wan Chai Hill, where the fiercest fighting in Hong Kong occurred. Its clumsy form is visible from afar, making people unhappy. The Japanese rebuilt the Hong Kong Governor's Mansion, with its soaring pavilions and yellow tile roofs, which is very out of harmony with the nearby white high-rise buildings and green hills. The orange-yellow buses on Hong Kong Island, the green buses across the Kowloon Peninsula, and the shuttle-like gold-edged taxis have all disappeared. (Since October 1, the military government has returned a small number of remaining public buses painted dark gray to contractors. There are only six of these buses on the entire Kowloon Peninsula!) The alternative means of transportation are bicycles and tricycles. Imagine a well-dressed young woman sitting on the back of a bicycle, or two or three young gentlemen being transported across the street by tricycles like goods. What a sight!

### General Prices - Four to Five Times Higher Than During the War

Before the war, there were many things about Hong Kong that people missed, and its low cost of living was especially unforgettable. But today, general prices in Hong Kong are four to five times higher than during the war. For example, going to a teahouse in the morning, a plate of dim sum that cost five cents before the war now costs two to three dimes. A pound of beef that cost four dimes before the war now costs two dollars. Ordinary vegetables that cost five to eight cents per pound before the war now cost two to four dimes. Ordinary houses that rented for thirty dollars per month before the war now cost one hundred to one hundred and fifty dollars. High-quality leather shoes that cost fifteen to twenty dollars a pair before the war cannot be bought for less than one hundred dollars now. Ordinary Western suits that cost thirty to forty dollars a set before the war now cost at least two hundred and fifty to three hundred dollars. A newspaper that cost two cents to buy before the war now costs ten cents. Books published by the Commercial Press and the Chung Hwa Book Company are sold at four times the list price instead of 90% of the list price before the war. In terms of transportation, the streetcar fare was three cents for third class and six cents for first class before the war, now it is eight cents for third class and one and a half dimes for first class. Public buses cost five cents for second class and one dime for first class before the war, now it costs two dimes for all classes. The ferry fare has not increased for first class, but the third class fare has increased from three cents before the war to five cents. The fare for a rickshaw was at least ten cents before the war, now it costs two dimes.

### Government Administration: Implementing New Price Control Measures

Among the various commodities, the price of firewood and rice have remained relatively stable. Rice is sold at five catties per dollar, and firewood at six dollars per load, both at the official price with no black market activity. This must be recognized as a unique advantage of the Hong Kong government's administration, and it deserves to be emphasized here, perhaps as a reference for our compatriots.

As I, the reporter, write this, I would like to take the opportunity to discuss the Hong Kong authorities' response to the current problem of the high cost of living. They are firmly grasping the principle of monetary contraction, instructing civil servants and employees of other commercial institutions to be paid according to pre-war standards. However, to cope with current needs, a living allowance of thirty dollars is added across all ranks. This is obviously still not enough to make ends meet, but the authorities believe this is a transitional phenomenon that everyone needs to understand and endure. This is because the exchange rate of the Hong Kong dollar has been fixed at one shilling and two pence per Hong Kong dollar. The main reason for the current high prices is that the supply system has not yet fully recovered. In the future, as transportation becomes smoother, markets recover, and goods flood in, prices will only fall and will certainly not rise. The British Shipping Authority has already redeployed a large number of ships to carry goods to the Far East, and ships have also been dispatched from India to carry coal and groceries to Hong Kong to help the authorities suppress the high tide of prices. I, the reporter, have interviewed merchants from various sectors all day, and they believe the above reasons are credible and that the suffering of the current high cost of living in Hong Kong is temporary. This statement may serve as an explanation for the continuous stream of mainland people moving to Hong Kong, but its accuracy remains to be proven by future events.

### Fully Equipped: New First Army Passes Through Hong Kong En Route North

In addition to civilians, the continuous stream of people coming to Hong Kong also includes troops from our country's New First Army, passing through Hong Kong en route north. These well-equipped soldiers are stationed in camps that were previously converted from civilian houses by the Japanese army. The camps consist of small Western-style houses interspersed with trees, creating a beautiful scene, located in northern Kowloon Tong, opposite Hong Kong Island. There is an open space in the middle, separated from the civilian houses in the south. On the open space, the National Army has built a rostrum, flying the national flag, creating a magnificent sight. Below the open space, merchants have set up a temporary small market specifically for the National Army to purchase food and fuel. In front of the camp, there is a wide road (Waterloo Road) that leads directly to the city center. I, the reporter, went to visit yesterday morning, and on the way, I saw three battalions of the National Army passing through the city center after morning exercises, full of energy and marching in good order. Many wounded Japanese soldiers, supported by female nurses, looked down from the windows of a church (which had been converted into a wounded soldiers' hospital by the Japanese) by the roadside. I privately rejoiced at being able to witness this unusual scene, but I wonder what those three or five dwarves were thinking in their hearts!

The highest-ranking officer of the National Army coming to Hong Kong from Guangzhou, Division Commander Pan Yu-kun, is an old acquaintance of Major General Festing, the current Commander of the British Army in Hong Kong, from the battlefields of Burma. Hong Kong's overseas Chinese, upon seeing the majestic appearance of the National Army, were moved by their great contribution to the motherland and organized comfort activities. The Hong Kong and Kowloon District Three People's Principles Youth League launched a movement to entertain the National Army, and has obtained the consent of major cinemas, restaurants, and tea houses to provide free entertainment to the National Army.

### First Batch of National Army: Warmly Welcomed by Hong Kong Overseas Chinese

The first batch of over a hundred National Army soldiers were led by the Youth League on the eighth to visit various places, enjoy tea and snacks at the Datong Restaurant, and watch a movie at the Entertainment Theatre before returning in high spirits. In addition, a musical concert was held to entertain the troops, and a shoe-shining fundraising campaign was launched. The Political Department of the New First Army also sent a Hong Kong and Macau Comfort Delegation to Hong Kong to convey the government's gratitude for the care of the overseas Chinese and to strengthen the overseas Chinese's understanding of the glorious victory. The connection between Hong Kong's overseas Chinese and the motherland has become even closer as a result. General Luo Zhuoying, Chairman of Guangdong Province, followed General Chen Ce, Mayor of Guangzhou, and came to Hong Kong on the tenth in response to the invitation of senior British military officers to visit Guangzhou. The cordial relationship between China and Britain has a very significant impact on today's Hong Kong. (Sent from Hong Kong Island on December 10th)

### Review of Prices for Yarn, Cotton, Flour, and Wheat

— Zhu Shuxun

In recent days, commodity prices in this city have been on a downward trend, and the people's lives can gradually return to normal. However, after reading the recent economic news in various newspapers, I deeply feel that the prices of industrial manufactured goods in this city are still far from the prices of agricultural raw materials, which is not suitable. The reason for this is that some manufacturers seem unable to take a broad perspective. Here, I will discuss the prices of major commodities such as cotton yarn, cotton, flour, and wheat as follows.

Review of Major Commodity Prices

Last week (December 3rd to 8th), the price of 20-count miscellaneous yarn fluctuated around 400,000 yuan, while 16-count yarn was about 300,000 yuan. The raw cotton for 20-count yarn, fine Tongzhou cotton, was priced at 40,000 to 50,000 yuan per dan, while the raw cotton for 16-count yarn, coarse Taicang cotton, was around 30,000 yuan. Assuming that one piece of 20-count cotton yarn requires three and a half dan of raw cotton, and each dan is priced at 40,000 yuan, the cost of raw cotton per piece is only 140,000 yuan. Adding processing costs of about 80,000 yuan, plus profit, the total cost of one piece of 20-count yarn should not exceed 200,000 yuan. However, in reality, the selling price is above 400,000 yuan. (At that time, newspapers reported that the highest price for 20-count Double Horse yarn from the Shenxin Factory was 640,000 yuan, and the lowest was 480,000 yuan.) At the same time, the normal barter ratio on the market is about ten dan of raw cotton to one piece of cotton yarn. If the above facts are verified, then about six dan of raw cotton can be exchanged for one piece of cotton yarn (three and a half dan of raw materials plus two and a half dan of processing fees). Furthermore, we can also review the cost of yarn and cotton before the Pacific War and before the August 13th Incident to clarify the difference in the exchange rate between cotton yarn and raw materials (cotton) before and after the war.

Around May of the 28th year of the Republic (1939), this newspaper's economic column published an article by Long Ju-sheng titled "Hidden Worries About the Future of Yarn and Cloth," which stated (the price of American cotton, middling, for 20-count yarn was 82.9 yuan per dan, Indian cotton, white Lok, was 72.1 yuan, and Tongche cotton was about 89 yuan. Calculating that each piece of yarn requires 350 catties of cotton, the cost of cotton is 280 yuan. Adding processing fees of 40 yuan, some factories that spin 20-count yarn have processing fees of 40 to 50 yuan, including 20 yuan for manufacturing costs, 15 yuan for management and operating expenses, and 5 to 6 yuan for financial expenses. The total cost of each piece of yarn is 320 to 330 yuan, and it is currently sold for 380 to 390 yuan, so each piece of yarn can earn about 60 to 70 yuan...) This shows that in the 28th year of the Republic, the price of yarn was about 400 yuan, and the price of cotton was about 80 yuan, so five dan of cotton could be exchanged for one piece of cotton yarn. Going back even further, Jiang Diguang wrote an article titled "A Review of the Cotton Industry in the 24th Year of the Republic" in the third issue of the third volume of the "Social Economic Monthly," which provided a very detailed statistical analysis of the market prices of standard yarn and cotton that year. Here is an excerpt from the statistical table for December of the 24th year of the Republic:

Comparative Table of Standard Yarn and Cotton Market Prices for December of the 24th Year of the Republic (Unit: Yuan)

Standard Cotton Yarn Highest 202.00
Lowest 191.90
Average 196.90

Standard Cotton Highest 43.00
Lowest 40.45
Average 41.27

According to this table, it can be seen that before the August 13th Incident, one piece of cotton yarn could not even be exchanged for five dan of cotton. Therefore, the so-called barter trade in the current market, which averages five dan of cotton to exchange for one piece of cotton yarn before the war, means that one piece of cotton yarn is equivalent to the price of about five dan of raw cotton. Compared with the current market price of ten dan of cotton for one piece of yarn, it is exactly doubled. Is this reasonable? One cannot help but doubt it.

The Price Gap Should Not Be Too Wide

Although, manufacturers have their own difficulties, and the high cost of current expenses such as power, preparation, production, management, and interest payments is undeniable. However, we always hope that the foundation of the business should be considered from a broad perspective, prepared firmly, and the vision should be focused on the long term. This is a point that everyone must clearly recognize. This is no longer the era of enemy puppets occupying and exploiting us. This is an era of self-reliance, restoration, and regeneration. The price gap between raw materials and finished products should not be too wide, because (1) low raw material prices will affect their productivity, and we are not advocating a high-price raw material policy. We only want what is reasonable and conforms to the natural level of barter - although barter is temporary - (2) high finished product prices will weaken purchasing power in society. As for the price of flour, the main food in this city, last week it was around 2,500 yuan per bag (44 catties), but the price of the raw material wheat was only 2,500 yuan per 100 catties. The current market price standard for flour and wheat is also based on this ratio. Generally, we only know that 100 catties of wheat can produce about 70 catties of flour, with the remaining 30 to 40 catties of bran used for manufacturing and other expenses. Therefore, the trend of 44 catties of flour per bag being exchanged for the same price as 100 catties of raw wheat is unreasonable, similar to the situation with yarn and cotton mentioned above. (In recent days, flour mills have been bartering, exchanging 100 bags of flour for 100 dan of wheat.) Therefore, we must correct this kind of distorted price that violates natural principles and still exists on the road to victory and restoration; otherwise, we cannot consider it reasonable. I, the writer, solemnly propose that manufacturers pay special attention. When the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) is selling low-priced relief flour, it is also hoped that they will determine a reasonable selling price for flour based on the cost of domestic and foreign wheat and manufacturing expenses to lighten the burden on the people. In short, it is hoped that the prices of raw materials and finished products will be adjusted reasonably as soon as possible, and that we will focus on our business efforts!

### The Blood Debt of Nazism: The Hadamar Killing Factory

A dispatch by United Press Correspondent Anderson

On the sixteenth, this newspaper published a shocking special dispatch from Nanjing, which described how the cruel and insidious Japanese army demonstrated their consistent brutality in a way that was simply outrageous. Now, we want to expose the crimes of European fascist Germany—the so-called ally of Japan—in the same way. If careful readers compare these two dispatches, they can at least understand that Germany and Japan are two brutal and inherently violent twin brothers in the world, and that the consequences, the utter defeat and destruction of all inhuman villains, are inevitable. The author of this article, Godfrey H. B. Anderson, is a United Press war correspondent who was captured by the German army in Africa and released by the US First Army. This article recounts the inside story of this Nazi killing factory, which is chilling to read. —Editor

A Mental Asylum: Terror Suffocates Hearts

I entered the Hadamar killing factory, just like the 40,000 people who came before me. But, I am not like those 40,000 people, because I walked out alive.

For the entire eighteen months from September 1943 to February 1945, I watched as those "patients" were sent into the Hadamar mental asylum, through those double wooden doors. They never appeared again, but new people kept coming.

I was a prisoner of war, confined in a nearby concentration camp with 300 American and Dominican officers. A few hundred yards away, on the opposite side of the valley, was the Hadamar mental asylum, a dark red-walled building painted with red crosses.

Every week, a train arrived in the valley, carrying old and weak men and women. Sometimes there were children. Doctors in white coats and nurses in white hats helped them up the hillside. The wooden doors opened to let them in, and they were never seen again.

We prisoners of war often joked: "There must be six people sleeping in one bed in there now," we always said that every time the train arrived.

One morning, a comrade saw a group of stretcher bearers walking up the mountain from the back of the mental asylum. They walked to the top of the mountain, where they placed a few planks of wood. Then they lifted the stretcher, and we saw something that looked like packages roll down. They removed the planks and hurriedly walked down the mountain.

Thereafter, every day at dawn, we peered out, and what we saw was always the same. Whether it was winter, summer, sunny, rainy, or snowy, those packages were always carried up the mountain and buried in the mass grave.

I talked to the German guards in the camp about this, and he said: "You don't have to worry about it. The Germans humanely killed them and notified their families. You don't have to worry because this is none of your business."

Later, seven months after the US First Army released me, which was a few weeks before this Hadamar case went to trial, I rode in a jeep, walked into that dark building, pushed open the door, and walked inside.

The Smoke of Human Flesh: Emitted from the Gas Chamber

"This is the gas chamber," the director said. It was a small brick room, with broken gas pipes still embedded in the walls. The original entrance had been bricked up, and the room had been cleaned very thoroughly, so there was no trace of the suffering and death of thousands of people here.

Next to the gas chamber was the morgue, which contained two marble tables with faucets, as well as several bottles of chemicals and some surgical instruments.

In addition, we saw some cellars, neatly piled with sweet potatoes. Finally, we arrived at the boiler room. Here, the corpses were cremated on a large scale, leaving no trace. Only two tall chimneys stood on top of the building, carrying the smoke of human flesh into the sky. We walked through the whitewashed corridors, along which were green doors. He opened them one by one with a key, and after I had seen them, he locked them all again. I saw the men's and women's wards, with whitewashed walls and yellow flowers on the wooden tables, very clean. Those patients were listless and seemed very comfortable, at least they were no longer afraid of anything.

But in one ward, a woman cried and banged her head against the door, and a nurse stopped her. From her, we saw an example of all the tragedies in France today. She was frightened into madness by the bombing, and all her children died. She just cried and raved deliriously: "Alas, acute neurasthenia," said the director.

We then walked towards the cellar, down those narrow stone steps. How many people had walked this road to death. When the black iron door opened, a terrifying cold air froze people's hearts and turned their stomachs.

As we walked along the winding road, the director told me his story. His name was Wilhelm Ahrwald, and he was a psychiatrist who had served in several Tibetan hospitals before the war.

40,000 Workers: Buried in Mass Graves

"I retired in 1941," he said, "I was very unhappy that the Nazi Party forced us to use mental patients for experiments. I was worried about these things and became ill, so they allowed me to retire. But in May of this year, the director of the Shanghai Hospital was transferred, and they called me back again. Now, I have to take care of 360 patients, and although I feel very heavy, at least I can do my best to take care of them."

He said that the order to destroy the patients was issued by the Ministry of the Interior in Berlin. A list was often sent with the names of the people to be destroyed circled. They told the doctors here that this was an order from Führer Hitler and that it was forbidden to leak it to the outside world.

But when notifying the families of the deceased, they only said "So-and-so died of illness."

After walking through a few more basements, we returned to the bright ground.

"At first, they used poison gas," said the director, "Then, they experimented with injections. The corpses were not necessarily cremated, sometimes fifteen or twenty were buried together on the top of the mountain. You can often see it."

A window opened, and a head stretched out. I said to him: I want to see the director here. The director was a hunchbacked old man with a bald head. His eyes flashed at me, as if he was a little scared. I asked to visit the hospital, and he said, "Of course!"

On the rows of graves on the top of the mountain, yellow flowers danced in the wind. Each corpse was marked with a number written on a wooden board after burial. The number has now reached around 500.

"There are of course many other people buried in these mass graves," said the director, "but no one knows how many. It is said that 40,000 German, Polish, and Russian workers are buried here, but there are no records and no traces. We are afraid that we will never know if it is true or false."

Next, we went to see the children's cemetery, where only one of the thirteen graves was marked with a name. It was a large wooden cross, and its shadow covered the murdered child.

Child Flees for Life: Chased and Kicked by Nazi Soldiers

I remember one day, I was looking at the hillside opposite from the prisoner of war camp and saw a child begging for his life. It was a summer evening. The child ran out of the red-walled hospital, like a wild animal hiding in an apple orchard. Three men followed behind him, holding guns in their hands, but they did not fire, they just chased him back and forth, as if they were playing hide-and-seek. In the end, the child was caught by them, dragged back, kicked and struggled.

Before leaving that gloomy valley, I went to see the former prisoner of war camp. I saw some American soldiers driving trucks, wandering around in those familiar rooms.

In front of the courtyard, empty wine bottles were piled into a small hill, the barbed wire had been pulled down, and the wooden sentry box was gone. A group of German children were using wooden fences to make bonfires. A child wearing a German military cap saw me walking by and shouted: "Hey, do you have any gum, mister?"

### Kunming Students Should Resume Classes Quickly

The student unrest in Kunming has persisted for over half a month. Chairman Chiang has already issued earnest instructions, the main culprit behind the grenade attack has been brought to justice, and the government's subsequent measures are generally appropriate. Moreover, Governor Lu of Yunnan Province is responsible for mediation, and elders from various circles and leaders of various organizations have repeatedly worked hard to make arrangements for the deceased and provide compensation to their families. It is agreed that the professors of the four schools, including the National Southwestern Associated University, Yunnan University, the English Specialist School, and the Sino-French University, who are highly respected by young students, have also tirelessly persuaded them to resume classes, and they even rang the bell on time the day before yesterday, with everyone going to their classrooms. Based on normal reasoning, the Kunming student unrest should be coming to an end, and after a long suspension of studies, we should be able to hear the sounds of learning again. Unexpectedly, news from Kunming yesterday stated that some students were attending classes in groups of three or five in the morning, but due to the orders of the strike committee in the afternoon, the classrooms were empty again. Furthermore, the professors of Yunnan University advised the students not to lose the sympathy of various parties. Additionally, social organizations in Yunnan Province sent a letter to the student unions of the four schools, stating that because they have repeatedly overturned agreements, they do not seem to represent the public opinion of all students, and therefore they are unwilling to negotiate further. Although the truth of the news from afar is unclear, the fact that Kunming students have not yet resumed classes raises the question of what they are still seeking, which is truly perplexing.

The initial reason for the Kunming students' strike was to "oppose the civil war." In reality, they should first study: What is the definition of "civil war"? What are its causes? What methods should be used to oppose it? Now, disregarding everything else, they directly use the vague slogan of "opposing civil war" as a call to strike, sacrificing their academic time in the process. Whether this is a wise move is already questionable. When the strike dispute led to student casualties, the government's panicked response created complications. Social sympathy and government concern led to the Chairman's instructions, the authorities' punishment of the perpetrators, the professors' persuasion, and the mediation of various sectors. This is all because everyone values education and cares for young people, and absolutely does not want to see these students sacrifice their studies for so long. The students of the four schools in Kunming are mostly close to adulthood, filled with enthusiasm and concern for national affairs. Their aspirations are commendable, and their feelings are understandable. However, if they only know how to stubbornly persist in the strike, using it as their only weapon, then let us ask: Now that the culprits have been punished, and the aftermath can be discussed, what more do the young students want, and why are they happy to waste their time? They must know that the most precious thing in the world is sympathy, and sympathy can be gained or lost, depending entirely on whether one's own behavior is reasonable. It is time for the Kunming students to pull back from the brink! In general, mass movements are often manipulated by a few individuals, who are either the public leaders or the behind-the-scenes strategists. The so-called masses unknowingly become tools for others to play with. Students are rational young people, and they should not willingly become tools. However, in the psychology of the masses, after being swayed by the loud cries of one or two people, they are often driven by emotion or coerced by power, rushing and chasing after each other without realizing it. At this point, reason has long lost its function. The fact that some Kunming students attended classes in the morning but went on strike again in the afternoon makes it easy to imagine the crux of the problem. More than half a month ago, there were rumors that the Kunming student unrest had a hidden agenda, with scheming strategists attempting to create a tragedy through the strike, expand the strike through the tragedy, and then use the strike to affect other sectors and spread to other places, turning the events in Yunnan into a spark that could start a prairie fire. However, looking at the overall situation, is it appropriate for China to have more disturbances at this time? Can we tolerate more sabotage? All problems can be discussed, but not with prejudice and treating each other as enemies. Even if we consider the original intention of the Kunming students, which is nothing more than opposing civil war, the representatives of the Communist Party have fortunately arrived in Chongqing after repeated calls, and the Political Consultative Conference will be opened soon. The government should also be open-minded in discussing and negotiating peacefully. As long as the Communist Party no longer resorts to force, the war can be stopped immediately, so why should students waste their studies? As for the aftermath of the student casualties, the government is determined to handle it properly, and all sectors are willing to negotiate, so the pillars of society will take responsibility, and they will definitely not disappoint the students. Even if the students do not trust the government, do they not trust the leaders of the social organizations and the professors of the schools? We sincerely hope that the Kunming students should resume classes quickly at this time. Only in this way can it be said to be a restoration of rational action, and not purely driven by emotion.

During the War of Resistance, Kunming was a place where universities and colleges gathered in the rear, and a love of freedom was the nature of general young students. The influence of professors and the advocacy of scholars have made Kunming a political center and a focus of factional disputes in recent years. As a result of these激盪, unfortunately, there was a student unrest. Therefore, although the student unrest is a matter for the students, the government and society should bear the responsibility for creating this student unrest, and the young students are actually innocent. However, students cannot rely on their youth to invite the forgiveness of others, and then disregard everything and not ask about the truth, and strike to the end. Since it is called a school, it must teach; since it is called a student, it must attend classes. There is absolutely no school in the world that will be suspended for a long time, and there are no students who will strike permanently. The time for Kunming students to resume classes is now, and it cannot be delayed any longer. The Yunnan University professors said in their letter of advice that they should not allow the foundation of the school to be shaken, and their words are serious and sincere. We deeply hope that the young students will think carefully about it!

### Returning to Calm After the Brilliance - Gold and Banknotes Stabilize - Public Bonds Slightly Decline, Foreign Stocks Sell Well

Yesterday, the Shanghai stock market was calm, with all parties watching and waiting. Trading was limited, and fluctuations were minimal. After opening in the morning, prices hovered around the previous day's closing price. At noon, the market closed slightly higher. It briefly dropped to around 720,000, but was supported by some bargain hunters. In the afternoon, both overnight and spot transactions were very stable. As a result, the market closed slightly lower than the previous day, down 11,000. Gold jewelry was listed at 78,000, and silver remained unchanged at 600 yuan. Silver dollars also remained stable between 440 and 445. Interest rates remained loose, around 6 to 8 cents. The general sentiment is that the current prices of gold and US dollars will not deviate too much from the official exchange rate. After the exchange rate is announced, the market will be even more stagnant. Therefore, there are fewer and fewer active players, and they are shifting their targets. As a result, the trend is not changing much.

Foreign currency, US dollars, also showed sluggishness, initially flat and then weak. In this environment, all parties were unenthusiastic, and there were more closings. In the end, it fell 15 yuan from the previous close. Hong Kong dollars also followed the general trend, continuing to be oversupplied. As a result, old goods fell 10 yuan, and new goods fell 4 yuan. Australian pounds hovered around US$2.5 and Rupees 2.5.

The supply and demand of public bonds gradually reached a balance. Outsiders and cotton yarn merchants were interested, but securities firms and Hakka merchants took profits and left. Since the industry insiders have already closed out their positions, the market gradually shifted from brilliance to flatness. There was a lack of momentum for price increases, and the market was firm but then weakened. Class C bonds broke into the 700 yuan range from a high of 760 yuan. At the close, due to time constraints, Classes A, B, C, D, and E all declined slightly.

Due to the addition of new buyers, Chinese stocks continued to be popular on the market. However, because large players related to the United States and Asia took profits at high prices, buying interest was dampened. Industry insiders saw that the situation was not good, and they closed their positions. As a result, market prices did not advance and retreated. The price of US Asia declined from a high of 430 yuan, and yarn factories declined from 580 yuan. Retail investors on the market also followed suit and sold aggressively. Various small stocks, such as Xinguang from 36.5 yuan, Jingfu 31.5 yuan, and Qinxing 26.5 yuan, gradually became one-sided. In the middle of the session, funds from the bond market entered, and there was a slight recovery, but at the close, they still succumbed to the selling pressure. As a result, large stocks fell about 10 yuan, while small stocks were flat.

Foreign stocks continued to be popular due to absorption by securities firms. The base price was very cheap, and holders were unwilling to sell easily. The trend continued to be popular. The issue of transfer was still the focus of discussion, but it has not been confirmed by the relevant parties. Because the trend was favorable to buyers, sellers hoarded goods and raised prices. As a result, the market showed a buying price. Compared with the previous close, Yisha rose 170 yuan, beer rose 110 yuan, paper rose 40 yuan, and other cereals rose about 10%. However, at noon, due to the sluggish market prices of various industries, the receiving price was slightly lower, and there was gradually a supply of goods.

### Grain Prices Rise - Rice, Flour, and Oil All Increase

Rice shipments were scarce, and the market was firm. White japonica and indica rice both increased by 300 to 400 yuan. White yuan rice was no match for sales, and rose another 500 yuan, and liquidation was active. Flour from the Gang and Yong gangs was still exportable, but the local market was still weak. Prices rose by more than 300 yuan, and the situation was high and sluggish. The oil market was tight, up 500 to 600 yuan. Soybean shipments were balanced, and the market was stable. Raw peanuts continued to increase and were then killed, and bean cakes were flat.

### Yarn and Thread Supply and Demand in Balance

Yesterday, the yarn market remained firm. Customer sales were still active. Local merchants were very active in buying and selling 16-count yarn. A certain cloth factory had a slight interest in 32-count fine yarn. The price of each count of yarn and thread was similar to the previous day. Because the supply and demand of spot goods is temporarily in a state of balance, the price of yarn and thread was stable for a while.

### Cotton Textile Completion of Tax Payment - Application to Improve Methods

Since the establishment of the Commodity Tax Bureau, the completion of tax payment certificates for cotton yarn directly woven into finished products has been limited to packaging (10 pieces per package). However, dyeing and weaving factories and cloth shops in this city all need to transport goods in bulk. Therefore, the bureau has been requested to improve the regulations on the completion of tax payment certificates for the convenience of merchants and civilians.

### Bank Registration - 76 Old Members

(Report from this newspaper) As of now, the Shanghai Banking Association Organizing Committee has registered 76 old members who have obtained licenses from the Ministry of Finance. The Ministry of Finance has approved the establishment of four banks: Overseas Chinese, East Asia, Guangdong, and Central. As for foreign banks that have resumed business, they are also in the process of registering as members.

Also, all commercial banks in this city have decided to close for one day on the 20th of this month to settle interest for all depositors in the second half of the year. Also, the 25th is the anniversary of the Yunnan Uprising, and will also be a holiday.

### White Coal Continues to Rise - Firewood and Charcoal Trends are Weak

White coal dealers are still keen to import, and market prices continue to rise. Although bituminous coal is stable at the original price, sales seem to be stronger than before. However, shipments of firewood and charcoal from various sources have increased sharply, and the trend is weakening.

The American Liberty ship "Blue Star" arrived here from Taiwan yesterday morning, carrying 9,000 tons of coal. Another Liberty ship, "Max Steilai," which went to Qinhuangdao, also arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning, carrying 8,600 tons of coal.

### Tung Oil Exports Launched - 600 Barrels Already Shipped - Another 150 Tons Recently Sold

Since the resumption of foreign trade, three or four tung oil dealers have jointly sold 600 barrels to foreign firms, which were shipped out the day before yesterday. It is heard that another 150 tons have been sold recently, with the price calculated at 31,000 yuan per market dan in legal tender. The foreign exchange is settled by the foreign firm and has nothing to do with the seller. However, most of the oil arriving from eastern Zhejiang is not of sufficient quality. It is difficult to select oil for export, and it can only be sold cheaply for domestic sales at a price of 22,000 yuan per market dan. However, small vendors have disappeared recently, and there are no wholesale purchases in the market.

### A Glimpse of Market Conditions

Commodities have risen due to rumors of adjustments to commodity taxes.

Transactions of raw silk have become more active, and most of the goods are sold to local merchants. Market prices are unchanged.

The prices of raw starch and dried scallops have risen. Persimmon cakes are only used to make "opening stage cakes", and there are few shipments of Geng cakes.

Cigarettes continued to rise in the morning, but profits were taken in the afternoon, and there was a slight pullback. However, compared to the previous close, Yizhong cigarettes were all adjusted upwards.

### Economic Briefs

Since the opening of navigation between Shanghai and Fujian, there has been congestion in Shanghai. It is learned that another two iron barges, Yipuji 155, carrying more than 5,000 bags of flour, more than 300 pieces of cotton, and a total of more than 1,000 tons of miscellaneous goods, are scheduled to be towed to Quanzhou by the Tianxing Wheel tomorrow, and are currently being loaded.

The Chinese Farmers Bank, together with the Jiangsu Provincial Farmers Bank, is actively restoring farmers' loan business and has now drafted regulations, which have been submitted to the head office for approval.

According to rice merchants, the first batch of Siamese rice will arrive in Shanghai within two months, and the quantity is very large, estimated at 4,000 yuan per stone in legal tender.

### Customs Duty Receipts During the Occupation Are Invalid

(Report from this newspaper) After imported goods are taxed according to regulations, they can be transferred to various places, whether in whole or in part. According to regulations, they only need to submit the receipt for verification, and they can be released without hindrance. However, from June 1938 to September 12 of this year, all import duty receipts issued by customs in the occupied areas are invalid. If the goods need to be transferred, they must still pay taxes according to the current tax regulations.

### Enemy and Puppet Purchases of Yarn and Cloth - Dyeing, Weaving, and Yarn Industries - Request Compensation for Damages - Remaining Yarn and Cloth Returned Proportionally

The Shanghai Machine Dyeing and Weaving Industry, Cotton Cloth Industry, and Yarn Industry Associations stated that in August of the 32nd year of the Republic of China, the enemy and puppet authorities ordered the puppet merchants' association and the cotton association to purchase yarn and cloth in the Shanghai area. The control was strict, and no yarn or cloth was left. According to statistics, 61,058 pieces of cotton yarn, 1,079,807 pieces of white cloth, and 4,072,296 pieces of processed cloth were forcibly purchased. Although the price was slightly given at the time, it was actually equivalent to seizure, because it was less than half of the market price at the time. Therefore, merchants suffered heavy losses. Moreover, after the purchase, new production and trade in cotton yarn and cloth were not allowed, and all factories and shops in the city were shut down. Today, after the victory, most of them cannot resume business due to lack of funds. At the beginning of the victory, the heads of the industry associations jointly requested the authorities to order Japan to compensate for the losses. They requested the return of the remaining yarn and cloth that had not been transported by the puppet cotton association, including 13,226 bales of cotton yarn, 146,912 pieces of white cloth, and 2,126,639 pieces of processed cloth, proportionally to the merchants who were forced to sell. In the meantime, in addition to being summoned by the municipal government to instruct representatives to request the Enemy and Puppet Property Administration, there was no effective way. Yesterday, when the central representatives Ye and Niu were in Shanghai, they submitted separate petitions for relief in order to achieve their goals.

### Unified Bonds Exceed Face Value

— Zhao Jun

Recently, unified bonds have been rising steadily, breaking through the 700 mark. The reason is that although it is caused by speculators manipulating and monopolizing, many financial and banking circles have absorbed a lot. According to people from the interior: "Since the National Government moved west, the interest on unified bonds has been suspended since the 31st year of the Republic of China. Although the lottery is still held, the winners have not been repaid. Due to this point, people speculate that the government has the hope of rewarding public bonds.

Also, after the First World War, the German Mark depreciated, but the public bonds issued by the German government were repaid in Gold Marks. At that time, Germany was the defeated party, and they still did so. How much more should our victorious country do so today? From the lessons of the past, the current prosperous situation of public bonds is also expected.

According to the repayment of principal and interest of public bonds, there is a certain amount, which is different from stocks and goods. Occasionally, due to supply and demand, there may be cases where the face value is exceeded, but the number is very small, and there is no huge amount of excess. During the occupation period, the issuance of counterfeit currency was excessive, and there was no credit, so that the market price of public bonds exceeded the face value greatly. This is the difference in currency value, and it is not surprising. After the victory, the principal and interest of public bonds and the daily market price are both valued in legal tender. However, yesterday's market price, Unified A was the smallest, and the closing price was still 380 yuan, and Unified C even reached 700 yuan. Although it is said that people's hearts are with the Han, it is still an inconceivable thing from the perspective of economic normality. Yesterday, I received a letter from Mr. Zhao, explaining why the face value was exceeded so much, which should be the common psychology of general consignees, so it is specifically printed as above. As for whether it is accurate, it can only be verified by future facts. (Reporter)

Education and Sports

### Taiwan's Current Three Needs - The First Need is the Nourishment of the Motherland's Ideology - The Second Need is to Endure Great Hardship and Great Effort - The Third Need is to Correct Japanese-Style Chinese

[Central News Agency Taipei, 17th] A reporter who visited various places in Taiwan for more than 20 days last month wants to specifically mention to the people of the country today that what Taiwan needs most at present are first-class thinkers, educators, philosophers, and scholars.

Try to Suppress

In the past, the Japanese education policy in Taiwan only allowed Taiwanese to develop in medicine and technology, while trying to suppress them in ideology and academics. Therefore, today, these two types of talents have become deformed. If Taiwan's specialists and technical talents can be nourished by ideology and imbued with lofty ideals, they will not only be first-class experts, but also pillars of national construction. If the authorities of the first-class academic circles in the Mainland can organize a Taiwan visiting group at this time to give public lectures and systematic introductions of the motherland's academics over the past 50 years, it will be of great benefit to the education of the Taiwanese people. Secondly, Taiwan currently needs to endure great hardship and great effort. Taiwan has rich resources, but the development of resources cannot make Taiwan the ideal prosperous place without hard work.

Serious Situation

Taiwan has always been known as Japan's warehouse, but at present, there is a serious food problem everywhere, and even sugar production has a problem. The reason is that in addition to the lack of fertilizer sources, Taiwan itself has too much rainfall, the sugarcane planting period is long, and the cost is high, which cannot compete with foreign sugar. It is also a big problem. In the past, the reason why Japan used the power of the state to cultivate Taiwan sugar and prevent foreign sugar from invading the Taiwan sugar market was that Japan did not have sugar in its homeland. Secondly, the reporter wants to mention the writing. The text currently used by the Taiwanese people is mostly Japanese-style Chinese, which is in contrast to the "etc. because of" and "follow this" used by the authorities.

Difficult to Read

The reporter once read a letter from a sugar expert to a senior official, and his opinions on the current contribution of Taiwan were indeed unique, but his Japanese-style Chinese was really difficult to read. There are many Taiwanese who are engaged in the work of teachers. When they perform their duties in the future, they will also feel uncomfortable with the use of official documents and Chinese sentences.

### First Batch of Poor Students - Subsidies Issued

Private Elementary Schools Will Issue in 10 Days

Private Secondary Schools Will Collect on the 21st

[Report from this city] The Municipal Education Bureau has raised a large sum of money for poor students in private elementary schools in this city to subsidize part of their tuition fees. The news has been reported in previous reports. The subsidy method has been approved by the 11th Bureau Affairs Meeting. The number of subsidies for each school is 5% of the total number of students in the urban area and 10% in the rural area, and 1,000 yuan in legal tender for each student. All private elementary schools that have been registered and approved for review can receive subsidies. However, the review is quite complicated and requires an inspection report. If the results of the investigation are satisfactory, the National Education Department will notify the schools in batches by letter to collect the subsidies. Schools that are not very satisfied with the review will be given a grace period, and those whose establishment is revoked or ordered to be suspended will not be able to receive subsidies. Also, in order to speed up the issuance, schools can receive the money first after receiving the notification, and must issue it within 10 days. Then, they must submit the official receipts of each student's parents for the bureau to review. It is heard that the first batch of notification letters has been issued, totaling 93 schools. The remaining schools can wait until they receive the notification before collecting the subsidies.

[Another report] It is heard that the subsidy for poor students in private secondary schools has been decided that the principal must bring the school seal and the principal's personal seal to the Education Bureau on the 21st of this month to collect the subsidies.

### Teachers' Salaries in Nanjing

Minimum Monthly Salary is More Than 17,000 Yuan

[Xinhua News Agency Nanjing] After the municipal government decided to increase the salaries of teachers in primary and secondary schools in Nanjing, the Social Bureau immediately followed up to ensure that teachers could work with peace of mind. Only the salary standards, in addition to the rice allowance that had been determined earlier, the rest, such as the base salary increase and the living allowance, had to be discussed in detail, so the salaries for October could not be issued on time. Now, all the standards have been determined, so all the salaries for October have been reissued. The base salary has been increased by 40 times, the living allowance is 5,000 yuan, and the rice allowance is 3,000 yuan. Assuming that the lowest salary is 50 yuan, according to the above combined calculation, you can get 10,500 yuan. Starting from November, a part of the new standard will be issued first, with the base salary increased to 60 times, the subsidy to 7,000 yuan, and the rice allowance to 6,500 yuan. Therefore, the lowest salary of 60 yuan can get 17,160 yuan per month.

### News from Soochow University

All alumni in Shanghai are welcome to attend with their families.

### Preferential Treatment for Middle School Students Participating in the Anti-Japanese War Military Work Regarding Resumption of Studies and Transfers; The Ministry of Education Specially Formulates Measures and Orders All Provinces and Cities to Comply

[Special dispatch from Chongqing] Many middle school students participated in wartime work. Now that the Anti-Japanese War has been won, they will all return to their original schools. The Ministry of Education has specially formulated measures for the resumption of studies and transfer of students who served in the war in secondary schools, ordering all secondary schools in all provinces and cities to comply with them to show preferential treatment and encouragement. The main points of the measures are excerpted as follows:

Measures for Resumption of Studies

(4) When these students resume their studies, the school may hold an identification examination. Those with particularly excellent grades may be given a discretionary promotion, and those with poorer grades may temporarily attend classes and be given tutoring by the school.

### Charity Basketball Game for Scholarship Funds; Successfully Concluded Last Night; Hua Lian Defeats U.S. Navy Youths; China Youth Team Exhausted and Loses to Guangdong-Western Team; Great Philanthropist Zhang Zhihong Purchases Charity Ball

The Sino-American charity basketball game for scholarship funds, jointly sponsored by this newspaper and Tongde Medical College, was the last two games last night. The program was quite exciting. Fans braved the cold wind to come, and their enthusiasm for helping students is admirable. This newspaper and Tongde Medical College expressed their infinite gratitude to the players for their wonderful performances and the fans for their enthusiastic participation.

Auction of Charity Ball

During halftime of the second game, Mr. Pan Gongzhan presided over the auction of the charity ball, starting at 10,000 yuan. The philanthropists competed to buy it, and the price soared. In a moment, it increased to 80,000 to 90,000, and finally, the great philanthropist Zhang Zhihong bought it for 100,000 yuan. Then, Mr. Pan gave award flags to each participating team.

No Winner

Hua Lian and the U.S. Navy Youths first confronted each other. Referees Jin Botao and Chen Baolin, the U.S. Navy Youths, Xia Mashiyue, Jie Kasiqi, and Hu Zixian scored successively, taking a 4-0 lead. Hua Lian did not panic. Wu Chengzhang, Chen Xuechong, and Li Zhenzhong showed their might, exceeding the U.S. Navy Youths 4-4 in a moment. The U.S. Navy Youths were at a loss. At this time, Hua Lian suddenly changed its lineup. Zhang Liangxiong and Chen Zuoliang came on the field one after another, replacing Kong Guangyi and Li Zhenzhong. The defensive structure loosened, and the U.S. Navy Youths took this opportunity to launch a large-scale attack. Hua Lian seemed out of sync. The first half ended in a 23-23 tie.

Confident

In the second half, Hua Lian reused its most standard lineup. However, the momentum of the U.S. Navy Youths had grown, so the scores rose and fell. 25-27, 29-31, four times equalized. At the height of tension, in fact, Hua Lian had a higher skill, and Li Zhenzhong, Wu Chengzhang, and Bo Tuo took the opportunity to become active, and the scores led gradually. When Hua Lian took the lead with 47-43, Hu Zixian of the U.S. Navy Youths graduated with four fouls, and Aikinsen's appearance had a desperate momentum, forcing a 47-47 tie again. The audience was worried for Hua Lian. The Hua Lian soldiers were confident. Li Zhenzhong showed his power again, scoring three goals in an instant, and finally won the U.S. Navy Youths 55-47.

Steady and Solid

In the second game, China Youth faced Ausina. Referees Qu Honglv and Chen Liang, who had not been seen for a long time, teamed up. The battle began in the opening ball ceremony presided over by Director Gu Yuxiu of the Education Bureau. China Youth used a slow offensive strategy, and Lin Weicong opened the scoring, adding another goal, taking a 4-0 lead. The Ausina team immediately showed its power. Lin Weicong was really good, one throw and one penalty, Xu Meng scored one goal, and China Youth still took the lead with 7-4. Xu Meng of the Ausina team scored again, and the scores gradually caught up. After 7-7, it was exceeded. China Youth proceeded carefully, refusing to relax, and controlled it with a steady and solid method. The Ausina team's Wheeler and Xu Meng were sure to score, causing China Youth to be unable to raise their heads, only trying to follow. In the first half, the Ausina team won with 22-17, and China Youth was only 5 points behind.

Main Player Absent

The game continued after the award ceremony. Ausina became more and more brave. Boba Xu Meng's one-handed basket exploration was unpredictable, taking the lead with 31-19 in an instant. China Youth replaced Liu Fushan with Yao Wenyi, intending to find a way to the basket, but the opponent's defense was very strict, and there was still no progress. On the contrary, the Ausina team's momentum was strong, rushing left and right, invincible. China Youth's attempt to advance quickly was chaotic, so it could not get close. Until the bell rang, Ausina won China Youth with 41-29. China Youth lost its leading role last night due to the absence of the main player Ma Canxi, resulting in a scattered sand-like game, which is a pity.

### High Court Joint Collegiate Bench; Tries the Traitor Chen Riping; Final Arguments Concluded, Sentencing on the 22nd

[Report from this newspaper] The Shanghai High Court specially formed a joint collegiate bench at the Shanghai Prison in Tilanqiao at 2:00 PM yesterday to try the traitor Chen Riping. The presiding judges included Chief Judge Liu Gui, Prosecutor Lin Woming, Judge Zhu Zonghai, Judge Cao Jun, and Secretary Wang Lanping. Prosecutor Lin first announced the main points of the indictment: Chen, a traitor, served as a "Legislative Member" in the puppet organization in May of the 27th year of the Republic of China, and in December of the same year, he served as "Director of the National Treasury" and "Permanent Vice Minister of Finance." In May of the 28th year, he served as a supervisor of the "Huaxing Bank," in August of the 32nd year, he served as "Director of the Economic Department of the First District Public Office of the Shanghai Municipal Government," in May of the 33rd year, he served as a "Consulting Committee Member of Shanghai," and in October of the same year, he served as the former "Deputy President of the News." Chen has served in puppet positions for many years, and his bad deeds are obvious. After clear investigation, he is indicted in accordance with Article 2, Paragraph 1 of the Regulations on the Punishment of Traitors for plotting against the country for the enemy's sake. It is hoped that your court will severely punish him according to law.

Inside the Tilanqiao Shanghai Prison, the High Court's joint collegiate bench publicly tried the traitor Chen Riping yesterday. The lawyers defending the defendant were Qian, Zhang, and Zhao. Except for Zhao, Qian and Zhang arrived in court on time. The one standing in the picture wearing a long coat with his hands clasped is Chen, confessing everything before the presiding judge. The one sitting behind wearing a robe is one of the defense lawyers.

Defendant Confesses to Serving in Puppet Positions

Then, Chen Riping stated the process of serving in puppet positions and being arrested, saying that he was tempted by the Japanese man Ōta Shigeru in the 27th year of the Republic of China. In May of the same year, Shanghai's tabloids suddenly published that the defendant was appointed as a "Legislative Member." Because the environment at that time was harsh, it became true by mistake, and he embarked on the wrong path. Although he served in many puppet positions, he did not collude with the enemy to betray the country, oppress, or defraud. Especially when he served as "Deputy President of the News," he tried his best to promote social welfare undertakings and relief undertakings. As for all expenses, not a penny went into his own pocket. If it can be discovered in the various puppet positions that the defendant did indeed harm the country and oppress the people, he is willing to be executed by shooting.

The Court Interrogates the Arrest Process

The court inquired about the process of his arrest. According to his answer: the defendant lived in Room 57, No. 37 Huanlong Road. On September 15 of this year, because the Englishman wanted to take back the house for his own use, he moved into No. 54 of the same house through the introduction of a Portuguese foreigner. How could he know that the house was occupied by a Korean who had served as an enemy intelligence officer, who suddenly came back. When the defendant was talking to this person, the military police came to arrest the Korean, and the defendant was arrested along with him. Finally, Chen requested the presiding judge to return the residence and unseal the property to maintain the lives of his wife and daughters. Chief Judge Liu asked about the puppet positions, and Chen answered them one by one. The court then presented Chen's pro-enemy thesis on the "Greater East Asia" war, and the medals awarded by the puppet government. Chen was evasive and reluctant to answer.

Serious Crime Suspected, Punishment According to Law

Afterwards, the presiding judge announced the start of the debate. Prosecutor Lin immediately stood up and said that Chen had received advanced education and willingly allowed himself to be used by the enemy. The evidence is conclusive, and when he served as the "Deputy President of the News," he specialized in propaganda for the enemy. According to the crime in Article 2, Paragraph 1 of the Regulations on the Punishment of Traitors, there is no room for sophistry. From the 27th year to the present, the suspicion of being attached to the enemy is very serious. The so-called promotion of welfare undertakings is not enough to reduce the crime he should be punished for, and he should be punished according to law.

Grew Up in Japan, Shallow Understanding

Then, the defendant's lawyer Qian Naiwen stood up to defend, saying that the defendant had been influenced by Japanese education since childhood, and his understanding of the motherland was inevitably shallow. The responsibility lies in the failure of our country's education of overseas Chinese in the past few decades. Moreover, Western European countries often have foreigners born in the country who should accept the obligations of the country of birth. In wartime, the country can only be regarded as the enemy, not as a traitor. Furthermore, the defendant's motive for serving in a puppet position was due to coercion. In addition, the defendant did not commit corruption or pervert the law when he served in the puppet position, and he was very enthusiastic about promoting social welfare undertakings. According to the last clause of Article 3 of the Punishment Regulations, he requested leniency. Lawyer Zhang Yuji also stood up to defend. Finally, Chief Judge Liu announced the end of the debate and scheduled the sentencing for 2:00 PM on the 22nd of this month.

This newspaper's reporter obtained reliable information yesterday that the major traitors currently detained in various special detention centers have been successively escorted to the Tilanqiao temporary detention center. From this, we can know that the small traitors will soon be followed by public trials one by one.

### Foreign Merchants Handling Property Rights Procedures; The Municipal Government Orders a Stop

In the past, due to the concession relationship in this city, foreign merchants and expatriates purchased or leased land from Chinese people. In addition to the permanent lease or deed issued by the Chinese government, they also registered with the consulates of the respective countries. The purpose of this registration procedure was to collect property taxes from the expatriate merchants of the respective countries, that is, the land donations that were called in the past. The Chinese government, subject to treaty relations, no longer collected land taxes or other land donations from foreign merchants and expatriates. Therefore, unscrupulous people competed to transfer land to foreigners, with foreigners attached to the document as proof of the transfer of property rights. After the land was sold, it was not transferred or collected by the Chinese government to evade taxes. Some foreign merchants specialized in buying and selling land, so there were abnormal phenomena such as "registration," "large transfer," and "small transfer," which actually infringed upon China's sovereignty. Now that the concessions have been recovered, they will be corrected. The municipal government has formulated and promulgated the "Provisional Measures for the Shanghai Municipal Land Administration Bureau to Handle Permanent Lease or Deed Land Registration." The Municipal Land Administration Bureau recently found that 14 foreign merchants, including Jardine Matheson & Co., did not understand China's laws and published in newspapers the re-handling of property rights procedures, which hindered the land consolidation plan. Yesterday, it reported to the municipal government to transfer the order to stop. It is reported that the municipal government has ordered the Social Affairs Bureau to transfer the order to each foreign firm to stop this kind of business, and to send a letter to the Special Commissioner of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs stationed in Shanghai to investigate and verify in order to maintain national rights.

### Commander of the American Flying Tigers, General Stone, Returns to the United States

General Stone, commander of the 14th Air Force of the United States (i.e., the Flying Tigers), left Shanghai by special plane yesterday to return to the United States for the Christmas holiday. Stone's visit to China, for the Flying Tigers' amazing contribution to this World War, has come to a temporary end. General Stratemeyer, commander-in-chief of the U.S. Air Force in China, has made a complete announcement about the composition and heroic battle achievements of the 14th Air Force.

### Japanese Prisoners of War Repairing Roads

(Report from this newspaper) Regarding the service of prisoners of war, it has now been decided to repair the Beijing-Hangzhou National Highway, the Shanghai-Hangzhou Highway, and the Shanghai-Songjiang Highway. In addition, the Shanghai-Wusong Railway and the Shanghai-City Center Railway are under construction. Others are raising horses and transporting materials.

### Former Police Bureau Commissioner Sha Li; Escorted to the High Court Yesterday; Confessed Unreservedly to Most Crimes

(Report from this newspaper) Sha Li, the former Commissioner of the Police Department of the French Concession, who specialized in providing intelligence to the enemy and assisting in the arrest of our patriotic elements during the enemy-puppet occupation period, was arrested at his residence by the Shanghai Garrison Headquarters five days ago. After several interrogations, he confessed to most of his crimes. He was escorted by prison car to the Procuratorate of the High Court in Tilanqiao at 5:00 PM yesterday, and will soon be publicly tried. Sha Li is quite burly. Yesterday, he wore a gray herringbone overcoat, with two woolen blankets in his hand, and was escorted into prison.

When the reporter inquired about the truth of the consular jurisdiction dispute when Sha Li, a former police bureau commissioner, was arrested, Mr. Lu, the secretary of the External Affairs Office stationed in Shanghai, replied: Although the Sino-French New Treaty is still under negotiation between the authorities of the two countries, this privilege previously stipulated by the unequal treaty will definitely be abolished.

### Original Owners of Factories Forcibly Sold to the Enemy and Puppets Can Apply for Redemption; Measures for Handling Small Shops Determined

During the Anti-Japanese War, the enemy and puppets forcibly acquired factories. Regarding the handling principle of this property right, the Shanghai District Enemy and Puppet Property Review Committee has passed it and submitted it to the Executive Yuan for approval. All factories sold to the enemy during the war, if the owner can provide

Conclusive Evidence

Proving that the selling price was less than 50% of the market price of the factory building and machinery at that time can be regarded as strong evidence of forced sale. The Review Committee or the Handling Bureau, after finding out the details and whether the original owner colluded with the enemy and puppets, may draft measures and submit them to the Executive Yuan for approval. Those with the lightest circumstances may request the original owner to have the highest priority of purchase based on the assessed price. Also, the handling

Small Shops

The principle has also been decided by the Review Committee, please have the Shanghai Municipal Government issue a return to the original owner, bid for auction, or municipal office according to the nature of the store. (1) If the house is occupied or rented by the enemy and puppet, and its business is not suitable for continued operation, it will be returned to the original owner depending on the situation. (2) If the house is owned by the enemy and puppet, and its business is not suitable for continued operation, together with the production and commodities, the Central Trust Bureau will bid or auction them separately, and the proceeds will be submitted to the special account established by the Handling Bureau in the Zhongxing Bank. (3) If the house is rented and has not expired, and the business is still suitable for operation, the production and commodities in it should be bid or auctioned separately by the Central Trust Bureau, and the proceeds will be handled in accordance with the second item. However, the landlord has the right of first refusal.

More than 100 representatives from Chinese and foreign real estate companies, construction manufacturers, lawyer accountants, and Chinese and foreign reporters attended.

The land property rights of friendly foreign nationals also had many disputes. In order to determine and protect the property rights of Chinese and foreign people, the city's land registration is being held. Three registration offices are now set up at 66 Zhapu Road, 72 Shangwen Road, and 71 Daxi Road to handle land registration matters in Huangpu, Yinxiang, Zhabei, Caohui, Nanshi, and other districts. Property owners can bring their property documents to register. After registration, the Land Administration Bureau will announce it to all sectors of society. If no disputes arise within two months, the property rights of the land will be determined. If the property owner is far away in another place and cannot come to Shanghai to handle the registration procedures for a while, they can apply to this bureau for deferred registration. If the reason is sufficient, it can be approved. Then, the attendees raised various questions related to land registration and property rights, and they were answered one by one.

### Finance Bureau Explains Supplementary Collection of Business Tax

The Shanghai Finance Bureau is currently collecting supplementary business tax for the autumn season. According to an explanation from a person in charge of the Finance Bureau: (1) In order to achieve fairness and reasonableness, supplementary collection is necessary. (2) Regarding the collection of old business tax debts, according to the central government's regulations, the business tax rate was 40 per thousand of the capital amount and 30 per thousand of the turnover.

The Finance Bureau, in order to alleviate the people's difficulties and to achieve fairness and reasonableness between those who have paid and those who have not, is still collecting supplementary tax according to the old rate. (3) Before the war, business tax was a local tax. During the war, it was temporarily assigned to the central government. This city has been following the central government's regulations.

The Shanghai Branch of the National Assembly Representatives Friendship Association held a public banquet yesterday afternoon at the Lido Garden for 葉楚傖 and 鈕永建, two comfort envoys, and invited Committee Member Pan Gongzhan, Secretary-General Hong Lan-you, Supervising Commissioner Cheng Cang-bo, and renowned lawyer Luo Jia-heng to attend. Mr. Ye Chu-cang was unable to attend due to illness, and Mr. Cheng Cang-bo was absent due to other engagements. The remaining guests arrived on time. Over 20 National Assembly representatives attended, including Wu Shao-shu, Wang Xiao-lai, He Yuan-ming, Wu Wen-tian, and Zhou Xue-xiang. Xi Yu-shu was publicly elected to deliver a welcome speech, followed by Mr. Niu Yong-jian, who said, "The Central Government has decided to end the period of political tutelage and immediately implement constitutional government. The implementation of constitutional government must wait for the National Assembly to produce a constitution before civil governance can be implemented according to the constitution. Due to the Japanese invasion and the August 13th Incident, the eight-year War of Resistance delayed the convening of the National Assembly until recently, when the date of convocation was finally determined. Some have criticized the United States' assistance to China as having ulterior motives, but in fact, the United States' assistance to China comes from sincerity and has absolutely no other purposes. Fortunately, the takeover of the Northeast is proceeding smoothly. The Communist Party's disruption can hopefully be quelled due to justice. At the same time, representatives of various parties to the Political Consultative Conference have arrived in Chongqing. In the near future, meetings will surely proceed smoothly." Subsequently, Hong Lan-you, Luo Jia-heng, Ding Zhong-ying, Zhu Feng-wei, and others delivered speeches, and the event ended at 4:00 PM in a joyful atmosphere.

### Development of Post Office Business, Gradual Recovery of Work Efficiency

— Ping Qi

[Reported by this newspaper] Before the victory against Japan, it took at least two days for a local ordinary letter to be delivered in Shanghai. Now, if you mail it in the morning, you can often receive it on the same day.

Wang Yu-guang, a clerk at the Shanghai Postal Administration, told reporters: "We are gradually improving. The development of the post office business is closely related to transportation conditions. Although the post office situation in North and South Ocean areas has not yet returned to normal due to various reasons, letters can still be sent. The personnel who took over the Northeast Post Office once returned to Beiping, but they will soon be able to pass through the pass to perform their duties. Airmail to Europe and the United States currently uses planes of the China-American Aviation Company and occasionally uses the planes of allied countries. Airmail to Europe, the United States and India are sent via Chongqing, and letters to Southeast Asia are sent via Hong Kong."

Overall Plan for Post Office Profits and Losses

After the increase in postage rates, there seemed to be a misunderstanding among the people for a period of time that the increase was too large. Wang Ban-shi said, "Indeed, it seems too expensive to have to pay 20 yuan postage to send a letter from North Sichuan Road to Nanjing Road, but it only costs 20 yuan to send a letter from Shanghai to Xinjiang!" The profits and losses of the post office should be calculated comprehensively based on the situation across the country. At a time when transportation across the country is still quite difficult, even though postage has already increased, it is probably still difficult to make ends meet.

According to reports from this newspaper's Chongqing office, the post office used to lose an average of about 400 million yuan per month. The comparison before and after the price increase is as follows: The income from postage alone in September was 108,008,500 yuan. In October (after the price increase), it was 437,758,900 yuan. The difference is three times. However, the total income in October was 587,136,500 yuan, and the expenditure was 765,137,400 yuan, resulting in a loss of 178,000,900 yuan. In Shanghai alone, there was a surplus of 24,063,800 yuan. The business in November was even more developed, so the surplus was naturally greater.

Collection and Delivery of Parcels in the Yangtze River Basin

Parcels have now resumed collection and delivery in the Yangtze River Basin area. Because many people in Shanghai are anxious to see books and magazines sent from the United States and the United Kingdom, the reporter specifically asked Wang Ban-shi whether such printed materials can currently be mailed. Wang Ban-shi's answer was: "Look!" It turned out that he himself had just received four brand-new copies of "TimesWeek" magazines sent from the United States. However, because the foreign exchange rate has not been announced, it is currently impossible to remit money to foreign bookstores. As soon as the foreign exchange rate is announced, we can order foreign books and newspapers. Before the victory, the enemy puppets took a laissez-faire attitude towards the post office because it was not a profit-making organization. At that time, the post office economy was extremely difficult. Not only was it difficult for employees to maintain their livelihoods, but the more mail there was, the greater the losses became. Now everything has been adjusted, and the 3,000 employees of the entire bureau have received more reasonable treatment. As for some employees who were responsible for organizing the puppet "Postal Workers' Union," they have all been dismissed.

In the past, the post office had many foreign senior officials, but now they have decreased a lot. Their pioneering achievements are worth our gratitude. For example, Mr. Jäpelin, a French national who used to be in Shanghai, put in a lot of effort to protect China's post office. However, he did not have time to see the booming business of the Shanghai Post Office now. He died in Shanghai before our victory.

Spring and Autumn

### Introduction to American Literature and Art

— Zhao Jingshen

The day before yesterday, I took a stroll around Nanjing Road and looked at places like Evans Bookstore and Sino-American Bookstore. All I saw were old books; there were simply no new books. The only publications were local English-language newspapers. Then I went to Dahua Magazine Company, which specializes in magazines, and all that was piled on the tables were old magazines from several years ago. There wasn't even a shadow of a new magazine.

Today, I went to visit the United States Information Office in the Sassoon House, and it was completely different. This is a public library provided for the public to read, introducing the various aspects of American politics, economy, science, literature, crafts, agriculture, etc. to the people of Shanghai. Anyone can go in. When I went, the room was already full of readers sitting at four long tables. The magazines placed on the table next to the gate were mostly about agriculture, medicine, and commerce. Among them were two literary publications, one was "Saturday Review of Literature" and the other was "Theatre Arts Monthly"; the former had about ten copies, and the latter was the August and September issues. The August issue had a long article about the yesterday and today of American "musical comedy". This reminded me of the "Foreign Literary News" that I wrote monthly for "Fiction Monthly" from June 1927 to December 1931. For four and a half years, I never stopped. The materials were all provided by the Commercial Press. Xu Diaofu often brought me a large stack of British and American magazines, including "Saturday Review of Literature" and "Theatre Arts". The latter was also preserved in large numbers in the Fudan University Library. I didn't expect that these two publications could last so long in Shanghai, and they were still being published after fourteen years. Compared to our many short-lived publications, they are truly incomparable! However, "Saturday Review of Literature" used to have correspondence on the literary situation of various countries, but now it doesn't. This is a shortcoming.

There were also many books on the bookshelves. The row of bookshelves in the inner room mostly contained specialized scientific books on engineering, technology, physics and chemistry. The three bookshelves in the outer room, the middle one, mostly contained literary books. As far as I can remember, the following books caught my attention: "American Folklore", which collected many American myths, stories and songs; "American Painting", "American Romantic Painting", and "American Photographic Art" all had lengthy introductions and exquisite illustrations; there were also many collections of plays, such as "Twenty Modern American Plays" (this book has sold about ten editions), "Sixteen Representative American Plays", etc.; there was also a kind of "Patriotic Poems and Essays", mostly wartime literature, but not necessarily purely literary, and there seemed to be many political essays. I wanted to find "Wartime American Literature", which discusses the achievements of American literature during the war, but unfortunately I couldn't find it. There were also many other kinds, such as Whitman's "Leaves of Grass" and Lewis's novel "Arrowsmith".

"Soviet Literature and Art" has already published sixteen issues, and the content is very exciting. Do the colleagues at the United States Information Office, such as Mr. Cao Weifeng, the translator of the complete works of Shakespeare, etc., have the interest to create an "American Literature and Art"? And I hope that our English-speaking literary friends can bring a pencil and some paper to the United States Information Office to translate something, in order to work on communicating Eastern and Western culture; or it would be good to simply browse. Let me add a word of explanation: I am not an employee of the United States Information Office, and they have not entrusted me to promote it. I am just responding in the same voice and automatically introducing it. If you want to know a little about new American literature and art works, please don't forget to go to the United States Information Office!

### Sacrifice [Continuation]

— Luo Hong

The Brevity of History

While talking with Fan Yuqi, Jing Ke listened quietly, his face occasionally turning pale as snow, as if he were pondering something.

"If—" Jing Ke said, but he retracted the words he was about to speak. He looked at Fan Yuqi, then changed his mind, poured wine, and urged everyone to drink, unwilling to continue.

As they drank, they discussed the tense situation. The nation was already facing disaster, and these people, lamenting the times, were filled with intense emotions. Especially Jing Ke, who was eager to serve his country, was exceptionally passionate and generous. He thought of what Tian Guang had just said, of how Prince Dan would use him, and of what Gao Jianli said – that many people thought the strategies of "joining forces" and "horizontal alliances" were no longer effective, and that only boosting morale and serving the country with death remained. He surmised that Prince Dan's intention to heavily rely on him might be precisely to have him serve the country with his death. The only way he could serve his country was by giving his life. The simplest solution, then, was to spill blood within five steps, putting the tyrannical King of Qin to death. However, such an action was not easy. After hearing about the King of Qin's high price for General Fan Yuqi's head, he conceived a plan to meet the King of Qin and carry out the five-step bloodshed. Thinking this, he couldn't help but glance at Fan Yuqi again.

Fan Yuqi, however, stood up slightly, said he had to excuse himself, and walked straight out of the tavern. Jing Ke suddenly seemed to have an idea, and without saying goodbye to Gao Jianli and the butcher, he hurriedly followed him.

"General, we drown our sorrows with wine, and both of us are filled with melancholy. I couldn't bear to part with you so quickly, so I came to accompany you for a walk under the stars."

Fan Yuqi did not expect Jing Ke to catch up, nor did he expect Jing Ke to speak so warmly. Wandering in a foreign land, such sympathy made him particularly excited and moved, and he continued:

"You are so sincere; do you have any insightful views on the current situation?"

"I feel that the situation is so urgent, and the people are being bullied by the King of Qin. We should use the simplest method—" Jing Ke paused here, his eyes fixed on Fan Yuqi.

"May I ask what this method is?"

"I want to die for my country—General Fan, you have suffered humiliation at the hands of the King of Qin, and your parents and clan have been slaughtered. I wonder if you have any ideas?"

Jing Ke saw the painful expression on Fan Yuqi's face, even though he did not immediately answer, which made him shudder.

"Of course, I am willing to sacrifice myself and swear to avenge, to eliminate this tyranny from the world!" He said.

"I want to go alone to see the King of Qin, find an opportunity to assassinate him. That would be the simplest solution, but unfortunately, I am going thousands of miles away and cannot find an excuse to see the King of Qin..." Under the dim starlight, Jing Ke stared intently at Fan Yuqi, his voice unable to continue due to excessive excitement.

He clearly saw Fan Yuqi's whole body shake. He suddenly stopped and muttered, "The King of Qin is offering a high price for my head, so the opportunity for me to help this noble man eliminate tyranny from the world has arrived."

As soon as these words were spoken, Fan Yuqi drew his short sword. Jing Ke saw a flash of cold light, and a head covered in fresh blood fell into his arms. [End]

### "Mama Doctor"

— Zhang Qiqu

Scarlett—the mother of the protagonist in "Gone with the Wind"—was not a doctor, but she would treat the black people. Therefore, her relatives and neighbors admired her, thinking she was very capable, even attributing it to her lineage and family education. In fact, there were many mothers like Scarlett's mother in our previous generation; my mother was one.

My mother's diagnostic talent was perhaps even more advanced than Mrs. Scarlett's. Mrs. Scarlett could only treat women's stomachaches and give black children worm medicine. When she encountered major illnesses like typhoid fever, she was at a loss. My mother, on the other hand, could treat everything from major illnesses like consumption that made famous doctors shake their heads to minor ailments like fish bones stuck in the throat. My sister's spitting blood was cured by her. It hasn't recurred for at least ten years.

She had several "family remedies" that I still remember:

Whenever the children had stomachaches, nine times out of ten it was from eating something bad. Quickly boil a bowl of "hawthorn powder" and take it before going to bed, and they would be cured by dawn. If they felt cold in the summer, it was usually from catching a chill after sweating; one dose of "midday tea" would cure all illnesses.

In terms of surgery, she had a kind of "miraculous medicine water." The method of preparing this medicine water, although said to be "passed down from ancestors," was not a "secret recipe" passed on only to sons and not to sons-in-law. I can publicly introduce it here:

Three coins of realgar and a piece of alum are put in a clay pot, soaked in a pot of boiling water, and placed in the sun at noon on the Dragon Boat Festival to bake fiercely. After noon, it is moved to a shady place. Thereafter, in the summer, whether it was a man, woman, old person, or child, as long as their fingers were red and swollen, or sores grew on their foreheads, she would hold that pot of "fairy water" in her hands, praising the effectiveness of the "external medicine water"; she would gently dip a clean, broken writing brush into it and smear a yellow patch on the red area. Regardless of whether it was effective or not, the cold feeling was quite pleasant. However, we were always a little unhappy when we encountered this kind of situation, especially after going to "foreign schools," we objected even more to my mother's "native methods." We often called her "Mama Doctor" behind her back. The so-called "Mama Doctor" was equivalent to the "Mongolian doctor" in the north and the "Jiangxi quack" in the south, even worse than them, because she had no scientific basis and no famous teacher to teach her; she was simply "doing it blindly." But in fact, she rarely made mistakes. Thinking about it now, her medical knowledge, based entirely on experience, was indeed admirable!

In modern America, because of the perfection of social welfare, there is no longer a need for "Mama Doctors" like Mrs. Scarlett. What about China? Among this generation of mothers, at least very few are as brave as my mother in taking on the role of health consultant for the whole family, both internal and external medicine, which I personally find a little regrettable!

### Orchid

— Lu Danlin

"Orchids are the fragrance of kings," this is an idiom. Indeed, the ancients used orchids as a metaphor for a gentleman who lived independently from the world, hence the saying "orchid in an empty valley."

In my hometown, we planted several pots of orchids in the courtyard, which had been there for more than twenty years. Although there were many other exotic flowers in Fengyuan Garden, I most admired and loved these orchids.

But now, everything seems like a dream. The elegant and fragrant orchids still often make me reminisce and yearn because they have a unique charm. They are not alluring, nor are they charming; they are simply independent, noble, and quiet. Their color and fragrance are otherworldly. They are always draped in light green clothing, with hints of red muscle showing through the thin gauze, smiling to greet people. How lovely is that! They are inherently fraternal; one flower always grows together with four or five sisters, all equally noble, refined, elegant, and delicate, all equally gentle and shy. Their graceful and upright posture is enough to intoxicate and captivate people. Many men of letters in ancient times were captivated, worshiped, and admired them. As for me, although I am not a man of letters, I am also one who particularly worships them.

I was intoxicated by them and always worried about them, as attached to them as to a beloved companion. Leaving them for even half a day or a night always made me feel anxious and uneasy. But since the Japanese pirates extended their devilish claws to my hometown, everything has been devastated. I have no idea what the flowers and trees in my old garden are like, especially whether those few pots of orchids are safe and sound. When it is dry, who waters them? When they bloom, have they been trampled on? Whenever I think about this, I feel as if I have lost a heart. Now that the Japanese pirates have collapsed, I wonder if they can return to normal.

Orchids of my old garden, do you know that your master, thousands of miles away, often thinks about your growth?

### Tang Order - Sending a Friend to the Sea

— Luo Tiaoyu

The room is clean and unpainted, the scent lingers, the eyebrows are too lazy to paint, only poetry and books are loved to the point of obsession, borrowing the elegance of the plum blossom window, the jade table, the ancients as teachers.

Thinking of the north countryside, flying east to mourn the distant sea, reading about the love and hatred, painting tears in the desolate ruins, the images of righteous people.

Pen-tip Chronicles

### The Usefulness of Trouble

— Wu Renzhi

Generally speaking, people are afraid of "trouble," except when fools are energized.

The Chinese seem to have a special intelligence for psychology. Without having to study or conduct many experiments, they can use it flexibly. For example, if someone is stubbornly clinging to your things, then when you ask for them back, they will give you a "trouble" to make you retreat in the face of difficulty. However, this kind of "trouble" must have some power as a basis.

In China, it seems that things, big and small, fall into this formula.

Someone said that I worshiped Europe and America too much, and gave the examples of the American Civil War and the French Revolution as being caused by great "troubles." I said that was politics, and I didn't have time to study the formula for politics. What I, a playwright, care about at the moment is the theater. I wonder: why did the drama theaters that were taken over become movie theaters, while the Peking opera theaters with direct ownership are still performing Peking opera? When I discovered the reason above, I got an answer. It turns out that those who do drama have neither the intelligence to create "trouble" nor any power to rely on. Moreover, there are few fools in the drama circle, and even if there are, they have not yet reached the point of being energized.

The loss of theaters for drama is because some people have made the mistake of "not working for themselves." But this is another answer besides "not working for themselves." However, being afraid of "trouble" is still "for oneself," so it can still be said to be within the reason of "not working for themselves." If the mistake of "not working for themselves" is made greatly, then the usefulness of "trouble" is also great.

Social Service

### Hoping that the Police Authorities Will Eliminate the Shanghai West "Scalper Dens"

— Chang Xiu

The problem of public security is fundamentally a social problem. If public security is handled poorly, society will naturally lose its foundation of consolidation, and the country will naturally find it difficult to embark on the road of national construction and revival. I am appealing loudly here, hoping that the municipal authorities will quickly solve major problems and never relax on minor problems. The order of each district should be handled as quickly as possible. After victory, perhaps there is another difficult hurdle. Our national fortune should not have so many disasters and never see the light. For example, the current Caojiadu Town in western Shanghai is a concentrated area of ​​poor laborers, so there is a mixture of good and bad, which has invisibly become a special area. Although the small traitor and gambling king Zhu Ni Shunlin is dead, his followers, disciples, and adopted children are increasingly rampant, such as extortion, robbery at night, and theft in the morning. They have recently intensified their efforts and secretly and openly opened scalper dens, with extremely clever methods. For example, in the morning, they are located at a certain number in Lishunli, Bailinan Road, and in the afternoon, they are in a certain teahouse near the triangle field of Caojiadu Town, and in the evening, they are at a certain number in Xinkangli, Kangnao Road, or even moving three times at a time. Several platform footers are sent to the vicinity of the shed, all of whom are disguised as small Shanghai merchants to cover up the eyes and ears of outsiders. But every day, I don’t know how many young men and women spend their precious time in it, and I don’t know how much money earned from sweat is wasted. This scalper den, a great demon cave that harms the country and the people, can still exist in the "New West Shanghai" after the light, which is really a "cancer of West Shanghai." I hope that the police authorities will severely punish the leaders of this scalper den and their accomplices and eliminate this great demon cave that harms people. On the other hand, I hope that the compatriots in western Shanghai will rise up to assist the authorities, maintain public security, and strengthen the foundation of social consolidation.

Tuberculosis Prevention Lecture

### On Being Worry-Free About Lung Disease (2)

Chinese Health Association

(4) Regulating and Nourishing is a Palliative Treatment

Lung disease is a chronic tuberculosis disease. Although regulating and nourishing can temporarily be effective, no one can guarantee that the disease has been cured, and no one can guarantee that it will not recur in the future. Stubborn tuberculosis bacteria cannot be completely eliminated by regulating and nourishing. On the contrary, long-term regulating and nourishing provides the bacteria with an excellent opportunity to expand their activities. Once they erupt, they will become a prairie fire and cannot be contained. It will be too late to regret. Therefore, regulating and nourishing is actually a palliative treatment that does not benefit and can cause harm. I hope that general wise patients will not be misled and cause their own troubles.

(5) X-ray Examination is a Necessary Tool for Diagnosis

For all diseases, in order to have correct treatment, there must be correct diagnosis. This principle is recognized by the world. Lung disease is a chronic tuberculosis disease that progresses secretly, and patients are often unaware of it. Therefore, it is especially important to have a correct diagnosis in order to not miss the opportunity for correct treatment and achieve twice the result with half the effort. However, in order to obtain a correct diagnosis of lung disease, it is necessary to perform an X-ray examination. Lung disease is a visceral tuberculosis disease, and without X-ray examination, the crux of the problem cannot be seen. During the incubation period, the disease is not obvious, and it cannot be revealed without this. Therefore, patients with lung disease who want to obtain correct treatment must recognize X-ray examination as a necessary tool for diagnosis and be examined as soon as possible.

(6) Early Diagnosis Yields Twice the Result with Half the Effort

The earlier lung disease is discovered, the faster it will be cured. At this time, the virus has not yet spread to the whole body, and as long as there is correct treatment, the goal of complete cure will be achieved. However, lung disease is very mild in the early stage, and patients are often unaware of it. At this time, only X-ray examination can obtain an early and correct diagnosis. Early diagnosis leads to early treatment, which not only yields twice the result with half the effort and saves medical expenses, but also restores health early and leads to early production, benefiting individuals, families, and even society.
