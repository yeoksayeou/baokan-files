### Thoroughly Maintain Military Discipline and Devote All Efforts to Replenishing Military Preparations: Army Minister Xiao Issues Policy Priorities

Nanjing, 4th (Central News Agency) – The newly appointed Army Minister Xiao Shuyi recently made the following remarks to reporters: "Having been ordered to take up the post of Army Minister, and reflecting on my past service since the return to the capital, including serving as President of the Military Advisory Council and as Educational Director of the Central Army Officer Training Corps, I have fortunately avoided any major mishaps. Going forward, I will continue to uphold the legacy of the late Chairman Wang and work tirelessly under the guidance of Acting Chairman Chen to perfect the art of war. As an ancient Chinese saying goes, those in power should not talk too much. After assuming office, my policy priorities can be broadly divided into four areas: First, to rectify military administration. This point must be strictly enforced, and I hope that officers will closely monitor the discipline of their subordinates and thoroughly maintain military discipline. Second, to implement military education. To build an excellent army, it is necessary to instill excellent education. Military education directly affects the rectification of military discipline, and these two points are what I constantly bear in mind. Third, to replenish military preparations. The replenishment of military preparations has already been undertaken by special commissioners of the Ministry of the Army, and we will continue to strive to replenish military preparations as much as possible. Fourth, to strengthen the personnel of the Ministry. In the future, we will continue to recruit military talent to serve as the cornerstone of the national army."

### Ensuring Security in Jiangxi Province and Promoting the Exchange of Goods: Jiangxi Governor Huang Discusses Policy Guidelines

Nanjing, 4th (Central News Agency) – The newly appointed Governor of Jiangxi Province and Director of the Jiujiang Pacification Office, Huang Ziqiang, met with reporters from the Central News Agency on the morning of the 4th and outlined his key policies for governing Jiangxi as follows:

"I am deeply honored to have received this important appointment from the Central Government to lead Jiangxi and oversee pacification and security matters. I am aware of my limited abilities and fear failure. I will dedicate myself to uphold the spirit of Acting Chairman Chen and Deputy Premier Zhou in working hard and struggling for the welfare of the people, strive to rectify government affairs, pacify the region, and bravely advance on the path of national revival and the defense of East Asia. Jiangxi is close to the front lines. For several years, banditry has not been quelled, and the wounds of war have not healed. Furthermore, finances and transportation are extremely difficult. These are undeniable facts. Today, when discussing governance and construction, we must prioritize and adopt a focused approach: (1) I plan to devote my full energy to improving the quality of officers and soldiers in the army, police, and security forces. Within the limits of available financial resources, I will do my best to improve their treatment and provide rigorous training, so that they can genuinely care for the people and seek their welfare, and gain the trust and support of the people. Only then can the military and civilians work together to achieve security and pacify the region. (2) Jiangxi is located in the central hub of the Yangtze River. In recent years, due to the lack of ships, transportation has been difficult, hindering the smooth exchange of goods with Wuhan in the upstream and Jiangsu and Anhui in the downstream. Within the financial capacity of the provincial government, I will do my best to facilitate shipping traffic between upstream and downstream and strive to develop transportation lines in the southeast, so that the Xiang-Gan, Yue-Gan, and Zhe-Gan routes can gradually become unimpeded. Land can then be fully utilized, and goods can flow freely, achieving the goals of increased production and stabilized livelihoods. (3) Other construction projects, prison work, and resettlement work will also be actively promoted, so as not to disappoint the central government's trust and the local people's expectations. However, I am aware of my limited talent and knowledge, and I hope that domestic talents and local elders will provide guidance so that all tasks can be completed and the goals of pacifying the region, reviving China, and defending East Asia can be realized. This would be fortunate not only for myself."

### B-29 Enemy Aircraft Attack Tokyo in Broad Daylight

Tokyo, 4th (Central News Agency) – The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced at 3:30 PM on the 4th: "From around 8:30 AM to 9:30 AM on the 4th, approximately 150 B-29 aircraft attacked, with Tokyo as their primary target. They indiscriminately bombed from high altitude, causing fires in several parts of the city, which were extinguished by around 10:30 AM."

Tokyo, 4th (Central News Agency) – Observations from various sources suggest that the enemy appears to be adopting a new tactic of surprise attacks to achieve victory. The enemy's painstaking efforts are evident. The characteristics are as follows: (1) Exploiting adverse weather conditions; (2) Attempting the first midday bombing; (3) Using a small number of aircraft to cover their movements, hindering Japanese radar detection. Furthermore, attention is also being paid to the increase in the number of enemy aircraft.

### Japanese Forces on Luzon Island Continue to Fight Vigorously

Luzon Front, 4th (Central News Agency) – Enemy forces repeatedly and stubbornly attacking Japanese strongholds east of Manila have suffered setbacks after being fiercely countered by Japanese forces. However, their fighting spirit seems to remain high, as they continue to reinforce their troops in an attempt to continue the attack. Approximately one division of enemy forces, under the cover of tanks, concentrated their attack near Antipolo since February 26th. Subsequently, after Japanese counterattacks and day-and-night advances, they suffered heavy losses, and their offensive was ultimately thwarted. Enemy forces in the Montalban area, where fierce fighting is ongoing, are currently actively transporting reinforcements, apparently deploying many military vehicles from San Miguel in the north. Another unit of enemy forces is moving south from Calumpang towards Santo Tomas, where Japanese forces are currently engaged in a fierce counterattack. At 9:30 AM on the 1st, enemy forces began landing on Lubang and Ulitico in Nasugbu Bay with over 70 naval transport vessels. Two enemy cruisers, one destroyer, seventeen transport ships, and other small craft are currently patrolling in Manila Bay.

### Japanese Forces Hold Various Strong Fortifications: Fierce Hand-to-Hand Combat Unfolds on Iwo Jima, Enemy Offensive Suffers Major Setbacks

Tokyo, 4th (Central News Agency) – Japanese forces on Iwo Jima have overcome various adverse conditions and are holding Mount Osaka, Mount Tamanawa, and other strong fortifications, inflicting heavy losses on the enemy. The results of the battles on March 1st and 2nd are as follows: 1,700 personnel killed or wounded, thirteen tanks disabled or burned, one flamethrower destroyed, and three aircraft shot down.

Tokyo, 4th (Central News Agency) – Enemy forces on Iwo Jima have recently advanced from the Motoyama area to near the northwestern part of the North Airfield. On the morning of the 3rd, under the cover of intense artillery fire, they launched another attack on the Japanese forces in the northern sector. Japanese units in that area are currently engaged in fierce combat with them. Furthermore, enemy forces have launched several attacks on the Asa area since the 2nd, but have been repelled by Japanese tank units. On the evening of the same day, enemy forces approached Japanese positions with a dozen tanks, and the two armies engaged in hand-to-hand combat. Three enemy tanks were destroyed in this battle, and a large number of infantry were killed or wounded, causing a major setback to the enemy offensive. The fighting in the Mount Osaka area remains extremely fierce, inflicting heavy damage on the approaching enemy. However, the enemy is continuing to increase its forces and is using flamethrowers, making the situation in that area even more critical. Japanese forces are still holding key positions, and their morale is extremely high. Enemy forces in the Nidankama area have also begun to press on Japanese positions, and fierce fighting has broken out since dawn on the 2nd, finally cutting off contact at noon. Enemy forces have also attacked Japanese strongholds in the southern village with several tanks and flamethrowers, but have been repelled each time, and the Japanese forces are still holding their positions. There has been no significant activity by enemy forces in the Mount Tamanawa area, so the front line remains stable.

### War Situation in Various Parts of Greater East Asia This Past Week

Tokyo, 4th (Central News Agency) – The war situation in various parts of Greater East Asia this past week is as follows:

Iwo Jima, Ogasawara Islands

Since the enemy landed on Iwo Jima on February 19th, they have surrounded the island with 20 to 30 large and medium-sized ships and approximately 100 transport ships, subjecting it to naval bombardment of between 7,000 and 8,000 rounds per day. They have also launched air raids from 200 to 800 carrier-based aircraft, and under this air superiority, enemy forces, with tanks and black troops as their vanguard, are conducting a strong and forceful advance. Japanese forces are fighting bravely everywhere. The Japanese forces on Mount Suribachi, having exhausted their ammunition, are still fighting bravely, forcefully breaking through the enemy lines, joining up with the main Japanese force in the north, and launching suicide attacks in various places, attempting to blow up enemy positions, killing and wounding enemy personnel, and inflicting considerable damage on the enemy. As of the end of this week, the enemy has successfully broken through the center of the Japanese first line in the Motoyama area, penetrating Japanese positions and engaging in fierce combat. On the Ogasawara Islands, the enemy continues to launch air raids on other Japanese bases, using carrier-based aircraft by day and large aircraft by night.

Taiwan and the Philippines

The most intense fighting is taking place in the old city district of Manila. The enemy is conducting artillery and bombing raids day and night, and the city has now been reduced to rubble. Four hundred enemy medium and small aircraft from Lingayen and San Fabian have raided Taiwan's central and southern regions in coordination with B-24 and other large aircraft. A recent characteristic is the carpet bombing of non-military facilities by formations of large aircraft, and persistent raids by a small number of aircraft at night. The submarine units in the Mindanao and Celebes Seas are actively disrupting enemy supply lines. On the morning of the 28th, they torpedoed and sank a large enemy transport ship in the Lingayen Gulf, constantly posing a threat to the enemy. In response, the enemy is carrying out landings on small, seemingly uninhabited islands in various places, frantically securing safe routes within the Philippine Islands. At the end of February, enemy special forces landed on the Kure, Sorsogon, and Toboso areas, and fierce fighting is taking place everywhere. A small number of enemy ships have intruded into Manila Bay.

Burma

"Northern Burma Region": The enemy's 1st Army is gradually advancing from the area northeast of Lashio to the south of Se-U, and the enemy's 50th Division is advancing from the area southwest of Namhpatka, 20 kilometers northwest of Lashio. Japanese forces are consolidating their positions in the area around Lashio. Japanese units in the Nanhpaka area are reorganizing their lines north of Lashio in preparation for defending against the enemy's advance. "Momeik Region": Japanese units in the Momeik area annihilated the British-Indian 36th Division near Myitson, north of Momeik, and are pressing on the Seeli River. "Irrawaddy River Region": Enemy units of the British-Indian 5th Division, under the cover of powerful armored units, invaded the area south of Monte, along the Irrawaddy River near Nyangu, southwest of Pauk, on the 27th, in front of Meiktila, a key point south of Monte. Japanese units are bravely engaging the enemy, and fierce fighting is taking place in the surrounding area. Furthermore, Japanese units south of Pauk are pressing and attacking the enemy's East Asia 11th Division on the west bank of the Irrawaddy River since the 20th. "Arakan Region": The enemy's West Africa 81st Division, advancing south from Kyauktaw, invaded the area 10 kilometers north of Tamaanhta on the 21st. The enemy landing south of Maungdaw is increasing its forces. Japanese forces are resolutely counterattacking the enemy on both fronts.

Southwest Islands

On the 1st, enemy carrier-based aircraft from a mobile task force attacked in waves, with 780 aircraft. It appears that the enemy mobile task force is cruising in nearby waters.

### British Imperial Conference to Be Convened at the Beginning of Next Month

### Finnish Government Decides to Declare War on Germany

Stockholm, 4th (Central News Agency) – According to Haitong News Agency: The "Svenska Dagbladet" correspondent in Helsinki reports that the Finnish government has decided to declare war on Germany.

### Soviet Forces on the Eastern Front Prepare to Launch New Offensive

Stockholm, 4th (Central News Agency) – Haitong News Agency reports: Reuters correspondent in Moscow, Hugh Baillie, says that after several weeks of deployment, Marshals Zhukov and Konev of the Soviet Eastern Front are about to begin a major offensive between the Warthe River and the Neisse River.

Berlin, 4th (Central News Agency) – Haitong News Agency reports: The focus of the Eastern Front is still on the northern wing of Stettin. After breaking through near Landsberg and entering Western Pomerania, the Soviet forces are now attempting to advance westward towards Stargard, but their attempts to advance in the past 24 hours have been thwarted.

### Fighting Between the Rhine and Roer Rivers Reaches Its Peak, Street Fighting in Kleve

Berlin, 4th (Central News Agency) – Haitong News Agency reports: The Canadian 1st Army, British 2nd Army, and U.S. 9th Army operating between Goch and Xanten are launching an offensive aimed at cutting off the entire territory on the left bank of the Rhine. The U.S. 9th Army is attacking north and northeast in the Mönchengladbach area. The Canadian 1st Army is pressing towards Xanten, and the British Army is advancing from the bridgehead near Venlo towards Geldern. In the past 24 hours, the Canadian 1st Army has advanced towards the Goch-Xanten railway in the Rees-Waal district. In short, although the battle for the Rhine has not yet begun, the fighting between the Rhine and Roer rivers has reached its peak. In this 1,000-square-kilometer war zone, the battle has been going on for nine days. The British Army is advancing from Venlo towards the Niers River plain and the Kleve-Geldern highway. The river crossing battle is raging fiercely at night. To support the British Army's operations, strong tank units have advanced from the south between Venlo and Düsseldorf to reach the Niers River, attacking Kleve from the south and west. Fierce street fighting has broken out in the southern part of the city. The U.S. 9th Army is approaching Neuss, where the battle for the Rhine River bridge is underway. Further south, the battle for Krefeld is raging. Northeast of Beringen, German forces are resisting the enemy's attempts to deepen their penetration. The Canadian 1st Army, British 2nd Army, and U.S. 1st and 9th Armies are continuing their fierce attacks in the Rhine-Westphalia industrial area, using all available soldiers, tanks, artillery, and fighter planes, but have still failed to cut off the communication between the main German force and the rear and encircle it. The German commander is making good use of strategy, forcing the enemy to pay a heavy price for even the smallest piece of land gained. If the enemy wants to cross the Rhine River and invade Germany's Ruhr region, they must first eliminate the German forces on the west bank of the Rhine.

Editorial

### The Serious Problem of Prices

Amidst the calls for stabilizing prices, the rise in prices since the beginning of the spring seems to be even more fierce than in the previous period. Although the price increases during the Lunar New Year are said to be related to the so-called cyclical increases, this year is even worse than in previous years, which is an abnormal phenomenon that should not have occurred when the authorities are working hard to lower prices. I am afraid that not only will the common people be greatly distressed, but the authorities will also feel very troubled.

The municipal authorities in this city have recently been racking their brains to stabilize prices and have to be said to have done their best. The first urgent thing that the common people expect from the authorities is the drop in prices, at least not to rise wildly like a runaway horse. However, the development of the facts is contrary to the hopes of the authorities and the expectations of the people. It has long been recognized by all parties that without stable people's livelihood, combat power cannot be fully exerted. The seriousness of the price problem and its huge impact has already made needless to mention.

In addition to the basic causes of material shortages and currency inflation, we feel that the following three points are sufficient to further stimulate the rise in general prices, namely:

(1) Unscrupulous merchants do not comply with price limits,

(2) High rice prices,

(3) Rising public utility prices.

Price limits are linked to the black market, as past facts have repeatedly proven, and unfortunately it is happening again today. The recently set price limits for sixteen important items have been increased to take into account the costs and appropriate profits of producers and sellers, which cannot be considered unreasonable. However, as soon as the price limit is raised, the black market will immediately take another step higher. Currently, most of the price-limited items cannot be bought anywhere, even if they can be bought, it takes a lot of effort. The disregard for laws by profiteers and unscrupulous merchants is a factor that destroys price limits. However, on the other hand, there are currently only sixteen newly priced items. Therefore, the price increases of many other important items that are not bound by the new price limits are bound to hit the price limits of price-limited items.

Rice prices are often the leaders of general prices, so we believe that dredging the source of rice and grain, and providing punctual distribution, thereby stabilizing rice prices, is still the most urgent thing to lower prices. If the source of rice and grain cannot be dredged and rice prices still rise without falling, then all so-called price countermeasures will be in vain, and the depth of the crisis hidden here will be difficult to imagine.

Based on past experiences, rising public utility prices are often a major driving force for stimulating general price increases. From March 1st, the city's urban transportation company, the French tram company, and the inland river shipping company announced price increases for tram, bus, and boat tickets, many of which increased by several times. At the same time, China Electric Communications Company also announced that telephone and telegram prices would increase several times from March 1st. China Railway Company announced that from March 5th, train passenger and freight ticket prices and the long-distance bus fares of its affiliated bus lines would all increase, also by several times. The surge of public utility prices by several times will be more than enough to stimulate the rise of general prices. Although public utilities are increasing prices due to huge expenses in order to maintain the operation of the business, which is a last resort, we feel that it is also very necessary for the government authorities to find other ways to provide economic subsidies and various assistance to public utilities in order to avoid stimulating prices too deeply.

In short, the price problem is the problem within the entire economic problem, and piecemeal countermeasures will be difficult to be effective. It is really necessary to make an overall plan from the entire economic policy. We fully understand and sympathize with Mayor Zhou's repeated statement that the municipal government itself has no resources, only "a pair of empty hands," and therefore is "helpless in the face of price increases caused by natural and irresistible reasons." We now sincerely pray that the relevant authorities who are not a pair of empty hands but have the power to mobilize resources will pay more attention to the dangerous phenomena caused by the rampant rise in prices.

### The Chinese Price Problem - Asahi Shimbun February 13 Editorial -

In China, especially in the central China region, prices continue to skyrocket. From the Mid-Autumn Festival in early October of last year until the end of the year, prices have surged three or four times in less than three months. As for the beginning of the Lunar New Year this year, prices have risen even higher, so that the Nationalist government had to resolutely take this measure to limit prices. From this, it is not difficult to imagine the situation of rising prices.

Whether from the point of view of maintaining people's livelihood and stabilizing economic order, or from the point of view of contributing to combat power, countermeasures should not be delayed. The Chinese and Japanese authorities concerned have successively implemented price countermeasures from both material and spiritual aspects, and have strengthened financial controls, restricted the release of speculative funds, thoroughly rooted out unscrupulous merchants, and released recovered materials in order to ensure a large number of agricultural products; but no matter how hard the Chinese and Japanese officials and civilians try, prices continue to rise rapidly, why is this? The issuance of currency must be moderately restrained. Looking at the prices in central China and northern China, they are very different, and the degree of currency issuance is also different in speed. This is enough to prove that the efforts to suppress them are very important.

Because price is the concentrated expression of all political and economic factors, it is imperative to establish a strong countermeasure from the political aspect first. No matter how complete the laws are, if they are not strongly implemented, it will be difficult to expect the situation to improve. Even on the Kuomintang side today, it is difficult to say that corrupt officials have been completely eliminated. In China, the price problem can be said to be a political problem that cannot be solved in the economic field, and this is the reason. We believe that correcting official corruption, making a fresh start, and establishing honest politics are more fundamental than anything else to address the social environment and economic conditions that have caused prices to skyrocket. It is essential to carry out with absolute strength the measures that have already been decided, and this is the key to the Chinese price problem. (Translated by Ji)

### Enemy Assets in Guangdong Transferred to National Government Management; All Enemy Assets in South China Now Transferred

Guangzhou, 4th (Central News Agency dispatch) – Forty-two British and American enemy properties under military control in the Guangzhou and Shantou areas were transferred to the National Government on the 1st. The catalog was handed over to the Guangdong Provincial Government on the 28th. This matter has been announced by the Japanese Embassy Office. Most of the enemy assets transferred this time are churches, schools, and residences located in the former British and American residential areas of Guangzhou. With this transfer, all enemy assets managed by the Japanese military in South China have been completely transferred to the National Government.

### On the Three-Power Conference

The Three-Power Conference of Britain, America, and the Soviet Union concluded with a joint communiqué covering approximately ten items. The initiators of the conference were naturally Roosevelt and Churchill, but these two ill-fated companions had to travel great distances to meet Stalin, which is quite a comical situation. The joint communiqué of the three powers is indeed a military and political document of the anti-Axis powers in the final stage of the European war. However, it is too early to speak of openness and frankness. Currently, with Germany and Japan in a precarious situation, it is natural that the political and strategic approaches of the anti-Axis side must not be confusing and lose their correct judgment. Instead, they must always maintain a calm mind and patiently wait for the opportunity. This is the urgent task before us.

When reviewing the communiqué, it should be viewed from two perspectives. First, the sharp conflict between Britain, America, and the Soviet Union on European policy has the potential to create a fatal rift in the common front of the three powers. It was precisely to avoid this danger that it was deemed necessary to have another Three-Power Conference. Second, although there is open and covert political struggle among the three powers, they have always adhered to the basic position of a joint war. To implement the overall war plan, they have already decided on a common political outline.

The first chapter of the communiqué explicitly addresses the coordination of military actions by the three powers against Germany. This is because Britain and America, embarrassed by the Soviet Union's major offensive, are very afraid of uncoordinated events occurring in the final stage of the war against Germany. The Polish issue, which is generally regarded as the touchstone of whether the three powers are sincerely cooperating, has also come to an end due to concessions by Britain and America. Regarding the solution to the Yugoslav regime, the position of Tito, a communist leader, remains unshaken. Even in dealing with the German question, the focus of European issues, Britain and America, in order to contain the Soviet Union's independent political work, have finally drafted common handling principles for the three powers. The joint declaration on the "liberation" of Europe only extends to the "democratic principles" favored by Britain and America. As for the final decision on the domestic regimes of various European countries after the war, there is no doubt that they will generate profound disputes no less than the Polish issue. All major solutions are based on the strengthening of Soviet political power and the gradual concession of a declining Britain. Thus, the three powers can maintain a temporary balance of power in Europe and maintain cooperation in the anti-German war.

However, this fact does not exaggerate the significance of the joint resolutions of the Three-Power Conference. At least, it can be said that as long as the three powers do not abandon the war against Germany, it can prove that they are still cooperating. Therefore, the three powers' unified strategy against Germany is becoming increasingly dangerous in terms of the war situation. The fact that the three powers are currently putting aside deep-rooted political disputes and seeking to achieve victory in the important stage of the world war is something that our Axis countries will never forget. From the first half to the second half of the war, due to the continuous diplomatic and political efforts of Britain, America, and the Soviet Union, they have repeatedly overcome the crises among the three powers and finally prepared for the overall offensive posture against the Axis powers. Under this situation, how Germany and Japan should deal with such enemies is something that every citizen must keep in mind. (Translated by Lin from the Asahi Shimbun, February 14th).

### News Association and Shanghai Branch Host Ambassador Tsuchida; Guests and Hosts Exchange Cooperative Remarks During the Banquet

The Shanghai branch of the China News Association, in conjunction with Tongguo on Taishan Road, held a joint banquet yesterday afternoon at 6:00 PM in honor of Ambassador Tsuchida. In addition to Ambassador Tsuchida, the guests included Counselor Okazaki from the Embassy, Counselor Sato, Investigator Ikenaga, Information Department Director Matsudaira, Secretary Nakata, Vice Consul Fukuma, and Vice Consul Maeda. The hosts included Li Sihao, Chen Bin Yan, Chen Ri Ping, Xu Liqiu, Jin Xiong Bai, Osako Yoichi, Huang Jing Fen, Lu Feng, Hidaka, and Zhang Zhao Ming.

Chen Bin He's Speech

During the banquet, Chen Bin He rose to deliver a welcome speech, briefly stating: Since the Shanghai News Federation reorganized and established the Shanghai branch of the China News Association, all work has progressed smoothly. Shanghai's newspapers originally occupied an important position in the Chinese news industry. In recent years, although the newspapers have not achieved much in their business, their spirit of cooperation can be described as unprecedented. Now that the war is becoming increasingly serious, the responsibility of our news industry is becoming even greater. We hope that the Allied authorities will provide more guidance and cooperation in the future.

Tsuchida's Reply

Subsequently, Ambassador Tsuchida delivered a reply speech, briefly stating: The leaders of the Shanghai newspapers that constitute the China News Association are not only leaders in the Chinese news industry, but also influential figures in the economic and cultural circles. Therefore, they have made great contributions to all undertakings in Chinese society. Therefore, Japan is willing to do its utmost to assist the development of the Chinese press in all aspects, and hopes that everyone will work even harder. The guests and hosts parted joyfully at around 9:00 PM.

### Reorganization of Central News Agency; First Board Meeting

The Central News Agency, as the only national representative news agency, was born in response to the needs of the environment when the National Government returned to the capital. For five years, under the guidance of former Minister of Propaganda Lin and the dedicated management of successive presidents, it has made its greatest efforts to promote and report on the true meaning of the national construction policy and the Greater East Asia War. At this time, when the final decisive battle stage is approaching and the ideological warfare is becoming increasingly acute, in order to fulfill its important mission, it has been decided to reorganize it into a public interest corporation, to exert its true character as a national representative news agency, and to enlist member newspapers of the China News Association as members, so that they can jointly shoulder the affairs of the agency. All the candidates for the first board of directors and supervisors have been separately nominated by the Propaganda Department and are scheduled to hold their first board meeting in Shanghai today (March 5). After this reorganization, the agency's position will be representative of the nation and its target will be the entire national newspaper industry. With a clear position and a clear target, all parties place the greatest expectations on the agency's future responsibility as a national news agency.

### Changshu District Holds Baojia General Assembly

The Changshu Baojia District of this city held a general assembly of all Baojia yesterday morning at 10:00 AM at the Shanghai Grand Theatre on Daxing Road. Those in attendance included Yu Dengyun, director of the Changshu Branch Bureau, Baojia Wang Renzheng, and more than 1,000 people including the heads of all Lianbao, Bao heads, Jia heads, and Baojia personnel in the district. After Director Gu Jiwu of the Baojia Office gave instructions and the ceremonial rites were performed, Yao Yizhang, the head of the district's General Lianbao, delivered an opening speech, explaining the significance of the meeting. Then, Director Xian was invited to give a speech, the general idea being: The Chinese Baojia system has been widely implemented for thousands of years to govern the local area. After the Northern Expedition, the government tried in many ways to promote the Baojia work. However, the political situation changed repeatedly. It was not until the 18th year of the Republic that it was promoted again. Soon after, incidents occurred again. After the National Government returned to the capital and the concessions were recovered, Shanghai's Baojia work was reorganized. Since its implementation, the results have been obvious. We believe that the Baojia system is the basic foundation for promoting politics and the driving force for people's unity. It is the only organization that can cooperate with the government above and unite outstanding elements and eliminate evil forces below. It has become the main work of the emerging country and will surely represent the pioneer of the great era. However, Baojia personnel should understand their own duties, work diligently and abide by the law, serve the people, sacrifice the small self to seek the big self, and complete the mission of Baojia. Then, Yu Dengyun, director of the Changshu Branch Bureau, and the Baojia director successively gave instructions. Immediately, discussions began on proposals such as household registration, self-defense model training, replacement of residence permits, and Baojia tasks. The results were quite satisfactory. The meeting adjourned at noon.

### Shanghai Market Conditions for Industry and Commerce Last Week: Curbing Market Chaos and Stabilizing Prices

The market conditions for Shanghai's finance, industry, and commerce have gradually stabilized in the past week. This is because the rumors that have been circulating in the past are not credible, people's minds are at ease, and the relevant authorities of the municipal government have thoroughly investigated and apprehended rumor-mongers and detained and punished speculative merchants. After that, the market chaos has been curbed, and prices have fallen instead.

Financial Aspects

The dollar was initially strong, but after Wednesday, it became weak and listless, and the price became stable and flat. The buying trend disappeared, and speculators did not dare to continue to act recklessly due to the strict investigation by the Standing Bureau. However, the bulls were still unwilling to sell, so the gold price in the escort market did not fall, and silver was also plain and colorless. The wave of rising public debt is even more difficult to make a comeback, and Chinese stocks are sluggish, with a decrease in trading volume, which is the most dismal situation in the financial market. Therefore, the general public is not optimistic about the stock market. Credit seems to be tight in the midst of looseness. This is because the silver and money industries have not yet started all business due to the Lunar New Year holiday. Therefore, before industrial and commercial lending is launched, all industries are in urgent need of funds.

Industry and Commerce

The situation in industry and commerce in the past week has also been unremarkable due to the above reasons. Most factories are suspended due to raw materials and electricity. Commercial stores are idle. The increase in the price of various major items is due to the government's policy of suppressing and stabilizing prices, which is being actively implemented by the relevant economic agencies in accordance with the newly limited prices approved recently, which is quite serious. In particular, the low-priced rice of industrial and commercial groups handled by the Municipal Standing Bureau has begun to be distributed in the first phase, and the second phase has been paid, and it will continue to be distributed soon. Therefore, people's food is gradually stable, and the wave of rising rice prices in the black market has also subsided slightly. And it automatically fell from Thursday last week, and the rise in the market price of food and miscellaneous grains also stopped.

Daily Necessities

Vegetable prices have fallen across the board, which should be attributed to the government's efforts to suppress and stabilize prices. The general public expects the authorities to make unremitting efforts to dredge the source, so that after the supply and demand of materials is fully balanced, there will be no more price increases.
