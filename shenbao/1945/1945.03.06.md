### Japanese Troops on Iwo Jima Fight Bravely to Annihilate the Enemy; Fierce Battles Northwest of Mt. Iwo; Two Soldiers Awarded Citations and Announcement Made to the Entire Army

Tokyo, 5th (Central News Agency) – The enemy forces on Iwo Jima, having broken through the island's center from the direction of Motoyama Airfield, attacked the northern airfield on the evening of the 2nd. At this time, the Japanese garrison immediately concentrated artillery fire, launching a fierce barrage and simultaneously attacking from the east, west, and north, causing a large part of the enemy force to collapse. Around 2:00 PM on the 3rd, approximately 600 enemy soldiers advanced to the vicinity of the northern villages. A portion of them, under intense Japanese fire, infiltrated the northern bridge of the northern airfield. By dusk on the 3rd, the main force of the enemy on the western front had reached the western villages between the northern villages and Mt. Osaka.

From Megane Rock to Sankenya, around 11:00 AM on the 4th, the enemy, with over ten tanks and approximately one thousand infantry, attempted to forcefully assault the Japanese position about 700 meters northwest of Sankenya. A bloody battle ensued. Currently, fighting remains intense in the areas of the Aso village north of Mt. Iwo and the Motoyama village. On the morning of the 3rd, Japanese troops in that area ambushed approximately 600 enemy soldiers equipped with four tanks on the eastern side of Aso village, and fiercely attacked the enemy forces approaching the vicinity of Motoyama village, immobilizing one of their tanks and driving them back. On the southern front, around Mt. Iwo, there were no changes on the afternoon of the 2nd. However, by noon on the 3rd, approximately one hundred enemy infantry, under the cover of four tanks, launched a flame attack on the Japanese position, but were immediately repelled. Around 2:00 PM that afternoon, the enemy again attacked the north and northwest of Mt. Iwo with over ten tanks and over eight hundred infantry. Japanese troops in that area are currently engaged in a fierce battle with them.

Tokyo, 5th (Central News Agency) – The Japanese garrison troops in the Mt. Osaka area of Iwo Jima are continuing their brave counterattacks. The gains achieved include two tanks immobilized and destroyed by fire, and 450 enemy soldiers killed. Among them, soldiers Chayen and Kaneko bravely killed over forty enemy soldiers and then urgently cooperated to capture one automatic rifle and three light machine guns, inflicting significant damage on the enemy. The meritorious deeds of these two soldiers were recognized on that day by Commander Kuribayashi, who awarded them letters of appreciation and announced it to the entire army. Furthermore, the Japanese engineer suicide squad, which infiltrated the enemy's geothermal area from the Mt. Osaka area several days ago, had killed or wounded a total of thirty enemy soldiers by the night of the 2nd, and safely returned to the Japanese position on the morning of the 3rd.

### Japanese Aircraft in Large Combined Formations Bomb Enemy Bases in India and Burma; Enemy Advance South Between Nanzin and Sinbo Blocked

Burma Frontline Base, 5th (Central News Agency) – The Japanese Air Force combat-bomber combined formations in Burma launched a large-scale operation before dawn on the 4th, carrying out heavy bombing of enemy forward bases in central and southern Burma and air bases in eastern India. The Japanese Air Force attacked enemy airfields at Shwebo, Thaungdut, Kalemyo, Akyab, Kyaukse, and Cox's Bazar, heavily bombing aircraft parked on the ground, hangars, and other facilities, achieving the following comprehensive results: A. Enemy Damage: (1) 27 or more aircraft destroyed, 15 or more damaged, 1 shot down, totaling 43 or more aircraft. (2) One large explosion. (3) Dozens of cars destroyed or damaged. (4) Further results of destroyed aircraft and ground facilities are unknown due to poor weather. B. Japanese Losses: One aircraft unreturned.

Burma Frontline, 5th (Central News Agency) – The enemy 50th Division advancing southward from the west of Nansan is gradually approaching the vicinity of Nanzin from the north and west. A portion of them is also advancing southward from Sinbo. Powerful Japanese forces in the Nanxiang area are firmly defending the positions in that area and continuing to fiercely attack the enemy forces between Nanzin and Sinbo, thereby blocking their southward advance. The enemy near Meiktila south of Mandalay has, since February 28th, occupied the Ouma and Tatkon airfields, approximately 15 kilometers northeast of the area, with a force of forty tanks and two infantry battalions. On the 2nd of this month, Japanese aircraft formations launched a fierce attack on these airfields, bombing and destroying ground facilities. Japanese troops west of Mandalay have been fiercely attacking approximately 1,300 enemy soldiers equipped with over ten tanks near Nugaung since the 26th, and fierce fighting is ongoing.

Lisbon, 5th (Central News Agency) – The United States has suffered significant sacrifices in the operation to open the China-India transport route and in the construction and maintenance of the highway. According to a Washington dispatch, the State Department issued the following statement on the 4th: "Every mile along the Ledo Road has a cemetery. Currently, sixty-five out of every one hundred participants in this highway mission are black soldiers, who are now struggling against mud, rain, and malaria." This is further evidence that the enemy US is using black people as sacrifices.

### Elite Japanese Troops in Luzon Launch Full-Scale Assault; Japanese Air Force Heavily Attacks Enemy Airfields

Luzon Frontline, 5th (Central News Agency) – The enemy's attempts to break through the Kalabali area are still not to be underestimated. Japanese troops defending the Pengkeng area, 15 kilometers north of San Jose, have been ambushing an enemy division 30 kilometers south of that location since the 27th. Furthermore, Japanese units north of Caranglan are also engaged in combat with approximately 500 enemy soldiers possessing four artillery pieces. The enemy attacking the high ground northeast of Manila is being blocked by fierce Japanese assaults and intense artillery fire. Since the 27th, the enemy's attacks have been stalled. Although enemy shelling has subsided, Japanese soldiers, reinforced by elite units, are in even higher spirits and are carrying out full-scale assaults on the enemy, destroying their preparations for further attacks. Japanese units near Montalban launched a fierce attack on enemy forces entering the vicinity of the Japanese position, inflicting annihilating blows.

Luzon Island Frontline, 5th (Central News Agency) – The Japanese troops in the old city of Manila have had their communication lines cut off since the 26th, but a portion of the Japanese troops is still fiercely resisting. On the 4th, enemy artillery shelling of the city was extremely intense.

Luzon Frontline, 5th (Central News Agency) – From 1:30 PM on the 2nd, Japanese Air Force units heavily attacked the San Fabian enemy airfield for an hour, repeatedly conducting machine gun strafing runs. The results confirmed by Japanese reconnaissance aircraft include over thirty enemy aircraft destroyed and burned, and three locations burned. In addition, significant damage was inflicted on their material and ammunition stockpiles.

Suburban Communication

### Recent Situation in the Southern District of Pudong

— Hee

The southern district of Pudong is located in the eastern part of the city. There is a city ferry service from the Bund No. 13 pier to Dongchang Road in Pudong about every forty minutes, costing 55 yuan per trip. In addition, there are small boats available, also costing the same price, but running more frequently, about every three to five minutes. There are bus routes such as the Shangnan Line, the Dafeng Line, and the Zhoujiadu to Zhoupu Line, which operate on schedule daily, making transportation relatively convenient. The southern district of Pudong governs six towns and twenty villages, which can be roughly divided into three major parts: south, north, and central. The northern part and the area along the river are industrial areas, Dongchang Road in the central part is a commercial area, and the southern part is an agricultural area. The population is approximately 300,000.

Prices Are Comparable to the City

The southern district of Pudong is close to the urban area of Shanghai, so the prices of essential goods are almost exactly the same as in Puxi. The main source of rice is imports from Nanhui, but sometimes when transportation is blocked and the supply is cut off, Puxi rice merchants rush to cross the river to the east to seek high profits when prices rise. The reverse is also true when rice prices are higher in Puxi (as recently as when rice prices in Pudong were 100,000 yuan, while they were only 90,000 yuan in Puxi). However, changes are unpredictable and impossible to grasp or control. Although vegetables are produced in Pudong, they are all contracted out to large wholesalers who transport them in large quantities to the Puxi markets. Therefore, Pudong, the place of production, has to rely on Puxi for wholesale and then transport them back to sell to consumers. Firewood, oil, and other items are mostly transported from Chongming, Qidong, and Jiangbei, but they all go to Puxi first and then are transported here, so the prices are not cheap. The prices of meat and poultry and eggs are the same. Due to the large population, the area is now suffering from overcrowding. Workers and coolies in the factory areas come and go very frequently, leaving almost no vacant land. Most farmers build and live in their own houses, rarely renting them out, so finding a house is even more difficult than in the city. There is the "Imperial Gift Yangdian" temple in Shibajian Town, owned by Taoists. It is not large in scale, but the incense is very prosperous. In previous years, there would be a temple fair every March, with many people from neighboring areas coming to watch. Now it has not been held for a long time, and the grand occasion of the past can only be reminisced about. There is also the Zhang Family Ancestral Hall, which is only barely adequate.

Severe Cold Last Winter Greatly Damaged Vegetables

The main agricultural product of the area is vegetables. Almost all of Shanghai's vegetable needs are supplied by Pudong, from which we can infer the general abundance of its production. All kinds of vegetables are produced here in all seasons. The vegetables currently produced include cabbage, lettuce, spinach, mustard greens, small soup greens, garlic chives, scallions, etc. The total planting area is about 40,000 mu. Last winter, due to particularly severe weather and repeated heavy snowfalls, vegetable crops were greatly damaged. As a result, we rarely see other vegetables in the small vegetable markets except for spinach. The reason why the price of green vegetables rose to be more expensive than meat some time ago was due to natural disasters, not human factors. According to an accurate estimate by someone familiar with the situation, those vegetable growers who work hard all year round lost at least 80,000 yuan of income per mu last winter due to the severe cold weather. This means that the southern district of Pudong alone lost 320 million yuan, which is a huge number. This is not only a loss for the farmers, but also a loss for the region.

Agricultural, Industrial, Commercial, and Educational Situation

In this area, self-cultivating farmers account for the majority, about 80%; tenant farmers are fewer, accounting for only 25%. Therefore, the relationship between farmers is still very harmonious. There are cases of usury, but they are small-scale and not public. Recently, the average interest rate has reached 45% to 50% per month. Land prices vary greatly depending on the prosperity and barrenness of the area, generally ranging from a minimum of 20,000 yuan per mu to a maximum of 700,000 yuan per mu. However, this was a survey from the end of last year, and this year's numbers are naturally much higher. Commerce is most prosperous in Dongchang Road, with a concentration of shops, which is the essence of the area. In terms of education, there is the Municipal Sanlin Middle School, which was very large in scale before the war, and three private middle schools, including Junde and Yangjing. There are fifteen municipal elementary schools and over thirty private elementary schools. Although the number is not small, it is still far from sufficient compared to the total population. School fees are slightly cheaper than in the city, because most of the students in this area are poor children, which is a necessity.

Newly Established Naval Baojia District

In terms of administration, the area is under the jurisdiction of the Pudong Southern District Public Office, which is directly under the municipal government. The current director is Mr. Zhu Yuzhen. In terms of security, the second and third battalions of the security police team are stationed in the area, but they are often transferred, so there is no fixed number. There are also water police and self-defense groups. Finally, it is worth mentioning that on March 1st of this year, a naval baojia district was newly established in the Pudong area along the river.

### Comprehensive Results of Japanese Troops in Shijiazhuang

Shijiazhuang, 5th (Central News Agency) – The local Japanese garrison implemented a mopping-up campaign to cut off the Yan'an Communist bandits in central and southern Hebei Province. The comprehensive results achieved in the year from March 1st of last year to February of this year are as follows: 1,143 engagements, 72,080 enemy soldiers engaged, 4,930 enemy soldiers surrendered, 6,492 prisoners taken, 1,270 enemy facilities destroyed, 6,404 rifles captured, and a large number of other ammunition and military uniforms.

### Central Party Headquarters Holds Memorial Week

Nanjing, 5th (Central News Agency) – The Central Party Headquarters of the Chinese Nationalist Party held its 240th weekly memorial service for the late Premier at 10:00 AM this morning in the main auditorium of the headquarters. Members of the Central Executive Committee and colleagues from various ministries and commissions, as well as over 600 Kuomintang members from government agencies, attended. Secretary-General Chu Minyi presided over the ceremony and gave a speech elaborating in detail on the Premier's theory of "knowing is difficult, doing is easy" and Wang Yangming's theory of "unity of knowledge and action." The meeting adjourned around 11:00 AM.

### Stilwell Discusses Japanese Troops in China

Lisbon, 4th (Central News Agency) – According to a Cleveland dispatch, General Stilwell, commander of US ground forces, spoke at a meeting of arms manufacturers on the 7th, followed by a question-and-answer session with attendees. Regarding the general situation of Japanese troops in mainland China, he replied as follows: "There are a large number of Japanese divisions stationed in China, and the strength of each division is also very superior. In the future, we may encounter the most elite Japanese forces on the Manchurian battlefield."

### Preparatory Committee Established for New Japanese Political Society; Meeting Scheduled for Afternoon of the 8th

Tokyo, 5th (Central News Agency) – The first founding preparatory meeting of the new Japanese political society, originally scheduled for the 7th, has been postponed to 2:00 PM on the 8th at the parliament building due to unforeseen circumstances. The preparatory committee consists of 444 members, including 141 from the House of Peers, 174 from the House of Representatives, and 129 from various sectors. After the meeting on that day, a consultation is planned at Prime Minister Koiso's official residence. The preparatory committee aims to quickly form a political society, weigh party leaders, and formulate declarations, guidelines, and organizational structures, and has decided to first organize a sub-committee. Mr. Kobayashi Seizo, the initiator of the society, sent invitations on the 2nd to approximately 3,000 people, including members of both houses of parliament, those affiliated with the Imperial Rule Assistance Association, and local dignitaries from across the country, requesting their endorsement and cooperation.

### Abundant Japanese Manpower and Material Resources; Time More Advantageous to Japan; Grew Stresses Difficulties of American Warfare

Lisbon, 4th (Central News Agency) – According to a New York dispatch, US Undersecretary of State Grew, speaking at a meeting of the Foreign Press Association in New York on the 1st, called for the thorough defeat of Japan, while also emphasizing the difficulties of the war against Japan as follows: "Since returning from Tokyo three years ago, I have repeatedly conveyed to the public the strength of Japan's military power and the fearsomeness of Japanese soldiers. By today, the American people should have fully recognized what kind of formidable enemy Japan is."

Japanese Army Has Special Beliefs

"The Battle of Tarawa has made the US military understand that the Japanese army is a force with special beliefs. The Battle of Manila has also given the American people the same lesson. The reason why the US military suffered so much damage in the current Battle of Iwo Jima is the result of the Japanese military's tenacious fighting. Today, Japan controls the largest trade routes in East Asia, and this region is in fact an isolated part of the world. Japan has built its country on this region with vast resources. These resources are indispensable conditions for the world economy in peacetime. For example, in the case of natural rubber, Japan's share of production accounts for 94% of the world's total. While the United States is suffering from a shortage of rubber today, Japan still has ample access to valuable rubber. In addition, the production of coconuts accounts for 83% of the total. However, the progress of the anti-Axis war is making it increasingly difficult for the Japanese army to utilize these resources. Although the US military has approached Iwo Jima, the gateway to Japan, only 700 kilometers from Tokyo, the US military and its combat power have not yet reached the point of weakening the Japanese military."

Military Equipment and Supplies Continue to Increase Production

"Japan can continue to increase production of aircraft, tanks, armored vehicles, and other military equipment. Even if the US military blockades south of Taiwan, Japan's important resources such as coal, lead, iron, and food can still be self-sufficient. Japan has abundant electricity and low production costs, and it also has reserves of aviation gasoline, which is most important for long-term warfare. As it stands, the US military supply lines are gradually expanding, while the Japanese are gradually shortening. Japan's population resources are also very abundant. Although Japan has already mobilized millions of troops, there are still millions of able-bodied men who can be mobilized immediately. In addition, Japan adds a large number of new able-bodied men every year. The losses of the Japanese army at the front are less than the number it can replenish. If the United States does not fully understand these facts, it will not be able to grasp the true nature of Japan."

American Ship Captain Greatly Insufficient

"The United States is short of ships in the Pacific War. Although this shortage of ships has existed since the beginning of the war, it will not be resolved in the future. The greatest difficulty in the anti-Axis war is the lack of transport, especially in the Pacific War. This shortage of transport requires three times as many ships for the war against Japan as for the war against Germany, calculated by time and distance. Iwo Jima is just a small dot on the map, but the tonnage of ships mobilized by the US military during the landing was actually more than that used during the landing in northern France. To give an example, the US forces landing on Luzon numbered about 100,000, and the ships required for their supplies were 1.6 million tons in the first 30 days. Even if there is no increase in troops in the future, 600,000 tons of ships will still be needed in the subsequent 30 days. Therefore, two months after the US started landing in Luzon, 2.2 million tons of ships will be needed."

Calling for Offensive Warfare

"There were about 400 enemy naval personnel landing on Iwo Jima, requiring 640,000 tons of ships in the first month and 240,000 tons in the second month, totaling 880,000 tons in two months. Thus, the United States alone is fighting on these two islands, and it is impossible not to mobilize 3.08 million tons of ships in the first 60 days. This figure accounts for 6% of the total 50 million tons of ships owned by the anti-Axis countries. As the speed and difficulty of the Pacific offensive war increase, the amount of ships required also increases. Japan is not only preparing for a ten-year war, but also preparing for a hundred-year war. The most advantageous thing for Japan is time. Japan wants to buy time to utilize the vast resources under its control. In order to break Japan's plan, we must take the offensive simultaneously in the Pacific and Europe."

Ambassador Kurusu's Son Killed in Action

Tokyo, 5th (Central News Agency) – The son of former Ambassador Kurusu, Army Aviation Research Institute Examination Department Technical Captain Kurusu Ryo, took off from a certain base on February 14 when enemy carrier-based aircraft came to Japan. He fought eight giant-type aircraft over Chiba Prefecture, and often shot down one of them, but unfortunately he was hit by enemy bullets. However, he still managed to fly back to the base and report to the captain before succumbing to his injuries and dying in action.

### He Yingqin Arrives in Kunming; Will Go to the Front Line for Inspection

Guangzhou, 5th (Central News Agency) – According to Chongqing Broadcasting: He Yingqin, Commander-in-Chief of the Army in Chongqing, arrived in Kunming on the 2nd with General Mark Clark, Commander of the US Forces in Chongqing. He will go to the front line for inspection.

### US Ambassador to Chongqing Returns to the Country to Report; US Military Commander Accompanies

Lisbon, 5th (Central News Agency) – According to a Washington dispatch: US Ambassador to Chongqing Hurley requested instructions on February 18 to depart from Chongqing to report to the President on the situation in Chongqing, and arrived in Washington on the 4th. At the same time, US Military Commander in Chongqing, General Wedemeyer, also returned to the country. It is conceivable that the mission of the two responsible persons in charge of US diplomatic and military affairs in Chongqing suddenly returning to the country is significant.

### Romania Declares War on Japan

Stockholm, 5th (Central News Agency) – According to Moscow Broadcasting, the Romanian government decided to declare war on Japan on the 2nd.

### Anti-Axis Forces on the Western Front Approach the Rhine River; Attack on Cologne Has Not Yet Succeeded

Berlin, 5th (Central News Agency) – Havas News Agency: US troops are approaching the Rhine River. Cologne, Dusseldorf, Duisburg, and other places are close to the front line. US tanks are preparing to rush to the outskirts, and artillery is shelling the city. British and American forces apparently want to attack the area from Emmerich to Bien on the west bank of the Rhine River. Fierce fighting is taking place between Neuss and Eiffel. German reserve troops attacked the US 9th Corps between Geldern and Kleve, destroying many tanks. Most of the German troops in the rear of the US army in Monchengladbach, Gladbach, Ratingen, etc. have established contact with the German front line. The US attack on the German bridgehead west of Dusseldorf suffered heavy losses. The US attack on Cologne has not yet succeeded.

### Anglo-American War Aims: To Sacrifice Small Countries

Central News Agency Dispatch from Guangzhou: According to reliable sources, the UK and the US frequently use the imminent end of the European war or post-war arrangements as bait to attract smaller nations. But can these smaller nations truly benefit from their favor? These nations are subjugated by the UK, the US, and the Soviet Union’s external security threats and economic oppression, and their political, economic, and social suffering is even deeper than during the last Great War. The UK and the US have repeatedly sacrificed smaller nations to expand their post-war influence. The Atlantic Charter, which they profess to uphold, is also trampled upon by them. This is an old trick of the Anglo-Saxon race and is not surprising. According to Reuters’ Paris correspondent, Hervé, four million Parisians are suffering from hunger and cold. Since the UK and the US invaded France, 600,000 homes have been destroyed, 18,075 miles of railways have been lost, along with 170,000 railway cars and 32,000 automobiles. It will take six years to restore pre-war productivity. The UK and the US only seek to fight Germany, disregarding the lives of the French people, which shows the situation clearly. Furthermore, after Italy’s Badoglio surrendered to the UK and the US, they should have been freed from their shackles. But what is the reality? In terms of politics and diplomacy, Italy has become a battlefield for the UK, the US, and the Soviet Union. In southern Italy, under UK and US occupation, the situation is the same as during the last Great War: unemployment, famine, crime, and prostitution are everywhere. According to Reuters, 95% of infants die due to malnutrition. As for Belgium, the people now long for the happiness of the German occupation era under the so-called liberation by the UK and the US. According to a Lisbon dispatch, the Belgian Foreign Minister flew to London to negotiate with the UK on food issues, but Belgium’s food panic is worsening, and there is no hope for foreign aid. The above are just two or three examples. In addition, the internal strife in Greece, the riots in Bulgaria, the internal conflicts in Poland, and the dismemberment of Czechoslovakia all demonstrate the ambition of the UK and the US. The UK is actively maintaining its old pre-war power, while the US is making every effort to gain a foothold in the European UK, US, and Soviet sphere of influence. The smaller nations in between are all suffering. The US's attempt to land on the Chinese mainland is similar to the situation in various small European countries. The purpose is to sacrifice China and make the people suffer, which is self-evident.

Editorial

### "Public Interest Over Private Interest"

— Chen Binhe

Mayor Zhou once said in a public notice to the citizens: "Public interest is more important than private interest, and society comes before the individual." These two sentences are principles that every citizen should follow, especially Chinese citizens and the citizens of Shanghai in this time of national crisis and social upheaval. However, the general public in Shanghai society still ignores the meaning of these two sentences. For example, regarding the winter relief funds and the donation to the military police, the winter relief has almost ended, and the donation to the military police has already been made, so there is no need to mention them again. Why do we bring them up again today? Because the winter relief funds and the military police donation were apportioned on the spot by the Citizens' Welfare Association on the 7th of last month, inviting various trade associations, and the association and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce jointly urged payment. However, up to now, only a quarter of the amount has been paid by the trade associations, totaling only 10,000,000 yuan over the course of a month. They are still waiting and watching, causing the loans borrowed by the Business Control Committee and various banks to remain unpaid. This very much reflects the Shanghai society’s general attitude of powerful figures ignoring public welfare.

Because most people put private interests before public interests, or even only care about private interests and disregard public interests, the country and society have evolved to such a state of decline and are looked down upon by others. People rush towards profitable things, fearing to be left behind, but everyone avoids public affairs, trying to shirk responsibility. If everyone, especially the powerful figures in society, cannot change this concept, then the collapse of society and the demise of the nation are inevitable.

National affairs are handled under the leadership of national leaders, and the people must obey and cooperate. Social affairs are handled under the leadership of social leaders, and social figures must also obey and cooperate. For example, Mr. Wen Lanting, Chairman of the Shanghai Citizens' Welfare Association, Mr. Li Sihao, Chairman of the Municipal Advisory Committee, Mr. Yuan Ludeng, Chairman of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, and Mr. Lin Kanghou, Secretary-General of the Bankers' Association, are all recognized as social leaders. They always stand at the forefront in leading public welfare, devoting their entire time to serving the public interest. Therefore, we should all obey and cooperate with the matters they lead. This time, they considered the allocation of winter relief funds and military police donations with enthusiasm, so there should be no bargaining after the allocation, and there should be no intentional delays. Otherwise, what is the value of having social leaders? If social affairs are not led by anyone, what will be the consequences?

In the past, whenever Shanghai held social welfare events, the most regrettable phenomenon was that powerful figures generally declined to attend the gatherings for public welfare, and those who were supposed to contribute money evaded responsibility even more, or simply complained about being poor to avoid responsibility. This was especially evident in the recent fundraising for winter relief funds and military police donations. For example, yesterday, at the tea party invited by various leaders for those responsible for unpaid industries, only fewer than 20 people attended out of more than 100 invitees. They all think that as long as their personal businesses are developed and huge profits can be sought, they can close their doors and enjoy themselves, and the words of social leaders can be ignored, and public opinion can be ignored. They have not thought that if the whole society is not peaceful, how can personal safety be guaranteed? If the whole country cannot survive, how can one survive alone?

The economic capacity of the major trade associations in Shanghai is certainly not large in themselves, but there are many wealthy members among the members of the trade associations. If social leaders assign them to bear expenses for social welfare undertakings, the chairman of the trade association should consider the strength of the members, exercise their authority, and distribute the expenses fairly, so there should be no bargaining. For example, the News Association Shanghai Branch was assigned 2,000,000 yuan in the winter relief for the military police donation. I accepted it in my capacity as the chairman of the branch, and paid the full amount within three days. In terms of the units in the newspaper industry, there are only six Chinese newspapers; in terms of economic strength, Xinzhong and other newspapers borrowed money at the end of the lunar year to pay salaries, and other newspapers are even more difficult; however, because it is a social welfare undertaking, we cannot but reluctantly undertake it, because it is an order from the social leader, we cannot but obey. As for the relationship among colleagues, the Zhonghua Daily is our leading newspaper, and in terms of qualifications, Mr. Li Sihao, president of the Xinwen Daily, is our predecessor, but I am the chairman of the branch, so I exercise my authority to allocate expenses, and as long as it is fair and reasonable, there will be no problem. Other trade associations such as banking, money exchange, yarn factories, and flour mills have also paid on time and in full, simply because they value public welfare.

As for those who donate to individuals, I asked Mr. Sheng Youyi for 2,000,000 yuan, and he readily agreed. I also asked Mr. Luo Hongyi, Mr. Zhang Ruitang, and Mr. Xu Changchun for 3,000,000 yuan, and they either donated themselves or raised funds, and they all paid the full amount quickly. For the sake of public welfare, I can be very straightforward in asking people, and they also agreed readily because they value public welfare.

The current situation is becoming more and more urgent, and the undertakings that the country should do and the public welfare that society should do are just beginning to flourish. The winter relief and the military police donation are just a small part of it. Soon, the municipal government will issue 1,500,000,000 yuan in treasury bonds, and the private sector should subscribe to at least 500,000,000 yuan. Those who have businesses, property, and power in Shanghai should actively subscribe. As for the winter relief and the military police donation, those who have been assigned but have not yet paid must pay in full before the 20th of this month. It is hoped that they will value public welfare and pay as soon as possible. Recently, there have been rumors that a giant merchant in a certain industry fled Shanghai to avoid going to a foreign country, but his real estate cannot be moved. I wonder if he will want to come back in the future? Also, the chairman of a certain association was arrested and detained by the authorities for hoarding for personal gain. The former is despised by everyone, and the latter ends up like this. All of this can serve as a warning to those who only care about private interests and disregard public welfare. Be careful!

### Police Department Punishes Illegal Price-Gouging Businesses; Hopes Citizens Will Cooperate and Not Buy Goods on the Black Market

In order to thoroughly suppress prices and stabilize people's livelihoods, the city's economic authorities, through the Price Review Committee, have set new price limits for 16 major commodities. Among them, 11 types were evaluated and announced for implementation in late last month. The Economic Police Fleet of the Fourth Division of the Municipal Police Bureau has directed each squad and price investigation team to conduct thorough investigations in commercial areas and stores throughout the city, and those who exceed the price limit and refuse to sell for various reasons will be investigated. It is reported that the headquarters and each squad seized a total of 41 cases on the 23rd of last month, 35 cases on the 24th, 23 cases on the 25th, 54 cases on the 26th, 86 cases on the 27th, 50 cases on the 28th, 27 cases on March 1st, 75 cases on the 2nd, and 50 cases on the 3rd. A total of 441 cases were seized in nine days, of which most were cases of exceeding the price limit. They have been dealt with in accordance with the law, treating them as first offenders and imposing fines or detention depending on the severity of the case. If they commit the offense again, their business licenses will be revoked, and they will be suspended from business. In addition, the person in charge of the headquarters told reporters that some citizens are willing to pay high prices to buy goods from illegal stores on the black market, which is unreasonable. Therefore, it is hoped that citizens will cooperate with the authorities and take the announced price limit as the standard when purchasing goods. If any illegal store raises prices without authorization, it should be reported to the headquarters.

### The Second Phase of Affordable Rice; Procedures for Collecting Rice Are Being Processed; Distribution Will Begin in Approximately Four Days

The first phase of affordable rice in the city was completely distributed on the 4th of this month. The second phase of affordable rice payment was fully paid on the morning of the 3rd. Currently, the procedures for collecting rice are being processed with the Rice Control Committee, and distribution will begin in approximately four days. The methods and dates for distributing rice will be announced by the Affordable Rice Committee in the near future.

Since its formation, the Zhenxing Women's Ten Table Tennis Team has successively competed with several well-known teams in the city, such as Zhexing, Xinhua, Huaying, Guohua, and Dongfang. Among them, except for the defeat against Huaying, they have won every game. At 3:00 PM yesterday afternoon, they accepted an invitation from the Dalu Bank Table Tennis Team to hold a table tennis friendship match at the bank's hall on Jing'an Temple Road. The Zhenxing team is the only women's table tennis force in the city that has emerged as a dark horse, and the latter is a veteran table tennis force in the city's banking industry. Due to work relations, they have been neglecting practice recently. Yesterday's game ended in a 3-3 draw with the Zhenxing team. After the two teams tied 2-2, the situation was very tense. In the fifth group, Wang Tieli, the main player of Zhenxing, missed her time, and Xu Haili, a new force, played instead. Due to insufficient experience, she lost. In the sixth group's variant match, Lin Jinlan of the Zhenxing team paired with Zhou Ruihua to compete against Ye Jun and Chen Haimen, strong players from Dalu Bank. As a result of the fierce battle, Zhenxing defeated Dalu and announced another victory. The game ended due to time constraints, and the two sides tied 3-3.

Tao Lanying 0—2 Dai Xiqi

### After the Reorganization of the Central News Agency, The First Board Meeting Unanimously Elected Minister Zhao as Chairman

The Ministry of Propaganda of the National Government, considering that the mission of the Central News Agency is becoming increasingly important at this crucial stage of the Greater East Asia War, when the ideological war is becoming even more intense, has specially reorganized the Central News Agency into a public welfare corporate entity. This is to represent the position of the nation and to target the entire domestic newspaper industry, becoming a national news and telegraph agency of the Republic of China. Now that the preparatory procedures have been completed, the first board meeting was held yesterday, the 5th, at 3:00 PM, on the eighth floor of the Cathay Hotel on the Bund, Nanjing Road. Minister Zhao Zunyue of the Propaganda Department personally attended to preside over the meeting. Detailed information is recorded as follows:

Meeting Situation: The first board meeting of the Central News Agency was attended by Minister Zhao of the Propaganda Department, as well as Chen Binhe, Xu Liqiu, Chen Riping, Jin Xiongbo, Yuan Shu (represented by Zheng Jie), Lu Feng, Ju Qingyuan, Jiang Yunzhang, and President Guo Xiufeng, among others. Minister Zhao, as chairman, delivered a speech, reporting on the significance of reorganizing the Central News Agency into a public welfare corporate entity and its future mission (the speech is recorded separately). Subsequently, President Guo Xiufeng reported on the agency's handling of affairs over the past year, elaborating in detail on establishing finances, improving the organization, fostering talent, and strengthening communications. He also expressed hope that after the reorganization of the Central News Agency, it would be able to fulfill its inherent mission as the national news agency, establish closer relationships with various newspapers, and accomplish the mission of the new era. He also stated that since the reorganization of the Central News Agency has yielded results, he hoped to take this opportunity to relinquish his responsibilities. Immediately afterward, the following matters were discussed:

(1) Proposal from the Chairman: Draft of the Central Telegraph Agency's Articles of Association (Resolution: amended and passed).

(2) Proposal from the Chairman: New organizational structure of the Central Telegraph Agency's headquarters and branches (Resolution: amended and passed).

(3) Proposal from the Chairman: Membership fees for the Central Telegraph Agency (Resolution: amended and passed).

(4) Election of the Chairman of the Board (Resolution: Minister Zhao was unanimously elected as Chairman of the Board).

(5) Unanimous recommendation for Guo Xiufeng to continue serving as President. Mr. Guo immediately expressed humility and declined, stating that since the reorganization of the Central News Agency has yielded results, he hoped to take this opportunity to relinquish his responsibilities. Subsequently, it was resolved that the issue of the President of the Central News Agency was of great importance and should be referred to the central authorities for instructions. Chairman Zhao was requested to deliberate and decide after returning to Nanjing, without requiring further resolution by the Board of Directors. Before a suitable candidate is determined, President Guo is requested to temporarily maintain the agency's affairs.

(6) Proposal from the Chairman: Budget estimates of the Central Telegraph Agency's income and expenses from March to June of the 34th year (Resolution: The regular expenses were passed according to the original proposal, and the methods for raising funds will be decided by the Standing Committee of the Board. As for the special budget, it will be raised by the Standing Committee of the Board).

(7) Proposal for reducing personnel and saving expenses (Resolution: To be handled by the President under the direction of the Chairman of the Board). (Other proposals omitted).

The meeting adjourned at 5:30 PM. At 6:30 PM, Minister Zhao specially hosted a banquet for all the attending directors at the Jinmen Hotel. During the banquet, they exchanged opinions on the future development and improvement of the Central News Agency, and the gathering ended happily at 8:30 PM.

Minister Zhao's Speech: Minister Zhao stated: The Central Telegraph Agency is the nation's only news, telegraph, propaganda, and reporting organization. Before the incident, the Central News Agency was established. After the incident, when the National Government returned to the capital, it first merged the China News Agency in Shanghai with the China United News Agency in Nanjing, reorganizing them into the Central Telegraph Agency, making it a national news and telegraph organization. Under the guidance of the former Minister of Propaganda and the management of successive presidents, it shouldered the significant mission of propaganda and reporting for the arduous peace-building movement, making the greatest effort to promote peaceful national policies, propagandize the Greater East Asia War, and correct reactionary propaganda. It has been managed diligently and has a glorious history of five years to date. During this period, although it has experienced setbacks and difficulties due to the development of the situation and the evolution of the times, the Central Telegraph Agency, which bears the important mission of unified national telegraph services and accurate reporting, has always stood tall, struggling arduously to preserve today's achievements.

The news and telegraph industry is not only an important part of the cultural industry but also a major task for completing revolutionary construction and striving for national independence and survival. As the situation progresses to a new stage, the news and telegraph industry also increases its mission accordingly. Especially in the current decisive period of the Greater East Asia War, the ideological war is becoming more intense. In the past, the Central Telegraph Agency was an affiliated business organization under the jurisdiction of this Ministry. Now, in order to strengthen its organization, it has been reorganized into an independent corporate entity, so that it can establish closer ties with the national newspaper industry. On the one hand, it should be clearly aware that its position is the only national news and telegraph organization for the nation, both internally and externally, promoting national policies, releasing political news, and fulfilling the character of a national representative news agency. This is its major task. On the other hand, it is a public welfare corporate body jointly organized by the national newspaper industry, communicating news from various regions and providing telegraph news. This is its sole responsibility. In short, the Central Telegraph Agency's position should be representative of the nation, and the Central Telegraph Agency's target should be the entire domestic newspaper industry. This is the significant meaning of this reorganization of the Central Telegraph Agency. After this reorganization, the Central Telegraph Agency is different in nature from its previous status as a business organization affiliated with the government. However, the government still maintains a guiding position, so that the whole country can jointly seek development to complete the Central Telegraph Agency's new mission for the times.

### A Street Child on Yongshou Street: A Statement After Being Sheltered

This office previously received a letter from Mr. Wu Jingyi, stating that there was a homeless street child on Yongshou Street, who was of good character, did not associate with beggars, and had never begged from people. He hoped that this office and child welfare organizations would extend a helping hand and find a way to shelter him. After contacting the Shanghai Fuyou Orphanage and sending staff to investigate, it was confirmed that he was indeed an orphan who had lost both parents, and he has been sheltered. Now we have received a statement from him after entering the orphanage, excerpted as follows, to clarify the truth:

"I am an unfortunate child. My family originally lived on Nanyang Bridge, and the family's economic situation was still relatively comfortable. At that time, I was studying at the Lagenna Elementary School on Huanghe Road. After the incident, my father lost his job, and prices were rising, making life difficult. Later, my father found a job in Nanjing, so he left Shanghai and moved to Nanjing. My studies were interrupted from then on. I lived in Nanjing for more than a year, but unexpectedly, an accident occurred last June. Because my father's salary was very low and not enough to cover the family's expenses, he tried to bring some capital to Shanghai to do business. Who knew that after arriving in Shanghai, there was no news at all. My mother and I were very anxious, not knowing whether he was alive or dead, so we pawned all the furniture in Nanjing and used the money as travel expenses to rush to Shanghai. Unexpectedly, my father in Shanghai gambled away all the capital he had brought from Nanjing. My mother and I rushed to Shanghai, but he was already penniless, and there was nothing we could do but become homeless. Unexpectedly, misfortunes never come singly. Both my parents contracted dysentery and passed away, leaving me alone, with no relatives to turn to, lonely and helpless. I built a small shack near Yongshou Street and went out every day to collect waste paper and rags to maintain my livelihood. After more than a month, Mr. Wu Jingyi, who runs the Chenjudian wire shop across the street, was very enthusiastic. Seeing that I was pitiful, he asked your newspaper to help introduce me to the Nanshi Dongjiadu Fuyou Orphanage. I get two meals of porridge and one meal of rice a day, and the teachers are very enthusiastic in their guidance. The order and cleanliness are good, and the rules are strict. It is truly a paradise for orphaned children. Therefore, I want to thank your newspaper and Mr. Wu for the introduction. Respectfully, Orphan Shen Shede."

Please Repair the Old Zhabei Bridge

A group of people wrote in a letter: "Since the opening of the Old Zhabei Bridge on Beijing Road in this city on the 12th of this month, pedestrians have been coming and going in an endless stream. However, due to years of disrepair, several places have already been damaged. If you are groping in the dark during an air raid, it is easy to cause danger. Even rickshaws, if they are not careful, may slip and fall. Therefore, we hope that the authorities will repair it as soon as possible for the benefit of pedestrians. We sincerely hope for this."
