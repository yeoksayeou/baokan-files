### Fierce Battles in the Northern Part of Iwo Jima: Japanese Forces Launch Vigorous Counterattacks, Eliminating Over a Thousand Enemy Soldiers in Two Days

Tokyo, 14th (Central News Agency) – American forces on Iwo Jima are focusing their attacks on the northern area held by Japanese troops, engaging in intense battles daily. The enemy employs intense naval artillery, machine-gun fire, flamethrowers, and tanks, causing considerable damage to the Japanese forces. However, the Japanese troops resolutely defend their positions and launch vigorous counterattacks. On the 11th and 12th, the following battle results were confirmed in the vicinity of the northern area: 1,250 enemy soldiers killed or wounded, four tanks disabled, one heavy machine gun captured, fourteen light machine guns captured, sixty-five automatic rifles captured, and a large quantity of ammunition captured.

Tokyo, 14th (Central News Agency) – On the 12th, American forces on Iwo Jima, under the cover of mortar, machine-gun, and aerial bomb attacks, exerted strong pressure on the Japanese positions in the northern area throughout the day. Part of them finally invaded the eastern area of the Japanese position, the eastern plateau of Mt. Ten. However, after fierce fighting by the Japanese garrison, they were stopped. The Japanese forces in that area became slightly more cautious in their attacks but are still striving to strengthen their positions near the 200-meter mark in front of the Japanese positions and are attempting to start an offensive by digging tunnels. On the 13th, the enemy launched a full-scale attack with accompanying tanks under artillery fire. The Japanese forces resolutely defended key points and launched fierce counterattacks against the American forces that were attacking. In this battle, the situation on Mt. Ten, the focal point of the American attack, and the southern front of the northern area position, became deeply entrenched. In addition, a strong unit of Japanese troops, which advanced from the direction of Mt. Tamanayama to the direction of Mt. Osaka on the night of the 8th, continues to fight bravely in the enemy's lines. Extremely fearful of Japanese counterattacks and nighttime hand-to-hand combat, the Americans have deployed countless various incendiary devices 20 to 50 meters in front of their own units, firing blindly regardless of whether there are targets. They also frequently launch flares in front of their sentry lines, striving to discover Japanese hand-to-hand combat teams.

(2) The Kingdom of Eastern Cambodia is an independent nation from this day forward. (3) All the people of the country should recognize this important fact, fully cooperate with Japan to build the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, and strive for the prosperity of Eastern Cambodia.

Restoration of the Southern Zhao Administrative Structure

Saigon, 13th (Central News Agency) – After the elimination of hostile regimes in Indochina, the Japanese commander's public announcement mentioned that "no changes will be made to the local government, existing laws and regulations will be respected, and the French political organization will be continued." Therefore, the Governor-General's Office remains as the highest central administrative organ. The post of "Governor-General" is currently vacant as Decoux has been detained. The commander of the Japanese forces currently serves as the highest person in charge of Indochina. Ambassador Matsumoto will serve as the highest advisor to Indochina to manage the affairs of the Chief Secretary. Under him are the existing departments and bureaus. In addition, Ambassador Yokoyama serves as the highest advisor to the Empire of Annam, which declared independence on the 11th, and Consul General Kubo serves as the highest advisor to the Kingdom of Eastern Cambodia. Furthermore, the Japanese advisor to the Kingdom of Luang Prabang within the former protectorate of Laos has not yet been determined. Under the Japanese advisors, the administration of independent countries will continue in the same manner as before for the existing residents. Consul General Arata will serve as the governor of the former directly governed colony of Cochinchina, Consul General Katsuta will serve as the Director-General of the former protectorate of Tonkin, Consul General Dinh Thon will serve as the advisor to the Empire of Annam, and the Consul Generals of Saigon-Cholon and Hanoi, as well as the proxy mayors, have also been decided. As for police administration, the commander of the Kasuga Military Police will concurrently serve as the Superintendent-General of Police. Apart from this important position, the remaining positions will continue to be held by local residents.

### Close Relationship Between Japan and Thailand

Bangkok, 14th (Central News Agency) – The head of the information department of the Japanese Embassy in Bangkok made the following remarks at a joint meeting of Japanese and Thai journalists on the 12th: I would like to advise the Thai people that the relationship between Japan and Thailand is very different from the relationship between Japan and Vietnam. The formation of the Japan-Thailand relationship is a treaty of offensive and defensive alliance, which is different in name and fundamentally different in essence. The Japan-Thailand alliance treaty is based on common ideals and beliefs and is a unity of mind. Therefore, the amity between the two countries will not be affected by any changes in the war situation. This can be clearly understood from the past three years of the Japan-Thailand relationship. For example, regarding Japan-Thailand cooperation negotiations, both sides can smoothly promote them no matter how difficult they may be. Vietnam's attitude is always based on its own interests and lacks a consistent spirit. With the evolution of the war situation, especially since the landing of the Axis forces in Europe, its tendencies have become increasingly obvious, not only secretly communicating with the enemy but also failing to fulfill its responsibility for joint defense, thereby becoming a major threat to the defense of East Asia. I believe that the Thai people can fully understand Japan's actions this time. Based on the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration, the Japanese government has done its best to help Annam and other ethnic groups achieve independence. Thailand's independence is becoming more secure as the hostile countries on its borders collapse. At the same time, Japan is promoting the exchange of goods between Thailand and Vietnam, which can now be gradually realized. This will have a multiplier effect on alleviating the economic life of the Thai people.

### Japanese Ministry of Home Affairs Announces: Change of President of the East Asia Development Company

Tokyo, 14th (Central News Agency) – Mr. Komanosuke Sasaki, the President of the East Asia Development Company, resigned from his position because he was recently appointed as a member of the House of Peers by imperial command. The Ministry of Home Affairs has decided to promote the Vice President, Ryuichi Ikebe, to the position of President and to appoint the former Vice Minister of Finance, Hideo Matsukane, as Vice President.

Editorial

### Breaking Established Rules

In extraordinary times, all actions and measures should have extraordinary deployments and extraordinary means in order to adapt to the needs of the extraordinary period. This is not only absolutely necessary in the military field but also in general politics, economy, and even social undertakings. This is where peacetime differs from extraordinary times. The content of so-called extraordinary deployments and extraordinary means does not follow peacetime procedures or peacetime methods of operation but is completely based on speed and decisiveness, resorting to shortcuts if necessary to achieve the goal. In simple terms, everything in extraordinary times needs to break peacetime rules in order to achieve extraordinary goals.

Taking political institutions and political efficiency as an example, in extraordinary times, simplification must be implemented. Redundant institutions must be cut back, and the processing of documents must also be simplified to reduce the habit of mutual restrictions and delays. Secondly, the prescribed office hours must also be broken. While being punctual during the prescribed working hours, working hours must also be extended outside of the prescribed working hours to finish today's work today. At the same time, each department must take responsibility for a task and handle it quickly. The peacetime habits of procrastination, evasion, restriction, and delay must be swept away in extraordinary times. Only in this way can a wartime system be established and the political effectiveness of extraordinary times be brought into play.

Furthermore, in terms of economic efficiency, a controlled economy is a policy that must be adopted in extraordinary times. During the process of control, it must be strict and swift, fully grasping controlled materials. At the same time, the purpose of control is not to hoard or monopolize materials but to supply military use and allocate civilian needs. Therefore, the allocation process must also be strict and swift to benefit both military and civilian needs. The control and allocation institutions must divide their labor and cooperate with each other. If the control institution cannot grasp controlled materials and cannot strictly and swiftly implement control, it will never be able to fulfill its control mission. If the allocation institution has no materials to allocate, it is merely an allocation in name only. Control is control, and allocation is not allocation, which is not the purpose of a controlled economy policy in extraordinary times.

Looking at countries around the world that have taken extraordinary measures in extraordinary times and achieved results, for example, Allied Japan has made many extraordinary achievements in the military field. What it can boast to the world most is the special attack unit of the army and navy and the Kamikaze attack unit. Their members are not military experts who are well-versed in military strategy or tactics. In terms of official rank, they are almost all lieutenants, second lieutenants, and even corporals. In terms of age, the oldest is no more than thirty years old, and the youngest is under twenty years old. However, they have become the heroes most praised by the people. This is a concrete manifestation of extraordinary action in extraordinary times. Secondly, when the Soviet Union was severely oppressed by the German army at the beginning of the German-Soviet War, most of the city of Stalin was lost, Leningrad was besieged, and Moscow was about to fall. The Soviet army was able to regain its strength and regain its advantage. The biggest reason for its success lies in the continuous promotion of new talents and young cadres, while decisively dismissing senior leaders who had been meritorious in the past but now lacked the ability to adapt to current needs. This is also the effect of extraordinary measures to promote new talents in extraordinary times.

There is a common saying in the Chinese officialdom called "Xiao Gui Cao Sui," which is a routine saying after a successor takes over from his predecessor. A good saying is humility, and a bad saying is blind obedience. In these extraordinary times, one must constantly seek progress and cannot have conservative ideas. Recently, the Governor of Jiangsu Province, Ren, came to Shanghai on official business. Yesterday, he made a statement on the recent situation of Jiangsu's provincial administration. However, he did not say the usual officialdom remarks. He said, "To be honest, I don't sing high-sounding tunes... Everyone works according to their duties, without exaggeration or falsehood." This proves that Ren has the determination to break established rules. We cannot help but have a new expectation for the future of Jiangsu's provincial administration.

### Enemy Planes Raiding Osaka: Over Thirty Aircraft Shot Down: General Headquarters Announces Interception Results

Tokyo, 14th (Central News Agency) – The Japanese General Headquarters announced at 4:30 PM on the 14th: From midnight on the 13th to dawn on the 14th, when enemy planes raided the Osaka area, the results obtained after our interception were as follows: (1) Eleven shot down; (2) Twenty damaged.

As a result, several places in the city suffered damage, but by 9:30 AM on the 14th, most of the fires had been extinguished.

### Vice Minister Chen of the Ministry of Finance Discusses: General Outline of This Year's Administration: Will Issue Public Bonds to Balance the Budget

Nanjing, 14th (Central News Agency) – Vice Minister Chen Zhishuo of the Ministry of Finance met with Chinese and foreign reporters at 4:00 PM yesterday to report on the recent administrative situation of the ministry as follows: The organizations directly under the ministry include the Customs Administration, the Salt Administration, and the Tax Administration. The administrative situation of each of these administrations this year is:

(1) "Customs Administration" – Regarding customs administration, the superintendents of the Guangdong Customs and the Jianghai Customs were successively abolished. Regarding the current status of customs revenue, the customs duties in China and South China that were turned over to the national treasury in the 33rd year of the Republic amounted to more than 280 million national currency, and the amount in North China amounted to more than 31 million Lian Yin currency.

(2) "Salt Administration" – Due to transportation difficulties caused by the incident, tax revenue has sharply decreased. The Ministry of Finance is currently devising methods to solve the transportation problem.

(3) "Tax Administration" – Currently, tax revenue accounts for the first place in national tax revenue, the largest of which is the cigarette tax. The registered prices and tax rates for the cigarette tax have been increased since March 1st of this year. The tax rate in the 33rd year of the Republic was 55%, which was changed to 65% from March 1st of this year, an increase of 10%. However, according to the current situation, due to the lack of raw materials and electricity conservation, it may be difficult for the cigarette tax to reach the budget figures.

(4) "Matters Concerning the Ministry"

Taxes – The first point is that taxes in all provinces and cities can be uniformly implemented in accordance with the central government's adjustment regulations. There are still a few places where exorbitant taxes and miscellaneous levies exist. The Ministry is currently paying attention to adjustment. In addition, there are transit taxes and incense and candle taxes. The transit tax adopted a commissioned system in the 33rd year of the Republic, which was entrusted to the China-Japan joint venture transportation company to handle. The results varied. The Ministry of Finance is working hard to make adjustments, which have made considerable progress, currently reaching more than 40 million yuan. The incense and candle tax is a tax that was recently implemented. The collection of the incense and candle tax is handled by the General Administration. However, the Shanghai market is entrusted to the same industry association to handle it on behalf of the Ministry of Finance. The three provinces and one city directly collect the tax, collecting about 13 million yuan per month. In addition, there is a tin foil tax, which can now collect more than 3 million yuan per month. In addition, regarding the collection of commodities by local governments, the Ministry approves its implementation within the possible scope according to the actual situation of the locality. Several places have already begun to implement it, and the results are not bad. However, the collection of commodities is limited to rice and wheat.

Currency Department – The work of the Currency Department is to manage financial institutions. Currently, there are still new banks and money houses being established in various places. Therefore, the outside world is quite confused. The Ministry has carefully considered the matter beforehand and approved it according to the needs of the actual situation. It was indeed more lenient at the beginning, but now it is absolutely strict. In addition, efforts are being made to strengthen special financial institutions such as the insurance industry. Recently, an office for inspecting the insurance industry has been set up under the Central Reserve Bank to implement preliminary inspections. As for the amendment of the Insurance Law, the Ministry is currently drafting it. In addition, the Exchange Supervision Committee is now under the sole management of the Ministry of Finance and has established an office for exchange supervisors. Unsound stocks will never be allowed to be listed. The transaction tax has increased by nearly 4 million yuan per month.

Accounting – The total national budget for the first half of the 34th year of the Republic is 360 million yuan per month, but the actual income and expenditure cannot be balanced. The overdraft is about 40 million yuan. In order to balance income and expenditure and make up for the overdraft, the Ministry of Finance has decided to issue a type of domestic public bond in the 34th year of the Republic. As for the budget objects, ensuring public security is the most important, accounting for more than 60% of the total budget. The next priority is to increase production, followed by improving treatment.

Public Bonds and National Treasury – Regarding public bonds, it has been decided to issue domestic public bonds this year. The maximum limit for this public bond is 200 million yuan, and the amount for half a year is 100 million yuan. In addition, the second phase of the construction public bond of 30 million yuan will continue to be issued. As for the national treasury, it should be able to meet the payments until recently. Regarding the special consumption tax, the collection of the special consumption tax was originally handled directly by the Ministry of Finance. From January 1st of this year, the work of collecting the special consumption tax was entrusted to the local governments of various provinces and cities, and it was stipulated that half of the tax revenue should be turned over to the central government, while the remaining half should be used to subsidize local administrative expenses. Since its implementation, except for Beijing, which has already turned over the tax revenue, other provinces and cities have not yet turned it over. Therefore, it is not yet known what the results are. However, judging from Beijing, it is better than before. As for the tax rate, it is still the original 4%. Shanghai, due to the huge expenditure on administrative expenses, the central government has approved it to add a surcharge as a subsidy for Shanghai's administrative expenses.

### Japanese Forces in Zamboanga Bravely Inflict Damage on the Enemy

Philippines Front, 14th (Central News Agency) – Under the cover of fierce shelling towards Zamboanga, the enemy is currently accumulating strong medicines and other supplies near the wharf airport and is attacking the Japanese positions with a strong tank force as the vanguard on the northern end of the airfield line outside the city. Upon learning this, the Japanese side inflicted damage on the enemy tank force with powerful shelling and also caused the enemy's supply depot to burn, causing the enemy forces to be in a state of chaos. Furthermore, they launched a brave surprise attack at night. Since the enemy landed until the 11th, they have killed or wounded approximately 300 enemy soldiers.

### Notes on the Allocation of Dongting Mountain (2)

— Yifei

Population and Farmland: Dongshan is divided into four towns and six townships, with more than 9,000 households in sixteen bao and a population of more than 35,000 people. Currently, there are about 5,000 mu of farmland. Most of them are small owner-cultivators with two or three mu of land. Those with more than 100 mu of land are extremely rare. Of these 5,000 mu, mulberry fields account for almost one-third, and the rest are rice fields. Previously, "highlands" along the eastern side of Taihu Lake were originally planted with late rice, but due to the damage caused by rice stem borers, the losses were huge. Now, 70% or 80% of the land has been converted to early rice.

If a tenant farmer is a new household, they must pay a deposit rent of 10 yuan per mu. Old households are exempt. Last year, the rent for rice fields was one shi of unhusked rice, worth 3,000 yuan, and the rent for mulberry fields was 100 yuan per mu. If the tenant farmers pay the rent within the agreed time, the landlord will give a 10% discount out of consideration for the tenant farmers. As for the rental price for this year, it will only be known in October during the rental period. Furthermore, if tenant farmers here fail to pay the rent on time, the landlord can take back their farmland. Currently, the land price in Dongshan is about 45,000 yuan per mu, and the land price in the downtown area of the town is about 70,000 yuan per mu.

The area of Xishan is twice that of Dongshan, so there is also more farmland, about 22,000 mu. The entire mountain is divided into two towns and eight townships: Donghu Town, Xiaoxia Town, Litang, Huili, Zhenxia, Hanzhi, Lucun, Qixian, Qianwan, and eight townships, with a population of about 30,000 people. Donghu Town is the most prosperous place in the entire mountain, and it also has the largest population, about 4,000 people. Litang Township has the largest area and larger houses. As for Xiaoxia Town, it is the place where the King of Wu took refuge. In addition to many scenic spots, there are many fish ponds along the lake. The entire Qian is divided into Dongcai, Xicai, and Qinjabao forts, with a population of more than 10,000 people. Xishan has a large area and a sparse population. Most of the men in the villages are engaged in fishing, and most of the women are engaged in hard labor. As for the work of transplanting rice seedlings and planting rice every year, it is all done by men.

The land tax for both Dongshan and Xishan is 22 jin of grain per mu. According to the regulations, the official stipulation is to collect commodities in kind. However, in reality, the chiefs of each township only collect cash from farmers at market prices, and then buy grain with the money and hand it over to the county government. In addition to this amount, the "Dongshan Land Tax Collection Office" also has to collect a 10% handling fee. According to the reporter's investigation, since the land tax was levied last year, only one-tenth of the expected total amount has been collected to date, which is due to the failure to establish public security in the area.

In addition, the local self-governing organizations have a method of collecting household subsidy fees from the people to run local public undertakings. Currently, each household pays about 300 to 2,000 yuan, and the poor are exempt.

Firewood, Rice, Medicine: Dongting Mountain, on the surface, is no less than a peach blossom paradise in a chaotic world, but after a little research, the internal crisis is extremely large. Here are a few things to illustrate:

(1) Rice is the staple food of the people of Dongting Mountain. About 250 dan of rice are consumed every day. However, the local farmland is limited, and the rice produced is only enough to supply one month's needs. Therefore, the source of rice is all dependent on Xujing, Henan (belonging to Zhejiang), Mudu, Changxing and other places, especially Changxing. If the source is interrupted, panic will arise immediately. On the day the reporter arrived, the price of rice was originally 32,000 yuan, but due to the influence of the price of rice in Suzhou (about 50,000 yuan), many people in Dongshan secretly transported rice to Suzhou, resulting in a surge in the local price of rice, creating a phenomenon of having a market but no rice. On March 7, the villagers in Houshan Township could not buy rice and were in a state of panic. Fortunately, there was a foreign rice boat in the village. The boat owner went to the front mountain to inquire about the market price and refused to sell it immediately. The villagers gathered by the boat and forced them to open the warehouse and land, otherwise they would sink the boat with huge rocks. The rice merchant finally surrendered, but it was a drop in the bucket and did not help. If rice boats do not come here in the future, the food supply of Dongting Mountain will become a problem. On the day the reporter left the mountain, the rice panic increased rather than decreased, and the price of rice also rose to 46,000 yuan. (To be continued)

Nanjing, 14th (Central News Agency dispatch) - Representatives from all sectors of the capital held a wartime current affairs discussion meeting at the Sino-Japanese Cultural Association on the 11th of this month, deciding to suggest that the people's representatives of all circles in the capital should organize a wartime people's representative conference for all provinces and cities. It is heard that the conference will be held in the capital on a regular basis. Regarding the government's view of this conference, Minister Zhao of the Propaganda Department made the following statement: Considering that the war has entered a decisive stage, the people of all circles in the capital believe that the people of the whole country should rise up in a timely manner to contribute to the grand plan.

The people are the foundation of the nation, and the nation's duty is to protect the people, in order to increase the well-being of the people. The people's duty is to defend the nation, in order to strengthen the country. Now that the Greater East Asia War has reached a decisive stage, it is a critical moment for the rise and fall of our country. The people of the whole country, feeling the importance of national obligations, have resolutely risen up and gathered representatives from all over the country in the capital to discuss wartime issues. Their patriotism is truly sympathetic. The people's representatives from all over the country are all leaders in various fields, with long-standing experience in various work departments. Now, from the perspective of the people, they are gathering ideas and pooling efforts to come up with good strategies to suggest to the government for adoption. They will surely make many contributions to the work of revitalizing China and defending East Asia. The government especially hopes that the representatives participating in the conference will fully express the will of the people, as a reference for dealing with wartime issues. Therefore, it is also very much looking forward to the gains of the conference.

### China Railway Formulates Measures to Crack Down on Unscrupulous Employees; Approved for Implementation by the Ministry of Construction

Nanjing, 14th (Central News Agency dispatch) - In view of the fact that a small number of unscrupulous employees of the Central China Railway Company frequently engage in improper behavior, the Ministry of Construction ordered the company in January of this year to formulate measures to crack down on illegal acts by employees. After the Ministry of Construction approved the implementation of the measures, the measures are recorded as follows:

Article 1: In view of the fact that company employees' customer service attitude during passengers' travels is often criticized, these measures are specially formulated to eliminate criticism and achieve a clear travel purpose.

Article 2: All employees of the company, whether or not they directly contact passengers, must have a white cloth tag sewn on the left breast of their uniform with their service location, number, and name.

Article 3: Company employees shall not accept bribes from passengers or cargo owners for any reason.

Article 4: If it is found that employees who directly contact passengers use the excuse of checking passenger tickets to threaten and extort money from passengers, they will be disciplined and dismissed.

Article 5: Employees who directly contact passengers should conduct themselves in a serious and impartial manner. If passengers are found to have irregularities, they should be handled in accordance with railway regulations. However, if passengers commit irregularities due to not understanding the actual situation and without malicious intent, they should be strongly guided to get back on the right track. In the event of any of the foregoing incidents, forced abuse or bribery for private handling is not allowed.

Article 6: When passengers request to consign luggage in accordance with proper procedures, baggage handlers should promptly accept and handle it, and shall not engage in improper acts such as forcing money, deliberately making things difficult, or deliberately damaging luggage.

Article 7: Anyone who is not directly in contact with passengers, or who impersonates an employee, and extorts money from passengers in the station or on the train, may be arrested and extradited to the authorities, requesting severe punishment.

Article 8: The stationmaster must pay attention to the baggage handling fees charged by redcaps at all times, and seriously supervise their extortion and smuggling of controlled goods.

If any improper behavior is discovered, investigate the facts severely, and if the case is serious, send it to the police for severe punishment, or dismiss the employee; if the case is minor, impose disciplinary action or reduce salary. Those who are dismissed due to misconduct will have their qualification to work for Central China Railway revoked.

Article 10: Stationmasters and conductors should pay close attention to cracking down on unscrupulous employees in the station and on the train, striving to achieve the purpose of safe and smooth travel, and maintain close contact with relevant government agencies to eliminate unscrupulous employees.

### Changes in Lending Policy of Local Banks and Money Shops; Significant Meaning for Eradicating Speculation

Recently, major banks and money shops in the city have made many new changes in the operation of their lending business. It is understood that mortgage loans for movable property, immovable property, controlled goods, daily necessities, and legitimate commodities have been rejected. The reason for the rejection is that the term is too long, the funds are affected by stagnation, and it is difficult to use them actively. Therefore, they are now trying to accept short-term bill discounting and special interbank lending and other lending businesses, which have a very short term, high profits, and are most suitable for the conditions of funds being active at any time. The amount of funds used is also dispersed in many aspects, and it is relatively easy to recover and release. As for borrowers, if the amount is small, the interest and handling fees are also low; if the amount is large, the interest and handling fees are proportionally higher, which makes it difficult for customers to bear. It is heard that this move has significant meaning for eradicating speculation and hoarding and suppressing prices.

### Police Bureau to Issue Retirement Pay Today; All to be Issued Within the Week

The Municipal Police Bureau will issue retirement pay of two to six months to those who have been eliminated in the recent personnel cuts. It has ordered each branch and team to report a list of the eliminated personnel.

### Governor Ren of Jiangsu Arrives in Shanghai to Discuss the General Situation of Jiangsu Provincial Administration; Six Organizations in the City Hold Tea Party Today to Welcome Him

Since taking office, Ren Yuandao, Governor of Jiangsu Province, has made many contributions to the construction of Jiangsu's provincial administration. Ren recently arrived in Shanghai on official business. The Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the Municipal Administration Advisory Committee, the Citizens Welfare Association, the Shanghai Branch of the China Press Association, the Charitable Corps, and the Suzhou Association of Fellow Townsmen in Shanghai, in order to express their welcome to Ren, will hold a welcome tea party this afternoon (15th). The following is a record of Ren's speech on the Jiangsu provincial administration:

"I was specially appointed by the National Government on November 10 last year to take over the position of Governor of Jiangsu Province and Director of the Pacification of Jiangsu. It has been four months since I took office. I have long wanted to come to Shanghai to meet with leaders and old friends from all sides. However, due to the complexity of miscellaneous affairs, I have not been able to fulfill my wishes as soon as possible. I am deeply ashamed of being taken care of by all walks of life.

Jiangsu Province is adjacent to Shanghai, located in the heart of the Yangtze River Delta, with beautiful mountains and rivers, and was originally known as the granary. After the return to the capital, the National Government authorities and the general compatriots also have the most ardent expectations for all reconstruction. Since the first implementation of Qingxiang in the summer of the 30th year of the Republic of China, all facilities and improvements have attracted the attention of both China and foreign countries. I have only been in office for a short time, and I am ashamed to say that I have no achievements to speak of. Now I would like to briefly report on the general provincial administration that is sufficient for you to hear:

(1) Public Security and Production

Since Qingxiang, thanks to the cooperation of the National Army stationed in the province, local teams, and allied forces, the suppression of bandits has been very effective, so the public security situation in the province can be said to be good. I was ordered to also take charge of pacification, and I immediately actively sought to improve the treatment of the military and police under my jurisdiction, enrich preparations, strengthen training, improve quality, and pay special attention to the correction of military discipline. At the same time, I deployed joint defense in various counties, rectified the people's Baojia self-defense, and created a spirit and system of unity between the military and the people. The activities of bad elements have been eradicated, so that we can devote all our efforts to increasing production from the establishment of public security. Regarding increased production, this province currently has jurisdiction over 23 counties in Jiangnan. Last year, the output of rice was about 25,183,892 piculs, wheat was about 5,084,560 piculs, and other miscellaneous grains and soybeans, etc., were all harvested in large quantities. There was a slight increase compared to the previous year. In addition to providing purchases for the Rice Unification Council, there is still no need to worry about the food supply for the people of this province.

(2) Finance and Taxation

It is generally said that Jiangsu Province is a rich area, and its finances are better than other places, but in fact, with the amount of income and expenditure being huge, it is always difficult. However, what can be pointed out responsibly is: (1) The implementation of in-kind collection of land tax has increased the provincial treasury revenue by more than 500% compared to the previous year. (2) The budget for the first half of this year in the province will reach 800,000,000,000 yuan, all on the condition that the burden on the people is not increased, and balance is sought. (3) Completely eliminate the accumulated malpractices in tax collection, and cancel the so-called positive and negative ratio evils for tax包稅 people. Those who steal and evade taxes will be investigated and dealt with seriously according to the law. For example, the amount of consumption special tax increased four times more than the previous year after the department handed it over to the province. (4) The Jiangsu Local Bank, which acts as the provincial treasury, always ensures that the amount of deposits reaches 10,000,000,000 yuan. It actively promotes the operation of foreign trade in the province and the promotion of industry and commerce in the province. And in order to meet the needs of increased production, it is willing to make its best efforts for rural loans. Economic and financial management is gradually on the right track, which can be gratifying to you.

(3) Education and Construction

I have always attached importance to education. I have said that the country has many difficulties. It is better to run more schools than to organize more troops. For the future of the nation, those who govern in troubled times should work hard. Therefore, on New Year's Day this year, I announced that strengthening education is the focus of provincial administration facilities. Now, education in this province has restored the scale before the incident in terms of quantity, but due to the difficulties of talent and equipment, there are still many areas that need to be worked on in terms of content. Teaching staff have long been treated equally with civil servants, such as planning the distribution of daily necessities, temporary living subsidies, special life insurance, etc., have all been implemented. Although it cannot be completely ideal, it is still gratifying. As for construction, in order to adapt to the needs of wartime, such as the construction of highways, the improvement and management of public utilities, and the supervision of mines, fisheries, animal husbandry, agricultural reclamation, and sericulture, are all being promoted at an accelerated pace.

(4) Personnel and Other

I belong to the military and am accustomed to military service. This time I was ordered to serve my hometown and was supervised by all walks of life. I hope that the local elders expect that I will do everything I can to do what should be done. The so-called spirit of a soldier, I am willing to practice it, tell the truth and do not need to sing high-pitched tunes. Now the Greater East Asia War is approaching the decisive stage. We should abide by the National Government's policy as the basis for administration, and strive to strengthen and develop local military and politics under the three major goals of establishing public security, increasing production, and correcting thought. This is the key to winning the final victory. Fortunately, my subordinates, colleagues, or veterans, or scholars, or young people, can all understand the meaning of unity and calmness, and each of them can stick to their posts and work without exaggeration or falsehood. I hope you will give more criticism and encouragement. Qingming is approaching, and the spring is bright. If you are interested in visiting Jiangsu, I will always sweep the couch to wait for your instructions.

### Municipal Government Refutes Reclamation Company for Speculation

Citizen Xu Daoxiu, in the name of China Reclamation Co., Ltd., petitioned the Municipal Finance Bureau in the name of supporting national policies and promoting wartime production to rent 20 mu of land at Zhaojiabang in Xujiahui Road for reclamation. The Finance Bureau forwarded the petition to the Municipal Government for approval. The Municipal Government found that Xu Daoxiu had previously obtained many plots of wasteland in the city from the former Grain Bureau in the name of China Reclamation Co., Ltd. After examining its operating methods, it was nothing more than subletting the obtained land to farmers for cultivation, sharing the autumn harvest, and profiting from it, causing repeated disputes. This time, he again applied to the Finance Bureau to rent nearby land, and at the same time, he used the name of Fuxing Commercial Market to petition the Municipal Government, saying that it was to build a commercial market to revitalize the market. The Municipal Government believed that the petitioner's purpose was purely speculation for profit, and that China Reclamation Co., Ltd. had not been approved for registration by the Ministry of Industry, so it had strictly refuted it.

### Taizhou Fellow Townsmen Evacuate

The Taizhou Association of Fellow Townsmen in Shanghai has established an Evacuation Committee. All fellow townsmen from Hezhou who voluntarily return to their hometown should first register at the association at Dongzilaihuo Street, Minquan Road, so that ships can be hired to evacuate in stages.

### Enemy American Losses Increase, Fighting Strength Decreases: Minister Idebuchi's Remarks to Reporters

On the afternoon of the 14th, the Japanese Army Press Department of the Allied Nations, as usual, met with Chinese reporters at the Hamilton House. Minister Idebuchi reported on the extensive losses suffered by the enemy Americans on both the Eastern and Western fronts. His remarks were as follows:

Our Belief in Certain Victory Grows Stronger: During the extraordinary session of the Japanese Diet on March 10, Prime Minister Koiso's response and the speeches of the Ministers of the Army and Navy both stated that the Japanese Imperial military and civilians had long been united, determined to defeat the British and Americans and establish a strong position. The enemy Americans, due to heavy losses, intend to pursue a short-term decisive battle, but the unwavering belief in victory of the entire Japanese military and civilian population means that if the enemy attacks, they will undoubtedly be annihilated. It is reported that American military leaders are currently meeting in Washington to discuss operational plans against Japan. Although the purpose of their operations is still unknown, it is clear that they will face extreme difficulties in the future. According to Nimitz, the enemy Americans spent the same amount on the Battle of Iwo Jima as they did on the Battle of Peleliu, showing the magnitude of their expenditure. According to American newspaper reports, within two hours of the enemy American landing on Iwo Jima, the first unit suffered 25% casualties, and the second unit suffered over 22% casualties. The battle on Iwo Jima is still fierce, and the enemy Americans will continue to make massive blood sacrifices. Recently, the enemy has been promoting landings on the Japanese mainland or the Chinese mainland. Regardless of where they land, the sacrifices will be great. Such blind actions, making pointless sacrifices, are meaningless, and the enemy will eventually realize their mistake.

Enemy Americans Admit to Heavy Losses: Currently, the enemy Americans have suffered enormous losses in human resources on both the Eastern and Western fronts. According to an American broadcast on February 28, there are more than 600,000 wounded soldiers in American hospitals. Due to a shortage of nurses, a resolution to conscript nurses was passed in Congress. Furthermore, a bill to send 18-year-old men to the front lines after only eight months of short training was passed despite public opposition, because of the severe manpower shortage. The American draft board, without authorization, began drafting 38-year-old men who had already retired from essential military industries. As seen from the American broadcast above, their manpower shortage has reached an extreme point.

Moreover, Congressman Kara of the U.S. House of Representatives published an article in a British economics magazine comparing the losses of Britain and the United States, stating that the United States has already sacrificed more than seven million soldiers and spent thirty trillion dollars in war expenses. People are often misled by enemy American propaganda and overestimate American fighting power. Their losses in the European theater and the Pacific War are very significant, and their fighting power is decreasing. The enemy's recent strategic propaganda aims to end the war quickly, and their purpose is obvious. The more frantically and blindly the enemy Americans advance, the more intense the attacks they will encounter from our side, and the greater their losses will be.

### Reader Scholarship News

Memorial Donation for Scholarship in Honor of Respected Parent: Dr. Zhu Shaoyun, in memory of his late father, established the "Ziyun Scholarship" in the previous session. This newspaper selected three outstanding and impoverished university students and two high school students, and Mr. Zhu generously covered all their tuition and fees. This session, the program continues, with the addition of one more university student, totaling six students. A total of 182,260 yuan in scholarships has been delivered to this office and will be distributed to the students. Mr. Zhu's filial piety is inexhaustible, and he uses "cultivating talents" as a memorial to his late father. We respectfully express our gratitude on behalf of the recipient students.

Appointment Celebration Gifts Used for Scholarship Funds: Yao Benyuan writes in a letter: "Respectfully informing you, I was transferred from Bian to Shanghai in the 18th year of the Republic and have served as a police officer for over a decade. I have never taken anything improperly, not even gifts. Local people are likely aware of this. Now that I have taken office as the head of the Changning Road Police Station, I have received many generous gifts from various manufacturers and colleagues, which I am grateful for. Aside from maintaining my consistent principles and returning all gifts, the Yutong Tobacco Factory and Hailong Paper Mill, in particular, have repeatedly offered gifts that I could not refuse. To firmly reject them would be disrespectful, but to accept them would violate my original intentions. Therefore, I have decided to donate the 36,000 yuan in celebration gifts to the Shen and Xin newspapers, 18,000 yuan each, to be used as scholarship funds to aid impoverished students and to create blessings for the colleagues at Yutong and Hailong factories."

Herman School Music Concert Concludes

The concert organized by Mr. Paul, Principal of Herman School of Harmonica, was held on the morning of March 4th at the Majestic Theatre. Yesterday, a letter reported the financial details: total income was 674,000 yuan, total expenses were 615,900 yuan, and the school donated 16,300 yuan, for a total of 74,400 yuan. This sum will be donated to the Shen and Xin newspapers as scholarship funds, 37,200 yuan each.

### This Newspaper Establishes Free Elementary Schools: Saving Out-of-School Children and Supporting Teachers' Livelihoods
