### Japanese Submarine Units Active: Strike Enemy Ships Off Okinawa

Kamikaze and Special Attack Units Engage in Fierce Ramming Attacks

Tokyo, 12th (Central News Agency) -- Japanese submarine units have launched fierce attacks on mobile units and ship groups cruising in the waters off Okinawa, inflicting great damage on the enemy. On the 7th of this month, an enemy aircraft carrier group was discovered off the Iwo Jima Islands, and accurate fire was immediately carried out, sinking one special aircraft carrier. According to announcements from the General Headquarters or telegrams from the local area, the active situation of Japanese submarine units in the Okinawa waters can be seen. The submarine units have sunk a total of ten enemy ships, including one special aircraft carrier, delivering a major blow to the enemy's attempt to transport army troops as the Okinawa battle is about to enter the supply battle stage.

Tokyo, 12th (Central News Agency) -- On the morning of the 11th, Japanese air units attacked enemy ships in the waters east of Ryukyu, sinking one unidentified ship at 8:00 AM and another unidentified ship at 8:50 AM. On the same morning, special attack units also attacked enemy aircraft carriers in the waters east of Okinawa, damaging one regular aircraft carrier. In addition, from the evening of the 10th to the dawn of the 11th, Japanese air units attacked the northern airport of Okinawa Island, setting it ablaze and causing great damage.

Southwest Islands Base, 12th (Central News Agency) -- On the morning of the 11th, Japanese Kamikaze special attack units captured enemy mobile units in the waters east of Okinawa Island and launched sure-hit ramming attacks on large aircraft carriers and other ships. On the 11th, enemy aircraft launched approximately 240 sorties against the island chain.

### Japanese Forces Have the Advantage in the Air War

Southwest Pacific Base, 12th (Central News Agency) -- The U.S. air power in the Okinawa area has been repeatedly reduced due to continuous fierce attacks by the Japanese forces on ships and airfields. Particularly noteworthy is the sharp decrease in carrier-based aircraft due to the loss of aircraft carriers, with land-based aircraft accounting for two-thirds of the total sorties. The enemy's main airfields for land use, the northern and central airfields, have been repeatedly attacked by the Japanese army and cannot be used as desired. The Ie Shima airfield is still under construction. In the air war, the Japanese forces are gradually gaining an advantageous position. The enemy's land-based aircraft operating on the island are mainly small aircraft, numbering about seventy or eighty. About seventy ships are concentrated off Ie Shima and are working hard to maintain the airfield and supply work.

Lisbon, 12th (Central News Agency) -- According to a dispatch from Guam, Nimitz Headquarters released the following war situation bulletin on the 12th: From the night of the 10th to the morning of the 11th, Japanese air units made several formations to attack the U.S. Pacific Fleet near Okinawa, but remained conservatively silent regarding the damage suffered by the U.S. warships in the above attacks. According to the above bulletin, the Japanese army's strenuous fighting on land was also mentioned: The Japanese army launched its fierce attacks and numerous land counterattacks, and the battles on the night of the 10th were intense and continuous.

Guangzhou, 12th (Central News Agency) -- According to a telegram from Guam on the 11th relayed by Chongqing, U.S. Pacific Fleet warships and carrier-based aircraft, as well as Marine Corps aircraft, attacked Japanese facilities in the southern part of Ryukyu Island on the 9th. On the same evening, Japanese aircraft attacked U.S. ships in the waters of Greater Ryukyu, damaging two U.S. auxiliary ships, and Japanese aircraft bombed airfields. On the morning of the 10th, Japanese aircraft attacked U.S. convoys and local facilities twice. On the 10th, the U.S. Marine Corps 6th Division built a bridge across a river on Greater Ryukyu Island. On the morning of the 11th, when building a bridge, they suffered considerable losses due to the Japanese army's human-bullet resistance, and their progress was obstructed. Currently, Japanese and U.S. forces are engaged in hand-to-hand combat in several locations on the southern part of Greater Ryukyu Island.

### Fierce Land Battles in Progress

Southern Frontline Base, 12th (Central News Agency) -- Since the 9th, the enemy has launched a full-scale offensive on Okinawa Island again. On the 11th, they launched another forced attack. Near Maeda South and Awacha, the enemy, using tanks as cover, attacked with about 1,000 infantrymen, engaging in fierce fighting with the Japanese defenders. At the same time, the enemy's left-wing actions also became active. At 6:00 AM on the 10th, forty ships crossed the river in front of our Xiezhi. The Japanese army fought fiercely with them for an hour and finally repelled them. At 11:00 AM, powerful infantry with thirty amphibious tanks again launched a forced river crossing and are currently engaged in fierce fighting. Currently, enemy ships that can be seen from the land around the island include two cruisers and thirty medium-sized transport ships, and about one hundred others in the Kadena sea area. In Nakagusuku Bay, there are two battleships, seven destroyers or transport ships, thirteen medium-sized transport ships. Around the Kerama Islands, there is one converted aircraft carrier, two cruisers, twenty transport ships, and twenty destroyers or transport ships, moving back and forth. At noon on the 10th, a powerful force of two aircraft carriers, two battleships, five cruisers, destroyers, and eighteen large and medium transport ships appeared in the Itoman sea area, indicating that the enemy's determination cannot be underestimated.

### Asahi Correspondent Reports on the Bloody Battle of Okinawa Island: Mountains and Plains All Deformed

Tokyo, 12th (Central News Agency) -- So Sadatoshi, a special correspondent from the Asahi Shimbun's Okinawa branch, resolutely stayed on Okinawa Island to report on the bloody battle near Okinawa Island, sharing the hardships with the army and navy soldiers. The gist of his first report from the army is as follows: The enemy has landed on the island for more than forty days, with its main force of about six divisions, totaling about 100,000. Their naval artillery has been relentlessly shelling the Japanese army's positions day and night. The Japanese army's elite troops are also launching counterattacks, and the soldiers' heroic fighting is moving. The enemy's tactics on the Okinawa front are to adopt destructive attacks. The abundance of their supplies and the mechanical power they exert are unimaginable to those who are not on the front line. Before launching a frontal attack, they first use fierce artillery fire to cut off all communication and transportation routes. As a result, mountains and plains are deformed. Under the cover of intense naval artillery fire, enemy soldiers rush to the landing points regardless of everything. Japanese elite troops eat only two pieces of bread a day, never retreating, charging and engaging in hand-to-hand combat, repelling the enemy at any time. The front line has now stretched from the east to Iezu, south of Maeda to the Awacha area. It has taken the enemy more than forty days to advance to this place, and the consumption of personnel and military supplies has been enormous. Enemy tanks have been left stranded for four or five, and 3,200 enemy soldiers have been reduced in one fell swoop. The enemy's 27th Division and 16th Division on the front have been almost completely annihilated. As a result, the enemy has had to alternate combat troops. Recently, the enemy seems to have deployed the 7th Division and the 1st Marine Division to the front of the battlefield, intending to strengthen its combat lineup. They often use black troops as the vanguard, while the U.S. troops are in a supervisory position. However, these newly formed teams, under the cover of air and sea, continue to press forward and launch fierce attacks on the Japanese army's positions, and their combat intent should not be underestimated. In addition, as the battle on Okinawa is intensifying, the enemy has also begun to implement a strategic war, distributing small newspapers "Okinawa Weekly" by aircraft in an attempt to disturb the Japanese army's thinking, but their strategy will never shake the Japanese army's morale.

### Baojia and Public Security

— Chen Binhe

— Speech delivered on May 12th at the Shanghai Broadcasting Station

The Baojia organization is the basic organization for people's self-help, self-governance, and self-defense. Therefore, first, if the Baojia is well-managed, the local area can achieve the effect of mutual assistance and surveillance, and further, it can achieve the ideal of improving social customs and strengthening social organizations through mutual assistance and cooperation methods in social welfare and economic construction undertakings. Second, if the Baojia is well-managed, the local people's manpower can be concentrated, using the local people's own manpower to do their own local undertakings, laying the foundation for local autonomy, and becoming the driving force for reforming and clarifying politics. Third, if the Baojia is well-managed, the self-defense organization is complete and sound, it can supplement the insufficiency of the military and police forces, and realize the ideal of people's self-defense. All local security incidents can gradually be assisted by the people themselves. The security of a temporary or local area is small, and the security of a country is large, all of which will benefit from it. Among the above-mentioned self-help, self-governance, and self-defense, we particularly emphasize self-defense today and talk about Baojia and public security with all sectors of the city.

The citizens of Shanghai are now bearing a huge public security maintenance fee, which is the result of the Baojia organization not fully playing its role in assisting public security. If the Baojia organization can use most of the people's own strength to assist in maintaining local public security, then the government's military and police expenditures can save a large sum, or make the existing military and police undertake more significant national missions. In this way, the burden on the people can be directly reduced, and the strength of the country can be indirectly increased. Now the Baojia organization Zhu can take responsibility for local public security, although there are various other reasons, the most important is the issue of manpower and financial resources. Therefore, I especially hope that the citizens here will take a long-term perspective, think for the entire local area, and realize the principle of "exerting effort if you have strength, and contributing money if you have money."

Judging from the domestic and international situation, in the future, the situation in Shanghai will inevitably become more tense, which is undeniable; taking a step back, judging from the socio-economic dynamics of the city, due to the decline of industry and the surge in unemployment, the difficulties ahead are also conceivable. The Chinese and Japanese authorities, of course, have long had complete preparations for this point, but in order to enable all the government's strength to be used in a more meaningful way, if we can assume or at least share the task of maintaining public security through the Baojia organization, wouldn't the result be better? Taking our ally Japan as an example, the local public security of cities and towns during the war is also divided by the local residents themselves, achieving the so-called "exerting one hundred million total power in combat", why shouldn't we do this? What's more, in the event that Shanghai becomes a war zone in the future, wouldn't it be more effective for the citizens to assist in maintaining Shanghai's public security themselves?

The problem is not whether to agree in principle, but the difficulty in practice. This difficulty lies particularly in the financial resources. For example, the improvement of the self-defense corps, the training of Baojia police, and the fundraising of security equipment all require expenses. However, are the wealthy and business circles in Shanghai willing to work hard in accordance with the principle of "contributing money if you have money"? Taking the recent experience of handling municipal relief bonds, the goal of mobilizing 500 million yuan from the private sector has not been achieved in more than a month; looking at the amount of money squandered on entertainment by the general wealthy and profiteers, not to mention a month, even the amount in a week will be hundreds of millions of yuan! Here, we cannot help but deeply feel the decline of the public spirit and sense of justice of our people. Will such a society not have a day of decline?

But we must remind every wealthy and citizen of Shanghai: the flames of war may be approaching Shanghai. If you continue to value only private interests and do not recognize the situation, then today you are stingy to contribute money to the public security cause, and perhaps tomorrow you will have to swallow the bitter fruit of this lack of public spirit yourself! It is not alarmist, there is no shortage of tragic lessons in ancient and modern times. What we hope for is that the enlightened people of the city will quickly rise up to advocate, contribute money and effort, strengthen Baojia, consolidate public security, and establish a self-helping, self-governing, and self-defending Greater Shanghai.

### The Future of Chinese Youth

— Lin Junfu

Recently, I had the opportunity, thanks to an invitation from the New Century Monthly, to sit with Mr. Fan Zhongyun, Mr. Yang Guangzheng, Mr. Zhao Huaxing, Mr. Liu Yusheng, and others to discuss the current situation and future of Chinese youth. Among the Japanese present at the symposium were Mr. Wada Hitoshi, the Shanghai Director-General of the Asahi Shimbun, representing the wartime Japanese cultural sphere, and Captain Matsumoto of the Fleet Reporting Division, representing the Japanese modern military, who advocated the "25-Year Life Philosophy." Everyone present was able to frankly discuss various issues concerning Chinese and Japanese youth from the perspective of youth.

Political Power and Youth

As mentioned in the youth symposium, Japanese youth, after rediscovering themselves as Japanese from the storms of red ideology, have vigorously promoted national consciousness, completed the Showa Restoration, implemented the "25-Year Life Philosophy," and engaged in the Greater East Asia War. This is a fact. Conversely, since the Sino-Japanese Incident, Chinese youth, phenomenologically, have been in a state of divided or opposing national power in Nanjing, Yan'an, and Chongqing. They have been subjected to the chaos of ideologies such as peaceful pro-Japanese sentiment, resistance and redification, and resistance and national construction, as well as the disasters of war, to the extent that they no longer see the nation and its policies as the center of their thoughts or politics. As a result, on the surface, many only pursue personal gain or engage in actions that could be described as violating the nation. While this is a fact, it cannot be immediately assumed that Chinese youth have a shallow or non-existent sense of national consciousness. For example, Japanese youth before the Meiji Restoration seemed to have lost sight of the existence of the nation. However, as long as they were given education explaining Japanese history and pointing out the path that Japan should take, they generally understood and realized the potential for national consciousness and patriotism within them. The current situation, I believe, is not the fault of Chinese youth but rather the responsibility of the government or leaders who lead and educate them. Consequently, the youth in the peace zones, especially in Shanghai, are not bad. Compared to Yan'an and Chongqing, the Nanjing National Government's youth guidance and political policies are arguably insufficient to lead the youth.

However, as explained in the symposium, the youth under the governance of the Chongqing or Yan'an regimes are dissatisfied with the government's administration and social systems. This is a fact. In essence, resolving the fundamental issue of China's lack of unification is the most urgent problem that needs to be improved.

China's Unification and Youth

Whether in Nanjing, Yan'an, or Chongqing, there is no government or people in China who do not hope for China's unification. Similarly, the foreign countries behind them also desire China's unification, but their positions are vastly different, and their methods are unrelated. At the Seventh National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party, Mao Zedong, the chairman of the Chinese Communist Party, which is supposedly under one-party rule, issued a declaration hoping to establish a coalition government composed entirely of all parties and factions, to have the nation recognize the Yan'an regime and gradually encroach upon Chongqing. At the Sixth National Congress of the Kuomintang in Chongqing, Chiang Kai-shek also hoped to create a coalition government centered on the Chongqing Kuomintang, viewing the Chongqing regime as the only legitimate government, while positioning the CCP as merely an "armed political party." Although their policies and methods differ, their desire for national unification is the same. However, these are ideas centered on government officials or political parties and cannot be described as policies that truly understand the will of the people, consider the livelihoods of the people, and aim to develop the nation and its people. In other words, in the current situation, there is no shortage of thoughtful youth in China, but they are dissatisfied with and do not support any regime. From the perspective of Japanese youth, this is something that one cannot help but sympathize with.

The Future of Chinese Youth

The Chinese mainland is vast and boundless, with abundant resources and manpower, surpassing the world. Its location is of utmost strategic value to Britain, which seeks to counterattack the Japanese mainland via India and Burma, and to the United States, which aims to approach the Japanese mainland across the Pacific Ocean, serving as a final supply base or an unsinkable aircraft carrier. In other words, the Chinese mainland is on the eve of becoming the final battlefield between Japan, the United States, and Britain. This is the inevitable result of the Greater East Asia War. Regardless of whether Japanese troops are stationed on the Chinese mainland, this is the inescapable fate of the Chinese mainland. At this time, how will Chinese youth decide the fate of this land? Will they force the Japanese troops to withdraw, invite the United States and Britain into the Chinese mainland, and subject the country and its people to the imperialist aggression of European and American powers for over a century since the Opium Wars? Or will they cooperate with Japan to bring the Greater East Asia War to a victorious conclusion and secure glorious independence and autonomy?

I do not want to determine the future of Chinese youth based on a simple comparison of the Nanjing, Yan'an, and Chongqing regimes, because this is not a question that can be fairly concluded by comparing governments or government officials, nor is it something that can be decided by the political or military power of the current government.

The "Youth Symposium" of the New World Monthly, amidst high-sounding discussions, unknowingly reached its scheduled time, and the conclusion raised various important questions before adjourning without a conclusion. However, even if a conclusion were reached, it might not be possible to publish it now.

After the meeting, Mr. Liu Yusheng and I walked along Nanjing Road under the blackout, thinking without exchanging a word. At the parting, Mr. Liu said, "I will inform you of my opinion in a letter later." However, to this day, I have not received his letter.

And tonight, American planes will once again soar over Shanghai. (Ji Yi)

### Soviet Union Takes a Tough Stance on the Polish Issue - San Francisco Conference Prospects Dim

Lisbon, 11th (Central News Agency) – The first major hurdle of the San Francisco Conference, the Polish and Argentine issues, has been resolved in accordance with the views of the British and American sides through the collective power of majority votes. However, the Polish issue is of extreme importance to the Soviet Union, which has consistently determined Argentina to be a fascist state. Although the issue was passed in the plenary session, the Soviet Union did not retreat. Especially since the Soviet Union has been completely liberated from the war, it is inevitable that it will adopt a tough stance in international politics.

Molotov Submits Five Points in Writing Before Returning Home

Before returning home on the 10th after the end of the war against Germany, Molotov submitted five points in writing to the San Francisco Conference:

*   No joint action can be taken with fascist countries in international security institutions, as fascist countries are the root cause of reactionary centers and wars.
*   Some are advocating for the review of international treaties concluded during the war in the conference. This would not only fall into the enemy's trap but also infringe upon the sovereignty of the contracting states.
*   The Soviet Union has concluded mutual assistance treaties with Britain, France, Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia, and Poland, with a validity period of 20 years. This is a necessary measure to prevent aggression and should continue until these countries believe that the international security guarantee mechanism is strong enough to prevent aggression.
*   Regarding the Security Council, there is no proposal to change its mission and status, and the opinions of the conference hosting countries are completely consistent.
*   There is much discussion about the issue of colonial adjustment, but British and American opinions are in opposition. In order to maintain international security, the Soviet Union advocates that colonies become independent states and that national autonomy and equality be realized as soon as possible.

After the five proposals, Molotov concluded that the conference should review various fundamental issues within these two or three weeks and establish the foundation for a post-war security mechanism. Molotov's first point was directed at Argentina, the second against the proposal of US representative Winter Burke, and the third could indicate that the Soviet Union does not fully trust international institutions. If the Soviet Union's attitude remains unchanged, the San Francisco Conference will inevitably yield poor results. Finally, regarding the issue of colonial adjustment, it can be seen that the Soviet Union has begun an international political offensive. Britain and the United States are deeply mired in the war against Japan, so they hope for an early end to the European war. However, many difficulties remain ahead. In contrast, the Soviet Union has emerged from the war, holding an attitude of arrogance of "complete victory" to use its full force in international politics, and Molotov's written proposal is the first sound of the Soviet Union's political offensive.

International Trusteeship System Issue - British, American, and Soviet Opinions in Opposition

Lisbon, 12th (Central News Agency) – The international trusteeship issue has once again become a deadlock at the San Francisco Conference. According to reports from San Francisco, Soviet representative Zun Polia proposed to grant independence to all colonies in the five-nation consultation on the trusteeship system. A certain New York newspaper published the following on the 16th: Britain, the United States, and France did not express opposition to the Soviet Union's proposal in principle, but this matter would affect plans to establish strategic bases in the colonies. The Soviet Union's attitude towards this proposal is particularly positive. The five countries met again on the night of the 10th to review the matter, but the detailed contents are unknown. According to the Soviet proposal, the new agency's charter would apply not only to sovereign states but also to subordinate regions. This proposal is in opposition to both the American and British proposals. France, a colonial empire, opposes the autonomy of colonies, so the prospects for the San Francisco Conference are indeed bleak.

Soviet authorities seem to believe that one of the bodies is the remains of Führer Hitler.

### Tightening Effect of Gold Securities Issue - Preparation Committee Announces Inspection Notice

The Central Reserve Bank's gold securities began their first phase of issuance from the 7th to the 9th of this month. The total amount issued has been announced by the Gold Securities Issuance Preparation Committee at its first inspection on the 11th. The total amount issued was 13,957 taels. The Bank also delivered 1,400 gold bars, the total amount of the gold securities reserve, to the Committee, designating the Shanghai United Bank's vault for storage in preparation for redemption at maturity. After the issuance of these gold securities, the general situation regarding currency tightening and price changes has been of great concern to all parties. A reporter inquired with financial institutions yesterday and recorded the following:

Large Amount of Currency Recalled

The purpose of the Central Reserve Bank's approved issuance of gold securities is to tighten the currency supply, maintain the value of the currency, stabilize prices, stabilize people's livelihoods, and strengthen the wartime economy. In the past, the issuance of currency was affected by transportation stagnation, hindering the smooth exchange of goods, especially with rampant speculation in Shanghai, hoarding for profit, and manipulating market prices. The currency used to buy goods flowing into rural areas and other places was difficult to recycle. Speculation in Shanghai was rampant, with most of the currency concentrated in the hands of wealthy or illegal merchants, who used it for speculation. The fixed deposits of financial institutions were decreasing daily. Rising prices required increasing amounts of currency, so the government implemented various measures such as issuing value vouchers and promoting savings movements to recover currency. However, the results were poor, leading to a large amount of currency flowing into the hands of speculators, causing financial instability. Therefore, the issuance of gold securities is a superior strategy for tightening the currency supply. According to the first inspection report of the Gold Securities Issuance Preparation Committee, the first phase of issuance totaled 13,957 taels in the three days of the 7th, 8th, and 9th. After calculating the amount of 780,000 taels, a total of 108,864,800 yuan was recovered. If the Bank continues with the second and third phases of issuance and promotes the issuance of gold securities in cities such as Nanjing, Suzhou, and Hangzhou, not only will a large amount of currency be tightened in Shanghai, but also the currency flowing into various regions can be gradually and substantially reduced. This is truly a powerful force for currency tightening and has achieved significant results. Now that the Central Reserve Bank has recovered this huge amount of currency, it should reap the benefits of financial stability.

Price Increases Halted and Stabilized

Due to the issuance of gold securities and the recovery of a large amount of currency, speculative activities have been unable to function, halting price increases and stabilizing them. According to past market trends, when international situations change, speculators often take advantage of concentrated funds in the market to cause gold prices to skyrocket and public bonds and stocks to rise smoothly and rapidly, causing financial instability, rampant hoarding for profit, manipulation of market prices by the wealthy, and unrestrained price increases. Recently, the changes in the European situation have had a great stimulating effect on the market. Because the Central Reserve Bank issued gold securities, 10 billion yuan of currency was recovered, speculators were unable to operate, and the black market for gold and the opening of stocks have remained stable. Various commodities are also unlikely to experience drastic price increases; otherwise, there would have been turmoil.

Total Amount of First Phase Issuance

The Central Reserve Bank's gold securities, after the first phase was issued in the three days of the 7th, 8th, and 9th of this month, immediately transferred the number of gold securities sold, the relevant account books, and the amount of the corresponding reserve to be stored to the Gold Securities Issuance Preparation Committee. The Committee conducted the first inspection of the gold securities issuance reserve at the designated vault on the 11th of this month. The inspection team, consisting of Committee members Ye Fu (representative of the Shanghai Special City Banking Association) and Pei Xiang (representative of the Shanghai Special City Money Shop Association), confirmed that the results were consistent and reported them to the Ministry of Finance for record and issued a public announcement to ensure credibility. The results of the inspection are reported as follows:

*   Total amount of Central Reserve Bank gold securities issued, as of May 9, 34th year: 13,957 taels.
*   Total amount of gold securities reserve stored in the Committee's vault: 1,400 gold bars, totaling 14,001 taels, 5 qian, 4 fen, and 9 li.

### Constant Vigilance for Blackout - Hope for Strict Compliance - Statement by Air Defense Headquarters

The Shanghai Municipal Air Defense Headquarters issued the following statement: On the 10th of this month, the Shanghai Japanese Army and Navy Air Defense Command issued a notice stating: Regarding the blackout, from May 15th onwards, regardless of whether there is an air raid alarm, a stringent blackout will be enforced from 10 PM to sunrise the next day. In other words, preparation for the blackout will still be implemented as usual from sunset to 10 PM, but it should be especially noted that a stringent blackout should be implemented after 10 PM. In light of the recent frequent intrusions of enemy aircraft into Shanghai, it is urgently hoped that the general public will pay more attention to the blackout and actively cooperate in defending Shanghai. In the past, there have been cases of severe disasters caused by carelessness with the blackout. Headquarters has cited examples to urge citizens to pay attention, but the blackout situation cannot be described as good, especially as summer approaches and most windows are open, making it worse than in winter. It is hoped that citizens will pay full attention to the blackout from now on, so that such phenomena do not occur, and that there will be no violations, to ensure complete safety.

### County Administrator Tsai Continues to Inspect County Areas

Tsai, the head of the Shanghai Municipal County Administration Office, led Section Chief Shou Senxiang again yesterday to inspect the Jiangwan District Office and various districts, townships, and towns under the jurisdiction of the Shishan County Government.

Deputy Director Man Inspects Police Affairs

Shanghai Municipal Police Department Deputy Director Man, under the orders of Director Zhou, visited the Second and Third Battalions of the Security Police Corps successively on the 10th of this month. Man also visited the First Battalion of the Corps at 9 AM on the morning of the 12th.

### Yesterday's Tea Party for Newspaper Reporters to Bid Farewell to Director Liu

Director Liu Dexuan of the Municipal Propaganda Department, due to a recurrence of an old illness requiring immediate rest, tendered his resignation. Reporters from various newspapers, appreciating Director Liu's effective guidance and pleasant demeanor during his four months in office, felt deeply reluctant to part ways. Therefore, they jointly held a farewell tea party at the Jinmen Hotel at 3 PM on the 12th. Director Liu arrived promptly, accompanied by Director Gu and others from the Propaganda Department. Director Liu delivered a speech, briefly stating: "I am extremely grateful for your warm reception today. I am particularly thankful for your cooperation during my tenure." He then encouraged the reporters from various newspapers, urging them to thoroughly report news and complete the task of promoting national policies. Subsequently, Zhu Yongkang delivered a speech on behalf of the reporters, briefly stating: "Director Liu's earnest instructions and ardent expectations will serve as our guiding principles. Although Director Liu's tenure was short, his benefits to the press were profound. For example, regarding the key supply allocation, Director Liu's repeated negotiations and efforts resulted in not only editors and reporters receiving it but also general news workers such as laborers receiving the same allocation, for which we are deeply grateful." Afterwards, everyone engaged in friendly conversation until they happily dispersed at 5 PM.

### Shipping Management Bureau Establishes Taihu Branch

The Military Affairs Commission's Special Shipping Management Bureau, in addition to establishing Shanghai and Nanjing branches successively, is now establishing a Taihu aquatic branch due to the abundance of products in the Taihu region, requiring smooth transportation to facilitate the exchange of goods. He Jianbai, a major general, has been appointed as the director, and Hu Zi as the deputy director. Mr. He came to Shanghai yesterday on official business and stated that the branch office will be located in Wujiang and will establish six sub-branches in the Taihu region of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui, such as Huzhou, Yixing, Jiaxing, and border areas such as Changxi, Suwu, and Changxing, to promote the work.

Expanding the Zhejiang East Sailing Route

The China Shipping Company has recently seen significant development in its sailing department's business and has decided to expand the Zhejiang East sailing route. It has entrusted an agent to specialize in direct sailings to Ningbo. It is reported that the route will have two round trips per week.

It is also learned that starting from the 12th, the company has re-designated Fuxin and Fusheng shipping companies as agents, utilizing express tugboats to tow civilian ships, sailing to new ports in northern Jiangsu, stopping along the way at Changxiansha, Zhanghuanggong, Xinshenggang, Huangshangang, Bawugang, Tianxingqiao, Yangzhong, and Dongxigang, and has formally started its service.

### Rickshaw Strike Resolved, Resumption of Business Set for This Morning

Rickshaw Owners Must Not Arbitrarily Increase Rent

A rickshaw strike occurred in the city on the 12th. Vehicles disappeared from the streets, and some rickshaw pullers continued to operate as usual, leading to disturbances. The Municipal Police Bureau, to ensure public transportation and social order, strengthened its vigilance. The Fourth Section, led by Te Gao Yan Gen and others, investigated the situation. After inquiring with the person in charge of the rickshaw workers' union, it was reported that the rent for rickshaws, approved by the Construction Bureau, was 950 yuan per vehicle per day, but the rickshaw owners arbitrarily raised the price to 2,400 yuan per vehicle per day. With the cost of living rising daily, the rickshaw pullers could not bear the burden, hence the strike. They hoped that the authorities would make a fair judgment. The police bureau then summoned the person in charge of the Rickshaw Owners Association to mediate, ordering the rickshaw companies to adhere to the price limit set by the authorities of 950 yuan per vehicle per day to comply with the law. As for the need to increase rent due to the rising prices of rickshaw parts, the companies must submit a request to the Construction Bureau for detailed research, approval, and public announcement before implementation. After both parties agreed, a satisfactory resolution was reached. At the same time, the Construction Bureau ordered all rickshaw owners to comply with the original rent and not to arbitrarily increase it, and mandated that rickshaw pullers resume operations this morning.

### East Asia Public Corporation Increases Sales of Train Tickets

To facilitate passengers and prevent black market tickets, the Central China Railway Company has significantly increased the number of train tickets entrusted to the East Asia Transportation Corporation for sale, starting on the 13th of this month. The main office of the company at the intersection of Nanjing Road and Sichuan Road will exclusively sell first and second-class tickets, and the branch office at the intersection of Henan Road and Binshan Road will exclusively sell third-class tickets. Passengers will not have to wait long to purchase tickets. At the same time, the East Asia Transportation Corporation hopes that citizens will work together to completely eliminate the black market by absolutely not buying black market tickets. If it is indeed difficult to purchase tickets, they can directly apply to the company, which will do its best to assist.

### Taishan Police Bureau Arrests Black Glasses Thieves

The Taishan Branch of the Police Bureau has learned that recently, cases of robbing women's black glasses have occurred repeatedly behind the Nanjing Grand Theater on Ding'an Road and in the vicinity of the Baxianqiao Small Vegetable Market. The third section of the branch dispatched officers to investigate and arrested several habitual thieves, seizing dozens of pairs of black glasses. It is hoped that those who have lost their belongings will claim them from the third section of the branch within three days.

### Door-to-Door Vaccination Starts Today

The Municipal Health Bureau's cholera vaccination teams in various districts have been actively promoting their work recently. To expand the coverage, they will implement door-to-door vaccinations starting on the 13th in conjunction with the Baojia Bureau.

### Regular Public Elections for Baojia Workers, Lian Baojia Heads, etc. to Be Elected

The Baojia Section of the Municipal Police Bureau believes that Baojia work is a type of local self-governance work, and those who handle Baojia work should be enthusiastic about public welfare and be trustworthy individuals. Therefore, Article 12 of the Municipal Provisional Measures for Organizing Baojia stipulates that the selection of Baojia personnel at all levels must be publicly recommended by the lower-level Baojia personnel of the respective Baojia and submitted to the section for approval. However, because the organizations of various districts in the city were different before the recovery of the concessions, and the implementation methods were not uniform, the section has been reorganizing and innovating to gradually unify them. During this reorganization period, it was difficult to implement the aforementioned democratic election method. Therefore, it was only possible to refer to the provisions of Article 13 of the Provisional Measures for Compiling and Inspecting Baojia to handle the matter at its discretion. Now that the organization of Baojia in the urban area has been unified, and the reorganization has come to an end, citizens have gradually deepened their understanding of Baojia personnel. In the future, if there are changes in Baojia personnel, they can be produced and implemented through public recommendation. All Jia chiefs, Bao chiefs, and Lian Bao chiefs should be elected by meeting. The following methods have been formulated:

Preliminary Announcement of Suffering Day

Supervision of elections by personnel from higher-level Baojia organizations, police sub-bureaus, and the Baojia Section. If the Jia chief publicly recommends the Bao chief, the Lian Bao chief himself or a person sent by him will supervise the election. If the Bao chief publicly recommends the Lian Bao chief, the General Lian Bao chief himself or a person sent by him will supervise the election.

Meetings require the attendance of more than two-thirds of the people and the consent of more than two-thirds of those present.

Use a signed voting method. If the head of a household publicly recommends the Jia chief, the Bao chief himself must supervise the election. If it is not necessary, there is no need to request the police sub-bureau and Baojia Section to send personnel to the venue. After the personnel at all levels of the Baojia are recommended, they will be reported to the Baojia Section for approval and appointment.

This method has been submitted to the Baojia Section for approval and will be implemented from May 15th. In the future, the selection of Baojia personnel will adopt public recommendation, which will make it easier to select talents and advance the task. The Baojia organization should be further consolidated to strengthen local autonomy. The section specially issued orders to all General Lian Baos in various districts yesterday, the 12th, to comply with this.

### Goods Allocation Office Adjusts Certificate Issuance Areas, Using the Newly Defined Baojia Areas as the Standard

The Municipal Goods Allocation Office previously established 24 certificate issuance offices within the city to facilitate citizens in obtaining certificates. The first office belongs to the Central District, the tenth, eleventh, and twelfth offices belong to the Eastern District, the second, third, fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, and twentieth offices belong to the Western District, the thirteenth, fourteenth, fifteenth, and sixteenth offices belong to the Southern District, the eighth, ninth, twenty-second, and twenty-third offices belong to the Northern District, the seventeenth, eighteenth, and nineteenth offices belong to the Nanshi District, the twenty-fourth office belongs to the Pudong District, and the twenty-first office belongs to the Central City District. By the autumn of last year, the city's jurisdiction had been redefined by the municipal government, and the office's certificate issuance areas also changed accordingly. The Nanhu Caozhen in Huxi and the Yangjing Eighteen Questions in the southern district of Pudong were designated as suburbs, and the areas west of the Huxi Railway, east of Zhongshan Road, and Bailianjing in Pudong were designated as urban areas. Because the allocation is based on the urban area, the areas that have been designated as suburbs by the municipal government will stop being allocated, and those that have been designated as urban areas should be allocated. Therefore, the jurisdiction of the seventh office in the Western District and the fourteenth office in the Second District of Pudong are slightly different than before. It is now heard that the office intends to gradually adjust the jurisdictions of the offices according to the newly defined Baojia areas by the municipal government, starting with the seventeenth, eighteenth, and nineteenth offices in the Nanshi District and the sixth, seventh, and twentieth offices in the Western District. It has instructed the offices to jointly determine and report to the office for processing. The locations of the various certificate issuance offices are listed below:

Name Location

First Office Renji Shantang, Yunnan Road

Second Office No. 110, Jiangning Road

Third Office All the above

### Opium Prohibition Bureau Forbids Smoking of Private Opium

The Military Affairs Commission's Opium Prohibition Bureau, in response to the recent high prices that opium addicts in the city are paying to smoke private opium, which interferes with the government's opium prohibition policy, has ordered 135 opium retail shops, including Zhizhi Ji, to establish the Shanghai Special City Opium Retailers Joint Distribution Office. The original official opium will be sold everywhere by the police at a fixed official price: Western opium at 44,500 yuan per tael and Jiang opium at 26,500 yuan per tael (weight conforming to 98 standards). The distribution office has already been established in Ren'an Lane, Jiumu Di. Opium addicts in Shanghai can purchase opium at the official price there. Those who smoke private opium in violation of the prohibition order, those who do not report for voluntary abstinence, and those who have not obtained the third-period license will have their registration cancelled and will be punished for smoking private opium.

Short Commentary

### Water Supply Should Loosen Restrictions

During wartime, strict restrictions on public utilities are necessary and therefore, in principle, not to be criticized. However, restrictions on public utilities related to public welfare should have relatively reasonable standards and should not be arbitrarily imposed.

Like electricity, tap water is also a public utility, but the degree to which they are needed in public life is very different. Electricity restrictions can be replaced by substitutes, at most causing slight inconvenience. But tap water is different. Although well water can be used as a substitute, the purpose of setting up wells is for use after tap water is damaged. After all, disinfection is not complete, and it cannot be used as drinking water. Moreover, summer is coming, and water is needed everywhere for washing and hygiene. Therefore, the tightening of restrictions on tap water cannot be in the same proportion as electricity.

However, the authorities of the water and electricity company do not seem to have taken the above points into consideration and have severely restricted tap water. If the amount used exceeds the limit, a huge fine will be imposed. Complying with the limit will not be enough for use; exceeding the limit will result in a very large fine, making people suffer the pain of being punished no matter what they do.

In short, during wartime, public utilities cannot fully consider the public interest, but tap water, as a necessity of life, should maintain a minimum supply, and the relationship between tap water and cleanliness and hygiene should not be ignored. It is hoped that the relevant authorities will adjust this as soon as possible.
