### Both Huludao and Jinzhou Recaptured; Shenyang and Changchun Expected to Fall Within Two or Three Weeks; Major General Locke Returned to Shanghai Yesterday from Chongqing

[United Press, Chongqing, 25th] According to the "Today's News" here, the Central Army recaptured Huludao at midnight on Thursday. The equipment in the port was only slightly damaged. This means that the Central Army has gained a landing point in the Nine Eastern Provinces and can proceed directly to Changchun. The Beining Railway has been cleared to Lianshan. Military sources also indicate that Jinzhou has also been recaptured by the Central Army, but there are no further reports.

[Central News Agency, Huludao, 23rd] This reporter arrived tonight at Huludao, the only ice-free port in the Northeast. The city is in good condition, the buildings are intact, and the docks and shipyards are all usable. The scenery on the island is very different from the desolate scene when this reporter left in 1930.

[Central News Agency, Xingcheng, 23rd] After passing through Shanhaiguan, the National Army arrived in Suizhong on the 19th, pressed on to Xingcheng on the 22nd, and advanced towards Jinzhou on the 23rd. Another unit of the National Army seized Huludao, one of the ice-free ports in the Northeast, on the evening of the 22nd. Railway and telecommunications between Qinhuangdao and Huludao have now been restored.

[United Press, Beijing, 25th] According to news from the Northeast war zone, the National Army is expected to capture Shenyang within two weeks and occupy Changchun within three weeks.

[United Press, Chongqing, 25th] Major General Locke, Commander of the US Overseas Forces in North China, visited Chongqing yesterday and stayed at Chairman Chiang's official residence. He dined with Chairman and Madame Chiang last night and had breakfast with them this morning. He flew to Shanghai this afternoon. Before leaving, he had a long talk with Chairman Chiang. Although the contents were not announced, it is believed to have been a review of the situation in North China.

[United Press, Washington, 25th] The Military Air Transport Division of the United Nations Staff Delegation stated today: General Wedemeyer, Commander of the US Forces in China, told reporters in Shanghai that China has requested the United States to lend more ships to transport troops to the Northeast. Washington has not responded to this request but has referred it to the Military Air Transport Division of the United Nations Staff Delegation for instructions.

### Rumor: Soviet Malinowski Presents Three Conditions to Us; Partial Withdrawal of Soviet Troops to Original Defenses

[United Press, Chongqing, 25th] According to a newspaper here, General Malinowski has proposed the following conditions to China: (1) The Anshan coal and iron mine should be jointly developed by China and the Soviet Union. (2) The Soviet Union should have navigation rights on the Songhua River. (3) The electrical industries of the Japanese puppet regime, the Jilin and Heilongjiang gold mines, and the main arsenals in the Nine Eastern Provinces should be jointly owned and operated by China and the Soviet Union. Observers here say that if these conditions are accepted, the Nine Eastern Provinces will in fact be jointly owned by China and the Soviet Union and will no longer be Chinese territory. However, according to the Sino-Soviet Treaty, the Soviet Union recognizes China's complete sovereignty over the Nine Eastern Provinces.

[Another Telegram] The Communist Party Office announced today that the Soviet Union is expected to temporarily postpone the withdrawal of troops stationed in the Northeast to facilitate the airlift of National Army troops to key railway cities in Changchun. This Soviet decision is said to be at the request of the Central Government. The Soviet Union will also try to enable Chinese aircraft to land in Harbin and Changchun, but the Soviet Union is unwilling to be responsible for protecting the National Army landing in various places. The Soviet troops were originally scheduled to withdraw on the 2nd of next month, and the Communist Party spokesman said he did not know when they would withdraw. However, he said that the Soviet Union could not guarantee the convenience of the National Army outside the Changchun Railway. The Soviet Union is willing to help the National Army occupy the cities along the Changchun Railway because the Sino-Soviet Treaty stipulates that the two countries have common interests in the railway. The Communist Party also cited "well-informed sources" reporting that the Central Government's Northeast receiving officials will return to Changchun to reopen negotiations with Marshal Malinowski, commander of the Soviet Transbaikal Front. "The Soviet Union's attitude towards the Central Government is very friendly," and the Soviet army has "completely disarmed and dismissed" the Japanese Kwantung Army.

[United Press, Chongqing, 25th] People from the Northeast said that some of the Soviet troops who had previously withdrawn have now returned to their original defenses. The officials receiving the Northeast here are quite optimistic that with the reopening of Sino-Soviet negotiations and the rapid progress of the National Army, they can expect to return to Changchun. As of yesterday, only two of the 440 officials of the National Government who went to the Northeast remained in Changchun, and the rest had withdrawn to other places. According to reports, General Xiong Shihui attempted to take over the Changchun Municipal Government and police station when he first took office but was unsuccessful due to obstruction. It is said that the Soviet army told Xiong that it could not hand over the municipal government, forcing him to return to Chongqing for instructions.

### A Glimpse of Suizhong: The People Have Suffered Under the Japanese Puppet Regime and the Communist Party; Prices Are Still Relatively Low

[Central News Agency, Suizhong, 20th (Delayed)] This reporter arrived in Suizhong at about 11 pm on the 19th. The lives of the people in the area were undoubtedly miserable under the oppression of the Japanese puppet regime, but prices are still relatively low. Pork is 20 yuan per catty in legal tender, beef and mutton are slightly cheaper, chickens are 200-300 yuan each, rice, wheat, and flour are priced but unavailable, and sorghum is 70 yuan per dou, each dou equivalent to 40 catties of the old Tianjin and Beijing standard. There is a Japanese residents association in Suizhong, with 923 people, mostly women, children, and the elderly, with only 72 strong men. They receive two meals of sorghum per day, which they collect daily from the county government. Their accommodations are very cramped, and none of their clothing is intact. Some want to return to their country, while others do not. The local residents have been oppressed by the Japanese for nearly 14 years and have recently been harassed by the Communist army, leading to broken homes and deaths. Even those who have survived are emaciated and inhuman. There are three large bridges between Suizhong and Jinzhou, which were destroyed by the Communist army and can be repaired within days. The reception work is proceeding smoothly, and we can reach Jinzhou in two or three days.

### Zhou Enlai's Departure Delayed; Zhang Qun Talks About the Government's Intentions in Chengdu

### Japanese Prisoner-of-War Camp in Nanjing

— Han Xiaopeng

In the Tangshan Hot Spring Area

After the Japanese army surrendered, a part of the Japanese army in Nanjing and Bengbu, a total of 6,416 people, were concentrated in the Tangshui Town area, 70 miles south of Nanjing City. Tangshui Town is located in the Tangshan Hot Springs, a famous scenic spot in Nanjing.

The Japanese troops concentrated here are housed in four places, namely the Infantry Education Team, the Artillery Education Team, the Non-Commissioned Officer Candidate Team, and the Logistics Department Non-Commissioned Officer Candidate Team. Each team is a military education institution established by the enemy here. The concentrated Japanese troops are mostly instructors and students from the four schools. The four locations are more than ten miles apart, and Nōse Yūzō, a major general instructor of the enemy infantry education team, is responsible for liaison and management. Our army has only sent a company of infantry led by Hu Dexiu, deputy battalion commander of the 169th Regiment, to garrison.

The four locations are collectively called: "Tangshui Area Japanese Military Concentration Camp".

On the morning of November 13th, General Shi Zhongcheng, commander of the 74th Army stationed in Nanjing, specially sent Chang Jian, director of the Political Department, and Wei Zhenyue, a senior staff officer, to invite us to take a car to visit. Along the way, I felt some solemn and terrifying assumptions about the situation of the "Japanese Military Concentration Camp."

Our Magnanimity

Deputy Battalion Commander Hu, who is stationed in Tangshui Town, is a 22-year-old young man from Guangdong, who was born in Singapore. After the War of Resistance, he returned to his motherland to join the army and is very enthusiastic. He was wounded when he defended Changde to the death. He said: "When I came here to accept the surrender, I wanted to beat the Japanese devils severely when I saw them, to dispel the hatred in my heart. But when I saw them all like sheep, embarrassed and miserable, I couldn't help but feel compassion. At the beginning of the Japanese army's surrender, they were also very terrified of the concentration camp. They knew the cruelty of the concentration camps in the past and were very afraid of our retaliation. Later, when they saw our spirit of such magnanimity, they were deeply moved."

Our garrison is only responsible for defense. Nōse Yūzō is fully responsible for the life in the concentration camp and implements self-government. As long as you have an armband, you are free to go out to buy food. They have deeply understood our army and people's magnanimous and peaceful spirit, and know that we have never insulted or harmed him. We also allocated a large truck to the concentration camp to transport the Japanese troops repairing the road to a more distant place.

The officers and soldiers concentrated in the camp eat and live in accordance with the treatment of our army, and life in the camp is quite comfortable.

When the enemy surrendered, we did not touch the personal belongings of the officers and soldiers, such as clothing and utensils, except for military supplies such as weapons and ammunition. They once tried to give a pair of new leather shoes to one of our soldiers, but he refused: "We have plenty, we don't need your worn-out shoes."

Those surrendered Japanese officers still wear their khaki uniforms and high boots. Outside the internal medicine ward of the patient shelter, a piano is well placed in the corridor. As we were leaving, the sound of the piano floated leisurely from the ward. Before the surrender, could the Japanese army have dared to hope for such a life in the concentration camp?

The Spirit of Bushido

The spirit of Bushido, which has been promoted by the Japanese warlords for many years, has exhausted its military power and buried all the people of Japan. Now that Japan has surrendered and the Japanese army has completely surrendered, there is no news of any Japanese army committing seppuku here.

On the highway from Nanjing to Tangshan, five teams of Japanese troops are repairing the road in sections. When they see our car coming, they line up far away and stand respectfully on the side of the road. When the car passes, they salute us respectfully in unison. None of the Japanese troops who come out to buy supplies fail to stand upright and salute respectfully.

The rest station of the Japanese military concentration camp in Tangshui Town is Chairman Chiang's villa before the war. Nōse Yūzō, that short and fat fellow, received the notice the day before and led the Japanese soldiers in the camp to welcome us respectfully outside the gate.

In the living room hang the portraits of President Sun Yat-sen and Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, and the national flags of the two countries are crossed under the ceiling.

When we visited each unit, there was a squad of buglers standing respectfully in front of the door, blowing the bugle call to welcome us. When the car approached the non-commissioned officer education team, several Japanese soldiers were in the grass field. When they heard the sound of the car, they immediately ran desperately to the door of the auditorium to welcome us respectfully.

Life in the Camp

The enemy has treated and murdered our prisoners and overseas Chinese in captivity with abuse and cruelty, simply not treating them as human beings. What is the life of the Japanese army in the concentration camp after the surrender?

Each person can still get 17 ounces of rice, 8 ounces of noodles, 2 ounces of meat, and 16 ounces of vegetables every day. They can grow their own vegetables and issue their own mimeographed news in the camp.

Their sick soldiers can still rest quietly, get full medical treatment, and yellow chrysanthemums are inserted into beer bottles on the beds. Everyone's face is rosy.

In addition to repairing roads and doing work, they have not only not suffered any physical pain, but also not been subjected to any mental oppression.

Can They Really Repent?

Before the visit, Nōse Yūzō expressed to us in the auditorium: "The treatment in the concentration camp is very good, and all the officers and soldiers are deeply grateful. For eight years, we have been very impressed by the great spirit of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek and the Chinese soldiers. After returning home, we will definitely bring the magnanimity and kindness of the great Chinese people to the Japanese people."

On the wall of the infantry education team, there are many Japanese slogans: "Build a democratic and free new Japan" and "Eliminate Japanese militarist ideology."

The Japanese sergeant translator who accompanied me on the visit was a young fellow. His wool uniform was old and tattered, and his boots were worn out. I pointed to his leather shoes and asked him, "Why don't you change a pair?"

"Shoes haven't been issued for a year, what can I use to change them?"

He pointed to his uniform and said, "I really hate this kind of clothes. I would love to change to a suit."

Regarding the feelings of the Japanese army after the surrender, Deputy Battalion Commander Hu said to me: "Most of the officers and soldiers feel that the idea of ​​exhaustive military power is wrong and seem to be determined to repent. A few children of warlords are still very rebellious. They are very surprised by the democratic spirit of our army. When negotiating the agreement, the hierarchy is obedient, and there is no sloppiness. Private life is not divided between each other. The regimental commander and the company commander, and even the soldiers, can play ball or drink and play guessing games at the same table. They don't understand this, but they admire it very much. Although they have surrendered their weapons and live in the concentration camp, their concept of hierarchy is still very deep."

On the way back, in the car, I thought: "Can they really repent?"

### Education in the Recovered Territories

Since the recovered territories were taken over, almost three months have passed. All administrative policies are gradually unfolding, and the transitional period is slowly coming to an end, moving towards normalcy. Among the various measures, the education authorities have established certain principles regarding the handling of schools established by the enemy and puppet regimes. The general approach is that schools established by the puppet regime will be temporarily closed pending further action. All heads of puppet regime schools should be thoroughly investigated and punished according to national law. Teachers who worked in puppet regime schools must undergo a screening process. Students from puppet regime schools, regardless of their major, must attend a temporary university preparatory class established by the Ministry of Education for one year. Although the Ministry of Education has made the above decisions regarding education in the recovered territories, especially higher education, the Shanghai Temporary University Preparatory Class has not yet opened due to various reasons. As a result, students are out of school and lost. Recently, these out-of-school students in Shanghai have even organized petition groups to call for the resumption of studies. We believe that the authorities should make a decisive decision and quickly find an appropriate solution.

In theory, the education authorities' measures are, in principle, irreproachable; however, in practice, it is impossible not to consider certain important facts. Once schools are closed and teachers are screened, countless young students are directly affected. In Shanghai, if the Temporary University Preparatory Class requires students from different departments to gather in one place for one year of preparatory study, it will not only waste time, but also disconnect them from the subjects they originally chose to study. Although they are "preparing," their studies are practically interrupted. As a result, some students are still hesitant. Moreover, it is said that the preparatory class is delayed, and the excellent teachers from the original schools are being hired by other national universities. The ideal preparatory class teachers may not be able to arrive due to transportation delays, so the opening of the preparatory class is even more uncertain. In this way, young students currently have no books to read, which may have a serious impact on their psychology. Fortunately, under this situation, we see that the Minister of Education, Zhu Jiahua, proposed a very appropriate slogan during his inspection of education in the Beijing-Shanghai-Tianjin area: "The schools are puppet, but the students are not." Under this premise, the problem should be solved immediately.

Indeed, schools were established by the puppet regime, but students studying in puppet schools cannot be regarded as "puppet students." This slogan clearly indicates the basic policy of our government in dealing with education in the recovered territories. During the eight years of the Anti-Japanese War, our government retreated, but the majority of the people had to remain in their original residences due to circumstances. The power of the state could not reach the occupied areas at that time, so "puppet schools" were created. The youths who remained in their original residences are the youths of the Republic of China. As long as they are unwilling to be slaves to the enemy and traitors, they will not lose their right to study because they entered a puppet school. Today, because of the reorganization of puppet schools, young students are temporarily displaced, which is indeed a phenomenon of necessity. The country loves young people, without distinction, especially the young people in the recovered territories who have suffered under the enemy and puppet regime for eight years. Today, the mountains and rivers have been restored, and the government is naturally more concerned about their welfare. The government's current measures for education in the recovered territories are for their benefit. In the implementation of policies, it may not be as ideal as expected, but we believe that this situation can be improved. We would like to contribute a few suggestions at this time.

First, is the policy of closing all puppet schools a good idea? It should be reconsidered. Many puppet schools were originally national schools, and the reason why a puppet school is considered "puppet" is because its power is derived from the puppet organization, such as the puppet organization appointing the heads of puppet schools, and the heads of puppet schools then hiring teachers and staff. Now that the puppet organization no longer exists, the heads of puppet schools can be dealt with according to the regulations for handling traitors. Once the head is removed, and the government sends personnel to take over, the puppet school loses its basis for being "puppet" and is no longer a "puppet school." This can be compared to the situation of the Shanghai Municipal Government. Under the slogan of "The schools are puppet, but the students are not," a reorganization and resumption of school should be adopted to prevent students' studies from changing. This is roughly the case, and Beijing and Shanghai can follow suit. This should be easy to do.

Second, there is room for reconsideration regarding the concentration of puppet school students for "preparatory study." If the government sends personnel to take over puppet schools and they are no longer "puppet schools" in theory, if schools continue to open, students can continue their studies at their original schools. They only need to "prepare" for some extra courses, so why concentrate them in one place? We feel that "preparatory study" is indeed necessary. Young people in the recovered territories, who have suffered eight years of tyranny under the enemy and puppet regime, seem to have become disconnected from the development of the arduous resistance of the motherland and the evolution of the international situation over the past eight years. Not only students in puppet public schools, but also students in private schools in the recovered territories, really need to "prepare" for some courses again. However, this preparatory study should not hinder their original studies; they can continue their original studies while preparing. It is said that this is what Tianjin is doing, and it should be implemented in Beijing and Shanghai at the same time.

Third, regarding the handling of puppet school teachers, since the national government has promulgated the "Regulations for Handling Traitor Cases," it should only be handled in accordance with the original intent of the law, and not arbitrarily. Article 2, Paragraph 5 of the regulations stipulates that "those who have served as principals or held important positions in specialized schools or above belonging to the puppet organization" should be thoroughly investigated. Article 2, Paragraph 10 stipulates that "personnel of cultural, financial, industrial, freelance, autonomous, or social organizations within the scope of the enemy and puppet regime; those who have infringed upon others by virtue of the power of the enemy and puppet regime, and have been informed or reported" should also be thoroughly investigated. According to Paragraph 5, except for those who hold "principal or important positions," they are not on the list for investigation. According to Paragraph 10, if they are regarded as cultural organization personnel (which cannot actually be cited), it is only limited to those who have "infringed upon others by virtue of the power of the enemy and puppet regime" and have been "informed or reported" before they can be rejected. Other general education, in the original intent of national legislation, was not strictly investigated. Even if puppet school teachers need to be screened, it should be easy to do and should not be summarily deemed unemployable. What's more, those who engage in natural sciences, whose subjects are mostly unrelated to politics, and who have been burdened by various entanglements over the years, and have only endured humiliation and remained at their posts, teaching young people scientific knowledge behind enemy lines for the country, should be re-evaluated on whether they are guilty. To screen leniently is more in line with the country's intention to cherish talents.

The cause of cultivating talents is planned for a century, and is the foundation of the country's destiny. Now that the mountains and rivers have been restored and the people are recovering, we especially hope that the enlightened education authorities will care for young people and resume school as soon as possible. The future of the nation and the life of the country depend on it.

### Indonesia's Independence in the West Indies: New Government Faces Test, This Issue is Relevant to All Pacific Nations

[Central News Agency, Batavia, 24th Dispatch] The new Indonesian government under the leadership of Sjahrir will face its first severe test tomorrow, as the National Congress will meet to listen to the new government's main policy guidelines. The fate of this cabinet, established only eleven days ago, will depend on whether the congress approves or opposes it. The Sjahrir cabinet is composed of moderates who want to solve the issue of independence by renouncing violence, and are willing to compromise with the Netherlands if necessary. However, the opinion of the majority of the representatives of the National Congress is: "Whether we negotiate or not, we must insist on 100% independence."

[Central News Agency, Batavia, 24th Dispatch] Indonesian Minister of Information Sjarifou'ddin told Central News Agency reporters that the Indonesian government is prepared to submit the case of Indonesia's complete freedom to international arbitration if current negotiations with British and Dutch authorities break down. The issue of Indonesian independence includes many political and economic issues, which the Indonesian government and the Dutch government cannot resolve independently. This matter concerns all countries in the Pacific, so there is no reason not to allow Pacific countries to participate in the negotiations together. The Dutch government's strategy is to negotiate separately with the Indonesians and does not want other countries to participate, which is not only unfair to us, but also unfair to other Pacific countries. The Indonesian government is fully prepared to accept a fact-finding mission by an international delegation to dispel various misleading reports from here. We especially welcome representatives from the Chinese government to investigate the truth.

Any Form of Domination Will Not Be Accepted

[Central News Agency Reporter Wu Qianzhi, Batavia, 24th Dispatch] Indonesian Minister of Information Sjarifou'ddin told reporters: Indonesia does not intend to seek external assistance in its struggle for independence, but assistance is welcome if it does not involve territorial or economic demands on Indonesia. We are fighting for genuine and flawless independence, and it is no longer a question of sovereignty that the Dutch insist on negotiating again and again. The question is whether the current government is the de facto government of Indonesia. Any form of Dutch domination will not be accepted. If the Netherlands insists on using force to re-dominate Indonesia, there will be continuous revolutions. The world should recognize this point.

### The Lives and Property of Overseas Chinese in the East Indies: We Urge Britain and the Netherlands to Provide Full Protection

Joint Sino-Siamese Troop to Guarantee the Safety of Overseas Chinese

[United Press, Chongqing, 25th] The Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced today that the Chinese ambassadors to Britain and the Netherlands have been instructed to issue notes to the British and Dutch governments again, urging them to fully protect the lives and property of overseas Chinese in the Dutch East Indies.

The team has a committee in charge, with 16 Chinese committee members. Under the committee are three major teams, with 300 to 500 Chinese members, nominated by various communities and guilds to serve as outstanding overseas Chinese. Weapons are issued by the Siamese side, and the expenses are raised by the overseas Chinese themselves. Since the overseas Chinese have no other way to guarantee their safety, they have to increase their burden. This organization was established at the end of last month, and the overseas Chinese are slightly more settled.

### Dividing Korea into Two Military Zones: Kim Koo Expresses Opposition, Temporarily Does Not Request Other Countries to Recognize the New Government

[Central News Agency, Seoul, 23rd, United Press Dispatch] Kim Koo said after returning to Seoul: I will not request other countries to recognize the Korean Provisional Government for the time being, but I may raise this request in the future. I am here in a private capacity and hope to meet with leaders of various parties. The unity of all political parties is the first step to achieving independent and unique Korea. He expects that the situation of the Soviet-American division of Korea can be stopped early. When asked by reporters whether Korea might become a communist country, he replied: It is not possible to say for sure at present. I am a believer in democratic government. U.S. military commander in Korea Hodge solemnly pointed out that the return of the whole nine to Korea does not mean that the military government has recognized its provisional government.

[Central News Agency, Seoul, 23rd Dispatch] After Chairman Kim Koo of the Korean Provisional Government arrived here, Central News Agency reporters immediately went to visit him. He said bluntly: "I do not want to see Korea divided into two separate military zones." This 69-year-old leader of the Korean independence movement believes that this division will soon be cancelled, because he firmly believes that both the United States and the Soviet Union will do reasonable things for Korea. Kim continued: Currently, there are no plans to ask other countries to recognize the Korean Provisional Government, but he may request it in the future. At present, Kim and the personnel of the provisional government under his leadership have returned to the country as civilians.

The reporter then visited Liu Hongyun (transliteration), Chairman of the Left Wing People's Party. According to the talks, he believes that Kim Koo's return will make the various parties move towards unity.

U.S. Policy Lacks Unity

[United Press, New York Times issued today] It is regrettable that the United States and the Soviet Union have failed to act in unison in Korea. It said that the United States and the Soviet Union now have a direct relationship in Korea. If the two sides have a unified opinion and are willing to share responsibility for the future of Asia, they can get a chance to perform in Korea. But we have not seen any symbol of cooperation between the two countries, and even the two governments have not openly discussed it. The State Department seems to regard the Korean issue as insignificant, thinking that there will be a solution when the time comes, but we dare not agree. The Japanese army in Korea has been sent back to the country, but the US and Soviet authorities still do not consider a plan to withdraw the occupying forces and continue to split the Korean territory into two. We don’t know why. In 1905, we caused Korea to fall into unfavorable circumstances because of indulging Japan. Today, we should painfully correct our past mistakes so that Korea has a chance to recover.

### MacArthur Orders the Japanese Government to Formulate a Plan to Levy Profit Taxes: So That the Japanese People Know That War is Not Profitable, the Shidehara Cabinet's Position is Shaken

[United Press, Tokyo, 25th] MacArthur today ordered the Japanese government to submit a complete plan for war profit tax in the first parliament of the next year, stipulating that Japan's companies and private profit tax be levied, and company capital and private property tax be levied up to 70 percent, including royal property. And ordered to stop issuing military demobilization fees and military pensions for veterans from February 1 next year, except for pensions for disabled veterans. According to MacArthur, a few Japanese companies have illegally become rich for many years through illegal and aggressive wars. The war profit tax will not only start from the attack on Pearl Harbor, but will include a period before the incident, and will make every effort to expand its scope so that the Japanese people know that war is not profitable. After the implementation of this plan, the distribution of Japanese wealth will be fairer.

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 25th Dispatch] According to the US News Agency, Tokyo, 24th Dispatch, Japanese Prime Minister Shidehara met with MacArthur for half an hour today, but the content was not made public.

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 24th Dispatch] The Japanese Shidehara cabinet encountered what Japanese senior political figures called an "extremely delicate situation" this afternoon. Shidehara visited MacArthur this morning and met the Emperor. The tense situation may have been caused by MacArthur's order to the Japanese government a week ago to stop paying pensions to all retirees. The number of Japanese people affected by the suspension of pensions will exceed one million, 87 percent of whom rely on army and navy retirement pensions to make a living. According to current estimates, the Japanese government allocates more than 900 million yen annually for this pension and pension. What makes the Japanese even more uneasy now is MacArthur's instruction on taxing Japanese capital and war profits. The Shidehara cabinet will be shaken because it cannot solve this taxation problem. Well-informed sources in Japan said that the collapse of the cabinet will delay the election by three weeks or a month. Judging from the current situation, the cabinet is expected to last until the election is over.

### Reasons for the Extended Trial of Tojo and his Cabinet Members: Matsuoka Kanesada Surrenders Himself

[Reuters, Tokyo, 25th] General MacArthur issued a statement yesterday explaining the reasons for the postponement of the trial of Hideki Tojo and his cabinet members. According to him, MacArthur was ready to try Tojo and his cabinet members on October 7, but later, due to the failure of various countries to reach an agreement, it was feared that the trial would be delayed for a long time. He suggested that the example of the trial of Tomoyuki Yamashita be followed, and the trial be conducted by a US military commission.

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 24th, United Press Dispatch] MacArthur ordered the arrest of Kanesada Kashiko, a member of the Black Dragon Society, and Kanesada has already surrendered. Matsuoka Yosuke, who served as the Japanese Foreign Minister in 1940 and 1941, also surrendered to the Allied forces today while sick in Tokyo.

[United Press, Tokyo, 25th] Zuiizaki Koraoto, the 60-year-old brother of Masaki, who was formerly the commander of Dalian Naval Port, and a member of the Japanese Young Officer Clique, war criminal and his brother's trial, will attend the trial. Today, it was talked about that Tojo and his associates launched the Pacific War boldly because they were afraid of being punished for their failure in China. The military was the main factor in launching the Northeast Incident. He made a simple statement to the United Press, saying that I have never discussed the possibility of fighting the United States with Hitler or other people. This answer was caused by the fact that Nazi war criminals mentioned in the Nuremberg International Tribunal that Matsuoka and Hitler secretly discussed Japanese-German cooperation against the United States.

### Hull Defends Pre-War Policies to the Pearl Harbor Inquiry Committee

And Narrates China's Request for the US to Block Japanese Aggression

[Central News Agency, Washington, 21st, Associated Press] Former US Secretary of State Hull submitted a 25,000-word statement to the Pearl Harbor Inquiry Committee, defending his pre-war policies and explaining why he believed Japan would attack Pearl Harbor. He stated that accepting Japan's proposal for a meeting at sea between President Roosevelt and Konoe would either create another Munich or yield no results. China would also suffer a severe blow as a result. After Tojo succeeded Konoe as Prime Minister, Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek urgently requested that Britain and the United States send air forces to China to counter the threat of Japanese attacks on Kunming. Hull submitted China's request to the Army and Navy Departments for consideration. However, officials from the Army and Navy Departments implied to Hull that sending US armed forces to China to prevent Japanese attacks would not be approved. However, Hull stated that the Army and Navy Departments had suggested: (1) increasing material assistance to China, (2) accelerating assistance to the American Volunteer Group in China, and (3) not issuing an ultimatum to Japan, as requested by Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek.

Britain Once Requested the US to Warn Japan

In addition, there was another letter written by Churchill, responding to a proposed mediation plan with Japan.

[Associated Press, Tokyo, 25th] Japanese newspapers, due to limited space, have published very little regarding the Pearl Harbor tragedy investigation in Washington.

### Minister Chu Summoned Representatives of Puppet School Students Yesterday

Explaining the Meaning of the Temporary University Preparatory Class

[Our City News] Over a hundred students from puppet-run schools such as Jiaotong University, due to the preparatory class issue, went in a group to Kang Le Restaurant on Jing'an Temple Road in this city at 11:00 AM yesterday (the 25th) to seek a meeting with Minister of Education Chu Chia-hua. At that time, Chu was entertaining Mongolian comrades at the restaurant. Upon hearing the news, he immediately summoned the student representatives, listened to their opinions, and then responded to each one. He also informed them that he had already considered the students' concerns in detail. The Ministry of Education's running of the temporary university preparatory class was entirely to alleviate students' difficulties and not to make things difficult for them. He had said long ago that schools run by the puppet regime could not be recognized, but the students were not puppets. In order to enable the students to obtain legitimate academic qualifications, the preparatory class was being run. This was the necessary method to resolve the situation of these students. In the future, those who achieve a score of 60 or above in all subjects will be assigned to continue their studies in public or private schools. This method is exactly the same as in Peiping and there is no difference. Students should understand the government's painstaking efforts to protect students' studies and should not engage in unnecessary marches and waste their studies. The opening of classes is imminent. All unregistered students should register quickly in accordance with the regulations so that they can attend classes. As for teaching matters such as curriculum timetable arrangements, they can contact Director Li. Today it is raining, so they should return home quickly to avoid getting sick. The students were greatly moved after hearing Minister Chu's earnest instructions and immediately dispersed.

### Li Shou-yung, Director of the Temporary University Preparatory Class, Speaks

[Our City News] Regarding the actual situation of the Shanghai Temporary University Preparatory Class, some students have not yet fully understood it. The director of the class, Li Shou-yung, personally delivered the following written speech to the students at 9:00 AM yesterday at the Aikemei Road Airport: Since I took charge of preparing for this class, I have held over a dozen collective and individual talks with the students. The teaching methods I have announced in the past have been based on a consistent plan from the beginning, with no changes or additions. Because some students have not yet fully understood, I am summarizing the various points and incorporating the supplementary measures most recently established by the education authorities to announce the key points as follows (those that have already been broadcast will not be repeated):

(1) Regarding the curriculum: In addition to the preparatory subjects promulgated by the Ministry that must be studied, the required courses for each department will be fully opened. If there is a shortage of teachers, it is planned to entrust the special commissioners dispatched by the Ministry of Education to transfer professors from Shanghai schools that have been suspended in accordance with regulations.

(2) Teaching time: It is planned to use holidays and Sundays after the start of classes to complete one academic year of coursework.

(3) Grades in each subject: According to the supplementary regulations of the authorities, students who achieve a score of 60 or above in all subjects will be assigned to universities to continue their studies at the next level (for example, students who have completed one year of coursework will enroll in the second grade of this class. After passing the examination, they will be assigned to universities to continue their studies in the third grade, and so on). According to the above three measures, students' past academic qualifications can be completely preserved, and this year's studies will not be wasted in the slightest.

(4) The students of the fourth grade of Jiaotong University who were relocated to Shanghai have been scheduled to start classes within days. Students of the fourth grade of Shanghai Jiaotong University who have registered in this class will attend classes immediately. According to the Jiaotong University authorities, students of the third grade of National Jiaotong University are also scheduled to relocate to Shanghai and resume classes in the near future. Students of the third grade of Shanghai Jiaotong University will also attend classes immediately after registration. This curriculum will serve as the required curriculum for the third and fourth grades of the first division of this class.

(5) Students who complete the program in this class and pass the examination will be reported by the class to the Ministry for distribution to similar departments in schools of the same nature, ensuring that academic studies are seamlessly connected. Among them, students of Shanghai Jiaotong University, this class plans to report to the Ministry to distribute all of them to National Jiaotong University. Students of Shanghai Medical College, this class plans to report to the Ministry to distribute them to National Medical College. Other cases will be handled accordingly.

In short, the colleagues in this class are doing their best to uphold the President and the education authorities' earnest intentions to care for the young students and to seek convenience for the students in their studies. I hope that our students can study with peace of mind.

President Du is scheduled to go to Wenzhou tomorrow to preside over school affairs.

### Record of Chung Ling High School Teachers and Students Suffering

— Zhang Shu-ying

Chung Ling High School in Penang has always been highly regarded and is considered the highest institution of learning in Nanyang. It has a long history and a grand scale. Its beautiful and well-equipped facilities are the best among Chinese schools in British and Dutch territories and Siam and Burma. Before the war, there were more than 60 teachers and staff members and nearly 2,000 students. The teachers and students lived in harmony and were as close as family. After the September 18th Incident, they led the overseas Chinese in their efforts to save the country.

Unfortunately, on December 8, 1941, a bolt from the blue struck. The Japanese invaders invaded the south. When the news came, people were panic-stricken. Before long, Penang Island, known as the "Oriental Garden," was bombed by enemy planes, with flesh and blood flying everywhere and corpses scattered everywhere. The bustling city suddenly became a dead city. On the 16th of the same month, the Japanese invaders landed, and the overseas Chinese in Penang were plunged into a living hell where there was no light. The teachers and students of Chung Ling High School were also in a desperate situation. The following is a brief account of their suffering:

When the Japanese invaders were preparing to invade the south, special agents had already spread their nets everywhere. The leadership of the teachers and students of Chung Ling High School in their peacetime efforts to save the country had been thoroughly understood by the Japanese invaders. On the day of the landing, the Japanese invaders deliberately did not make any noise. It was not until the spring of the following year that the enemy police began to search, gradually moving from Singapore to North Malaya. By early April, Penang was being searched, and Chung Ling High School became their main target. A page of tragic blood history began here. At that time, many of the teachers and staff members of Chung Ling High School had already left Penang early, but there were still eleven people left at the school. One day late at night, they were all rounded up and imprisoned, subjected to waterboarding, candle burning, electrocution, dog feeding, nail hammering on hands and feet... indiscriminate use of torture, cruel and inhuman. As a result, those who died unyielding were six martyrs, including Li Ciyong, Guan Liangong, Zhu Xuanyi, Ke Cuotong, Lin Zhenkai, and Jian Dejun. The remaining five people were detained for more than three months before being released. After Cha Qitang was released from prison, he fainted on the way and died due to serious injuries. Rao Baiying soon died as well. Only Wang Shiyi, Huang Ba-fu, and Mei Yingrong were able to go home to recuperate and rejuvenate. Hundreds of students and workers were arrested, and nearly half of them died. The brutal Japanese invaders swept away the teachers and students of Chung Ling High School and destroyed all the school equipment to vent their joy. It is heartbreaking to talk about it!

Now, the tyrannical enemy has surrendered, the sky is bright again, order is gradually returning to its former state, and Chung Ling High School is also repairing its school buildings and is officially reopening on December 8th of this year. Recalling that four years ago on the same day, it was the time when the tyrannical enemy invaded the south. I was only spared from the position of Secretary of Chung Ling High School. The pain is so deep that tears well up in my eyes, so I write this down.

### Legal Basis for the Trial of War Criminals

[Reuters, London, 25th] The Nuremberg trials of Nazi leaders have raised important legal questions. Some international law scholars believe that although the scope of Nuremberg is broad, there are no precedents or regulations to punish the crimes of the defendants in Nuremberg. International law includes customary law and statutory law. The defendants in Nuremberg are being prosecuted because their acts of oppression, torture, massacre, religious, political, and racial exclusion, and confiscation of collective property violate the principles of humanity and goodwill. It must be understood that these actions are not legitimate actions of the state, extending its rule to other countries. From the beginning of their political careers, the defendants have had the malicious intent to endanger peace. However, can disrupting peace be regarded as a violation of international law? According to the Kellogg-Briand Pact of 1928, war shall not be recognized as an instrument of national policy. And the ultimate goal of the Nazi conspiracy is the very instrument denied by that treaty—war, and their methods of warfare are also greatly contrary to the rules of land and sea warfare, and before the outbreak of war, they repeatedly overturned international agreements that had been established and guarantees that had been made, and even the most obvious obligation of "one country not interfering in the domestic affairs of another country" was not fulfilled. From the Treaty of Versailles to the German-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact, all were destroyed by them. The establishment of the war crimes tribunal and the legal principles used by the tribunal are based on two international treaties, one being the declaration issued by Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union in Moscow in November 1943, stating that important war criminals will be punished by the Allied governments jointly. The second is the agreement signed by Britain, the United States, the Soviet Union, and France in London on August 8, 1945, agreeing to establish a court and formulate a charter.

### Promoting the Free Flow of Goods, Planning for Navigation to Major Ports, Customs Authorities Prepare Implementation Measures, British Shipping Companies Prepare to Resume Coastal Navigation

According to Customs authorities: Foreign trade in Shanghai, Tianjin, Guangzhou, and other sixteen commercial ports has been stagnant for a long time, and shipping has not been smooth. This has caused many inconveniences in commercial development. In view of this, Customs authorities are now planning detailed implementation methods for navigation. Once the Customs deployment is complete, they will immediately begin to handle it. It is heard that the established methods are only temporary in nature, and the final decision will await government revision and approval. Furthermore, in order to promote the free flow of all goods and to prevent price increases as much as possible to relieve the suffering of the people, our government is currently negotiating conditions with two British shipping companies so that coastal shipping can be realized as soon as possible.

### Zhu Jiahua Receives Comrades Who Suffered During the War

Minister of Education Zhu Jiahua received comrades and families of martyrs in the city who suffered during the Anti-Japanese War yesterday morning.

Mr. Zhu Delivers a Speech

Minister Zhu delivered a speech, stating: "I have been ordered to inspect education in the recovered areas and have come to Shanghai for the second time. I regret that I could not meet with you comrades earlier due to the urgent schedule. Although I am now in charge of education, I have served in the Central Party Headquarters in the past and have been deeply involved in the planning of wartime affairs and understand them best. The hard work of the comrades who sacrificed and fought on the front lines is the main driving force for victory. The Central Government has always been concerned about comrades working in the occupied areas. Although victory has arrived, there are still many difficulties in nation-building. I hope that all comrades will continue to serve the Party and the country with the same ambition as before."

Representative Responds

After the speech, Wang Weijun, the representative of the comrades who suffered, delivered a response, explaining that struggle and sacrifice are the duties of revolutionary comrades, expressing gratitude for Minister Zhu's concern, and presenting five requests, asking Minister Zhu to forward them to the Central Government: (1) To commend the history and merits of martyrs and comrades who suffered; (2) To provide special relief to the families of martyrs and comrades who are now disabled; (3) To give priority to unemployed comrades who suffered in finding jobs; (4) To ask the Central Government to strictly enforce the regulations on punishing traitors; (5) To ask the Central Government to resolve the domestic rebellion and bring about political unification as soon as possible.

Four Requests

Subsequently, Li Shiyong, Jie Shaqi, Yu Yang, and Wen Guang successively expressed their opinions, asking the Central Government: (1) To thoroughly investigate the enemy's constitutional archives and commend the unnamed martyrs; (2) To thoroughly eliminate the remaining forces of the enemy and puppets in Shanghai; (3) To establish a clean and capable government; (4) To quickly establish a school for the bereaved families of martyrs, and the relief of comrades who died should be the responsibility of local officials. Minister Zhu immediately agreed and answered them one by one, and the meeting adjourned at 11:00 AM.

### Collecting Deeds of Steadfast Individuals: The Third War Area Military to Request Commendation

According to the Political Department of the Third War Area, the Beijing-Shanghai area has suffered the most since the fall of the area to the Japanese for eight years. There is no shortage of shameless people who willingly sold out the country and acted as accomplices, but they are a small minority of the total population. Most comrades lived in deep water and suffered humiliation, waiting for the arrival of victory. Among them, there were well-known figures who bore the heavy responsibility of their hometowns but had no opportunity to escape to the rear. The enemy and puppets used coercion and inducement, but they were able to maintain their integrity and never give in, which is truly commendable. The Political Department of the Third War Area has now notified local governments to widely solicit information, hoping to report the deeds of such individuals with integrity to the department for commendation.

### Dai Gengxin and Others Fly to Chongqing to Discuss Resumption of Tobacco Factories

It is widely rumored that the government intends to eliminate and merge small tobacco factories. Small tobacco factories have prepared a written opinion and asked Mr. Dai and others to submit it to the authorities on their behalf. It is heard that this discussion will seek to solve the problems of purchasing and transporting tobacco leaves and paper, in order to seek the early resumption of tobacco factories in the city. It is also learned that the Zhonghua Tobacco Factory, formerly operated by the Japanese, has been taken over by the Ministry of Economic Affairs and is currently repairing machinery and preparing to start work.

### Communist Army in Southern Jiangsu Carries Out Destructive Work

According to the Headquarters of the Third War Area, the "New Fourth Army" in the Southern Jiangsu area is still destroying highways, railways, bridges, electrical and telecommunications facilities, as well as rural roads and rivers. The highways in Zhenjiang, Jurong, Danyang, Hetao, Liyang, Yixing, and other counties are all impassable. The Beijing-Hangzhou National Highway is severely damaged. Only the Su-Hu, Su-Xi, Su-Fu, Su-Jia, and Su-Chang fifth roads can continue to pass. The railway stations along the Beijing-Shanghai Railway have also been demolished, the rails have been removed, and the sleepers have been moved, resulting in repeated derailments. Wired communications between Beijing and Shanghai are also frequently disrupted. In the "controlled areas" of various counties, the Communist army has carried out large-scale destruction in order to prevent our army from recovering personnel and to prevent the National Army from entering.

### Restrictions on the Establishment of Bars

Xuan Tiewu, Director of the Municipal Police Bureau, considering that there are too many entertainment venues and bars in the old public concession and the old French concession in the city, which not only waste money but also affect public security, submitted a request to the Municipal Government to find ways to restrict them. The eighth Municipal Government meeting decided to determine the situation in each district. If the number of establishments is already large, no new establishments will be allowed in the future. If the number is small, the establishment can be approved. The Municipal Police Bureau has ordered the Business Inspection Section to formulate detailed measures for the above regulations, which will be implemented soon.

### Mayor Qian Talks About Merchants' Duty to Treat Allied Soldiers Favorably

Since the recovery of Shanghai, the number of Allied soldiers arriving in Shanghai has been increasing day by day. All citizens of the city should warmly welcome them and provide favorable treatment and convenience for their daily needs such as food, lodging, and the purchase of goods. It is heard that unscrupulous merchants have exceeded legal profits in order to obtain undue benefits, or have failed to fulfill their integrity in terms of accommodation, food, and entertainment for the Allied soldiers, or have inevitably discriminated against them, all of which are insufficient to express the Chinese people's sincere friendship to the Allied soldiers and are inappropriate. In addition to ordering strict investigations and corrections, it is hoped that all merchants in the city will uphold President Chiang's order to protect friendly nationals and treat Allied soldiers favorably. In the future, all hotels, restaurants, and entertainment venues must not have extra demands, and legal transactions should be made for Allied soldiers to purchase goods, in order to maintain good relations and emphasize commercial ethics.

Commercial News

### Prices in a Downturn: A Week's Financial and Commercial Trends, Gold Price Fluctuates

Finance: Last week, the city's finances were tight on the surface but loose in reality. The daily interest rate of 1,000 yuan nominally rose from 10 cents to 30 cents, or 9 yuan per month, but the hidden interest rate fell from 18 cents to 15 cents, or 150 yuan per month. The price of gold first rose sharply due to the Municipal Bureau's crackdown on Chinese stocks, and speculators concentrated on the gold market, reaching a peak of 895,000 yuan. Then, it was reported that the gold market in Tianjin was cheaper, and the price fell, reaching a low of 740,000 yuan. Finally, due to China's participation in the monetary agreement, buying became tighter, and the week closed at 815,000 yuan, down 30,000 yuan from the previous week. It was once rumored that the United States would raise the price of silver. The most stimulated silver, with a fineness of 935374, reached a peak of 750 yuan. Silver coins, each containing 23.493348 grams of pure silver, saw a peak of 500 yuan on Wednesday due to U.S. troops searching for Mexican eagle coins, equivalent to 100,000 counterfeit currency. The week closed at 430 yuan, still up 30 yuan from the previous week. U.S. dollars were cheap and plentiful in Hong Kong and North China. Although there were high-priced sales in Chongqing and Kunming, the low was still 1,250 yuan. The week closed at 1,330 yuan, down 90 yuan from the previous week. Hong Kong dollars were extremely stable, with old issues up 10 yuan and new issues up 1 yuan.

Securities: Public bonds will be officially restored in the spring. The financial community is buying on dips, and with the victory of the National Army in the Northeast, new buyers are increasing. Unified Class C stood at 300 yuan, up 30 yuan from the previous week. The remaining Classes A, B, D, and E still stood at the 200 yuan mark. From the perspective of interest, it is more advantageous to buy these than Class C with the same 6% interest rate. Chinese stocks were first suspended due to the authorities taking over the stock exchange, and then speculators secretly traded in popular stocks. The price of Wing On Textile Mill fell 60 yuan to 420 yuan, Meiya Silk Mill fell 85 yuan to 280 yuan, and Jingfu fell 9 yuan and 5 jiao to 22 yuan and 5 jiao. Foreign stocks were sluggish because foreign companies were subject to Chinese law and could not be as free as before the incident. Ewo Cotton Mill's stock fell to 1,460 yuan, down 340 yuan from the previous week.

Goods: In terms of commodities, due to the government's low-price cotton cloth, cigarettes, matches, soap, candles, sugar, and the arrival of a large number of American cotton and wheat from overseas, importers and exporters sold off February futures, and people's hearts were abnormally soft. Analysis shows that food prices have generally fallen. Thick japonica, thin indica, and foreign autumn rice retreated rapidly from the peak of 12,000 yuan to 8,500 yuan to 9,500 yuan per picul, down 2,500 yuan from the previous week, as new goods from the interior entered the market in large quantities. Flour, only 44 catties per bag, once reached an unprecedented peak of 3,725 yuan, or 750,000 counterfeit currency. Finally, due to the cheap price of rice and the supply of American flour, it fell back to 3,450 yuan, a slight decrease of 50 yuan from the previous week. Among miscellaneous grains, wheat was suppressed by flour mills and American wheat, falling from 3,700 yuan to 3,000 yuan. Corn fell from 3,100 yuan to 2,750 yuan. Soybeans fell sharply by 1,050 yuan to 4,250 yuan, which led to edible oil falling sharply by 6,000 yuan, with crude oil at 23,000 yuan per 100 catties and soybean oil at 22,700 yuan. It is heard that every 100 catties of soybeans can be squeezed into 10 catties and a half of oil. The soybean cake after squeezing is used for fertilizing the fields. Shanghai factories also use it as a raw material for soy sauce, making a considerable profit. White sugar and red sand fell to 57,000 yuan to 62,000 yuan due to customs auctions of large stocks, down 12,000 yuan from the previous week. Tea has sales to both domestic and foreign merchants, and the price is 500 yuan higher, with stir-fried green tea at 30,000 yuan per picul and low-grade Keemun black tea at 22,500 yuan. Clothing and cotton were affected by the arrival of American cotton in Shanghai. Textile merchants switched to purchasing American cotton. Tongzhou cotton returned to 70,000 yuan, fire machine cotton 45,000 yuan, each falling 25,000 yuan. Cotton yarn rose by 170,000 yuan to 1.3 million yuan for 42 counts due to the purchase of fine yarn by merchants from Hankou, Changsha, and other places. The price of 32 counts and below fell by 30,000 to 80,000 yuan, depending on the price of raw cotton and gold. Cotton cloth, fine cloth, and serge were firm. Only Qishi Lin fell by 1,500 yuan, with a price of 56,500 yuan per 10 yards. Artificial silk, due to a certain stock about to be released, the price of Tianqiao brand with 200 pounds per pack fell rapidly from 700,000 yuan to 560,000 yuan, and the warehouse receipt was only 430,000 yuan. Raw silk mills are not doing well. The price of high-grade goods, 60 kilograms per picul, fell from 1.1 million yuan to 1 million yuan. Fuels are selling well in winter, and the price of Yangquan coal rose sharply by 160,000 yuan to 420,000 yuan per ton. The price of coal balls rose to 2,3000 yuan per picul, also up 4500 yuan. However, there is a lot of firewood being transported by land and water, and the price has fallen to 1,800 yuan. Among other cigarette categories, the price of British American Tobacco fell sharply. The price of 50,000 Big Ben cigarettes fell sharply from 1.04 million yuan to 650,000 yuan. Soap, due to the term of flat sales, fell by 5,000 to 5,500 yuan each. Huangxiangmao, with 120 pieces per box, sold for 10,500 yuan. Western candles, White Levis, fell by 6,500 yuan due to flat sales. Yafeng brand matches also fell by 5,000 yuan to 125,000 yuan. Newsprint, 500 sheets per ream, fell from 20,000 yuan to 17,500 yuan. Caustic soda, 600 catties per piece, fell from 700,000 yuan to 580,000 yuan. Pharmaceuticals, quinine, fell by 4,500 yuan per thousand pills to 32,000 yuan. All commodities are in a downturn. (Chongbo)

### Arrangement of Book Capital Amount

— Pan Shihao

Recently, due to the exchange of counterfeit Central Reserve Bank notes, businesses in the industrial and commercial sectors are reorganizing their accounts because it is inappropriate to continue recording amounts using the counterfeit notes. However, there is no standard method for determining how the capital amount should be consolidated or converted. The Accountants Association and the Industrial and Commercial Law Research Committee of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce are discussing this issue. Our newspaper has received articles from various parties discussing the matter and will publish them over several days to assist the industrial and commercial sectors. (Reporter)

Since the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, the recovered areas are awaiting comprehensive management. The adjustment of capital amounts is the first issue that has caused us anxiety regarding the reorganization of industrial and commercial enterprises. During the eight years of war, the structure of businesses and the currency situation have become abnormal, and accounting systems have been forced to make strained cover-ups, going beyond the scope of normal principles. If we do not quickly catch up and carry out a comprehensive reorganization, how can we continue the past and open up the future? The capital amount is the first problem to be determined in accounting treatment, and its importance is a cause for anxiety for all those who study accounting, engage in business, even those who create laws, implement policies, and guide various industries. The Accountants Association and the Chamber of Commerce of this city have separately established specialized conferences and industrial and commercial law research committees to thoroughly discuss the matter. The entire business community of the city is closely watching the development of this issue. The author studied accounting in his early years and has been engaged in industry and commerce in recent years, and his personal feelings are particularly profound. He has received inquiries from various parties, but is ashamed to have no practical and easy-to-implement solutions to offer to society. However, there is one thing I would like to remind everyone:

The True Meaning of Capital: Capital is the remainder of assets minus liabilities. It does not represent the current currency contributed by the capital owner. In other words, the book capital amount is an abstract number representing the net assets of the capital owner and does not have an independent form like general assets and liabilities. As for the fact that the book capital amount often does not match the current value of net assets, and it can even be said that they never match, this is due to the accounting valuation policies and the business strategy of "laying a foundation." It has nothing to do with the total amount of capital itself. For example, if a capital owner invests one million yuan to run a factory, the original investment is the currency in circulation at the time. However, once operations begin, there are the equipment of fixed assets, the purchase of raw materials, the payment of labor expenses, the income from sales, and the financial transactions with banks and money houses, which are constantly evolving and changing infinitely. In accounting, a single transaction of receiving one million yuan of capital has long been transformed into various other transaction behaviors. Although the book capital amount is still this one million yuan, in fact, the net assets remaining after deducting liabilities have long been inconsistent with this amount, and it can be said that changes that are inconsistent with this amount occur at every moment. The result of this inconsistency may be profit or loss, with no fixed pattern. If the investors and operators wish to carry out final accounts frequently, settle the profits and losses, and adjust the book capital amount according to the procedures for increasing or decreasing capital, that is acceptable. Or they can delay the final accounts (of course, this cannot exceed one accounting year), and when the final accounts are made, deliberately hide the profits and losses, or falsely inflate the losses, so that the book capital amount remains unchanged or changes less. In short, the fact that the book capital amount cannot fully match the current value of the net assets that should be under the capital owner's account is a technical and even policy issue in accounting and management. However, there is no doubt that this capital amount is not the capital owner's existing currency amount. If so, we can then:

Calculate Two Hundred as One. Why is this two hundred to one? It is because the central government felt pity for the people in the recovered areas who were suffering from the circulation of counterfeit Central Reserve Bank notes, and set this ratio to order national financial institutions to exchange them to settle this account. It does not mean that general creditor and debtor relationships must be handled with such a ratio. Nor does it mean that the capital amount of the capital owner must also be converted according to this ratio. Moreover, it seems that the central government has flexible methods for reorganizing counterfeit notes in the recovered areas, which can be seen more clearly from the conversion rate of counterfeit Federal Reserve notes. Today's discussion of the capital amount reorganization problem focuses on the standard of two hundred to one. However, they do not know that capital is not cash and is not the capital owner's existing counterfeit Central Reserve Bank notes. If we speak from an accounting perspective, assets minus liabilities equals capital, and the equation is originally balanced. In layman's terms, the total of receipts and payments of various accounts on the books is originally "balanced." If you want to apply a conversion rate, you only need to make the ratio equal, and the total of receipts and payments on both sides will still be equal. The result of any increases or decreases in these assets through receipts and payments transactions still belongs to the capital owner, so there should not be much difference. However, from the perspective of business operations and current laws, there are many problems. For example, if the book value of assets is depreciated, there will inevitably be more book profits when these assets are traded. Therefore, the issues of labor-capital profit sharing and tax collection by tax authorities will cause unreasonable losses to the capital owner. Conversely, if the book value of assets is raised, the capital owner will have disguised and transferred unrealized profits into capital, which people will see as depriving workers of bonuses and evading national taxes, all of which we do not want to hear. In my opinion, the book value of capital can be appropriately increased according to the actual situation of each company, without harming labor bonuses and without evading national taxes, up to the point where the current book value is still retained to offset the legal tender amount. For liabilities that can be repaid at a rate of two hundred to one, they can naturally be discounted. Among fixed assets, it is acceptable to selectively increase those whose difference from the current value is particularly large, so that the book capital amount can still be recorded in legal tender at or near the original amount in recent years. (To be continued)

### Small Statistics

The Social Affairs Bureau announced that all industrial and commercial enterprises registered with the ministry or bureau before 1937 must submit reports by a deadline in order to exchange their registration certificates. As a result, 273 industrial enterprises and 106 commercial enterprises, totaling 379, reported.

In the past two months, labor disputes have occurred frequently. The competent authority has handled 228 cases, of which 115 were settled through mediation and 25 were settled independently.

### Deputy Minister Xu Instructs on Propaganda Work Tomorrow Hosts Press Corps

Xu Xiaoyan, Deputy Minister of the Central Propaganda Department, continued to convene personnel from the Central Propaganda Department in Shanghai yesterday morning to provide instructions on propaganda work. He attended a banquet hosted by the operators of the News Daily at noon. The authorities of the China-America-Japan Daily held a banquet in his honor in the evening. Xu is scheduled to hold a tea party at the Kang Le Restaurant on Jing'an Temple Road at 3:00 PM on the 27th to address the press corps in the city. In addition, Zhang Daofan, Chairman of the Central Cultural Movement Committee, originally scheduled to hold a tea party for the city's cultural circles at the YMCA on Baxianqiao Road at 3:00 PM on the 28th, has decided to jointly host the event with Deputy Minister Xu.

### Newspapers and Magazines Should Quickly Register

The person in charge of the Social Affairs Bureau stated: There are quite a few newspapers currently published in the city. According to recent statistics, there are a total of 29 (including 20 in Chinese and 9 in Western languages). Less than 20 have registered with the Social Affairs Bureau. There are currently 130 periodicals and magazines being published, and 64 have registered with the Social Affairs Bureau. The deadline for registration with the Social Affairs Bureau is approaching. If the registration procedures are not completed by the deadline, the Social Affairs Bureau will, in order to enforce central government laws and regulations, impose a punishment of suspending publication, regardless of whether it is a newspaper or a periodical magazine.

Spring and Autumn

### Beautiful Shot

— Huang Jiayin

On November 22nd, the Associated Press issued a telegram depicting an absolutely beautiful shot. Unfortunately, many Chinese newspapers ignored this telegram, so most readers did not have the opportunity to read it.

The telegram was sent from San Pedro Naval Port in the United States, saying: "Admiral Halsey, commander of the US Third Fleet, nicknamed 'Bull,' sadly ended his naval career. He said, 'I have lost my right hand.' Admiral Halsey lowered the four-star admiral's flag on the USS South Dakota and handed over command to Admiral Kinman. Admiral Kinman praised Halsey's achievements and said he had ended the most glorious career in naval history. During the ceremony, all 2,000 naval officers and soldiers on board the ship stood at attention and saluted."

This short telegram may be ordinary in the United States, but in the eyes of our Chinese people, it seems like something from a paradise. Because in other countries, the nationalization of the military is no longer an issue. An entire army, navy, and air force can be transferred from one general to another without bloodshed or a single bullet fired. Everyone is serving the country without any dissent. But this is still rare in our China.

To make China truly a decent modern country, the military must be nationalized, not the private property and tool of individuals or parties. When scenes like Halsey's retirement appear in China, China can embark on the road to democracy.

### Prodigal Son

— Lei Wen

The prodigal son wanders in the mountains and wilds, the soles of his shoes are worn through, and his face is covered with dirt. He has tumbled through countless somersaults in this sea of unfamiliar faces and seen countless strange, indifferent faces. So: he is tired. He thinks of the warmth of his family and wants to return to his father's arms.

As recorded in the Bible, the prodigal son had many dreams on the road. He dreams that he has returned, his father is standing at the door to greet him, he runs over, kneels at his father's knees, kisses his feet, the old man puts a hat woven with flowers on the prodigal son's head, blesses him with jade fingers, and orders the cook to kill pigs and sheep and prepare good wine. On this day, glory is given to the prodigal son.

The prodigal son walks on the road home, and it is snowing heavily. The thin, torn clothes cannot block the cold. A blizzard blows in the distance. He remembers his mother and dreams of a brocade robe on his body. His mother's warm gaze brings pleasant awakening.

He is walking home with a beautiful dream. A little bit of the warm atmosphere of home teases him. The front is like a vast plain, the trees contain verdant green, full fruits ripen on the branches, phoenixes and peacocks fly in the air, and mandarin ducks flutter their wings in the small river.

Forgetting the abandonment and hardship, letting the snow water seep into the worn-through soles of his shoes, and the cold wind covers his torn clothes, the prodigal son no longer feels pain. His hometown is beckoning to him.

One day, on a gloomy night, in the jungle, the prodigal son sees the light on the windows of his old home. A tremor of joy runs through his blood, as if his whole body has been suddenly liberated. He rushes over with rapid steps, rushes to the corner of the old house, and he is stunned:

In the abandoned garden, his mother's grave is overgrown with trees. His father is trapped in bed, gasping for the remnants of his twilight years. The cowshed and sheepfold, without cows and sheep, stare blankly at the cold leaden sky with strange eyes. The servants' bedrooms have also collapsed.

In the declining hall, the eldest brother is grabbing the second brother's ear and shouting loudly:

"The part of the property that belongs to the prodigal son should be managed by me!"

The father struggles to lift his remaining body from the dilapidated wooden bed and weakly rebukes:

"It must be kept, I am not dead yet!"

But the candlelight has burned out, and the decaying wood cannot support the giant mansion. The old man collapses on the bed, and the earth cracks.

The prodigal son stands desolately at the corner of the wall, like a defeated rooster. Coldness wraps his body, and everything is desolate and sad. He slowly turns around and walks towards the road he came from.

The footprints of the prodigal son are imprinted on the snow, one deep and huge footprint after another.

### Thinking of Our Cultural Figures

— Zi Mang

Can we not be saddened when reading news about the lives of cultural figures in the wartime capital? There are poets lying in hospital beds suffering from severe tuberculosis, there are famous scholars selling old books to make a living, and the lives of most writers are even more unstable and without warmth, so there is no possibility of developing their spiritual careers.

Originally, writers contribute spiritual food but also need spiritual comfort. But what old writers have received for years of cultivating and producing is only sympathetic sighs and mostly contempt, and they are not valued by the community. Speaking of this, I think of our some news agencies that have never been willing to release news of new works and whereabouts of famous writers, and I also think of our publishers, who rarely cooperate sincerely with cultural figures, but only treat writers as machines, without time for rest, or even the time for self-cultivation is deprived by the pressure of accelerated production.

This makes me think of the treatment of foreign writers. The government not only gives them the greatest honor but also a comfortable life, and the whereabouts of a writer are regarded by journalists as important as a government official. No wonder they have excellent works. But here, I have a thousand times more respect for some of our cultural figures who contribute their minds and energy while gasping under the heavy weight of life.

But from this, we must realize that rewarding cultural figures is an urgent matter. Although two or three cultural figures have received medals of victory, I think it should be given more widely. The government should also protect the lives of cultural figures and freedom of publication and should eliminate all obstacles to cultural progress. In order to obtain close contact with cultural figures, it is advisable to hold symposiums frequently and build museums of writers and cultural relics. If it is an author of reportage literature, he should be given free travel and convenience of observation everywhere.

These are easy for the government to do, greatly benefit cultural figures, and have a great impact on intellectuals among the people.

Editor's Note: After Mr. Zhang Daofan, Chairman of the Central Cultural Movement Committee, came to Shanghai, the cultural circles held a welcome party. Mr. Zhang also scheduled to invite cultural figures to a tea party again on the 27th of this month. It is hoped that such gatherings and other symposiums can be held at any time in the future so that the cultural circles can have an opportunity to exchange views on issues that are closely related to them.

### Mooring at Badong at Night

— Song Mu

When the boat stopped at Badong, it was already dusk. A layer of misty fog floated on the river, and the undulating mountains far and near lay in the darkness.

People were walking around in a noisy mess on the deck. The tea boy was shouting loudly. Around the ship's side, a lot of sampans gathered. Men and women were tripping over ropes and rolling up their sleeves, desperately climbing upwards. The sampans jumped up and down in the rapids like flipping somersaults.

The sailor with a yellow scar on the corner of his left eye was already dressed neatly, in a set of blue cloth jacket and trousers, washed stiffly. He must have put perfume on his hair. As he walked past, he brought a strong smell. He spotted me, so he lightly touched my elbow, sticking out his tongue.

"Hey, aren't you going ashore to open your eyes?"

I followed him ashore. There was a very long stone staircase from the wharf to the town. I don't remember how long it took to walk, but I felt that when I climbed to the top, I was already sweating all over.

The town was very bright. Oil lamps were hung high at the doors of the shops. There were especially many vendors. They may have been waiting for the convoys to make a night market, loudly greeting the passing pedestrians. The people who came down from the boat were all attracted by them in piles. Some were sitting at the noodle stalls along the street, eating midnight snacks. The aroma of beef whetted their appetites. Others were fiddling with some small antiques, flipping through old songbooks.

This is a very small county in western Hubei. In fact, the main street is only one. It can be walked through in a few minutes. But because it is the hub of the Sichuan-Hubei waterway, the market is usually quite prosperous. A lot of tung oil and bristles from Sichuan are transshipped here. When the water rises, the ships upstream and downstream often pass by here in an endless stream.

We were in a * corner when that sailor friend of mine who dressed up was attracted by a sound. I turned my head and could see that it was a woman wearing a tight-fitting jacket, with a round *, her hair slicked back with hair oil. The flat face of my sailor friend also seemed to brighten up. He grinned at the woman, making faces, and then turned to me.

"Hey, is she greeting me? Why don't you go in and have a cup of tea? I'll have her find you a cute little *..."

The woman's face seemed to flush. I shook my head. When I turned my eyes again, my sailor friend had already put his arm around the woman and disappeared into the stilt house.

I returned to the boat tiredly. The fog on the river was thicker. Someone was humming Peking opera in the cabin. It was already late at night. From the surrounding sampans, women hoarsely shouted:

"Selling yellow fruits! Selling yellow fruits!"

The voice sounded infinitely old and desolate.

### Genius and Hard Work

— Shu Kui

I often meet some young people. They often think they are very smart. They only need to read a book once; anything is easy to do.

But when I ask them about the books they have read, they can't tell me the essence of the books, and the things they do are not very good.

Why is this? This is because they think that there is nothing "difficult" for a genius, that they are a smart person, but in fact, they are the number one lazy bugs who have been poisoned by "genius".

Edison said! "Ninety-nine percent of the success of a career is hard work, and one percent is genius."

Yan Hui and Zilu were not smart, but they were the ones who transmitted the teachings of Confucius. This is because they put in hard work.

Everyone knows that Maupassant is the king of French short stories, but when he started writing novels, he listened to the teachings of his teacher Flaubert and first described the different faces of a hundred people.

O'Casey is a new-school playwright from Ireland, but his first part of the drama was rejected by the Abbey Theater. But he was not discouraged. He accepted the teachings of others, and eventually he succeeded.

Balzac, the most outstanding genius in realistic novels, said in his autobiography: "I often write my novels with fourteen hours of hard work a day, and only eat some boiled water and white bread."

The story of the tortoise and the hare race is not only a teaching material for elementary school students, but should be used to awaken everyone.

"Fists are never out of hand, and songs are never out of mouth"; a musician also practices instruments every day, and a painter does not separate from his brushes and palettes. I want to tell young people that the success of a career and the completion of studies do not depend entirely on genius, but on constant and arduous practice.

"As long as you put in the effort, you can grind an iron rod into a needle." It should be our best motto for learning. My ability to write this short article is the result of ten years of diligent reading.

### Education through Entertainment?

— Sun Jia

In Shanghai, some students hide in their mothers' arms and learn to pronounce unfamiliar words next to mahjong tables, and some college students gather to gamble on pai gow and study the changes in mathematics. It is felt that a large-scale "education through entertainment" movement is being promoted in the foreign settlement!

### Waste

— Jia Shui

The Continental Daily reported on November 17 that the four fake national universities and vocational schools in Beiping have a total of 5,000 students and half that number of teachers and administrative staff.

This means that there are 2,500 faculty and staff members. In other words, an average of two students is assigned to one faculty member or staff member.

How can so many be used?

I remember that before the war, the Ministry of Education sent personnel to inspect public and private universities in various places and made detailed reports upon their return. Among them, it was mentioned that a certain private university was quite good at saving money, had very few staff members, and had excellent efficiency. The accounts were clear and understandable throughout the years, and they never owed debts. However, a certain university had too many redundant personnel. The number of staff members was equal to the number of faculty members, and the salaries spent were also equal, becoming a huge expense that was a waste.

This is all waste.

The author of "The Story of Mankind," Van Loon, said in the preface to "The Story of the Bible" that there are two things he cannot tolerate, one of which is waste.

However, China, although poor, has many wasteful things. Is it only before the war? Is it only during the time of the fake government? Even now, we can still see the waste of money, the waste of manpower, and the waste of life.

For example, some schools are stagnant, some factories are taken over but not started, and a lot of money is spent on decorating the facade. These are all kinds of waste. We hope that all kinds of work can get on track and that the phenomenon of waste can be reduced and eliminated.

### The Value of an Old Sword

— Huang Wenjin

A friend, across the ocean, sent a letter from a place full of exotic charm. He said, in a crowd of strangers, how much a wanderer cherishes his old friends! When encountering difficult problems, he wants to find a close friend to seek answers from; however, looking around, he feels like a sailor on a ship, facing the sea alone, in deathly silence, coldness, and almost driven mad by the pain.

Indeed, when we are always surrounded by a group of familiar and happy friends, spending our days together in merriment, we do not easily appreciate the value of friendship. This is just like people in the city who are used to electric lights and do not feel the brightness of the lights. But, when we leave that intimate atmosphere and step into a new and incompatible environment, a feeling of loneliness immediately rises in the depths of our hearts.

Someone said that a sincere friend is like a reliable walking stick; although we may not lose him, few people deeply appreciate his value when they have him. However, when we need his help, we realize that an old friend and an old sword are the most reliable things in life. I think no one would deny this statement.

Therefore, anyone who lives in society should never tire of trying to find upright friends, from intimate ones to more distant acquaintances, letting friends introduce us to friends, in accordance with the principle of human interdependence.

### The Power of Emotion

— Zhu Yu

I just finished teaching my students "An Episode in the Wilderness" (a novel by Balzac), and the students don't seem to understand its meaning very well. The story is about an escaped French prisoner stranded in the Egyptian desert, who suddenly encounters a leopard; he tries every means to caress this ferocious beast, educating and subduing it with the greatest emotion; later, he even forms an invisible friendship with the leopard, and this desolate desert becomes a small paradise. What is the meaning of this?

Marlowe said: "Hell is other people." How can our human world be hell? Please think: How much warm emotion have we used in our lives? We often put on cold faces and use sharp claws to seize things that are beneficial to ourselves, regardless of others. If everyone is like this, the world will lose love, sympathy, mutual help, and understanding, leaving only selfishness, greed, plunder, and conflict—isn't this hell? To rebuild our paradise, we must spread the spring breeze of emotion everywhere.

Humans are not born good, nor are they born evil, but are like a blank canvas. Emotion is what God has given us, of utmost value. How can we lose it?

This is the truth. Transforming the environment doesn't require great achievements. As long as people treat each other with sincerity, exchange genuineness for falsehood, and exchange affection for malice, the distance between people will be shortened, and the warmth between people will be increased. First, build the fireside in each of our hearts, and paradise on earth will appear immediately.

The Earth will be destroyed if emotion ever disappears!

All sinful acts can be transformed by emotion. Even a soulless leopard can be moved by it, let alone humans? Oppression is futile. Let everyone show their true feelings, understand each other, and return to harmony.

### Brand

— Ji Wang

A brand, deeply imprinted in the depths of my heart.

Shame, trauma, anger, and hatred, these are indelible marks.

Having been subjected to inhumane beatings, waterboarding, forced confessions, and forced to write repentance letters and put my fingerprints on them, being at the mercy of others in a living hell, losing the ability to resist, I was simply like a living dead person. I was locked up for a few days, and then released.

Today, I am actually a "great citizen." The attitude that a "great citizen" should have is said to be forgiveness, tolerance, and not dwelling on the past. This is the virtue of our "great citizens." Alas! This is the sorrow of the "great citizen"!

Let this brand be forever engraved in the depths of my heart!

This is a wrongful conviction.

This is the sorrow of the "great citizen."

After the exchange rate between fabi and pseudo-lianchao was stipulated, Japanese gold prices soared. This is called "home flowers are not as fragrant as wild flowers."

### The Enemy (Part 5)

— Pearl S. Buck, translated by Zhu Qi

After agreeing, the two of them lifted the man up. He was very light, like a chicken that had been starving for a long time, with only feathers and bones left. They carried him, his hands hanging down, up the stairs, and into the side door of the house. Inside the door was a corridor, and at the end of the corridor, they carried him into an empty bedroom. This was originally Sadao's father's bedroom, and it had been empty since his death. They laid him down on the thickly matted floor. Everything in the room was Japanese-style, because the old gentleman had never been willing to sit on a chair or sleep on a foreign-style bed. Hana took out a soft quilt from the wall cupboard. She hesitated, it was a flower silk quilt with a pure white silk lining.

She said softly with hatred, "He's really dirty."

Sadao also said, "Yes, it's best to give him a bath first. You go get hot water, and I'll wash him."

She said, "You can't touch him. We need to tell the servants he's here first. I'll go tell Yumi now. She can leave the children for a while and come wash him."

Sadao thought for a moment and said, "Okay, you go tell Yumi, and I'll go tell the other servants."

But the ashen color on the man's unconscious face made him lean down to feel his pulse first. The pulse was weak, but still beating. He then pressed his hand against the man's cold chest. His heart was still beating.

Sadao murmured, "If we don't operate on him, he'll die, but I don't know if he'll die if we do."

Hana cried out in fear, "Don't save him! What good will it do if he lives?"

Sadao said, "What harm if he dies?" He stood looking at the still figure. This man must have extraordinary vitality, otherwise he would be dead by now. He's still very young—maybe not even twenty-five.
