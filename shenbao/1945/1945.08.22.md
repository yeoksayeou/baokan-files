Imai, formally dressed and wearing his military sword, disembarked first, looking sorrowful and silent. He was allowed to have his luggage inspected by our military police, and the Japanese aircraft engineer saluted Imai and asked for instructions on handling the luggage. At 12:30 PM, Major Chen led Imai and his seven staff members into the city by car. At that time, photographers took pictures one after another, and the situation was very tense.

Situation of Manila Talks; Representatives of Both Sides' Land and Sea Forces Held Separate Talks; Soviet General Staff Sends Representatives to the Philippines

Manila, 21st (Central News Agency, United Press dispatch) - The Manila Conference has ended. Speakers participating in the conference said: They deeply believe that the Japanese are indeed sincere and honest, and are striving to cooperate with the U.S. side. The two sides did not discuss the international situation, and did not mention the atomic bombs or other matters, except for mentioning the damage suffered by the Japanese mainland from U.S. bombing. According to a joint Manila dispatch from General MacArthur's headquarters to the Japanese General Headquarters, the Japanese surrender delegation left Manila after 1:00 PM (Japan time) on the 20th and returned to their country. Before they left, they had two talks with General MacArthur's Chief of Staff, which lasted for two and a half hours. General MacArthur himself did not attend. The ceremony was grand at the beginning of the meeting, and the meeting was divided into separate talks between representatives of the land, sea, and air forces of both sides.

Manila, 21st (Central News Agency dispatch) - The Japanese special envoys were very busy during their 20-hour stay in Manila.

The Japanese envoys arrived in the Philippines at 6:00 PM on the 19th and immediately entered the bullet-scarred city hall of General MacArthur's headquarters.

At 9:00 AM, the Japanese envoys rushed to the headquarters to hand over the certificate to General Sutherland, Chief of Staff of the Supreme Commander, and continued the talks of the previous night. Kawabe, the chief Japanese envoy, got off the plane first. He looked depressed and serious for most of the time he met with the Allied personnel, but he showed a slight ease during the discussion. Only when he heard the Allied plan to land on his homeland did he become unhappy again. Kawabe collaborated to provide MacArthur's staff with the information they needed, which was provided by representatives of the heads of the Japanese army, navy, and their air forces. Although Kawabe could speak a little English, he spoke in Japanese when speaking as a representative of the Japanese government, so someone was translating beside him. He gave the impression of a typical Japanese soldier. At the end of the talks, General Sutherland said to Kawabe, the chief Japanese envoy: "I thank you for your cooperation and hope you have a safe return to Tokyo." Kawabe replied: "I am deeply grateful for your concern for us. I express my heartfelt thanks for the scenery."

### British Army in Burma Distributes Leaflets Urging Japanese Troops to Surrender

Yangon, 20th - The British army in Burma has used every imaginable method to urge the enemy to surrender, but to no avail. To date, there is no indication that the enemy will surrender. It is unreasonable to say that the Japanese army is still unaware that their country has already surrendered. Yesterday, the British Air Force dropped tens of millions of leaflets on the east bank of the Xitang River. The leaflets were signed by the Commander-in-Chief of the British Indian Army in Burma. Britain demanded that the Japanese army send a special envoy to the Allied positions to formulate the details of the surrender. The Indian Brigade near Lisu on the canal between Bigu and Xitang River would fire leaflets at Japanese positions with earthen cannons. The cannons were filled with straw and leaflets, placed on small boats and pushed vigorously along the canal, and a large number of leaflets were scattered into the enemy's concealed positions and trenches. It is surprising that the Japanese army still does not know that their country has surrendered. Six Japanese soldiers captured near Narongri Village yesterday were unaware of the Emperor's surrender edict. Four Japanese soldiers captured near Donggua had not heard of this either.

### The United States Will Strengthen Control Over the Secrets of Atomic Bomb Manufacturing

He declined to comment on the details of the bill, but said that no matter what path the law takes, we can be sure that the discovery of the secret of launching atomic energy was successful with the money of the American people, so this secret belongs to all the American people and must be used to promote the happiness of all the American people. Thomas and the Department of the Army's bill will include all wartime and peacetime uses of the destructive power that led to Japan's surrender this time. Senator Mahani, another member of the Senate Military Affairs Committee, said that the government must also control the production of all radioactive ores that can split atoms.

### Civil Shipwreck; All Crew Members Were Rescued

Chongqing, 21st (Central News Agency dispatch) - The Minsheng Company's civil ship, on the 19th, sailing to Sandouping, shipwrecked due to encountering whirlpools near Liulinji (below Badong). The ship was a charter ship with a load capacity of 300 tons. It was carrying 1,200 government officials and public personnel this time, only about 50 tons, but because the hold was not loaded with goods, it was heavier on top and lighter on the bottom. When it reached Liulinji, it encountered a whirlpool, causing the rudder to fail. The ship gradually sank. Fortunately, the time taken was five hours, and all the personnel on board had been rescued, with only some items lost. The ship is still one-quarter above the water surface and can be salvaged when the water recedes.

### Guidance Committee of the Municipal Party's Labor Movement: A Message to Shanghai Workers

The Shanghai Municipal Party Committee's Guidance Committee for the Workers' Movement, which has led the city's laborers in their struggle against the enemy and puppets for the past eight years, now that victory has arrived, issues the following message to the workers of Shanghai:

Through Hardships and Dangers, Success Achieved

The eight-year War of Resistance has finally reached our predetermined goal – final victory. During this period, the people of the whole country have suffered the baptism of cruel artillery fire and endured the pain of displacement. Ultimately, relying on the unity and devotion of our national military and civilians, firmly believing in our principles, and under the leadership of Supreme Leader President Chiang and the established national policy, we have persevered unyieldingly, experiencing all kinds of hardships and dangers, and finally achieved success. The people of the whole country are encouraged by the restoration of peace, Chongqing has been revived, and from now on, we can live a stable life. We, the hard-working laborers, under the entire leadership and organization of our Party, have worked hard and diligently, performing the sacred mission. Now, after eight full years of hardship, and at this historic moment, in order to preserve our glorious history and strive for national economic recovery, and for the sake of the happiness of our laborers in the future, we must further strengthen our organization, consolidate our unity, and shoulder our new mission, in order to complete the important task of laborers dedicating themselves to national reconstruction.

Strive for Production, Restore the Economy

After this war, almost all industrial construction in various places has suffered great damage. In the world, we have already established ourselves as a major power, but economically, because we have always followed behind the great powers of the time, our budding industries still need to be cultivated. Therefore, in the statistics of the remaining various industries, this city occupies a considerably important position, and also has a considerable number of productive laborers. The victory of this great war has undoubtedly removed all kinds of shackles on industry, and future industrial development can undoubtedly proceed smoothly. However, the extent of damage to factory construction is also alarming. Therefore, if we want to strive for economic development and join the ranks of major powers, then our laborers, who possess great productive power, will undoubtedly directly shoulder this great mission. Now, we must first do our best to maintain the complete original industrial construction and various public utilities such as water, electricity, and transportation, so that they can continue to be used safely. From these remaining industries, we must strive to build and produce, and promote and develop them, so as to achieve the great goal of economic reconstruction of Shanghai.

Strengthen Organizations, Assist in Recovery and Prosperity

From today onwards, we must continue to consolidate the existing labor organizations. The comrades working under the Party's organization should assist in the smooth progress of the recovery work. After the success of the national liberation struggle, industrial construction and economic revival will undoubtedly be one of the future directions of our labor movement. Therefore, in the future, in addition to engaging in the liberation of our own lives, labor organizations should also make greater efforts under the major themes of national economic recovery and industrial construction, so that the major labor masses, under the entire leadership of the Party, can follow the correct path and accelerate the completion of our labor's new mission. The unfolding of a new history naturally requires our labor's new strength to shine and enrich it. Our labor class has already made great efforts in this national liberation struggle, but under the new environment, we naturally need to continue our labor to increase our labor's position in the construction of the new China, so as to maintain our glorious past.

### A Record of Consolation Visits to the Pudong Concentration Camp

— Zhang Zhongying

Four Long Years

Since the outbreak of the Pacific War, British and American expatriates in this city have been concentrated in Pudong, Yangshupu, and western Shanghai. During these four long years, given their usual comfortable lives and excellent environment in Shanghai, they inevitably felt some pain once they were interned. However, in fact, the treatment was acceptable, and it did not feel much different from the wartime life of ordinary soldiers.

However, it is human nature that when people have extreme freedom, they cannot appreciate the pain of being restricted. Conversely, once they are restricted, they feel the value of freedom. British and American expatriates were no exception during this period. Fortunately, they understood the current situation and were familiar with the trends of international warfare. Therefore, they were calm in their minds while in the camp. Watching the reflections across the river, although they had a sense of the past and present, they often felt the joy of the waxing and waning of life when strolling in the camp as the sun set and the moon rose.

Raising Funds for Consolation

Now that the war is over and peace is being rebuilt, British and American expatriates are waiting quietly to be released. Moreover, they have been detained for a long time, and they are even more in need of visits from outsiders. Dr. He Shizhen, a prominent figure in this city, was aware of this, and having studied in the United States in his early years and often socialized with British and American people after returning to China, he had deep feelings for them. He wanted to visit them, but was prevented by the circumstances and could not fulfill his wish. He often felt the sense of the wind and rain darkening, the monkeys chirping on the beams, and the falling moon. Now that the sky is clear and the rivers and mountains are about to return to their old appearance, he has organized a committee called the "International Friendship Association," with eleven members, including Zhang Shuping, Wang Renlin, Ai Guofan, Huang Youpeng, Zhang Qiangsheng, Ni Guangzu, and the author. He was publicly elected as the chairman, and Xie Xianyao of Jin Cheng Bank, Huang Nachuan of Daya Bank, and Liu Zhemin of Lianhua Bank were appointed as economic advisors. They began raising consolation funds from the previous period. Everything was ready by the day before yesterday. Yesterday, the committee members were divided and sent to various concentration camps with a letter of consolation signed by He to visit and express their condolences in person. The details of what happened are briefly described below, so that those in this city who are usually concerned about them can be comforted.

Details of Consolation Visits to Various Camps

Yesterday, there were originally three groups going to various concentration camps, but the author, Mr. Zhang Qiangsheng, and Jin Boming of Zhejiang Industrial Bank represented He to visit the Pudong camp to express their condolences.

At 2 p.m., we took a car to the Customs Wharf, and then took a small sampan to the other side. When we arrived at the shore, the consolers were already coming one after another. The three of us walked to the camp. The camp building was a three-story building with a large open space in the middle. Some people were shirtless, and some were wearing slippers and barefoot, creating a harmonious and relaxed atmosphere reminiscent of the countryside. On the second floor, we entered the office. The person in charge was Mr. Ayres, an Englishman. The American person in charge was originally Mr. Benoy, but he has resigned and was replaced by Mr. Brown. The three of us personally handed over a letter of consolation from He and gave them five checks, entrusting them to pass them on to the expatriates. Then, we expressed our condolences and were warmly received. We were then led to tour the entire camp. When the expatriates saw us, they came forward to shake hands and exchanged brief greetings. Then we went to the hall downstairs. At 4 p.m., we saw groups of people going to express their condolences, so we said goodbye and left.

Before leaving, Mr. Ayres and Mr. Brown asked us to convey their respect to Dr. He Shizhen and to tell the people in Puxi that they would return to the west bank within ten days and bow three times in admiration to the towering buildings on the other side of the river that were visible but unattainable, and to express their admiration to people from all walks of life on the sea.

Free Talk

### The Character of Free Talk

— Cheng

The character of Free Talk has been briefly explained in the editor's foreword: "To freely discuss what one thinks, sees, and hears, and it must be beneficial to the public." In other words, while discussion is free, it must be beneficial to the public, or at least have some beneficial effect on readers.

Therefore, we do not dislike incisive and sharp writing that criticizes reality. However, indiscriminate and abusive writing, and writing that only offers negative attacks without positive suggestions, is not acceptable.

Secondly, casual writing that only talks about romantic topics is certainly loved by some readers, but in the current tense era, in the current small space, it is temporarily difficult to publish. On the contrary, short essays with humor and enlightenment, and literary works with profound meaning, are all welcome.

Because after reading the contributions from readers in the past few days, I feel that some of them have not met our goals, so I reiterate the above, and hope that my fellow writers will pay attention.

### A Short History of "Free Talk"

— Chen Wei

This is a piece of exciting news—"Free Talk" has been relaunched! It has a long history in the history of vernacular literature.

It was once a venue for romantic talks of the Saturday School, and at another time a gathering place for concise and powerful "miscellaneous essays." In short, it is a supplement that has weathered many changes.

Based on available references, I will briefly discuss the history of "Free Talk":

"Free Talk" was first published on the first day of the seventh lunar month in the third year of the reign of Emperor Xuantong in the late Qing Dynasty, which corresponds to August 24, 1911 in the Gregorian calendar. It was initially edited by Wang Dungen, and the content consisted mainly of recreational texts for after-dinner enjoyment.

In March of the fourth year of the Republic of China, Wu Juemi took over as editor. He once briefly solicited poems and articles from military personnel to inspire a martial spirit among the people.

After exactly one year, Yao Changfu took over. This "supplement," the only one at the time, became a garden for members of the "Southern Society" to publish their poems and articles. In addition, a small garden called "Free Talk of Free Talk" was opened.

From the end of October in the fifth year of the Republic of China, Chen Xuyuan (also known as Tianxu Wosheng) took over the editorship. In addition to short essays, he also published some "family knowledge" that was popular with readers.

After the seventh year of the Republic of China, Tianxu Wosheng had become an industrialist, so Chen Lengxue edited it, focusing on short and concise essays.

From April 1, in the ninth year of the Republic of China, Zhou Shoujuan took over for twelve years. He published works that were very popular at the time, written entirely by famous literati in Shanghai. Looking at it now, it undoubtedly has the style of the Mandarin Ducks and Butterflies School. In the tenth year of the Republic of China, the content was divided into categories such as "Casual Talks," "Miscellanea," "News Gleanings," "Travel Notes," "Drama Talks," "Leftovers," and "Trifles." In addition, there were long serial novels and anecdotes about literary figures.

At the end of the twenty-first year of the Republic of China, Zhou edited a local supplement. At the beginning of the following year, in order to cater to the preferences of a certain group of readers, Zhou edited another supplement, "Spring and Autumn." The "Free Talk" section, however, underwent a sudden change, and was entirely written by promoters of new literature, truly marking the era when "Free Talk" shone brightly. The editor was Li Liewen, who had just returned from France and had new literary ideas. Regular contributors included Lu Xun, Yu Dafu, Cao Juren, Lao She, and others. At the same time, because of the emphasis on miscellaneous essays, many new writers were promoted, such as Kong Lingjing, Qian Xingcun, Shi Diancun, and Yong Tao. However, due to special circumstances, Lu Xun used many different pen names to submit articles, which can be found in the twentieth volume of his complete works.

Because the opinions were too radical, an announcement of "only talking about flowers, winds, and moonlight" had to be issued. The style gradually became bland, and then Zhang Zisheng took over the editorship until it was discontinued at the end of October of the twenty-fourth year. There were several intense debates, such as the problem of Zhuangzi as compulsory reading for students, the problem of the popular language, and the problem of humor, all of which were very famous and can be found in various collections of essays.

According to Hu Jiyuan's statistics, "Free Talk" lasted a total of twenty-four years and three months before the incident.

On the Double Tenth Festival in the twenty-seventh year of the Republic of China, "Shen Bao" was relaunched in Shanghai, and Wang Renshu edited "Free Talk," which still had the "Lu Xun style."

Soon after, Hu Shanyuan took over as editor. The writers were mostly young literati, such as Ding Di and Wen Zongshan, whose writing style was not as skilled as the previous ones.

After more than a year, Huang Jia edited it, publishing Western humorous essays and scientific interests, with a style completely like the "Western Wind" magazine.

It was discontinued on December 8 of the thirtieth year. It was relaunched again in the thirty-first year, paying close attention to social problems in Shanghai. The essays mostly published texts on youth cultivation.

In the thirty-second year, due to space constraints, this garden was moved to the relaunched "Shen Bao Monthly." The "Free Talk" in the monthly lacked the previous vigor.

Until now, starting on the 20th, "Free Talk" has been relaunched again. We hope that it can move forward diligently, reflecting the wheels of this era, and we hope even more that this historically long-standing supplement can exist forever.

### Dawn

— Lin Yi

The morning rooster has crowed, breaking the clear dawn,

Ten thousand creatures awaken from their slumber.

A round of morning glow,

Breaks through the overcast sky;

It is dancing, it is rejoicing, it is new life, it is vitality.

Look at the faint morning light!

Humanity once again steps forward with joyous steps,

Embarking on the journey to a new era.
