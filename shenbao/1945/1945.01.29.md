### Japan's Economic Policies Towards China: Converting Resources into War Power; Foreign Minister Shigemitsu Elucidates Various Sino-Japanese Issues

Tokyo, 28th (Central News Agency Telegram) – Regarding various East Asian issues, the key questions between the Diet and the government are summarized as follows: (1) Foreign Minister Shigemitsu, in his diplomatic address to both houses of the Diet on the first day of its reconvening, forcefully stated, "The Greater East Asia War began with the China problem and will end with the China problem." Consequently, during the budget committee session in the House of Representatives on the 23rd, Mr. Takeyo Nakatani and Foreign Minister Shigemitsu engaged in a question-and-answer session centered on this speech, as follows: Mr. Nakatani asked: "The coordination of Sino-Japanese relations is the path to completing the Greater East Asia War. What does the Foreign Minister mean by 'The Greater East Asia War began with the China problem and will end with the China problem'?"

Coordination of Sino-Japanese Relations Stabilizes East Asia

Foreign Minister Shigemitsu replied: "If the people of East Asia can fully understand the spirit of the Greater East Asia Declaration, and if China can return to the righteousness of East Asia, then stability in East Asia can be achieved. This is the true meaning of solving the China problem. However, what hinders Chongqing's return to East Asia is the American influence in China. It is essential to destroy American long-term strategic influence in Asia, both militarily and politically. When China returns to East Asia, the war aims of the Japanese army can be achieved, and the purpose of the Greater East Asia Declaration can be manifested." Mr. Nakatani asked: "The discord between Chongqing and the Chinese Communist Party is intensifying. If we abandon the formal attitude of addressing the issues between the National Government and Chongqing and adopt a proactive policy, what is the Foreign Minister's opinion?" The Foreign Minister replied: "Speaking directly about the Chongqing issue, the Chinese people should take the lead in treating it as an internal Chinese problem. If Japan consistently promotes policies thoroughly based on the spirit of the Greater East Asia Declaration, aiming to restore the Chinese spirit, it will be very easy to find a path to peace among the Chinese people. From Japan's standpoint, we should also thoroughly promote policies for peace. Therefore, when the Nanjing government was established under the leadership of Chairman Chen Gongbo, who inherited the legacy of Sun Yat-sen, it also called for overall peace, based on Pan-Asianism. Chen Gongbo, who inherited his legacy, still passionately strives to save China with this great spirit, and we are willing to advance policies with all our assistance."

War Spirit Reaches its Peak, Policies Proceed Smoothly

Mr. Nakatani asked: "The rapid conversion of resources on the Chinese mainland into war power is an urgent task. Are there any contradictions between the key objectives of the decisive battle and diplomatic considerations?" The Foreign Minister replied: "Sino-Japanese relations are determined by the Sino-Japanese Alliance. China, as a member of the participating nations, consistently strives to complete the war and cooperates with Japan, primarily through material cooperation. It makes a great contribution to Japan's completion of the war. There is no contradiction in this regard, nor is there any contradiction in the overall situation. Everything is proceeding smoothly. I consistently hope to smoothly advance the operation and implementation of the new policy towards China." Mr. Nakatani asked: "The Greater East Asia War is essentially a war for the liberation of Asia. To bring the war spirit of all Asian peoples to its peak, it is necessary to launch an Asian national movement centered on China and Japan." State Minister Ogata replied: "The national movement has a great mission in the construction of Greater East Asia, and the General Headquarters for Asia will certainly be able to complete this mission."

Purchasing Supplies to Contribute to the War

Defense Minister Yoshida, Transportation Minister Maeda, and Greater East Asia Minister Shigemitsu, regarding the "urgent task of rapidly converting resources on the Chinese mainland into war power," answered questions from Mr. Ko Tanaka during the House of Representatives budget committee session on the 23rd. They also explained the actual situation of purchasing and transporting materials locally, and how local production efforts are converting resources into war power. Greater East Asia Minister Shigemitsu replied that purchasing Chinese materials naturally has a significant relationship with Japan's war power, so we must engage in purchasing as much as possible. Currently, we are implementing purchases using Chinese currency, but we must also fully consider the wartime currency inflation and the rise in commodity prices. Regarding this point, we are currently vigorously assisting China's policies, with the goal of smoothly promoting cooperation between China and Japan. Regarding economic cooperation on this point, there are concrete plans for purchasing methods and purchasing institutions, and these policies are being gradually implemented. This smooth progress of economic cooperation between China and Japan is the realization of the new policy towards China.

British and American Interference is Clearly Evidenced

Foreign Minister Shigemitsu, during the House of Representatives budget general committee session on the 20th, responding to a question from Mr. Masamichi Rōsōyama regarding the direction of diplomatic operations, stated that Chongqing's implementation of constitutional government is evidence of British and American interference in Chongqing's internal affairs. The gist of the question-and-answer session on that day is as follows: Mr. Rōsōyama asked, "What about the issue of Chongqing implementing constitutional government?" Greater East Asia Minister and Foreign Minister Shigemitsu replied, "Chiang Kai-shek stated in his New Year's address that he would implement constitutional government soon. However, Britain, America, and others have attacked the existing one-party dictatorship as authoritarian, and therefore demanded that he implement democratic politics. This is ostensibly to facilitate a compromise between the Yan'an and Chongqing regimes. This is concrete evidence of the British and American governments interfering in Chongqing's internal affairs. Righteous people in our country must be outraged by this outrageous interference." Mr. Rōsōyama asked, "I would like to hear about concrete measures for uniting the people of Greater East Asia. Philippine Ambassador Vargas has proposed establishing a Greater East Asia Headquarters in Tokyo. What does the government think about this?" The Greater East Asia Minister replied, "The Greater East Asia Declaration is the common opinion of the countries of Greater East Asia, and it is natural to further study policies for the group of Greater East Asia."

No Intention to Change Currency Exchange Rates

Finance Minister Ishiwata attended the House of Representatives committee on the 24th, and a member asked, "Does the government have any plans to change the currency exchange rates within the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere?" He replied, "Within the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, the gold standard will not be used even after the war. The gist is as follows: If the exchange rates within the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere are managed according to old ideas, they would have to be changed once commodity prices increase. However, the government has no intention of changing them."

### Minister Horinouchi and Others Return to Japan to Discuss Concrete Policies to be Decided Soon

Nanjing, 28th (Central News Agency Telegram) – Since our country joined the war, in order to stabilize the people's livelihood and ensure military needs, we resolutely implemented a controlled economic policy, aiming to establish a wartime economic system and enhance the overall power for the decisive battle, in order to complete the Greater East Asia War. For two years, the entire country has been working together to promote this goal. However, due to various environmental difficulties, there has been no significant increase in domestic material production, and the prices of various commodities have risen incessantly. The national economy is becoming increasingly difficult, and the people's livelihood is becoming increasingly impoverished. As the Greater East Asia War has entered its final decisive stage, the economic system urgently needs to be further strengthened. Regarding this matter, the National Government authorities are currently actively considering it. At the same time, allied countries have also expressed their willingness to assist with all their strength. During the 86th session of the Japanese Diet, Foreign Minister Shigemitsu stated in response to questions from members of the House of Representatives: "Improving China's economic poverty is currently under consideration with new economic countermeasures." Based on the above intention, the military and embassy authorities of allied countries stationed in China are closely discussing the implementation details of these countermeasures. It is understood that Japanese Ambassador Horinouchi and Councilor Tosaki of the Shanghai office have jointly returned to Japan. In addition, the information department chief will also depart to discuss this issue in detail. This is of profound relevance to the future of the Greater East Asia War and is unanimously watched by our country's public and private sectors. The deeply awaited new economic countermeasures towards China will soon have a concrete formal decision.

### Japanese House of Peers Opens Yesterday: Plenary Session

Additional Military Spending Bill Passed

Tokyo, 28th (Central News Agency Telegram) – The Japanese House of Peers convened a plenary session at 10:00 AM today. First, they discussed the supplementary budget bill for temporary military expenditures, which was passed unanimously. With this, the 85 billion yen temporary military expenditure budget bill was enacted. Subsequently, six bills sent by the House of Representatives, including the bill on issuing public bonds for the next fiscal year, were presented with their justifications and handed over to a special committee. The House of Representatives today held budget committee and special committee meetings.

### Rapid Increase in Liquid Fuel Production

Tokyo, 28th (Central News Agency Telegram) – During the fourth subcommittee session of the House of Representatives budget committee on the 28th, Mr. Kazuo Katayama raised questions from various angles regarding the important issue of securing liquid fuel. Defense Minister Yoshida, Parliamentary Vice-Minister of Munitions Matsumura, and Director of the Fuel Bureau Namba provided detailed answers as follows: (1) "Under the wartime situation of rapid increase in production and self-sufficiency, dependence on crude oil from the South will become increasingly difficult in the future. However, we will strive to transport crude oil to the extent possible. Regarding the resolution of alcohol fuel production based on tubers centered on sweet potatoes in Manchuria, we increasingly feel its great mission. Also, the hope for increasing domestic crude oil production is extremely high, and it is being realized step by step. With the continuous supply of such aircraft fuel crude oil, artificial alcohol, and pine oil, it is expected that there will be no shortage in completing the war. (2) "Oil field development" We are currently developing promising new oil fields. (3) "Synthetic petroleum" Currently, the only effect of increasing production in sight. (4) "Manchurian Alcohol" Concretely decided through consultation with Manchuria.

Travelogue

### From Nanjing to Zhenjiang

— Special Correspondent of this Newspaper: Dan Ming

On the 24th of January, at half-past six in the morning, I set off from the central district of the capital city while the sky was still dim, taking a carriage to Xiaguan. The "Journey to Northern Jiangsu" that I had planned was starting today. Passing through Yijiang Gate, everyone was supposed to get out of the carriage for the police and military police to check their papers. However, there were several solo traders in the carriage, who were "relatives" of those uniformed comrades, so we all benefited from their connections.

A Scene at the Train Station

Arriving at the train station, it was still very early. Looking at my watch, I realized it was only 7:15. So, our group of travelers waited in front of the station gate. At 7:30, the iron gate was opened wide, and the passengers surged in. Most of them hadn't bought tickets, and the scene became bustling with activity. At the same time, the "black hats," those who scalp tickets on the black market, also became very active.

"Sir, where are you going? Do you have a ticket?"

"It's too crowded…please add a few hundred yuan!"

Such voices kept passing by my ears. Fortunately, I had already bought a ticket at the travel agency, so I had nothing to do with them. I heard from my fellow travelers that some of them were also going to Zhenjiang. However, the second-class fare was originally only 900 yuan, but when they squeezed to the ticket window, the ticket seller would only give you a ticket if you gave him 1,000 yuan. How could the travelers who were leaving argue with him over 100 yuan? I never expected that the ticket sellers at the capital's train station would be so corrupt!

The capital's train station is just like the train stations in other places. It doesn't provide convenience for passengers, because only in this way will passengers buy black market tickets and pay the "black hats" to be at the front of the line. It's strange that even though the express train clearly doesn't have third-class seats, they insist on having second-class passengers line up at the third-class ticket checking point. Many people who arrived early had been standing in a very long line at the second-class ticket checking point. However, just as they were about to check their tickets, a "black hat" would come up and take down the "Second Class" sign, and then rehang it at the third-class ticket checking point. As a result, people became crowded and the order was disrupted. Although traffic police had maintained order when people were lining up, it was obviously impossible to maintain order at this point. What's particularly absurd is that when second-class passengers were lined up in two lines at the third-class ticket checking point, one line was bound to be sacrificed due to the ticket checker's ulterior motives. Because after the ticket checker checked the tickets of a few "customers" he had lined up, he stopped checking the tickets by placing an iron bar horizontally, and the passengers in the line had no choice but to switch to another line. Those who didn't have time to squeeze in had to ask others to help them find a solution! In the past, only the selling of military tickets was stopped, but now there's a new trick of stopping the checking of tickets. I wonder if the Hua Zhong Railway Company authorities, who are in the process of rectifying corruption, have noticed this?

A Glimpse of Zhenjiang

The train arrived in Zhenjiang after ten o'clock. It's a long way from the train station to the county government. Coming out of Junzhan Road, we first passed through Saigaishan Road, then Baogaishan Road to Xinma Road, and Shuangjing Road and Zhongshan Road, before the carriage finally stopped in front of the county government on Shengfu Road. The street scene in the mud has a unique style. The current county government area is the former Jiangsu provincial government before the incident. The place where the provincial chairman worked at that time - a western-style building - has now become the administrative inspectorate of the Fourth District of Jiangsu. The county government is located in the former civil affairs hall of the provincial government. It is said that it has been renovated since County Magistrate Huang Xianggu took office. Unfortunately, County Magistrate Huang was not in Zhenjiang today, so I talked with the county government secretary, Mr. Pan Qixuan, for a long time. Mr. Pan was originally the director of the Yucai Division of the Ministry of Personnel of the National Government, and only came to Zhenjiang on leave to temporarily take on this job after County Magistrate Huang sincerely asked for help.

After an earnest conversation, I learned that Mr. Pan was a top student of Kang Youwei. He has recently traveled to various places in North and Northern Jiangsu, and has unique insights into the county administration of various places. No wonder County Magistrate Huang can be respected by the local people with such an outstanding staff member. Zhenjiang County is divided into seven districts, with a population of more than 200,000, but there are no accurate statistics. There are only five secondary schools, including the provincial No. 10 Middle School, Zhenjiang County Middle School (junior high school), private Chengzhi Middle School, Dongjin Middle School, and Dacheng Middle School (junior high school). Therefore, the education system can be said to be undeveloped, which can be described as a world of difference compared to before the incident! In particular, among the middle schools here, only the private Chengzhi Middle School offers courses up to the third grade of senior high school, and the provincial No. 10 Middle School only offers courses up to the first grade of senior high school!

There is only one Zhenjiang Daily here, and it is only a small sheet with eight openings a day. Compared with Suzhou and Hangzhou, it is also far behind, and the cultural backwardness can be known! The only better cinema is the Zhonghua Cinema, which is directly under the Zhonghua Film Company. It is screened in a loop from 6:00 pm, and is currently showing "Ju Hai Qing Tao".

High Commodity Prices

Walking along West Gate Street (this is the most lively street in Zhenjiang, now renamed Qingxiang Road), the sidewalks on both sides are full of temporary markets for solo traders, where stalls are clustered, mostly selling cigarettes, matches and fabrics. As for the general commodity prices here, they are quite alarming, or equivalent to Shanghai. The best Jinshan Hotel, although not as good as a second-class hotel in Shanghai, costs two or three thousand yuan a day. If you eat in a restaurant every time, you will have to spend at least 10,000 yuan a day. The high commodity prices in major cities along the Nanjing-Shanghai line in our country are really an obstacle to the future of construction and revival!

Walking east from Qingxiang Road and turning from Baota Road, you can see banks standing, such as the Central Reserve Bank, the Jiangsu Local Bank, the Bank of Communications, and other local small banks. It can be said that it is "Zhenjiang's Wall Street".

In Zhenjiang, I gained a lot of living materials in one day, especially knowing a lot about the advantages and disadvantages of county-level political organs. The reason why it was difficult for local officials to have outstanding achievements in the past lies in: First, the power of the county magistrate is not necessarily concentrated. Even if he wants to do a good job, it is questionable whether the security team and the police bureau can also take a consistent attitude. Second, the county government's funding is too small. For example, Zhenjiang only has 170,000 yuan of funding per month. In fact, the staff has to be subsidized and the local garrison has to be supplied. Each month costs at least several million yuan. May I ask what other way is there for a county magistrate who doesn't think of other ways? Third, some county magistrates in the past relied on their background and acted illegally, and the result was at most dismissal. The superior organs lacked the determination to rigorously rectify.

Editorial

### Expectations of the School Authorities

The opening date for the next semester for various schools in this city is approaching in an instant. Parents of students who have not yet paid their tuition fees are anxiously preparing. Although the amount of tuition fees charged by private schools has been revised by the education authorities and the collection standard has been increased by one-fold compared to the last announcement, some schools have in fact failed to collect according to the standard. As a result, parents of students from poor families feel even more difficult to raise funds, and suffer the pain of helplessly watching their children lose their schooling opportunities.

The reason why some private schools have failed to collect tuition fees according to the standard is nothing more than that this standard cannot maintain school expenses. Before the authorities can fully allocate daily necessities to teachers and staff, and before they can fully approve subsidies, it is impossible to comply with the standard in fact. Otherwise, there is only one way to stop running the school. Objectively speaking, some private schools in this city that have performed better in the past have indeed given teachers and staff higher salaries than average, so the level of teachers is also higher than average. Originally, excellent teachers, with relatively stable salaries, can conscientiously teach and achieve excellent results. These schools, upholding the principle of "genuine goods at a fair price", conscientiously teach on the one hand and increase tuition fees according to actual expenses on the other.

When the education authorities stipulated the fee standard, they took into account the burden of general poor families, trembled about the future of education, and made a decision after careful consideration. Therefore, charging fees according to the official standard is still a public decree, and it is necessary to comply with it in order to maintain the credibility of the public decree. However, it is also a fact that some schools cannot charge fees according to the official standard, and they ask for accommodation in order to take care of the facts. This is a complex aspect of the current education problem in this city. In principle, we of course advocate maintaining public orders, but at the same time, we cannot but consider the facts for some schools with special achievements.

We believe that the tuition fee collection standard is not a matter that has a direct relationship between the education authorities and the school authorities. In fact, it is a matter between students and teachers, because teachers educate students and students reward teachers. Both education and school authorities are in the middle position only. According to this, if the teacher's educational efforts on the students is 100%, then the students should also reward the teachers with 100%, which is reasonable. If the students reward the teachers with 100%, and the teachers only get 50%, or the teachers' educational efforts on the students is only 50%, in this comparison, the difference is obtained by the school authorities, which is unreasonable, and the education authorities should correct it in the supervisory position.

On the other hand, the education authorities, school authorities, and teaching staff are standing on the same position under the premise of "serving education". Therefore, they have the same responsibility for how to teach seriously and how to reduce the loss of schooling opportunities. If under such a common premise, there will be no conflicting opinions on the tuition fee collection standard.

Now that some schools believe that it is impossible to charge fees according to the standard in fact, then we put forward two points, and we hope that the school authorities must evaluate them:

(1) Set up free or reduced fee quotas to accommodate as many poor students as possible. We believe that this point must be fully achieved by schools that follow any tuition fee collection standard, especially schools that have achieved results and believe that they cannot charge fees according to the official standard. The higher the tuition fee, the more difficult it is for poor outstanding students to enter school, and the school should give special consideration to this, and give as much reduction and free opportunities as possible, so that they can continue their studies.

(2) The economy is absolutely transparent, and all schools that follow any tuition fee collection standard must do it. If there is an existing school board, the school board should be responsible for supervision. If there is no school board or the school board is not sound, a joint audit committee should be organized by full-time teachers to audit and supervise. Especially those schools that hold that they cannot charge fees according to the official standard should take the initiative to do so first. If this point is concealed, we believe that there is absolutely no reason.

The above two points have already been clearly stipulated in Items 4 and 5 of the supplementary measures announced by the Education Bureau. All schools that believe that it is impossible to charge fees according to the official standard should fully achieve this in order to gain the trust of the society and the parents of students. If these two points cannot be effectively achieved, then the education authorities should interfere and correct them.

### Fierce Fighting by Japanese Troops on Luzon Island to Block Enemy's Attempt to Advance Southward; Many Enemy Ships Sunk and Destroyed in Lingayen Gulf

Tokyo, 27th (Central News Agency dispatch) – In the Lingayen Gulf area, from the 18th to the 24th, the enemy forces increased by another one or two divisions, bringing the total enemy troop strength to six or seven divisions. There have been no major changes in the battles in the eastern Anping area. Japanese troops are still firmly defending the first line of defense that links Damortes-Santo Tomas eastward to the Cabaruan Mountains. The enemy forces have been slow to make progress in front of this line of defense. Furthermore, the enemy once invaded the area near Pozorrubio, between the first and second lines of Japanese defense. After the Japanese forces launched a determined assault and concentrated artillery fire, the enemy's momentum has been halted. Meanwhile, a portion of the enemy forces that gradually infiltrated the eastern side of the Cabaruan Mountains has now invaded the area in front of San Manuel and the Daxin'gan area south of it. The enemy forces advancing southward from the Lingayen area are gradually expanding their power southward. On the evening of the 24th, 200 enemy soldiers advanced to the vicinity of Mabalacat and Clark Airfield.

Tokyo, 27th (Central News Agency dispatch) – In the Philippine Sea area this week, enemy transport convoys have again been active in the Surigao Strait, the Mindanao Sea, the Sulu Sea, and the waters around Mindoro Island. Their activities are primarily focused on linking landing points in Leyte, Mindoro, and Lingayen, and they are aggressively seeking to replenish troops and supplies, or to rapidly construct offensive bases. At the same time, small units of enemy naval vessels appeared on the 21st off the coast of Laoag Currega in northwestern Luzon, and shelled the land. Enemy torpedoes, seaplanes, etc. also launched continuous attacks. In addition, enemy mobile forces used their carrier-based aircraft to attack various islands at the southwestern tip of Taiwan in South China and Annam, attempting to contain the Japanese forces' operations in the Philippines and to control future rear supply lines. Conversely, Japanese kamikaze special attack units and air force units have launched successive attacks. On the 21st and 23rd, three aircraft carriers, one cruiser, and three vessels of unknown type were bombed and burned in the seas east of Taiwan. Furthermore, on the 24th and 25th, enemy warships in Lingayen Gulf were bombed, resulting in the destruction of one enemy battleship, one battleship or cruiser, two destroyers, and one transport ship. In addition, Japanese submarines operating in the southern Philippines used torpedoes to hit several enemy aircraft carriers, transport ships, etc. on the 24th, and are continuing to fight fiercely. Enemy carrier-based aircraft have launched very few air raids on Luzon Island, but attacks by land-based aircraft have been active.

### War Situation in Various Parts of Greater East Asia in the Past Week; Japanese Forces Continue to Fight Fiercely in Burma

Tokyo, 28th (Central News Agency dispatch) – A record of the war situation in Greater East Asia over the past week:

Japan Proper:

There has been little recent activity by the U.S. Air Force stationed in Chongqing in the Chengdu area. Around 110 enemy B-29 aircraft flew from Mariana Island bases. On the 23rd, more than 70 of them attacked Nagoya. Japanese forces intercepted them, shooting down 13 and destroying approximately 50. It is expected that enemy air raids on Japan proper will intensify in coordination with operations in the Philippines. More than 70 aircraft also attacked Tokyo on the 27th.

Central Pacific:

In the Central Pacific area, enemy aircraft have been persistently attacking the Ogasawara Islands and Iwo Jima, with about 20 to 40 aircraft at a time.

Burma:

In the "Nujiang River Area," the Yunnan Expeditionary Force is attempting to open the China-India Highway, attacking Wanting with eight divisions and Namhkam with two divisions. On the 18th, a portion of the Chongqing army invaded the Wanting area. A portion of the Japanese forces launched a bold counterattack and fierce fighting is still ongoing. On the 17th, near Nanbeijia in the area between Wanting and Xucheng, approximately 500 troops from a joint Chongqing-U.S. airlift unit landed. Japanese forces in the area immediately surrounded them and are currently continuing to mop them up. In the "Western Irrawaddy Area," the main force of the newly formed 1st Army 50th Division and the British-Indian 30th Division is advancing southward towards Monywa (approximately 150 kilometers northeast of Mandalay), apparently attempting to cut off the Lashio-Mandalay highway. In the northern Mandalay area, the Chongqing Army's 19th Division and a portion of the British-Indian 36th Division have crossed the Irrawaddy River at two locations, attempting to advance towards the eastern bank. Japanese forces are currently engaged in fierce fighting in this area.

### Municipal Police Bureau Reforms Patrol Methods; Arrests of Criminals to Be Executed with Police Assistance

The Municipal Police Bureau, in order to eliminate corruption among patrol officers and rectify police discipline, has reformed patrol methods. The key points of the methods are as follows: (1) Reduce Posts: Review the importance of the original posts, reducing them to the necessary minimum, with half of the original number as the standard. (2) Reserve Officers: Half of the officers other than those on duty should remain at the branch office to await dispatch, but in branch offices with fewer officers, less than half may remain. (3) Post Rotation Time: The standard post time is two hours, but for special locations and nighttime duties, it may be determined according to the specific circumstances of each branch office, but should not exceed four hours. (4) Utilization of Baojia Self-Defense Corps: In order to reduce the number of patrol officers, in addition to utilizing reserve officers for assistance, attention must also be paid to utilizing the Self-Defense Corps, implementing Self-Defense Corps patrols in addition to duty posts, to cultivate their spirit of self-defense.

The Municipal Police Bureau is vigorously promoting police administration in order to effectively maintain local security, and the treatment of police officers will also be adjusted and improved starting next month. However, it has been found that other agencies, when searching for or arresting criminals or illegal elements in the urban area, often act alone, leading to misunderstandings. Therefore, the Bureau has notified all relevant agencies that in the future, when searching for or arresting criminals in the urban area, they should notify the Bureau or the relevant branch office in advance, and officers will be dispatched to assist in the execution.

### Financial Fluctuations Reoccur in the City Last Week; Banks and Native Banks Lack Cash Funds

Due to the influence of international winds and rumors, the financial and industrial conditions in the city have been affected in the past week. Ignorant businessmen have been incited to use their available funds to engage in activities in the market, causing financial fluctuations to reoccur. The first half of the week was relatively stable, but in the second half, the rising trend intensified. In the black market, gold prices rose by more than 20%, and the trend of hoarding became prominent. Sycee silver also exceeded the 1,000 yuan mark. Chinese stocks were also firm at the same time, and the popular stocks all rose sharply, with the trading volume increasing significantly compared to the previous week. Banks and native banks lacked cash funds, and merchants and residents also felt a shortage of cash. In order to adjust the capital use of customers, all withdrawals exceeding 50,000 yuan were made with bank transfer orders (i.e., check), to facilitate adjustment needs. At the same time, in view of this situation, the Central Reserve Bank decided to issue new 500-yuan and 10-yuan notes from now on to regulate market demand. It is expected that the past situation of cash shortage can be resolved. As for the interbank lending rate within the past week, the explicit rate remained unchanged, while the implicit rate increased slightly.

### Zhang Beisheng Discusses the Situation of Clearing Villages in Northern Jiangsu

Zhang Beisheng, the Inspector of Clearing Villages in Northern Jiangsu, recently arrived in Shanghai on official business and stayed for a while. In order to understand the general situation in Northern Jiangsu after the implementation of the Clearing Villages policy, a Central News Agency reporter visited Mr. Zhang at his residence. Mr. Zhang said that since the National Government explicitly ordered the first phase of Clearing Villages, he has been responsible for the Clearing Villages work. Until the Clearing Villages in Northern Jiangsu began the previous year, he was responsible for the Treasure of Clearing Villages in Northern Jiangsu. Northern Jiangsu suffered from the Communist Party in the 18th and 19th years of the Republic of China. After the incident, the New Fourth Army and others committed evil deeds, causing the people's livelihood to suffer a major threat, and the promotion of politics was also difficult. Since the implementation of Clearing Villages in April of the previous year, the main force of the New Fourth Army collapsed, and it is not difficult to eliminate the small number of militiamen and other New Fourth Army who remain. Former Chairman Zeng said, "Clearing Villages must first clear the heart." After Clearing Villages, the reason why general politics cannot be clearly expected is that the target of Clearing Villages is superficially the New Fourth Army, but in reality, it is corrupt officials and corrupt officials. If corrupt officials and corrupt officials are not清清 cleared, it is difficult for politics to be clear. In order to clarify corrupt officials and corrupt officials, it is necessary to improve the living conditions of civil servants. Therefore, in Northern Jiangsu, we first advocated the system of paying land tax in kind, so that the basic life of civil servants is satisfied, and they will not seek personal gain and extort. At the same time, we reformed illegal donations and taxes, reducing the burden on the people. The more transparent situation in Northern Jiangsu is the success of the system of changing land tax to in-kind payment.

### Nanyang Middle School Students Propose to Organize a "Middle School Fellowship" to Regularly Promote Scholarship Movement

This newspaper received a letter from the "Four Education Fellowship" of Nanyang Middle School yesterday, which stated: "Gentlemen, we, the students of Nanyang Middle School, first raised the banner of student scholarship, and it really received a huge response. Now that the scholarship movement is coming to an end, we are going to "do it again."

This time, the Nanzhong Fellowship, which belongs to the Youth Association's youth department, launched the fundraising campaign, and received enthusiastic support from the students. The goal was achieved in ten days. We are still willing to be a brick to attract jade, hoping that all fellowships will respond. Although donors for this scholarship are exceptionally enthusiastic, the distance from the goal is still far, probably because fundraising is not conducted regularly. Therefore, we propose to combine the students who receive scholarships from various middle schools into a fellowship. On the one hand, we will seek the development of the students' collective intelligence, physical fitness, spirit and society. On the other hand, we will regularly plan and raise scholarship funds. This is just our opinion. As for specific methods, etc., it is up to the gentlemen who care about the scholarship movement to refer to."

(Note) We are very grateful to the gentlemen of the Four Education Fellowship of Nanyang Middle School for their enthusiasm in supporting our scholarship movement! We also sympathize with the fact that you propose that the students who receive scholarships from various middle schools form a fellowship. On the one hand, we will seek the development of the students' physical, intellectual, social and moral education. On the other hand, we will regularly promote the scholarship fund. If our newspaper's university student fellowship is established first, and the middle school student fellowship is established later, the organization is very strong when they are linked together, and it can exert a great force. Now that the school year is starting, prepare slowly, and please wait and see!

Lucky Money Coupons to Be Used to Raise Scholarships

The Shanghai Department Store wrote in a letter: "In our country's old customs, every Lunar New Year, relatives and friends give children lucky money to show friendship and encourage children, which is not too critical. However, in recent years, prices have risen sharply, and the amount of this lucky money has also doubled, often in the thousands, which is not a small amount. And during the New Year, there are street vendors lining the streets, and gambling is rampant. Children are ignorant, and they all cherish their lucky money, playing happily in the vendor's array, or buying and eating indiscriminately, which damages their gastrointestinal tract, or buying firecrackers and throwing them away, causing trouble, or even participating in gambling, developing greedy habits. What was originally intended to love them is just enough to harm them. In view of this, our company is issuing lucky money coupons, which can be redeemed for any daily necessities at any time. Our company will also donate 11% of the total amount of coupons sold to the Shen Xin Scholarship Fund, so that poor children can benefit from the tithe, save unnecessary waste, and use it for legitimate needs."

(Attached method for issuing lucky money coupons)

(1) Sales start today, (2) The face value of the coupons is divided into 200, 500, 1,000, 2,000, 5,000, and one miao; (3) They can be fully redeemed for goods for an unlimited period; (4) 10% of the total amount of coupons sold will be donated to the Shen Xin Scholarship Fund.
