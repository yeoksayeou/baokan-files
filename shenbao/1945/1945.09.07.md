It is also heard that the Japanese side has also decided to send a honor guard to the airport to respectfully welcome General Tang upon his arrival, in order to show their respect. The person in charge convened a cadre meeting to discuss all matters related to welcoming General Tang. After the meeting, the Japanese side was notified of General Tang's arrival in Shanghai, so that they could make all necessary preparations. Representatives from all walks of life in Shanghai will go to the airport to welcome him today. The National Army, which will continue to fly to Shanghai today, will be the 362nd Regiment and the 363rd Regiment, led by their respective regimental commanders, Chen Xin, and Xiao Qi. Commander of the 49th Army, Mou Yanfang, will also fly to Shanghai today. A brief biography of General Tang is recorded below:

General Tang is a native of Yiwu, Zhejiang. He is 46 years old this year. He graduated from the Japanese Military Academy. He has served as the commander of the 89th Division and the commander of the 13th Army. Before the July 7th Incident, he participated in the Battle of Bailing, which made him famous throughout the country. After the outbreak of the War of Resistance Against Japan, General Tang led a division to firmly defend Nankou. He took the lead in resisting the enemy with blood and gave the enemy a heavy blow. In the 28th year of the Republic [1939], he was appointed commander-in-chief of the 31st Army Group. He participated in the Battle of Northern Hubei and defended Guiyang. He was then ordered to establish the Guilin-Hunan Area Headquarters to command operations. After the establishment of the Headquarters of the Chinese Army, it was changed to the Third Mobile Army. Before Japan surrendered, he was entrusted by the central government with the important task of counter-offensive. Every battle was completed as scheduled. The recent restoration of important towns such as Liuzhou, Guilin, and Wuzhou are all great achievements of General Tang.

General Tang is very strict in managing his army. He is especially kind to the people, especially the youth. He is brave and resourceful. In military affairs, he can always turn danger into safety and defeat into victory in crisis situations. His favorite thing in peacetime is books. He lives frugally and has no hobbies other than smoking. The general loves his comrades like family, so his subordinates sincerely love and respect him. Those who do not know the general may think that General Tang is a brave general, but they do not know that he is actually a learned and thoughtful Confucian general in peacetime.

### The Largest-Scale Airlift Began to Materialize Yesterday; 80,000 of Our Troops Will Be Transported to Beijing and Shanghai Separately

Central News Agency, Chongqing, 6th – According to the US Military Headquarters in the China Theater, the US Air Force will begin transporting Chinese troops to East China in large numbers today. This airlift of 80,000 Chinese troops and their equipment is the largest and most complex airlift in the India-Burma region or the China Theater, and it is also the largest-scale airlift of troops in history. The airlift is divided into two major parts: One part is the transport planes led by General Hickenberger, commander of the US Tenth Air Force, which will transport China's New Sixth Army from Zhijiang to Nanjing. The other part is the "C54" aircraft led by Commander Tranah of the US Air Transport Command India-China Division, which will transport China's Ninety-Fourth Army from Liuzhou to Shanghai. The implementation of the airlift is truly one of the most difficult in military history. At the time of Japan's surrender, most of China's combat troops were distributed in the Zhijiang and Liuzhou areas, preparing to counterattack South China and reopen the port of Guangzhou. Now that the Japanese army has surrendered, it is imperative that the Chinese army recover the Beijing-Shanghai area as soon as possible. Therefore, the US Army Air Corps has undertaken this task. However, the US Army Air Corps has other tasks in other parts of the China Theater. In the past and now, most of them have been used for airlift supplies. In addition, many urgent airlift needs must be met immediately. First, for relief purposes, food, medicine, and medical personnel are airlifted to various Allied prisoner camps in Indochina, Vietnam, and even Manchuria. Secondly, 3,500 people must be airlifted from India to reopen the port of Shanghai, and the Headquarters of the Chinese Army must be transported to Nanjing. In addition, since Chinese motorcades are traveling overland to the recovered areas, they must also rely on airlifts for supplies when passing through food-deficient areas. Therefore, experts in the headquarters of Generals Tratamayer and others have been working day and night to plan so that every available transport plane can be used to the maximum extent. For example, in order to complete the transportation from Zhijiang to Nanjing, the "443rd" Army Air Transport Group, plus the "331st" Zhijiang, the "443rd" Air Transport Group, which came from the continued employment area in India, and under the command of the 19th Air Force, has created an excellent record in supplying the Chinese and British air forces in the India-Burma region. The India-China Air Transport Command has also dispatched a large number of "C54" aircraft to complete the transportation from Liuzhou to Shanghai. One of the most difficult problems is the replenishment of gasoline, because all the gasoline is transported from India. Part of the gasoline of the First Air Force is transported from Kunming, and the rest must be transported from India. Gas stations have been set up along the airports from Zhijiang to Nanjing. The C54 aircraft of the India-China Air Transport Command, which will be responsible for the transportation line from Liuzhou to Shanghai, will use the eastern part of Bengal as its base. It will first fly from Bengal to Liuzhou fully loaded with gasoline, unload the excess gasoline, transport troops to Shanghai, and when flying back to Liuzhou, it will refuel and fly to India for backup. It will then fully load gasoline for the second airlift. It is estimated that the transportation of these two parts of the Chinese army will be completed in 40 days. The round-trip flight distance from Zhijiang to Nanjing is 1,800 miles. The initial transportation of large-scale airlifts, such as transporting Chinese military police, engineering troops, transportation troops, and other necessary personnel, has been completed. The official transportation of the Sixth Army to Nanjing has begun today. After the completion of this military transport, other large-scale plans for airlifting Chinese personnel to other recovered areas will begin.

### Anecdotes from the Arrival of the National Army in Shanghai

— Gu Jiaxi

Yesterday, the first plane carrying the National Army arrived in Shanghai. The number of the plane was "5502". The body of the aircraft was huge and truly astonishing. We approached the body and passed under the thick wing. The propeller was still three or four feet above our heads. The plane could carry more than eighty people.

The uniforms of the National Army were simple. In addition to their names, their chest badges were marked with the characters "Changchun," which was the designation of the army. Their luggage was sparse, with only blankets and water bottles. They were energetic and spirited.

After the National Army disembarked, the Allied American pilots helped unload the latest modern military equipment and ammunition from the front of the plane and handed it to the soldiers. Their brotherly feelings symbolized the solid unity of the United Nations.

Minister Xu Yongchang, who attended the Japanese surrender signing ceremony, happened to be leaving the airport and walking from his car to the plane. He was completely surrounded by photographers in the short distance. Mr. Xu stood still and looked left and right at the cameras of each reporter before slowly walking up the steps and entering the plane. The cameras did not let him go.

Plane "5500" had three naked children painted on it. Plane "5516" had a pink, semi-nude female image hanging on the nose, wearing a pair of red high-heeled leather shoes and resting her head on a red heart, giving a feeling of lightheartedness.

### Respecting the Highest Leader, Generously Donating "Patriotic Contributions"

Mr. Li Wenbin wrote: "The realization of peace is like seeing the sun after the clouds have parted. The joy is indescribable. But thinking silently about the success of the War of Resistance, it relied entirely on the unwavering leadership of our Chairman Chiang and the bloody and courageous sacrifices of the soldiers at the front. As the country celebrates, we feel infinite respect and gratitude for them. We should save part of the celebration expenses and donate them as patriotic contributions for the welfare of the families of fallen soldiers and disabled soldiers. Enclosed are 2 million yuan in Central Reserve Bank notes, which I hope you will collect and transfer accordingly."

Celebrating Together

The home and the country celebrate together, and I should have a grand birthday banquet to extend my celebrations. However, considering that my residence is small and my spirit is poor, I cannot fully enjoy it. Therefore, I will transfer 1 million yuan of banquet funds to your esteemed organization for the aid of orphans and the elderly in the nursing home, so that it can be used for expenses and fulfill the purpose of caring for the elderly and the young, and also for the benefit of my relatives and friends."
