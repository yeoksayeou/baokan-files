### The Thirteenth Anniversary of the Founding of Manchukuo: Sino-Japanese-Manchu Congratulatory Broadcast; The Three Nations Establish a Posture of Comprehensive Combat Power

Nanjing, 2nd (Central News Agency) - Acting Chairman Chen of the National Government, on the evening of the 1st, the thirteenth anniversary of the founding of Manchukuo, delivered a Sino-Japanese-Manchu congratulatory broadcast speech from the Nanjing Radio Station as follows:

Broadcast Speech of Acting Chairman Chen

Since its founding, the Empire of Manchukuo has worked in concert with the Empire of Japan and other nations to engage in the great undertaking of defending East Asia. After thirteen years of united effort, domestic construction has been completed. Since the joint declaration of the three nations of China, Japan, and Manchukuo on November 30th of the 29th year of the Republic (1940), the officials and people of the three countries have, based on the spirit of morality, exerted their full efforts to realize the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. The Empire of Manchukuo and our nation have exchanged diplomatic envoys and striven to enhance national relations. Then, on December 8th of the 30th year of the Republic (1941), the Greater East Asia War erupted, and we have devoted our full efforts to cooperate in the war. I am truly overcome with shared feelings. On February 7th of the 31st year of the Republic (1942), Chairman Wang personally visited Manchukuo and its people in Xinjing to implement the spirit of the Three-Nation Joint Declaration, thereby further strengthening the intimate relationship between the two countries. Now, at this critical juncture for the rise and fall of Greater East Asia, the Government of the Republic of China, based on the late Chairman Wang's posthumous instruction that "Manchukuo, in the past, present, and future, is none other than our compatriots," is working closely with the Government of Manchukuo, with unwavering determination, to cooperate with our allied nation, Japan, and to bravely move forward. When the Greater East Asia War achieves final victory, the national relations between China and Manchukuo will become even closer, and we will strive for economic cooperation to achieve the realization of coexistence and co-prosperity.

### Broadcast Speech of Prime Minister Zhang

Xinjing, 1st (Central News Agency) - Manchu Prime Minister Zhang Jinghui, in the Sino-Japanese-Manchu congratulatory broadcast program at 7:40 PM on the 1st, delivered the following broadcast speech:

At this time of unprecedented urgency in the East Asian situation, I once again look back upon the origins of our nation's founding and express my steadfast determination. The founding ideals of Manchukuo must be achieved after the victory in this war; they are incompatible with the ambition of Anglo-American domination. In the thirteen years since our nation's founding, the nation's development and the harmony of its ethnicities have all proven that the foundation of our nation is based on a noble spirit of morality. During this great war, the nation's overall strength has increased even more, and the nation's determination to defeat Anglo-American ambition and achieve our founding ideals has become even more consolidated. The entire nation is now moving forward courageously to enhance our combat power. Taking the increase in agricultural production as an example, as of early February, procurement has already surpassed the national target quantity. Furthermore, in the current stage of the war, the three nations of China, Japan, and Manchukuo must establish a unified posture of comprehensive combat power. Our Manchukuo is, from beginning to end, one with Japan, and we pledge to fulfill our important mission with all the nation's strength. If the three nations of China, Japan, and Manchukuo, the core of Greater East Asia, are confident in final victory and implement a decisive battle system, then no matter how much Anglo-America relies on its material resources, no matter how fierce the war becomes, and no matter how long the war lasts, final victory will undoubtedly be ours.

### Japanese Forces on Iwo Jima Engage in Hand-to-Hand Combat; Tank Units Also Achieve Great Results

Tokyo, 2nd (Central News Agency) - Japanese forces on Iwo Jima are currently engaged in fierce hand-to-hand combat everywhere. At around 3:00 AM on the 26th, only four soldiers infiltrated enemy positions near the geothermal area, killing or wounding over fifty enemy soldiers and destroying one enemy gun. Furthermore, an assault team of over twenty men under the command of a second lieutenant has, since the 19th, penetrated deep into enemy positions in the Tawarazaka area, killing over forty enemy soldiers at key enemy fire points on the 21st. In addition, three Japanese soldiers, since the 19th, have entered enemy positions in the Byobu Rock area, killing or wounding over twenty enemy soldiers on the southern slopes of Byobu Rock on the 22nd.

Tokyo, 2nd (Central News Agency) - The results achieved by the Japanese tank units on Iwo Jima from February 22nd to 28th are as follows: ten enemy tanks immobilized and unable to move, eight tanks burned, three tanks destroyed, over four hundred and fifty enemy personnel killed or wounded, and three machine guns destroyed.

### Enemy Troops Invading Nidan-Iwa Repulsed Vigorously by Japanese Forces

Tokyo, 2nd (Central News Agency) - American forces on Iwo Jima launched another offensive from the 28th, using tanks as their vanguard in the Osaka-yama area and the Tamana-yama area, attempting to invade Japanese positions. The Japanese garrison defended its strongholds, fought bravely, and crushed the enemy's attempts. In the Osaka-yama area, at around 8:00 AM on the 28th, enemy forces, with about three hundred soldiers and several tanks, attacked Megane-iwa, engaging in fierce fighting throughout the day. At night, Japanese forces launched a suicide attack, completely repulsing the enemy forces. Also, at noon on the 1st, enemy forces with several tanks approached the Japanese positions on Osaka-yama, and after fierce fighting, they had already retreated. In the Tamana-yama area, enemy forces heavily pressed Nidan-iwa at noon on the 28th, and at the same time, a portion also attempted to invade Tamana-yama with tanks, but this was crushed by Japanese forces. The same night, a large enemy unit and twenty tanks repeatedly attacked Nidan-iwa from the Motoyama airfield area, but after being intercepted by Japanese forces, they were repulsed. In this battle, the enemy suffered over three hundred casualties and over ten tanks were immobilized and burned. On March 1st, about two hundred enemy soldiers invaded the eastern area of Nidan-iwa, and Japanese forces concentrated fire on the enemy, repelling them to the southern slopes of Byobu Rock.

This was due to a mistaken identification by the submarine. The crew has mostly been rescued, but six people are still missing.

Editorial

### Prospects for the Pacific War

Due to the enemy's American invasion of Manila and Iwo Jima, the recent Pacific war situation appears particularly tense. Some who do not fully understand military common sense and the overall situation inevitably jump to rash conclusions about the outcome of the war. However, the reality is not as simple as imagined.

If we observe the enemy's American achievements thus far, even though they have occupied Manila, Japanese forces on Luzon Island still possess considerable strength. The purpose of war is to eliminate the opponent's combat power, not to gain or lose a single city or place. Therefore, the main battle on Luzon is still in its early stages. If we observe the enemy's American objectives in invading Luzon and Iwo Jima, one is to hinder Japan from obtaining resources from the South Seas, and the other is to use the island-hopping strategy to advance towards the next targets of operation—the Chinese mainland and the Japanese mainland. Regarding the former, the goal of cutting off Japan's access to resources cannot be effectively achieved until the enemy Americans occupy all the islands of the South Seas. Regarding the latter, due to the recent success of the Japanese forces' offensive on the mainland and the continued resilience of Taiwan, even if the battles of Luzon and Iwo Jima come to an end, the battles to come do not allow the enemy Americans to be optimistic.

Why do we say this? The further the enemy Americans advance, the wider the scope of operations, and the more difficult and complex the war becomes. Recently, U.S. Major General Howard William said in the American newspaper "Daily Telegraph": "So far, the island-hopping strategy of the U.S. military, which concentrates its forces to attack Japan's weaknesses, has been smooth. However, this strategy becomes less effective the closer it gets to the Japanese mainland. The inner-line operator, when the radius of its circumference shortens, will see a rapid increase in its counter-attack power. Japan will use this to keep the U.S. military busy responding in various places in the future, preventing them from concentrating their forces."

Secondly, the U.S. military's transport capacity will also encounter difficulties in the future. The result of the offensive is to expand the scope of the war, which means increasing the length of the transport routes. In the past, if the enemy Americans wanted to maintain an equal strength in the Pacific as in the European theater, the ships needed in the Pacific were already three times those in Europe. No matter how high the U.S. ship production capacity is estimated, it can never catch up with the needs of military consumption. In today's situation where both the East and West theaters must be taken into account, the enemy Americans will either lose one or lose both. The enemy Americans currently have only 30 million tons of usable shipping, and over half has already been used in the Pacific. As a result, the war on the European Western Front has become stalemated. According to American newspapers, this has already caused serious protests from the British government and the Tegore regime, forcing the enemy Americans to conclude an agreement with Britain during the visit of British Undersecretary of State Richard Law to Washington, promising to provide the ships needed to maintain the European offensive. From this, we can see that the U.S. military's plan to maintain its offensive in the Pacific is, in fact, impossible.

Furthermore, the steps of the anti-Axis powers in the Pacific theater are not consistent, and even full of flaws. Enemy Britain, in the Pacific, has tried its best to cater to the needs of enemy America. More than half of its Pacific Fleet consists of aircraft carriers, used to make up for the excessive consumption of the U.S. Navy. However, this is very difficult in reality, as the commander of the enemy British Pacific Fleet, Fraille, said on January 14th of this year: "The American military in European waters follows the British methods, and we also want to match the American methods in the Pacific. However, joint operations between the British and American navies have various difficulties." In order to shirk responsibility for the inconsistent pace, the British naval representative in the U.S., Somerville, also declared on January 20th: "The British Pacific Fleet is subordinate to the U.S. Chief of Naval Operations King, not to Nimitz. Therefore, we have no direct relationship with Nimitz's attacks on Japan." On the other hand, the contradictions between Chongqing and the U.S. in the China theater have long been reflected in the earlier Stilwell incident, which need not be elaborated.

Not only are the contradictions between the anti-Axis powers deep, but even within enemy America, opinions on attacking Japan are not consistent. The Nimitz method, which advocates landing in China, and the Macworth method, which avoids direct confrontation with Japan on the mainland and wants to make full use of the superior anti-Axis naval power, are still being debated in the enemy's American newspapers. We can observe from the enemy Americans' caution in their offensive methods that the enemy Americans are not confident in future operations. We can also infer the future of the Pacific War from this inconsistent pace of the anti-Axis powers and the debates within enemy America.

In short, the situation in the Pacific War is indeed very serious. However, from the perspective of the overall situation, it is beginning to shift in our favor day by day. While we are experiencing difficulties, the enemy's difficulties are even greater. How to endure these temporary difficulties, fully contribute our combat power, and firmly believe in victory is the common responsibility of the East Asian nations, and it is also a necessary condition for achieving victory.

### Paper Warfare by England, America, and the Soviet Union: Full Text of the Crimean Conference Communiqué

Since February 4th, the leaders of England, America, and the Soviet Union have been continuously holding talks in Yalta, Crimea. The conference concluded on February 12th. Subsequently, Churchill, Roosevelt, and Stalin jointly issued a communiqué. According to Reuters, the full text is as follows:

(1) Eliminating Germany

To thoroughly defeat our common enemy, we have reviewed and determined the military plans of the three countries. The general staffs of the three countries held separate group meetings daily throughout the conference. These group meetings, from any perspective, were very satisfactory, resulting in unprecedented close military cooperation among the three countries. Information was fully exchanged mutually.

Opinions have been completely unified. Our Allied land and air forces have specifically stipulated the timing, scale, and direction of future, more forceful strikes against the heart of Germany from the east, west, south, and north.

Our common military plan will only be made public when it is put into practice. However, we believe that the close military cooperation achieved during this conference among the general staffs of the three countries will definitely promote an early end to the war. Separate meetings of the general staffs of the three countries will continue as necessary.

The fate of Nazi Germany has already been decided. If the German people continue to resist hopelessly, they will only pay a heavy price for their defeat.

(2) Partitioning and Governing

After the armed resistance of Germany is completely crushed, we will order the unconditional surrender of Nazi Germany. We have agreed on common policies and plans to enforce the unconditional surrender. These provisions will not be published until Germany is completely defeated. According to the agreed plan, the armed forces of the three countries will occupy special regions of Germany. Parallel administration and management have been clearly stipulated in the plan, to be carried out by a central management committee composed of the commanders-in-chief of the three countries in Berlin.

If France is willing to occupy a region and participate in the four-power management committee, the three countries have decided to invite France to participate. The area of the French occupation zone will be discussed through the Four-Power European Advisory Commission.

Our ultimate goal is to eliminate German militarism and Nazi ideology, and to ensure that Germany will never be able to disrupt world peace again. We have decided to disarm and demilitarize Germany, and to permanently abolish the German General Staff, because the German General Staff has repeatedly contributed to the emergence of German militarism. We have decided to confiscate or destroy all German military facilities, and to eliminate or manage all German industries that could be used for military production. We have decided to punish war criminals in a just and swift manner, and to collect reparations in kind for the destruction caused by the Germans. We have decided to thoroughly destroy the Nazi party, Nazi laws, Nazi organizations, and institutions. We have decided to eradicate all Nazi and militaristic influences from the social organizations, cultural, and economic life of the German people. We have decided to take all other similar measures against Germany as necessary to ensure future peace and security for the entire world. Our aim is not to destroy the German people. Only when Nazi ideology and militarism are completely eradicated will the German people have the hope of achieving a dignified existence and a place in the community of all nations.

(3) Compensation for Losses

We have discussed the issue of the losses inflicted by Germany on the United Nations during this war, and we believe that the only reasonable solution is to force Germany to compensate for these losses to the greatest extent possible.

A commission for compensation of losses will be established and entrusted with examining the scope and capacity of Germany to compensate for the losses of the United Nations. This commission will be located in Moscow.

(4) United Nations General Assembly

We have decided to convene, in the near future, together with our allies, a worldwide international organization to maintain peace and security. We believe that this organization is extremely important because, through the close and constant cooperation of peace-loving people around the world, it may prevent aggression and eradicate the political, economic, and social causes of war.

The Dumbarton Oaks Conference laid the foundation. However, the most important issues, such as voting procedures, were not decided at that time. This conference was able to resolve this difficulty. We have agreed to convene a United Nations conference on April 25, 1945, in San Francisco, USA, to draft the charter of the organization according to the principles adopted during the informal discussions at Dumbarton Oaks.

Discussions will be conducted immediately with the Chinese government and the French provisional government, and, together with the United States, the United Kingdom, and the Soviet Union, other countries will be jointly invited.

The recommendations for voting procedures will be announced immediately after the conclusion of these discussions.

(5) Declaration on Liberated Europe

We have drafted and signed a declaration on the liberation of Europe. This declaration stipulates the political agreement of the three countries and their joint action in resolving the political and economic problems of liberated Europe according to democratic principles. The original text of the declaration is as follows:

"The Chairman of the Council of People's Commissars of the Soviet Union, the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, and the President of the United States, standing on the common interests of their people and the people of liberated Europe, have mutually discussed. They jointly declare that they have mutually concluded an agreement that during the period when the liberation of Europe is not yet consolidated, the three countries will carry out consistent policies, assist the liberated people previously ruled by Nazi Germany, and assist the people of the former Axis European satellite countries, to resolve their pressing political and economic problems by democratic methods.

An European order must be established and social and economic life must be transformed. The method to achieve this goal is to allow the liberated people to eliminate the last traces of Nazi ideology and fascism, and to establish democratic institutions by electing their own people. According to the Atlantic Charter principle that all nations have the right to choose the future form of government for their survival, the nations previously occupied by the aggression of invading countries must be guaranteed to restore sovereignty and independence.

In order to improve the conditions for liberated people to realize this right, the three countries will, as circumstances require, jointly assist the people of any liberated European country, or jointly assist the former European Axis satellite countries, to (A) establish an environment of domestic peace; (B) implement emergency measures to assist impoverished people; (C) establish temporary governments that universally represent democratic elements among all people, and establish governments of public opinion responsible for elections by methods as early as possible; (D) assist in conducting such elections when necessary.

When the three countries discuss issues directly related to other United Nations or temporary governments, or other European countries, they will consult with them.

According to the opinions of the three countries, if the circumstances of any liberated European country, or any former European Axis satellite country, require such action, the three countries will immediately discuss each other and implement the necessary measures of common responsibility stipulated in this conference.

With this declaration, we reiterate our faith in the Atlantic Charter, our faithfulness to the United Nations Declaration, and our determination to establish an equal international order of cooperation among peace-loving countries around the world, to maintain peace, security, freedom, and universal human happiness.

The three countries issued this declaration and hope that the French provisional government can implement this proposed procedure."

(6) Regarding Poland

We attended the Crimean Conference to resolve our differences of opinion on the Polish question. We have discussed the entire situation of the Polish question in many ways. We have also demonstrated our common desire for a restored, strong, free, independent, and democratic Poland. Therefore, as a result of our consultations, our opinions have become consistent. We believe that a nationally unified Polish provisional new government must be reorganized in order to obtain the recognition of the three major powers.

The agreement is as follows:

"Because the Red Army has completely liberated Poland, Poland has produced a new situation. Therefore, a Polish provisional government needs to be established in a wider territory than before the recent liberation of western Poland. The current Polish provisional government must be reorganized on a broader democratic basis, including domestic Polish democrats and Polish people from abroad. This government may then be called the National Unified Polish Provisional Government.

Molotov, Harriman, and Kerr are authorized to form a committee to first conduct discussions in Moscow with people from the current provisional government, as well as with other Polish democratic leaders from within and outside Poland, but the reorganization of the current government must be in accordance with the above principles. This National Unified Polish Provisional Government must take the responsibility of carrying out free, non-interfering national elections as early as possible, and in accordance with the secret ballot method of universal suffrage. During this election, anti-Nazi parties and democratic parties should have the right to nominate candidates.

After the aforementioned National Unified Polish Provisional Government is reorganized, the Soviet Union, which currently has diplomatic relations with the Polish Provisional Government, and the United Kingdom and the United States, will establish diplomatic relations with the new National Unified Polish Provisional Government and exchange ambassadors. The ambassador of the new government should report the situation in Poland to the respective countries.

The leaders of the three countries believe that the eastern border of Poland must be based on the Curzon Line, but in some areas, five to eight kilometers should be ceded to Poland. The leaders of the three countries recognize that Poland must obtain natural expansion of territory in the north and west. They believe that the issue of the scope of this expansion will be discussed with the new National Unified Polish Government at that time, and then the western border of Poland will be finally determined at the peace conference."

(7) Regarding Yugoslavia

We believe that Marshal Tito and Dr. Subasic must be advised to immediately implement the agreement they concluded between them, and to organize a temporary joint government in accordance with that agreement.

It has also been decided to advise that the new Yugoslav government to be established in the future should declare:

(1) The Anti-Fascist Council of National Liberation of Yugoslavia should be expanded to allow members of the Yugoslav Parliament at the outbreak of the war to participate, because they have not sullied their reputation by cooperating with the enemy. Therefore, an institution called the Provisional Parliament should be established;

(2) The legal provisions passed by the Anti-Fascist Council of National Liberation should be approved by the future constitutional drafting conference.

In addition, other Balkan issues were also generally reviewed.

(8) Foreign Ministers' Meetings

Throughout the conference, in addition to the daily meetings of government leaders and foreign ministers, there were also independent meetings of the three foreign ministers with the participation of advisors.

This independent meeting has made a great contribution, and at the conference, it was unanimously agreed to establish a fixed mechanism for formal consultations among the foreign ministers of the three countries. Therefore, foreign ministers will often meet when necessary, or hold meetings every three or four days. These meetings will be held in rotation in the capitals of the three countries, but the first meeting must be convened in London after the United Nations establishes an international security organization.

(9) Hope for Post-War Unity

Our talks in Crimea have once again demonstrated our common determination to preserve and strengthen, during the future peace period, the unity of purpose and unity of action that created the possibility and certainty of victory for the United Nations during this war. We believe that unity is our three countries' sacred mission to our own people, and also to the people of the world.

The above-mentioned human tendency, namely, the consolidation and long-term peace, as stated in the Atlantic Charter: "guaranteeing that people of all countries in the world can live and work in peace and happiness, without fear and poverty," can only be realized under the conditions of continued and developing cooperation, and under the understanding between our three governments and among peace-loving people around the world.

The victory of this war and the establishment of a future international organization will provide us with an unprecedented and excellent opportunity to establish the necessary conditions for lasting peace in the future.

(10) Issue of Releasing Prisoners of War

At the Crimean Conference, a comprehensive agreement was reached regarding the prisoners of war and citizens of England, America, and the Soviet Union within Germany, that is, when they are liberated by the Allied forces who penetrate deep into Germany, detailed regulations will be made on their protection, supply, and repatriation. According to the decision on the right, each Allied country should provide food, clothing, medicine, and other necessities to the citizens of any other Allied country before they are given transportation to return to their home countries. When the Soviet government helps the British and American people return home, British and American officers should provide multi-faceted cooperation. When British and American troops liberate Soviet people, Soviet officers should provide multi-faceted cooperation in helping the Soviet people while they are waiting for transport back to their country in continental Europe or in the United Kingdom. We will do our best to provide these prisoners of war and citizens with facilities to return home as soon as possible, provided that we do not violate the requirements of strictness.

February 11, 1945, Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Churchill, President of the United States Roosevelt, Chairman of the Council of People's Commissars of the Soviet Union Stalin.——(Translated by Fang from Asahi Shimbun on February 14, with reference to the Baibai Bochi on February 15)

### Local Charity and Educational Organizations to be Evacuated First, Population Evacuation Committee Operates in Four Groups

Since the Shanghai Population Evacuation Committee started working, it has been very busy every day answering inquiries from citizens or written requests. Recently, the committee decided on evacuation steps. It will first find ways to evacuate charity and educational organizations. As for individuals and their families who voluntarily leave Shanghai, they should apply to their respective hometown associations, which will compile and submit requests to the committee to facilitate unified planning and distribution, and to achieve effective group evacuation. The committee organization is divided into four groups: general affairs, survey design, liaison, and execution. The responsible personnel of each group have been determined: Cao Jingang is the director of the general affairs group, Chen Binhe is the director of the survey design group, Xiang Kangyuan is the director of the liaison group, and Gu Jishi is the director of the execution group. The committee address is temporarily located on the third floor of the municipal government.

### First District Inspector Liu Yuping Assumed Office Yesterday

### Interest Rate Hike by Banks and Money Shops Not Yet Unified

Regarding the issue of banks and money shops intending to increase lending interest rates, although the bankers' and money changers' associations once held a joint meeting to discuss it, they have not yet reached an agreement. Some banks are unwilling to increase interest rates too much in accordance with the wishes of the financial authorities, fearing that this will increase the interest burden of legitimate industrial and commercial operations. It is heard that the principles of the money shops have been roughly determined: increasing the outstanding interest by 90 yuan per thousand yuan, and charging a certain amount of handling fee. According to inquiries by a Central News Agency reporter, the previous joint meeting of the bankers' and money changers' associations proposed that banks increase lending interest rates by 18 points, but some banks did not agree to this. However, some banks are unable to maintain their business if they do not increase interest rates because of business relations, low income, and huge expenses. Therefore, this situation is quite complicated. As a result, the money shops decided to charge 90 yuan of outstanding interest and a separate handling fee. It is difficult for the banks to take a unified step on the lending interest rate, and they will make their own decisions based on the business situation of each bank.

### Minister Matsushima Explains the Pacific War Situation: Enemy America Suffered Unprecedented Damage

The Allied Japan Army-Navy Joint Reporting Association held a meeting at the HSBC Hotel at 3:00 PM yesterday. Minister Matsushima, Captain Matsumoto, and Torin Toshio, Wang Bingnan, Liu Zhennan, and many reporters from various newspapers attended. Minister Matsushima delivered a speech, explaining in detail the recent Pacific War situation, the huge losses suffered by the US military in Iwo Jima and Ulithi, and the reactions in the US. The main points of the speech are as follows:

Japanese Army's Clever Tactics on Iwo Jima

The enemy US Marine Corps that has landed on Iwo Jima has three divisions, with more than 45,000 people. More than half of these were damaged. See the war report released by the Japanese General Headquarters for details. The area of Iwo Jima is only 30 square kilometers. The enemy used various combat bodies, aircraft carriers, elite troops, and air force in the operation. Even today, it is still under intense attacks by the Japanese base defense forces in the northeast, and is fighting hard. The Japanese army guarding Mount Suribachi and the southern pier positions used clever tactics, concentrated its forces in the central position, and fought a bloody battle with the enemy.

Unprecedented Damage to Landing Enemy Forces

According to the enemy's broadcast on the 2nd, the general offensive against Japan on February 27th made no progress due to the power of the Japanese army's automatic weapons. It has been more than two weeks since the enemy US began landing operations on Iwo Jima. The damage suffered by the Marine Corps has been the most severe since the 158th year (the time when the US Marine Corps was established). If the damage from the bleeding battles suffered by the enemy continues to repeat, it will inevitably lead to greater obstacles. Recent reactions in the US are proof of this.

Battle for Luzon Island Reaches Decisive Stage

The fighting in Manila, Philippines, is still extremely fierce. The elite soldiers led by Japanese General Iwabuchi are inflicting heavy blows on the enemy in the city. His troops are unmoving and resisting strongly under intense artillery fire. The Japanese army in the area northeast of Manila is launching fierce attacks with heavy artillery and automatic weapons against the main US forces. The overall war situation on Luzon Island is rich and has reached the decisive stage.

Enemy America Attempts to Bomb Okinawa

Since yesterday morning, a part of the enemy's carrier-based aircraft has attacked the Japanese Okinawa Islands. Judging from their intentions, they are nothing more than impatient due to the lack of progress in the operations on Iwo Jima and Luzon Island, so they are trying to operate elsewhere. The enemy's strategy seems to be to create airfields within an appropriate distance around the Japanese mainland, in order to strengthen its bombing power against Japan and expect the progress of the war situation. The enemy used this kind of strategy against Germany in Europe, but in the end, the enemy must encounter great difficulties, that is, the bleeding problem. The enemy America's transportation force is far away, while Japan can wait and strike at close range. The closer the enemy gets, the more bleeding it will be. In American history, the damage caused by this Pacific War is unprecedented. In the end, what the United States gains is only the stimulating reaction of its people. The chaos of its future domestic situation can also be imagined.

### Sluggish Real Estate Transactions, Prices Decline

The Shanghai real estate market experienced very active trading in the second half of last year due to an influx of speculative capital in various industries. By the end of December last year, prices had increased to about nine or ten times the level of the same month in the previous year. However, since the market opened this spring, the business of various companies has become noticeably quiet, and land prices in various districts have clearly declined. It is understood that the main reasons are: (1) There are many unfounded rumors in the market, and both buyers and sellers are mostly adopting a wait-and-see attitude, resulting in few transactions and a downward trend in prices. (2) Real estate transactions are mostly priced in gold, and the price of gold has soared this spring, increasing by more than double compared to last year. Sellers are waiting for an opportunity before they are willing to sell. It is said that if the price of gold does not fall, there is little possibility of a particularly strong real estate market.

### Air Defense Trainee Second Class Graduates

The Air Defense Personnel Training Institute, specially established by the Civil Defense Headquarters of this city, had its second class of over one hundred and ninety people complete their training period. A graduation ceremony is scheduled to be held at 10:00 AM today (the 3rd) at the institute inside the Race Course. At that time, Vice Minister Du Zhengjian will preside, and officials of all levels will participate. It is also reported that memorial prizes have been donated by various sectors and will be distributed to the graduating trainees.

### Municipal Finance Bureau Begins Collection of Spring Business Tax and Announces Tax Standards

The Municipal Finance Bureau announced that the business tax for the old one-eight districts of this city has been submitted to and approved by the municipal government, and will be implemented starting this spring. All commercial firms in this city should truthfully report their business status in accordance with the regulations in order to determine the tax amount for collection. If the reported information is false, penalties will be imposed in accordance with the regulations. The application forms for this declaration will be issued by the bureau from today until the 8th, free of charge. If the business firms have already joined a trade association, the forms will be issued by the association. If they have not joined an association, the business firms should promptly send personnel with the company chop to the Business Tax Collection Section of the bureau on Madang Road to collect the forms for completion and submission. It is reported that the business tax collection standards are divided into: (1) For goods sales businesses, the standard is the total amount of business income; (2) For goods manufacturing businesses, the standard is the amount of business capital. Businesses that (1) fail to establish account books in violation of regulations, (2) refuse to report or refuse investigation, (3) make false declarations or underreport, (4) conceal information to evade taxes, (5) conceal documents or forge accounts, will be punished separately in accordance with the revised Business Tax Collection Regulations.

American Wartime Concepts are Weak

During the last World War, a friend of mine resided in an American home. When they received news of a soldier's death on the front lines, the family wept and wailed in utter chaos, cursing Wilson's policies and government authorities, causing a great disturbance. When war does not directly affect them, the American public is often indifferent to the concept of war. However, when they suffer losses, a strong reaction ensues. The Americans in the Pacific war do not have a consistent and unwavering goal. When we question prisoners, their answers are nothing more than that the purpose of the war is to oppress Japan and gain freedom. They are completely ignorant of the central ideal. Therefore, their concept of war is as different as heaven and earth from the supreme mission of the people of Greater East Asia to sacrifice themselves for their country. The American military's concept of warfare is extremely weak, and their casualties are high. How the Greater East Asia war situation will ultimately unfold is quite obvious, and our concept of certain victory is even stronger.

Thoughts on the Problem of Population Evacuation

Minister Matsushima expressed the following thoughts on the rumors in Shanghai and the problem of population evacuation: (1) Recently, there have been many rumors in this city, causing confusion. In fact, for the sake of the future of both China and Japan, Japan's unwavering determination to protect Shanghai has not changed. All kinds of rumors arising from evacuation and escape are merely a reflection of idle speculation. (2) China and Japan share the same fate and jointly protect Shanghai. Evacuating the elderly and weak is an appropriate measure. The purpose of this action is to address the enemy's blind bombing. If we can prevent the American military from landing in China and from bombing, then there would be no need for population evacuation. Therefore, this trouble is bestowed upon us by the enemy Americans. Recently, the Americans have frequently announced the use of new weapons. This can prove the demoralization of the American military. According to common sense, the invention or use of new weapons is best kept secret. Why would they publicize it so loudly? The Americans are now openly disclosing it, and there must be another purpose behind it.

Zhao Zhi, the former division commander of the Chongqing army, held an important position in the military. He was killed by the Chongqing authorities last October for participating in the peace movement. Zhao's widow traveled to Shanghai. His friendly comrades-in-arms, knowing that Zhao's family was in dire straits and struggling to survive, initiated a charity performance of Peking opera by the Chinese Hongmen General Association to raise funds for the family. It is scheduled to be held for three days on the 7th, 8th, and 9th of this month at the Tianchan Theater on Fourth Malu.

Letter to the Editor: "Dear Sir, In the local news section of your newspaper on the 27th, it was reported that the Security Command had cracked a blackmail case and that 'Lu Xilin, Sun Huande, and Hu Jinzai, three accomplices, were arrested at the Yizhong Money Shop on Tianjin Road.' None of our employees at this shop are named as such. We fear that the outside world may not know the truth. Therefore, we have written this letter to clarify the matter and request a correction.

### Commemorating the "March 3rd" Friends Festival

— Huang Jingwan

On March 3rd, 1923, I and six other friends from various provinces in Shanghai initiated the Friends Festival at the Chenggeng Village Industrial School in western Shanghai. Since then, every year on this day, I have invited close friends to gather and discuss to commemorate it. This year is the eleventh Friends Festival on March 3rd. At this time of greater hardship and increasing difficulties in people's livelihoods, I am unable to hold a banquet. I have written a folk song to entertain you gentlemen. The lyrics are as follows:

Friends Festival Song: I advocate the Friends Festival, selecting the third day of the third month. Humans are the most intelligent of all things, and friendship is one of the five human relationships. The world is in a great war, an unprecedented catastrophe. The sound of mourning is everywhere, and it is heartbreaking to hear. It is difficult to find true friends in this world, and sincerity and love are essential. It is appropriate to make many good friends, and humans should help each other. Good friends can be trusted. Integrity and loyalty are important, and one should not forget lifelong promises. Every year on this day, we will hold a lively meeting. I only hope that my compatriots will always be well and never change.
