### Enemy Landing on Phuket Island, Thailand, Repelled by Japanese Garrison - Battles in the Lok Doung Area of North Borneo

Shonan, 26th - Central News Agency dispatch: On the 25th, at approximately 8:00 AM, two enemy American cruisers approached Phuket Island, Thailand, located 300 kilometers northwest of Penang on the central west coast of the Malay Peninsula. After conducting naval bombardment, approximately 500 enemy troops landed near McCall at the northwest end of the island using five landing craft. The Japanese garrison immediately launched a fierce counterattack, inflicting heavy damage and ultimately repelling the enemy back to sea. The enemy's main force subsequently patrolled the sea southeast of Phuket Island, attacking nearby airfields with naval guns and aerial bombing. However, the enemy's forces were very weak, with only about six transport ships. This landing attempt was undoubtedly merely a probe to test our strength.

Tokyo, 26th - Central News Agency dispatch: Phuket Island is located in Phuket Province, Thailand, 300 kilometers northwest of Penang Island. The entire island is approximately 30 kilometers east-west and 50 kilometers north-south. The island is a rich tin resource area. Thailand produces 50,000 tons of tin annually, of which the island accounts for eight-tenths. Previously, the mining industry was operated with British capital and managed by overseas Chinese. The ore was transported to Penang. The enemy's attack on the island this time is to support the operations in the Balikpapan oilfield area of Borneo, attempting to seize important southern resources for the war against Japan.

Southern Front Base, 26th - Central News Agency dispatch: The enemy in the Miri area of North Borneo still has its main force deployed in the Lok Doung area (20 kilometers north of Miri). They occasionally dispatch small numbers of troops to invade the Japanese defense line in order to expand their territory. On the 23rd, the enemy used several landing craft to navigate a tributary of the Baram River, attempting to land at Alan. The Japanese army in the area ambushed the enemy, repelling them in just 20 minutes. Furthermore, the enemy is eager to use the Miri airfield and appears to have begun using it recently.

### Japanese Special Attack Units Active, Launching Surprise Attacks at Any Moment - Control of Absolutely Victorious Air Battle Secured

Tokyo, 26th - Central News Agency dispatch: Recently, when the enemy attempted to land near the Japanese mainland, the Japanese side repeatedly launched special attack units to meet them head-on and inflict heavy blows. The closer the distance, the more advantageous the activities of the Japanese special attack units become, and the activities of other aviation units are also becoming exceptionally favorable. Okinawa is 700-800 nautical miles away from the Japanese mainland. However, the enemy preparing to land this time is unlikely to launch a landing operation from such a distance. The enemy fleet that previously attacked the mainland with naval guns could only approach the sea area about 30-40 miles from the mainland due to the range of their guns. The operational range of the aircraft from their aircraft carriers is probably between 200 and 500 miles. Although the troop transport ships are further away, the landing craft are fast-moving, so their position distance should also not be far. At the same time, the enemy has widely deployed radio wave detection networks, and the fighter planes have also strengthened their air defense artillery facilities. Therefore, no matter how far away, there is no such thing as a long distance. This war is also a war between land bases and aircraft carrier bases, and the Japanese army is in an absolutely advantageous position and can control an absolutely certain and victorious air battle. At the same time, special attack units will definitely be able to fully exert their active functions. As the distance gets closer, the effectiveness of the enemy's radio wave detectors, which they rely on as a sharp weapon, will be reduced. Even if the enemy's radio waves accurately detect the Japanese aircraft taking off and measure their position, there will be more than 30 minutes to an hour of leeway time, which is another matter. However, at extremely close range, when the enemy aircraft tries to take off, the special attack aircraft will already be in an offensive posture in the enemy's airspace. This happens with incredible speed. Therefore, no matter how quickly the enemy detects the movement of Japanese aircraft, their fighter planes cannot take off immediately. Therefore, in order to defend against the attack of Japanese special attack units, the enemy must station a considerable number of fighter planes in the sky for 24 hours a day to perform patrol duties. The Japanese army not only dispatches special attack units, but also supplements them with fighter planes, making it impossible for the enemy to have even half a second of respite. Even if the attacking enemy has the same number of aircraft as the air force, it is not so simple in reality. If their air force base is on land, that is another matter. However, the enemy aircraft take off and land on the decks of aircraft carriers at sea, and when taking off and landing, the aircraft carrier cannot proceed at full speed. It goes without saying that there will be problems with the aircraft's fuel, and the fuel consumption of the aircraft carrier will also be very different from usual. In addition, drastic weather changes and night often cause unexpected accidents. On the contrary, the Japanese army can launch surprise attacks even at night, and is especially confident in maritime and aerial navigation skills. They can launch surprise attacks at any time, and the bombs carried by the aircraft are larger and more numerous than those used in the Okinawa battle. In addition, when aircraft carriers transport landing craft to the fleet, they are completely exposed to Japanese special attack units, so they must be equipped with considerable aircraft carrier formations for cover. In addition, there must be fuel supply and maintenance facilities. Because the enemy's landing points and targets are fixed and cannot be moved at will, no matter what kind of mobile unit it is, it cannot escape the attacks of Japanese special attack aircraft. This is the enemy's fatal weakness.

### The Emperor Personally Handles State Affairs

Report by President Shimomura

Tokyo, 26th - Central News Agency dispatch: The first All-Japan Political Association Branch Manager's Conference was held at the House of Representatives on the 25th. State Minister Shimomura, President of the Information Bureau, respectfully described the Emperor's diligent handling of state affairs and his daily life, saying that His Majesty's sacred body is becoming increasingly healthy and that he personally handles all state affairs. As subjects, we are sincerely fearful and humbly increase our determination to serve the country.

### American Land and Sea Transportation Increasingly Difficult

Tokyo, 26th - Central News Agency dispatch: Eager for an early decisive battle with Japan, the United States is striving to expand its land and sea transportation capacity to strengthen its forces and military supplies as the Pacific war situation shifts. This trend has been particularly noticeable since last month. Pacific Fleet Commander Nimitz made a bold statement when the mobile units launched an attack, saying, "The Pacific war situation is on the verge of the landing stage." Judging from these various circumstances, the great decisive battle between Japan and the United States, each deploying its full strength, will be in the near future. The current state of American land and sea transportation capacity is as follows: The withdrawal of troops and materials from Europe: It is said that at the end of the European war, the total strength of the American army on the European front was approximately 3.7 million. Among them, 500,000 will remain in Europe. Except for about 1.1-1.2 million returning to their home country for demobilization, the rest will be transferred to various places on the Pacific war front. Transporting such a large number of troops from Europe requires traversing long sea lanes to reach the Pacific war front. If we consider the transportation of military supplies and the supply of new military goods from the home country, the American maritime transport future is extremely difficult. Recalling the precedent of the last European war, it took the American side more than a year to withdraw troops from Europe, we can imagine. According to the European Invasion Force Transportation Command, since the end of the war against Germany until the end of June, the total number of American troops withdrawn reached 310,000. Even now, the number of troops withdrawn is only 573,000, which falls short of the initial target of the American Transportation Command to withdraw 740,000 in two months, which shows the difficulty of its transportation capacity. The state of railway transport in the home country: The American Army Department stated that transporting the materials for each division requires dozens of freight trains or more. As in the past, the number of trains transporting troops to the UK reached as many as 1,500 per day. The number of troops and materials currently being transported to the Pacific war zone is far greater than what was transported to the UK in the past. Moreover, there were more than two years of preparation time for the European landing operation. On the contrary, this emergency transport is scheduled to be completed in just three months. Therefore, more than 7,500 military transport vehicles have been converted for the sole purpose of transporting troops. The American government has been working hard to increase vehicle production since last year in order to cope with emergency situations and strive to enhance land transport capacity. It remains questionable whether the problem of insufficient military vehicles can be alleviated in the future. The difficulty of war transportation, in addition to the lack of trains, is the lack of railway employees. This situation is particularly severe in the western states. US President Truman said that if 65,000 new employees are not added quickly, the supply to the Pacific front will encounter considerable obstacles.

Editorial

### Enemy America's Impatience and Japan's Steadfastness

In the past few days, this city has been subjected to indiscriminate bombing by enemy aircraft. This is a strategy of nerve warfare and also a manifestation of enemy America's impatience with the war.

Enemy America hopes to end the war against Japan as soon as possible. First, because the longer the war drags on, the more sacrifices the military will make and the more materials will be consumed. Although Enemy America prides itself on its abundant material resources, it does not want to lose a large number of human resources. Therefore, it eagerly hopes that the war can end soon. Second, since the end of the European war, Enemy American public opinion has clearly shown signs of relaxation. Therefore, the generals in charge of the Pacific operations cannot help but become anxious. Third, the Soviet Union is now recuperating, and the work of rehabilitation and production is gradually beginning. Enemy America does not have time for this. If the war against Japan is prolonged, it will inevitably affect the balance of international power in the future.

Therefore, Enemy America is spreading various rumors, probing for strategies, and doing its best to drag the Soviet Union into the whirlpool of the war against Japan. The activities of the San Francisco Conference and Song Ziwen's visit to Moscow are all driven by this motive. The most egregious of these strategies is to try to overwhelm Japan's vigorous fighting spirit with continuous indiscriminate bombing.

After sacrificing a large number of troops and ships to invade Okinawa Island, Enemy America is loudly proclaiming the slogans of landing on the Chinese coast and attacking the Japanese mainland. However, the experience of the fierce battle in Okinawa makes them afraid to try lightly. Moreover, in fact, due to the difficulty of deployment, there is a time limit. Therefore, indiscriminate bombing has become Enemy America's only strategy in this transitional stage. Enemy aircraft are not only bombing major Japanese cities, but also indiscriminately bombing small and medium-sized cities. The purpose of this strategy is less to destroy military facilities and more to destroy the morale of the Japanese people.

However, the people of Japan are all loyal to the emperor and love their country. Enemy aircraft can destroy the wooden houses of the Japanese people, but they can never destroy the traditional spirit of the Japanese nation. Or, to put it another way, because of the indiscriminate bombing by enemy aircraft, the animosity of the Japanese people has been further enhanced, creating the spiritual elements for the decisive battle on the Japanese mainland.

Moreover, air raids are not the main body of combat, but only an auxiliary means of combat. Even continuous indiscriminate bombing cannot concretely realize the purpose of the war. Most of Japan's munitions factories have been moved underground or to high mountains. The destructive power of enemy aircraft can only reach major cities or small and medium-sized cities, but cities are not the source of decisive combat power. Observing the national conditions of Japan under the continuous bombing by enemy aircraft, we feel an unexpected calmness, which is enough to prove the failure of Enemy America's nerve strategy.

Because Enemy America's impatience reveals Japan's steadfastness even more. The decisive battle on the Japanese mainland is a struggle to determine the fate of Japan. Therefore, the Japanese people are very calm and pour all their efforts into their respective positions to serve the country, making the construction of Japan's entire fortress more perfect. The later the period of Enemy America's attack on the Japanese mainland, the stronger the defense of the Japanese mainland will be. The psychology of Enemy America, which is now impatient and hesitant, is a weakness in the decisive battle. The fact that Japan is steadfast in its will and is preparing step by step is the key to victory in the decisive battle.

In Enemy America's impatience and agitation and Japan's indomitable spirit, we can predict that Enemy America will suffer a fatal blow whether in the decisive battle on the Japanese mainland or when landing on the Chinese coast.

### Japanese Military Reporter Analyzes War Situation

Tokyo, 26th - Central News Agency dispatch: A military reporter from the Japanese Allied Press wrote an article analyzing the current war situation, stating that Enemy America's current air raids on Japan can be said to be a prelude to the war on the Japanese mainland. Its purpose is still to destroy Japan's war capability and disrupt the morale of the people, so it is called strategic bombing. It has been a year since Japan was first bombed by the B29 in Kitakyushu last June. Domestic air defense facilities and the people's air raid training have reached a considerable level. However, the general public is quite skeptical about Japan's aircraft production capacity, which is really unnecessary worry. Japan's aircraft production is now several times higher than before. Some people believe that Japan has not implemented an aerial interception war, so they think that Japan lacks interception aircraft. It is necessary to know that the maintenance of air power is limited, so it is necessary to make effective use of the current air power. Therefore, we have to sacrifice some aspects in order to increase our air power and launch a full-scale attack on the enemy at the moment of the decisive battle on the mainland. This is the reason why we should be cautious. In the Italian campaign, Japan failed because it could not supply its forces. Learning from this lesson, we cannot easily consume our air power. Once the decisive battle on the mainland begins, we will launch a major offensive to completely reduce the enemy's war results.

### Enemy America Peering at Chinese Coast, Avoiding Landing on Japanese Mainland - Military Commentator Analyzes Military and Political Situation

A military commentator in Shanghai recently made a detailed analysis of the internal situation of the Anglo-American-Soviet summit and the American military's transfer to the Pacific, as follows:

### Anglo-American-Soviet Summit Intermittent

Regarding the Anglo-American-Soviet summit, although there has been no formal announcement regarding the discussion of military issues, it has been mentioned briefly. British Prime Minister Churchill, who participated in the Potsdam talks, returned home to participate in the domestic general election on the 25th. It was announced on the 24th that Churchill had returned to London and that the talks were still continuing. Foreign Secretary Eden and Labour leader Atlee also returned home. US President Truman and Soviet leader Marshal Stalin continued to hold talks. Even if Churchill is re-elected, he is scheduled to return to Berlin on the 27th and 28th. The British side has also officially announced that the Berlin talks cannot be suspended on the 25th. However, according to another report, Prime Minister Churchill's return home means that the meeting will be adjourned on the 25th. However, Truman and Stalin will continue the talks next week, regardless of which party wins the British election. The British side also said that if Churchill fails in this election, Foreign Secretary Eden will still be re-elected. He will return to Potsdam to continue the talks. However, if Atlee is elected as the new British Prime Minister, he will have to deal with his duties and must stay in the country. In addition, another report stated that some of the American delegation participating in the talks have left Berlin and the rest will continue to leave. The authorities have denied this. Another report stated that President Truman will arrive in Frankfurt on the 26th to hold talks with Eisenhower and inspect the area and the American troops stationed there. Various rumors are inconsistent.

### Enemy Intends to Strengthen Command Structure

In short, the content of the Anglo-American-Soviet summit remains a secret to this day. Only. However, it was only recently announced that Southeast Asia Commander Mountbatten also participated in the talks. According to a London report on the 25th, Mountbatten, Supreme Commander of the Southeast Asia Allied Forces, arrived in England on the 25th. He will participate in the Berlin conference. Another announcement stated that Mountbatten arrived in the UK by air after holding a meeting with Truman, Stalin, and Churchill in the joint staff headquarters of the Allied Forces at the Potsdam Conference. A few days ago, Southeast Asia Army Commander Mountbatten and McCauley held talks in Manipur. Subsequently, the Washington Post reported, emphasizing that the Pacific operations command structure would be reorganized soon to enable the British army to operate in the Southwest Pacific region, especially expanding the scope of operations. The combat troops currently under the command of McCauley's headquarters in Borneo are the British National Allied Forces. This unit will be transferred to the command of Mountbatten's headquarters. Two weeks ago, Mountbatten and McCauley discussed the Southwest Pacific operations. It was agreed that the Southeast Asia Army, the Indian Army, and the Australian Army would be transferred to McCauley's area for operations. Later, on the 15th, Mountbatten went to Calcutta to participate in the tripartite meeting to discuss the reorganization plan. Therefore, in this reorganization of the Southwest Pacific, it is difficult to judge in terms of time where McCauley's Seventh Fleet and air force will move in the future. However, according to the enemy's troop movements and various information, it is speculated that it may launch a landing operation on the Chinese mainland this autumn.

### Enemy America Transfers Troops to the Pacific

According to a recent announcement by the Paris Regional Command, most of the ships currently used by the United States will be transferred to Marseille next month to transport troops directly to the Pacific. However, the number of troops transferred through the United States in August will be reduced by 40% compared to this month. According to a United Press report, the amount of transportation in the southern French ports should be tripled in August. The transportation is consistent with the original plan to move troops to the Pacific. Some ships will also be responsible for transporting troops from the west coast of the United States to the Pacific war zone. The reasons for the relocation are as follows: Lieutenant General Stanley, commander of the US Army forces in the West Pacific, is preventing the American army from becoming discouraged. Colonel Marsh, director of the National Defense Transportation Administration, said that the US land transportation capacity is insufficient, so direct transportation measures have been taken. In fact, the United States is full of peace-loving air, so it is strengthening the movement of troops to the Pacific to avoid going to the front from home and to promote operations. According to the Associated Press, the transportation from Marseille to the Pacific will be completed. The transfer of American troops from Europe to the United States will be strengthened in mid-September, and the 50,000-ton Europa from Germany will also be used to take charge of transportation. From this, it can be seen that the enemy America will move all its troops in mid-August. At the end of September, it will be prepared for combat operations and will try to launch new operations in October. The enemy's troop movements after September will be used for operations in the spring of next year, so there will be a transfer through the United States. A United Press report from Washington on the 21st stated that this autumn will be a time for full preparation. Before the decisive battle, there will be continuous bombing, and several divisions of the US Army and Marines will participate in the landing battle. However, there are now three armies of the US military in the Pacific war zone. Another army is moving from Europe to the Pacific. Therefore, the US military plans to have four armies, that is, 40 divisions, participate. At the same time, the US military is trying to capture the ports of Guangzhou and Hong Kong on the Chinese coast to prepare for operations on the Chinese mainland. This offensive will reach its climax around October.

### Enemy Launches Strategic Offensive

It is still difficult to determine whether the US military will attack Fuzhou on the Chinese coast and go straight to the vicinity of Hangzhou in Zhejiang, or land at any other place. From this, it can be seen that the enemy has not launched a major war. Even if there is a landing war on the Japanese mainland, a landing operation on the mainland will be launched before the war. The trend is gradually rising. The enemy America hopes to gain huge benefits with small sacrifices. This habitual technique is to avoid the landing battle on the Japanese mainland and reduce the damage to the ships and troops by resistance. It also uses the sacrifices of the Chinese people to destroy Japan's war capability. Therefore, it has carried out various political and strategic efforts to test peace. Under this plan, the trend of landing on the Japanese mainland and the Chinese mainland war is extremely obvious. What is most interesting is that the United States is doing its best to launch a political and strategic offensive against Japan. For example, First Fleet Commander King, Third Fleet Commander Halsey, Aviation Chief Arnold, and the recently appointed US Marine Corps Deputy Commander Tate, etc., are all doing their best to promote the idea of a fierce war against Japan to intimidate Japan. In short, comparing the calm and resilient spirit of the Japanese commanders with the indiscriminate and aggressive strategies of the American front-line commanders, one can see the difference.

### Multiple B-29 Type Aircraft Attack Kawasaki Area; Possible Mines Dropped in Osaka Bay

Tokyo, 26th (Central News Agency) - Approximately fifty enemy B-29 type aircraft attacked the Kawasaki area starting around 10:00 PM on the 25th. There was some damage in the surrounding vicinity. The Japanese side claims to have shot down five enemy aircraft. Also, a portion of the enemy aircraft operated over the Nagano, Gunma, and other areas of Japan, attempting to restrain the activities of the Japanese airborne units. It is noted that the American aircraft used almost exclusively bombs when attacking Kawasaki City, suggesting to us their future methods of attacking industrial cities, which deserves our military's attention.

Osaka, 26th (Central News Agency) - At 00:00 AM on the 26th, approximately fifteen enemy B-29 type aircraft invaded from the Kii Channel. Among them, ten advanced northeast along the Wakasa Bay, while the other five operated in Osaka Bay, seemingly dropping mines. Also, starting at 9:15 PM on the 25th, more than ten B-29 type aircraft, divided into four groups, dispersed and invaded the Central Military District, operating in various locations such as Matsue, Hiroshima, and Fukui.

Tokyo, 26th (Central News Agency) - Two hundred and thirty enemy small aircraft operated over the northern coast of Shikoku and the southern islands of Osaka Bay from 5:00 AM to 6:30 AM on the 25th. Around 9:00 AM, ninety enemy small aircraft invaded the Tokai Military District from Shiga Prefecture and, after operating in the northwestern part of Japan, departed. Also, between 11:00 AM and 4:30 PM on the 26th, approximately one hundred enemy carrier-based aircraft invaded the Tokai region of Japan, targeting airfields, transportation facilities, ships, and cities as their primary targets, and then fled south.

### It is Said the Three Allied Nations have Adopted Joint Action on Japanese Issues, a Decision Made During the Summit

Stockholm, 26th (Central News Agency) - Regarding the East Asia policy discussed during the Three-Power Conference, according to a Potsdam dispatch from the Exchange Telegraph Company, it was decided during the meeting on the 22nd that the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union would take joint action against the Japanese government when the conference concluded.

Tokyo, 26th (Central News Agency) - It is reported that during the Potsdam Conference, the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union reached a decision regarding the war against Japan and will issue a joint communique to Japan in the near future. The Japanese diplomatic circles are not paying much attention to this claim because the agenda of the Potsdam Conference is being kept strictly confidential by the three participating countries. The reports from the United States and Britain are based solely on conjecture and official rumors, confusing the public and are not credible. However, this does not mean that the Three-Power Conference did not discuss East Asian issues. The Japanese side believes that there is a high probability that the leaders of the three nations discussed East Asian issues. However, much of the information regarding the war against Japan reported by the United States and Britain contains propaganda, so the Japanese press and public opinion are taking a calm attitude toward it.

### America Plans for European Peace Plan

Lisbon, 26th (Central News Agency) - According to a report from London's "Daily Telegraph," the Three-Power Conference in Potsdam is currently drafting a memorandum on a plan to rebuild peace in Europe. It is said that the plan is being drafted by the Soviet side and implies that five years after the joint administration of Germany, starting in 1950, a formal agreement will be made with the German government.

### Churchill Visits the King

Stockholm, 26th (Central News Agency) - According to reports from London, British Prime Minister Churchill reported to King George at Buckingham Palace last night on the details of the first Potsdam Conference. Churchill stayed inside for quite some time.

### British General Election About to Unfold

Stockholm, 26th (Central News Agency) - According to a report from Reuters' political correspondent, the final act of the British general election is about to unfold in a few hours. The world will know whether Britain will establish a right-wing party government or a left-wing party government. At the same time, it remains to be seen whether Churchill will continue to be the Prime Minister of Britain. Regardless of who wins, Churchill or Attlee, they will both be free to return to Berlin to participate in the Potsdam Conference.

### Mountbatten Returns to England

Stockholm, 26th (Central News Agency) - According to reports from London, Southeast Asia Allied Forces Supreme Commander Lord Mountbatten arrived in England by plane yesterday afternoon.

### French Troops Withdraw From Eastern Syria

Berlin, 26th (Central News Agency) - According to a broadcast from Paris radio: The commander of the British forces in the Middle East, General Paget, in consultation with the French commander in Lebanon, General Beynet, agreed that French troops will withdraw from eastern Syria. However, several French troops will remain stationed in the western coastal areas of Lebanon and Syria. At the same time, several government offices in Lebanon will continue to be administered by France.

### Currency Issues Reach Critical Juncture

Nanjing, 26th (Central News Agency) - High wartime prices are an unavoidable phenomenon. However, judging from the current rampant price increases in various regions, it is already contrary to the current rules of the wartime system. The recent price problem is not simply a matter of material shortages causing panic. It is actually caused by merchants manipulating speculation. The authorities, fearing the high rise of commodity prices and the insufficient number of currency chips, resulted in a panic, so they repeatedly issued large bills, hoping to relieve the degree of panic. Unexpectedly, every time they issued them, the price soared again. The result was that the more they issued, the more intense the price increase, forming a mutually causal phenomenon. From this, it can be seen that issuing currency is not a way to solve the panic phenomenon. Furthermore, in order to absorb capital to stabilize prices, the authorities issued gold bonds in May of this year. To date, there have been four issues. As a result, a considerable amount of capital has been recovered, but it has had no effect on the policy of stabilizing prices. Moreover, the price of gold itself is still soaring wildly, creating an unprecedented record of more than 10,000 yuan per ounce. From this, we can once again prove the failure of the gold bond policy. The current currency problem is presenting an extremely serious situation. Shanghai clearing bills are full of counterfeit money, and buying and selling transactions are all empty words. If this continues, currency inflation will inevitably deepen. It is hoped that the government authorities will quickly adopt effective policies to relieve the people's suffering.

### Commutation of Sentences for Malfeasance Under Amnesty Act

Nanjing, 26th (Central News Agency) - The National Government Special Court, in accordance with the Amnesty Act promulgated by the National Government this year, has commuted the sentences of all those convicted of crimes before December 31, 1944. Among them, Chen Xiufu, who was convicted of embezzlement of military supplies, had his sentence reduced to one year of imprisonment and a fine of one thousand yuan (the original sentence was two years and six months of imprisonment with a fine of three thousand yuan). Liu Guozhi, Liu Guoshu, Lei Guoqing, Zhang Shiqian, and Xia Yanshan, who were involved in the Wuhan salt administration embezzlement case, each had their sentences reduced to two years and four months of imprisonment, with permanent deprivation of civil rights (the original sentences were all four years of imprisonment). Wang Beishui, Shen Jingfang, Zhou Guangyao, He Bai, Chen Kaizhi, and Feng Zhongyi, who were involved in the Shanghai Special Tax embezzlement case, each had their sentences reduced to two years and four months of imprisonment with a fine of 10,000 yuan (the original sentences were all seven years of imprisonment with a fine of 30,000 yuan). Zhu Lianming, Lin Jianxiang, Hua Guozhong, Zhu Hanshi, and Ma Renji each had their sentences reduced to one year and eight months of imprisonment with a fine of 3,333 yuan (the original sentences were all five years of imprisonment with a fine of 10,000 yuan).

### Shanghai Municipal Construction Public Bonds for the 34th Year of the Republic; National Defense Council Approves Prior Issuance

Nanjing, 26th (Central News Agency) - The Supreme National Defense Council held its 75th meeting on the 26th. Report items: Reading the minutes of the 74th meeting. Discussion items: The chairman submitted a proposal, according to the Executive Yuan's presentation, passed by the Yuan's 260th meeting. According to the Ministry of Finance's presentation, the Shanghai Municipal Government was approved to issue the city's construction public bonds for the 34th year of the Republic, along with the original draft regulations and a table of principal and interest payments, submitted for review. It was decided to pass the proposal and proceed with it first, while still submitting it to the Legislative Yuan for deliberation. The chairman submitted a proposal, according to the Preparatory Committee for the Restoration of the National Central Research Institute, that the committee's preparatory period expired at the end of June of the 34th year of the Republic. Due to the fact that the preparatory work has not yet been completed, it is proposed to extend it for another six months to facilitate progress. It was decided to pass the proposal and send it to the National Government for approval. The chairman submitted a proposal to specially appoint Jiang Xianqi as a member of the National Economic Commission. It was decided to pass the proposal and send it to the National Government.

### Pétain's Trial, Day Three: Daladier Testifies; Lebrun's Testimony Emotionally Charged

Paris, 26th (Central News Agency) - According to news from Paris, yesterday was the third day of Pétain's trial. The atmosphere in the courtroom was extremely solemn. Former French Prime Minister Daladier also appeared in court to give testimony. He had been imprisoned for four years, so his hair and eyebrows were all white. He said, "I want to state the matters related to the armistice agreement and what I heard in prison about General Pétain." The audience in the courtroom was very interested. At that time, Baufre entered the courtroom, seemingly feeling very uncomfortable after five hours of interrogation. Daladier then continued his testimony, saying, "The French Congress formed the Vichy government under the bayonets of the Germans, and at the same time granted the power of the prime minister to Pétain, who often overstepped his authority to handle all government affairs. At that time, the French political system had changed, and the French Republic no longer existed. This new political system gradually emerged under the support of a group of reformers and traitors. At that time, we did not believe in the defeat of France, so on June 20th, we boarded the Massilia ship and left France. We were still at sea when we suddenly heard that the armistice agreement had been signed, so we decided to go to North Africa to gather French patriots to organize a resistance group. We rushed to Rabat to meet with General Noguès, the French Governor of Morocco, to discuss organizing a resistance group, but due to the extreme lack of manpower and material resources, we could only give up. The Massilia ship also returned to the country at that time." Daladier continued to accuse Pétain of usurping judicial power, and on October 13, 1941, he was arrested and secretly tried. Daladier also vehemently denied that the French Republic government handed over the disarmed France to the Germans. He angrily said, "From 1936 to May 1940, the military production of our France increased sharply. At the same time, in 1937 and 1939, the production of German tanks was not stronger than that of our France. At that time, France had more than 3,000 armed aircraft. After the armistice agreement, France had 4,238 aircraft, not including the aircraft in North Africa. On November 8, 1942, when Germany invaded southern France, we hoped very much that Pétain would be driven by patriotism and rise up to resist again. The jury asked Pétain to admit whether he had secretly telegraphed Hitler after the British army bombed the Dieppe area, expressing his desire to cooperate with Hitler and jointly resist the Allied forces. However, the defense lawyer immediately stood up and shouted, "General Pétain has announced that he does not recognize the French court, so he will not answer any questions." Some of the jurors were extremely angry, saying that Pétain's attitude was shameless. Finally, Pétain twisted and turned in his chair, and then said to the jury, "How will I explain? I have not heard a single word of what they said. What do they want me to do?" Therefore, the jury proposed to read aloud Pétain's telegram to Hitler. Pétain had no choice but to break his silence and suddenly stood up and said to the court, "I have already stated that I will not answer any questions on the matter." After he finished speaking, he sat down, his hands trembling, tightly holding his gloves. Seventy-three-year-old Lebrun (the President of France before Pétain seized power) appeared to testify. His voice trembled because of extreme emotional tension, and his expression drew attention from the audience. Most of the trial period passed in his nervous words.

Chuansha is inhabited by ten thousand families. It faces the East China Sea, borders Shanghai Municipality, adjoins Nanhui to the south, and connects to the Pudong North District to the north. The terrain is alluvial coastal land. The river is Sanzao Port. For land transportation, there is the Shangchuan Road small train, from Chuansha to Zhenning Temple in Shanghai Pudong. Water transport consists of small steamships from Shanghai to Chuansha. There used to be small ferries to Nanhui, but they have been suspended due to security concerns. It is now divided into four districts, four towns, and sixteen townships, with over 26,000 households and a population of about 128,000.

### Industry, Commerce, and Finance

The county is a salt-producing area, with seawalls along the coast and abundant production, which is transported and sold to Shanghai and various places. Commerce is influenced by the agricultural aspect, so there are no large capital stores. Recently, due to the insufficient supply of goods and overwhelming burdens, news of store closures is frequently heard. There are only two financial institutions: Hexin Trust Company and Pudong Economic Mutual Aid Society. High-interest lending is rampant. Before, one was overdrawing several times beyond its capital. Before the incident, towels and lace were the main products, and there are still a few towel and homespun factories, employing female workers for spinning and weaving. There are also three small yarn factories.

### Agricultural Products and Land Tax

Farmers' lives are being exploited from all sides, bordering on bankruptcy, and they have no one to turn to. Agricultural products include cotton and wheat, but the yield is not abundant. The annual production is about 70,000 stones, which is not enough for the local food supply. Cotton is about 30,000 dans. Apart from supplying local yarn factories, a small amount is transported to Shanghai. The annual wheat yield is 80,000 dans, and soybeans are over 8,000 dans. The local soil is still fertile, but the farming methods are very old.

The amount of the land tax is estimated at more than 197,400 mu. Due to poor management, the intermediaries embezzle and embezzle, resulting in the amount paid being less than half of the total. The current director, in addition to finding ways to recover the taxes in arrears, is also starting to collect the old land taxes from previous years. From June 1st of this year, it has been ordered to start collecting in kind, estimating about 181,000 mu of first-class fields and 16,400 mu of second-class fields, totaling 197,400 mu. The collection range is from six sheng to one dou. Recently, eight or nine townships have been adjusted and changed to first-class land tax.

### Overview of Education

The education level is very low. Educational facilities are limited due to funding and are makeshift. There are eight complete county primary schools, thirteen junior primary schools, nine registered private schools, and six or seven private schools similar to private tutoring schools. There are no public middle schools, only two private middle schools. The total number of primary and middle school students in the county is about 5,000. But school-age children account for about one-tenth of the population, numbering over 12,000. Apart from those enrolled, the number of out-of-school children reaches 7,000. School funding and teacher treatment are poor. Private schools collect rice. It is said that the county's education funding was originally over 132,000 yuan. This year, the budget has increased by 30%, totaling over 174,000 yuan. In fact, it is difficult to achieve educational success with this amount of money to cope with the crazy prices. It is now heard that another budget is being prepared, requesting additional funding. As for teacher treatment, in addition to a small amount of rice each month, they are given an additional 4,000 to 10,000 yuan. The degree of misery is similar everywhere. For public education, there are two public education centers and agricultural education centers, with a budget of over 17,000 yuan and four or five employees.

### Public Health

In terms of public health, there is one municipal Chuansha clinic, which is directly under the Municipal Health Bureau. However, due to financial constraints, the equipment is simple and rudimentary. In addition to following the instructions of the Municipal Health Bureau to regularly administer vaccinations and treat general diseases, the institute is currently improving the quarantine shelter and plans to expand the clinic into a county hospital. The county government has appointed the director of the clinic to be responsible for the implementation of its funding and equipment. The local people's drug habits are higher, and it is said that drug prohibition matters are particularly important.

### Economic Police Agency Reorganization: Establishment of Economic Section; Merger of Economic Security Section and Economic Police Squad; City Police Department, to reorganize its structure and increase work efficiency, will merge the Fourth Division's Economic Security Section and the Economic Police Squad, reorganizing them into an Economic Section. It will be divided into four groups and four teams, and the areas of jurisdiction for each team will be defined as follows:
Jurisdictional Areas of Each Team:
Economic Police Team 1 (located within the General Bureau): Jurisdiction over the Huangpu, Old Zhabei, New Chen, Yu Temple, and sections of the Dongchang Road branch (north of Dongchang Road and south of Pudong Road).
Economic Police Team 2 (located within the Taishan Road branch): Jurisdiction over the Taishan Road, Xujiahui, Dangtu Road, Fenglai Road, and Xieji Road branches, and sections of the Dongchang Road branch (south of Dongchang Road).
Economic Police Team 3 (located within the Hongkou branch): Jurisdiction over the Hongkou, West Hongkou, Zhabei, North Sichuan Road, Shanghai Railway Station, Xinshi Street, Ti'an Bridge, Yulin Road, and Yangshupu branches, and sections of the Dongchang Road branch (east of Youdong Road).
Economic Police Team 4 (located within the Huashan Road branch): Jurisdiction over the Jiangning Road, Jing'an Temple Road, Putuo Road, Huashan Road, and Changde Road branches, and sections of the Yulin Road branch. As for personnel transfers, former Economic Police Captain Fuda Shigeichi is appointed as the Section Chief of the Fourth Division's Economic Section, and Deputy Captain Yang Guang'an as the Deputy Section Chief. In addition, Deputy Director of the New Chen Branch Yuqi Litoku is transferred to the position of Deputy Director of the Yangshupu Branch, with the vacancy filled by former Deputy Section Chief of the Economic Security Section Kahanaga Nagashige. As for former Economic Security Section Chief Sakatoku Shigemo, due to physical weakness, he is temporarily transferred to become a specialist in the First Division.
Relief for Air Raid Victims in This City: Central Government Allocates Special Funds: A total of 50 million yuan is allocated as relief funds.
Following the enemy's American planes bombing Shanghai's urban areas for several consecutive days, many of our innocent citizens have suffered casualties. Upon hearing the news, the central government expressed its deep concern and yesterday specially allocated 50 million yuan as relief funds.
Police Department Provides Preferential Treatment to Police Officers Killed in Air Raids: The City Police Department, considering that Zhao Guilin, police officer number 1952, first class of the Tilanqiao Branch, bravely performed his duty and died during the enemy air raid on the 17th of this month, which is highly commendable, will, in addition to ordering a separate memorial service, also issue a pension of 1.5 million yuan. According to reports, when the enemy planes attacked on the 17th of this month, Officer Zhao still bravely stood guard, directing the public to take shelter, resulting in him being struck by bullets and dying on duty. The branch bureau held a funeral service for him on the 18th at the Guohua Funeral Home, and a memorial service will be held soon. The Air Defense Headquarters will also give him an award.
Repayment of Funds Borrowed by Consumer Cooperatives: The Shanghai Citizens Welfare Association initiated the organization of a police consumer cooperative (now named the Police Welfare Society) to assist the police bureau two years ago and temporarily borrowed funds from various industry guilds and all sectors of society, with a weekly interest rate of one percent and a repayment period of one year. Secretary-General Luo of the city government has now approved the full repayment. The repayment method is as follows:
From July 30th for one week, will be the repayment date.
Collect money at the Citizen Welfare Association (address: Chinese Red Cross, Xingan Road) with the original receipt.
For principal and interest of 5,000 yuan or less, cash will be paid. For amounts over 5,000 yuan, checks will be issued, and the odd amounts will be rounded off. (Amounts of forty yuan or less will be increased to one hundred yuan).
Those who do not come to collect the money within the specified period will have the money donated to the city's air raid relief fund after the deadline.
Enemy Exaggerated Propaganda Regarding the Results of the Attack on Shanghai: A few days ago, the enemy planes attacked Shanghai, causing minor damage. However, Commander McWhorter's headquarters announced that 300 planes came, sinking three Japanese warships and damaging many other ships and aircraft fields. This is pure fabrication. The enemy's American's absurd and exaggerated propaganda is truly ridiculous. According to investigations, although the enemy planes attempted to bomb Japanese small warships that day, none were hit, and all the bombs fell into the Huangpu River. Only one small sampan was destroyed. This is the truth and is known to all citizens of the city. In particular, the enemy's claim of shooting down 45 Japanese planes is completely inaccurate. The enemy's American has always been known for their nonsensical propaganda, so their boastful claims are not worth laughing at.
Abnormal Prosperity of Various Bank and Money Exchange Businesses in This City; Speculation, Hoarding, and Mortgage Lending Are Increasingly Popular; The business of banks and money exchanges in this city is abnormally prosperous. Although they have made profits in recent years, the normal business conceals a crisis, which is unknown to outsiders. In the past, the main business of various banks and money exchanges was fixed deposits, savings deposits, and industrial and commercial loans. According to a recent investigation, there has been a major change. Legitimate industrial and commercial loans are gradually declining, while speculative stock trading and mortgage loans for nationally-owned goods are becoming increasingly popular, and the interest rates charged are also particularly high. In terms of deposits, fixed deposits and savings deposits have decreased rather than increased and are now at the lowest level. Demand deposits have increased by hundreds of times. In order to attract depositors, some small and medium-sized banks have also specially increased interest rates on demand deposits. In the past, demand deposits did not pay interest, but now it is stipulated that interest be paid.
Security Prices Decline Again: The trading situation in the gold security market yesterday was the same as the previous day. Trading was sluggish, and prices declined, falling by 1 million yuan compared to the previous day. The prices are recorded as follows:
Opening: 10.2 million yuan, Highest: 10.2 million yuan, Lowest: 9.7 million yuan, Closing: 9.7 million yuan, Down 1 million yuan from the previous day, Volume: 15 taels.
Over 4,000 Tons of Coal in Storage Allocated to the Coal Management Society: Since its establishment, the Shanghai Coal Industry Joint Association has been actively working to facilitate the source of coal supplies. However, due to a lack of transportation and difficult transportation, large-scale purchases have not yet achieved the desired results. It is now known that the association, with the cooperation of the Central China Coal Association, has specially allocated a large amount of stored coal to supply industrial production and civilian needs. The details are recorded as follows:
Manufacturing Focus on Coal Balls: The association's allocation of stored coal from the Xingtan Association totals more than 4,000 tons, which will be distributed on a priority basis. In addition to distributing a large part to various factories at parity prices, 1,200 tons will be distributed to the City Economic Bureau at no profit for manufacturing and distribution.
Preparing to Borrow Funds to Purchase Ships: Due to actual needs, the association is preparing to borrow special funds from the Ministry of Finance to purchase ships for transporting coal. It has now submitted a request to the Ministry of Industry to forward it to the Ministry of Finance for approval.
In addition, the Chinese Industrial Association, for the purpose of promoting industrial production and meeting civilian needs, has decided to fully support the association's work.
"Family Doctor" is a Treasure Trove of Common Sense: The Medical Consultant for New Families: Donate 5,000 Yuan and Receive a Free Copy.
Traditionally, books on Chinese medicine have often suffered from two problems: either they are too profound, dry, and boring, or they are excessively Westernized, unsuitable for the local situation, resulting in a lack of practical application. The book "Family Doctor" is compiled by a medical expert who has spent years of effort, describing common diseases that are seen in families, using the principles of Chinese and Western medicine to guide people in correct prevention methods. The writing is lively, simple, and interesting, with refined illustrations, making it even more vivid. Even those without scientific knowledge can understand it clearly and be free from confusion. "Family Doctor" is divided into categories, totaling seventeen chapters and over tens of thousands of words. In more than one hundred and eighty pages, it discusses family life, health, disease prevention and treatment, and nutrition, which is the main focus, accounting for one-fifth of the entire book. It discusses the functions and preservation of vitamins in various foods, and it explains the facts about rice in detail. It advocates eating brown rice and substandard wheat because the outer skin of rice and wheat contains a large amount of Vitamin B, while refined white rice and foreign flour lack essential vitamins. This alone shows the author's keen insights. In addition, topics such as tuberculosis, theories on sexes, venereal diseases, and theories on fetal and child care all have precise and practical advice, making them a valuable reference for general families.
"Family Doctor" encompasses everything, is extremely rich, and is a treasure trove of common sense for Chinese families. It is the medical consultant for Chinese families. Having this book will bring countless benefits. Bayer Pharmaceutical Factory spares no expense (each book costs about 7,000 yuan) to print and distribute 100,000 copies to Shen Bao and the Young Men's and Women's Christian Associations as "Family Doctor Scholarship Funds," and 50,000 copies to news organizations as loan scholarship funds for the "Two Movements," benefiting poor students and the health of families in our country. Their good intentions deserve our highest gratitude!
Commemorating Late Mother Through Thrift and Scholarship Assistance: Mr. Li Jun wrote in a letter: "Today marks the thirteenth anniversary of my late mother's death. Remembering her dedication to social causes during her lifetime, I have specially saved one million yuan to donate to your newspaper's scholarship fund, expressing my intention to assist poor students. I have entrusted Mr. Dang Hai to deliver a check for this amount. I hope you will accept it."
Yonglong Money Exchange Responds to Scholarship Assistance: Yonglong Money Exchange wrote in a letter: "Enclosed are two checks totaling 300,000 yuan. Please use 200,000 yuan to donate to the air raid relief fund and 100,000 yuan to donate to your newspaper's ordinary scholarship assistance team. This is a small contribution, but I hope it will serve as an example to encourage others. As your newspaper said, if hundreds of banks and money exchanges each donate to one team, the total amount of scholarship assistance will be sufficient immediately."

We sincerely hope that everyone will continue to do their best and not lag behind in good deeds. We also hope everyone will be the first to contribute generously, so that the scholarship assistance movement will surely be more effective with less effort. Mr. Li Qingmou's filial piety is commendable. To commemorate his late mother, he saved one million yuan and donated it to the assistance fund. He is both righteous and virtuous, which is truly rare. Mr. Cao Zhiqing, Jiyi, and Wufeng Trading Company also each donated one million yuan and were included in the honorary team. We are extremely grateful. We also commend and admire the efforts of Mr. Ma Defu, Zhu Xuan, He Qiyu, Hefeng Xieji and Associates, Song Ji and Associates, Zhang Bingzhen, and Zhu Qing, who each sponsored a team.

Household Grains: Decision to Distribute in Stages: Three Types: Corn, Sorghum, and Dried Sweet Potatoes.
The City Economic Bureau, concerned that rising grain prices are significantly affecting the livelihoods of citizens, previously approved the City Miscellaneous Grain Industry Association to hold ten phases of fair-priced miscellaneous grain sales, which were well received by middle and lower-class citizens. Therefore, the bureau has recently been working hard to liaise with relevant parties to obtain a batch of miscellaneous grains, including corn, sorghum, and dried sweet potatoes. It has been decided to distribute these grains in stages to households in the city to improve their food supply.
Although this batch of miscellaneous grains is limited, the method of distribution in stages has been finalized. The bureau has notified the associations of rice retailers in each district and each rice retailer to prepare for payment and delivery of goods. Once the goods are received, a public announcement will be made in the newspaper.

National Forum: A Humble Proposal for Entertainment Venues to Accommodate Refugees by Ji Gu: This city has been devastated by air raids for days. It goes without saying that countless civilians have been killed and injured in the affected areas. Most of those who survived have fled to the former One-Eight districts. These people are mostly from the working class. Their original homes and assets have been destroyed in one day, and they have no relatives or friends to rely on, resulting in them living a homeless and miserable existence. Relief and accommodation are urgently needed. Looking around this city, the various dance halls and entertainment venues are still full of lavish spending. This phenomenon not only goes against the principle of mutual assistance among people but is also not allowed during wartime austerity. The authorities and various sectors are currently planning relief work for disaster victims in various ways. If the entertainment venues are temporarily converted into refugee shelters, it would serve both purposes. I dare to offer this humble suggestion for reference.
Using Savings to Relieve Air Raid Victims: We received letters from enthusiastic people from all walks of life, all of whom are donating their savings to help air raid victims. Excerpts are as follows:
The staff of Jihuatang Pharmacy wrote: "Every summer, businesses usually give out watermelon money to their employees so they can buy watermelons to relieve the summer heat. This year, watermelons are extremely expensive. If one wants to enjoy them a little, the cost would be considerable. The staff of our store, in view of the current intense air raids and the large number of deaths and injuries, and the urgent need for first aid medicines and materials for burials, believe that this consumption can be saved. Therefore, we have decided to send this money to your organization. We intend to use half of it for the air raid relief fund and half to forward it to the Pushan Villa, in order to inspire responses from all sectors. Enclosed is a check for one million yuan. Please accept it."
Mr. Xue Bingchu wrote: "Recent bombings have been devastating, and the affected areas are getting larger and larger. The number of disaster victims is also increasing. Our innocent civilians are suffering this unprovoked disaster. It is heartbreaking. I hope that people in society will embrace the principle of helping each other in times of need and generously contribute to promote post-disaster relief work. The feeling of compassion is inherent in everyone. We should use our savings or do what we can to help with relief. Enclosed is a draft for 700,000 yuan, and a student, Xu Shangyun, has also attached 520,000 yuan. Please donate them to the air raid relief fund. Also, donate 200,000 yuan to the Puhua Villa. Please accept and transfer them accordingly."
Reader Yang Jieming wrote: "This city is suffering from air raids more and more every day. Disaster victims are displaced, and there are many deaths and injuries. Since we are all compatriots, how can we sit idly by? We should do our part to help. To respond to this situation, we have collected 600,000 yuan. Please forward it to the relief authorities as soon as possible. Although it is a drop in the bucket, it will not solve the problem. It is important to know that many a little makes a mickle. We hope that all kind-hearted people in Shanghai will respond enthusiastically and donate generously with the spirit of perseverance. Then the amount will be considerable, and disaster victims will benefit a lot."
News from All Sectors Regarding Disaster Relief:
Jinkang Pharmacy Donates Red Potion: Jinkang Pharmacy wrote: "This city has recently suffered air raids. There have been many deaths and injuries. It is a heartbreaking sight. Our pharmacy is deeply concerned and has specially selected and purchased five pounds of Lighthouse Brand standard red potion. Please deliver it to the rescue agency. Standard red potion is made with Lighthouse Brand pigments. It has excellent sterilizing and disinfecting effects. This is a small contribution, but it expresses our sincere concern. We hope that businesses in this city will continue to donate generously. We look forward to it."
Zhenru Clinic Sets Up First Aid Station: Due to the frequent air raids in recent days, the Zhenru Town Clinic has specially set up a first aid station, and everything is ready. They are now urgently seeking bandages, gauze, cotton, first aid medicines, and old blankets. We hope that fellow Zhenru natives in Shanghai will donate generously. Collection points: Zhenguang Elementary School in Zhenru and Tongchang Rice Shop in Nicheng Bridge, Shanghai.
