[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 23rd] Chairman Chiang, accompanied by his wife, departed Nanjing by special plane at 9:30 AM on the 23rd, flying to Chongqing. Military Advisor General Shang, Bureau Chief Yu, and Secretary-General Xiangjian followed along. Previously, the Chairman had instructed that this not be made known externally, to spare the millions of citizens the trouble of seeing them off and to save on security measures. Leaders from all circles of the party, government, and military in Nanjing, understanding the Chairman's intentions, only had Mayor Ma go to the airport to represent them in seeing him off.

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 23rd] Chairman Chiang, accompanied by his wife, Military Advisor General Shang Zhen, Foreign Minister Wang Shijie, Bureau Chief Yu Jishi, and others, returned to Chongqing this morning at 10:35 AM on two separate airplanes. The Chairman's plane circled above Wuhan for a week, inspecting the area, before safely landing at Jiulongpo Airport at 2:40 PM. The Chairman and his wife then took a military vehicle to their official residence to rest. Following the victory of the War of Resistance, this was the Chairman's first inspection of the old capital and the capital city, staying in Beiping for eight days from the 11th and in Nanjing for six days from the 18th. Wherever the Chairman went, he received a warm welcome from the people.

[United Press, Chongqing, 23rd] Special Envoy Marshall, after arriving in Chongqing yesterday, was accompanied by Premier of the Executive Yuan Song Ziwen to his residence in Jialing Village. He then dined with U.S. Chargé d'Affaires Robertson and several others. Mr. Marshall went to bed immediately after the meal last night due to fatigue from the journey. Besides some foreign reporters, there were no other guests visiting. Mr. Schupple, a member of Marshall's staff, said that Mr. Marshall was not yet aware of the sad news of the death of Lieutenant General Patton, former commander of the U.S. Third Army, in Europe. Mr. Marshall is residing in a residence belonging to a certain national bank, which is perfectly equipped with heating and cooling, steel-framed windows, and tiled floors, making it a rare find in Chongqing. Former U.S. Representative Willkie, former U.S. Vice President Wallace, and other American dignitaries have visited Chongqing.

[Another Dispatch] The residence of U.S. Special Envoy Marshall is not yet fully arranged, but it is known that he will be invited to attend the Christmas Eve dinner hosted by Chairman Chiang and his wife. According to Schupple, the special envoy intends to decline all social engagements within possible limits and devote himself to his important mission. Accompanying Mr. Marshall are Colonel Searle, Military Attaché, and attendants Hick, Saul, and Juen. How long Mr. Marshall will stay in China is currently unpredictable, and may depend on the development of the political and military situation in China. If China can achieve peace and unification as soon as possible, then Mr. Marshall's stay in China may be shortened.

[Another Dispatch] Chairman Chiang and his wife arrived in Chongqing this afternoon. The Chairman is expected to meet with U.S. Special Envoy Marshall tonight or tomorrow morning for their first conversation. According to a statement from Marshall's adjutant, Communist Party representatives Zhou Enlai, Ye Jianying, and Dong Biwu paid a visit to Special Envoy Marshall today to pay their respects and exchange friendly opinions. The conversation lasted one hour, with the special envoy mostly listening and talking little. This is the first time that representatives of the Chinese Communist Party have presented their views to the American ambassador.

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 23rd] British Prime Minister's Representative to China, General Wyatt, visited Special Envoy Marshall at 11:30 AM on the 23rd. According to Special Envoy's Secretary Schupple, Marshal Marshall will host reporters on the morning of the 24th, so he does not intend to issue any statements today.

### Before Leaving Nanjing, Summoning Responsible Individuals to Instruct on Municipal Improvements, Inspecting Various Parts of the City Lightly and Simply

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 23rd] Chairman Chiang, accompanied by his wife, has already departed Nanjing this morning to return to Chongqing. Although the Chairman's stay in Nanjing was only five days, the spiritual warmth he gave to the compatriots in the capital and southeastern regions was like the result of his inspection of Beiping, which cannot be estimated by numbers alone. This can be seen in the daily conversations of people in Nanjing and the joyful and encouraging remarks in Shanghai newspapers. During his five-day stay in Nanjing, the Chairman paid respects at the Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum, met with Special Envoy Marshall, and gave instructions to the military and political leaders from various regions who came to Nanjing to pay their respects. He also took time to inspect the city several times. On the 20th, he inspected various places in the mausoleum area simply and lightly. On the 21st, he went to Wutaishan to visit the (Shinto Shrine) built by the Japanese army and summoned Mayor Ma Chaojun there to instruct on municipal construction. On the 22nd, he visited Linggu Temple again and gave alms to the monks. Then, he went outside Guanghua Gate, where, in addition to inspecting the airfield, he seemed to have commemorated the battles of the defense of Nanjing. On the evening before his departure, he summoned the responsible personnel of the party, government, and military in the capital to have dinner together. During the dinner, he earnestly instructed that Nanjing, as the capital of China, which attracts worldwide attention, must focus on tidying up the city and cultivating a new spirit, which is an essential task in the reconstruction. He then listed various points, giving detailed instructions. It is said that he also issued several handwritten orders to Mayor Ma, specifically pointing out: (1) Zhongshan Road must be completely repaired; (2) the gate towers of Zhongshan Gate and Yijiang Gate must be rebuilt; (3) the water supply and drainage system must be improved; (4) the slogans in the city should be improved. After receiving the order, the municipal authorities are currently planning to implement it. In addition, the five petition boxes set up by the Chairman's office in Nanjing have received a large number of letters from the public in the past three days, and the moving stories among them are no less than those in Beiping. Before the Chairman's departure, he also sent Deputy Secretary-General Zheng Yanfen to stay in Nanjing to handle the closing matters. The eagerness of the Chairman in seeking the people's well-being has inspired the elders of Nanjing. Also, the gentle and approachable attitude of the Chairman's wife during her five-day stay in Nanjing has left the deepest impression on the tens of thousands of men, women, old and young in Nanjing. On the 20th, the wife quietly traveled incognito and had a small meal at the Dahua Chun Restaurant in Confucius Temple. Within a few minutes, the crowd outside the door gathered and was impassable, all vying to see the wife. After finishing the meal and leaving the door, she comforted the elderly and young, frequently greeting them, lasting for more than ten minutes before waving her scarf and getting into the car amidst cheers.

### Liu Duoquan Is About to Go to Chengde - The Soviet and Mongolian Troops Scattered Within the Territory Have Withdrawn

[Special Dispatch from This Newspaper, Beiping, 22nd] Amid the acceptance of the Northeast, being thrown into the cracks between the internal affairs and diplomacy of the Northeast and China, seems to have been forgotten. Two months ago, General Liu Duoquan, who originally wanted to go to the Northeast from Dongchun to take over, had already flown back to Beiping for the winter. The members of the Rehe Provincial Government Committee are also here sightseeing, but they all hope that after the Northeast issue is resolved, they will be able to enter Chengde as soon as possible. Chairman Liu also plans to go to Chengde in mid-next month to deploy everything. Rehe originally belonged to the Twelfth War Zone. Due to the current situation, Sun Lanfeng, the commander of the advance troops of the Twelfth War Zone who was originally preparing to enter Rehe, has flown back to Gui Sui. In the future, military affairs will be shared by the Beiping Pacification Headquarters and the Northeast Pacification Headquarters, but financial, transportation, and administrative aspects will be consistent with the provinces of the Northeast. General Du Yuming, who is actually responsible for the military affairs of Rehe, recently told reporters that after the acceptance of the Northeast, we will have a solution for Rehe. The Soviet and Mongolian troops within Rehe have withdrawn last month. Currently, most of the garrison troops are local Communist forces. The acceptance of Rehe is no longer a diplomatic issue.

### Snow-Covered Changchun Becomes Two Major Events - The Formal Acceptance of Municipal Administration and the Opening of the Bank of China

[Central News Agency, Changchun, 22nd] Today, there are two major events here. One is the opening of the Bank of China, and the other is the acceptance of the municipal administration. These two historically significant events have brought a strong sense of spring to the snow-covered Changchun. Although some citizens did not foresee that Changchun would suddenly change its era overnight, the vehicles and horses in front of the two huge buildings in Daguan Square, and the flags of the Party and the country, gave them a clear indication. The Bank of China opened at 9:00 AM. Three hours later, the new mayor arrived. The crowds of well-wishers, including the military delegation of the Northeast Pacification Headquarters, the Foreign Affairs Commissioner's Office, the Air Force Headquarters, military and political personnel, directors and supervisors of the Changchun Railway, local gentry, and the Soviet Commercial Director, the manager of the Soviet Far East Bank, and Marshal Ma's economic advisor, the deputy commander of the city defense, etc., all proceeded to the city government after having tea and refreshments at the Bank of China. No ceremony was held for the opening of the Bank of China or the acceptance of the municipal administration. The guests and hosts met, and laughter arose, revealing heartfelt joy. Citizens in the streets talked about our government and our bank. Their accumulated depression of the past fourteen years is now rapidly disappearing, replaced by infinite warmth and anticipation. The "Changchun" in history has now begun its supreme true meaning.

[Central News Agency, Changchun, 22nd] The branch of the Central Bank officially opened at 9:00 AM this morning. Chairman Zhang of the Economic Commission sent a special envoy to offer tea and refreshments to the guests at the bank. Mr. Zhang also spoke to the press, explaining the mission of the Central Bank and the significance of issuing banknotes for circulation in nine provinces. These banknotes have now begun to circulate. What was seen today was the 50-yuan note. The other four types will be released after they are delivered. The 50-yuan note has a purple pattern and a photo of the Customs on the front. Guests rushed to exchange them and asked Chairman Zhang and Central Bank staff to sign them as souvenirs. A few minutes after the bank opened, a large number of deposits flowed in. The first account was the Bank of China's one million yuan. Mr. Wei Xijiu is temporarily acting as the manager of the Central Bank, and Wang Yujing and Hu Zhaoying are also acting as deputy managers. The daily business hours are temporarily set from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM.

[Another Dispatch] After taking office, Mayor Zhao revealed three basic policy guidelines, all of which were indicated by Chairman Chiang: (1) Establish a good political foundation. (2) Strengthen economic construction. (3) Improve the people's cultural standards. Mr. Zhao also emphasized the friendly relations between China and the Soviet Union, saying: In the future, we will strive to promote good relations between the two countries. Mr. Zhao studied in Japan and the United States for a total of eleven years. After returning to China, he served in the military and political circles for seventeen years, serving as a member of the Second National Political Council, Mayor of Hengyang, and commander of the garrison. During the January 28th Incident, Mr. Zhao served as the head of the tax regiment and led his troops to bravely resist the Japanese in the Shanghai area, repeatedly making meritorious contributions.

### The National Army Recovers the Northeast - Advances on Four Routes - Air Transportation Is Extremely Large

[This Newspaper, Beiping, 22nd] The National Army's air transportation to the Northeast will begin within the week. Fifth Division Commander Li Zefen has returned to Beiping from Changchun today to prepare to discuss the air transportation of the division to Changchun. It is reported that the scale of this air transportation of the National Army to the Northeast will be extremely large, and the completion time will be very fast. Therefore, the preparation period is also longer, causing people to feel impatient.

[This Newspaper News] San Francisco Radio broadcasted on the 23rd that the Du Yuming troops who landed at Huludao yesterday were directly transported by the U.S. Seventh Fleet transport ships from Haiphong.

[United Press, Beiping, 23rd] The National Army's recovery of the nine northeastern provinces is becoming more and more clear. The liaison group is advancing towards four targets, and other troops have been airlifted to Changchun this week, and the deployment has been completed. According to news from Jinzhou, the railway section from Goubangzi to Xinmin had been destroyed by the Communist army but has now been repaired. The National Army has advanced along the line to Qingduizi, waiting to meet with the Soviet military liaison officer. The two sides will hold a meeting in Xinmin to discuss the detailed arrangements for accepting the Northeast. The second liaison group is advancing towards Fuxin in the north, the third liaison group is advancing towards the central part of Rehe Province, and its ultimate goal is Chifeng in the northern part of the province; the fourth group is advancing from the southwest and will contact the Soviet army in Panshan. The movement of the Soviet liaison group indicates that the Chinese and Soviet representatives in Changchun have made decisive progress. Other factors, such as the landing of the headquarters troops at Huludao, carrying 465 trucks and cars to enhance their strength, are also encouraging. The National Army advanced ninety miles from Huludao to contact General Du Yuming at the Jinzhou Headquarters. The air transportation of the 94th Army to Changchun can begin this week and can be completed in a short period of time.

### The Country Will Be Divided Into Nine Telecommunications Zones - Supplementing the Postal Network

In terms of telecommunications, it has been decided not to divide the country into nine telecommunications zones according to political regions. Each zone will have a management bureau.

### Beiping and Tianjin Continue to Arrest Japanese War Criminals - Twenty People Have Been Captured, Mostly Liaison Officers, Police Officers, and Military Police - Honma and Others Have Been Detained in the Garrison Headquarters

[This Newspaper, Beiping, 22nd] The full list of 120 Japanese war criminals to be arrested in Beiping has been handed over to the Japanese Liaison Department for Execution of Post-War Matters for execution. Twenty people have now been captured and detained in the garrison headquarters. The rest are still being arrested, and some have fled. Most of the arrested war criminals are liaison officers, police officers, and military police. Among them, the more high-ranking ones are Honma Seiu, head of the Tianjin Army Liaison Department, and  Yūhei, head of the Army Liaison Department. Although their positions were high, they committed many crimes against the people on a daily basis. Now, they are in the detention center, and their meals are no different from those of our soldiers. They can also communicate with the outside world, which can be said to be quite comfortable and free. However, some war criminals complained about the lack of heating as soon as they entered the detention center. They seem to have forgotten the cruel torture they used to inflict on the Chinese people not long ago, such as pouring cold water into their noses.

### The Relief Administration Announces - Relief Plan for China

[United Press, Washington, 23rd] Lehman, Director of the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, announced today: The cost of the relief plan for China, including Korea, totals $675 million. This is the largest amount since the establishment of the Administration. China has been ravaged by war for fourteen years, and its need for relief is shocking. In the relief work in China, careful consideration will be given to making the best use of all available resources to help the Chinese government and its people as much as possible. Lehman said: "The Dunren Envoy Mission has been in China for more than a year, and now we are accelerating the implementation of the plan. The large amount of supplies delivered to the coastal ports will be transported inland as soon as the transportation is restored." He continued: "Korea will become one of the fifteen administrative districts of the relief plan for China." The full announcement of the financial distribution of the relief effort needs to be made for the first time. Mr. Lehman said: "The funds may be changed due to changes in the situation. The total cost is $377,660,000, of which $35.1 million is for administrative expenses, $55.5 million is for branch expenses, $19.1 million is for use in dealing with unemployed people, and the remainder will be distributed to the following countries for relief, in addition to China: Albania $30 million, the Soviet Union $60 million, Czechoslovakia $31.5 million, Greece $45 million, Italy $49 million, Yugoslavia $51.9 million, Dodecanese Islands, Abyssinia, etc. $37.8 million, and $18.5 million is reserved for emergency relief projects." Lehman declared: "Because the funds donated by the United States have been allocated, the relief work in Europe and Asia can be greatly accelerated. The Relief Administration has saved the lives of hundreds of thousands of people and will continue to rescue a large number of refugees, but if we want to provide universal relief without any omissions, the funds, food, medicine, clothing, etc. are still insufficient. It is said that at the previous meeting in London, it was necessary to complete the relief work by the end of 1946, and in the Pacific region by the spring of 1947." He concluded: "Of the thirty-one countries in the Relief Administration, all have donated except for Guatemala and Liberia."

### Liberty Ships and Landing Craft Will Be Transferred to China by the United States

[United Press, Nanjing, 23rd] Vice Admiral Barbey, Commander of the U.S. Seventh Fleet Amphibious Forces, stayed in Nanjing for one day and twice called on Chairman Chiang to discuss important matters. He left Nanjing for Shanghai this morning. He smiled and said to the reporters, "I had a good night's sleep at Premier Song Ziwen's private residence. The comfort of the bed made me reluctant to leave. Special Envoy Marshall also stayed here yesterday, so why can't I stay here?"

[Associated Press, Nanjing, 22nd] (Delayed) Rear Admiral Barbey revealed today that during his meeting with Chairman Chiang here, it was agreed to transfer six Liberty ships and an unspecified number of tank landing craft to the Chinese government, which will then be operated by Chinese crews, mainly for sending Japanese soldiers and civilians back to their country. These ships are currently unloading their last consignment of troops to North China and the Northeast. As soon as the work is completed, the Liberty ships will return to Shanghai for transfer to Chinese crews. Chinese crew members who will operate the tank landing craft are currently training in Qingdao, where 60 U.S. sailors are teaching 600 Chinese crew members. The future plan is to train Chinese crew members to operate all types of amphibious vehicles, because these vehicles are surplus in the United States and are suitable for use on the Chinese coast and inland rivers. Since Liberty ships belong to merchant ships, their transfer to China does not require congressional approval. The gun positions and other wartime equipment on Liberty ships and tank landing craft will be dismantled. Mr. Barbey said: During his meeting with Chairman Sun this afternoon, he discussed general issues related to Chinese shipping, but said that he could not discuss other assistance transportation requirements other than Liberty ships and tank landing craft. The crew training plan was proposed by Chairman Chiang.

### Situation of the Political Consultative Conference. All Parties Advocate for Openness, Zhu De Refuses to Lay Down Arms Immediately

[This Newspaper, Chongqing, 22nd] Regarding the situation and content of the discussions at the Political Consultative Conference, all parties advocate for openness and allowing newspaper reporters to attend and report the news to satisfy the concerns of all parties. The newspapers are currently negotiating with the relevant authorities on this matter, but it is heard that the authorities in charge are still considering this approach.

[This Newspaper Report] San Francisco, 23rd Broadcast: It is heard that the relationship between the Communist Party representatives in Chongqing and the Kuomintang is very harmonious. Last night, the U.S. Information Service held a dance party in Chongqing, which Zhou Enlai and Wu Guozhen attended. A certain American female reporter praised Mr. Zhou Enlai's dancing skills. [United Press, Yan'an, 23rd] Commander-in-Chief of the Communist Army, Zhu De, stated: The Communist armies in the areas of Baotou, Gui Sui, and Datong have been ordered to withdraw as an expression of the Communist Party's hope for peace. As for other plans of the Communist Party, they can be described as follows: (1) The delegation of the Communist Party to the Political Consultative Conference is fully authorized to immediately discuss with the U.S. Special Envoy, Marshall, the matters of ceasing the civil war and establishing a coalition government. (2) The Communist Party suggests an immediate and unconditional ceasefire for two weeks. (3) Once peace is restored and a coalition government is established, the Communist Party is prepared to disband all units except for the twenty divisions that have been agreed upon to be retained. (4) The newly established coalition government welcomes the 2 billion U.S. dollars in loans from the United States to develop domestic industry, provided that it does not hinder the independent development of China's economy. Zhu De also stated that since U.S. President Truman has announced his support for an early end to the civil war in China, he is very optimistic about the Political Consultative Conference. When asked how the Communist army would be reorganized, he replied that once the coalition government is established, the Communist army can be reasonably and fairly incorporated into the National Army, but it is inappropriate to ask the Communist army to lay down its arms at present, as this would be a surrender, not a solution.

[Central News Agency, Xi'an, 22nd] In order to carry out the attack on the counties of the First Administrative District of Shaanxi, the Communist Party recently ordered the Sui De Sub-district of the Eighteenth Army Group and the Joint Defense Command to convene a joint defense meeting.

[United Press, Moscow, 23rd] Well-informed sources announced today that the Three Foreign Ministers Conference has made considerable achievements, and the restoration of the spirit of wartime cooperation is one of them. U.S. Secretary of State Byrnes considers this to be a major achievement, but British Foreign Secretary Bevin is not as optimistic about the final outcome.

[Reuters, Moscow, 23rd] The Three-Power Conference continues to bring good news. The optimism in Moscow diplomatic circles has not been greater than this since the end of the war. Although the content of the talks remains tightly guarded, yesterday's meeting was held in Molotov's office in the Kremlin. An observer said yesterday that after the abolition of formalities, the meeting progressed unusually rapidly. The U.S. side also revealed yesterday that the meeting may end at Christmas. The British representative was unable to make such a prediction but also acknowledged that the end would be earlier than expected. The foreign ministers do not necessarily have to step up their work to quickly reach an agreement. The official announcement of the purpose of this meeting is "exploratory," to eliminate misunderstandings and to broadly study various international issues. Although there have been optimistic reports about the Moscow conference from time to time, Washington said yesterday that the Soviet Union's attitude toward Turkey and Iran is difficult to deal with, but related parties should still strive to mediate to avoid serious adverse effects on the General Assembly of the United Nations.

[U.S. Information Service, Moscow, 23rd] The French Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Catroux, discussed with Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov yesterday the French proposal for the international co-management of the Rhine and Ruhr regions of Germany.

The U.S. plan includes two steps: first, to abolish the boundaries between the U.S. and Soviet occupation zones to complete the social and economic unification of Korea. Second, the trusteeship period will be jointly participated in by the U.S., Britain, the Soviet Union, and China. Political figures here said that this is only the solution proposed by the U.S., and the U.S. government may also be prepared to discuss other proposals.

### Christmas Odds and Ends

[U.S. Information Service, Washington, 23rd] President Truman delivered a short speech while lighting the Christmas tree, briefly stating: "This year's Christmas is a holiday that the whole world has looked forward to for many terrible years. Peace brings joy. As we light the Christmas tree again now, the gloomy years of war have passed... We should remember the spirit of Christmas, which is the spirit of peace, and the spirit of love for all mankind. ... Our enemies have now been overcome, and we should step up our efforts for our future work. We cannot fail, nor can we change our purpose. No country can ever again wage war against other countries."

[United Press, New York, 22nd] Americans are preparing to celebrate their first peaceful Christmas in five years, spending money like water to buy gifts, and sales are unprecedentedly strong. Most stores have sold out of goods. According to retailers, customers are willing to pay high prices for gifts whenever they come to the door. Whiskey, which is usually bought at the last minute, is also very difficult to find. Scotch and bourbon are almost sold out. Inferior whiskey has risen from $3.50 to $4.50 per bottle, which is almost double the pre-war price. French brandy has risen from $7 to $9 per bottle, and some have risen from $15 to $20. Women's underwear is one of the main Christmas gifts, and the price has risen from $3 to $7. Shirts were not easy to get during the war, and the price has risen from $1.50 to $2.50. Although children's toys are well-stocked, they are very expensive and mostly made of wood, but buyers are still very enthusiastic. The money saved from military work savings and veterans' pensions can be used to spend as much as possible. However, the prices of books, gramophone records, and cosmetics remain unchanged. It can be seen that Americans' spending is not entirely without purpose.

[United Press, Uraga, 23rd] Christmas is just around the corner, and Americans may have a sense of being far away from the war, but here on the pier, starving Japanese soldiers can still be seen fainting on the ground. These soldiers were originally garrison troops on Palau Island and have now been disarmed and sent back home, returning to a country with a bleak future.

Nurses injected medicine and then used stretchers to carry them onto trucks.

### The Question of the Japanese Emperor's Remaining in Office, Abdicating or Not, Depends on the Japanese People, MacArthur Does Not Intend to Add War Crime Charges

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 21st Special Dispatch] According to authoritative sources speaking to the Central News Agency, unless new evidence is obtained proving the emperor guilty, or MacArthur receives instructions from the highest authority based on Allied public opinion, MacArthur does not intend to add the name of war criminal to Japanese Emperor Hirohito or force him to abdicate. Rumors are rife here that the emperor will be listed as a war criminal, and some unconfirmed reports believe that the emperor's abdication is to avoid the imperial system being tainted by war crimes. Former Minister of the Imperial Household, Matsumoto Kanchiro, who is now one of the emperor's advisors, told the Central News Agency reporter a few days ago after meeting with Minister of the Imperial Household, Ishiwatari Shotaro, that he was unaware of any discussions between MacArthur's headquarters and the Japanese Imperial Household regarding war crimes and abdication. Furthermore, MacArthur has never had any opinions on Emperor Hirohito and the imperial system. Prince Takamatsu, the emperor's younger brother, also made similar statements yesterday. It is generally believed that if the emperor abdicates, Prince Mikasa will most likely become regent, because Prince Mikasa is currently suffering from lung disease, and because Prince Mikasa had some dealings with the Japanese warlords after the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War and disagreed with Hirohito. It is reported that during Emperor Hirohito's historic audience with MacArthur, he told MacArthur that the emperor's power could not be implemented and requested the personal privilege to represent the will of the Japanese people in 1941. It is reported that the emperor told MacArthur at the time that under the support of the warlords, there was no other way but to launch a war. This secret meeting is generally considered satisfactory. Among the various instructions imposed by MacArthur on the Japanese government is the elimination of the separation between the emperor and his subjects, even if he does not remain a puppet of the government for many years. Currently, the power of the warlords and other powers have been eliminated, the cunning Konoe Fumimaro has committed suicide, and Kido Koichi is also in prison. Hirohito can exercise his imperial power. MacArthur's recent abolition of the government's instructions related to the Shinto religion can also be interpreted as preventing the emperor from being obstructed by Shintoism and can focus on being a righteous person. Senior officials at MacArthur's headquarters hinted that if the emperor can have the foresight to solve the rice shortage and unemployment problems and follow the democratic system that MacArthur has imposed on Japan, so that the Japanese people can obtain a reasonable and perfect government, then the emperor and his system can be permanently maintained. At the same time, they warned that if the emperor is still confused at this time of crisis and cannot exercise his imperial power, a revolution will occur, forcing him to abdicate, and the imperial system will be eradicated. The emperor has decided to meet with Japanese reporters starting in the next ten days. This is the beginning of the emperor's desire to understand public opinion. For decades, due to the planned actions of warlords and conspirators, he has been unable to meet with the people, and separation has arisen. However, the cabinet is weak and incompetent, and the parliament is following suit, and the emperor cannot benefit his subjects. It is believed that if it is now stipulated that politicians who are unqualified and difficult to agree with cannot participate in the future general election, the current situation can be remedied in case of emergency, but the formation of a new cabinet is also a major problem at present. Recently, it has been rumored here that the Japanese Imperial Household has prepared to request MacArthur's approval for the emperor's abdication, and MacArthur hopes to continue to occupy Japan, abide by the surrender terms, and implement them. The emperor himself hopes to leave the matter of abdication to the Japanese people to decide.

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 23rd Special Dispatch] The Japanese small newspaper Minpō commented on the emperor's meeting with Japanese reporters, saying: Ultimately, the emperor's audience is not a real meeting. In this democratic century, if the emperor's contact with the people is appropriate, then why can't the people have a real meeting with the emperor?

### The United States Used Missiles in the War Against Japan

Hundreds of Japanese Ships Were Sunk

[This Newspaper Report] San Francisco, 23rd Broadcast: The U.S. Navy Department recently revealed for the first time that in the final stages of the war against Japan, the United States used secret weapons. This weapon is a radar-controlled missile. Hundreds of Japanese ships were sunk in the Pacific, making it the only successful automatic bomb in the war. This type of missile is twelve feet long, can carry heavy explosives, and has the same speed as ordinary aircraft. It is launched from naval aircraft and controlled by radar. It can fly directly to its destination. When it arrives, the Japanese are always caught off guard and call it a bat. On one occasion, two U.S. aircraft used radar to discover two Japanese ships anchored twenty miles away. They then approached to determine whether they were Japanese ships. The Japanese responded with anti-aircraft fire. The U.S. aircraft moved away from the range of the anti-aircraft fire and then launched missiles, immediately hitting one of them. The other ship continued to fire anti-aircraft fire, believing that a real aircraft had arrived.

### General Lo Cho-ying Visits Hong Kong; A Prelude to Sino-British Friendship and Cooperation Between Hong Kong and Guangdong

—Special Correspondent for this Newspaper, Liang Feng

Guangdong and Hong Kong are closely linked, like lips and teeth. There is a need for mutual benefit and assistance in matters such as transportation, economics, and overseas Chinese affairs. Chairman Lo Cho-ying of the Guangdong Provincial Government, in order to promote Sino-British relations and the relationship between Hong Kong and Guangdong, and to observe how the British authorities in Hong Kong are revitalizing Hong Kong and Kowloon, so as to draw lessons from them; at the same time, because many overseas Chinese who failed to escape after Hong Kong fell into enemy hands struggled and remained loyal under the oppression of the enemy's iron heel, which is a matter of great concern to Chairman Lo, at 6:30 AM on the 10th of December, Chairman Lo, accompanied by Provincial Government Committee members Huang Wenshan and Xiao Ciwo, and more than a dozen staff members, traveled by express train on the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway to Hong Kong for an unofficial visit to the Hong Kong authorities and to comfort the overseas Chinese in Hong Kong and Kowloon.

Chairman Lo is a well-rounded and famous general who has fought hundreds of battles. This was his first time leading an expeditionary force abroad, achieving extraordinary success. His glorious achievements are already deeply admired by the overseas Chinese. Moreover, after the victory of the war, they can openly welcome the leaders of our country there, just as they would see a long-lost family head, which makes them feel honored, joyful, and excited.

Overseas Chinese Offer Flowers

The train arrived at 3:00 PM. Hong Kong Governor Rear Admiral Harcourt, British Army Commander Major General Fitzwilliam, and our welcoming guests: Chen Su, Director of the Kuomintang General Branch in Hong Kong and Macau, Wu Hougong, representative of the Central Propaganda Department, Zhong Yunan, representative of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' Special Commissioner for Guangdong and Guangxi, Wang Yifu, representative of the Hong Kong and Kowloon Branch of the Youth Corps and male and female members of the Youth Corps, Zhong E, Special Commissioner for the Fujian and Guangdong Region of the Ministry of Finance, and overseas Chinese leaders Dong Zhongwei and Guo Zan, as well as representatives from various community organizations, more than a thousand people in all, were already standing on the platform with smiles to welcome them. After Chairman Lo and others got off the train, they shook hands with the Governor, Major General Fitzwilliam, and all the representatives, exchanging greetings. The Governor and Major General Fitzwilliam had smiles on their faces, appearing very happy, unlike the usual reserved British military personnel.

After Chairman Lo reviewed the British Royal Guard of Honor, he and the Governor proceeded to review the Youth Corps members waiting to welcome them and accepted flowers from the overseas Chinese in Hong Kong and Kowloon. These young people were physically strong and full of energy. Chairman Lo nodded frequently, seemingly deeply commending these masters of the new China to be built in the future.

Time was running late, so Chairman Lo and the Governor boarded a specially prepared motorboat to cross the sea. At 6:00 PM, the Governor hosted a cocktail reception, and Chairman Lo was hosted by the Governor that night and stayed at the Government House.

Unprecedented Grand Gathering

The Chairman left the Governor's residence and, accompanied by his staff, inspected the Kuomintang General Branch in Hong Kong and Macau and the Hong Kong and Kowloon Branch of the Youth Corps, and visited the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce. Then he went to the military representative group to meet with Generals Mo Xingshuo, Pan Huaguo, and Zhou Yanbin, and together they visited the Eastern Pung Kok Yuen to see the free school organized by the Hong Kong Buddhist Association. Chairman Lo inquired about and comforted the innocent and lively pupils with great care, which moved these children to tears.

At 9:00 PM, all circles in Hong Kong and Kowloon held a grand welcome meeting at the Entertainment Theatre, with over a thousand participants. This was truly an unprecedented grand gathering in the hundred years since Hong Kong was opened as a port. The atmosphere was extremely warm and tense, fully expressing the overseas Chinese's love and respect for Chairman Lo. Chairman Lo was in full military uniform that day, his chest adorned with shining medals. He was tall and imposing. When he walked into the venue as music played, the overseas Chinese were overjoyed to see him. After Chairman Chen Su delivered the opening speech and Chamber of Commerce Chairman Dong Zhongwei delivered the welcome speech, Chairman Lo gave instructions, and the entire atmosphere became even more solemn and tense. Chairman Lo first conveyed his greetings to the overseas Chinese and then encouraged them to "cooperate and unite to make Guangdong more prosperous and build a new China and a new Guangdong based on the Three Principles of the People..." Chairman Lo's earnest instructions gave the overseas Chinese infinite warmth and comfort.

Visiting British Warships

After the meeting, Chairman Lo, at the invitation of the British naval authorities, visited their naval cruiser "Bermuda", aircraft carrier "Venerable", and submarine "Tacidon". Chairman Lo's actions during the expedition to Burma were well known throughout the world. Therefore, the British naval officers and soldiers on the ships were very excited to have the opportunity to see this intelligent and capable Chinese general, and they all felt honored. Their diligent hospitality and grand welcome also deeply thanked Chairman Lo! At noon, Chairman Lo was hosted by Major General Fitzwilliam for lunch at the British Army Commander's residence.

At 3:00 PM, Chairman Lo also went to the welcome meeting of the Chongzheng General Association, an organization of overseas Chinese from Hakka descent, where he was presented with a brocade embroidered with the words "Thousands of Cities for the Party and Nation." Then he attended the welcome meeting of the Chaozhou Chamber of Commerce.

As night fell and the lights began to shine, Chairman Lo went to the Jianguo Restaurant to attend the Hong Kong and Kowloon community's banquet, which can be regarded as the most recordable page of Chairman Lo's visit to Hong Kong, and it can also be said that the rhythm of this itinerary reached its climax. The overseas Chinese regarded Chairman Lo as sacred, and they were as respectful and respectful to him as they were to a family head, as if Chairman Lo had brought them spring. Every overseas Chinese face was filled with proud smiles. After three rounds of drinks, overseas Chinese leader Dong Zhongwei gave a speech, praising Chairman Lo to the extreme. He said: "Chairman Lo is both literary and martial, intelligent and brave, and has repeatedly achieved extraordinary feats in the Battle of Burma. His prestige is well-known. Now he has come to preside over the government of Guangdong, governing the people with the good methods of managing the army, and managing politics with the extraordinary strategies of warfare. Although military and civilian affairs are different, the principles of governing are the same. As Ouyang Wen-Zhong Gong said, 'Going out as a general and entering as a prime minister, working diligently for the royal family, being steadfast in times of danger, and placing the country in a state of stability,' Chairman Lo is truly worthy of this honor..."

Concern for Overseas Chinese Affairs

Chairman Lo stood up in thunderous applause and gave a sincere speech. In addition to repeatedly thanking the overseas Chinese for their deep affection, he also elaborated on his policy guidelines for Guangdong, saying: "Developing overseas Chinese affairs and strengthening the power of overseas Chinese, making them a vital force in our construction, is one of the five major guidelines for building a new Guangdong based on the Three Principles of the People." He also said: "Hong Kong is the general station for developing Nanyang commerce. Overseas Chinese in Hong Kong extending their commerce to Nanyang is certainly not aggression, but only natural development, because the overseas Chinese in Nanyang are our brothers... Overseas Chinese lay a great economic foundation in a peaceful manner, based on natural development, which is a great contribution to the motherland... Regarding protecting the people's businesses, not only does Guangdong Province's policy direction have such a decision, but Chairman Chiang has already declared on economic policy that he encourages the people to operate and develop the people's livelihood economy, implementing wealth for the people. Overseas Chinese occupy a superior position in the development of commerce, especially the compatriots in Hong Kong and Kowloon. The Guangdong Provincial Government, adhering to the central government's policies, grants the convenience of free operation to the people in all industrial and commercial businesses except those that are publicly operated, and at the same time decides to provide guarantees. I hope that the overseas Chinese leaders in Hong Kong and Kowloon will make various industrial and commercial developments for the welfare of the people and the country, cooperate with the national policies, and strive for the work of strengthening the country." Afterwards, Chairman Lo introduced the two committee members, Huang Wenshan and Xiao Ciwo, to the overseas Chinese leaders, because Committee Member Huang plans to stay in Hong Kong for a while to listen to the opinions of the overseas Chinese leaders on cultural and educational undertakings. Committee Member Xiao's task in staying in Hong Kong is to investigate transportation and food issues. Finally, Chairman Lo led everyone to raise their glasses and remotely wish Chairman Chiang good health. The grand gathering ended in a pleasant and festive atmosphere. When Chairman Lo boarded his car in front of the Jianguo Restaurant, the crowd had already gathered around, as they rarely had the opportunity to see Chairman Lo's elegant demeanor.

Farewell in Hong Kong

This highest administrator of Guangdong Province, due to his heavy official duties, could not delay any longer. On the morning of the 12th, Chairman Lo bid farewell to the hundreds of thousands of overseas Chinese in Hong Kong and Kowloon! The Tsim Sha Tsui station was as crowded as the day before. Governor Harcourt also went to the station with senior officials to see him off. Governor Harcourt also decided to lead senior officials of the Hong Kong government to Guangdong on the 17th of this month to return the visit. At 9:10 AM, the train whistled mercilessly. Chairman Lo and his party had no choice but to bid farewell to the people who came to see them off one by one. The overseas Chinese leaders and a group of male and female members of the Youth Corps were even more reluctant to part, as if Chairman Lo had taken their hearts away. The train slowly left the platform, but they were still standing there in a daze.

Although it was only a short two days, it made us deeply feel that after the victory, our international status has obviously improved, and the Allied countries have a different view of our country. At the same time, the enthusiastic emotions of the overseas Chinese over the past two days and their respect for the leaders of the motherland all the more show how eager they are for the success of the motherland's construction. Chairman Lo said it well. He said: "The harmonious atmosphere between the Chinese and British personnel in the past two days is enough to foreshadow the brilliant future of cooperation between the two sides. At the same time, in the loving atmosphere of the overseas Chinese, one can also foresee the great and bright future of China." These two sentences are a good ending to this article. (December 34, in Guangzhou)

Shanghai is still a metropolis where East and West meet, engage in lofty discussions, and the sound of money clangs like thunder. Outwardly, there are few changes. You can still see the stark contrast between local houses and modern high-rise buildings. The streets are full of people. The traffic is like a surging, endless tide. There are pedestrians resigned to their fate, reckless bicycles, orderly rickshaws, and fast-moving tricycles, an incredible and surprisingly efficient combination of rickshaws and tricycles as a mode of transportation.

Underlying Situation in Flux

In terms of content, however, Shanghai is completely different. Currently, the most pressing thing is that things are almost all in flux. The most significant change is the emergence of the municipal government. The foreign powers no longer wield their authority. The British-style Municipal Council is no longer visible. The mayor is the composed, round-faced Qian Dajun, who has a long history of following Chairman Chiang. You can still see red-turbaned Indian policemen with bushy beards directing traffic, but they will soon be replaced. American military police and naval police are everywhere, but they are concentrated in areas where Americans live or visit.

Without Wall Street, No Major Trade

Shanghai is still the largest and most Westernized city in China. But it has been isolated for many years. Shanghai's frenzied transactions are all petty commodities—like retailers in New York, without the frenzy of wholesalers and manufacturers.

"Old Shanghai" laments to you: Compared to the prosperous days of the past, how miserable it is now! But American soldiers in this opulent city on the Pacific side are in a "carefree" place.

There are about seven thousand American sailors here, and about six thousand soldiers. The number of air force personnel is uncertain and cannot be accurately counted. There is beer, Scotch, vodka (Russian wine), steak, and pastries in restaurants and taverns. Its exquisite Chinese food. After getting used to military rations that only have nutritional value but no taste, tasting these things is indeed top-notch.

Tavern Life Thriving Day by Day

Taverns and nightclubs are thriving day by day. There is one called "Atomic Coffee Shop." Another is called "Jeep Nightclub." In addition, there is one that will be opening soon. There is a nightclub called Ivan Tai, which can be said to be quite elegant and refined.

The best place is Montland, with only forty-two seats, where drinks cost $3.50 to $4.50 USD.

Food is all expensive, and housing is extremely scarce. 200,000 Jewish refugees in Shanghai still live in the Hongkou district, and a small number of people have to live in refugee shelters. Among all the people in Shanghai, the Jews feel the most uncertain about the future. They dream of America, just as loyal Chinese dream of paradise.

Lost Counterfeit Money, Lost Life

Money is the most awkward problem for Shanghainese. You have to carry large bags of counterfeit money, and even children and beggars have a handful of counterfeit money. Newspapers say that an elderly clerk forgot his 40 million yuan of counterfeit money on a rickshaw and died of fright. I calculated that this sum is only equivalent to 133 US dollars. This cannot help but make me feel sad.

The Sardine Incident, Thought-Provoking

Inflation is a fatal obstacle to trade. There is a strange thing in Shanghai: a box of sardines is sold and bought, passing through twenty people, so everyone profits.

Later, a clever man opened a can, and then opened a few more, and saw that they were all spoiled. After being deceived, he called the last seller and scolded him severely.

The seller shouted: "Did you open them? Good heavens! These sardines are not for eating, but for buying and selling!"

Silent and Unnoticed, Causing Trouble

Shanghai is not American Wall Street, and the authorities do not need to take strict precautions. The councilors of the municipal government are busy with hot cups and dishes, and are working hard to promote municipal affairs. Of course, Chinese people need comfort in their work.

There is also an interesting group of people in Shanghai, that is, the defeated Japanese, who silently want to live a Shanghai life that dares not cause trouble.

However, despite many troubles, Shanghainese still hold an optimistic atmosphere like gamblers, believing that one day they will get a flush and make a fortune. An American businessman nagged me for half an hour. I asked him: Does Shanghai, this metropolis, have a future after all? He leaned down, held my shoulder, and said in a low voice: "Good friend! Shanghai should exist for the prosperity of history!" (Written by John Howard of *Time* Weekly, translated by the editorial department of this newspaper)

Commentary

### The Problem of China's "Opposition Party"

— Li Naian

I.

Some say that the Chinese Kuomintang is the ruling party, and the current Communist Party is the opposition party. This statement seems to reflect that China has become democratic on the one hand, and on the other hand, it admits that all actions of the Communist Party are qualified as an opposition party. However, does China's current opposition party really possess the conditions of an opposition party in a democratic country? This is a question worth exploring.

Therefore, I must first declare that I am a person without any party affiliation, and I do not oppose the existence of an opposition party in China. It is not because I am a person who loves democracy and hopes that the opposition party can grow and develop its greater cause from the path of formal political struggle. The problem we are now discussing and studying is: What path should the opposition party follow, and how can it truly be called an "opposition party"?

The fact is very obvious. As the name suggests, the opposition party stands in opposition to the ruling party, and under the conditions that do not violate the survival interests of the country and the nation, it criticizes the current government's political programs and policies with a fair attitude, so that the country embarks on a more correct and happier path. At the same time, it can publicize its own propositions and win the support of the people to develop its strength. There are good examples of this in multi-party countries in Europe and the United States. The collapse of the Chamberlain cabinet's policy of appeasement towards Germany in Britain and the further advancement of Churchill's advocacy of war, and the United States' abandonment of neutrality and self-production of munitions in 1940, all prove the good harvest of the existence of an opposition party. Naturally, without objective and rigorous criticism of everything, there will be no vigilance on the part of the subject, and political struggle is no exception. In the political evolution history of democratic countries, we certainly cannot deny the merits of the opposition party. However, are the opposition's means of opposition aimed at the shortcomings of each political program or policy, and are they suitable for the situation of the country and the nation? This is worth thinking about and exploring. In order to have a factual comparison, we confirm that the opposition parties in European and American democratic countries only express their opposition political views through debates in Congress and forums in newspapers. Then, let us shift our gaze to China to see: Does China really have an opposition party?

II.

There is no need to hide the fact that the Chinese Kuomintang is now the ruling party in China. And even if, as some people say, the Communist Party is the current opposition party in China, then we must ask what major things this opposition party has done.

From the Northern Expedition to the present, in the past twenty years, the political programs and policies adopted by the Chinese Kuomintang, we do not need to be taboo, it itself may have considerable errors and shortcomings, which is just like the head of a large family, because the family under its management has repeatedly encountered losses and disasters, and is working hard on the reorganization work after the destruction, naturally there will be many places where it cannot take care of everything, this is a fact. The opposition party stands in its proper position, and of course we cannot demand that it completely forgive certain shortcomings of the ruling party. On the contrary, we hope that it can truly represent the people and point out the shortcomings and remedies at any time, so that the ruling party itself has the opportunity to improve.

For example, the Communist Party says every day that the Kuomintang's policies are wrong, or even that this person is corrupt and that person is engaging in malfeasance. Then, where are the reasons why the policies are wrong, and what methods should be adopted to correct them? What is the fact of corruption? What is the evidence of malfeasance? As long as there are facts, investigations, reasonable propositions, and conclusive arguments, even if the Kuomintang does not pay attention, the people will definitely pay attention. However, the people cannot tolerate the opposition party only engaging in malicious attacks, or even attempting internal chaos. Who does not want to see politics get on the right track immediately? The Communist Party members have mouths, and there are also organizational newspapers, which can be publicly discussed, allowing the people to consider and criticize, and allowing the government to adopt and improve, this is the reasonable means of opposition. I believe that the ruling Kuomintang will not restrict the Communist Party's right to speak in the trend of democracy. Because the government has already recognized the existence of the Communist Party, the Communist Party has its own political status, and representatives of the Communist Party participate in the National Political Council and the upcoming Political Consultative Conference. This clearly proves that the Kuomintang does not adopt an attitude of absolutely not accepting criticism. In any case, the Kuomintang is by no means intentionally condoning corrupt villains. We take the facts since the War of Resistance as proof. The Kuomintang is working hard to punish corruption and clean up officialdom, and the Kuomintang is diligently seeking the people's livelihood and revising its policies at any time to adapt to the needs of the times. This is obvious to all.

With China's vast territory, its large population, its different temperatures, and its different human natures, the father of Wang Zhaoming would never have taught his son to be a traitor when he grew up; I believe that Mr. Mao Zedong's father did not expect that Mr. Mao would be a Communist for the rest of his life. From these facts, we have to think calmly, even if there are bad elements in the Kuomintang, what about the Communist Party itself? Are they all sages? Ask each other's conscience, rely on the principles of nature, and let the people speak freely. How much better is Yan'an, which was ruled by Mr. Mao for eight years, than Chongqing? Is there corruption? Is there robbery? Are taxes what the people are willing to pay? Are the people all allowed to speak freely? This requires Mr. Mao's generation to investigate themselves. Can the Communist Party's books be taken on the streets in Chongqing? Can the New China Daily appear as the Communist Party's organizational newspaper and attack the National Government, but in Yan'an, there is no publication of the Central Daily or other private newspapers or books. Why can't a government that shouts democracy in the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region tolerate other parties? Who killed more than a thousand people such as Ju Chao and Gui? Who is exploiting the people with all kinds of donations? The Communist Party stands in the position of the opposition party to the Central Government. Why does it not allow its own opposition party to exist in the areas it occupies? It cannot take care of itself, but specializes in attacking political enemies. Can such a political struggle win the trust of the people?

III.

Secondly, let us discuss the issue of political struggle. The word "political struggle" clearly means political struggle, not the territorial war of the warlord era and the autocratic era. Even a young student can understand this problem. The main condition of political struggle is to influence or move the masses with the party's theories and facts, so that the masses believe in the party's propositions. Especially the opposition party in the opposition should show that its propositions are reasonable and correct everywhere, and at the same time try to prove the future policies with facts. Only in this way can there be a real opposition force. In the United States, how intense is the political debate between parties during each election period, but they have never raised the party's status above the interests of the country and the nation, nor have they used the army as a tool for political struggle. Why? Because all political struggles are not allowed to violate the survival interests of the country; and the army belongs to the country, and no political party is allowed to regard the army as private like a warlord. If this principle is violated, the political struggle will definitely turn into a military struggle, and the central government that implements the national orders will only have to bear the responsibility of suppressing internal chaos. Just read the history of the American Civil War and the biography of President Lincoln, and you can think about it more than half.

What about China? Let us say with conscience that even if the policies of the Chinese Kuomintang are wrong, or even bad, but at least it has overthrown the Manchu Qing, overthrown the warlords, resisted the violent enemy, recovered the lost land, abolished the unequal treaties, and raised China's international status. These are all iron facts. Is it a dictatorship to the end? The Kuomintang has not restricted the legal activities of all parties, and it has not allowed the existence of dissident parties like the totalitarianism worshiped by the Communist Party. And what about the Communist Party itself? After working hard for twenty years, what is the benefit to the country and the nation? How much loss did the country suffer from the ten years of harassment before the War of Resistance? Ruijin in Jiangxi is still a piece of ashes, and the people will always remember it. Even from the "25,000-mile Long March" history boasted by the Communist Party itself, the people still have lingering pain in the places where the wandering passed. The Communist Party also said, "Mr. Sun Yat-sen's Three Principles of the People are necessary for China today, and our party is willing to strive for its realization." But after saying this in September 1937, the Communist Party's establishment was the so-called "Anti-Japanese Government" in the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region. As a result, one point was for anti-Japanese, two points were to deal with the Kuomintang, and seven points were to strengthen its own strength. Therefore, it expanded its army, occupied territory, and did anti-unification movements every day. And what did the Communist Party do after the victory of the War of Resistance? Attacking cities, seizing land, destroying transportation, robbing the people, inciting riots, and creating social unrest, are these all considered "political struggle" methods of parties in democratic countries? There are many multi-party countries in the world, and there is more than just the Chinese Communist Party fighting for power, but why is there no other example? Roosevelt was Wilkie's political enemy. How fiercely they fought in the election struggle, but Wilkie lost the election. With Wilkie's power, why didn't he come to a destruction and chaos with President Roosevelt's Democratic Party like the Chinese Communist Party? Churchill made great achievements and succeeded, but when he failed in the election, he quietly let Attlee's Labour Party come to power, and he did not occupy territory with troops, and the British Labour Party did not come to a riot and destruction when it competed for the election!

As mentioned above, political struggle is not a warlord's territorial war. No matter what, both sides of the political struggle should take the interests of the country as their interests. The Communist Party cannot put forward correct political theories to make people believe, and it admits that China should implement the Three Principles of the People today and cannot implement communism, but it insists on using military actions to fight for territory and power, which simply loses the qualifications of a democratic party to engage in political struggle. No one can see any difference from the warlords of the past!

IV.

The opposition party is the lighting lamp of democratic politics, and it should have the style of a lighting lamp. Since the Chinese Kuomintang has not opposed the existence of the Communist Party, the Communist Party can develop its own opinions, political views and its future. Although the opposition party and the ruling party may have different places, but now that the Communist Party claims to be standing in the position of the opposition party, it should correct its own shortcomings, value the lives of the people more, and value the dignity and rights of the country more. Immediately abandon the policy of riots, attacking cities and occupying territory, change the suicidal policy of destroying transportation and damaging industry and mining, stop attacking the national army, and abolish the political power outside the legal government. First, obey the national decrees and military orders, and strive to express the party's propositions with facts, and then it can win the belief of the people. The main goal of political parties is nothing more than to demand political progress for the country and the nation, so that the people can live a good life. Then, we should see the current situation of the country today, and not harm the poor family who has fought hard for eight years, and then suffer from internal chaos. We believe that democratic politics is to move forward step by step. Relying solely on fighting with guns, fighting for land and shedding blood, and dividing the country will not produce democracy! If the Communist Party is truly fond of democracy, I think they should first ask the Chinese people: How many people are willing to hand China over to the Communist Party to be a communist experiment?

China has now set off a fervent trend of democratic thought. We believe that the Chinese Kuomintang is also working hard on democratic political construction. Naturally, we also hope that there will be an ideal opposition party. However, the opposition party that we seek must take the interests of the country and the nation as the premise in the way it engages in political struggle. In order to make political progress, we hope that this opposition party will fight more fiercely and more practically, without rioting and obeying national decrees and military orders, so that China's politics can become clearer and more progressive. Can today's Chinese Communist Party meet this condition? This depends on the Chinese Communist Party to take good care of itself! (34th year, December, 11th, Longtan)

### Hong Kong Lifeblood

Before the war, Hong Kong's external transportation was extremely convenient. British, American, Japanese and other shipping companies have regular cargo and passenger ships sailing to Europe. In the Pacific, Hong Kong has American, Canadian, Japanese and other routes. Hong Kong also has transportation relations with Africa, Australia and South America. In the nearby ocean, Hong Kong and India, Java, Taiwan, Vietnam, Japan and various ports along the coast of China have regular maritime traffic.

Hong Kong has become a major shipping center, which can be seen from the fact that in 1937, a total of 33,782 ocean and inland river ships (36 million tons) entered and exited Hong Kong. This figure is even larger than the number of ships entering and exiting Shanghai in 1933 and 1934, and perhaps even larger than Kobe, the main port in Japan. British ships accounted for slightly less than half of the ocean ships entering Hong Kong.

According to statistics, ocean-going ships accounted for two-thirds of the tonnage of ships entering Hong Kong, and the rest were mostly inland river ships. Although there are many sailboats, they only account for a small part of the tonnage.

Hong Kong Harbor, located between the island and the mainland, forms a natural anchorage for ships. The docks and other anchorage facilities on the mainland can only accommodate twelve ships longer than seven hundred feet. Hong Kong has harbor facilities for various shipping needs, and its convenience is the same as other modern ports in the world. In 1937, there were three warehouse companies in Hong Kong with a total capacity of 500,000 tons of cargo. In addition, there are many private warehouses in Hong Kong and Kowloon. Hong Kong has no shortage of facilities for storing various goods. The two major shipyards have dry docks that can accommodate ships longer than 787 feet; in addition, there are five slipways that can accommodate ships waiting for repair (longer than 390 feet and weighing 4,000 tons). Other smaller shipyards can also repair ships with lighter tonnage. (Translated from Foreign Trade Weekly)

### Finance: Business - Weekly Review

— Chong Bo

Generally More Gains Than Losses

Finance: Last week in the local financial market, the interbank interest rate for silver was stable at three-tenths of a cent. The unofficial rate fluctuated between eight and ten percent. However, due to the rise in domestic and foreign stocks, as well as gold and US dollars, the foundation gradually solidified. Next week marks the end of the Gregorian calendar year, and silver will undoubtedly become tighter. Speculation initially suggested that the US dollar exchange rate would rise to 760,000 yuan. Subsequently, due to a large volume of exports and a sharp drop in the Hong Kong dollar, selling pressure increased, reaching a low of 700,000 yuan. Finally, with easing silver supply and rising domestic and foreign stocks, buying interest revived, rising to 752,000 yuan at closing, an increase of 22,000 yuan from the previous week. Market insiders believe that after the US dollar is fixed, gold will also remain stable at a certain level, similar to the situation before when gold prices stabilized at around 1,100 yuan in the 25th and 26th years. Therefore, they boldly began afternoon forward trading. However, cautious gold merchants are still observing, so afternoon trading is light. Gold jewelry was listed at 2,000 yuan higher per tael, while standard silver remained stable at 600 yuan. Silver coins were 450 yuan each, the same as the previous week. Due to the gradual increase in import and export trade, the demand and supply of US dollars were balanced, fluctuating between 1,170 yuan and 1,280 yuan, finally standing firm at 1,255 yuan, an increase of 35 yuan from the previous week. Hong Kong dollars were stable. There was talk that new Hong Kong dollars were valued at 30%. On Wednesday, sellers emerged, causing the price to plummet from 65 yuan to 45 yuan. Gradually, people in the shipping industry and British merchants from Guangzhou took advantage of the dip to buy, rising back to 50 or 60 yuan at closing, still a decrease of 9 yuan from the previous week.

Securities: Due to optimism about the current situation, the banking sector purchased unified government bonds. Bulls seized the opportunity to squeeze the market and spread news of repayment of Sun Yat-sen bonds and victory subsidies. As a result, Class C bonds reached a peak of 850 yuan, exceeding the face value of 750 yuan by a significant margin. This prompted bulls in the securities industry to take profits and sell, retreating to 700 yuan at closing, still an increase of 100 yuan from the previous week. Due to abundant idle funds and minimal fluctuations in the US dollar, there was no room for movement. Funds flowed into the stock market, with silver firms and bull companies buying. In addition, industry leaders requested the opening of domestic stock trading to revitalize domestic industry, resulting in a surge in buying interest. Major and minor popular stocks rose by 40% to 50%. The stock of Wing On Textile Factory, led by industry leaders, rose sharply due to the active yarn market. Buying interest concentrated, and the stock closed at a new high price of 710 yuan, a significant increase of 225 yuan from the previous week. Foreign stocks rose due to the resumption of operations at foreign factories and purchases by Jewish merchants. Jardine Matheson rose by more than 50%, and Ewo Cotton Mill rose by 40%. Next week is the end of the Gregorian calendar year, and both domestic and foreign stocks are expected to close at new high prices.

Goods: Regarding commodities, the supply of rice was slightly scarce due to the purchase of military rations and restrictions on external transportation in rice-producing areas such as Changshu and Wuxi. In addition, local residents and food vendors purchased more, resulting in an increase of 500 to 1,000 yuan per shi (unit of measurement). Japonica rice stood at 7,000 to 8,000 yuan, while indica rice stood at 6,500 to 7,800 yuan. There were rumors that a French foreign firm had ordered Vietnamese rice at only 4,000 yuan per shi, suitable for the Shanghai market. The situation where Shanghai relied on indica rice to maintain its economy will reappear. The price of flour increased due to rising wheat prices and the implementation of unified wheat flour tax, which increased manufacturers' costs. Buyers were active, and merchants from both the north and south rushed to purchase. Although the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) sold 10,000 bags of charitable, affordable American flour at only 1,900 yuan per bag, the market price of Chinese No. 1 flour still rose to 3,000 yuan, a significant increase of 750 yuan from the previous week, accounting for one-quarter of the total price. Next week, the city will have the second phase of affordable flour retail. At the same time, American wheat continues to be imported. With the world no longer at war, it is believed that flour prices will not rise indefinitely. The price of miscellaneous grains increased due to the impact of land and water transportation costs. Generally, soybeans rose by 400 to 500 yuan, peanuts rose by 3,000 to 4,000 yuan, and corn rose by 300 yuan. Edible oil prices rose and fell in line with raw materials such as soybeans and peanuts, with each hundred catties increasing by 2,000 yuan. Soybean oil was slightly more expensive than raw oil, by about 10%. The reason is that raw oil freezes and does not look good. Due to the city's sale of affordable Taiwan white sugar at 360 yuan per catty, there were few buyers for red and white sugar on the market, and each dan (unit of measurement) fell by 3,000 to 4,000 yuan. In textiles, merchants from Sichuan and Hankou actively purchased cotton yarn and cotton cloth. The former focused on 20-count and 16-count yarn, which increased by 60,000 to 70,000 yuan. The latter exclusively favored 12-pound "Dragon Head" white sheeting, which suddenly increased by 5,000 yuan per bolt. Cotton was sought after by factories and cotton firms. Tongzhou fine velvet rose from 40,000 to 60,000 yuan, and "Fire Machine" cotton also rose to 40,000 yuan, an increase of 10,000 to 20,000 yuan from the previous week. If compared to 20-count "Double Horse" yarn at 640,000 yuan, it is still equivalent to 11 dan of cotton for one bale of yarn. Due to exports to the United States, the silk market saw a price hike in high-grade white silk fabrics of 90,000 yuan. Tussah silk remained stable. The demand for rayon increased due to the resolution of the labor dispute at the silk factory. 120-count "Sky Bridge" rayon rose by 80,000 yuan per case, to 530,000 yuan. Satin and American-Chinese bedspreads were the most popular, rising by 45,000 yuan per hundred pieces, while the rest remained flat. Although there were inquiries from European and American exporters about tea, market prices were not very stimulating. Only mid-range black tea rose by 1,500 yuan, while the rest softened slightly. Affected by the cold weather, there were more buyers for fuel. Yangquan white briquettes rose by 60,000 yuan, returning to 300,000 yuan per ton. Other small pieces, dust, and shavings rose by 5,000 to 10,000 yuan. Coal balls were stable. Firewood sales were sluggish due to rain and snow. Chestnut firewood reached a new low price of 1,200 yuan, and pine firewood was only 900 yuan per dan. Among daily necessities, candles rose by 3,500 yuan per case due to purchases by Sichuan merchants. Matches and soap also rose by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan each. Due to the price increases by Wing Tai Ho and British American Tobacco, as well as the need for year-end gifts, "Old Knife," "Fairy," and "British American" cigarettes rose by 70,000 to 175,000 yuan, especially "Old Knife." In addition, paper, Western medicine, and industrial raw materials each saw a 10% price increase. Cosmetics were uniquely flat.

### Economic Briefs

The Transportation Department of the China Central Railway Administration has formulated provisional measures for the registration of direct merchants and transshipment companies in order to facilitate freight transportation. All local direct merchants and transshipment companies that have obtained registration certificates from legal authorities can obtain the provisional registration measures from the department in the North Station Building starting immediately. Registration will begin on January 5, 1946.

The Fuel Committee has approved the request of local coal ball manufacturers to supply coal dust, which is sufficient to meet the city's needs. The selling price is also lower than the market price. The allocation for each member is based on their electricity bill.

The local Silver Industry Consumer Cooperative is organized by people in the silver industry, and the person in charge is Pan Yangyao, etc. Recently, it held a fair-price distribution of 克寗 (克寧, Kening) milk powder, scheduled for three days, from the 23rd to the 25th of this month. Those who need it can register in advance. Many factories in Sichuan Province have applied to the Ministry of Economic Affairs for closure. Those that have been approved include China Industrial Development Corporation, Yuxin Iron and Steel Plant, and 14 others. The remaining applications are still under review. Hua'an and Huigong factories have laid off their workers. Whether these closed factories will resume operations or be reorganized in the future will depend on future economic conditions.

### The Legal Status of Capital

— Pan Shihao

Capital is the only prerequisite for industrial and commercial enterprises. Profit-making businesses must have initial capital investment in order to operate and generate profits. The amount must be calculated in monetary terms and must have a definite amount recorded in the accounts. Therefore, whether the organization is a partnership or a company, except for sole proprietorships, which only require individuals to consider their own financial resources and use them freely, the amount of capital should be specified in the contract or articles of association as the basis for determining the content of the joint contract. Externally, regardless of the organization, there must be a definite amount of capital. Registration with the competent authority is required before it can defend against third parties. The same applies to capital increases or decreases. This is evident in the Commercial Registration Law, the Company Law, the Business Tax Law, and the Income Tax Law.

The Income Tax Law, in Article 8 of the Implementing Rules, provides a more detailed regulation: "The term 'capital' in this law refers to the paid-up share capital of a company or the actual capital invested by other organizations." It also states that "The capital in the preceding paragraph does not include investment in credit or labor." Article 44 states, "The capital of profit-making enterprises in categories A and B of the first class shall be applied for investigation, approval, and registration with the local competent tax collection authority within fifteen days after the start of business. When there is an increase or decrease in capital, an application shall be made within fifteen days from the date of the increase or decrease." It is very clear that capital is the actual invested capital that can be counted in monetary terms, and that it can only defend against third parties after registration. In the Civil Law and the Company Law, unlimited liability shareholders are not prohibited from investing labor and credit, and it is stipulated that they must be calculated as a monetary value and used as capital. This is tantamount to replacing the money that shareholders should invest with other properties of equal value.

The Company Law and the Income Tax Law strictly regulate the valuation standards for capital investment that is replaced by property other than money. After the valuation of shares, shareholders cannot demand the return of this original property in the future, and the operator cannot force the return of this original property to the original shareholders. The property of the enterprise is jointly owned. Once it becomes capital, it is merged with other properties to form the total capital. It is impossible to point out that a certain part is the investment used by a certain shareholder, and blame only this certain shareholder. Today's discussion of reorganizing the book value of capital focuses on the separate calculation of new and old shareholders. The intention is that the investment in legal tender was valuable at the beginning, while the investment in puppet Central Reserve Bank notes was not valuable. Therefore, it is argued that the puppet currency investment portion should be discounted more heavily. Some even argue that it should be converted into capital at a discount of 200 to 1, according to the central government's method of redeeming puppet currency circulating in the market. However, it is not known that except for a few special companies and firms, when puppet currency new capital was collected in addition to the legal tender old capital, the puppet currency was not as worthless as it is now. The puppet currency received has long been combined into the total amount of capital and transformed into other properties. How can it be compared to the current purchasing power of the puppet currency? If we do not recognize the puppet currency as legal tender, its nature is similar to investment in property other than money when it was initially received as shares. The law does not allow operators to forcibly return the original property to the original shareholders at the time of the shareholders' investment.

As for the establishment of the amount of capital, it must be registered with the competent authority before it can defend against third parties. This is entirely for the purpose of obtaining an external position in law. Internally, whether it is a partnership or a company, once a resolution is made in accordance with the law, a partnership agreement is signed, shareholder meeting minutes are recorded, and a share subscription is filled out and the share payment is paid, the contractual act has been established. Even if there is negligence in registration, it will only be subject to fines, and even imprisonment for the actor. It does not broadly abandon the establishment of the shareholder's investment relationship in the partnership or company. The same applies when there is an increase in capital and the registration procedures have not been completed. Before the recovery of the occupied areas, there were many cases where the establishment and change of registration could not be applied for. This is an irresistible force in the environment, and it cannot erase the fact that the internal contract between the partnership and the company and the shareholders will not be shaken. Today's discussion of reorganizing the book value of capital advocates respecting the law, which is the spirit of the rule of law and deserves to be supported. However, it should also be known that the "internal contractual" act should be protected by law. If there are illegal acts in the process of capital increase or decrease, it is another problem, and legal remedies can be sought separately. It cannot be used to erase the general facts.

Some say that for income tax purposes, the book value of capital should be reorganized to a larger amount this year in order to reduce the tax rate. However, this is not the case. According to the Income Tax Law listed above, the increase in capital must take effect after registration. According to the provisions of Articles 37 to 39 of the Implementing Rules, the amount of capital must be calculated on an annual average based on the amount already declared. If it is only raised at the end of the year, it cannot reduce the total tax rate according to the law.

### Landowners in Various Districts of the City Should Register Quickly Mayor Qian's Written Statement Yesterday

In order to supervise and promote land administration work and to ensure that citizens have a thorough understanding of land registration laws, regulations, procedures, and other issues, Mayor Qian of this city issued the following written statement:

All Procedures Are Simple, Easy, and Fast

"Land registration is prescribed by law and is intended to protect the rights and interests of the people. During the war of resistance in Shanghai, there were many land disputes. Therefore, conducting registration is an important task for resolving disputes. For those who have obtained business licenses before the war in the six districts of Huangpu, Zhabei, Yinxiang, Hunan, Caojing, and Fahua, they can directly apply for the replacement of land ownership certificates. The procedures are simple, easy, and fast. Those who have not registered must register uniformly. The Land Administration Bureau stipulates that the registration receipt period is from November 19th of this year to January 18th of the 35th year of the Republic of China [1946]. If owners have special circumstances within the stipulated period and cannot apply for registration on time, they can state the reasons and obtain a one-month extension to complete the registration.

Registration Is Also Possible During the Public Notice Period

For land that has already been registered by the owner, after the Land Administration Bureau reviews it and finds no disputes, it will post a public notice for two months. After the public notice period expires, if there are no objections to the property rights, a land ownership certificate will be issued. Therefore, the fastest land registration process takes more than two to three months. At the time of registration, the Land Administration Bureau will issue a receipt. However, some citizens may think that the two-month receipt period is too short. It should be known that after the stipulated period expires, land that has not been registered must go through a public notice procedure. During this public notice period, it is also possible to apply for registration retroactively. If the public notice period is exceeded and there are no legitimate reasons stated, and registration is not applied for, the government will take over the management on behalf of the owner. During the period of government management, registration of property rights can still be made within two years after the end of the war of resistance. Therefore, government management according to law is not a confiscation of the people's property. This is a procedure of registration technique, so I hope citizens will register quickly.

Fees Are Collected According to Regulations

Regarding the collection of land registration fees, everything is handled in accordance with the regulations of the central government. For those who apply for the first land ownership registration, the registration fee is charged at four per thousand of the declared land price. For those who apply for registration of land rights acquisition, establishment, transfer, change, or termination, it is uniformly charged at two per thousand of the value of the rights. In the future, when issuing land ownership certificates and land other rights certificates, each certificate will be calculated from one hundred to ten thousand yuan based on the property value. Stamp duty is collected at 6% to 15% of the contract price in accordance with the central government regulations. This is a central government tax, and the municipal government is only temporarily handling it on behalf of the central government.

As for the key personnel responsible for land administration, they are all experts transferred from the Central Land Administration Department and land administration agencies in various provinces and cities. Other staff members are also familiar with land administration matters and all have the service spirit of integrity, efficiency, and amiability, and will be able to complete this task."

[Another News] Mayor Qian Dajun went to Nanjing a few days ago to report to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek. He has completed his official duties and returned to Shanghai at 4:00 PM yesterday.

### Shanghai Representatives to the National Assembly Have No Plans to Go to Chongqing

### Workers of the British Tramway Company Once Went on Strike Yesterday Morning Drivers and Ticket Sellers Demand Wage Adjustment

(Our Newspaper) The British Tramway Company suddenly experienced a strike at 6:45 AM yesterday. All trams that had already left the factory returned to the factory and stopped running. After learning about this, the Social Affairs Bureau immediately sent Zhu Chenghao to mediate. The Third Front Army also sent personnel to persuade the workers, and the entire workforce resumed work at 9:30 AM. Labor and management are being mediated by the Social Affairs Bureau.

The Labor Unrest Has Been Brewing for a Long Time

According to reporters' investigations, the labor unrest has been brewing for a long time. Since the company was taken over by British businessman Aibelock, it has been experiencing financial difficulties. As a result, for the three months of September, October, and November, the salaries of all employees, more than three thousand people, have been delayed. Each person has only borrowed about 30,000 yuan. The employees have long been dissatisfied and have repeatedly sent representatives to negotiate with the management, demanding the payment of the arrears for the past three months. It is said that over one thousand workers in the Transportation Department and the Mechanical Affairs Department gathered about 400 people on Pei'er Road at 11:00 AM on the 21st. Due to a misunderstanding, they beat Tang Yifang, the ticket-selling representative number 432, and injured him. Also, at about 1:30 PM on the 22nd, the coppersmiths in the Mechanical Affairs Department had disagreements over wage issues and a fight broke out. As a result, one coppersmith died from his injuries.

Unequal Treatment Demands Adjustment

The company authorities, fearing the expansion of the situation, tried to borrow 150 million yuan from the Central Bank and paid the back wages the day before yesterday. However, the track layers, drivers, and ticket sellers, more than one thousand workers in the Transportation Department, believed that their wages were lower than those of other departments and that the company authorities treated employees unfairly. They demanded an adjustment and staged a strike yesterday morning. Director Zhao Zengjue of the Public Utilities Bureau and Zhu Chenghao of the Social Affairs Bureau formed a team to reply to the workers by 3:00 PM in the afternoon, and the workers resumed work.

Workers Accept the Authorities' Mediation

At around 1:00 PM yesterday afternoon, twelve employee representatives went to the Social Affairs Bureau. Aibelock, the general manager of the British Tramway Company, and Harvey, the chief accountant, also came to the scene. Zhang Zhenyuan, the section chief of the Social Affairs Bureau, and Zhu Chenghao worked hard to mediate and sincerely explained to the employee representatives the authorities' efforts to seek welfare for the workers. The representatives were quite moved and agreed to explain the situation to all the workers. The employees' request for the company to publicize the salaries of all employees has also been approved by the management to be published on Wednesday. At that time, the employees will submit concrete measures for wage adjustments, which will be handed over to the Social Affairs Bureau for processing.

### Minyu Ship Sinks Thorough Investigation of Causes Underway Yesterday, Busy with Salvage

The Minsheng Company's Minyu ship suddenly sank in the Huangpu River at Pier No. 3 the day before yesterday morning. Yesterday, salvage work was in full swing. The goods that have been recovered include cotton yarn, cotton cloth, groceries, and more than ten barrels of diesel fuel, all stacked on the shore of Pier No. 3. However, the ship was carrying a total of more than 460 pieces of cargo and passenger belongings, and less than half of them have been recovered. Most regrettably, a large number of books donated to the Beibei Library by Zeng Bokang, the manager of Ouxin Yusha Factory and Xianfu Company,

a large number of books

were among the cargo. A batch of more than seventy boxes had already been shipped out on the Minquan ship last week, and this was the second batch of fifty boxes (more than one hundred boxes have not yet been shipped), and it has suffered this misfortune. As of yesterday, the unloading work has not yet been completed and will continue today. It is expected that the ship can be floated to the surface tomorrow. According to the person in charge of the company, the sinking of the Minyu ship has caused the company

major losses

After the ship is salvaged, it will have to be put into dry dock for major repairs again. Regarding the passengers, a solution has been negotiated. Those who wish to go to Chongqing immediately can take the Minzu ship, which will set sail for Yichang on the 24th, and then transfer to Chongqing. Otherwise, they can take other Minsheng Company ships within a limited period. As for the lost luggage and other items of the passengers, registration has already been processed yesterday, and they will be returned separately after they are recovered. As for the

issue of responsibility

It is reported that the cause has been investigated, and the company authorities will punish the negligent personnel. Wang Fucheng, the captain of the ship, and Zeng Xianzhang, the cargo chief, are suspected of considerable negligence and have been detained. A decision will be made after the ship is brought out of the water and the responsibility is determined. In addition, Chen Haishan, the pilot who died in the accident, was from Hankou and was sixty years old. He had served for many years. The company authorities believe that the employee has made many contributions in the past and unfortunately died tragically, so they will provide preferential compensation. His body is being salvaged and the customs and water police bureau have been notified. Zhao Zhicheng, another injured ship policeman, is from Sichuan and is over thirty years old. After being rescued, his life is not in danger.

General O'Land's Christmas Message

Five-Star General O'Land, Commander-in-Chief of the U.S. Air Force, specially published a Christmas message to the U.S. Air Force all over the world, stating: "Today, we are peacefully spending Christmas in an atmosphere full of peace around the world.

### Remaining Supplies from China-India-Burma-U.S. All Donated to China

### Prelude to Christmas Calling on Santa Claus to Pity the Poor and Orphaned

— Mai Tian

The first Christmas after the victory is coming tomorrow, and everyone seems to be more excited than in previous years, buying gifts and planning banquets to have a big carnival. But in fact, this year's Christmas is still not as good as before the war.

"After the great war, people have lost their vitality. Many people cannot even afford a winter coat today, and many people are wandering on the streets, unable to find shelter. Not to mention the poor, even some middle-class families often have empty rice jars and oil tanks. Where do they have the qualifications to enjoy happiness? Here, Christmas is a holiday exclusively for a limited number of classes. But the limited classes are limited after all. Isn't it? You will find that there are far fewer people buying fancy gifts in department stores than in previous years. Although there is a lack of imported goods this year and there is no way to decorate, even outside the few brightly decorated tree windows, there are only a few onlookers. Flower baskets and foreign wines decorated very beautifully with many patterns, but the number of people asking about them is not enthusiastic. Jing'an Temple Road and Xiafei Road, Christmas trees are arranged in long rows at the entrances of flower shops, but they are not as lush as walking into a park like walking past Little Sandu Road and Jing'an Temple Road in the past.

Having said that, those who can breathe a sigh of relief and enjoy themselves to the fullest on Christmas will not want to miss this opportunity. Dance halls, cafes, restaurants, and theaters will undoubtedly be crowded. Many dance halls and restaurants have already been booked. No matter how expensive the Christmas dinner is, many guests have already booked it. However, some Western restaurants are preparing for a big sacrifice, only adding dishes but not increasing prices. Although the weather station reports that there may be no snow scene to decorate Christmas, the bands in the dance halls, restaurants, and tea rooms have already been playing the beautiful song "White Christmas" to welcome Christmas. In addition, many people take advantage of this rare holiday to travel to Hangzhou and Suzhou, which is a very interesting thing.

Christmas is not yet considered a major event in the eyes of Chinese people, but for foreigners, it is very different. Christmas is more important than the New Year. The U.S. military's department stores and Chinese antique embroidery shops shipped a large number of Christmas gifts to the United States weeks ago. But the American soldiers also think that things are too expensive and don't want to buy much. The British Red Cross held four banquets to entertain European children staying in Shanghai. The American Red Cross is inviting 25 Chinese children to participate in a Christmas party at Jiangwan Airport and distributing candies and gifts. The gifts given by the British Information Office to all employees were especially rich, with each person receiving a large cardboard box containing cigarettes, candies, and various things. The American Red Cross will ship 75,000 gift packages from Calcutta, India, to British soldiers in China. The "parties" of the British army in Shanghai will be distributed everywhere, and canned turkeys have already been shipped. It is said that the police bureau has agreed to the request of the British army to temporarily relax the curfew tonight. Therefore, most of the all-night "parties" are already being planned. Finally, I sincerely appeal to Santa Claus on behalf of those children who lost their parents during the war, can he please change his policy and shift his target this year, and go to the slums to give alms!"

### City Factories Installing Prime Movers Facing Difficulties Reducing Coal Consumption

According to a survey by the Chinese Technical Association, due to the difficulty in coal supply and the shortage of electricity, factories in Shanghai have had to find ways to install prime movers themselves, totaling 478 units, equivalent to 10,916 horsepower. Among them, 364 are wood gasifiers, totaling 6,761 horsepower; 49 are diesel engines, totaling 921 horsepower; and 65 are steam engines, totaling 3,234 horsepower. The types of factories that have installed these prime movers are classified as: (1) machinery and hardware ironworks; (2) cotton, iron, and woolen mills; (3) silk and silk weaving factories; (4) chemical factories; (5) cigarette factories; (6) dyeing factories; (7) printing factories; (8) yarn factories; (9) miscellaneous grain and flour mills; (10) rubber factories; (11) paper mills; (12) coal briquette factories; (13) tanneries; (14) knitting factories; (15) foundries. Among them, machinery factories have the most with 79 units, followed by cotton weaving factories with 62 units. Except for the five steam engines of Chongxin Yarn Factory, which were installed before the war, the rest were installed within the last two years. The result of the installation of prime movers by various factories has alleviated the coal panic problem of power plants. In the past, power plants needed 150,000 tons of coal per month, but now 80,000 tons per month can be resolved.

### City Finance Bureau Official Talks About the Truth of Levying Business Tax, There is No Penalty of 20 Times

It was recently heard that the two Central Commissioners, based on the merchants' statements, telegraphed the Central Government regarding the city's business tax matter: (1) The business tax has not yet been transferred to the Direct Taxation Bureau. (2) The Direct Taxation Bureau announced that it would be levied from October 21st of this year in accordance with the Ministry's order. (3) The Finance Bureau not only retroactively collected the business tax before October 21st but also imposed a penalty of 20 times the amount on merchants who failed to pay on time, which concerns government orders and public opinion, and requested a ruling. After inquiring with the Shanghai Finance Bureau and the City Chamber of Commerce, the person in charge of the Finance Bureau stated: (1) The business tax was originally a local tax, and the Central Government in Shanghai has never collected it. Since the establishment of the Direct Taxation Bureau, the city government has been in consultation with the Ministry of Finance on whether to entrust the local government to collect it on its behalf, so as to save time and expenses with the existing mechanism and be familiar with the situation, achieving twice the result with half the effort. After repeated consultations, a decision has not yet been made, so it has not been transferred. (2) Direct Taxation Bureau Notice No. 29 states that it will be levied from the date of the establishment of the bureau. October 21st is the date of the establishment of the bureau. The city government and various bureaus were established on September 12th. Before the tax was transferred and the bureau was established, it should still belong to the local government. (3) The business tax is collected quarterly. Some paid during the puppet regime, and some did not. Since it is not convenient to return the paid ones, in order to be fair and reasonable, only those who have not paid will be retroactively collected. On the one hand, it was found that the tax rate of the puppet regime was lower than that stipulated by our Central Government. In order to show consideration for the people's hardship, the original tax rate was still used. In fact, the business books of various merchants at that time were counterfeit money, and since the tax was levied according to the original rate and then converted into legal currency at a discount of 200 to 1, the amount was actually very limited. The total amount for spring and summer is only over 43 million, which is not even one-third or one-quarter of the current monthly collection of entertainment and banquet taxes. It is purely for the purpose of rectification and cleaning up and is not intended to increase the burden on the people. (4) Regarding the penalty of 20 times for late payment, it was found to be half to five times, which was handled in accordance with the provisions of the Business Tax Law, and there was no penalty of 20 times. If there was, it was only the special consumption tax collected by merchants on behalf of the puppet regime. Because the merchants had collected it from consumers and repeatedly urged them to pay, they were delayed in paying, which would be tantamount to embezzling public funds, so the penalty was increased in the hope of early settlement. In fact, those who paid on time were also required to pay, and there were not many who were penalized. When asked about the above matters, the Chamber of Commerce stated that they were also true.

### National Ship Allocation Committee's Takeover Principles Have Been Stipulated, Ship Allocation Methods Proceeding Smoothly

After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, the government paid special attention to water transportation. The Ministry of Communications has divided the handling of enemy and puppet ships into three stages. First, a Ship Reception Committee was established, with Shen Zhongyi as the chairman. When the reception of enemy and puppet ships was completed, the Jinghu District Ship Consolidation Committee was established, with Liu Hongsheng as the chairman. At the same time, the Ship Reception Committee was abolished. Last month, the Consolidation Committee completed the consolidation of enemy and puppet ships and was reorganized into the National Ship Allocation Committee, with Liu Hongsheng as the chairman, to allocate ships and supply military and public transportation matters. The committee's organization regulations consist of 15 articles, which have been submitted to the Executive Yuan for record by the Ministry of Communications. The four principles of the takeover method are recorded below: (1) All water transportation agencies that have been ordered to be abolished shall handle the closing matters themselves. (2) Except for the existing transportation tools of each agency that can be used for long-distance transportation, all of which shall be temporarily received by the Allocation Committee and handed over to the China Merchants Bureau for unified allocation and use, the rest shall still be handled by each agency itself. (3) Before the establishment of the committee and its subordinate agencies, the allocation of military and public transportation matters shall still be temporarily handled by the original agencies. (4) The committee's Shanghai and Chongqing offices are scheduled to be established on December 1st, and its subordinate agencies should be established at the same time, depending on the actual situation, to avoid delays. The committee has been established for half a month, and everything is proceeding smoothly. Before the completion of military and public transportation affairs, there will be no more changes in the organization.

### Qibao Town Bloodshed: Husband and Wife Shot and Killed

Xia Shengyu, a 37-year-old local resident of Nanda Street in Qibao Town, Shanghai West, used to be a secret agent for the puppet Songjiang County Police Bureau.

### The Spirit of Traditional Chinese Painting and National Integrity

— Shi Chongpeng

Traditional Chinese painting can cultivate temperament and influence humanity. Its essence and subtlety lie not only in the training of techniques but also in the cultivation of character. Therefore, famous painters throughout the ages have possessed extraordinary character and a serene demeanor. The spirit of peace and detachment of our Chinese nation is fully expressed in traditional Chinese painting, inspiring and arousing those who are indulgent in desires, ignorant of reason, greedy for profit, and forgetful of righteousness to be vigilant and repentant. Wu Daozi of the Tang Dynasty created the "Hell Transformation Painting," which caused executioners to abandon their careers out of fear of crime, demonstrating its transformative power. Other religious Buddhist paintings, lyrical landscape paintings, historical figure paintings, and aesthetic flower and animal paintings are all solemn, simple, gentle, and faithful, attracting and inspiring deep reflection, with inexplicable wonders.

Since traditional Chinese painting contains this subtle spirit, over time, it has become a widespread and profound concept of elegance. From emperors and generals to scholars and students, all strive to learn it in order to sing of elegance, forming a strange and wonderful flower and fruit of national culture. Whenever foreign insults and national crises occur, upright individuals leisurely retreat, and all their loyal and passionate emotions for serving the country are entrusted to painting. Everything, from vigorous and unyielding pine and cypress trees to fragrant and quiet orchids, pure white winter plums, steadfast and virtuous green bamboos, self-admiring frost chrysanthemums, unsullied landscapes, and non-worldly figures, becomes the object of traditional Chinese painting, symbolizing their lofty and loyal patriotic thoughts. Retreating to the mountains and forests, being leisurely and free, seems rather passive on the surface, but in fact, holding this non-cooperative attitude, pouring emotions into painting, awakens the Chinese people. Figures such as the Four Masters of the Yuan Dynasty, and Ni Yuanlu and Zheng Suonan of the Ming Dynasty, inspired by loyalty, righteousness, and a strong sense of justice, with their feelings for their homeland overflowing in their works, not only alerted the shameless traitors of the time but also, thousands of years later, when people unroll the scrolls, they are touched and admire the scenery, giving people a feeling of strictness and integrity, comparable to the national heroes who served on the battlefield.

Traditional Chinese painting can express national integrity. Since it is so profound and great, and the deeds of loyal painters in history are so inviolable, the influence of the trend is far-reaching. Therefore, during the eight years from the Anti-Japanese War to the victory, the traditional Chinese painters in the occupied areas were able to strictly adhere to their positions and endure hardships, and they did not disgrace their predecessors. Even the few calligraphers who were forced to compromise due to the environment still expressed in their works a sense of remaining waters and broken mountains, songs of sadness and generosity, and their hearts longing for their homeland, which had not diminished in the slightest. Now that the rivers and mountains have been restored and the world has been restored, it is deeply hoped that my colleagues in the field of traditional Chinese painting will understand that traditional Chinese painting has a unique spirit of safeguarding national integrity. The depth of its meaning is the highest level of world art. Strengthen efforts, continue to expand and create excellent and unique works of the times, spread them all over the world, so that all mankind is immersed in the rich, peaceful, and detached Chinese painting, understand the inviolable national integrity of our nation, eliminate all cruel and ferocious things, and together ascend to a happy world of equality and harmony.

### Fallen Leaves in the Wind and Rain

— Tian

A thin layer of light ink wash shrouds the sky. Dark clouds line the horizon, resembling a transforming black dragon, or a ferocious and terrifying demon, making a frightening appearance that causes one to sigh deeply with a sense of endless melancholy. The wind blows with a rustling sound, not piercingly cold, but winter is still terrible, bringing a shivering chill that soaks the air in a murky, desolate, and depressing environment. Added to this is a drizzling rain that has been falling all night, leaving many puddles on the road. The streets are sparsely populated in the early morning. Indeed, no one wants to go out in this gloomy and bitter weather, especially on this usually quiet road, where only two rows of withered plane trees quietly accompany the cold wind and silent rain, forming a desolate and bleak picture.

The plane trees have lost their crowns; the vibrant green leaves are long gone! Only some withered, yellowed leaves remain on the branches, unable to withstand the ravages of the harsh wind. They lie down, shake, frown, and look sorrowful, unsure of how much longer they can survive. In twos and threes, they are blown away from their mother's embrace, falling to the ground, into the ditches, and into the puddles, with tears streaming down. On a clear day, they could still linger on the ground, rolling with the north wind, rustling. But now? They stick to the slippery ground, submerged in the puddles, gradually becoming stained! Waiting for people's merciless trampling. Sympathetic souls! Can you not hear their final lament? "Mother! Why are people warming themselves by the stove while I suffer unreasonable abuse here?" But the north wind and bitter rain continue to mercilessly harm these innocent little lives. The fallen leaves fall piece by piece with sorrow. Only the leaves that still have some green and yellow hues, not yet withered but about to decay, still cling to their mother's embrace, struggling with the enemy, struggling, awaiting their final fate!

Fallen leaves! Don't be haggard, don't shed any more tears! Which creature in the world doesn't share your fate? Even people! You think they are the luckiest of all! But they too cannot escape this misfortune, and may even suffer a more unfortunate fate than you. When they are young, strong, and full of vitality, when their reputation is high and their power is evident, what kind of person, what kind of environment does not flatter them, fawn over them, and bow down to them? What kind of person, what kind of environment does not compliment them, humbly praise them, and gild the lily? But when they become old, weak, and reach the end of their road, when their reputation declines and their power disappears, what kind of person, what kind of environment does not mock them, despise them, bully them, and humiliate them? What kind of person, what kind of environment does not become arrogant, overbearing, and wantonly ridicule them? Fallen leaves! Although you are now groaning under the iron hooves of wind and rain, you are old! You are haggard! Youth cannot be repeated, and beauty cannot last forever. But when the sky clears, the sun shines on the earth, and the cold wind dries your body, there will be a cleaner to take care of you, to sweep you away and put you in a dustpan. There will also be a poor woman who pities you, to collect you and put you in a broken basket. Although your end is still a dirty garbage can, a blazing stove; don't grieve, don't be sad! This ending is at least better than being humiliated and wantonly ridiculed when people reach the end of their road, isn't it? Much better, isn't it?

### I Accuse!

— Shangguan Shen

Let me tell you a story:

A few months after the September 18th Incident, a notice was posted on the streets of the northeastern provinces, recruiting laborers. It didn't specify what was being built, but the generous compensation attracted many unemployed compatriots.

They signed up, and a few days later, they were transported by truck to a large building. In the dead of night, these deceived people entered the building one by one.

Inside this building, they began to work.

The work—was to dig a tunnel under the building, to build an arsenal there.

Except for two meals a day, they received nothing. All day long, they dug and piled in the dark cellar. If anyone was lazy, a whip would leave a bloody mark on their back.

Some couldn't bear the hardship and asked to quit. They would give you an injection in your arm or knee, and you would go blind, open your mouth, and become mute, your whole body feeling numb.

And new workers were constantly being recruited.

Three months passed, and an arsenal with all sorts of secret equipment was completed. Those who had lived through ninety days of hell looked at each other with bloodshot eyes, waiting. They felt guilty, realizing that they had done something wrong, something wrong that was now completed. They no longer hoped for the brutalizers to pay them, but only wanted to be let out, to go home, to tell every Chinese person: under that grand building is an arsenal that will slaughter countless compatriots.

The day they had been waiting for finally arrived. Dozens of Japanese military police led them out of the underground. It was dark and gloomy outside, late at night.

They were herded into trucks. A dozen trucks disappeared into the darkness.

Day after day passed, and patches of blood floated on the calm river surface. People curiously fished them out. Corpses floated up, not just one, but ten, a hundred…

This was the reward for their work for the Japanese.

Ten years passed in a flash. No one could forget the bloodstains of ten years ago. The wives and children of those who were murdered were still alive, waiting for the day when those who killed their husbands and fathers would repay this blood debt.

Those rapists finally drank their own poison. They learned a lesson, but they did not receive the retribution they deserved.

Were the sacrifices of those thousands upon thousands of compatriots who were drowned at sea in vain?

I accuse!

### Japanese Pig Song

— Xu Zeren

During the war, the Japanese invaders had what was called the "Cultural Service Association." This was an organization of painters, musicians, and playwrights who went to the battlefield to encourage the invasion with their skills. In 1942, this Cultural Service Association published a collection called "Sketches from the Front," published by the Japan Telegraph Communication Agency. The book was a large, sixteen-format volume of 290 pages, two-thirds of which were illustrations and one-third text, recommended by the Ministry of the Army and prefaced by Sakurai. Needless to say, the book was full of insults to China and boasts of the Japanese invaders. Here is a quick example: On page 150 of the book, the top half depicts a large pig, two small pigs, and two geese. The bottom half is a pig song that says:

"Black and clumsy you,

When we first occupied the Wusong Paper Mill,

It was you we met!

A pig indeed, what a surprise!

But knowing that, it seems kind of cute.

So is your master.

So is your country.

I’m so busy, but I need to know your business!”

The author is a fellow named Takaezawa Keiichi, probably a painter, as he drew quite a few pictures in the book. This enemy who insulted us as pigs may still be in Shanghai, living in a beautiful apartment, treated with respect as a cultural figure, invited to tea parties to talk about East Asian civilization!

### What Kind of Painting Do We Need?

— Wen Zhaotong

Many people are asking: What kind of painting does China need at this stage?

Traditional Chinese painters say: We should promote our inherent art and promote national culture. The current stage is a period of national reconstruction, and the essence of the country should be preserved. So we need traditional Chinese painting.

Oil painters say: Oil painting has rich expressiveness and scientific production methods. In the national reconstruction stage, we still need to absorb nutrients. Therefore, oil painting is the most needed art form.

Cartoonists say: Cartoons are an art that guides the public and exposes reality. How should the public proceed in the era of national reconstruction? What should a reasonable reality be like? Only cartoons can best shoulder this task. So cartoons are the most needed painting at present.

In the national reconstruction stage, the essence of the country should be preserved, foreign culture should be absorbed, and the correct grasp of the theme of art is also very necessary. However, the expressiveness of traditional Chinese painting is weak, oil painting lacks the characteristics of Chinese national art, and cartoons only have momentary publicity and stimulation. Using them to coordinate the process of national reconstruction and obtain the revival of Chinese art is not enough. I think that the kind of painting we need at this stage is: a theme that fits reality, a grand, vigorous, and sublime momentum, which must be extracted from the techniques of cartoons and the spirit of traditional Chinese painting. However, if the expressiveness of oil painting cannot be possessed, the result will still fall into emptiness and weakness. Because oil painting today is no longer an art unique to Westerners, but an art of the world, just as airplanes and cars are not transportation tools unique to the West, but tools that can be used by all mankind.

### Time

— Tian

Flipping through the calendar, the pages fly by one by one. Days are like a stream of turbid water, flowing without stopping. Life is a lump of mud, dyed by dirty water, becoming even dirtier.

Hope is even more endless. The days always increase and never decrease. Time, past, never returns, piling up in countless heaps behind us. Without a moment to breathe, we welcome the days flying over us again. Joy and sorrow, the past has become a relic, piled together; the future is endless, unpredictable.

Smiles are like dreams, but frowns appear real. People have an unnecessary selfishness and jealousy, thinking that joy is always empty, intangible, and that sorrow pierces the heart like a sword. When everything becomes a relic, when tolerance and generosity reach this level, people also get old. Beauty and youth float in the gentle song of regret. The wrinkles on the face are the track of life. Experience is the deep mark carved on a smooth face. Beauty and loveliness should be submerged in the passing time. Youth is only once, and all enjoyment becomes empty. Therefore, "Alas, life is a dream!"

But sorrow and dissatisfaction pierce the heart like a sword. Reality is a cruel whip, not allowing people to have a moment of forgetful joy. Time flows as quickly as possible. After one day, there is tomorrow. Having endured enough suffering of sorrow, hope also accumulates more and more.

Everything turns into relics, following the passage of time. Sorrow is thrown behind us, and greater hope is hidden in the years to come.

### Haiyan After the Calamity

— Yi Jun

My hometown, Haiyan in Zhejiang Province, is located in a strategic position in the Qiantang River. Without layered mountains and peaks or vast floods, it is located on a plain with convenient transportation and prosperous commerce. In Sun Yat-sen's industrial plan, it was planned to be developed into a major Eastern port, and it was essentially an important national defense fortress.

After the July 7th Incident, the Japanese army used Haiyan and Jinshanwei as landing points: concentrating artillery fire and fiercely attacking day and night. The National Army could not withstand it, fighting and retreating, and finally fell into enemy hands in mid-October.

When the Japanese army first occupied Haiyan, it went without saying that they massacred, looted, and set fires. They captured young men and tied them together with iron wire through their palms, or tied them to trees, and then slaughtered them with machine guns or bayonets. If they were lucky enough to recover, they were thrown into the swamps, without a single survivor. Their barbaric behavior was utterly inhumane and chilling.

All the buildings in the city were burned, becoming a pile of rubble, only feeling a sense of desolation. The former public education hall, library, and sports ground facilities were all destroyed, and the education cause was completely destroyed.

The city walls were collapsed by artillery fire. The Tianning Pagoda was also penetrated by shells, covered in wounds, and in danger of collapsing. The generators and streetlights and poles in the electric power company before the war were all planned to be carried away by the Japanese invaders.

Now the market is sluggish, and it feels even more desolate at night. Tracing back to the prosperity of the past cannot help but make people feel depressed.

### Water

— Li Chunkang

Hot water costs ten yuan per scoop, and it is not easy to drink a cup of boiling water. The common people are in deep water and scorching fire.

The importance of a stove is second only to the water supply. It is simply nonsense for them to freely raise prices without the approval of the authorities.

Stoves have never been as free to operate as ordinary stores and have regulations on location. Ordinary stores are also subject to price limits, but stoves with special regulations are acting recklessly, and it is absolutely necessary to impose emergency sanctions.

How to sanction them? The only way is to transfer the stove to the management of the Public Works Bureau, so that every move is subject to the strict management of the municipal authorities, so that it will no longer be manipulated by the guild like an ordinary store.

Cultural Communication

### World Art Capital

— Wen Zhaotong

Before World War II, needless to say, Paris was the world's art capital, but since the Nazis occupied it in 1940, the position of the world's art capital naturally disappeared.

Where should the world's art capital be established today? This naturally depends on the traditional cultural, political, and economic conditions.

However, we must also note that today's art is bound to develop with the rise of the spirit of democracy. In other words: today's art is working for the culture, freedom, and happiness of mankind. It will not be sentimental and decadent art, or deformed and morbid expressions.

From this point of view, the foundation of the world's art capital lies in the country that can best express the spirit of democracy in the world. There is no doubt about this.

### To the Tune of "Linjiang Xian" (Written in 1934)

— Wu Renzhi

Classmate Ci Hui's family fell into a puppet state. Thinking of his homeless soul, I felt even more keenly the vicissitudes of our home and country. I write this to mourn him.

The vicissitudes of the family and country are endlessly regrettable; our classmates shed hot tears together—returning to Liaotian is too unbearable to grieve; the rivers and mountains still seem the same as before, but human affairs are completely different! The remnant game after the calamity is like this, it's so pitiful that the soul is homeless! The bird of fine feathers does not fly to the mountains of Shu; watching the border passes, azaleas are stained with blood.

### How to Improve Teachers' Lives

— Yi Fei

Education is the lifeblood of the country. In countries with developed education, the knowledge, thoughts, behavior, integrity, etc. of their citizens must have good performances, full of vigor and energy. Today, our country can be called "New China." To popularize future education, we should first pay attention to the serious problems of current teachers' lives. The refugee and child shelter established by the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau is quite large in scale. The other day, a university professor surnamed Zhu suddenly sent his three daughters and two sons to request accommodation. His reason was that his meager salary was not enough to make ends meet, and it was better to seek a way out than to starve to death sooner or later. He had a total of eight children. After careful consideration, he selected the group that was relatively young and sent them to the shelter with heartache. The oldest was already sixteen years old, and the youngest was less than four years old. A university professor is so poor, and the situation of others can be imagined. Compatriots with compassion will never remain indifferent! The author dares to ask the wise authorities to quickly plan a practical and effective way to save these poor and sacred teachers who are "pale, without a drop of oil in their stomachs," pigeon-like, crane-faced, hungry, and cold. Teachers are indeed people with great merits to the country and society. They will not "wear long sleeves to dance well," but only know how to work hard and educate talents for the country and nation. Therefore, European and American countries have special preferential regulations for teachers. Thinking of how important the education cause of "New China" is, improving treatment is urgently needed.

Reader Letters

### Inquiring About Half-Price Treatment for Lung Disease

Shen Bao reader Cheng Jichao wrote: "Editor: I have read about 'Worry-Free Theory of Lung Disease' in your column for several days, which reminds me that I had hemoptysis four years ago. After being treated with 'air needle' injections at the Nanyang Hospital, the symptoms disappeared completely in just over three months. The doctor said that I needed to have injections for a year, but as a result, I could no longer afford them due to economic reasons. At the same time, after another medical X-ray, it was determined that there was no disease in the lungs, so I automatically stopped the injections. There have been no symptoms for four years, but in the past six months, there seem to be recurring symptoms. I am a store employee with a minimum monthly income. Getting reasonable treatment is like 'taking the moon from the sky,' which is desirable but unattainable. Knowing that this will become incurable if it continues, what can I do about economic hardship? Therefore, I dare to inquire in your column: Is there any place in Shanghai that provides free or cheap X-rays? After the X-ray, are there any free or cheap treatment hospitals? I ask that you publicly answer these two questions so that I can follow them with gratitude."

(Editor's Answer) Our column specifically offers Tongde Hospital, Nanyang Hospital, and Hongqiao Sanatorium, which can provide half-price X-ray examinations, and treatment can also be preferential. Please come for treatment after the examination.
