### Japanese Special Attack Unit Raids Manila, Continued Street Fighting; Most of the Bustling City Reduced to Ashes

Luzon Front, 14th (Central News Agency Telegram) – The street fighting in Manila is still ongoing intensely. The enemy forces that invaded from the east via Paco Station have been blocked by the Japanese garrison. A artillery battle between the two armies continues in the Paco western region of the southern bank of the Pasig River. In the Nichols Airfield area, Japanese army and naval forces are cooperating closely and fighting bravely against over a thousand enemy soldiers with a dozen tanks. However, a part of the enemy forces from the Paco area suddenly appeared behind the Japanese army since the 6th. By the 10th, these enemy forces finally invaded Nichols Airfield and captured the runway. At this time, a Japanese special attack unit inflicted great damage on the enemy. Moreover, in order to quickly capture Manila, the enemy has been busily transporting troops and ammunition using two hundred transport vehicles near Marilao, 20 kilometers east of Bulacan Province, for several days. Apart from this, there has been little change on the other Luzon front lines. The enemy at Nasugbu has been blocked by a small number of Japanese soldiers at the narrow pass near Ayala. By the 11th, they had only occupied both sides of the main road, which was about 500 meters wide. The enemy is currently transporting tanks towards Dagat via heavy artillery cover. In response, a Japanese special attack unit infiltrated, resulting in the enemy being repeatedly threatened. They are attempting to move a portion of their forces south from Nasugbu and are currently engaging in combat with the Japanese army near a location 15 kilometers east of Nasugbu. Additionally, the enemy hastily constructed the Nasugbu Airfield, but by the 10th, it could only be used by small aircraft. On the 11th, a Japanese special attack unit infiltrated it, killing and wounding over 300 enemy soldiers. Also, in the northern Bataan peninsula, near the foothills of Mount Natib, small-scale battles between the two armies continue. In the Clark area, the Japanese forces guarding the western highlands of Banay continue their artillery fire, preventing the enemy's airfield from being used by large aircraft. On the northern front line, the Japanese garrison in Muñoz is currently fighting bravely against enemy forces approaching from all directions with a small force. Up to the 9th, it has been confirmed that the achieved results include killing or wounding over 3,000 enemy soldiers, destroying 15 artillery pieces, 10 rapid-fire guns, 6 mortars, 8 tanks, and numerous cargo trucks.

Luzon Front, 14th (Central News Agency Telegram) – When American forces invaded the northern part of Manila, the elite Japanese forces immediately engaged them in fierce battle. At this time, about 10,000 local bandits took advantage of the chaos to sneak into the city and plunder at will. As a result, most of the bustling "Escolta" street and its northern Chinese Quarter, lined with department stores, theaters, and luxurious shops, were reduced to ashes. After the rebel army crossed the Pasig River, the center of the decisive battle expanded to the Intramuros area of the old city. The vicious bandits also set fires on a large scale in this area, and famous temples, fortresses, etc., were completely burned down, leaving Filipinos and Chinese crowded in the narrow streets without any place to escape, bewildered and helpless, as if in a living hell.

### Vicinity of Breslau, Germany Launches Counteroffensive; Hungarian Garrison Breaks Through Encirclement

Berlin, 14th (Central News Agency Telegram) – The great battle in Central-Western Silesia remains fluid. The fighting has now expanded to the Geis River, a tributary of the Lohbr River. The Soviet army's fierce attack on Sagan was repelled, and Konev's plan to encircle Breslau has failed again. The corridor west of the city has expanded due to German flanking attacks. However, the Soviet army is still reinforcing between Breslau and Liegnitz, with the vanguard reaching Jauer, 20 kilometers south of Liegnitz. The Soviet forces currently gathered on the Breslau front include the Second Armored Corps, four army groups, and around ten independent units. Fierce fighting is expected to continue there. Several Soviet divisions are advancing southeast on the Liegnitz-Breslau highway, while another five Soviet divisions are advancing north and northwest from the Brzeg bridgehead, attempting to encircle Breslau, but there have been no significant results so far.

Berlin, 14th (Central News Agency Telegram) – Recent European War Situation: (1) The Soviet army near Breslau in the Eastern Front attempted to encircle the city, but the German army launched a counteroffensive, ultimately cutting off the Soviet connection and completely destroying the enemy attempt to cut off transportation between the area and Berlin, thus completely relieving the crisis on the southern defense line of Berlin. Konev's powerful troops, starting from the Liegnitz area, reinforced the Soviet forces attempting to encircle Breslau at every opportunity. The German counteroffensive in that area achieved considerable results, destroying 60 Soviet tanks. Also, in order to cut off the German rear lines of communication in the East Prussia area, the Soviet army subjected the cities of Elbing and Königsberg to intense artillery fire. The German-Hungarian forces defending Budapest, after completing all food and material supplies, turned to field warfare, and on the 13th at dawn, they gathered all their forces to attempt to break through the Soviet encirclement. The German attack took advantage of the Soviet's vulnerability, giving them no time to counterattack, and three Soviet regiments were annihilated and routed.

Western Front Situation

(2) On the Western Front, the US Third Army's attempt to link the Remich-Echternach-Wellen-Losheim bridgeheads in Luxembourg and move north was also blocked by heavy German artillery fire. Looking at the Western Front situation, the Allied offensive on the northern wing seems to have had some success, while the German defenses on the southern wing remain strong.

Berlin, 14th (Central News Agency Telegram) – DNB reports: The fighting on the Western Front is mainly occurring between the Meuse and Waal rivers, where the British-Canadian forces have broken through, as well as at the Hürtgenwald, Prüm, and Saar bridgeheads. In Lower Alsace, there is only local fighting. The ground between the Waal River and Cleves is muddy, and the Allied advance is only possible on relatively dry roads. The British tank vanguard has been blocked a few kilometers south and southeast of Cleves. The British attempt to cross the Niers River failed. The water level in the Ruhr area continues to rise, forcing the enemy to quickly retreat.

### Ganzhou – An Important Tungsten Ore Producing Area; Gains from the Japanese Army's Operations in Gan

After capturing Suichuan on the 28th day of the old year (Lunar year), the Japanese rapid deployment forces, which relentlessly pursued the fleeing Chongqing army's 14th Division, reached and occupied the Ganzhou airfield on the morning of February 5th. On the same day, at dusk, they also captured the county seat. The rapid pursuit from Suichuan to Ganzhou involved traversing the treacherous mountain roads in the Wanyang Mountain range. When approaching Ganzhou, the Chongqing army, due to the rapid advance of the Japanese army, had no time to thoroughly destroy the roads and only damaged the road surface.

Ganzhou Airfield

The Ganzhou airfield is located in the large bend of the Zhang River. Compared to the Suichuan airfield, it has a stronger sense of being newly constructed. In the pine forest west of the airfield, there are various buildings scattered around, and the auxiliary facilities are no less than those in Suichuan. When the Japanese army occupied the Suichuan airfield, about twenty damaged aircraft were left in the field, but the Ganzhou airfield only had the remains of six burnt aircraft.

The Ganzhou county seat is located at the confluence of the Gan River and the Zhang River. The city wall is about six meters high and four meters wide, with a population of over 60,000. The scene inside the city is very different from that of Suichuan, with not a single bunker to be seen. The Chongqing army defended the city, but when the Japanese army charged in with bayonets, they immediately retreated, so the city was almost undamaged.

Objectives of the Japanese Army

The purpose of the Japanese army's attack on Suichuan and Ganzhou was to destroy the Chongqing-US air force base. In addition to this great strategic outcome, one of the great achievements was the acquisition of over 1,500 tons of copper ore (with a probability of over 80% that it would be refined) inside and outside the Ganzhou county seat. Tungsten is a precious metal used to manufacture airplanes and other important weapons. The location of this operation is in Jiangxi Province, which is a world-important tungsten-producing area. This tungsten ore is an important resource for Chongqing to repay the US and Soviet aid to Chiang Kai-shek. In order to utilize this resource, the Japanese side formed a precious metal resource investigation team to advance with the army during this operation to open the Yuehan Railway and attack Suichuan and Ganzhou, to conduct on-the-spot investigations in preparation for development. According to Chongqing documents obtained in Ganzhou County, the recent tungsten ore production status in the Jiangxi Province area is reported as follows:

Tungsten Ore Production

The annual tungsten ore production in Jiangxi Province is approximately 10,000 tons (after ore dressing). The main producing areas include: Dayu, Chongyi, Qiannan, Huichang, Longnan, Taihe, Xingguo, Suichuan, Lingdu, Shangyou, Nankang, etc. (in order of output). The mines such as Xihua Mountain in Dayu County, Dajishan in Qiannan County, and Guiwan Mountain in Longnan County are well-known. Within Ganzhou County, there are about eighteen mines of various sizes, such as Bijia Mountain and Baishi Mountain. Due to transportation limitations, the mined ore is generally dressed at the mine and then transported to intermediate locations such as Nanxiong, Ganzhou, Xinfeng, and Dayu using rivers and roads. In the past, an office was established under the Jiangxi Provincial Government Resources Committee's Tungsten Industry Administration Office. After the ore was dressed, it was transported to Guilin via the Yuehan Railway for export to the United States and the Soviet Union. However, since the Japanese army's operations in Hunan last spring, it has been impossible to transport it, so mining has been suspended since July of last year.

### Japanese Army Obtains Large Quantities of Weapons in Ganzhou

Mainland Front Base, 14th (Central News Agency Telegram) – On the 10th, Japanese forces operating in China confiscated a large number of Chongqing army weapons near Ganzhou. The main items are as follows: 576 15cm howitzer shells, 600 square detonators for the shells, 4 tons of yellow explosive, 720 tons of black powder, 240 landmines, 560 fuses, 500 detonators, and 1,350 hand grenades.

### US Federal Reserve Proposes to Reduce Reserve Requirements

Lisbon, 14th (Central News Agency Telegram) – DNB reports from Washington: The US Federal Reserve Board has submitted several proposals to the US Senate Banking Committee, requesting a reduction in the gold reserves and deposits of the US Federal Reserve Banks. The proposal requests that the reserve for US paper currency be changed to 25%, and the reserve for gold deposits should also be 25%. The original paper currency reserve was 40%, and the gold deposit reserve was 35%. It is claimed that reducing the gold reserve for paper currency is necessary because the issuance of US paper currency has exceeded $25,000,000,000.

Editorial

### Population Evacuation and Entry Restrictions

Yesterday, we proposed "The First Task of the New Year," hoping that citizens living in Shanghai should consider evacuating back to their hometowns after the Spring Festival.

We said in our editorial on the 6th of this month: "In the past, Shanghai had concessions that could protect all criminal behavior, ignore national affairs, and ignore social affairs. Even when battles were approaching outside the concessions, one could simply stay within the concessions, lie down and listen to the sound of artillery, and remain unaffected, still enjoying life to the fullest." This was the abnormal phenomenon that arose in Shanghai due to the existence of concessions, fostering a group of dependent parasites who treated the concessions as a land of comfort and a protective talisman. However, since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the concessions immediately lost their foundation. After August of the year before last, all concessions were taken over, and the name "concession" became a relic of the past, and the abnormal phenomenon of relying on the concessions also lost its shield. Therefore, we are doing our best to awaken this dream of dependence. Those who do not need to reside in Shanghai should consider evacuating as soon as possible, especially the elderly, weak, women, children, and those who are idly spending public funds, charitable organizations, etc., should all prepare early. At the same time, we hope that the government authorities will quickly plan to ensure security in various regions so that those who evacuate back to their hometowns can receive a secure guarantee of life.

However, what should be paid the same attention to as implementing population evacuation, and what must be implemented simultaneously with evacuation, is the issue of restricting the entry of the population into the urban area. Implementing evacuation on one hand and implementing import restrictions on the other hand can achieve the real effect of evacuation. If only evacuation is implemented, and import is not restricted at the same time, then while there is evacuation on one side, there is still import on the other side. Wouldn't that be equivalent to not evacuating at all, completely losing the meaning of evacuation, and failing to achieve the effect of evacuation?

Therefore, we advocate implementing evacuation on one hand and implementing import restrictions at the same time. As for the regulations and implementation of import restriction measures, the following points can be referred to:

(1) Stipulate the regulations for restricting the entry of the population into the Shanghai urban area and the date of implementation. Those who do not have a legitimate occupation in Shanghai will not be allowed to enter after the implementation of the restrictions. The so-called legitimate occupation should strictly define the scope of occupations. Those that are directly or indirectly unnecessary for the wartime environment, even if they have an occupation, are not within the scope of permission, such as those employed in entertainment venues, hotels, restaurants, and industries and businesses with consumptive, luxurious, or speculative profiteering natures. On the other hand, those who are allowed to enter within the specified scope of occupations should hold a permission document applied for by the service agency or organization to the competent authority for import management; otherwise, they will not be allowed to enter either.

(2) Transportation agencies, such as trains, buses, ships, etc., should simultaneously check whether passengers carrying passengers to Shanghai from other places have an entry permit from the Shanghai urban area import management agency when selling tickets. Those who do not have this permit should not be sold passenger tickets.

(3) Those who originally had a legitimate occupation in Shanghai, but who have left Shanghai for some reason and still need to return, should first obtain a return entry permit from the competent authority before leaving Shanghai. If they have left Shanghai before the implementation of the restriction measures and still need to return, their service place should apply on their behalf and send it to them for verification when they come to Shanghai.

(4) The Baojia (local security) agencies, when applying for the issuance of citizen certificates, should simultaneously check whether there is an entry permit, if it is not a relocation within the original Shanghai urban area; otherwise, they should refuse and order them to leave Shanghai.

(5) The relocation and entry methods for family members of those with legitimate occupations who need to live together are the same as those for the person themselves.

(6) Staff should be stationed at each entry point in the Shanghai urban area (including waterways, docks, border iron gates) to verify entry permits, or entrusted to military and police personnel serving in each area to execute, and inspections should be carried out at any time.

Finally, we hope that the Municipal Government authorities will pay attention to this, formulate restriction measures, and establish management agencies, or simply attach them to the Baojia Office to be responsible for handling them. However, the application and verification procedures should adopt a fair attitude, be handled quickly, and provide applicants with absolute convenience.

### The Three-Headed Meeting Ends; Joint Declaration Issued; States that a Joint Military Plan Has Been Drafted

Stockholm, Sweden, 14th (Central News Agency Telegram) – DNB reports from London that Roosevelt, Churchill, and Stalin issued a joint declaration on Monday evening, stating that after consultations in Yalta on the Crimean coast, military cooperation among the three countries is closer than ever before, but this joint military plan will be announced only when it is implemented. This close cooperation may shorten the war. The staff members of the three countries will continue to meet at any time as needed. If Germany continues its hopeless resistance, it will only increase the price of its defeat. The Allies have decided on a plan for Germany's unconditional surrender, but this plan can only be announced when Germany is finally defeated. The Allies will make Germany compensate for the losses of the war with goods and will establish a compensation committee in Moscow to handle it.

Lisbon, 14th (Central News Agency Telegram) – DNB reports from Washington: US War Mobilization Bureau Director James F. Byrnes, returned from the meeting location of Roosevelt, Churchill, and Stalin yesterday, and declared a few hours later that the Allied military leaders currently meeting are planning to use more manpower and materials in March of this year than in any previous period.

White House Announces Details of the Meeting

Lisbon, 10th (Central News Agency Telegram) – A Washington dispatch states that the US White House announced the following details of the Crimean meeting on the 12th: President Roosevelt and his party arrived in Malta on February 2nd and met with British Prime Minister Churchill, US Secretary of State Edward Stettinius, US Ambassador to the Soviet Union Averell Harriman, Presidential Advisor Harry Hopkins, Chief of Staff George Marshall, Chief of Naval Operations Ernest King, and other military, political, and technical advisors. After the Malta meeting began, Roosevelt first met with Marshall and King, followed by a meeting with Churchill. Roosevelt and Churchill had dinner together on the 2nd, and that night they flew to a Soviet port on the Crimean coast. Under the welcoming of Soviet Foreign Minister Vyacheslav Molotov, Roosevelt took a car to Livadia, the former Black Sea coastal villa of Russian Emperor Nicholas II. The meeting was held inside the villa and began on February 5th, continuing day and night until it ended on the 11th.

Solution to the Polish Problem

Stockholm, Sweden, 14th (Central News Agency Telegram) – DNB reports that Roosevelt, Churchill, and Stalin decided on the following solution to the Polish problem at the Crimean Conference: After Poland is completely liberated by the Soviet army, it is necessary to establish a temporary government. The new government currently operating in Poland should be reorganized on a broader democratic basis, encompassing the democratic leaders of the Polish people at home and abroad. The name of this new government should be changed to the Polish National United Provisional Government. Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov, US Ambassador to the Soviet Union Harriman, and British Ambassador to the Soviet Union Kerr have been ordered to meet with Polish leaders in Moscow to reorganize the Polish government in accordance with the aforementioned principles. After the new government is organized, the British, American, and Soviet governments will establish diplomatic relations with it and exchange envoys. Poland's eastern border should follow the Curzon Line, with slight modifications in several places favorable to Poland. As for the southwestern border, it must be left to the peace conference to decide.

Stockholm, Sweden, 14th (Central News Agency Telegram) – DNB reports from London that the Polish government-in-exile in London issued a communiqué yesterday stating that before the start of the Crimean Conference, the Polish government had sent a note to the British and American governments, stating that with regard to decisions concerning Poland's fate, if they were not discussed with the Polish government and with the consent of the Polish government, the Polish government would take a disregardful attitude.

German Official Comments on the Yalta Conference

Berlin, 14th (Central News Agency Telegram) – DNB reports, the German Foreign Ministry spokesperson said yesterday: "The Yalta Conference communiqué is excellent, as the German leaders can use it to inspire the fighting spirit of the German people. Within the communiqué, only hatred and a determination to destroy others are seen. The enemies are only able to join hands because of this. Germany has never neglected or denied this matter. The points concerning Germany do not need to be discussed. After reading this communiqué, Germans feel that they would rather endure pain than allow this communiqué to be implemented one day. Millions of Germans will thoroughly sacrifice themselves and engage in guerrilla tactics. Every German will drag the enemy into the grave before they die. Germans often use the means of killing to retaliate for the means of killing. Eighty million Germans all know how to defend themselves. From this point of view, the Yalta communiqué has instead stimulated the psychological motivation for us to hate the enemy with the same hate. No matter is more stupid than this.” The spokesperson continued, "I do not believe that Germany's military strength cannot change the war situation in the near future. Germany has had more dangerous times in history than today. However, enemies should not ignore Germany's transcendent military and political leadership talents, as well as the danger of the Soviet army's deep penetration."

Paris Feels Deeply Disappointed

Stockholm, Sweden, 14th (Central News Agency Telegram) – DNB reports, UP reports that Paris feels deeply disappointed that de Gaulle was not invited to participate in the Crimean Conference.

### Consumption Tax Should Be Paid for Private Banquets of Civil Servants, etc., Severe Action Will Be Taken Against Those Who Refuse

The City Wine and Restaurant Trade Association has reported that disputes often arise when civil servants and military police officers refuse to pay the special consumption tax for private banquets, greatly hindering tax revenue. They have repeatedly petitioned the City Finance Bureau for instructions on how to handle this. To clarify the truth of this matter, this reporter interviewed a responsible person from the Finance Bureau yesterday, who stated: According to investigation, official banquets of government agencies are exempt from the special consumption tax on banquets, but only if the government agency has supporting documents for the bureau to verify before it takes effect. Private banquets of civil servants and military police officers are not exempt from tax, and the municipal government has already issued an order to comply. The special consumption tax is an important source of state revenue under the wartime system. All civil servants and military police officers are role models for the people and should be mindful of the difficult times. All private banquets should be taxed in accordance with regulations to maintain tax policy. In addition to submitting a request to the municipal government to issue a notice to be posted in various liquor businesses to inform the public, severe investigations will be conducted and no leniency will be shown if there are still cases of refusing to pay the special consumption tax on banquets.

### Securities Exchange Supervisory Office Sets Principles for Reviewing Stock Listings

The Shanghai Securities Exchange Supervisory Office of the Ministry of Finance believes that the original principles for reviewing applications for stock listings by companies, set by the Shanghai Securities Exchange, were too broad. Therefore, the office has formulated twelve articles of rules for reviewing stock listings on the Shanghai Securities Exchange to impose strict restrictions and prevent malpractices. The rules have been submitted to the Ministry of Finance for approval and have been promulgated and implemented by the office. From now on, listed stocks will undergo strict review, providing protection for stock market investors. Furthermore, due to significant tax evasion in over-the-counter transactions, the office has drafted seven articles of provisional measures for brokers of the Shanghai Chinese Securities Exchange to conduct transactions on behalf of clients. These measures have also been submitted to the Ministry for approval and have been ordered to be followed by the exchange and all brokers. The full text of these rules and measures is as follows:

### Japanese Military's Combat Method is to Decimate Enemy Forces: Minister Matsushima Discusses the Battle of Luzon

Colonel Matsushima, the Japanese Naval Attaché to China, recently gave a speech on the war situation, after observing the battle since the enemy US forces invaded Luzon. He pointed out the failure of the enemy's strategy, and stated that the future decisive battle will determine the rise and fall of East Asia. Therefore, the one billion people of East Asia should unite and advance together. The main points of his speech are as follows:

Five weeks have passed since the enemy US forces began landing in Lingayen Gulf. The enemy's achievements have been limited to dividing the Luzon plain and reaching Manila, a cultural city with no strategic value. They have achieved nothing in terms of decimating the opposing forces. The Japanese army in Luzon is still able to secure strategic locations, and its core troops have not suffered any losses. Therefore, the result of the US military's five weeks of hard fighting is merely a success on the map. In short, there is little value in vying for territory. Only General Yamashita's combat guidance can give us limitless expectations.

The Enemy is Attempting a Last-Ditch Effort

Furthermore, MacArthur has transferred most of his forces to the Luzon area, and is gathering a large army in the Mariana Islands to actively reinforce them. The enemy's aggressive attack on the Philippines is nothing more than a last-ditch effort to penetrate the Japanese line. There are three possibilities for this: first, to invade the Japanese mainland; second, to land on the mainland; and third, to land on the peninsula in Southeast Asia. The enemy hopes to land on the Japanese mainland, but they will encounter strong resistance. The third point, regarding landing on the peninsula in Southeast Asia, i.e., landing in the area from Vietnam to Malaya, to support the anti-Axis forces in Burma, has very little strategic effect. Therefore, the enemy's attempt to land on the Chinese mainland has long been planned, but it will not succeed easily. Even if the enemy has not achieved significant results in the Philippines, they will not succeed in invading the Chinese mainland, which is heavily defended by the China Expeditionary Army and the China Fleet. The enemy will suffer greater losses in the future, and Japan's combat guidance focuses on decimating enemy forces. We, the one billion people of East Asia, should rise up and wash away the humiliation of the past century.

### The Truth of the Enemy's False Propaganda is Gradually Exposed: The Outrageous Illegal Acts of the US Military

It has been learned from well-informed sources that since the beginning of the war in the Philippines, the United States has frequently used its cunning and false propaganda tactics, claiming to be aiming for national liberation, and making various inducements to the people of the Philippines. They have also publicized: "When the US military entered Luzon, the Philippine people welcomed them with open arms. Especially when landing in Subic Bay, the Philippine people raised the American Star-Spangled Banner to show their welcome, so the landing fleet did not fire a shot. Philippine guerrilla teams are also quite active in various parts of the Philippines." In fact, the enemy US forces are finding the war in the Philippines increasingly difficult, and the cooperation of the Philippine people has not met the enemy US forces' expectations. MacArthur also said: "The Philippine people are helping the United States, but some are also cooperating with Japan. Therefore, the power of the Philippine people's cooperation is common to both Japan and the United States. Therefore, we should not easily trust the welcoming attitude of the Philippine people." We can also learn from another piece of propaganda that they have turned their attention to the local overseas Chinese: "Local overseas Chinese are cooperating in guerrilla warfare, especially the arson in Manila, which was done by the overseas Chinese." However, the enemy US forces previously said that the arson in Manila was done by the Japanese army themselves. A comparison shows the contradiction, and the absurdity of the enemy US propaganda is gradually exposed here.

If the enemy US forces had ideal and good policy guidance in their occupied territories, the unprecedented tragedies in the countries of France and Italy would not have occurred. Taking the cruel situation in Italy after being ravaged by the US military as an example, the people have become beggars and thieves, and prostitutes are everywhere. The mortality rate of infants under one year old is particularly high. The miserable situation of people not being able to make a living and waiting to die should also serve as a warning to those who are immersed in the enemy US propaganda. The contrast between the enemy US propaganda and the reality can be seen from this.

On the 4th of this month, US troops stationed in Chongqing and Rong committed atrocities against respectable women and hostess singers, engaging in rape, plunder, and all kinds of evil deeds. What's more, US troops forcibly abducted women into their cars and gang-raped them to death. US troops on the streets wantonly molested women passing by. All these things make the local people furious. Wu Guozhen, the Foreign Minister of Chongqing, has lodged a serious protest with the United States, but the United States has perfunctorily ignored it. On the one hand, we can attribute this inhumane behavior of the US military to racial discrimination. On the other hand, it can also be seen as a manifestation of the traditional psychological contempt for East Asians, especially the Chinese. Recently, some people in Shanghai still have doubts about the war situation and whether the United States can bring happiness. This concept should be eliminated urgently, and we should strengthen our belief in victory, refuse the landing of the US and British forces on the Chinese mainland, boost our spirits, and fight for the liberation of East Asia.
