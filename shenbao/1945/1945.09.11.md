### Most Japanese Textile Factories to be Transferred to China, Temporary Disposal Plan Decided

Central News Agency, New York, 8th Dispatch – A temporary plan for the disposal of the Japanese textile industry has been decided. According to the established policy, the Japanese textile industry will manufacture goods for a certain period to meet the relief needs in the Far East. Afterwards, most Japanese textile factories will be transferred to China as part of the reparations. The transferred Japanese textile factories will increase China's cotton planting production to 600 million yards. China's current productivity is approximately 400 million yards. China's rayon production will soon be able to compete with the United Kingdom for the leading position as the largest manufacturer of rayon. According to the plan, Japanese textile production will be greatly reduced, with only 100 million yards of cotton cloth and 35 million yards of rayon produced to meet the urgent textile needs of various countries and territories in the Far East. Once the Far East's needs are met, China will receive most of Japan's textile factories. Only 40% of the cotton weaving factory and 20% of the rayon production capacity will be used for the needs of Japan itself. In this way, before 1949, Japan will fall from the second largest textile exporting country to a consumer country.
