This parliament was convened under frequent enemy air raids and during the most critical period of the so-called enemy invasion of the Philippines.

The House of Peers also passed a resolution to complete the war at its plenary session on the 2nd, urging the government to implement strong measures.

### Industry Re-Allocation Among China, Japan, and Manchukuo: Talk by Manchukuo State Minister

Xinjing, 13th (Central News Agency dispatch) - Manchukuo State Minister, Mr. Takebe, stated on the 12th as follows: The issue of industry re-allocation among China, Japan, and Manchukuo is based on a higher comprehensive perspective. Therefore, Manchukuo's war effort enhancement strategy is also based on this. In other words, to complete the war, it is necessary to increase the production of raw materials and decisive weapons such as aircraft, as this is the only way to strengthen the primary war effort. To realize the new ideal, there are plans to construct a machinery factory and relocate Japanese factories. Regarding this point, the Japanese government has also declared that it will actively provide assistance and is currently urgently promoting this. However, the foundation for this primary line of war effort enhancement must also be built upon existing industries such as iron, aluminum, coal, timber, and alcohol. Therefore, it is even more necessary to expand the basic industries, and as a result, Manchukuo's responsibility is becoming increasingly important.

### The First Thing in the New Year

Yesterday, we discussed how everyone should live frugally during the Spring Festival period. Our intention was to point out that we are currently in a decisive era of national war. While the front lines are shedding blood, the rear should naturally practice wartime living. This should be the case not only in terms of obligation but also in terms of emotion. Time flies, and the Spring Festival period will soon be over. After the Spring Festival, we believe that the first thing that should be done is population evacuation.

Why should we evacuate? We have said it repeatedly. How should we evacuate? The municipal authorities are currently preparing to study this. At the same time, they are establishing close contact with the transportation authorities and relevant parties. In that case, the implementation of evacuation will begin soon, and there is no question about it. First, we hope that all charitable organizations, such as those caring for infants, orphans, and the elderly, will prepare for evacuation as soon as possible. It is better to be proactive than reactive. At the same time, we hope that all citizens will take advantage of this passing Spring Festival period to fully consider the issue of evacuation based on their own circumstances. For example:

(1) Those who have a fixed occupation in Shanghai but have a large family should prepare to evacuate the elderly, weak, women, and children in their family first. If they have houses and land in their hometown that they leased out because their entire family was in Shanghai, they should negotiate to reclaim them for use upon returning home. If the houses and land in their hometown are damaged or neglected, they should repair and renovate them.

(2) Those who do not have a fixed occupation in Shanghai and have previously relied on hoarding goods for profit or speculative trading mostly came to Shanghai to escape the war in their hometown. Therefore, they were mostly property owners in their hometown, and there will be absolutely no problem with their livelihood upon returning home.

In short, prices in Shanghai are higher than in the countryside, and the danger of air raids is also greater than in the countryside. For the sake of their own safety, anyone who does not need to live in Shanghai should evacuate and return home. On the other hand, the government should, of course, be responsible for ensuring the security situation in various places.

The battles in Lower Silesia are particularly fierce. There is also fierce fighting in the areas south of Brieg, Preis, and Järisch-Wüstegiersdorf. Konev's plan is to encircle Breslau and isolate it.

### Three-Power Conference Concludes: Communiqué Issued

Lisbon, 13th (Central News Agency dispatch) - The meeting of the heads of state of Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union, held in Yalta, Crimea, since February 4th, has concluded. A joint communiqué has been issued, with the main points as follows: (1) Regarding the war against Germany, the heads of state of the three countries considered and decided on a joint war plan against the common enemy. The military representatives of the three countries have held daily talks and have drafted a detailed plan regarding the timing, scope, and coordination of new offensives from the east, west, north, and south into the heart of Germany. Military talks between the three countries will be held at any time in the future as necessary. (2) A consensus has been reached regarding policies and plans for Germany to fulfill the terms of unconditional surrender to the Allied nations. Regarding Germany's payment of reparations for losses to the Allied nations, a special committee will be established in Moscow to determine the scope of reparations in kind. (3) Regarding an international security system, in order to abolish the political and economic causes of war, based on close cooperation among the United Nations, the informal proposals of the Dumbarton Oaks Conference will be reviewed. A United Nations conference will be held in San Francisco on April 25th. Before extending invitations to participate, consultations will first be held with the Chongqing regime and the de Gaulle government, and then the five powers will invite Allied groups to attend the conference. Although a consensus was not reached at the Dumbarton Oaks Conference regarding the voting procedures for sanctioning aggressor nations, it is believed that these difficulties can be overcome at this conference. Regarding policies towards "liberated" nations, the heads of state of the three countries have signed a declaration, the main significance of which is based on the principles of democracy.

### Municipal Finance Bureau Announces: Procedures for Tax Exemption for Charity Performances: Points to Note in the Application Procedures

The Municipal Finance Bureau states that various charitable organizations and schools in the city have requested the Finance Bureau to exempt them from entertainment taxes for charity performances held to raise funds or for public welfare projects, but they have not followed the procedures. The Finance Bureau has now decided to handle this strictly.

### Money Shops in the City: Changing Loan Methods: Considerable Business Surplus Last Year

Under the guidance of the Central Reserve Bank and the supervision of the Money Shops Guild, the business of various money shops in the city is progressing day by day, and the foundation is becoming more and more solid. Last year (1944), each shop operated in an orderly manner. The loans of various banks have traditionally been based on current account overdrafts. Most of those who opened current accounts were factories and businesses in the industrial and commercial sectors, and the banks were well aware of their credit status. They usually accept deposits and provide them with financing facilities when necessary. Moreover, because the industrial and commercial sectors are different, the days when one sector has excess funds are precisely the times when another sector needs funds. Banks, situated in the middle, act as a hub for turnover and can operate freely. However, in the previous year (1943), when various banks closed their current account overdrafts at the end of the year, customers arbitrarily defaulted and did not repay them. In order to maintain the turnover of funds and avoid losses of principal and interest, special changes were made. Since last year, in addition to fixed-term loans, loan business has mostly been changed from current account overdrafts to bill discounting. If a customer applies for a loan, they sign a contract with the bill and provide collateral. The loan term is shortened to one week or half a month, with the maximum term being one month. The implementation has been quite effective, and the scope of loans has also been restricted. The loan interest rate has been gradually increased based on the price situation. After the operations of various banks gradually improved, the business surplus for last year was quite good.
