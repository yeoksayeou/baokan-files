### Fierce Attack by Elite Japanese Troops; Enemy on Luzon Island Suffers Heavy Losses; Japanese Forces Launch Mobile Warfare on the Mingan Front

Philippine Front, 1st (Central News Agency dispatch) - Three divisions of enemy troops on Luzon Island marched directly south towards Manila, operating along the Lingayen coast. Elite Japanese troops launched a fierce attack, and Japanese forces in the plains around Manila responded in coordination, severely attacking the southward-moving enemy. East of Tarlac, on the 27th, several raiding units under the command of Lieutenant General Yamamoto, miraculously struck an enemy ammunition depot line, capturing fifty boxes of jet-propelled shells. An engineering unit under the command of Sato exploded 250 landmines against enemy troops attacking on the 27th. The enemy panicked and fled, suffering heavy casualties. A large amount of enemy supplies and ammunition were also captured. The enemy troops, severely battered by the Japanese attack, hastily dispatched many sentries to various units heading south, changed the positions of their tanks, and took immediate evasive action. Since landing, the enemy forces near the Lingayen coast have suffered over 7,000 casualties and had over 70 tanks destroyed. It is currently determined that the raiding units alone inflicted 800 casualties and destroyed 60 tanks.

Philippine Island Base, 1st (Central News Agency dispatch) - Enemy forces in the east of Lingayen, with a main force of approximately four divisions, launched repeated attacks. They were met with ambushes by Japanese frontline units and raids by suicide squads, suffering significant losses. Up to the 31st, Japanese raiding units have killed approximately 10,000 enemy troops, equivalent to about one division's strength.

Philippine Front Base, 1st (Central News Agency dispatch) - Enemy forces, anxious to advance southward, used a portion of their strong units on the 30th, from an area about 70 kilometers from Manila, to invade San Fernando on the Bataan Peninsula. Another unit advanced south along the Rosario-Guimba road, gradually increasing their forces on the Mingan front. The Japanese forces, in response, not only launched mobile warfare but also conducted daring raids everywhere, deploying tanks to fiercely attack the arrogant enemy. Around noon on the 29th, approximately 300 enemy troops, equipped with ten tanks and several mortars, attacked the southwest area of Mingan. The Japanese forces launched a fierce counterattack with numerous raiding units, inflicting heavy losses. In the Mu√±oz area, approximately 200 enemy troops who attacked twice were completely repelled, shattering the enemy's ambitions in that area.

Philippine Base, 1st (Central News Agency dispatch) - On the evening of the 29th, Japanese air units attacked enemy small boats near the coast of Gumaca, sinking several of them.

### National Mobilization Plan Underway; Director of Military Affairs Bureau Nasu Answers Questions

Tokyo, 1st (Central News Agency dispatch) - Director Nasu of the Army Ministry's Military Affairs Bureau, in response to questions from Mr. Uematsu Renma at the House of Representatives' Military Service Law Committee yesterday afternoon, stated the following: According to recent intelligence, the United States, which had temporarily reduced its military mobilization plan, seems to have re-entered a state of increase. The difficulties faced by Britain in its military mobilization or general mobilization plans are well known to the entire nation. In comparison, Japan's military mobilization situation has more leeway than other belligerent nations. However, in terms of production facilities, machinery, and technical support, Japan's total mobilization personnel, compared to the United States and others, seems to require manpower in certain areas. Its situation is completely different from that of the enemy. Therefore, to complete the military mobilization forces for the ongoing war, we have fully communicated with all relevant parties. Except for the extraction of personnel for military mobilization, there are no obstacles to the general mobilization plan, which is currently underway.

### Australian Army Chief Praises Japanese Military Spirit

Lisbon, 1st (Central News Agency dispatch) - According to a Canberra dispatch, Australian Army Chief Ford, on the 30th, broadcasted to the American people about the fierce fighting spirit of the Japanese forces in the Southwest Pacific, stating: Since the start of the war, the Australian army, having deployed its largest forces to areas under MacArthur's command, and fought against well-equipped Japanese troops in New Guinea and other Southwest Pacific islands, has deeply recognized their intense fighting spirit and disregard for life. Therefore, the wars on those islands cannot be considered mere mopping-up operations. Even after the arrival of American forces, and although the Philippine islands have been brought into the hands of the Australian army, the Japanese resistance remains extremely strong. Therefore, it is necessary to increase the strength of the Australian army.

### Palembang Residents Assist in Combat

Palembang, 1st (Central News Agency dispatch) - On the 29th, around 10:00 AM, approximately 110 enemy carrier-based aircraft attacked the Palembang area. The local Japanese forces fiercely engaged them, shooting down or destroying about 90 aircraft. The enemy aircraft, unable to drop their bombs, fled in haste. The wreckage of the enemy aircraft was scattered throughout the city and the humid forests in the suburbs. The resulting fires were quickly extinguished by local residents and Japanese forces. The young volunteer corps in the area fought shoulder-to-shoulder with the Japanese forces at the airfield and in the military, demonstrating unimaginable bravery. Although they were injured when enemy aircraft attacked on the 29th, they continued to transport supplies and fire weapons. According to a certain unit commander, the local people are now resolutely participating in the Japanese war effort, displaying a spirit of self-sacrifice that is truly astonishing.

### Japanese Forces in South China Occupy Fuguo Coal Mine; All Mine Facilities Become Japanese Property

South China Front, 1st (Central News Agency dispatch) - The raiding units of the Japanese forces occupying Shaoguan continued their advance north along the right side of the Beijiang River. On the afternoon of the 27th, they occupied the Fuguo Coal Mine, approximately 16 kilometers north of Shaoguan. Because of the rapid Japanese advance, the Chongqing forces were unable to destroy the coal and iron mine in time. Therefore, all the mine's light railways, power plants, water supply facilities, and earthwork factories and repair shops were seized by the Japanese forces.

### Completion of Air Defense-in-Depth Positions

Certain Base in China, 1st (Central News Agency dispatch) - From the perspective of air strategy, the current Japanese operation to open the Yuehan Railway and the South China coast has great significance. The air force generally decides the outcome of a war before naval battles. Securing air superiority over the theater of war and deploying air bases are key factors. However, while the enemy attempts to maintain continuity on the Chinese mainland, the first-line bases of Chongqing's remaining troops east of the Yuehan Line are naturally extremely disadvantageous to the Japanese air defense war. Therefore, the Japanese forces have decided to launch a coastal offensive to thoroughly eliminate them. Among Chongqing's coastal bases, other than Xincheng and other places in Fujian Province, which have been successively destroyed, only Suichuan, Ganzhou, and Nanxiong in northern Guangdong remain. With the cooperation of the north and south armies advancing rapidly, Suichuan has already been occupied. Currently, from the perspective of these bases occupied by the Japanese forces, they have become Japanese bases and are connected to the Guilin-Liuzhou line. In the vast area extending approximately 1,000 kilometers east to the coastline, more than 15 occupied bases have been established. As a result, a powerful Japanese air defense-in-depth position has been formed. Moreover, in this vast area traversing South China, there is no longer any space for Chongqing-American forces to use as temporary airfields. The Japanese aviation bombing posture in China and the consolidation of forces at each base are now as solid as a rock.

### Opening of the Southern Section of the Yuehan Railway Has Great Strategic Significance; Japanese Press Department Provides Detailed Explanation

Nanjing, 1st (Central News Agency dispatch) - At 4:00 PM on the 1st, the Japanese Press Department met with a group of Chinese reporters at the Japan Press Club in the Fuchang Hotel, providing a detailed explanation of the opening of the southern section of the Yuehan Railway and its important strategic significance. The main points are as follows:

In the southern region of the Yuehan Railway, the Japanese forces, starting on January 1st of this year, launched a pincer attack from the north and south toward the northern area. They divided into two routes: one advanced west from Daoxian and Lingling, flanking the Yuehan Railway, and the other advanced directly north along the Yuehan Railway from Leiyang toward the front of Lechang. On the same day, the Japanese forces in South China also advanced north along the Yuehan Railway in two routes: one advanced from Sihui toward Qingyuan, and the other advanced along the east side of the Yuehan Railway from Huaxian, directly approaching Shaoguan. On January 27th, the two armies joined forces north of Shaoguan, completing the opening of the Yuehan Railway. The most noteworthy aspect of this battle was the preservation of the bridges and tunnels between Lechang and Baishi. There are numerous tunnels and bridges at the intersection of Hunan and Guangdong, and the construction is dangerous. Once damaged, restoration would be extremely difficult. Therefore, in order to thoroughly ensure that the tunnels and bridges in that area suffered no damage, the Japanese forces selected elite soldiers from the army on January 8th to form a suicide squad, which launched a surprise attack. Because the Chongqing army's combat power was weak and its morale was low, it offered no resistance in this battle and mostly retreated into the mountains on both sides of the railway. In coordination with the southern Yuehan Railway battle, another route of the Japanese forces, from the Xianggan border near Yunhua, occupied Suichuan and is continuing to pursue the remaining Chongqing troops toward Ganzhou. It should be noted that Suichuan and Ganzhou are bases for the southeast frontline fighter squadrons of the Chongqing-based American air force. Enemy fighter squadrons that have been harassing the Jinghu (Nanjing-Shanghai) and South China areas have been operating from here. Therefore, the Central China region will no longer be disturbed by enemy aircraft. The strategic value of opening the southern section of the Yuehan Railway has the following three points: (1) the destruction of Chongqing's Seventh War Zone; (2) the isolation of Chongqing's Fourth, Seventh, and Third War Zones; (3) the Japanese forces' mobility on the mainland front will be greatly enhanced.

### Defense Strengthened after Connecting the Yuehan Railway

Tokyo, 1st (Central News Agency dispatch) - After the Japanese forces joined forces at Suilu, connecting the mainland battle line, the American-Chongqing forces became even more anxious and launched aggressive operations in the Pacific. Afterwards, they landed in Leyte Gulf and Mindoro Island, and recently they have shown a tendency to seize Luzon Island and land on the coast of mainland China. The Japanese forces will inflict a fatal blow on the American-Chongqing actions. Significant results have already been achieved in the Philippines, and the intrusion of Japanese forces into Guizhou on the mainland battle line has forced the Chongqing forces to move inland, demonstrating the strength of the Japanese forces. In order to further consolidate the mainland defense line, the Japanese forces in Central and South China began a fierce attack on the Yuehan Railway from Leiyang to Yingtak's southern Yuantanxu, an area of more than a thousand miles, on the 9th of this month, and on the 24th, they occupied Shaoguan, the headquarters of Chongqing's Seventh War Zone. The Chongqing troops are currently collapsing to the northwest. Another unit of Japanese forces simultaneously occupied Suichuan Airfield. By this point, the Yuehan Railway was completely under Japanese control. The Japanese forces' connection of the Yuehan Railway this time is even more beneficial to future operations on the mainland, because it not only serves to aid the unified battle line on the mainland, but also directly makes the defense, transportation, and mobilization capabilities on the South China coastline more flexible, enabling them to adequately respond to American-Chongqing attempts to land. The Chongqing troops made an active attempt to counterattack. They concentrated forces in Guiyang and deployed eleven divisions of troops in Xintian, Guiyang, Qiwu area on the Hunan-Guangdong border, in an attempt to stir up trouble and actively hinder the Japanese forces. Fortunately, after the Japanese forces connected the Yuehan Railway, they completely crushed that counterattack attempt and made it even more difficult for the remaining forces of Chongqing's Third, Ninth, and Seventh War Zones to gather and respond. Furthermore, due to the occupation of Suichuan Airport, the guerrilla warfare capabilities of the Chongqing-American air force have been reduced. From now on, Chongqing's so-called counterattack will come to an end. After this setback, the anxiety and attempts of the American-Chongqing forces will become more active, because the American military intends to defeat the Japanese forces and launch a fierce land and sea battle. On the mainland, they naturally rely heavily on the Chongqing army, but the Chongqing army has failed, giving the American-Chongqing strategy a major shock. In order to respond to the mainland operations, they have no choice but to try to rapidly realize their desire to land. However, the Japanese forces have already prepared for this and stationed troops in the Huizhou area, forming an extremely strong defense along the entire South China coast. Once the American army invades, it will inevitably be met with a fierce Japanese counterattack. At the same time, if the enemy rashly attacks, it will be a major taboo to penetrate deep, because Luzon Island is still in fierce battles, and enemy aircraft invading the mainland will be intercepted by the Japanese forces. Therefore, after the Japanese forces connected the Yuehan Railway, they provided the Japanese forces with a favorable opportunity to annihilate the enemy in a responsive landing battle that was driven by anxiety.

### After Reading the Nelson-Halleck Report

‚Äî Wan Xibai

Recently, the United States has successively released "Reports on China." These include the U.S. Wartime Information Bureau's "Official Report on China," Roosevelt's envoy Mansfield's report to Congress on the situation in China, and the reports of War Production Board Director Nelson and Major General Halleck, who were specially sent to China last August to rebuild China's wartime economy. Among these, the Nelson-Halleck report, in addition to outlining their work process, frankly states the future value of China for exploitation by American imperialism, which is quite interesting. Moreover, this report has been reviewed by Roosevelt, and the part that Roosevelt himself considered appropriate to publish has recently been released. The purposes of the above three reports differ, and their modes of expression are also different. There are also many contradictions among them, but their common thread is the blatant expression of the ambition to completely subordinate China to the United States in order to carry out the war against Japan and strengthen American imperialism. In particular, the Nelson-Halleck report reveals this ambition fully and concretely, even in the section describing China's economic construction. It is feared that the part that Roosevelt dared not publish contains wishful thinking that would further displease Chongqing.

The published portion of the report details the establishment of the War Production Board in Chongqing and the expectations of the United States. Among these, the "expectations of the United States" are specifically stated as follows:

"American production technicians have begun working in China. When I returned from China in November, I agreed with the Foreign Economic Administration that I would bring six production technicians, five of whom are steelmaking experts and one of whom is an alcohol manufacturing expert. These outstanding experts will immediately visit Chinese factories to study their production methods. They will assist Chinese business operators and government officials for more than three months in order to increase production, improve quality, and reduce production costs. The main purpose is to increase the direct production of certain military supplies needed by the Chinese army."

In the current stage of the war, starting to build a steel industry based on scarce iron ore resources is truly fitting of the saying "rushing to meet a slow doctor." Chongqing's Commercial Daily recently criticized the War Production Board, saying:

"Since the establishment of the War Production Board and the appointment of Weng Wenhao as director, considerable time has passed, but the concrete and fundamental guidelines for increasing production have yet to be determined, causing producers to feel disappointed. The Production Board has not only failed to assist producers, but it has also not held a single meeting to date."

This is indeed the truth - in fact, one could understand this from the very beginning. Why do I say this? Because Nelson's plan is undoubtedly focused on the post-war period, just as the Christian Science Monitor pointed out, and did not consider immediately making "China a large arsenal for freedom-loving nations" or similar things. The War Production Board was fundamentally established as a cornerstone for the United States to completely colonize China. The task that the United States intends to impose on Chongqing in carrying out the war against Japan is nothing more than the arbitrary use of China's vast human resources and its geographical conditions as a base for attacks against Japan. The United States' eagerness to mediate cooperation between Chongqing and the Communists also stems from this. As for the establishment of the War Production Board, its main expected effect at present is to boost the morale of the people of Chongqing. Regarding this point, Nelson states as follows:

"The establishment of the Chinese War Production Board and the arrival of technical delegates has had a direct effect on the Chinese people's will to fight."

In other words, no matter how much fanfare the propaganda makes, the contribution of Chongqing's War Production Board to the war of resistance, from an economic point of view, is simply negligible. This point has also been admitted by the Nelson-Halleck report itself. In short, it is not a "wartime" production board at all, but at most a "post-war" production board.

The Nelson-Halleck report concludes by saying:

If the attempt to promote China's planned wartime production succeeds, the economic relationship between China and the United States will become closer after the war. China has the possibility and hope of developing its domestic industries with the help of the United States.

"If such assistance is realistic, it must be built on a sound commercial basis. After the war, China will replace Japan as the leading industrial nation in the Far East. At that time, a large-scale market will be progressively opened up for American export industries."

This is indeed a straightforward conclusion and a far-reaching plan! Halleck in politics and Wedemeyer in military affairs have been working hard to subordinate Chongqing completely to the United States, while Nelson grasps it in economics, thereby laying the foundation for political and military subordination to the United States. If his plan succeeds, then post-war China will be completely transformed into an American colony. At that time, not only the vast population of China, but even the various peoples of the entire Far East, will become the targets of the harsh exploitation of gold-dollar capital. And American commerce will obtain unlimited profits from the "progressively opened" Far Eastern market at its monopolistic prices. However, this is of course just a one-sided "ambition" of Wall Street, a more fitting pipe dream. The Nelson-Halleck report has automatically and blatantly exposed this kind of ambition and dream. This is good propaganda material for Japan, which is fighting for the liberation of the East Asian peoples, and also realistically exposes the hideous face of the United States towards Chongqing and the various peoples of East Asia. In this sense, we express our deep gratitude to Roosevelt for publicly releasing this report!

Editorial

### Strengthening Trade Associations

Shanghai's industrial and commercial organizations, known as trade associations, have a long history. Since the National Government formulated the "Provisional Regulations for Industrial and Commercial Trade Associations" in March of the 32nd year of the Republic (1943), various industries have reorganized their associations. Currently, there are over 200 trade associations established with the approval of the Bureau of Economic Affairs. These associations naturally hold extremely important positions within Shanghai's economic organization.

According to Article 2 of the Provisional Regulations, the task of trade associations is clearly defined as: "Industrial and commercial trade associations are established to assist the government in implementing economic policies and to enhance the common interests of the industry." In normal times, they assist the government in implementing economic measures; in wartime, they should especially take on the task of promoting wartime economic policies. In terms of wartime economic tasks, they are doubly important compared to peacetime. This is because modern warfare is a total war competition, and the economy is an important sector in the total war. In principle, it is necessary to ensure that the people have a minimum level of stable economic life before contributing all economic power to enrich war resources. Therefore, industry and commerce should each fulfill their tasks based on their respective positions in the economic sector. Trade associations are organizations that unite various industries, so as to generate collective power and accomplish a common mission.

With the establishment of the National General Association of Commercial Control, the collective self-governance nature of commerce began to implement a controlled economy. Its grassroots organization is also the trade association, and therefore the task of the trade association is even more important. To fulfill their responsibilities for wartime and controlled economies, strengthening their organization and work is even more necessary. However, the reorganization of various industry associations in this city has been ongoing for two years. From an objective review, we believe that they have not achieved the expected results. We would like to offer the following suggestions for future improvements:

(1) Strengthen trade association organizations and merge trade associations of similar nature. Industrial classifications need not be too detailed; they should be simplified as much as possible. This is because if there are not many businesses in a specific industry, forming separate associations will only disperse power and increase expenses.

(2) Although trade association leaders are elected, they must be reviewed by the relevant authorities to prevent unscrupulous elements from exploiting and controlling the association. The primary condition should be that they are trusted by the people in the industry. After assuming a position in the association, it should be regarded as actual work, aiming to seek benefits for the industry.

(3) Trade associations should regularly supervise the business policies of their members. If hoarding or profiteering is discovered, it should be corrected immediately. Only those within the industry are most aware of industry trends.

(4) The relevant authorities should pay close attention to the dynamics of trade associations, establishing contact with the leaders of various trade associations at all times to announce government policies, and also to supervise active work to prevent the formation of idle groups.

(5) Any price increases in various industries must be justified by the trade association and submitted to the relevant authorities for approval. Arbitrary or individual price increases are not allowed.

(6) After the trade association organization is sound, it can generate collective power. When members have requests or encounter difficulties, they can appeal to the relevant authorities according to law, which will naturally be valued by the authorities.

(7) Trade associations are by no means profit-sharing groups. The interests of the industry are their own interests. They must never exploit the interests of members or impose excessive demands on them under false pretenses.

In short, strengthening trade associations has a great effect on suppressing prices and preventing hoarding, which benefits the wartime and controlled economies. This need not be reiterated. Now that the city's economic authorities are working to refresh economic administration, it is an important task worth promoting. Attention should be paid to it.

### City Finance Bureau Implements Organizational Adjustments, Further Enhancing the Efficiency of City Finances

Since Secretary-General Luo took office, the Municipal Finance Bureau has spared no effort in adjusting municipal finances. Recently, it has again reformed its internal organization, adding a Business Tax Section, a Special Consumption Tax Section, a Property and Land Tax Section, an Accounting Section, a Treasury Section, and an Inspection Section, starting yesterday. The original Special Consumption Tax Office was deemed too large, so it was abolished. At the same time, in order to prevent malfeasance, such as corruption by tax collectors and tax evasion by merchants, a Inspection Section was added. It is expected that the efficiency of municipal finances will be further enhanced in the future. The Central News Agency reporter has investigated the internal work of the main sections of the Finance Bureau, as follows:

Adjustment of Internal Organization and Structure

(1) The Business Tax Section has already started collecting the Business Tax for the spring season of this year in the old 1st and 2nd districts on February 1st. (2) The abolition of the Special Consumption Tax Office and the establishment of the Special Consumption Tax Section has also begun. (3) The former Property Tax and Land Tax Sections are now combined into a single Property and Land Tax Section, starting today, for easier unified management. (4) The original Collection and Investigation Section has been abolished, and its work will now be handled by the various responsible sections. (5) The abolition of the Municipal General Accounting Office, with the Finance Bureau establishing a dedicated Accounting Section. (6) The unification and merger of the old 1st and 2nd district treasuries and the Municipal Treasury into a single Treasury, with the Finance Bureau establishing a Treasury Section, which was formally established yesterday. (7) The new Inspection Section is responsible for: (A) Investigating and reporting merchants evading orÊºèÁ®éÊºèÁ®Ö. (B) Adjusting and reporting illegal activities of financial administrative tax personnel. In order to ensure meticulous internal organization, fewer personnel are hired, but with greater authority, to facilitate their reporting and adjustment tasks. All personnel recruited for the Inspection Section are rigorously selected and sworn to be loyal to their service. If any personnel in the Inspection Section themselves engage in corruption, they will be severely punished.

Director-General Luo Delivers Instructions

The Municipal Finance Bureau held a bureau affairs meeting yesterday (1st) morning at 11:00 AM, presided over by Director-General Luo himself. All section heads and assistants and above participated. Director-General Luo delivered instructions on the spot, providing many valuable guidelines on the reform plan for finance, and reported on the adjustment of the financial organization. Director-General Luo's instructions were as follows: (1) I come from a staff background and understand the situation of staff members, and the necessary conditions for their work: First, be loyal to your superiors; second, have meticulous planning and careful thinking, and share the worries of your superiors. I am both the Chief of Staff of the Municipal Government and a "responsible person". I am determined to work with the spirit of "going to hell", regardless of new or old, thinking about things. This time, in order to adapt to the organization, there have been personnel adjustments. I hope that everyone can work together with a fighting spirit. (2) The place where we are now working was left behind by Anglo-American imperialism. Recalling the humiliation we have suffered for more than a hundred years, we should strive to correct the habits of following old ways and eliminate past malpractices to comfort our ancestors. (3) The Municipal Government's finances must take the initiative to adapt. The implementation of wartime municipal administration requires huge project funds, and the increase in the salaries of general service personnel also requires considerable funding. The Finance Bureau is responsible for planning, and there are two methods: First, rectify old taxes, in addition to eliminating corruption, strictly crack down on tax evasion; second, open up new taxes, such as the Business Tax in the former first and eighth districts, etc., which should have been implemented but were not. The rest is to increase tax rates, such as the Special Tax on Goods Sold Separately, which has been increased from 4% to 5% starting today (1st), and so on. There were many words of encouragement, ending with: "I deeply believe that if we can mobilize" all personnel, we will definitely achieve considerable results."

Spring Business Tax to Be Collected Starting Today

In addition to the ordinary special consumption tax, various tax revenues of the Municipal Finance Bureau have been increased from 4% to 5% starting today. The Spring Business Tax for the old first and eighth districts will begin collection on February 1st. In order to handle the collection of the Business Tax, the Finance Bureau has newly established a Business Tax Section. The recruitment of collectors will be done in an open manner, selecting and employing suitable talents to serve in the old first and eighth districts.

The municipal authorities stipulated yesterday (1st) that a special consumption tax fee standard will be collected for the city's Jai Alai stadium and dog racing track, stipulating that 20% of the face value of the tickets will be collected. However, this special consumption tax is only for general Chinese tourists, and it is heard that the authorities will take decisive measures against those who refuse to comply.

### Su, Director of the Rural Clearing Affairs Bureau, Took Office Yesterday

The newly appointed Director of the Municipal Rural Clearing Affairs Bureau, Mr. Su Chengde, officially went to the bureau yesterday (1st) to take office. The new Director Su and his entourage arrived at the bureau at 9:00 AM. The former concurrent Director Xiong had arrived at the bureau to lead senior staff in welcoming him into the director's office to handle the handover of the new and the old. The Municipal Government specially sent Secretary Zheng Panpan to preside over the inauguration ceremony. After 10:00 AM, the heads of various agencies in the city and guests from all walks of life came to congratulate him, with no less than 200 people. Director Su received them with tea and refreshments in the conference room. At 11:45 AM, Director Su specially summoned all personnel in the bureau to speak in the conference room, with many words of encouragement. At noon, he met with reporters and delivered an inaugural speech. The details are as follows:

Inaugural Speech

After taking office, Director Su spoke to all personnel in the bureau as follows: "I have been ordered to be transferred to serve as the Director of the Municipal Rural Clearing Affairs Bureau. I am very happy to meet you all for the first time today. In the past, most of my work has been in the nature of police work, previously in the capital and recently in this city. Now the Mayor wants me to take on the clearing work in the districts of this city. My personal ability is limited, and I am afraid that I will not be able to fulfill the task. However, I think that the police are to maintain public order, and the purpose of clearing is to seek the establishment of public order. The nature of the work is mutually linked, so I dare to boldly try to take on this arduous task.

The clearing work in this city, under the leadership of former Acting Chairman Chen, and last year with the continued implementation by the concurrent Director Xiong, has already had a very good foundation and complete regulations. Most of you have been serving here for a long time and are very experienced. I am able to be in this good environment and take on the responsibility of clearing the city with you all. I will naturally implement, develop, and promote the original plan and the existing achievements. You should also continue to help me with the spirit of past efforts. I believe that the work will definitely be satisfactory and will not disappoint the appointment of the superiors and the expectations of the local people.

Previously, the late Chairman Wang showed us that "clearing must first clear the heart." Recently, Mayor Zhou instructed when taking office: "Public interest is more important than private interest, society comes before the individual." I think that those who are responsible for clearing work should especially take the above instructions as the highest guideline for our work, and step by step with the spirit of hard work, practical work, and tough work, to build a clean government and seek happiness for the local area. I have always taken the cause as the premise, and will not make many adjustments to personnel due to the handover of new and old officials, so that work efficiency can be increased through familiarity. Therefore, I hope that you can work with peace of mind, and be more determined and more diligent to work together to promote the great cause of clearing.

Finally, regarding the treatment of colleagues, the Mayor has recently been trying to improve the salaries and rations of public officials belonging to the Municipal Government. I am determined to do my best to convey the living conditions of my colleagues in this bureau to the Changju and strive for improvement.

Today, because time is limited, there will be more opportunities to meet and talk in the future. I would like to propose the above points for your consideration.
