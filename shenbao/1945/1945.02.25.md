### Japanese Troops in Luzon Complete Initial Preparations; Implement Human Bullet Attacks, Inflicting Heavy Damage on the Enemy

Luzon Front, 24th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – Japanese forces on the Luzon front have completed their initial operations. Except for Manila and Corregidor Island, the situation is gradually becoming stagnant. The Japanese army is implementing its favored human bullet attacks to engage the enemy's artillery fire, inflicting heavy damage. There have been no major changes in the Lingayen area. Enemy motor vehicle transport in the areas of Magumin and San Jose is becoming more frequent. On the high ground south of Rosales and east of Sison, the enemy has continued to attack since dawn on the 19th. Japanese forces repelled them, firmly holding their established positions. Japanese forces also bombed and burned enemy supply depots south of San Jose; the large fire could be seen from afar. Near Nikolas, the enemy attacked the Japanese forward base with two battalions. After a counterattack by Japanese assault troops, they retreated. In the past two weeks, twenty groups of Japanese assault troops have killed or wounded 1,216 American soldiers, destroyed twelve cargo vehicles, seven heavy howitzers, nine mortars, fourteen machine guns, and seven rapid-firing guns. They also seized a considerable amount of ammunition and supplies, including four radios and automatic rifles. In the Xunban area, Japanese forces encircled the right flank of the enemy invading the northern part of the area and launched successive attacks. The Japanese artillery demonstrated its power and achieved considerable results. At the same time, the Japanese air force coordinated with the ground forces, making a surprise attack on the enemy airfield in Lingayen and the enemy supply depot in San Fabian on the night of the 20th. Three airfields were burned, and the supply depots caught fire and exploded. After completing their mission, all Japanese aircraft safely returned. The fierce fighting in the Clark area continues, with no change in the front line. The Luzon battle is now gestating the next opportunity. It remains to be seen whether the enemy will engage the Japanese army in mountain warfare or adopt a defensive strategy, which is worthy of close attention.

Luzon Front, 24th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – Corregidor Island was under heavy smoke on the 22nd due to intense enemy artillery fire and bombing. Communication has been cut off, but the Japanese garrison on the island appears to be still fighting bravely. Enemy ships have still been unable to enter Manila Bay. On the 22nd and 23rd, enemy artillery fire against the old city of Manila and the southern Japanese garrison was particularly intense. The enemy troops surrounding the Japanese army have reinforced their troops and firepower, but the Japanese soldiers are undeterred and continue to fight them in a bloody battle. The Japanese naval forces launched a heroic all-out assault operation against the enemy positions near the coast of Bacoor on the night of the 21st. A group from another naval assault team fiercely engaged the enemy near the presidential palace in hand-to-hand combat. The University of the Philippines was bombed by enemy forces on the 22nd, and the National General Hospital also fell into enemy hands on the same day. Two truckloads of young men and women in the hospital were abducted despite the families' pleas, revealing the bestial behavior of the American enemy.

### Battle for Iwo Jima Shifts to Screen Rock; Japanese Forces on Mount Suribachi Secure Positions

Tokyo, 24th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – Due to the fierce counterattacks by Japanese forces, the enemy forces advancing to the front of the Japanese positions in the Iwo Jima offensive and defensive battle have been unable to advance or retreat in the western part, Chishima village, and the central area. The enemy has been forced to retreat. Despite investing enormous manpower and equipment, the enemy continues to attack stubbornly, but the losses have increased drastically with each Japanese counterattack. On the morning of the 23rd, enemy ships around the island, while conducting intense artillery fire, also launched a land attack on the area of Screen Rock, 300 meters southeast of Motoyama Airfield. By noon, a portion of the enemy forces finally occupied Screen Rock. After reinforcing troops, the Japanese forces immediately launched a fierce attack, retaking Screen Rock by 1:30 PM. Although the enemy forces advancing on the left flank continued to attack fiercely, the Japanese army continued to secure its positions, preventing the enemy from invading, and even launched a raid into the enemy's position on the night of the 23rd. As such, the battle on the island has focused on the south side of Screen Rock. The southern part of Motoyama Airfield has been completely destroyed and turned into a wasteland because the enemy has bombarded the area with 30,000 naval artillery shells daily. In addition, the Japanese forces on Mount Suribachi continued to attack the enemy fiercely on the 22nd and 23rd, securing their main positions and engaging in fierce fighting. Since the morning of the 23rd, the waves around the island have been strong, hindering the movement of enemy ships and delaying landing operations.

Tokyo, 24th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – The Japanese garrison's artillery positions on Iwo Jima concentrated their fire on the enemy forces in the Chishima Airfield and the area south of the airfield twice on the 23rd, at 9:00 AM and around 1:00 PM. As a result, the enemy forces in that area suffered heavy casualties, and the supply warehouses in the vicinity were also destroyed by artillery fire, resulting in significant losses for the enemy.

Enemy Casualties Exceed Four Thousand

Tokyo, 24th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – Japanese forces on the Iwo Jima front continue to secure positions everywhere, and the morale of the soldiers is increasingly high, inflicting heavy damage on the enemy. According to foreign dispatches on the 22nd, the enemy announced casualties of 3,650, which increased to 4,500 by the 23rd, demonstrating the extent of their sacrifice. The enemy has landed three divisions, deploying such a large force on a coastal position of only two kilometers between the South Embankment and Chishima Village, causing them to fall into chaos after being fiercely attacked by the Japanese army. The Mount Suribachi position, which the enemy is eager to seize, remains in Japanese hands, inflicting great damage on the enemy. Every Japanese soldier, from commanders to privates, is determined to defend the position to the death. For example, Lieutenant Nakamura of the rapid-firing artillery unit single-handedly destroyed more than twenty enemy tanks, and he received commendation on the 23rd, which was reported to the Emperor, showing the bravery of all personnel. Especially on the afternoon of the 21st at 5:50 PM, more than ten large fires were seen far away on the southeastern horizon due to the suicide bombing by the Kamikaze Special Attack Team, greatly boosting morale. From the night of the 21st to dawn on the 22nd, each front line launched courageous raids against the enemy, inflicting particularly heavy damage.

Central Pacific Front, 24th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – Japanese forces in the southern part of Iwo Jima launched two raids against the enemy's southern landing points on the night of the 22nd, killing or wounding more than one hundred enemy soldiers in the first raid and more than two hundred in the second. They launched another attack on the night of the 23rd, destroying four tanks and wounding more than four hundred enemy soldiers.

### Favorable for Defense, Unfavorable for Attack; U.S. Forces Suffer Heavy Casualties

Lisbon, 24th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – According to an announcement by the Nimitz Command on the 23rd, U.S. forces have suffered a total of 5,372 casualties in the battle for Iwo Jima. The announcement stated that as of 6:00 PM on the 21st, the losses were 4,554, and have since increased by 810 in the past two days. Furthermore, United Press correspondents at the front also reported that since the start of the landing operation on the 19th, the U.S. Navy has been losing an average of three men per minute. The loss of 3,000 troops during the 72-hour battle for Tarawa Island was already considered the most intense battle in the Pacific, but judging by the battle of Iwo Jima, one can imagine the fierce and arduous fighting on the island, which is beyond the imagination of ordinary people. It is also reported that Commander Dana of the landing operation on the island lamented during a meeting with reporters that Iwo Jima is the most favorable island in the world for defense, and unfavorable for attack.

Japanese Forces Launch Hand-to-Hand Combat

Lisbon, 24th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – A United Press correspondent reported on the 23rd the battle for Mount Suribachi on Iwo Jima as follows: When approaching the Japanese positions, they were attacked by fierce artillery fire from the Japanese army, which showed the extremely high morale of the Japanese soldiers. The Japanese soldiers who were chased into caves like rats in a bag refused to surrender. At the same time, some jumped off cliffs to commit suicide, and others were forced to the top of the mountain and threw themselves into the volcanic crater, making it impossible to attack. It was also reported that the flanks of the U.S. forces attacking the central airfield were counterattacked by the Japanese army and could only advance with great difficulty. The U.S. forces on the left flank were ambushed by Japanese mortar fire twice on the 22nd, resulting in fierce hand-to-hand combat. At the same time, the right flank was also counterattacked by the Japanese army, leading to a chaotic battle. On the night of the 22nd, Japanese naval forces suddenly raided the rear of the U.S. positions on the west coast and launched courageous attacks, killing many enemy soldiers.

### Japanese Government Decides to Establish Wartime Construction Corps to Fully Utilize Domestic Construction Capacity

Tokyo, 24th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – In order to establish a wartime posture for civilian construction projects and fully utilize domestic construction capacity, the Japanese government has decided to establish a special legal entity called the Wartime Construction Corps (provisional name). The "Draft Plan for Establishing a Wartime Construction Organization" was approved by the cabinet on the 23rd. The purpose of the plan is to concentrate existing construction capacity on essential construction projects and dissolve the existing Civil Engineering and Construction Control Association. Based on Article 18 of the National General Mobilization Law, a special legal entity called the Wartime Construction Corps will be established as a simple and powerful guiding and governing agency, with regional sub-corps set up in each local administrative council district. All contracting, allocation, supervision, and promotion of projects will be entirely handled by the sub-corps.

### A Glimpse of the Fourth District of Nanhui

The Fourth District of Nanhui County is located in the northernmost part of Nanhui County and was formerly known as "Yuanbeishi." It borders the suburbs of Shanghai to the northwest, Chuansha to the east, and the Fifth District to the south. Because Nanhui County was included in the first phase of the Qingxiang movement, while Zhangjiangzhai in the Fourth District was included in the third phase, its blockade line is located on the border between the Fourth and Fifth Districts, with two major inspection stations, Yujiaqiao and Sunxiaoqiao, set up to check travelers to prevent banditry.

The entire district has fourteen townships and a population of 60,086, making it the most densely populated district after Zhoupu in the Fifth District. Most residents are engaged in agriculture, but farmers in the northwest are mainly engaged in vegetable gardening. Because the district is close to Shanghai, it is easier for residents to earn a living, and their living conditions are more prosperous than other districts. The cultural level of the residents is higher than other regions due to the presence of many schools and its proximity to Shanghai. However, due to the frequent local incidents, most of those with some education have developed outwards, making the local facilities more backward than before.

Regarding transportation in the district, rivers other than the Lujia Port and Changtang Rivers, which flow into the Bailianjing and connect to the Xiepu River, are few, narrow, and overflowing, making navigation difficult. However, the district roads are crisscrossed and paved with gravel, which is rare elsewhere. According to a resident of the district who spoke to a reporter, the Tangnan Highway (from Pudong Tangqiao to Nanhui) was built in 1937. At that time, the market was booming due to the convenience of the highway. Unfortunately, construction was halted due to the incident, and the roadbed has collapsed, making it deserted, and the situation is far from what it used to be.

Security Situation

The security situation in the district is better than other districts because it is located in the far north and close to Shanghai, making it difficult for large bands of bandits to gain a foothold. The military strength in the entire district is also strong, with the Fourth Company of the Provincial Security Training Regiment and two companies of armed police stationed there to maintain local security.

Although the security in the district is satisfactory, there are still many areas for improvement. In particular, the agencies responsible for inspecting travelers pay less attention to their responsibilities and create difficulties for goods passing through, causing much resentment among the people. It is hoped that the authorities will make improvements in the future.

Scenery of the Vegetable Market

Because the northwestern part of the Fourth District borders Shanghai, many residents are engaged in vegetable gardening. Farmers supply the Shanghai market with chives in spring, garlic in summer, vegetables in autumn, and spinach in winter, continuously throughout the year. Around 3:00 PM every day, the vegetable market is crowded with people, young and old alike. The sounds of weighing, inspecting goods, bargaining, and shouting can be heard simultaneously, and the bustling scene is impossible to describe in full detail with a pen.

Since winter began, the weather has been very cold. The vegetables planted in the fields have been repeatedly hit by cold waves, and more than half of them have been damaged by frost. Although the remaining vegetables have been carefully protected by the farmers, their number is small. In addition, there are many checkpoints for transporting goods to Shanghai, and money is required at every step. The commission is also heavy (10% of the value). Therefore, when the vegetables arrive in Shanghai and are sold to the citizens, their price has almost doubled compared to the original price. No wonder vegetable prices in Shanghai are so high.

Prosperity of Beicai

Before the incident, Beicai was a small town, and commerce was not developed. After the war shifted westward, most of the essence of the southern city was destroyed. In addition, the waterways were not open, and the entry and exit of goods were severely restricted, resulting in a surge in smuggling. Single-person merchants flocked to this place to sell daily necessities. In addition, the Shanghai market suffered from a shortage of supplies, causing panic in the market. Therefore, the rice market and salt market in the area emerged in response to the situation. According to investigations, there are more than ten black market oversight sites in the area. Rice shops are lined up side by side, and men and women carrying goods rub shoulders, resembling a grand gathering. It is reported that

There is one middle school and one primary school in the area. The middle school is private and only has two grades with more than fifty students. The expenses are covered by tuition fees and donations from Shanghai gentry and merchants. The primary school is county-run and has nine classrooms with more than five hundred students. The reporter arrived during the holidays and was unable to investigate the details.

The current District Head, Huang Yiping, has been in office for just over a month. He has good connections with local township chiefs and local gentry, so his facilities are more successful than those of his predecessors. It is hoped that Mr. Huang will continue to work hard and not have the mentality of a "five-day Beijing mayor" (the district head of the district has been changing frequently), and serve the local community.

When the reporter returned to Zhoupu, the setting sun was shining, and the white snow was like catkins, making the reporter feel relaxed and refreshed. It was already night when I arrived at Zhoupu.

### Japanese Forces on Saipan, Agiguan, and Other Islands Bravely Launch Operations

Lisbon, 24th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – According to a United Press dispatch from Agiguan Island, Japanese soldiers on the islands in the Pacific occupied by U.S. forces are still bravely launching guerrilla warfare under difficult conditions. The report on the 23rd stated: The Pacific front has now shifted to Iwo Jima. Although some time has passed since the U.S. forces occupied the area, fighting continues on the islands behind the front line. Japanese forces are still hiding on Saipan, Tinian, Agiguan, and Peleliu Islands. Although Saipan Island has been turned into a B-29 base, a U.S. black unit engaged in fierce fighting with 350 Japanese soldiers on the 15th, 16th, and 17th, resulting in casualties for the U.S. side.

Weekly Review

### The Battle of Iwo Jima

– Ying Ming

It has been three weeks since the American enemy began to invade Manila on February 3. However, until now, the American enemy, despite having paid a huge price in sacrifices, still cannot completely occupy Manila. The so-called pacification of Luzon Island and the end of the Philippine war are obviously still far away, which shows the anxiety and embarrassment of the American enemy.

In an attempt to cover up the setbacks in the Philippine war centered on Manila and to try new adventures, the American enemy has recently spared no expense in invading Iwo Jima, which belongs to the territory of Japan. The enemy forces began to actively carry out landing activities around Iwo Jima on the 16th, and officially landed on the 19th.

While carrying out the landing on Iwo Jima, the American enemy also threatened the Ogasawara Islands northeast of Iwo Jima and further harassed the southeastern coastal areas of Honshu, Japan. On the 16th and 17th, they even dispatched a mobile unit composed mainly of more than ten aircraft carriers, which appeared in the southeastern coastal waters of Muzhou, using carrier-based aircraft to bomb the Kanto and Chubu regions. This bombing was not only aimed at general military transportation facilities, but also seemed to focus on the Japanese air force bases on the southeastern coast of Muzhou, revealing their great ambition.

Iwo Jima is only a small island of eight kilometers long and four kilometers wide. Together with some other small islands, it is also called the Iwo Islands. Iwo Jima is located in the middle of the Mariana Islands and the southeastern part of Honshu, Japan, about 600 nautical miles from Yokohama and Guam, 900 nautical miles west from Taiwan, and slightly northeast of the Ogasawara Islands.

The purpose of the American enemy's invasion of Iwo Jima is certainly not just to cover up the setbacks in the Manila war. It has the ambition to occupy Iwo Jima and then make greater adventures in other places. The American enemy believes that the Iwo Islands and Ogasawara Islands are strategically important. They are now the outpost of Japan from southeastern Honshu to the Taiwan area. To advance further, they must first occupy this outpost, Iwo Jima. Iwo Jima gives the American enemy's naval and air force operations a great restraint. For example, enemy aircraft flying from the Mariana Islands base to bomb Japan are often detected and intercepted by the Japanese air reconnaissance unit on Iwo Jima.

The intention of the American enemy is to gain a foothold in the Iwo Jima area, threaten Honshu to the north, invade the East China Sea to the west, and then join forces with the troops advancing north from the Philippines to threaten the Chinese coast, that is, to prepare for the so-called mainland operation.

According to news from Stockholm, the capital of Sweden, the American enemy fleet in the Pacific under the command of Nimitz is divided into three teams. The first team cruises in the coastal waters of Japan, the second team is operating in the Ogasawara Islands and Iwo Islands area, and the third team is in the Philippine sea area. The mobile unit that harassed the southeastern sea of Honshu, Japan on the 16th and 17th is said to belong to the first team.

The battle of Iwo Jima is in progress. The Japanese military's resistance is extremely strong. To date, more than 30,000 enemy troops have landed, but at least one-third of them have been annihilated by the Japanese army. It is said that the losses and sacrifices in this enemy landing battle on Iwo Jima are far more severe than in the past landings on Tarawa, Tinian, and the Marshall Islands. Although Iwo Jima is small in area, its capacity for burying enemy troops is very large. Undoubtedly, all the American enemy's wishful thinking will end in a disastrous defeat. The closer the war gets to the Japanese mainland, the stronger Japan's defense and the greater the enemy's difficulties. Our ally has not only already established a strong defense on the mainland, which will make the American enemy flinch, but also completed a comprehensive defense posture on the Chinese mainland. If the enemy invades, they will be severely beaten.

### Promoting the New Movement Work, Eliminating Opium and Narcotics in Anhui Province – Governor Lin of Anhui Discusses Administrative Policies

Nanjing, 24th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – Governor Lin of Anhui Province recently came to Nanjing to report to the central government. The reporter, knowing that Mr. Lin is the Secretary-General of the New Movement Association, specifically asked for his opinion on the future direction of the New Movement and the issue of opium eradication. The answers were as follows:

(Question) What is the focus of promoting the New Movement today? (Answer) The focus of promoting the New Movement today is in the countryside, training farmers everywhere to be able to govern and defend themselves, increase production, and subsidize education. (Question) After taking charge of Anhui, how will you promote the New Movement in Anhui Province? (Answer) To mobilize and coordinate with the party, government, and military to promote it together, it is expected that the strength will be increased. (Question) It seems that there is no major development in promoting the New Movement in various places. What is the reason? (Answer) The reason is that the county magistrates are busy with their official duties and have no time to take care of it. Also, some county magistrates do not understand the New Movement very well, which affects development. (Question) Are the chairmen and members of the New Movement branch associations in various counties concurrently held by the county magistrates? (Answer) If they are held concurrently by the county magistrates, there will be no cooperation. (Question) Is there a good way? (Answer) Only by asking the Central Youth Cadre School of the New Movement Association to train more New Movement youth cadres and send them to various places to assist the county magistrates, specializing in promoting the New Movement. (Question) What is the knowledge of the New Movement among young people in Anhui? (Answer) They already have considerable knowledge. (Question) People who have recently returned from Anhui Province said that the New Movement has made significant progress in Anhui, perhaps because the governor has always been responsible for the New Movement. It is expected that other provinces will definitely be able to follow suit, and the promotion of the New Movement in various provinces may be more active. (Answer) Yes. (Question) There are many opium-producing areas in Anhui, and there are many smokers. I wonder what your policies are for opium eradication? (Answer) The Opium Eradication Implementation Committee has already been established, and I serve as the chairman. The committee has five groups: general affairs, opium planting prohibition, opium transportation prohibition, opium smoking prohibition, and inspection. The main purpose is to implement the opium eradication plan. Regarding the elimination of opium addiction, on the 11th of this month, due to the joint request of young comrades and military police officers to report, I specifically ordered Wu Linzhi, the director of the police affairs office, to conduct a general opium and narcotics inspection with the commander of the Seventh Regiment, along with the military police and youth league members. Dozens of opium dens were found in various districts, and the situation was quite good. In short, I will take Bengbu as an absolute opium-free zone and start from there to eliminate opium addiction throughout the province in the shortest possible time, sweep away the national shame of opium, and comfort Chairman Wang in heaven with Chairman Chen's continued vigorous opium eradication policy.

### Military Leaders From Various Regions Hold Talks to Discuss Ensuring Public Security Measures

Nanjing, 14th (Central News Agency) – As the Greater East Asia War enters its final decisive phase, China's role in the war becomes increasingly important. Consolidating the rear and supporting the front requires stabilizing the people's livelihood and ensuring the smooth completion of public security work. Therefore, since the Greater East Asia War, the National Government's policies have focused on these two major goals. These two policies are mutually supportive and cannot be neglected. On the 12th of this month, to stabilize the people's livelihood, the government issued emergency measures to suppress prices. To discuss ensuring public security work, a military leaders' conference was held on the 23rd and 24th of this month, gathering responsible military leaders from across the country to exchange ideas. Through these two days of intensive discussions, thorough measures have been taken regarding future public security policies. There is no doubt that local public security will become increasingly clear in the future.

### Japanese Troops Advance to the Vicinity of Baoqing

Lisbon, 24th (Central News Agency) – According to a Chongqing dispatch, the Chongqing Military Council announced on the 22nd that two Japanese units were advancing westward from Saiqing in Hunan Province. One unit has reached a point twelve kilometers northwest of the city. Baoqing is a key stronghold on the western side of the Japanese corridor between China and Vietnam.

### US Sinks Prisoner Ships a Total of Three Times

Zurich, 24th (Central News Agency) – The Japanese government has announced that American bombers and submarines in the Pacific have repeatedly sunk Japanese ships full of American prisoners. Neutral countries believe this is either anti-Axis propaganda or suspect that Japan is deliberately sinking the ships and massacring prisoners. However, a Washington dispatch on the 22nd conveyed the story of survivors from an American ship that sank in the Philippine Sea last December, carrying 1,500 American prisoners. This testimony confirms past rumors. Reuters also reported that this is the third time a prisoner transport ship has been sunk by the US military in the Pacific.

### Enemy Planes Raid Nanjing, Three Shot Down

Nanjing, 24th (Central News Agency) – Four enemy American P-51 fighter planes attacked Nanjing at 0:10 PM on the 23rd. Japanese air defense forces engaged and shot down one plane, while damaging two others.

### Anti-Axis Forces Cross the Ruhr River on the Western Front, Vanguard Reaches the Outskirts of Düren

Berlin, 24th (Central News Agency) – Havas reports that a German military spokesman stated yesterday that enemy forces launched a large-scale attack in the sector between Roermond and Aachen. They have established small bridgeheads several kilometers deep in Gevenich, Selgersdorf, and Birgden. General Simpson's troops have crossed the Ruhr River and reached the outskirts of Düren. Fighting is intense along the entire front.

Berlin, 24th (Central News Agency) – Havas reports that the Anti-Axis offensive on the Ruhr front has entered a critical stage. The breaching of the Ruhr River dams has delayed the Anti-Axis advance, benefiting German preparations on the Western Front and potentially easing the overall situation. The Anti-Axis reluctance to shift the focus of their offensive away from Aachen is also due to the difficulty of moving supplies, and the enemy's attack points were anticipated by the German forces. The areas near Linnich and Düren are clearly the focal points of the offensive. The US First Army is assisting the Ninth Army's attack, and the British Second Army will also provide support. It is uncertain whether the bulk of the US First Army, currently stationed behind the Ninth Army, will immediately join the battle. The Anti-Axis forces likely aim to break into the Rhine River plain, sweep through the German positions along the Meuse River, and seize the area west of the Rhine before invading the industrial areas on the right bank of the Rhine and the great plains of northern Germany. American material superiority has allowed them to cross the Ruhr River in several locations, approaching the outskirts of Düren, but this is not enough to determine the outcome of the battle. Past experience has shown that the success or failure of a major Anti-Axis offensive cannot be determined solely by the edges of the German defensive zone.

### Six Thousand British and American Planes Bomb German Transportation Lines

Stockholm, Sweden, 24th (Central News Agency)

Anti-Axis air forces launched a large-scale bombing campaign against German transportation infrastructure on the 22nd, aiming to paralyze transportation throughout Germany. The air raid was unprecedented. In addition to the British Home Forces, other air forces were mobilized, totaling six thousand aircraft. The bombing tactics were also different from the past, with a large number of planes divided into small formations to bomb various German transportation targets. The raids continued until nightfall. British Mosquito squadrons bombed Berlin, and over two thousand American heavy bombers were deployed during the day.

### Turkey and Other Countries Declare War on Japan and Germany

Lisbon, 24th (Central News Agency) – According to an Ankara dispatch, the Turkish government convened an emergency parliament on the 23rd and passed a declaration of war against Japan and Germany.

Tokyo, 24th (Central News Agency) – According to foreign news reports, the Turkish government abruptly declared war on Japan and Germany on the 23rd. According to Foreign Minister Saracoğlu's explanation, this was due to pressure from the United Kingdom and the United States. When the Turkish parliament resolved to sever diplomatic and economic relations with Japan on January 3rd of this year, the Turkish Foreign Minister met with the Japanese Ambassador to Turkey, Mr. Kurihara, to explain the details of the severance. The Turkish government intended to maintain friendly relations with Japan, but the surrounding circumstances did not allow it. This time, succumbing to the power of the United Kingdom and the United States, they were forced to issue a declaration of war against Japan. In reality, Turkey's participation in the war poses no threat to Japan. Now that a state of war exists, Japan will not hesitate to issue a declaration of war. The Japanese Foreign Ministry has issued a statement expressing Japan's position.

Lisbon, 24th (Central News Agency) – According to a dispatch from Montevideo, the Uruguayan government declared war on Japan and Germany on the 21st.

Lisbon, 24th (Central News Agency) – According to a broadcast from Tokyo, in addition to Turkey, Egypt, Iceland, Chile, Paraguay, Peru, Uruguay, and Venezuela were invited by the United Kingdom and the United States to participate in the San Francisco Conference. Among them, the Central and South American countries and Turkey have already declared war on the Axis powers, and Egypt and Iceland will also be subjected to the same pressure from the United Kingdom and the United States, as can be seen from the Turkish Foreign Minister's statement.

### Air Defense Headquarters to Hold Joint Air Raid Shelter Construction Week Next Month, Hoping Citizens Will Diligently Build Shelters

The Shanghai Special Municipality Air Defense Headquarters, in light of the recent attempts by enemy American air forces to disrupt the morale of the peaceful areas by indiscriminately bombing major cities and massacring our people, and considering the actual situation in Hankou and the current air defense situation in this city, believes that the popularization and expansion of air raid shelters is essential. Therefore, it has been decided to implement Air Raid Shelter Construction Week from March 1st to 7th (one week), hoping that every citizen will make every effort to complete the construction of air raid shelters during this construction week to avoid damage from enemy air raids. The Municipal Police Bureau has been instructed to inform all subordinate branches so that the Baojia personnel and the general public thoroughly understand the purpose of this matter and actively complete it in accordance with the implementation measures, or repair and expand them, ensuring that they are properly flawless. Mayor Zhou, concurrently the Minister of the Air Defense Headquarters, issued a statement, hoping that every citizen will do their utmost to realize this plan. The air raid shelter construction methods and Minister Zhou's statement are recorded as follows:

Construction Methods

(1) Private vacant land, (2) Public vacant land, (3) Inside houses (must have an exit), (4) Underground or semi-underground air raid shelters with roofs are ideal standards. If it is not possible to install roofs due to lack of materials, hard work, or other reasons, efforts should still be made to gradually install them. (5) All construction costs shall be borne by the builder. (6) The standard capacity is up to fifteen people, and there must be entrances and exits on both sides. (7) If it is a covered type, wood or bamboo with a diameter of three inches or more should be spaced one foot five inches apart to form beams and columns, and covered with thirty centimeters of soil. (8) The entrances and exits must be constructed solidly to withstand the impact of explosions. (9) When building on public vacant land and roads, the Municipal Works Bureau must be consulted to investigate the existence of underground buried objects. However, for Nanjing Road, North Sichuan Road, and Great Shanghai Road, the Works Bureau will investigate the existence of such underground buried objects and indicate the locations where construction will not be obstructed. (10) If construction on private vacant land is rejected by the landowner, the branch offices must actively mediate. (11) During the implementation of the Air Raid Shelter Construction Week, personnel selected and assigned by the heads of each branch office should go to the construction sites at any time to provide proper guidance. (12) During the implementation period of the Air Raid Shelter Construction Week, the procedure for obtaining permission from the Works Bureau as stated in Article 9 of this plan may be omitted to reduce citizen hassle and the time required to obtain permission. Citizens should only follow the instructions of the head of the police branch office regarding the suitability of the construction site and do their best to carry out construction. Each branch office must not disappoint the citizens and should investigate whether the construction site is suitable.

Minister's Statement

Regarding the Air Raid Shelter Digging Week planned and implemented by the Shanghai Special Municipality Air Defense Headquarters, Mayor Zhou, in his capacity as Minister, issued the following statement: "It is better to be prepared than sorry" is a well-known saying. Historical facts are sufficient to prove the truth of this statement. Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, our ally Japan has fully demonstrated its spirit of righteousness in striving for the survival and freedom of the entire East Asia. We are also cooperating with our allies in this critical juncture of life and death. However, the enemy Americans are still fully supporting the Chongqing regime and carrying out indiscriminate bombing in our major cities. This accumulated behavior only causes suffering to the majority of innocent civilians, and good cities are on the verge of destruction. This illegal and inhumane behavior has been fully demonstrated in the indiscriminate bombing of the Hankou area. At this time of decisive battle, enemy air raids on Shanghai are naturally expected. In order to minimize the damage caused by air raids, the Air Defense Headquarters has repeatedly called for the rapid construction of air raid shelters, but the results have not been satisfactory. Judging from the damage caused by recent enemy aircraft bombing and strafing and anti-aircraft artillery fire, it is clear that there is still much room for improvement in air defense facilities. In order to thoroughly promote the construction of air raid shelters for all Shanghai citizens, the Air Defense Authority has specially held Air Raid Shelter Digging Week to awaken the widespread attention and implementation of all citizens. Citizens must know that this measure is for the sake of their own lives and property, so it is hoped that citizens will cooperate closely with the police branch office in charge to complete this measure. This air raid shelter will naturally be built on public vacant land or by the roadside as a principle, but if there are obstacles such as underground works such as water pipes or gas pipes, it may not be subject to these restrictions in certain circumstances. The Municipal Construction Bureau (formerly the Works Bureau) will begin to investigate the location of underground works. Before digging air raid shelters, citizens can first inquire with the Construction Bureau to know the existence of underground works at the digging site and obtain accurate instructions. Individuals or groups should also plan together with their respective police branch offices in order to make the digging uniform. Each police branch office will be able to assist the people in digging under the guidance of the Construction Bureau. During Air Raid Shelter Digging Week, we hope that the largest number of air raid shelters will be dug, and we hope that every citizen will do their utmost to realize this plan."

As for the issue of salary increase, the bureau has generally planned and decided, and will announce and implement it within days.

### Expanding Welfare Society

In order to seek the welfare of the police officers themselves, the Municipal Police Bureau is actively expanding the police bureau's welfare society. It is learned that the municipal government has increased the society's funds to 130 million yuan (originally 30 million yuan) in preparation for purchasing cheap food rice, and it is heard that the police bureau's public dining hall is also being expanded.

### Inland River Shipping Company Increases Shifts

The city authorities are carrying out plans to evacuate the population, but the issue of traffic is a prerequisite for the evacuation of the population. It is heard that the city's inland river shipping company, in addition to maintaining the original Shanghai-Suzhou direct express ships, has also specially opened a Shanghai-Kunshan express shift. Due to the reduction of train services, the number of citizens switching to inland river shipping is quite crowded. Therefore, the company is currently actively adjusting the original route.

### Finance Bureau Adds Southern District Special Tax Collection Office

The Municipal Finance Bureau has added a fourth Southern District Branch Collection Office on the upper floor of the French Post Office Building at No. 9 South Huangpu Road to take over the consumption special tax affairs in the Nanshi area. The bureau's announcement is recorded as follows: "According to the Shanghai Municipal Government Shanghai Municipal Team No. 2 No. 12645 training order: According to the Ministry of Finance's Yang telegram, the retail of goods and the special tax on consumption of banquets and hotels, in addition to the Shanghai city area, was originally levied by the Ministry's Taxation Department, but the scope is wide and the audit is difficult to be comprehensive. From January 1, 34, the above-mentioned special tax, all within the jurisdiction of your municipal government, is entrusted to your municipal government to handle it on its behalf, so as to enrich tax revenue, etc. Therefore, it should be followed. Now, the Shanghai Special Municipality Finance Bureau Consumption Special Tax Fourth Southern District Branch Collection Office (upper floor of the French Post Office Building, No. 9 South Huangpu Road) is first established to take over the consumption special tax in the Nanshi area, and the system of dispatching personnel to collect taxes is abolished. All businesses in the Nanshi area shall quickly report and pay the retail of goods and the special tax on consumption of banquets and hotels that have been collected on behalf of the year 34 since January 1 until the end of February. From now on, the monthly tax shall be paid before the 25th of each month. If it is found that tax evasion or overdue payment occurs, it will be punished accordingly."

### Application Method for Goods Rationing

When various agencies in this city apply to the goods rationing office for rationing, it is often covered by the department or handling personnel of the general affairs department of each agency with a department stamp or private seal, and even apply directly to the department in charge of the office, which is not consistent. It is heard that in order to ensure verification, the office has stipulated that in the future, applications for rationing from various agencies shall be sealed and applied for by the head of the competent agency before they can be verified and distributed. Applications sealed and applied for by the department or handling personnel shall not take effect.

Brief Comment

### Importance of Self-Discipline

Recently, there has been a rumor in the city that there is large-scale gambling in a certain place, and the gambling house has been revived. A certain dance hall can be specially operated until 3:00 AM because it has secretly used a special name, so there is nothing to fear.

At the same time, we have also received many letters from readers who believe that this phenomenon should not occur during the municipal innovation. We believe that if it is indeed the case, the municipal standing committee will definitely not let it go, and the citizens can rest assured.

The name is the name, the fact is the fact, and the fact cannot be confused by secretly using the name. Officials cannot use the name of hanging up a sheep's head to sell dog meat. In this decisive period and in this period of municipal renewal, social affairs must move in the direction of adapting to the wartime system and benefiting the public welfare. If it violates the wartime system and violates the public welfare, even if there are means of stealing the sky and changing the day, and even if there are means of deceiving and taking advantage of, it will inevitably be opposed by the social theory.

We hope that the Chinese and Japanese officials and people living in Shanghai will jointly recognize the trend of the times and value the way of self-discipline.

### Director Xu of the Economic Bureau Discusses Economic Policies: The Fifth Regular Press Conference Held Yesterday

The Shanghai Special Municipality Propaganda Department held its fifth regular press conference at 2:30 PM yesterday (the 24th) in the conference room on the second floor of the Municipal Government Building. Director Xu of the Municipal Economic Bureau was invited to attend, report on the recent adjustments within the bureau, and answer questions from reporters regarding economic policy matters. The details are recorded below:

Selling Above the Price Limit: Legal Action Will Be Taken

(1) (Question) Now that the new price limits for major commodities at retail outlets have been approved, all companies and businesses should abide by these new price limits. If any business continues to feign compliance while acting otherwise, how does the Bureau intend to handle this?

Director Xu replied: Now that the new price limits for major commodities at retail outlets have been approved, all companies and businesses should strictly comply. If any dare to feign compliance while acting otherwise, this Bureau will not only dispatch personnel for secret investigations at any time but also allow citizens to report such violations. Once verified, this Bureau will immediately notify the Police Bureau to take legal action.

Strengthening Trade Association Organizations

(2) (Question) There are many trade associations for major commodities in the city with overlapping business categories, and many also have unsound internal organizations. What steps are currently being considered to strengthen the organization of various trade associations?

(Answer) It has been found that a total of 244 association units have been established in this city, of which 72 units are related to major commodities, 32 units to secondary commodities, and 140 units to ordinary commodities. Among them, some have similar natures and business categories, leading to frequent disputes, while others suffer from loose association affairs due to unsound organizations. It is indeed necessary to thoroughly reorganize them. To strengthen the organization of associations, this Bureau will closely analyze all associations, compile a reorganization program, and implement it in two steps:

(1) Reorganization: Reorganization work will be carried out for those ordered by decree and those with practical needs. Those with overlapping business categories will be merged, those with unsound organizations will be reorganized, and those with no need to exist will be eliminated to achieve a sound and manageable structure. (2) Management: Management methods will start with a comprehensive investigation, examining personnel selection, association affairs, work progress, economic conditions, and so on, one by one. A performance evaluation method will also be established to serve as a basis for review and to achieve strengthening.

Careful Plans to Promote Production

(3) (Question) Regarding the management of materials in this city and the promotion of production, what are the future strategies for advancement?

(Answer) For the management of materials, the priority is to thoroughly implement the registration of various major commodities. In the past, this Bureau only handled four types: candles, matches, and coal. Now, following the issuance of the "Implementation Measures for Unified Evaluation of Important Commodities" by the Ministry of Industry, covering a total of sixteen types, our department is preparing to continue organizing and implementing registration at the beginning of next month. As for how to promote production, the relevant departments have been instructed to make careful plans, and the associations of relevant production factories have been instructed to submit plans for increasing production in their respective industries for review, in order to supervise and gradually implement them.

Investigating and Reorganizing Industrial and Commercial Registration

(4) (Question) Although the handling of industrial and commercial registration has been relatively active in the past, there are still businesses operating as usual without applying for registration. At the same time, some have already applied for registration but have not yet received their business licenses. How do you plan to reorganize this in the future?

(Answer) (1) It has been found that merchants in this city have not fully complied with the procedures of obtaining certificates from this Bureau for doing business and setting up shops. As a result, some established or newly established industrial and commercial firms have not applied to this Bureau for registration and licensing before starting operations. In order to reorganize the registration, the Ministry of Industry previously requested the Municipal Government to instruct this Bureau to notify all factories in the city to complete registration by the end of March of this year. Those who fail to do so within the time limit will be punished according to regulations, and their existing licenses may be revoked. This Bureau has already distributed notices and announcements in the news to comply with this. (2) For industrial and commercial registrations that have been applied for, personnel have been dispatched to investigate the reported capital. Some industrial and commercial firms have been found to be consistent with their reports and should be issued licenses in order. Many others are inconsistent with their reports and will be instructed to re-apply for registration with accurate information.

Continuing to Inspect Warehouse Goods

(5) (Question) What was the situation of the past inspections of public and private warehouses throughout the city? It has not yet been announced. Unscrupulous merchants who hoard and manipulate market prices have not been severely punished. Is this inspection work still ongoing? If unscrupulous merchants who hoard and manipulate are found, how will they be sanctioned?

(Answer) This Bureau's inspection of public and private warehouses and storage facilities has been conducted by personnel dispatched by former Director Xu, together with the Economic Security Department, dividing the area into groups for investigation. About 70-80% of the work has been completed. After I took office, I will continue to dispatch personnel to carry out the inspections. If any illegal acts of hoarding and speculation are found, they will be severely punished in accordance with the "Temporary Regulations for Combating Wartime Economic Offenses" and the provisions of the "Provisional Measures for Investigating Warehouse Storage of Goods" drafted by this Bureau.

### Wealth and Fame is Being Performed Today in Two Shows

Students from fourteen universities in this city are jointly performing "Wealth and Fame" at the Guanxin Grand Theater to raise scholarship funds. Yesterday's two shows, matinee and evening, were fully booked. The performance results were satisfactory. Today is Sunday, the last two shows, one at 10 AM and the other at 7 PM. We especially invite the supporting patrons to arrive on time. Those who have pre-purchased honorary tickets and regular tickets can exchange them temporarily. Those who had tickets for 2 PM on the 18th can exchange them for tickets for 10 AM today. And those who had tickets for 7 PM on the 18th can exchange them for tickets for 7 PM today. We deeply apologize for the repeated changes in the ticket exchange procedure due to other reasons! We hope that the supporting patrons will understand.

Saving Funeral Expenses to Contribute to Scholarships

Mr. Yan Man Yu Yun writes: "Respectfully announcing that the 25th of February marks the second anniversary of the passing of my late son, Shou Tong. Originally, I intended to follow custom and hire monks to perform rituals. However, lamenting the difficult times and deeply saddened by the large number of young people who cannot afford to go to school, I am donating the 60,000 yuan originally set aside for the rituals along with this letter. Half will be used for the Xinwen Bao scholarship fund, and half will be used for your newspaper's scholarship fund, to fulfill his lifelong ambition to study hard. I pray that you will accept and distribute them accordingly."

Honesty and Integrity: A Commendable Ancient Virtue

Mr. Chen Haisheng writes: "Respectfully announcing that yesterday afternoon, I lost a check. Fortunately, Mr. Tang Xueji found it and returned it to me at the address. In gratitude, I intended to offer a small reward to express my respect. Mr. Tang's integrity is admirable, and he firmly refused to accept the reward. His honesty and integrity are commendable. Therefore, I am donating the 3,000 yuan in savings certificates that I had prepared as a reward to your newspaper as a scholarship fund to benefit Mr. Tang. I pray that you will accept it."

Remaining balance: 37,632,286 yuan.

### Art Exhibition Held to Help Orphans

The Tushanwan Orphanage, recently facing financial difficulties, is holding an art exhibition of its products at the Ningbo Native Place Association Gallery. Over a hundred oil paintings are displayed and offered for sale. In addition, Mr. Xu Tongyuan and Mr. Zhang Dagong have donated Chinese and foreign stamps, the proceeds of which will be used for the orphanage's expenses. There are many valuable items, such as the first Chinese airmail stamps, Wanshou stamps, and provisional surcharge stamps. There are also ink treasures by Ma Xiangbo, such as vertical scrolls with couplets. The exhibition will be held until the 27th of this month. We hope that kind-hearted people who are familiar with this charitable cause will visit and purchase items to support this righteous cause.

### Public Basketball First Round Finals: Zhongbei Defeats Hualian 32-28 in a Tense Match

The two basketball giants, Zhongbei and Hualian, met last night in the public basketball 甲甲 first-round finals. As a result of the intense battle, Zhongbei defeated Hualian by a margin of four points, 32-28. In the first half, Zhongbei led 19-12.

Because tickets were sold in advance last night, the number of tickets was strictly limited, so the order in the stadium was well maintained, which took a lot of effort. Both sides gave quite exciting performances. Zhongbei had good offense and defense and maintained the upper hand throughout. Li Zhengzhong, Chen Xuechong, and Zhuo Guorong were particularly outstanding. Hualian had poor luck with their ball handling and missed many shots. The usually accurate shooters were all out of form last night, due to nervousness. Hualian emphasized defense over offense last night, and their breakthroughs under the basket did not seem to work.

In addition to Li, Chen, and Zhuo, Zhongbei's lineup also included Shen Yugong and Zhao Yalin. When Zhuo Guorong was fouled out, he was replaced by Bao Songyuan. Hualian's lineup included Wu Chengzhang, Que Li, Xu Jusheng, and the guards Qu Xilin, Fan Qinggong, and Kong Guangyi. Zhang Liangxiong and Que Li were fouled out one after another, and Jin Changchun replaced them.

Hualian began to chase. After Zhuo was fouled out in the second half, Hualian scored three consecutive times, creating a tense situation of 28-25. Unfortunately, they could not turn the tide from there, and Zhongbei scored again directly. There were many fouls on both sides last night, but the sportsmanship was excellent.

Tonight's schedule: (1) Xuebai vs. Overseas Chinese (female) at 5:15 PM. (2) Yikang vs. Three Provinces (female) at 6 PM. (This) V team vs. Fat team (甲乙) at 6:45 PM.

It is scheduled to be held today at 2 PM in the gymnasium of the Army Dormitory (Xiqing), featuring He Ren against a Shanghai mixed team. All donors will receive a complimentary ticket.

### "The British Empire's" Bankruptcy White Paper Pleads for Aid from Various Nations; Restoring Its Former Status Has Become a Delirious Dream

On November 28th of last year, the British government released the so-called "Bankruptcy White Paper," automatically declaring that it had exhausted "more than half of what had been accumulated since the era of our grandfathers" during the five years of war. It is a well-known fact that Britain has been using the legacies from the Victorian era. But why did the British government specifically publicize these facts? Just as a person burdened with debt hopes that creditors who fear his bankruptcy will temporarily spare him from it, Britain deliberately exposed its own predicament to the United States, the various dominions of the British Empire, and the countries of the old Sterling area, hoping to restore its former international status with the aid of these countries. In other words, Britain cannot and does not expect to regenerate itself through legitimate means, but only seeks to exploit other countries. However, this can be said to be a dangerous tightrope walk. There is doubt as to whether the lamentations of a fading Britain can move countries that have changed their minds. In short, the "Bankruptcy White Paper" can be said to have proven that the depth of the crisis facing the British Empire is more profound than anticipated. This article provides an overview of the past, present, and future rise and fall of the British Empire, as well as the domestic and foreign contradictions encountered by Britain, from the above perspective.

A Double-Edged Sword

"The various conditions that have formed the foundation of Britain's existence for the past hundred years, which Britain confidently believed it would possess eternally, are in reality, merely things prone to change. Today, this is becoming increasingly clear as time passes."

This is what André Siegfried said on the first page of the introduction to "The Crisis of Britain." These words, written in 1931 when Britain faced an unprecedented crisis, no longer require any explanation today. Because the Second World War has brought the political and economic foundations of Britain's international standing to the brink of danger – this is an undeniable and obvious fact.

Since the last Great War, how has Britain adapted what Siegfried called "things prone to change" to the rapidly changing realities of the world situation? How has it prolonged them as much as possible? These are two questions that are constantly being discussed. As the birthplace of capitalism and the world's factory, Britain entered modern history by adhering rigidly to the traditions of capitalism, while also striving, based on thorough realism, to align its steps with the new direction of progress in the world. Therefore, the more those who believed in possessing things eternally understood things were "prone to change," the more earnestly they strived. The occurrence of the present war can be said to be partly due to Britain's anxiety.

However, it is ultimately impossible to put new wine in old wineskins. The various policies adopted by Britain are, in themselves, sensible and realistic. But the "grand synthesis" of these policies is nothing more than further deepening the worries of the aging empire. How skillfully did Britain utilize the strength of the United States and the Soviet Union since the outbreak of war with Germany? However, how is Britain suffering today from the expansion of American and Soviet power? Observing this, the truth of the matter becomes clear.

The above matters, on the one hand, made Britain's domestic and foreign policies quite ingenious, but on the other hand, they created major loopholes. For example, former British Prime Minister Chamberlain, who quietly passed away as the embodiment of the so-called appeasement policy, must have understood very well that if Britain were to be drawn into a war like the previous Great War, the already eroded foundation of the British Empire would inevitably crack. Precisely for this reason, he was willing to bow to Hitler in Munich. However, in order to maintain the declining British Empire and suppress the rising Axis powers, a year later, this Prime Minister Chamberlain had no choice but to declare war on Germany. In Britain's hands, there wasn't even a double-edged sword.

A Lavish Past

Due to the rapid progress of history today, people easily forget the past. Britain's belief that the foundations that made the nation prosperous in the nineteenth century could last for eternity feels like a delirious dream today. However, in order to know the extent to which Britain's international status has declined, it is still necessary to take a glimpse at the Victorian era.

British philosopher and economist Stanley Jevons wrote the following passage in 1866:

"Free trade, built on our coal resources, has made several parts of the earth's surface become possessions of England: — The plains of North America and Russia are our fields; Chicago and Odessa are our granaries; Canada and the Baltic coast are our forests; Australian pastures are grazing sheep for England; South America has England's herds of cattle; Peru brings silver; California and Australian gold flow into London; the Chinese cultivate tea for us; the Dutch East Indies plantations send coffee, sugar, and medicine; Spain and France are England's vineyards; the Mediterranean coast is England's orchard. Our cotton fields were formerly in the southern United States, but today they are everywhere in the world's major cotton-producing regions."

This is the so-called Pax Britannica. It is now widely known that this "peace under British rule" was built on the sacrifices of many other countries. "Anyone who looks at a map of the British Empire should hang their head in shame!" This is what Stafford Cripps said when he was a socialist in the past. The so-called "free" trade was sending missionaries first, and then sending warships and armies to open up commodity sales routes and forcibly engaging in trade. China drowned in opium, India was perpetually trapped in hunger, and African natives were massacred like locusts: — this is the truth of "free" trade! Even the European countries that considered themselves "civilized" were seen as inferior by the British. "Anyone coming off the ship is a black slave!" This arrogant remark by a certain Englishman fully demonstrates the sense of superiority of the British at that time.

The Decay of the Throne

When the Corn Laws were repealed in 1846, Lord Robert Peel said, "Does England need to fear competition?" But since the twentieth century, Britain has no longer been a country that does not fear competition. In the international trade that Britain had created, countries emerged one after another that competed with and surpassed Britain. In short, goods appeared that were cheaper and better than British goods. Britain's "free" trade, which was so important, ended up endangering its own survival.

It was not only competition with other countries that led to the decline of the British Empire. The domestic political, economic, social system, and colonial rule policies that Britain boasted to the world also gradually decayed from within as time passed. Thus, the collapsing effects from both within and without became closely related to each other.

The aforementioned factors in the decline of the British Empire manifested their effects significantly with the outbreak of the First World War. Britain's intentions in the previous Great War were to suppress the rise of Germany, maintain the balance of power in Europe, protect the British Empire's trade routes, and seize Germany's colonies. These goals were temporarily achieved later, but during and after the war, Britain's domestic system and the cohesion of the British Empire exposed their fragility. In the world market, the United States replaced Germany and became Britain's powerful rival, while other countries also strengthened their positions as competitors against Britain. Furthermore, the Versailles system created by Britain and the United States, among others, actually promoted the rise of Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy.

The suffering of Britain after the previous Great War was most concentratedly expressed in the financial crisis of 1931. This financial crisis, which attacked Britain as part of the world panic, revealed the fact that Britain had to admit defeat to the United States in international trade and finance. Britain's social policies of "purchasing social stability" by supporting the unemployed with the burdens of capitalists and taxpayers revealed their limits.

In the face of this financial crisis, the policies adopted by Britain were, firstly, to effectively devalue the value of the pound and adopt British Empire trade protection policies in order to boost exports, and secondly, to reduce unemployment benefits domestically in order to restore fiscal balance. These two measures were epoch-making for Britain, but they still inevitably led to a political crisis in Britain. At that time, MacDonald, the Prime Minister of the second Labour Cabinet, in order to suppress the Labour Party's opposition to cutting unemployment benefits, announced his withdrawal from the Labour Party and formed a national unity cabinet. Although the political crisis was overcome as a result, the British political world has since been divided into a national unity faction centered on the Conservative Party and an opposition faction dominated by the Labour Party. The relationship between these two factions, unlike the past Conservative Party (Tory) and Liberal Party (Whig), which made it easy for political parties to privately transfer power, was based on the relationship between the old conservative forces and the newly emerging political forces—the working class. It is very clear that the so-called constitutional norms could not function smoothly under such circumstances. Since then, Britain has always been in a "state of emergency" politically.

The Annual Account is Insufficient

Today, Britain is cooperating with the United States and the Soviet Union to attack Germany in Europe, while in East Asia, it is jointly launching a counter-offensive against Japan with the United States and Chongqing.

Looking back at the path that Britain has taken since the beginning of this war, it can be said that it has almost been defeated on the battlefield, and it has only succeeded in reversing the decline by using scheming. After the disastrous defeat at Dunkirk, the bombing of the British Isles by German aircraft made people feel that they could not recover. Fortunately, the development of the German-Soviet War allowed Britain to breathe a sigh of relief. After that, Britain sought American aid and took advantage of the strength of the United States and the Soviet Union, and as a result, it was able to push the German army back to the border. During this period, it also directly faced domestic crises several times. Especially when it suffered a major defeat in the Greater East Asia War, the Churchill Cabinet received severe criticism from public opinion. However, because the political truce agreement between the parties established at the same time as the outbreak of the war is still in effect, the domestic system has not undergone major changes. From the continuous bombing of London as early as 1940 to 1941, to the power of the V1 and V2 rockets, which plunged the British people into the abyss of terror, they have not completely lost their will to fight.

However, has Britain at least consolidated the foundations for its self-existence and self-reliance through the war thus far? In fact, it is not! As mentioned above, the worries of the British Empire, due to the risks of war, have been superficially somewhat mended, but in reality, they have instead rapidly deepened.

Zhuangzi said: "The daily account is insufficient, but the annual account is abundant." Britain since the Battle of Dunkirk is the opposite: the daily account is abundant, but the annual account is insufficient. (Translated from the Allied World Weekly, Volume 25, Issue 51)

### Map of the Iwo Jima War Zone

Since mid-January of this year, the enemy Americans have successively landed in Mindoro, Lingayen, and Manila in the Philippines, and are currently engaged in fierce warfare in northern Luzon. The enemy Americans have suffered extremely great damage on the Luzon Island front and may be annihilated by the Japanese army and navy. Therefore, the enemy army is under a stagnant war situation and is becoming even more anxious, so on the 16th of this month, it began a landing operation on Iwo Jima near the Japanese mainland. For several days, its progress has been only two or three hundred yards in area. The enemy is suffering from hard battles and losses, and its morale is greatly depressed. The Japanese army is calmly responding to the battle, using air force and ground forces to jointly counterattack, and the sea is exerting the power of submarines, so the losses suffered by the enemy are even greater than those in the past battles of Gilbert and Tarawa. According to enemy propaganda, they plan to seek a second base, such as invading Ryukyu, Taiwan, or the Chinese coast. But considering the heavy blows suffered by the enemy during this landing on Iwo Jima, this attempt will eventually become a dream.

### Germany's New Weapon Atomic Bomb Explosive Power Hundreds of Times Greater than Explosives

If the experiment of chain-destroying uranium nuclei is successful, then it can release an enormous amount of binding energy, which we have not yet experienced, its power is millions of times greater than that of the explosives used today. It is said that the German army in Western Europe used atomic bombs with terrifying destructive power in this major offensive. Hearing this news cannot help but remind one of the "Neumann explosives" that explosives experts of major powers are most concerned about today. Neumann explosives, mainly in Germany and the Soviet Union, have begun to be used in military artillery. Its breaking power is extremely fierce and can penetrate heavy armor plates that traditional artillery cannot break through. This is a special method of concentrating the explosive power of gunpowder in one direction.

If this great pressure of Neumann explosives can be concentrated at one point, then the artificial destruction of uranium nuclei that various countries are vying to study becomes possible. Japanese scientists such as Dr. Hideki Yukawa, who won the Order of Culture last year, and his teacher Dr. Yoshio Nishina, are also burying themselves in research on the problem of atomic nuclei destruction.

Here is a brief explanation of the principle of destroying atomic nuclei. Elements such as hydrogen and oxygen are made of things called atoms, and atoms are formed by the nucleus and the electrons around it. The nucleus is composed of things called neutrons and things called protons. In other words, the substance that is extracted in pure form from the constituent elements of substances with the same chemical properties is called an atom. For example, the uranium nucleus with an atomic mass of 235 is synthesized from 92 protons and 143 neutrons, and 92 electrons surround its nucleus.

This kind of atomic nucleus was once considered unchanging, but the study of radioactivity has shown that atomic nuclei have the property of change, thus giving rise to the idea: "Can't these naturally mutated things be artificially destroyed?" This is the so-called "artificial destruction of atomic nuclei." Furthermore, because neutrons fly out from this destruction phenomenon, and these neutrons are used as atomic nuclei, a second destruction can occur. Therefore, it is believed that the so-called chain destruction is possible. However, this requires a huge device, so the research goals of atomic physicists in various countries are focused on discovering what kind of artificial radioactive substance can simply extract neutrons. In addition, not only is it limited to uranium, but thorium, an isotope element, can also be used, so the exploration of other heavy elements has also become a major issue in the field of atomic physics. Is the German V3 weapon a weapon for destroying atomic nuclei? Or is it a weapon that uses gunpowder with extremely strong destructive power that is beyond our common sense? At present, it is impossible to know for sure. (Translated from Mainichi Shimbun)

### Night Walk

— Liu Lin

At night, there are hardly any pedestrians on the streets. The light of the street lamps appears very bleak. Occasionally, a few rickshaws are parked on the side of the road, the drivers shrinking their bodies into balls, trying to find their last customer. There are also fruit stalls at the intersections; and vendors selling tofu and vermicelli. As soon as you turn a corner and look back, you can no longer see the flicker of the lamp, only the howling of the cold wind mixed with the persistent cries of the olive sellers.

The ground is very damp, and from time to time your feet will step into puddles – you only realize it when you hear the splashing sound of water under your feet. A thick fog spreads through the space. "It's going to be a rainy day tomorrow."

Walking at night is not a pleasant thing. Dragging a tired body, returning home alone at night, I am already used to this kind of life.

Walking slowly, letting the cold wind blow into my clothes. I slowly walk towards the dark depths.

Of course, I would rather lock myself in a narrow den; with a lonely lamp as a companion, I can read a few books, write some sporadic things, or reply to some letters from friends that I have received long ago. I would never think of those noisy, decadent places of pleasure, cafes, nightclubs, but I would think of a quiet life.

Walking slowly, sighing, silently. Looking at the sky, pitch black, unlikely to clear up. There isn't half a star in the dim sky.

I don't like stars, like some elves, they emit a seductive, dim light. It would be better if the blue and transparent sky was full of stars, I hate that the sky is only adorned with a few stars. Without stars, I won't be aroused by any fantasies. I don't want anything except that quiet life, that is not a suspended but a realistic thought. Away from home, that lonely and quiet life seems to give me some satisfaction. Finally, I don't even think about a quiet life, I don't think about anything.

"Why can't I enjoy this moment of quiet life?"

In this way, you will involuntarily be drawn to other thoughts: "Why?" You may even look back at the distant past or imagine the too-distant future! When you pull your thoughts back and think that you are groping alone in the darkness, you will feel the cold invading you. The strong wind not only penetrates your clothes, but also penetrates your heart.

The coldness is still the coldness, it will not increase or decrease for you, but why should I resent, grieve, and therefore feel the threat of coldness?

"Have a smoke." I thought. I am used to smoking one or two cigarettes on the way home at night, for no reason whatsoever. I feel that smoking is only appropriate in this situation. You will feel the intimacy of the cigarette, and at the same time it will not interfere with your work or harm your rest.

I took out a cigarette and lit it with great difficulty. I walked and smoked. Cigarettes don't give me any inspiration. I have never thought of extracting inspiration from the scent of cigarettes. I held the cigarette in my mouth, hiding the lit fire inside. When I smoked, I saw a glimmer of light. It cannot guide me, I still have to grope. Of course, I would never be ridiculous enough to use it to calculate time or distance. I know all this well, a forty-five-minute walk, from the wide, flat pavement to the shabby alley that is muddy all year round. Smoking, I still perceive that the moisture contained in the space tightly surrounds me. I cannot breathe freely. And I have to endure the cold even more; my heart is fiery, and I still feel that the heat inside me is dissipating towards the cold surroundings. "Even if I wear thicker clothes, it won't help."

"If I were a sick person, a person with a weak body, how could I live this kind of life."

"Don't think about it that way, I am a healthy person, and I am not a lonely person."

Finally, I didn't think about anything again.

I smoked.

I walked in silence.

### Warmth

— Ling Zuren

Friends! In a desolate life, to be able to obtain a sliver of "warmth" to cling to, how delighted would you be! And how much would it invigorate your life force! If you are a painter, then you will certainly be inspired to wield your brush with zeal; if you can sing, then surely your song will contain sweet juice. If you can write poetry and compose prose, then within them will be secretly hidden the secrets of your heart...

This is inevitable! Friends, isn't it? You believe it too.

Suppose you say that the people of the world are too selfish, too ugly, too base! And that it is practically impossible to find an object to entrust your "warmth" to. I can admit that you are right, but at the same time, I can deny that you are wrong. Because, in the past, I also used to think the same way as you, and I was firmly convinced that I was right! But, in recent times... I have found that my "confidence" is gradually wavering; at least from today onwards, I believe that there is definitely no absolute lack of "warmth" in all of humanity! The problem is – encounter!

You are smiling! You feel that what I said makes some sense, doesn't it? Then, light up a cigarette – no! A cigar would be better. And listen quietly.

For example, at this moment, perhaps you are leaning back in a soft sofa, slightly closing your eyes, leisurely blowing smoke rings, or perhaps you are drinking C.P.C. coffee, chewing peanuts or chocolate. But in your small room, there is only you, so quiet that even your own slight breathing can be clearly heard. Friends – have you ever thought, or even hoped, that there would be someone who could talk to you, by your side – gender is not an issue. Quietly listening to you say those "things you want to say" and slowly telling you those "things you like to hear," or perhaps you both love "art!" Then it would be even better to turn the topic to "art."

But, in fact, surrounding you are completely inexplicable and unsuitable people. You cannot find an ideal person worthy of entrusting your "warmth" to, so you are distressed, empty, silent...

In such a situation, I would sympathize with you. But; if you therefore assert that there is practically no decent person in humanity, then I would have to say that you are wrong.

I tell you, you don't have to confine yourself to a predetermined "small circle!" Outside the "small circle," there is also a "big" circle!

In the past, I really made the same mistake as you, but recently I have overturned that distorted theory myself.

Recently, my friends have all said that I have changed! As if I have completely transformed. Yes! Perhaps so – because I have overturned the theory I established before.

I believe! There is "warmth" in the world! – Hidden in every corner of the world, lonely friends! Search, excavate! It will make your desolate life become active and lively.

### The Story of Lamps

— Lan Yu

Small Words Before the Lamp

Striking a match, the pale yellow lamplight cuts through the desolate twilight, the twilight that is like sea mist, like the rising green smoke from the incense burner, and lets a thin layer of pale yellow fine net cover the quiet room.

Facing the lonely lamp, watching the slightly trembling light, I feel lonely.

Yes, it is loneliness gnawing at the painful heart of the solitary.

Listening to the streets gradually becoming silent, some footsteps walk slowly from far to near, and then from near to far. I know that this day is again embarking on its grueling journey, going to a distant and invisible place. – These endless days...

How should I spend this lonely night?

From time to time, I walk to the window, looking at the street lights outside the window, but the street lights are also silent, like some pale silent eyes.

Above them is the empty sky, without a moon, and without stars. – There is one, I know that it is the evening star.

I hope there is a guest visiting at night, a friend, or a traveler returning from afar. But there is none. Not even the sound of footsteps can be heard on the street. So I sit at the desk, propping my chin, before the lamp, in the silence... How should I spend this lonely night?

2 Watchman and Wind and Rain Lamp

I think of Ding Gui, a watchman in a small town, and his wind and rain lamp.

The desolate clapper sound rings in the dark night, and the watchman Gui comes from the deep alley. Every night, carrying the wind and rain lamp, like a diviner in the daytime, he walks from the long street to the deep alley, and from the deep alley to the long street, bringing a little sound to this small town. He asks about people's dreams, and also urges everyone in their more vague dreams, covered in stars and moon, to walk from the dark night to the dawn...

In my childhood, I had heard some stories about watchmen. One watchman finished eating wontons at a wonton stall on the street, and raised his head to pay, but suddenly saw the wonton seller taking his own head off his body and placing it on the carrying pole. Another watchman met a beautiful woman walking at night in a deep alley, and followed her in a daze into a luxurious mansion, but the next day he was found lying in a desolate graveyard...

Because of this, I felt a little mysterious about the watchman Ding Gui. Watchmen were originally considered mysterious; they are dreamers in the daytime, but elves at night.

"Aren't you afraid?" I asked him, one night, when the clapper sound knocked under my window.

"People who walk at night are not afraid of anything, sir," he replied quietly, "and I also have this."

He raised the wind and rain lamp.

"With it, I am not afraid of anything." He nodded to me and walked on his way.

The desolate clapper sound rang again.

3 Eternal Lamp

An eternal lamp lights up in my memory, the undying fire in the big temple outside my hometown city.

The eternal lamp is offered in front of the golden Buddha statue, and the monks in the temple say to every tourist:

"Since there has been this temple, the eternal lamp has never been extinguished. Countless people constantly send sesame oil to keep it burning forever, always going east."

"What if it goes out?" A child asked, not understanding.

"If it goes out," the monk's face suddenly became serious, "then the world will be in great chaos, and mankind will suffer a great calamity, in a daze, without daylight. We must never let it go out, never let it go out. Look, it has never gone out since ancient times, and it will never go out."

In fact, it has indeed never gone out, and without mentioning the distant past, just from the time I saw it, every time I went to that temple, the eternal lamp was always lit, and the hearts of the people in the small city were all lit by this eternal sacred fire. They felt that as long as the eternal lamp was lit, they would always have good days. Didn't the monks in that temple say, "The Bodhisattva has eyes"?

I have been away from my hometown for ten years, and I wish to send a piece of nostalgia to the returning wind. And with great sincerity, I bless the sacred fire in the hearts of the people in the small city, the eternal eternal lamp.

4 Lighthouse

My imagination flies to the seaside at night, where a lighthouse stands.

I should thank the first person to build a lighthouse, who silently protected and saved the lives of countless people. In children's books, there was a story about a lighthouse, how an old man and a young daughter fought back the attacks of the sea and the dark night with their weak strength in the waves and the deep night, and brought a ship of passengers back to the world from the hands of death.

When telling this story to the children, it aroused some sympathy, admiration, and excitement.

"What happened later?" The children habitually asked at the end of the story.

"There was nothing later," I said, "The rescued people returned to their hometowns one by one, leaving the father and daughter still in that lighthouse."

"Is there no one to accompany them?" Someone asked kindly, "There are only the father and daughter, how lonely!"

"Who accompanies them?" I replied, "And the people in the lighthouse are always lonely. The only thing that accompanies him is the lamp."

Dear sir, when you are traveling on the sea, watching the endless waves on the deck during the day, listening to music, dancing, and drinking coffee in the multi-story hall at night, and not feeling that the cruise ship you are on is continuing its voyage in the dark night, have you ever thought of the lighthouse silently helping you on the seaside, and the lonely night watchman inside the lighthouse?

5 Moth and Firefly

Beside the oil lamp on summer nights, there is often a beautiful silver-white moth, circling around the trembling lamplight.

The moth may have been resting in some invisible corner before, but seeing the lamplight, it flew from the darkness, circling around the pale yellow lamplight, flying, flying, flying closer.

Finally, with a hiss, the lamplight flickered, the moth struggled a few times with its burnt wings, and finally, had no strength, so it quietly lay in the lamp oil in the bowl, motionless, letting the oil soak through its silver-white wings and body.

Poor martyr! You flew to the lamplight full of enthusiasm and joy, but the lamplight destroyed you.

I also thought of another kind of hero of summer nights, the firefly. When I was young, I often begged adults to find a way to catch them and put them in a gauze bag, singing:

Big barley, small barley,
Fireflies fly down!
I won't hit you, I won't scold you,
I'll play with you and then let you go.

So the old man told me a story about someone using a firefly sac to read. – It was used as a lamp.

The moth longs for the lamplight, so it sacrifices itself in the fire, this is a beautiful story. But the firefly, what a tragic experience! It brings light to people, and even helps poor scholars to read in the summer night, but people trap it in a gauze bag, and it never sees that bit of light itself?

6 Epilogue

The dream has ended, and what accompanies me is still a dim lamp.

Some people say that the lamp is a symbol of light. But, sir, I am an ordinary person, and under this faint lamplight in front of me, I didn't think of these things. I have been sitting here for so long, I just feel that the sacred fire stolen by that Prometheus also ignited the warmth in my heart. Although it is lonely, there is a lamp accompanying me. I think of what the watchman Ding Gui in the small town said:

"With it, I am not afraid of anything."

Let me add some sesame oil, change a wick, and tell you the story of the light again...

### Rainy Night

— Fang Zheng

It was a rainy night, the torrential rain was pouring down outside the window, the room contained a humid and stuffy atmosphere, making people feel very uncomfortable, as if suffocating. A child of more than ten years old was sitting at the desk, reciting his book loudly; his grandfather - an old man with white hair - was leaning diagonally on the sofa beside the desk, a kind expression of quietly listening to the sound of reading piled on his amiable old face.

"The world has people without mothers, Heaven, how painful!" The sound of reading stopped abruptly here. The old man seemed to be somewhat lost in thought, and sighed a long sigh.

"Grandpa! I have finished my homework, can your story start now?" the child said, moving his chair closer to the old man.

"Story? What story?" the old man was a little absent-minded.

"Grandpa! You tell me stories at this time every day, how could you forget today?" the child added.

"Um... story! Good! Let's take it as a story... Child! Don't forget this story after you hear it, you should keep it in your heart forever, deep in your heart!" the old man answered to himself as if suddenly realizing.

"Why? Grandpa!" the child asked curiously.

"This is because... oh! Listen to me! Don't interrupt."

Ten years ago, it was such a rainy night, a story happened in this house. The old man was still sitting on the sofa, but in front of him was not the child, but the child's father, a middle-aged man who was addicted to romance. The old man said angrily:

"Are you here to be a lobbyist for her? Don't even think about it!" He stood up abruptly: "You have to know that she is suffering from tuberculosis, which is contagious, especially to children. Wouldn't it be too dangerous if we didn't isolate her? Besides, she is just your concubine, is it worth paying so much attention to?"

"Dad! She just wants to see the child one last time, she will die in peace. Please... please..."

"Don't babble anymore, go away!" the old man dragged the middle-aged man away and left on his own.

"Alas! Meeting such a stubborn father is really embarrassing..." the middle-aged man ran out with a mournful face, unaware of the wind and rain.

Late at night, the rain was getting heavier. In the hospital ward, a dying sick woman was lying down. The middle-aged man walked to the edge of the bed and lowered his head, leaning against her haggard face and said:

"Wen! Please forgive me, Dad won't allow it, he hid the child, I can't find him, I told him, but he doesn't listen -" The sick woman opened her weak eyes in annoyance, staring at the middle-aged man for a moment, then her dry lips opened and moved, as if she wanted to speak, but couldn't make a sound - finally, she choked and died, her left eye still not closed!

"Wen! What's wrong with you! Why don't you speak? Why..." the middle-aged man shook the sick woman's body frantically, crying and shouting loudly. Finally, he was half-deceived and dragged out of the ward by the nurses and hospital servants.

From then on, the middle-aged man was sent to a mental hospital, and soon followed his beloved companion.

"Now only that child without parents is left, pitifully living with his old grandfather! It's me - no! It's that old man who is bad, why didn't he let the mother and son see each other for the last time?" the old man said, sadly expressing his personal after the "story."

"Then! Grandpa, is my mother that poor sick woman?" It was the child's question.

"…………" The old man couldn't answer anymore, two tearful beads suddenly hung on his old and thin face, was it sorrow? Or repentance?

### To Friends Who Are About to Graduate

— Yuan Ying

People in the world often like to regret. Li Si, the prime minister of the great Qin Dynasty, still missed a rabbit he hunted when he was dying in the market of Xianyang. George Bernard Shaw thought that people must first jump to the end of life and then turn back to savor it, but it is actually just a joke. And you, when you are about to wear a square hat, you are also thinking of "going back to savor the joy of freshman year in college", which is certainly good, but what is the use of regret? What's more, even if you were to be a Freshman again now, what would you do? I want to ask again, what's the use of regret?

It is true that the old saying "graduation means unemployment" "still has its power", and "what you learn is not what you use" is not only your friend C.H.W.T.L… Many Sorens are suffering and worrying about this shadow. Tens of thousands of college graduates are also regretting why they took those courses that are completely unrelated to their current profession. And tens of thousands of Freshmen Sophomores Joniers are about to embark on this muddy road. It's not just you who feel gloomy.

For this reason, you should take this as everyone's business.

However, everyone sometimes does not think of these things, which means that there are still some beautiful dreams in front of people. For these dreams, they do not hesitate to exchange a lot of money, time, and energy for a diploma; a hat, and a title. Although they know that it is a dream, they still want to do it, which means that when there is no other way, dreaming is also good.

Lu Xun said in "What Happens After Nora Leaves" that if there is no way, it is better to let people continue to dream, don't wake them up, because the pain of returning from dreams to reality is greater. And you, you woke up those who were immersed in dreams, but after waking up, there is no way to go, and everyone you bump into is suffering the same fate, so those who did not have pain begin to discover pain, and those who already have pain are even more painful.

However, this does not mean that you should be willing to dream, or that you should advise people not to face the bloody reality. Facing reality is still necessary and most important, and now, who can know what you will encounter when you graduate, or what kind of world it will be. We don't even know if we will get household registration tomorrow, why think so far?

This does not mean that "the boat will naturally go straight when it reaches the bridge", or that you should muddle through one day at a time, but that it is really useless to think too much. As mentioned earlier, this is not your business alone, it is everyone's business, it is a very big problem. We can't solve it with our little strength. Just like you, you raised such a problem, which can be regarded as a call to people, but how much of our society can this change?

Our society is such a society. Before it is thoroughly reformed, even if one-tenth of college graduates use their "knowledge", even - let's have another even - every graduate finds his job, you say, how much of a role can it play in such a society?

To say it again, this is originally everyone's business.

Therefore, now, worry and pain are superfluous, it is better to be at ease in your own position!

### Commentary on the Sino-Northern China United University Match

Due to venue constraints, the third annual basketball league urgently needs to conclude within the month. Therefore, matches have been held daily recently, making it an extremely busy time. Currently, the only remaining Group A match is between Sino-Northern China and United University. The makeup game from their first round was held yesterday at 6 PM in the old Western Youth basketball court. Given the difficulty in maintaining order, the authorities, in order to limit the audience, temporarily increased ticket prices to 500 yuan upstairs and 2,000 yuan downstairs, and also limited the number of tickets available. However, the high prices did not deter the fans, and all tickets were sold out. It is estimated that over a thousand people were left disappointed. This shows the immense appeal of the match. Since the number of tickets was strictly limited, the venue was not overcrowded, with every seat filled and no empty spaces, creating a truly standard atmosphere. We will first list the current standings for the group, and then describe yesterday's game and provide commentary:

Looking at the standings above, Sino-Northern China's victory over United University yesterday allowed them to take sole possession of first place. They will face each other again in the second round, giving United University another chance. Sino-Northern China is the only Northern-style team in Shanghai, while United University has enjoyed a strong reputation in the basketball world for years. Yesterday's match also yielded a most satisfying result. Therefore, we will detail the process of this exciting North-South battle below.

Referee Liu Hesheng and Yang Liecheng invited both team captains, Wang Zhongtao and Kong Guangyi, to shake hands as a gesture of respect. After determining positions, the jump ball was held at center court. The starting lineups for both teams were as follows:

Botte (United University Forward) Qu Xilin (United University Guard)

Li Zhenzhong (Sino-Northern China Guard) Shen Gong (Sino-Northern China)

Wu Chengzhang (United University Forward)

Chen Xuechong (Sino-Northern China Forward)

Xu Jusheng (United University Forward) Zhang Kangxiong (United University Guard)

Zhuo Guorong (Sino-Northern China Guard) Zhao Yalin (Sino-Northern China Forward)

Showcasing Skill, Achieving Ideal Results

First Half

Both sides adopted a man-to-man defense, resulting in the above matchups. Zhenzhong tried first but missed. Xilin's long shot also missed. Xuechong tricked his way into the center and scored with a reverse shot. Chengzhang committed a foul, Xuechong missed both free throws, and Sino-Northern China opened the scoring. They attacked again, Xuechong used the same tactic, Chengzhang fouled again, and both free throws missed. Lingzhong darted in but was stopped by Liangxiong, who committed a holding foul. Zhenzhong made one free throw, making it 3-0. At this point, both sides became extremely chaotic, and Sino-Northern China called a timeout. United University also took the opportunity to substitute Wu Chengzhang with Fan Qinggong, who guarded Zhao Yalin, while Liangxiong guarded Xuechong – this was United University's planned strategy. Botte fouled again, Zhenzhong scored another free throw, making it 4-0. Liangxiong made two wild shots, and United University urgently called a timeout to calm down. Sure enough, Jusheng scored two free throws after Zhuo committed a foul, and then made a long shot, tying the score at 4-4. This was the only time the score was tied in yesterday's game. Afterwards, Sino-Northern China suddenly became more active. A-Che made a left-handed shot, boosting their morale, and they quickly added five points. United University then substituted Kong Guangyi for Qinggong, hoping to use his aggressiveness to compete with Yalin. However, they still couldn't stop Sino-Northern China's score from rising rapidly, from 12-5 to 17-9. By the end of the first half, Zhuo committed a foul, and Botte scored on the free throw, making the score 19-12 in favor of Sino-Northern China, a lead of seven points.

Second Half

During the break, Wang Zhongtao and Zhang Xiang each imparted their strategic advice, full of confidence. When they resumed play, the situation remained the same. Xuechong pretended to take a shot, but at this time, Jusheng became very active, causing Zhuo to commit numerous fouls. When Sino-Northern China led 25-14, Zhuo was ejected with four fouls and replaced by Bao Songyuan. United University took advantage of the opponent's unsteady formation, with Jusheng and Botte excelling on both sides, quickly closing the gap to 25-21, only two baskets behind. Sino-Northern China had to call another timeout to suppress the momentum. At this time, both sides exerted their full skills, creating a tense atmosphere. The score became 27-22. Yalin was replaced by Li Baozhong, putting them in a difficult battle. With seven minutes left, when United University trailed 29-25, Liangxiong and Xilin missed four easy shots, and Xuechong scored on a reverse shot, solidifying the outcome of the game. It seemed to be fate. In the end, Sino-Northern China won by a score of 32-28, defeating United University by two baskets. Sino-Northern China was successful, and United University, despite the loss, played with honor. Attached are the score sheets for both teams:

### Both Teams Showed Success, Both Adopted Man-to-Man Defense

We should not judge heroes by success or failure. Looking at the entire game process of both teams yesterday, they both showed development in basketball skills. This alone is a success. The reasons why Sino-Northern China was able to win are: first, experience, and second, skillful management. Therefore, the importance of guidance is no less than that of the soldiers on the front line. Using Zhuo to guard Jusheng was a wise move. Although Bao Songyuan has excellent skills, he is bound to make mistakes against the lively Jusheng. This was evident after Zhuo was fouled out. The greatest contributors to Sino-Northern China's success were Zhenzhong and Xuechong. The former remained the soul of the team, connecting offense and defense, which was very beneficial. Although Xuechong made many erratic shots, his reverse shots in the center forced defenders to foul, which was truly intimidating to the opponent. In addition, the team's tall stature allowed them to gain many rebounds under the basket, which meant more offensive opportunities. More offensive opportunities naturally lead to a greater chance of victory, which is a major reason why Sino-Northern China won.

The biggest reasons for United University's loss yesterday were losing too many points in the first half and Zhang Liangxiong's excessive nervousness. Zhang is also considered a contributing member. He had many shooting opportunities yesterday, but unfortunately, he was too hasty, and the shots always bounced out. If he could have calmed down a bit, his scoring would have improved. Botte was more than capable on offense, but lacked in defense, and committed many unnecessary fouls, perhaps because he was not familiar with Zhenzhong's playing style. Xilin claimed to have been quite successful in guarding Qungong, but he was also marked closely by Qungong, preventing him from attempting long shots. Overall, his contributions were more positive than negative. Qungong was also a major scorer for Sino-Northern China. United University lost yesterday, but their performance was highly ideal and can be considered a success.

Regarding the tactics of both teams, they both adopted a man-to-man defense, closely guarding their assigned player and never letting up, fulfilling their responsibilities. The view was excellent. However, I felt that they rarely utilized screens and switches, which would have made for a more beautiful scene. Sticking to a man too tightly is tiring, and a slight positional error can create a gap. At necessary times and depending on the position, they should have switched defenders. In this first match, Sino-Northern China achieved their goal. Next time they meet, United University will surely make new improvements to seek revenge, while Sino-Northern China will continue their efforts to win the championship without a doubt. The prediction is that it will be even more captivating.

### Sideline Notes

Dai Changling and Zhang Xiang chatted and laughed casually, showing no signs of tension, indicating their experience as coaches.

Li Zhenzhong and Chen Xuechong's wives, along with Green Team's Huang Mingyuan, sat in a corner and made many insightful comments about the game.

The order was excellent yesterday. The increased ticket prices were an effective measure, with no jeering and only cheers, which is a good phenomenon.

Shen Yugong's brother, Shen Yuqin, was extremely attentive, constantly running around and asking questions.

The upstairs was filled with knowledgeable fans, while the downstairs was mostly players and sports figures.

Pan Sansheng, a key figure in the Three Provinces Women's Basketball Team, is enthusiastic about promoting the sport. This year, they again extended an invitation to Chen Zuoliang to be their coach, and their skills are improving daily. In the third annual league, they could win the second place. Apart from the Green Team, they can claim dominance. With further effort, they have great potential. The players who have improved the most are the Chen Meizhen and Chen Liuzhen sisters, as well as Le Jiabao and Lu Cuifang. Below is a group photo of the entire Three Provinces team.

### Essentials of Basketball Theory (12)

— Liang Zhao'an

(E) Other Basic Individual Offensive Techniques

In addition to catching, passing, shooting, and dribbling, which are the main basic movements in basketball, there are other very important movements such as starting, stopping, pivoting, blocking, and feinting. In a game, in addition to a courageous and fierce fighting spirit, it is even more important to have the talent to use these basic movements. Players with talent can easily achieve mastery. However, even those who lack talent can still aspire to excellence if they constantly study and diligently practice various basic techniques. Therefore, the following basic movements are essential to pay attention to and master.

(1) Starting – A player who can start (i.e., run) quickly can often attack the opponent unprepared and evade the enemy's tight defense. Passing and shooting also become more agile, and movements feel more alert. It is common to see players miss opportunities due to slow starts, making them easily watched. The correct starting posture involves the feet being staggered, about one foot apart, with the distance between them being the same width as the shoulders. The body should be slightly bent forward, with the head looking forward. Both arms should be bent forward, and the body should be balanced, with the center of gravity slightly on the front or back foot, ready to start at any time. (2) Stopping

Being able to start quickly requires being able to stop quickly, in order to respond quickly and freely amidst a fierce battle, especially when holding the ball. There are two ways to stop. One is to stop while sprinting. When wanting to stop, the body should jump slightly, lifting both feet off the ground together. Then, the front sole of the foot should gently touch the ground, and the knee should be bent to stop, with the body slightly bent forward. If holding the ball, it should be placed in the abdomen for pivoting, passing, or shooting. The other is the normal stopping method, which involves taking a step forward with the front foot when wanting to stop while moving, while bending the rear foot slightly to support the body weight. The ball, when held in the hand, must be placed in the abdomen for protection. If you want to pivot after stopping, you must move the front foot to avoid committing the violation of traveling. These two stopping methods can be practiced in combination with walking, pivoting, and jumping.

(3) Pivoting – Pivoting and dribbling can be said to be the most wonderful movements in basketball. These two movements are not naturally occurring, but were invented through the thinking of many past coaches and clever players. After training these two movements to maturity, basketball offensive techniques suddenly changed, no longer as rigid as before.

### Gleanings from the Sports Scene

The championship final in the Group A and B basketball league between Sino-Northern China B and Donghua ended unfortunately when Donghua protested a free throw and refused to play, before the game could finish. Donghua has now filed a formal protest, and it remains to be seen how the council will handle it.

Basketball referee Zhou Huaibang always gets plenty of rest before performing his duties, which is a necessary condition for a referee.

Miss Chen Meizhen, captain of the Three Provinces Women's Basketball Team, attends and judges every soccer match without fail, which shows her interest in ball sports.

Team Fatty Yan Youling enjoys alcohol and has a large capacity, making him difficult to get drunk. However, once drunk, Youling is bound to cause trouble.

Green Team secretary Wang Wangqian has almost no interest in sports, perhaps because he has other new developments and no time for it?

Li Yichen had a slight misunderstanding with the friendly authorities, causing him to miss several matches. It has been learned that he has been transferred and should be able to play soon. (End)
