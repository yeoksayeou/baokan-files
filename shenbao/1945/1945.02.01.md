Summary of the Admonition

Nanjing, January 31st (Central News Agency) – Minister Chen yesterday gave an admonition to all military, gendarmerie, police officers, soldiers, staff, commanders and police officers stationed in the capital, the main points of which are as follows:

The significance of convening you all today will be explained in detail by Minister Ye. The process of establishing this Price Stabilization and Discipline Committee for Materials, and the measures to maintain the livelihood of the military, gendarmerie, and police officers and soldiers in the future, will be elaborated upon. Now, I will first clarify my personal feelings to you all.

Over the past year, discipline within the military and police has been relatively lax. At the same time, we also know that the lives of the military and police have become more and more difficult. In order to improve the lives of the military and police and maintain their discipline, the central leaders have considered and established the Price Stabilization and Discipline Committee for Materials. There are two points of view on the establishment of the Price Stabilization and Discipline Committee: First, starting from the capital and spreading to the whole country, we hope that everyone will break through the difficulties of reality with lofty ideals. Second, regarding the future of improving the lives of the military and police in the capital, although obstacles are inevitable, we should find ways to remove them. We must first solve the difficulties in the capital, and then solve the difficulties in other places. This is the reason and motivation for the establishment of the Capital's Price Stabilization and Discipline Committee for Materials. As for various measures to improve the treatment of the military and police, in order to alleviate the difficulties in the lives of the military and police in the capital, additional living subsidies will be provided. I hope that you can understand the government's painstaking efforts and not loosen military discipline under the pretext of livelihood problems in the future. Since we are doing our best to solve your difficulties, we also hope that you will give the government your full cooperation. If there are any illegal incidents involving subordinates in the future, it will not only be the responsibility of the soldiers, but the officers will also bear considerable responsibility. Officers should examine themselves and be models for their soldiers. We can ignore the past, but we must make thorough efforts in the future. When officers are strict and upright, soldiers will know what to fear. If officers are not disciplined, soldiers will become even more unbridled. Therefore, I hope that officers will have a spirit of reflection, supervise their subordinates, and work together to create a great cause that benefits the country and the people. The government has such painstaking efforts and is planning for you. I hope that you can also plan for the country and the nation, establish a new model, and promote it from the capital to the whole country. Finally, I hope that after listening to my words, you can muster the courage to complete the important task of defending the country and revitalizing China.

### Admiral Toyoda Discusses Japanese Steel Production

Tokyo, January 31st (Central News Agency) – Admiral Teijiro Toyoda, President of the Japan Iron & Steel Co., Ltd., gave a speech at the Kyushu plant of the company on the afternoon of the 31st, as follows: Steel determines the course of war, therefore we must secure it. Some citizens point out that the import of ore and maritime transport are difficult. Although this is a cause for concern, various countermeasures have already been taken. For example, special steel is based on military requirements, and in addition to quality, importance is also attached to production. Regarding this point, the people can rest assured. Looking at the thorough mobilization and arduous struggle in Germany, we can see that Japan still has ample room for improvement. Thanks to the efforts of technical work, the future of steel production is not pessimistic. Special steel, which is necessary for the increased production of new aircraft, will be maintained to the best of our ability, regardless of the situation.

### The Decisive Battle Stage in Luzon is Becoming Increasingly Imminent; Japanese Troops are Confronting the Enemy in Leyte

Tokyo, January 31st (Central News Agency) – The enemy troops that have arrived in the Lingayen Gulf area have reached six or seven divisions and two tank divisions, and have advanced as far as one hundred kilometers south, attempting to invade the Manila area. Today, the Japanese army seems to be still silent, but once the Japanese army rises up, the decisive battle will begin, and Japanese naval vessels will also launch attacks at the same time as the air force. Considering that the Japanese Combined Fleet, which has been enduring and enduring, once leaves the string, it will reap the magnificent results of the air battle in the Taiwan Sea and the naval battle in the Philippine Sea. It is only by enduring and enduring that we can finally seize the divine opportunity and respond to the Philippine battlefield, and rise up bravely. It is most anticipated that the navy with large cannons and giant ships in modern warfare has changed its appearance, and only the large aviation fleet leading the elite air force is the true form of the Japanese navy that people are expecting.

Luzon Front, January 31st (Central News Agency) – According to information from a certain base, the enemy in Luzon moved toward central Luzon from the Agno River area on the 20th. The force was approximately two divisions of the Wacka [sic] units. One division was in the Clark Field area, and the other was in the Rozales, sixteen kilometers southeast of Pinaronan [sic], and the Taguig area, ten kilometers east of Asingan, began to move. The former aimed to attack the Clark Air Base, and the latter attempted to cut off the road between Cabanatuan and Bataan. By the evening of the 28th, the enemy in the Clark area, on the Banshan Flying Station [sic], was repelled by the Japanese army, and progress was no longer possible. On the central highway, the vanguard troops advancing into Cabanatuan had already retreated due to the same attack by the Japanese army, but there was still a tendency to increase troops and try to attack again.

Philippine Front Base, January 31st (Central News Agency) – The Japanese air force continued to attack the enemy forces in the Lingayen Gulf area on the night of the 28th, destroying the enemy airfield in San Fabian, and setting fire to two large transport ships.

Philippine Front, January 31st (Central News Agency) – On Leyte Island in the Philippines, more than eighty days have passed since the start of the decisive battle. The enemy is now launching the Luzon operation, with the goal of occupying the capital, Manila. According to the fierce fighting situation here, it can be seen that the decisive battle stage is becoming increasingly imminent. Regarding the battle situation in Leyte, the two sides were later caught in a complicated situation. Currently, the Japanese army is deploying on a certain key line, confronting the enemy. The enemy's operation is also extremely difficult. Their supply relies only on small ships and transport aircraft, so it is difficult to carry out large-scale attacks. On the other hand, the Japanese army's charge tactics have caused the enemy to bleed a lot. However, the Japanese army has gained some operational lessons in Leyte Island. One is the difficulty of mobile operations. Japanese commanders and soldiers are engaged in mountain individual battles on foot. The second is that in addition to malaria, vegetable seeds must be used to solve the problem of food self-sufficiency. The third is the rampant banditry. Enemy aircraft often disperse weapons, food, medicines, leaflets, etc., among bandit mid-level personnel to invade the Japanese army's front lines. In this environment, the Japanese army is able to overcome difficulties. In addition to persisting, it also uses commando attacks, frequently threatening enemy airfields such as Tacloban. According to the Battle of Leyte, although it was an external reverse attack of the Japanese army in terms of operations, when the Luzon battle is fiercely unfolding with Manila as the axis, being able to hold Leyte and implement preemptive attacks is a full display of the great power of the Japanese army.

Editorial

### A Bird's-Eye View of the European Eastern Front

In the past half-month or so, the Western European front has been calm and uneventful, while the Eastern front has undergone tremendous changes. If we consider the situation when the Soviet army began its offensive (the 12th of this month), the expansion and contraction of the two sides' front lines have exceeded 250 kilometers. This is the second largest change in the war after the "Battle of France", and it is worth our attention. Therefore, we will make a list of the Eastern Front as follows:

This winter offensive launched by the Soviet army on the Eastern Front stretches nearly 1,000 kilometers, starting from East Prussia in the north, passing through the entire territory of Poland and a corner of Germany's southeastern homeland, and extending to the old territory of Czechoslovakia and Hungary in the south. The main battlefields can be roughly divided into three: one is the northern battlefield centered on East Prussia, the second is the central battlefield centered on Bromberg and Posen, and the third is the southern battlefield centered on the upper reaches of the Oder River in Germany's southeastern homeland. The changes in these three battlefields in the past ten days or so can be roughly described as follows:

Northern Battlefield The outbreak of the war in the Northern Battlefield began with the offensive launched by the Soviet army on the 12th of this month. The Soviet army's offensive in this battlefield can be divided into two routes, north and south. The main force in the north is the Third Belorussian Front, commanded by General Chernyakhovsky. The main force in the south is the Second Belorussian Front, commanded by Marshal Rokossovsky. The northern offensive is divided into left and right wings. The left wing (located east of the eastern border of East Prussia) began its offensive on the 12th of the month. On that day, the Soviet army broke through the eastern border of East Prussia along the Kaunas-Konigsberg railway, and the army pointed to Insterburg. At the same time, another unit waiting in the northern border of East Prussia, the right-wing army, also began to cooperate: on the 20th, it broke through Tilsit, the key point of the northern border of East Prussia, and on the 22nd, it occupied Insterburg along the Tilsit-Insterburg railway. Since then, the left and right wing units have joined forces and advanced along the coastline towards Konigsberg, echoing the southern offensive that will be described in the next paragraph. At present, the war on this route has extended to the vicinity of Konigsberg. Looking at the overall situation, the German army seems to be shortening its front line here.

The southern offensive of the Northern Battlefield can also be divided into two wings: one is the feint on the southeast of East Prussia, and the other is the left wing waiting on the north bank of the Narew River north of Warsaw. This is the Second Belorussian Front. The former is a feint, while the latter is the main force. When the aforementioned northern offensive was launched on the 12th of this month, the southern feinting side (right wing) also took action, but there was no significant progress. Reports commented that this was limited by geographical conditions (the area is a lake swamp area), but in fact, the operation in this area was only a feint in nature and had no in-depth purpose. Two days later, the left wing began to dispatch the main force, and its direction of attack was to advance along the Warsaw-Danzig railway. On the 20th and 21st of this month, this main force broke through the southern border line of East Prussia, swept through the old battlefield of Tannenberg in the last war, and attempted to advance north along this route to cut off the connection between the entire East Prussia and the German mainland. According to recent telegraphs, a fast unit of the Soviet army has already arrived near Danzig, and this attempt can be considered to have been largely completed. According to German reports, the forces used by both sides in the Northern Battlefield were about 150 Soviet divisions, while the German forces were estimated by the British and Americans to be only 12 to 20 divisions. The absolute superiority of the Soviet forces is very obvious. And why the war situation has evolved to this point, the sequel can also understand.

Central Battlefield The main force used by the Soviet army on the Central Battlefield is the First Belorussian Front, led by Marshal Zhukov, the authority on modern tank warfare. The Soviet army's offensive base on this battlefield is the area west of the Vistula River south of Warsaw. At the beginning of the offensive, on the 14th of this month, the right wing of the Soviet army on this battlefield broke into the rear of Poznan in one fell swoop, forcing the German army to quickly abandon Warsaw. At the same time, the unit on this wing quickly advanced west along the Vistula River and occupied Bromberg, the key point connecting East Prussia and the German mainland, on the 27th, which changed the entire situation on the central battlefield. In addition, the left wing of this battlefield, in the process of completing the above-mentioned actions by the right-wing unit, advanced westward with the entire division, crossed the Warta River, and approached Posen, causing the midpoint connecting Warsaw and Berlin to fall into the hands of the Soviet army in one fell swoop. The war in this area can be regarded as the center of the Eastern Front, because it is the closest to Berlin and because this is a plain area suitable for a decisive battle between the two sides. It is expected that both Germany and the Soviet Union will throw their main forces here to determine the outcome.

Southern Battlefield The Soviet army's offensive in the Southern Battlefield also began on the 12th, and its offensive base was the large bend of the Vistula River. Its target was the Upper Silesia industrial area of Germany. The Soviet army's forces on this battlefield can also be divided into left and right wings. In order to echo the actions of the left wing of the Central Battlefield, the right wing army advanced to the northwest at the beginning of the offensive, and entered Lodz in one fell swoop. After completing the mission, it pointed its troops west and entered Silesia on the 21st, pointing to Breslau, an important town in Silesia. At present, part of the forces of this unit has already crossed the Oder River and is fighting fiercely with the German army. Another unit, the left wing army of the Soviet army in this battlefield, also broke through Cracow, a large city in southwestern Poland, on the 19th, and then broke through the southeastern border of Germany and occupied Katovitse, its key point. At present, the Soviet offensive in this area is also in full swing, because the Soviet army wants to join forces with the right wing army in this battlefield to capture and eliminate the German army in Silesia, and on the other hand, it hopes to maintain a north-south echo with the First Ukrainian Front under the command of Marshal Konev in Hungary, in order to attack the German forces in Czechoslovakia.

The above is a brief description of the winter offensive launched by the Soviet army on the 12th of this month. If we want to infer the strategic trend of the Eastern Front in the future based on the above-mentioned war situation, the following points are willing to be pointed out:

First, in terms of the three battlefields on the entire front, the most noteworthy in the future is of course the Central Battlefield. Because it is the closest to the political center of Germany, if the battlefield gradually moves westward, the impact of the changes in the war situation on the European situation may be very large. Secondly, the importance of the Southern Battlefield is only second to the Central Battlefield, because Silesia is an important industrial area in Germany. If this area falls into the hands of the Soviet army, the German combat supply capacity will be greatly affected. As for the Northern Battlefield, although the fate of East Prussia has been largely decided, this is not closely related to the overall situation, so its importance is worse.

Second, judging from the Soviet army's war situation in the past ten days or so, it should not be underestimated, and further inferring the future, it can be foreseen that the German army will continue to encounter many difficulties, but if it is therefore believed that the war situation will take a sharp turn for the worse, that is too rash.

Third, the battle lines of the German troops in various battlefields have now been shortened to the vicinity of the national border. Although this is the result of the shift in the war situation, it is somewhat beneficial to the German army: because it can lengthen the opponent's supply line and shorten its own supply line. Moreover, it is easier to obtain the cooperation of the people when the war is carried out within the country. From this point of view, the German army will deploy a large decisive battle near its own border in order to shift the entire war situation. How this decisive battle will unfold, let us wait and see.

### Japanese General Headquarters Announces Results of the Palembang Area Counterattack: 90 Enemy Aircraft Shot Down; Imperial Shield Squad Attacks British Task Force

Tokyo, January 31st (Central News Agency) – The Japanese General Headquarters announced at 3:30 PM on January 31st: On January 29th, a total of 130 aircraft from an enemy task force attacked the Palembang area of Sumatra Island. The local Japanese army's aviation and land forces counterattacked, shooting down 40 aircraft and inflicting damage on about 50 aircraft. Damage to land facilities was slight. The Japanese Special Attack Unit, the Imperial Shield Flying Squadron, attacked the enemy task force at approximately 2:00 PM that afternoon. The results are still unclear. The Japanese side lost 12 aircraft due to self-detonation and non-return.

Tokyo, January 31st (Central News Agency) – The British task force, in order to respond to the Philippine battle and the related Burmese operation, has gradually made its movements clear. It appeared in the southwestern waters of Sumatra Island on the 24th and bombed Palembang with 140 carrier-based aircraft. After the Japanese army's land and air forces jointly counterattacked, 114 aircraft were shot down and retreated. On the 29th, a task force with two aircraft carriers as the main force attacked Palembang three times with 130 carrier-based aircraft from 10:00 AM. After the brave counterattack by the Japanese air force and ground forces, they retreated. As a result, 40 aircraft were shot down and 50 aircraft were heavily damaged, for a total of 90 aircraft damaged. Among the 40 aircraft shot down, some were restrained by the Japanese army's obstruction balloon net and shot down. Moreover, due to the brave counterattack of the Japanese air control unit, the damage on the ground was extremely small. When the news of the appearance of the British task force reached the Japanese army's position, the Japanese reconnaissance aircraft first went out to search and found the enemy. The Japanese Special Attack Unit, the Imperial Shield Flying Squadron, immediately followed and counterattacked. At approximately 4:00 PM on the 29th, the Japanese healthy aircraft made a heroic collision, and before the collision, the commander's aircraft and its僚機 continued to send communications of colliding and covering each other, from which it can be seen the magnificent columns of the operation at that time. Since the reconnaissance aircraft has not yet returned, the results of the battle cannot be determined, but it is imagined that the results will be extremely great. In this fierce battle and attack on the enemy task force, 12 aircraft were lost. The British task force launched a containment operation in order to respond to the Philippine battle, and was severely attacked by the Japanese army, so most of its carrier-based aircraft have been lost.

### Minister of Finance Ishiwatari Explains Japanese Financial Policy

### The Mystery of the Location of the Three-Headed Conference

Stockholm, Sweden, January 31st (Central News Agency) – German News Agency, London dispatch: The location of the Roosevelt Conference is still kept secret. However, London political figures expressed their opinion that in view of the current large-scale offensive launched by the Soviet army, the meeting will probably be held in a place where Stalin can maintain contact with the Soviet military command.

Lisbon, January 31st (Central News Agency) – German News Agency, Washington dispatch: President Roosevelt celebrated his 63rd birthday today. His whereabouts have not been announced. It is not known whether he will spend his birthday as usual, but his wife will represent him in reading a broadcast address to the public.

### The Western Front Containment Offensive Has No Changes in the War Situation

Berlin, January 31st (Haito News Agency) – The British and American forces on the Western Front seem to be strengthening their offensive activities. Eisenhower seems to want to show the Soviet Union the intention of the anti-Axis forces to contain the German forces in order to prevent the German forces from being transferred from the Western Front to the Eastern Front. In fact, the German forces do not need to transfer reserve forces. The British Second Army's offensive in the triangle area of the Meuse River and the Ruhr River intends to expand to the southeast. The US First Army is strengthening its pressure in the border area of Germany, Belgium, and Luxembourg. The US Third Army has made little progress toward Białystok. There are no changes in Lower Alsace. The French and American forces attacked the northern wing of the German bridgehead in Upper Alsace and moved slightly toward the Rhine-Rhone Canal.

### Yagi, President of the Japanese Institute of Technology, Encourages the German People to Discuss the War Situation from the Standpoint of a Scientist

Tokyo, January 31st, Central News Agency Telegram: Dr. Yagi, President of the Japanese Institute of Technology, recently delivered a speech from the standpoint of a scientist to encourage the German people. The gist of his speech was that before harboring pessimistic views on the German-Soviet war situation, people should change their perspective and observe the battle in which German forces surrounded Moscow. Because Soviet forces were able to cope with the fierce German attacks, they were ultimately able to reverse the crisis. Now, suppose the German forces continue to retreat to Berlin and engage in fierce street fighting. In that case, the Soviet forces will inevitably encounter difficulties such as excessively long supply lines and difficulty in maintaining order. This situation is exactly the same as when the German forces surrounded Moscow. The German forces have already dispersed military factories around Berlin to the rear, and military production capacity remains as usual, allowing for a long-term war of resistance. The German forces will use Berlin as their last defensive wall, and once the opportunity arrives, they will launch a major offensive. Furthermore, Germany has the strong leadership of Führer Hitler, and the people also have absolute confidence in him. Today is the time for the entire German people to directly participate in the war. Germany's world-renowned V-shaped weapons are excellent scientific weapons. They are not unprecedented inventions but merely the early realization of generally conceived scientific ideas. If these weapons can be mass-produced, victory in the war can be achieved. I believe that Germany will definitely be able to mass-produce these excellent scientific weapons in the future. German citizens, do not worry about the future of the war; final victory will surely belong to Germany.

### For the Sake of National Survival, Determined to Fight to the End: Führer Hitler Delivers a Speech

Berlin, January 31st, Central Telegram: German News Agency: Yesterday was the twelfth anniversary of the National Socialist Party's rule. Führer Hitler delivered a speech that evening. The main points are as follows: "Twelve years ago, when the late President Hindenburg appointed me as Chancellor, the internal and international political situation in Germany was no different from today. After the failure of 1918, the old order has been destroyed. Those who attempt to preserve it will inevitably fail, and nations of the middle class will be eliminated. Only a consolidated and united nation can withstand the greatest crisis that Europe has experienced for many centuries. In the great social and cultural construction, especially in education, National Socialism has provided the German people with equipment that can be transformed into military assets. Since January 30, 1933, we have only gained six years of peace. During these six years, we have completed a huge amount of work, and the most important thing is that during these six years, we have made the German people full of the spirit and will to survive independently. Today, we will overcome the terrible fate that is afflicting the East, regardless of all the hardships and setbacks. If we can do so, it is only because the German people have been completely reformed internally since 1933. Before National Socialism came to power, it had launched an arduous struggle against Jewish Bolshevism. The reason why Bolshevism failed to ravage Europe in 1919 and 1920 was because it was too weak and not sufficiently armed at the time. Therefore, the Jews implemented their plan to disintegrate us internally, and the ignorant fools who did not realize that the world of the middle class had come to an end were the best allies of the Jews. If Europe is suffering from a serious disease today, then the countries afflicted by this disease will be destroyed if they cannot overcome it. Therefore, our firm will is to struggle to preserve our nation from this most terrible fate, to faithfully obey the orders to defend the country, and to not shrink back in the slightest. In this struggle, those who fight gloriously will be guaranteed their own lives and the lives of their loved ones, and those who conspire against the country will die in shame. Therefore, in the twelfth week of our party's rule, we must strengthen our determination to fight under any circumstances until we achieve final victory.

### Japanese Forces on the Southern Section of the Guangdong-Hankou Railway Occupy Shaoguan and Chen County; Another Unit Occupies Suichuan Airport

Tokyo, January 31st, Central News Agency Telegram: The Japanese General Headquarters announced at 3:30 PM on January 31st: (1) Japanese forces in China, in order to open up the southern part of the Guangdong-Hankou Railway, launched an offensive operation in mid-January from the Central and Southern China areas. (2) On the 27th, the northern and southern armies completed contact in the middle of Lechang and Shaozhou. (3) Another powerful unit of the Japanese army, in response to the above operation, attacked several enemy airfields in the Suichuan and Ganzhou areas. The vanguard of the Japanese army broke into Suichuan Airport on the night of the 28th and occupied it.

South China Frontline, January 31st, Central News Agency Telegram: The Japanese forces on the right bank of the Beijiang River launched a fierce attack on Shaoguan City from the east, west, and south sides since the 24th, engaging in fierce street fighting with approximately 6,000 Chongqing troops. On the evening of the 26th, they cooperated with artillery units and launched another fierce attack on the Chongqing army's position, finally completely occupying Shaoguan that night. The Chongqing army retreated to the north, and the Japanese army is currently pursuing them.

Guangdong-Hankou Railway Completely Opened

Hengyang, Japanese Central News Agency Telegram: According to news from the Hunan front, the Japanese forces on the southern section of the Guangdong-Hankou Railway suddenly began operations in mid-January, attacking the Chongqing army in various places. One route of the Japanese army started advancing from Daoxian on January 19th and reached the Guangdong-Hankou Railway on the 24th. Its leading unit penetrated deep into Guangdong Province and captured Lechang, a key point 60 kilometers from Shaoguan, and pursued the defeated Chongqing army, attacking Shaoguan, where the headquarters of the 7th War Area of the Chongqing army was located, and occupying it at 00:47 PM on the 24th. Another route of the Japanese army, advancing from near Leiyang, went south along the Guangdong-Hankou Railway on January 19th and attacked the outskirts of Chen County, where the headquarters of the 9th War Area of the Chongqing army was located, on the 24th, and occupied it at 2:50 PM on the 25th, causing the main force of the Chongqing army to flee to the eastern area of Guangdong-Hankou. By this point, the Guangdong-Hankou Railway had been completely opened. On the other hand, the Japanese air force also dispatched planes daily, braving the severe weather to cooperate with the ground forces, reaping great results. Before the start of this operation, Chongqing Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek had strictly ordered Xue Yue, commander of the 9th War Area, and Yu Hanmou, commander of the 7th War Area, to defend the southern section of the Guangdong-Hankou Railway, deploying a force of four armies and one division, including the Provisional 3rd Army, the 99th Army, the 65th Army, and the 63rd Army, in the 330-kilometer area from south of Leiyang to Yuantan, 60 kilometers southwest of Yingde. In addition, the 26th Army, the 37th Army, and the 3rd Army, totaling three armies and five divisions, were deployed in the areas of Xintian, Guiyang, and Linwu to secure the 280-kilometer Guangdong-Hankou Road from Gaotingzi, north of Chen County, to Lechang. However, due to the skillful operations of the Japanese army, all the armies of the Chongqing side were defeated by the Japanese army, and within only five days of the start of the operation, the Japanese army had taken control of all the key points in the southern section of the Guangdong-Hankou Railway. After the fall of Chen County, the base of the 7th and 9th War Areas of the Chongqing side, the troops of Xue Yue and Yu Hanmou fell into great chaos. Tracing back to last spring when the Japanese army launched an offensive operation against the Chongqing side's interior, the Chongqing army, in order to reverse the decline and allow the forces of the 1st and 8th War Areas to move south, prepared a counter-offensive centered on Guiyang, in an attempt to eliminate the threat to southwestern China, and at the same time, it attempted to establish contact with the remaining 3rd, 7th, and 9th War Areas in the south, but it ultimately became a bubble due to the capture of Shaoguan and Chen County by the Japanese army. At the same time, the troops of the 9th War Area of Chongqing have also lost their will to fight, and the troops of Yu Hanmou of the 7th War Area are also in a state of isolation.

Japanese Commando Raid Achieves Success

Hengyang, January 21st, Central News Agency Telegram: According to news from the Hunan front: Since the Japanese South China Expeditionary Force launched its offensive, the goal of connecting the Guangdong-Hankou Railway across the mainland has finally been achieved. A certain staff officer of the Japanese army inspected the Chongqing army's positions along the railway line by plane on the 19th, confirmed that the Japanese army's commando raid had been successful, and made the following remarks:

The success of this operation depends entirely on whether the commando raid can succeed. Therefore, all units collect reference materials for the commando's actions to discuss the implementation of special education for the commando raid. The commanders of each unit also study the detailed actions with maps, and make thorough preparations for the soldiers of the Chongqing army and the Confucian-dressed refugees. In particular, this commando action is an unprecedented example in the history of warfare. Over a long period of time, a powerful unit broke through the enemy's position, and the route was a rugged mountain road, lying in ambush and traveling at night. The maps they carried were obtained from the enemy, so they were extremely inaccurate. At times, the actual distance traveled was twice the distance on the map. The suffering of walking in the dark by compass is beyond description. When I was observing from the air, I found about ten Japanese soldiers advancing in Chinese clothing. After discovering a friendly aircraft, they immediately waved to welcome it. From this, it can be seen that their surprise attack had been successful, and the nearby farmers were unaware. Small groups of farmers were still walking on the road, with no atmosphere of battle. At that time, the Japanese commando team had already occupied the train station near the railway bridge. There were still trains full of goods waiting to depart, and Japanese flags were flying on the key points along the railway line, which proves that the Japanese commando team had overcome all adverse conditions and completed a long-distance commando action.

### Military Commission Sends Personnel to Inspect Troops in Various Places

Nanjing, January 31st, Central News Agency Telegram: The inspection envoys dispatched by the Military Commission to inspect the National Army in various regions, Zhe Shu-huang and Zheng Da-zhang, are scheduled to depart for various regions on the 1st to begin the inspection.

### The Eastern Front West of Poznan Is Expanding; Soviet Forces Reach the Banks of the Obra River

Lisbon, January 31st, Central News Agency Telegram: According to German frontline news: The Soviet tank units and mechanized infantry units that broke through Trzciel and advanced approximately 60 kilometers into German territory finally reached the banks of the Obra River on the 30th, only 136 to 140 kilometers from Berlin. Berlin intelligence has confirmed the above facts. Another Soviet unit that advanced along the Poznan-Chojnice railway towards Pomerania has reached the north bank of the Notec River and is approaching Landsberg from Krzyż. The Soviet forces in East Prussia are moving towards the west and southwest of Königsberg, and Königsberg is now surrounded.

Berlin, January 31st, Central News Agency Telegram: Havas News Agency: The two objectives of the Soviet tank vanguard in the Poznan area are that the vanguard between Driesen and Krzyż has Stargard and Stettin as its targets. The vanguard that has crossed the line of Meseritz, Swiebodzin, and Züllichau is advancing towards the lower reaches of the Warta River and south of Frankfurt. There are German forces operating behind this vanguard, and there is a constant risk of it being cut off. Furthermore, the battle for Poznan is still very fierce, and the Soviet forces are also being greatly restrained. In the past 24 hours, the defenders of Bromberg have also prevented the enemy from breaking through.

Soviet Offensive in the Southern Sector Thwarted

Berlin, January 31st, Central News Agency Telegram: Havas News Agency: The German resistance on the Eastern Front is showing obvious signs of strengthening. In the Beskids and Upper Silesian coal mining area in the southern sector, the Soviet offensive aimed to break into the Pszczyna protected area, but due to the strong resistance of the German forces, the Soviet ambition has been thwarted. Street fighting continues in the Upper Silesian industrial area. The elite Soviet forces are still being tied down, and the pressure along the Warta River front has slowed down.

### Super Offensive by Soviet Forces: Troop Deployment

Tokyo, January 31st, Central News Agency Telegram: According to a Berlin dispatch, the German authorities have stated that the current Soviet offensive is a super offensive, and from the perspective of large-scale form, it is actually a decisive battle between Germany and the Soviet Union. If we look at the Western Front, the anti-Axis forces have only 80 divisions, and due to centuries of national resistance and natural obstacles, such as the Maginot Line and other artificial obstacles in the western fortress line, it is not easy to break into the heart of Germany. On the other hand, the total strength of the Soviet forces on the Eastern Front is 350 divisions, with approximately 7,000 tanks. The terrain is flat, and the only defensive lines of rivers and lakes are completely frozen, so tanks can pass freely, making it not easy to stop the Soviet offensive. In addition to the 55 divisions in Courland, the 50 divisions in Hungary, and the follow-up troops, there are approximately 320 divisions advancing towards mainland Germany from East Prussia to Slovakia. One division has approximately 10,000 troops, plus 35 tank regiments. In addition, there are more than ten small tank units attached to infantry divisions. A tank regiment is composed of a tank brigade and a mechanized infantry brigade, with approximately 150 tanks. Therefore, the total number of Soviet tanks is approximately 7,000.

Offensive Focus

Initially, East Prussia, south to Silesia. According to an unofficial announcement by the German authorities, the Soviet sniper troops in eastern East Prussia have 41 divisions and 2 tank divisions. Approximately 58 divisions and 8 tank regiments are advancing towards Danzig, with half of the total force advancing in that direction. The second focus is the area from Silesia to Breslau, with approximately 70 divisions of sniper troops and powerful tank units. In the central front advancing towards Berlin from the Poznan area, the Soviet forces have approached a point 158 miles east of Berlin. The protruding forces on this front have relatively few troops, and it seems that they are mainly composed of tank units, carrying out a breakthrough operation. From the above deployment of Soviet forces, it can be seen that they will first launch a major attack from the north and south wings, dispersing the German reserves on both ends. After determining their combat power, they will attack the weak points of the German army. After the front line collapses, they will launch a frontal attack on Berlin.

Imitating German Strategy

Based on the current assessment of the Soviet offensive, it seems to be imitating the German strategy against France in the early stages of the war, with tank units followed by supply trucks and mechanized infantry, so they can continue to advance rapidly for 20 to 30 kilometers a day. The German government also recognizes the seriousness of the situation and warns the people to take countermeasures, but so far it cannot be said that all of its countermeasures have been launched. The Soviet offensive is only being supported by local troops and people's assault teams of nearby residents. It is not surprising that the Soviet advance has not been stopped because the full-scale countermeasures have not yet been launched. The German army still has newly formed elite troops and a large number of reserves. Whether it will mobilize them for a large-scale counter-offensive like the one on the Western Front, or distribute them on the front lines to stop the Soviet advance, or concentrate its forces in one or two places for a major counterattack, is still undecided, but it will definitely not go beyond this range. If it chooses the latter, Berlin may be temporarily sacrificed, resulting in street fighting. At the same time, the anti-Axis forces on the Western Front will definitely not give up the opportunity and are likely to launch an offensive with their current forces in the near future. The situation in these two weeks is extremely critical. German soldiers and civilians trust the Supreme Command and perform their duties with surprising calmness. The National Socialist Party is also guiding the people with vigorous energy.

### Guatemala in South America Severs Relations with Spain

Lisbon, January 31st, Central News Agency Telegram: German News Agency, Washington: US Congressman Coffer of the Democratic Party expressed satisfaction with Guatemala's announcement of the severance of relations with Spain. He told a Reuters reporter that the South American countries will soon take the same steps as Guatemala.

### An Overview of Zhoupu (Part 1)

— Yifei

Amidst the rising tide of voices calling for Shanghai's municipal revitalization and population dispersion, the seven counties under the jurisdiction of the Shanghai Municipality are becoming increasingly important. This reporter was dispatched to revisit the Nanhui area for investigation, hoping to gain insights and provide references for the authorities and concerned individuals.

There's a common saying, "Golden Nanhui, Silver Shanghai," and the essence of Nanhui is mostly concentrated in Zhoupu. Zhoupu is the fifth administrative district of Nanhui County and its largest town.

Trade

Zhoupu's transportation is highly developed. Its trade network not only controls the entire Nanhui County but also extends eastward through Chuansha, out of Bailonggang, for sales to Hebei, Tianjin, and other places. Southward, it follows the inland rivers to Fengxian, Jinshan, and Songjiang counties, and even reaches the east of Zhejiang via Jinshanwei. Its major exports to Shanghai are cotton, wheat, and rice, while to the interior, they are daily necessities. Imports mainly consist of cotton and wheat produced locally, rice from Songjiang and Jinshan, and oil and sesame from eastern Zhejiang.

The entire district is divided into eighteen townships. The total population is 816,511, with the highest density in Zhoupu Town, numbering 132,611. Farmers make up the largest occupation, followed by merchants. According to the latest statistics, the total farmland in the district is 149,354 mu.

Livelihood

Currently, the most pressing hardship is the inability to ensure security in the four rural areas. Although Liang Zhushi, the captain of the third squadron of the local security team, has been making every effort to maintain order, with the assistance of friendly forces, stability has significantly improved compared to before. However, due to the vast area, there is a feeling of being unable to attend to everything. This has led to small groups of roaming bandits operating in the border areas, and unfortunately, farmers are also the target of heavy taxes. Moreover, the farmers in this area are predominantly semi-tenant farmers. Landlords, due to the high cost of living in recent years, are reviving old practices. They collect rent in kind, effectively receiving 4.4 dou of white rice per mu. Based on current rice prices, this has increased to 17,000 to 18,000 yuan, several times more than before. Furthermore, last year, the region was hit by a hurricane for five days in June, severely impacting the rice and cotton crops, leading to widespread poor harvests. Coupled with the fact that the land in this area is originally classified as "inferior," the best harvest yields only 100 jin of grain in rice terms, while the next best yields only a few dozen jin. Therefore, farmers work hard throughout the year, but their income is minimal. This phenomenon is most pronounced in the eastern townships of Leshan, Yanchuan, Xiukang, and Baiqu.

As for merchants, although current prices are rising daily, seemingly bringing profit, it is difficult to replenish goods once sold, leading to a shortage of stock for most businesses. When transporting goods into the area, numerous checkpoints along the way increase costs, and sometimes goods are detained, resulting in significant losses. On the route to Shanghai, rice vendors are seen in large numbers, presenting a remarkable sight. In addition to local residents, there are also police officers and postal workers among them. It is said that transporting five dou of rice from Zhoupu to Shanghai can still yield a profit (over 2,000 yuan per five dou) despite "expenses" along the way. If checkpoints could be eliminated and free transportation allowed, the cost for rice vendors would be reduced, and the price of rice in Shanghai would likely drop significantly.

Finance

The prosperity of Shanghai's Nanshi district was almost completely destroyed after the incident, but unexpectedly, it is now reappearing in Zhoupu, separated by a river. Currently, Zhoupu is the only outlet for Pudong. Driven by environmental needs, the financial industry is also experiencing an abnormal boom, a phenomenon that is not accidental.

As of recently, there are a total of ten banks, money shops, and trust companies in Zhoupu. There are also five or six quasi-money shops (businesses that, after registration with the county government, are allowed to issue notes with the same effect as checks) and those about to open. This is an unprecedented boom, incomparable to the pre-war situation when there were only the Pudong and Jiangsu Farmers' banks. Listed in the order of their establishment, the names are as follows: (1) Huichang Bank (2) Fuxing Bank (3) Hexin Trust Company (4) Nongxing Bank (5) Tianhe Money Shop (6) Huada Money Shop (7) Yongchang Money Shop (8) Tobacco Industry Bank (9) Wanli Bank (10) Xinkang Money Shop. The first five have branches in Shanghai, with capital generally ranging from five million to ten million yuan. Huichang was established by Shen Laiyi, a local gentry, with a capital of 400,000 yuan. It opened on August 5, 1942. The current deposits of the bank have reached over ten million yuan. It also has branches in Nanhui Chengxiang Town, Xinchang Town, and Zhuqiao Town, as well as an office in Shanghai. The Fuxing Bank is municipal and specializes in collecting land taxes during the Qingxiang period, and also acts as the city treasury, making it a leader in the industry.

The main business of these banks and money shops is lending, with interest rates almost double those of Shanghai banks due to the lack of a reserve system and the difficulty of transporting cash. Agricultural loans, however, usually start at the beginning of spring plowing and end at the end of the autumn harvest, with interest rates about half that of commercial loans. This is the greatest contribution of the banking industry to the local area.

Zhoupu is located in the midst of agricultural areas. When agricultural products are brought to market, merchants with funds come to the town to buy them and then export them, creating a temporary influx of capital. However, at the end of the lunar year, farmers withdraw their funds to buy miscellaneous goods in Shanghai and to pay taxes, causing local credit to become extremely tight again. In the current situation in Zhoupu, the development of the banking industry has exceeded actual needs. Furthermore, as the Financial Inspection Office of the Central Reserve Bank has not yet focused on this area, some institutions inevitably have insufficient capital and are simply filling the numbers. According to insiders, if strict inspections are implemented in the future, and 30% of the total floating deposits of each bank and money shop is required as reserve funds, those with weak capital will suffer a fatal blow and be eliminated. Based on the current situation, this would likely be more than half. This shows that its organization is not entirely sound and that capital is insufficient.

### Police Bureau to Formally Adjust Organization Today: Streamlining and Increasing Work Efficiency

Since Commissioner Zhou also became the head of the Police Bureau, major reforms have been implemented in police administration, and the organization has been adjusted to simplify it and increase work efficiency. The reorganization will officially take effect today:

Original Nine Divisions Reduced to Seven

The original Personnel Committee has been abolished, and the original names of the Secretariat, General Affairs Division, Administrative Division, Judicial Division, Defense Division, Special High Division, and Economic Security Division have been abolished. They have been replaced by the First, Second, Third, and Fourth Divisions. The First Division handles all comprehensive affairs such as general affairs, documents, accounting, general services, and personnel. The Second Division handles administrative and defense affairs. The Third Division handles judicial affairs. The Fourth Division handles special high, economic security, and Baojia affairs. However, the Inspection Division, Security Division, and Firefighting Division will continue to exist under their original names.

Each Branch Bureau to be Restructured into a Four-Section System

At the same time, the organization of each branch bureau will also be adjusted. The original six sections – General Affairs Section, Administrative Section, Judicial Section, Police Defense Section, Special High Section, and Baojia Section – will be abolished. They will be replaced by the First, Second, Third, and Fourth Sections. The First Section handles documents, accounting, general services, and personnel matters. The Second Section handles police defense and administrative matters. The Third Section handles judicial internal and external affairs. The Fourth Section handles special matters related to the Baojia household registration system. All staff members of each branch bureau, except for the branch chief and deputy branch chief, will be assigned to the newly formed four sections. The staff and clerks of the original General Affairs Section, as well as the clerks in the chief's office, will be assigned to the First Section. The staff of the Administrative and Police Defense Sections will be merged into the Second Section. Except for the clerks, all will be required to wear uniforms and perform duties. The Judicial Section will be assigned to the Third Section. The staff of the Special High and Baojia Sections will be assigned to the Fourth Section. Uniformed police officers and clerks will be assigned to the household registration group, while plainclothes police officers will be assigned to the investigation group. As for the selection of division chiefs and section chiefs of each branch bureau, the bureau is carefully considering and appointing them, and the official announcement will be made within days.

### Retail Special Consumption Tax on Goods: Tax Rate Increased Today, Changed to 5% Ad Valorem

Since Mayor Zhou took office, he has been determined to implement reforms in all aspects of municipal administration. Taking finance as an example, on the one hand, he is striving to eliminate corruption and embezzlement, and on the other hand, he is trying to improve the salaries of public officials. This necessitates slightly expanding sources of tax revenue. After careful consideration, it was decided to increase the consumption special tax by 1%, effective from February 1st. The notice from the municipal government is recorded below: "Upon investigation, the tax rate for the special consumption tax on retail goods in this city, which is generally 4% ad valorem, will be changed to 5% ad valorem from February 1st. All tax revenue from this 1% increase will be allocated to the municipal treasury. This has been approved by the Central Government on record."

### Su Takes Over as Director of the Qingxiang Affairs Bureau

Su Chengde, the director of the Shanghai Qingxiang Affairs Bureau, is scheduled to go to Fahua at 9:00 AM on February 1st to take charge of the Qingxiang Affairs Bureau.

### Special Tax on Pigs: Adjusted Valuation

The Shanghai Municipal Finance Bureau determined that the special business tax on pigs in the city was previously assessed at 4,000 yuan per head. As the market price of pigs has recently soared, the original valuation is no longer applicable. Therefore, the minimum valuation for each pig has been set at 8,000 yuan per head, and the tax will be levied at 5% ad valorem, calculated as 400 yuan per head. This has been approved by the municipal government and will be implemented from February of this year according to the new valuation. The valuation of other taxes is also being adjusted and will be announced successively. The bureau is still studying and planning the issue of business tax in the first and eighth districts and it is anticipated that the business tax for the spring of this year will be collected from March.

### Dismissal of Employees at the End of the Lunar Year Not Allowed Without Just Cause

The end of the lunar year is approaching. The Municipal Social Welfare Bureau believes that the practice of dismissing employees by businesses at the end of the year is unreasonable and should be abolished. Especially in this extraordinary period, labor and management should cooperate with each other to stabilize society. Employers should not use the customary practice of dismissing employees at the end of the year as an excuse to dismiss employees at will. Strict sanctions will be imposed. Even if it is absolutely necessary, the livelihood of the other party should be considered, and dismissals should only be carried out according to legal procedures. It is hoped that all Ronghang businesses in the city will understand this.

### Roads in Disrepair to be Repaired

The Municipal Public Works Bureau believes that some major roads in the city have been in disrepair for many years, hindering transportation. Therefore, it plans to thoroughly repair them. It is understood that the authorities are actively planning to implement this work, and it is said that a meeting will be held with relevant parties in the coming days to discuss the promotion plan.

### Citizen Police Assist in Arresting Thieves: Crime Prevention Bonus Awarded, Award Ceremony Held Yesterday

The Huangpu Police Branch of this city held an award ceremony for citizen police officers who assisted in arresting thieves at the branch square at 3:00 PM yesterday (the 31st). Present were Li Shiyu, director of the Judicial Division of the Municipal Police Bureau, Deputy Director Xian Erlang, Huangpu Branch Chief Kobayashi Minesaburo, Deputy Branch Chief Liu Yaying, and many district general Lianbao chiefs, as well as more than 600 air defense team members from various districts. The ceremony was held on time. First, Branch Chief Kobayashi reported on the assistance in the arrest, stating that on the morning of the 19th of this month, at 11:30 AM, Lu Zhongqi (14 years old), an apprentice at the Lishen Securities Company on Dianchi Road, was carrying a gold bar worth nearly one million yuan, intending to take it to the Tongji Bank on Henan Road. On the way, he was lured into an alley by a robber named Zhang Peizhen, who attempted to steal the gold bar. Lu shouted loudly, and Zhang took out an iron weapon, injuring his head and hands. Li Xianggen, Yao Wenfu, Yang Genquan, and others, who were returning from air defense training, bravely pursued and captured the robber, turning him over to the police station. They also provided first aid to the injured person and sent him to the hospital. This courageous spirit is commendable. Subsequently, Judicial Director Li delivered a speech, explaining in detail the relationship between citizen police and crime prevention, stating that the relationship between citizen police and crime prevention is very close and can be divided into two points: social solidarity, that is, joint prevention in advance, and the effect of punishment, that is, punishing criminals afterward. Given that citizen police officers voluntarily assisted in arresting the thief, which has a very significant impact on the contribution to overall social security and crime prevention, I have allocated a portion of the crime prevention fund to be used as a reward, and I hope that people in society will jointly assist in arresting criminals in the future. Then the award ceremony was held, with Li Xianggen (26 years old) receiving 30,000 yuan, and Yao Wenfu (25 years old) and Yang Genquan (23 years old) each receiving 20,000 yuan. Subsequently, General Lianbao Chief Ge Weian expressed his gratitude, and the Lianbao chief representative gave a thank-you speech. Finally, a parade was held, with each team member showing great spirit. Director Li expressed his appreciation.

Since Mayor Zhou and Secretary-General Luo took office, the municipal administration of this city has shown a new look. The city's residents have a unified expectation for the new municipal administration, and the authorities have also declared their determination. The goals of officials and the people are completely the same. However, how can officials and the people further cooperate to achieve the goal as soon as possible? This is the most important issue. This newspaper is willing to do its best in this regard. It will launch a "Shanghai Municipal Administration" column to publish the authorities' intentions for municipal measures, the demands of the citizens, the citizens' suggestions for municipal measures, and the demands of the authorities, in order to communicate opinions, understand each other, and then cooperate together. It will be published once a week, and we sincerely hope that municipal authorities and citizens will contribute articles on what they have heard, seen, and want to say. Once published, we will send a small reward.

### Huazhong Water and Electricity Company to Shorten Power Supply Time Starting Yesterday: Power Supply Suspended for Ordinary Users from 10:00 PM Every Night

According to the Huazhong Water and Electricity Company, in order to save fuel, starting yesterday, the power supply to all ordinary users will be suspended from 10:00 PM every night. Street lights and public institutions will continue to be supplied as usual. It is also understood that the implementation of shortening the power supply time contains a trial nature, so it is a temporary phenomenon. The original state will be restored after 10 o'clock at the time.

### "Narcissus" Charity Performance to Raise Funds for the Nursing Home Starts Today

It is reported that Lan Ting, Li Sihao, Lin Kanghou, Yuan Ludeng, and others are raising funds for the Shanghai Nursing Home and have launched a drama, a charity performance of "Narcissus", and invited Tang Ruoqing, Shi Hui, Yuan Shaolan, Du Ping and other artists to cooperate. From tonight to the 10th, it will be performed at the Carlton Theater for eleven days, with performances every day and night (the day performance starts at 2:30 PM, and the night performance starts at 7:30 PM). The ticket prices are divided into three types: honorary tickets for 5,000 yuan, 3,000 yuan, and 2,000 yuan, and two types of ordinary tickets for 1,000 yuan and 400 yuan. In addition to honorary tickets, the social service of this newspaper also sells them on consignment. The rest can be ordered from the Carlton.

"Narcissus" was written by Gu Zhongyi, depicting a pure and innocent woman – Ouyang Xian – who is not swayed by interests and desires, and not assimilated by the murky current. She and Tao Xiannan are deeply in love with each other. Even when Xiannan is blind, she never changes her original intention. Although good things are often difficult to achieve, and Xiannan is poor and frustrated, she does not regret her initial intention. At the time of her illness, she gave us a noble revelation, which is moving and lingers in our minds. It is hoped that people from all walks of life will bravely do what is right and enthusiastically purchase tickets. It is both watching a famous drama and helping a good cause. Why not do it?

### Citywide Street Trees and Small Branches: Order to Stop Trimming

The branches of the trees along the streets in this city are sprouting small branches every winter. Because this obstructs traffic, the Public Works Bureau has traditionally dispatched workers to trim them. However, since the road section of the bureau had staff members who were found to be cutting down trees and selling them off, the work of trimming tree branches in the suburbs was immediately ordered to be suspended. This year, the small branches of roadside trees in all districts of the city will be stopped entirely. After the bureau received the order, it immediately instructed the responsible sections to forward it to be followed.

### Bank Clearing House to Cancel Next-Day Return of Checks

The Bank Clearing House has decided to cancel the practice of returning checks the next day and stipulates: (1) The return of checks between clearing banks, except for those presented by the Clearing House, should be returned to the original presenting bank on the same day in principle. Those that cannot be returned on the same day should be sent no later than 10:15 AM the next morning. (2) The return of checks after clearing by the Clearing House on behalf of the exchange banks, as well as the return of checks in the bills collected or presented for exchange by the Clearing House, must be completed by 7:00 PM on the same day. The Clearing House will not accept those that are delivered late and will be returned directly to the original presenting bank by the returning bank. However, the delivery time should still not exceed 10:15 AM the next morning.

### Fundraising for the Contagious Disease Hospital: Urgent Hope for Donations from All Circles

The Shanghai Contagious Disease Hospital is in a state of paralysis because the funds have dried up for the 72 free beds and the giving of medicine to the poor and the sick year round, it cannot continue operating without intervention. It has launched a fundraising campaign, asking for support from all sectors towards a goal of 20 million yuan, divided into 2,000 teams of 10,000 yuan each. Fundraising has been going on for half a month, but the effect has been minimal. There is no shortage of philanthropic people in this city, such as those who can recognize the team, or collect relatives and friends to form a team, or solicit for a team. This 20 million yuan can be obtained immediately, and that with the the hardship of life, has reached the extreme, and poverty is increasing day by day. This active medical relief is not inferior to other charitable work. It is hoped that people with wealth will respond and, at this end of the lunar year, will economize on wasteful spending, relieve poverty and illness, and benefit society.

### HSBC Bank Handles Remittances to Yuyao

In order to assist the Yuyao compatriots, the bank will waive the remittance fee for remittances below 5,000 yuan from today.

### "Special Fundraising" for Student Aid Decided to Continue; Goal Not Yet Reached, Hoping for Final Efforts

The "Special Fundraising" organized by this newspaper for the purpose of raising the eighth student aid fund has now been going on for two months, and it should have been stopped and brought to an end. However, upon investigation, the amount raised is still three million yuan short of the original target of twenty million yuan. Moreover, there is a significant disparity between the amount required for student aid and the budgeted amount. We have been compelled to decide to continue the fundraising efforts. We cannot yet determine the official closing date, and we ask for responses from all sectors of society. From today, schools will be starting one after another. This newspaper has largely completed the review procedures for student aid applicants at all levels, from elementary school to university. The disbursement of student aid will also begin today, with elementary schools first, followed by junior high, senior high, and then vocational schools and universities. The list of elementary school recipients was published yesterday. The approved list for junior high school and above will be published successively. It is expected that all disbursements can be completed within ten days. As for the amount of student aid stipulated and the amount to be paid by the schools, there are still many discrepancies. Due to the shortage of funds, this newspaper is making comprehensive plans and regretting that we cannot increase the amount further. We have now made a final decision to slightly increase the aid for all levels except for the elementary school group, which has already been distributed, in order to alleviate the burden on the parents of the aided students. Specifically, junior high school students will receive an additional 1,000 yuan, increasing the amount to 8,500 yuan per person; senior high school and vocational school students will receive an additional 2,000 yuan, increasing the amount to 12,000 yuan per person; and university students will receive an additional 5,000 yuan, increasing the amount to 20,000 yuan per person. According to this budget, the total amount required will be more than 3.6 million yuan, which is still 10 million yuan short of the current total. Therefore, continuing the fundraising is imperative. Regarding new applications, the staff of this newspaper, in view of the current tense situation and the economic depression, which have affected the progress of fundraising, feel exhausted and deeply regretful!

Adhering to the Last Wishes, Saving on Student Aid

A letter from the funeral arrangement office of He Yu-kun Tang states: "Respected Editor, the esteemed mother of He Ti-jun, Ruo-min, and Sheng-xian, Madam Huang, passed away in Shanghai. On her deathbed, she said that in these extraordinary times, the country is full of devastation. She earnestly requested that the funeral be kept simple. Her filial sons, adhering to Madam Huang's last wishes, will donate the saved funds and generous gifts from relatives and friends to various charitable organizations, as a small token of Madam's legacy. They also want to create blessings for relatives and friends and benefit the community. Herewith is a check for 100,000 yuan in savings certificates, presented to your newspaper to be used as student aid funds. Please issue a receipt for our records."

The Significance of Student Aid is Beyond Words

A letter from Yi Wo Zhai Fu states: "Respected Editor, the matter is urgent, time is fleeting! It will not return! Whether the ten thousand-plus student aid recipients of the Shen Bao and Xin Bao newspapers can completely continue their studies depends entirely on how all sectors of society can assist. I, with my remaining strength after enduring hardship, in addition to actively mobilizing support from all sides, will do my best to donate another 100,000 yuan in national currency, distributing 50,000 yuan each to your newspaper and the Xin Wen Bao, under the name of the "Shanghai People's Honor Team". I further implore major companies, factories, wealthy gentlemen, and businesses to take the lead and willingly contribute. With united will, the more than ten thousand poor and needy brothers and sisters will be spared the pain of dropping out of school, which is like losing one's sight."
