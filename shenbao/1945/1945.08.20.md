### Jiang Bocheng Appointed as Chairman Chiang's Representative in Shanghai; Huang Boqiao Appointed Secretary-General of Established Office

Chongqing – Chairman Chiang Kai-shek appointed Jiang Bocheng on the 18th as the Military Affairs Commission Chairman’s representative in Shanghai, and He Qigongru as the representative in Beiping.

Special Report – Following Jiang Bocheng’s appointment as Chairman Chiang’s representative in Shanghai, he immediately began organizing the Military Affairs Commission Chairman’s representative office in Shanghai, which has been established and commenced operations. Huang Boqiao has been appointed as the office's Secretary-General.

Brief Biography of Jiang Bocheng – Jiang Bocheng, a native of Zhejiang, served as Chief of Staff of the Eastern Route Headquarters of the National Revolutionary Army in 1927. He and the Commander-in-Chief He Yingqin entered Zhejiang from Fujian and later participated in the capture of Jiangsu. In the same year, he served as a member of the Zhejiang Provincial Government Committee and Commander of the Provincial Defense Army. After the Ning-Han merger, he served as a member of the Zhejiang Provincial Government and Director of the Military Affairs Department, also acting as Chairman. After the completion of the Northern Expedition in 1928, he served as a senior advisor to the Commander-in-Chief of the Army, Navy, and Air Force, and as a member of the Zhejiang Provincial Government. In 1930, after Han Fuqu was appointed Chairman of the Shandong Provincial Government, the central government sent Jiang to Jinan to guide and liaise, also serving as Chairman Chiang's representative in North China. After the incident occurred and Shanghai fell, he was ordered to come to Shanghai to work, enduring hardship for several years.

Brief Biography of Huang Boqiao – Huang Boqiao, from Taicang, Jiangsu, graduated from the first class of the Mechanical Engineering Department of Tongji University. In 1920, he went to Europe to inspect municipal administration and studied at the Berlin Institute of Technology in Germany. Upon returning to China in 1922, he served as the Director of the Shanghai Shi Hua Iron Works and Principal of the Shi Hua Vocational School, Director of the Hankou and Hangzhou Public Works Bureaus, Director of the Shanghai Special Municipality Public Utilities Bureau and Acting Secretary-General of the Municipal Government, and Director of the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Administration, where he was known for rectifying railway administration.

### New Zealand to Send Warship into Japanese Territorial Waters

### Development of Sino-US Trade Still Requires Considerable Time

New York, 17th – Due to the sudden surrender of Japan, the United States was largely unprepared for the industrial and manpower recovery that must be implemented. This is because the US government and industrial experts believed that the war with Japan would not end until the end of 1945 or the beginning of the following year. Therefore, all plans for the transition from war to peacetime were based on this assumption. As a result, the rapid end of the war has temporarily caused serious economic chaos. According to a survey conducted by reporters among groups related to trade with China, such as the American Foreign Trade Association and the Sino-American Industrial and Commercial Advancement Association, it is generally believed that the collapse of Japan will naturally help the development of Sino-US trade relations. However, until the recovery of American industry is in sight, industrial production cannot meet the needs of American consumers for at least a month, and only after domestic needs are met can foreign trade be developed. As far as trade between China and the United States is concerned, although American industrialists and businessmen are eager to restore peacetime trade with China, they are also deeply aware of many difficulties, such as: American ships are used for occupation forces and foreign relief, so there is a great lack of shipping for private commercial use; China lacks adequate high-quality products to exchange for American goods; China has no clear regulations for the management of foreign businesses.

### Committee Member He Announces Letter to Youth Comrades in Three Provinces

He Minhun, Committee Member of the Propaganda Committee of the Military Affairs Commission of the National Government for Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui, recently published a letter to youth compatriots and Kuomintang comrades in the occupied areas of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui. The original text is recorded as follows:

Letter to Youth Compatriots:

Youth Compatriots,

After eight years of united hard work by the military and civilians across the country, the great victory of the sacred War of Resistance has been achieved, and the Japanese government has already surrendered.

Youth are the treasure of the nation and the backbone of the country. Chinese youth especially retain a glorious revolutionary tradition and revolutionary spirit. Over the past few years, the physical and mental destruction and the deep suffering you have suffered in the occupied areas have been unavoidable. Our central government is constantly concerned about this. At this very moment when light arrives and darkness is eliminated, we solemnly agree with the young students on the following matters:

On this day of victory and peace, in addition to rejoicing and dancing, we must maintain the demeanor of cultured youth of a great country. All words and deeds must be calm and composed, and avoid any emotional and rash actions.

A small number of young compatriots in various places, who in the past lived a corrupt life of extravagance and lingering in singing halls and dance halls, should immediately and thoroughly reform and take hard work, simplicity, and plainness as the criteria for a new life, and cheer up.

Young students in various places should continue to attend classes, maintain school order, and accelerate the absorption of scientific knowledge and learn scientific and technological skills, so as to contribute to the great cause of building a new China.

Strengthen the sense of responsibility and obligation of young people to the country and the nation, promote the glorious revolutionary tradition of the young, unite and be down-to-earth, and prepare for usefulness.

Young people in various places should stand in front of the general public, support the central government, trust the central government, and assist the central government in promoting all reconstruction work. Comrades:

Our Chinese Kuomintang leads the military and civilians of the whole country and adheres to the Three People's Principles. Overcoming all difficulties, after more than eight years of hard struggle, the great victory of the sacred War of Resistance has finally been achieved. The Japanese government has unconditionally surrendered, and world peace has finally been realized. This is the glory of the Republic of China, and it is also the glory of the Chinese Kuomintang, which created the Republic of China and led the War of Resistance.

Now that peace has been realized, our party's mission has not been fully completed, and the great cause of nation-building must be actively promoted. From today onwards, our party comrades must lead the people to establish a solid foundation for national unity in politics, fully develop reconstruction in the economy, popularize education among the people in culture, and contribute to world civilization. In this extraordinary period of Chinese history, it is also a period of severe trials for our party. With a solemn and sincere attitude, I agree with the comrades of our party in the occupied areas of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui on the following matters:

Restore and establish local party organizations, fully carry out publicity and training activities for the people. Investigate and register all traitors and all accomplices in various places, and await instructions from the central government.

Lead the people, set an example, and in addition to rejoicing in battle, do not forget to maintain the demeanor of a great nation. Do not be emotionally excited or rash when dealing with kind and peaceful Japanese women and children, overseas Chinese, and Japanese soldiers who have already disarmed.

Lead the people, hoist the national flag, convene celebrations in various places, and carry out various celebration activities to welcome the central army to enter the occupied areas.

Lead the people from all walks of life in industry and commerce to settle down in their respective industries, do not panic, and maintain social order and supply the daily necessities of the people in the spirit of harmony and common wealth.

Lead the people to welcome the anti-Japanese patriots released from the enemy's military police forces or prisons, and the allied overseas Chinese released from various concentration camps, and do their best to provide them with various support.

Lead the people to welcome the compatriots who have returned from the mainland to the occupied areas of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui, and do their best to provide them with convenience in life and assistance in material terms.

Lead the people, support the central government, assist the central government, actively promote all reconstruction work, and continue to struggle to realize the Three People's Principles and complete the national revolution.

### An Eyewitness Account of Locust Eradication in Danyang

— Lan Huo

When the reporter arrived in Danyang, it was in the midst of a locust plague. The most severely affected areas were Lian Lake in the west gate and Guanyin Mountain in the north gate. In addition, the villages of Sancheng, Zhangxiang, Shuangdun, and Binhu were also impacted. It is said that the source of this locust infestation originated in Bagua Zhou in Nanjing. Due to the drought this year and the late arrival of the tides, the locust eggs that used to be under the reeds around the island thrived. Farmers were negligent, and soon the locusts spread to Yaohuamen, Zhenjiang, Xinfeng, Enji, and Danyang.

Locusts Passing Through Drop Eggs. Locusts were first discovered in Danyang in mid-July. At that time, locusts had passed through the area and laid eggs in the fields. After the discovery, the nearby farmers, regardless of gender or age, immediately mobilized to search for and dig up the egg nests. Ultimately, the locusts grew too quickly to be eliminated, and they became nymphs, spreading across the mountains and fields and becoming uncontrollable. The most intense day of locust eradication was August 5th. On that day, the urban area alone mobilized 23 bao (units of local administration), and including the rural areas, no less than ten thousand people participated. Fortunately, the locust nymphs in Danyang were mostly found in the hills and grasslands, so they rarely damaged crops and were easier to kill.

The method of eliminating locusts began with two inspectors searching for locust nymphs. Upon discovery, they would raise the flag they carried at the densely populated area and sound the gong to gather the crowd. The methods of killing locusts were generally divided into three types: encirclement and capture, petroleum asphyxiation, and burning. The encirclement method involved dozens to hundreds of people forming a circle. One half of the circle was enclosed by double-width white cloth, and the other half was formed by farmers tightly lined up in a semicircle, using rakes (farm tools for threshing wheat) or woven branches (called "tree brooms" locally). In a unified step, they vigorously advanced and drove the locusts, gradually shrinking the circle. Under the pressure of the rakes and woven branches, the locust nymphs either died or had to escape to the area of the cloth. When there was no escape, they jumped onto the cloth, and the farmers would gather up the white cloth, pour the nymphs into straw bags, and bury them underground. The petroleum asphyxiation method involved pouring kerosene into ditches and driving the nymphs into the ditches. The oil, being lighter, floated on the surface of the water, and the nymphs suffocated and died upon falling into the ditches. The burning method was similar to the previous two methods in driving the locusts, but dry grass was placed in the middle, and after driving the locusts onto the grass, it was set on fire.

Bao Chief Freely Talks About the Locust Eradication Process

In order to understand the actual situation of locust eradication, the reporter followed the villagers on the morning of August 7th, stepping through the dew, to observe the area around Guanyin Mountain in the west gate. While walking, the reporter chatted with the villagers. Among them, a Bao chief from Sangu Village, named Sun, enthusiastically told the reporter about the process since the beginning of the locust eradication. He said, "For the past two weeks, we have been getting up this early every day. On the one hand, the locust nymphs are sluggish in the dew and easier to drive. On the other hand, it is the busy farming season, and eliminating the locusts early can save some time to engage in field work." Indeed, they were very hardworking. In terms of locust eradication alone, they would get up at four o'clock every morning before dawn, busy preparing breakfast. By the time they finished eating, it was already five o'clock, and the sky was somewhat bright. Upon hearing the gong, they would gather at the designated place and eradicate locusts under the sun until two o'clock, before returning home with empty stomachs to eat.

Guanyin Mountain is about three li (approximately one mile) from the city and is an area of rolling hills. When the reporter arrived, the sky was just dawning. Since it was not yet time to gather, several villagers accompanied the reporter to observe the locust nymphs. The density of the locust nymphs was so high that it would make people tremble at the sight of them. They jumped between the grasses, making rustling sounds, forming piles like flies clinging to a felt. Their heads and backs were black, and their abdomens were straw-yellow. The smaller ones were like crickets, and the larger ones had already grown small wings, shaped like gold bells. Upon hearing human voices, they jumped up in competition. One villager told the reporter, "Locusts must molt five times, each time for seven days, from egg to worm in two stages, from worm to nymph in one stage, and from nymph to locust in two stages. Now they are in the third or fourth stage. If they are not reduced in seven or eight days, they will all grow wings and fly away." Immediately, he conveniently caught a locust nymph and showed it to the reporter, saying, "This kind of nymph is gradually turning yellow, and small wings have grown on its back. In another week, its head and back will be completely yellow, and its wings will be fully grown, which can be very harmful. But now there are already such large nymphs here, so now is also the most serious period."

Gongs Sound in Unison, Personnel Gather. While the reporter was talking with the farmers, the gongs sounded in unison. Before long, many farmers came with tools to gather, men, women, young, and old, about a thousand people. First, the instructors counted and organized them into several groups, each group with about a hundred people, led by investigators to the places where flags had been planted to eliminate the locusts. One place was a dry ditch with steep banks. The nymphs in the grass between the banks were like flax. Because there was no water, the encirclement method was used, with cloth on one side and driving on the other. The work was effective. The locusts were shaken into one place, poured into straw bags, and the openings were left on the side. After finishing one area, they were led to the place where the flag was planted and began the second job. Each time, about ten catties of locust nymphs could be obtained.

Locust Eradication Work is Extremely Enthusiastic. While watching the locust eradication, a village head chatted with the reporter for a long time. He said, "Since the discovery of the locust nymphs, in order to encourage farmers to participate actively, we once engaged in buying them. Egg masses were five hundred yuan per liang (unit of weight), and nymphs were three hundred yuan per catty (unit of weight). In total, we received about two hundred and thirty tan (unit of volume). Countless more were killed. Although buying has now been stopped, there are still rewards. Every day after work, each person is given a box of matches, and Ren Dan (a type of Chinese medicine) and other items are also provided. The villagers have suffered from exploitation for many years and have nothing to live on. If there is another locust disaster, they will be put to death. So everyone is extremely enthusiastic about the locust eradication work." He also said, "The ones that passed through before were summer locusts, and the ones here now are autumn locusts. If they are not completely eradicated and lay eggs, they will be even more harmful next spring. In fact, it is not a pity if our county is affected alone. The most important areas are Yixing, Wujin, Wuxi, and Dangtu, the Taihu area, because that is the rice-producing area. But the trend shows that it is likely to spread there. Therefore, our locust eradication work is even more important. But there is also something painful to say. A few days ago, seeing that the spread of the locust nymphs was too great, we asked the urban area for help, hoping to assist in the locust eradication. Who knew that several families actually said, 'We don't have farmland in the countryside. Fighting locusts is the business of the villagers. If we kill the locusts, we still have to pay to buy rice from the villagers.' — They sell the rice from the countryside and eat it. Where will they buy rice from? They don't even think about the ancient saying, 'One locust not eradicated, ten thousand families suffer.'"

Five Locust Plagues in Sixty Years. By half past eleven, the locust eradication was completed for the day, with more than ten areas cleared and more than ten bags of nymphs obtained. On the way back, we took a break at a teahouse in the suburbs. At that time, an old farmer was there drinking tea and discussing the locusts with several villagers. So the reporter joined in. The old farmer very amiably told the reporter one by one. According to him, "I am over sixty years old this year and have suffered five locust plagues, three times during the Guangxu reign (late Qing dynasty) and once in the eighteenth year of the Republic of China (1929). But there weren't this many. At that time, in addition to the petroleum asphyxiation method, the other methods of killing locusts were slightly different. In the Qing dynasty, the village bao (chief) and jia (head) designated one person from each family to go out early to fight locusts, twice for those who lived nearby. Group fighting was similar to today. Individuals prepared a woven branch, a dustpan, and a bag, driving the locusts, half-dead or alive, into the dustpan, then pouring them into the bag. Once a bag was full, it was weighed by the catty, worth nine small coins per catty. The collected locusts were put into a lime tank or buried in a pit. At that time, you could eat two catties, but locusts are poisonous, and eating too much is easy to cause illness, so many later were unwilling to adopt this method."

The Locust-Repelling God Originated Here. The old farmer also said, "The locust-repelling god that the countryside worships actually originated in Danyang. According to legend, during the Dan reign, there was a magistrate of Liu Meng County. He governed in Danyang for several years, and there was a great harvest one year. But coincidentally, there was a locust plague during the harvest. Liu Meng was at a loss. Then he ate all the locusts by himself, and not a single crop was harmed. The villagers revered Liu Meng as the Locust-Repelling General." Here, the old farmer superstitiously added, "The so-called 'locust' means that the locusts fly 'south.' Therefore, the temple of General Liu Meng is built facing north, with the intention of monitoring the locusts, expressing the intention of suppressing them."

When the reporter left Danyang, 80 to 90 percent of the local locusts had been eradicated. At this time of victory in the War of Resistance and the realization of peace, it is believed that the local locusts will be eliminated as soon as possible. The local villagers, under this dual celebration of the revival of the motherland and the hope for this year's autumn harvest, will certainly be more enthusiastic and joyful than in other places.

### Shanghai Action Headquarters Established, Commander Zhou Issues Statement

Zhou Fohai was appointed by Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek on the 11th of this month as the commander of the Shanghai Action Headquarters, responsible for maintaining security in Shanghai and the Shanghai-Hangzhou area. After receiving the order, Mr. Zhou organized and established the headquarters, located within the former security headquarters of the French Concession on Fahua Road. Important internal officials and commanders of various units were appointed and began their work immediately. Mr. Zhou arrived in Shanghai from Nanjing yesterday (19th) and issued the following statement:

Responsible for Maintaining Security in Shanghai and Hangzhou. "On the 12th, I received an order from Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek to be responsible for maintaining security in Shanghai and the Shanghai-Hangzhou area, and was appointed as the commander of the Shanghai Action Headquarters, commanding the former Tax Police Regiment, the Shanghai Security Force, and the police, as well as three divisions under the 12th Army and part of the Zhejiang Security Force. Upon receiving the order, I felt deeply apprehensive and immediately established the headquarters, appointing various important officials and commanders of various columns, which have been reported for record. At this joyous night of peace, the excitement of the people is understandable, but a little carelessness can harm security. I am ordered to maintain it, and I hope that the following points will receive attention from all parties:

No units within the area under the jurisdiction of this headquarters may be moved or reorganized without the approval of the Generalissimo.

No gatherings or other actions related to security may be held without the approval of this headquarters.

There must be no humiliation or harm to the surrendered Japanese military and Japanese nationals.

The people's tax payment duties must still be fulfilled and must not be refused with difficult excuses.

Factory equipment and all important public materials must not be damaged, bought, or given away.

Friendly forces and units dispatched by the central government are requested to contact this headquarters.

During this transitional period, this commander will always supervise the troops under his command and do his best to maintain security. I hope that the people of the territory will be able to live and work in peace, abiding by their duties, assisting the local military and police, consolidating security, and maintaining the region, to await the arrival of the regular National Army. It must be known that during this transitional period, a little carelessness in action can easily cause turmoil, and security will be affected. The result will inevitably cause unnecessary sacrifice of the people's lives and property. Such manpower and materials that could be preserved during the war, if they are destroyed now that peace has been realized, will damage the vitality of the country. I hope that the people of all walks of life will be careful not to act rashly and cause harm to the region. They should assist the military and police, maintain security, and return everything in this region to the central government intact, and obey the orders of Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek, which is what is sincerely hoped."

Deputy Commander Luo Issues Emergency Order

Mr. Luo Junqiang has been ordered by Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek to be the Deputy Commander of the Shanghai Action Headquarters of the Military Affairs Commission. Yesterday, it was learned that Mr. Luo issued an emergency order to all officers and the entire Baojia (system of neighborhood watch and control) personnel in the city, in order to concentrate police force and strengthen the city's security. The original order is recorded below:

Mr. Zhou Fohai has been ordered by Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek to be the commander of the Shanghai Action Headquarters of the Military Affairs Commission. Director Mu Jianju is the deputy commander, and Deputy Director Man Qiwei is the commander of the Fifth Route. From now on, the Shanghai Action Headquarters will be fully responsible for Shanghai's security during the transitional period. All officers under this bureau and the entire Baojia personnel in the city should submit to the central government, obey the orders of Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek, and obey the command of the Shanghai Action Headquarters, and strive to do their job well. In order to concentrate police force and strengthen security, no officer or policeman may arbitrarily join any organization or have free actions without the permission of the director of this bureau. Those who violate this will be severely punished according to military law. This order is given.

### Police Bureau Orders Subordinates to Protect Various Warehouses

The Municipal Police Bureau, because it has found that the managers of the Showa Trading Suzhou River Warehouse and other warehouses in the city have disappeared, leaving a large amount of goods stored in the warehouses with no one responsible, has ordered the subordinate Hubei Branch to send police to guard them properly, awaiting handling by the authorities. It also ordered all subordinate branches that if similar incidents are found in their respective jurisdictions in the future, they should first send police to guard them, await handling, and report to the General Bureau for review. At the same time, they should also properly protect various warehouses on weekdays.

Adjust Japanese Staff

The Municipal Police Bureau will adjust the senior Japanese staff, effective immediately. The following changes are made: The Chief of the Second Division, Hiraoka Isamu; the Chief of the Fourth Division, Sugihara Eichi; the Chief of the Fire Department, Iwasaki Masao; and the Commander of the Police Force, Kobayashi Minetaro, will all be reassigned to other positions.

Free Talk

### Introductory Remarks

— Editor

"Free Talk" has a history of over thirty years, having been founded in 1911. It temporarily ceased publication on August 13th of the year before last. Today, it is revived and meets with its esteemed readers once again, bringing both joy and comfort. Although only two years have passed, readers who cherish this space must have been thinking about it deeply! As evidenced by the nearly one hundred submissions received within two days of announcing the resumption of publication, most expressing warm congratulations and joy.

Our perspective will not dwell on reminiscing about the past, but will focus on critical analysis of the present and inspiration for the future, always standing at the forefront of the times to avoid falling behind. "Free Talk" will freely discuss thoughts, observations, and experiences, provided they are beneficial to the public. This is the character of "Free Talk".

This platform is absolutely open to all, welcoming old friends and new acquaintances alike. The content of submissions will be carefully selected with an objective viewpoint. This is the selection principle of "Free Talk".

Therefore, in order to make this land bear fruit, we rely on the cultivation and nourishment of old friends and new acquaintances, and the enthusiastic support of our readers. The editor, standing in a humble position, will of course spare no effort in its nurturing and maintenance.

Finally, we are more than willing to humbly accept any well-intentioned criticism and guidance on our work.

### Welcoming a New Era

— Wei Ziyang

The days of destruction and suffering have finally passed, and everyone is looking forward to the arrival of happiness. At this moment, people's joy is truly difficult to describe in words. From now on, a bright and promising new era lies before us. This era is no longer one of deep water and scorching fire, but one filled with vibrant vitality. This era will advance under the construction of people who love peace around the world.

From the rubble, our nation has stood up strong. However, today, with the war over, in the midst of joy, everyone cannot help but sigh at the difficult days of the past eight years. Everyone can imagine that across our entire land, there are still broken walls and ruins everywhere, everywhere there are deep wounds in need of healing, everywhere, our compatriots struggling on the brink of starvation and cold due to the war are still enduring suffering. The blood and tears that fill history are beyond description. Everyone can cry out: "War is ultimately cruel!"

Therefore, we, who have been reborn from the ashes of calamity, have learned a lesson from the facts, and its conclusion places a great mission upon our shoulders, because the difficult times have not yet passed.

In this era, it is not easy for our country to stand firm and stand forever. It requires great construction strength and the united efforts of the entire nation to unleash that strength. People living in the newly reborn China can no longer be content with temporary ease, self-seeking, and self-interest. As construction work is just beginning today, we should calmly consider how to be worthy of being citizens of the new China. That is, we should make a resolution to dedicate everything we have to work for the country, for all mankind, and to do some construction work for lasting peace, laying a solid and unbreakable cornerstone, so that our country can stand strong and powerful, and the world can be forever peaceful and tranquil. Otherwise, if everyone does not resolve to prioritize restoration and construction, the country will still weaken and inevitably fall into an abyss of suffering.

Therefore, on this day when we joyfully shout the slogans of victory, we must add a sentence: "Let's all resolve to revive China! Build China!"

### Congratulations on the Re-publication

— Xin Wei'ai

Following closely on the heels of victory, "Free Talk" has been re-published.

"Free Talk" has had a glorious history, especially around 1933, when it was at its peak. Many writers with foresight and insight, aware of the urgency of the internal and external situation, although they knew that the so-called "freedom" at that time was just the opposite, in order to be free and unfettered, talking about everything, the result was bound to hit walls on all sides. But they still expressed their opinions on the situation at the time through various literary and artistic forms. At that time, many cautious people thought that these opinions were too radical and focused on personal attacks, which was too disrespectful to others. However, this caution was obviously superfluous. In these eight years, the internal and external situation has changed drastically every moment, and the appearance of various new and old dregs has proved the correctness of those writers' opinions.

Correct opinions, opinions that can be confirmed at any time in the future, are completely rooted in being able to have a thorough and correct understanding of the objective situation. Closing your eyes and guessing and talking nonsense, without considering the facts, there is no correctness in saying it, let alone proving it in the future. The reason why "Free Talk" has such a glorious history is entirely due to this point.

I hope that the re-published "Free Talk" will not only be able to continue to maintain this glory, but also be able to carry it forward even more!

### Waking Up from a Nightmare

— Lin Yi

The long years, the endless nights; were a series of nightmarish days.

Eight years! These long years, these endless nights; these days of never-ending nightmares!

Half of the territory changed color, and tragic events were staged anytime and anywhere. How many figures will I use to calculate the material and spiritual losses of my compatriots!

Speculation, hoarding, profiteering, manipulation; stirring up trouble, seeking only personal gain, regardless of the suffering of others, filling every corner of society.

The decadent music of national subjugation, like bacteria, spread everywhere, indulging in pleasure and corrupting many promising young people.

Ah! This series of never-ending nightmares.

A burst of firecrackers startled me from my nightmare and opened my eyes; ah! It's dawn.

People are cheering, shouting, a new era has come, freedom, light; happy days have arrived.

The long night is over, the nightmare is over.

I forgot my shape and cheered, shouted; jumped and stomped.

### Disorganized Newspapers

— Chen Wei

World peace will actually become a reality, which is something no one could have expected. After all, national flags are flying everywhere, and everyone naturally reveals a knowing excitement in calmness.

What best shows the different atmosphere is the newspaper. Before the ceasefire treaty was signed and before the Kuomintang army arrived, people in the city gave up reading small newspapers, which they usually regarded as entertainment, and would rather buy a so-called "extra" at a black market price.

The "Justice Daily", "Huguan Daily", "Renovation Daily", "Wenhui Daily", and many other publications will be found in every corner of Shanghai, which can naturally prove the prosperity of publications, and is perhaps something to be proud of.

However, in the newspapers of the 18th, there was a "statement": the main idea was that "The joint announcement published in the "Justice Daily" on the 17th was falsely used to promote it. In addition to investigation, the newspaper is temporarily suspended first." It is evident that it has not been completely separated from the transitional era, but the occurrence of such unfortunate events will have a great bad impression on the people who have great expectations for "Justice".

The author believes that before Greater Shanghai is completely restored, why are so many newspapers needed? This has instead become "disorganized".

### Announcement of the Re-publication of Free Talk

— Qing Ping

During the long eight years of the Anti-Japanese War, it was like having a frightening nightmare. All kinds of demons and monsters showed their teeth and claws, revealing their true colors, strangling throats and sucking blood, making people's hearts and livers crack and unbearable. Suddenly, there was a hurricane and rainstorm, uprooting trees and flying houses; suddenly, there were huge waves, washing away houses. However, this was precisely the battle between reason and arrogance, the war between justice and wildness. Except for those with weak wills, in the sound of a rooster crowing and the world turning white, in the shouts of victory, victory, they finally woke up from this nightmare.

The national emblem of the blue sky and white sun, with a smile, fluttered in the breeze, as if saying: "Poor compatriots, the frightening nightmare has passed, and the final victory has finally been achieved by us. Come, come into my arms, let me hug you, let me kiss your forehead."

Our bright and splendid free garden with a long history has been deserted for a long time. Now that justice has finally been won, our free garden is happily returning to the embrace of nature.

Work hard! Spread the seeds of culture as much as possible in this glorious garden, let it bloom more beautiful buds than before, and bear more bright and splendid fruits to offer to readers. Work hard! Cultural comrades!

### Tears of Victory

— Zhang Peng

In the dimly lit room at night. "You can't but agree to this marriage, you have to think about your parents from the bottom of your heart!" Dad puffed a thick smoke at the glass window opposite, turned his face and said half-threateningly and half-warmly: "Ruizhen, what time is it now, you can't pick and choose! You have to be considerate, not to mention you should treat your poor parents very thoughtfully!" Seeing his daughter sitting slanting on the sofa with her head buried and unresponsive, he threw the half-cigarette butt fiercely into the spittoon by the table leg: "To put it bluntly, now when girls get married, what they care about is wealth, regardless of what 'common appearance is not outstanding', as long as life is good! Who is like you, so stubborn, so wishful thinking! I know you can't let go of that poor kid! I'm not going to say anything about life and death to you now, I'll give you five minutes to think, you hear? I'll give you the last five minutes to consider, yes or no? You have to answer me!" He turned his angry face to the blue starry sky outside the window.

Ruizhen was still silently burying her face, not speaking, the tide of emotion attacking her weak heart in waves, and her eyes had already begun to moisten.

"Ruizhen, Dad can't do anything either, you have to listen to Dad," Mom stopped the sewing work in her hand and said in a comforting voice: "Just bear with it, agree to Dad, agree to Dad!"

"Bear with it? I don't agree!" Ruizhen dropped her tears: "I can't let my pure soul be tainted by vulgar people, Mom, this, this... I can't agree no matter what!..."

"You're rebelling, you're rebelling, you're actually rebelling against your parents' orders! Have you forgotten the hardships your parents have endured to raise you!" Dad suddenly turned his very terrible expression, and said angrily: "If you don't listen to Dad, I can't make things difficult for you. If you want to take the free and ideal path you want, go, leave immediately! Leave your parents immediately! Go be with that poor ghost!"

Ruizhen cried, crying softly and miserably.

"Dad!" The younger brother couldn't stand it anymore next to him, dropped the book, and said excitedly: "Dad, marriage is a matter of personal freedom, and my sister's opposition has a full reason to mourn, and cannot be said to be resisting orders. Besides, I don't like the person who wants to be my 'brother-in-law' either. It's okay if his face is ugly, but what he does is not very upright, and the money he earns is the people's fat and cream. If you want my sister to agree, I certainly don't... a hundred times I don't want to!"

"Little devil!" Dad shouted: "Don't interrupt! What do you know?"

"I don't know! Look! Who is the one who doesn't know?" The younger brother, with a bit of fear in his strength, picked up the brush again to do his homework. However, he was unconvinced with his father's strong reason, and said softly: "Sister is innocent, and our family is innocent. We can't forget the stench of humiliation just because we are poor."

"It's almost dawn, and you still want to force me to take this dirty path of self-destruction." Ruizhen listened to her brother's righteousness and affection. The excited emotion, the weak shadow faded, and the firm posture showed a faint sunlight on her half-wet tearful cheeks.

一

"Nonsense! Nonsense!" Dad's fist hit the corner of the table with a ping-pong, and he said fiercely: "Disobedient! I have to beat you!"

"Dad! Dad! Good news has come!" The older brother ran upstairs with a thump, rushed into the room, his face overflowing with an expression of excitement, and his tone full of joy: "China has won, China has finally won! Japan has accepted the Potsdam Declaration! Peace! World peace has been achieved!..."

"Really?" Dad's anger and indignation diminished invisibly, and he said in surprise: "Don't talk nonsense! Did you hear someone's rumor?"

"Brother, is it true?" The younger brother said happily.

Because Ruizhen had just been heartbroken, there was no joy on her face, but there was a ball of happiness in her heart.

"Look! This is the extra that just came out!" The older brother threw a sixteen-open newspaper on the center of the table familiarly.

"Eight years! The Chinese people have suffered from eight years of war! It's rare to be away from the poisonous life of deep water and scorching fire now. It's really a happy day!" Mom said half-sighing and half-laughing.

"Hey! Sister Zhen, why are you crying!?" The older brother saw the tears on her left face and walked over strangely: "Did Dad scold you?"

"No," Ruizhen said lightly: "I heard good news and I'm too happy."

"Too happy," the older brother said thoughtfully, his face full of smiles: "Zhen, your emotions are too excited! You cry when you are sad, and you cry when you are happy."

"Your sister is too happy, so happy that she even shed tears." Dad covered up: "Good news! How can you not be happy, how can you not cry!?"

Ruizhen smiled lightly.

Dad also smiled shyly.

Mom and brother naturally also smiled slightly.

The older brother smiled even more slightly.

So, everyone smiled happily, talking and commenting with great interest on the causes and consequences of peace and victory on the "extra".
