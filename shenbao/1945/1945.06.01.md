### Okinawa Island Heavy Rain and Mud, Fierce Battle Underway on All Fronts, Japanese Army, Navy, and Air Force Continue to Attack as One

Ryukyu Islands, May 31st, Central News Agency - The enemy's attack targets in the southern part of Okinawa Island are gradually directed towards the Japanese army's positions south of Shuri. Since the 15th, enemy artillery and naval gun fire have become increasingly intense, with shells mostly concentrated in the areas south of Yonabaru and Shuri, and north of Ōshiro and Ita. The focus of ground combat on the 28th was in the Komesu area for Ōzato and Miyagi, in front of Shuri in the central area for Ishimine and Ōna, and southeast of Naha in the western area. Japanese garrison troops, under the cover of artillery, repeatedly charged into enemy positions, engaging in fierce battles along the entire front line amidst a rain of fire and mud.

Ryukyu Islands Base, May 31st, Central News Agency - The Japanese Army, Navy, and Air Force, after launching a general offensive against enemy ships near Okinawa Island on the 28th, resumed attacks on the 30th despite adverse weather conditions. On the morning of the same day, two enemy ships of unidentified type were sunk, one was destroyed, and one was heavily damaged. In the evening, a special attack was carried out, plunging into the enemy fleet, hitting one enemy aircraft carrier or cruiser, one destroyer, and four ships of unidentified type. The Japanese forces also launched night raids on airfields on the main island, Ie Island, and the Kerama Islands, inflicting great damage on the enemy. As a result, no enemy planes attacked Okinawa Island on the afternoon of the 30th, and only about 80 planes attacked the island chain area.

Tokyo, May 31st, Central News Agency - On Okinawa Island, the Japanese and American forces remain in a stalemate along the line from Nakagusuku Bay and the vicinity of Yonabaru on the east coast, through the north of Shuri, to the outskirts of Naha. The battle line is in a state of deadlock. However, the fighting is becoming increasingly fierce, with both sides engaging in close combat along a front line of over ten kilometers east to west, without a moment's respite. Since the enemy launched its fourth offensive on the 21st, more than ten days have passed. If the enemy advances one foot, the Japanese army will seize one inch, engaging in a back-and-forth fierce battle. Observing the land battle on Okinawa Island, the combat has evolved from a single line to a multiple line operation in the past few days. When the enemy launched its third offensive on the 21st, it focused its attack on the two coasts facing Naha and Shuri, but it was met with a fierce counterattack by the Japanese side. In just a few days of fighting, the two divisions of the first line were almost annihilated, with casualties reaching 20,000, and their offensive was thwarted. Therefore, the fourth offensive avoided the Japanese army's frontal positions and placed its main attack target on the east coast. After attacking Yonabaru, it further threatened the flanks of the Japanese army's positions centered on Naha and Shuri, isolating the Japanese army's complex defense lines. In recent days, the enemy's operations have become more complex, still implementing the main attack from the east coast. They are also attempting to break through the Japanese army's lines from the central zone between Naha and Shuri and several other locations. The enemy's troop strength landed on Okinawa Island is currently four army divisions and four marine divisions, totaling eight divisions. It seems that the enemy is rotating half of its forces on the front line, but in recent days, they have added reserve divisions, launching repeated attacks with their entire landed force on the front line. Therefore, the Japanese army's battle line has also gradually formed a complex line with uneven and intertwined protrusions. On the 24th, the Japanese Giretsu Airborne Unit landed at the enemy's northern and central airfields, suppressing the activities of the enemy's base air force. Subsequently, the special attack force is now exerting all its strength to attack the enemy fleet around the island, which is also gradually becoming fierce, inflicting heavy damage. However, the fierce force of the Japanese special attack force has not yet been able to cut off the enemy's supply lines, and the American ground forces are still supported by a strong supply line.

Lisbon, May 31st, Central News Agency - A dispatch from Daito Island reports that U.S. Pacific Fleet Commander Nimitz announced on the 29th that the damage suffered by the U.S. Navy in the waters off Okinawa, from the evening of May 27th to the 28th, included one U.S. warship sunk by Japanese aircraft, and twelve other Pacific Fleet vessels damaged.

### Japanese Aircraft Conduct Night Bombing of Tarakan

Southern Front Airfield, May 31st, Central News Agency - The Japanese Air Force conducted continuous night bombing raids on enemy positions in Tarakan on the 27th, 28th, and 29th. On moonlit nights, they approached enemy positions and simultaneously attacked and bombed enemy airfields, cargo accumulation points, and landing facilities, etc. The enemy was thrown into a state of confusion, and no enemy aircraft were seen to take off.

Southwest Pacific Base, May 31st, Central News Agency - On Tarakan Island, the Japanese and American forces are still facing each other at close range, with no progress being made, and no major changes in the fighting. The 28th was extremely quiet. On the morning of the 29th, the American forces resumed their intense attacks with bombers, naval guns, and other firearms. The Japanese army also sent several teams of melee troops deep into enemy positions, killing or wounding more than 130 enemy soldiers, capturing seven automatic rifles, destroying three barracks, and one light machine gun.

Southwest Pacific Base, May 31st, Central News Agency - On the morning of the 16th, the enemy forces strengthened their pressure on the Japanese army's first-line positions northeast of Tarakan Airfield. The Japanese army also launched a courageous counterattack, inflicting great losses on the enemy. Later, considering the effectiveness of the operation, they reorganized a part of the positions. The Japanese army in the Amur area launched a fierce attack on the main force of the attacking enemy army, inflicting heavy damage. On the 12th and 13th, the enemy army was annihilated by a Japanese army assault team, and a large number of weapons and ammunition were captured. They further cut off the advance route of the enemy's follow-up troops, defeating them and placing their own troops in a dominant position in the operation.

### Japanese Aircraft Factory Production Rate Increases

Tokyo, May 31st, Central News Agency - In order to significantly maintain and cultivate the production of aircraft during air raids, based on the Outline of Emergency Measures for Specific Aircraft Factories decided by the cabinet meeting on March 2nd, the Japanese government transferred a part of the factories to state-owned operation on April 1st, using the military factories under the Ministry of Munitions as a starting point. The subsequent production rate has increased significantly. The production in April increased by [redacted] percent compared to March, and the production in May showed an even greater increase compared to April. The reasons are as follows: 1. All workers and students, from the cadres down, have clearly recognized the concept of state-owned operation, and their enthusiasm for labor has been significantly increased. 2. The coordination of various operations and external negotiations in the military factory is smoother, etc. The establishment of military factories is based on the fact that, under the large-scale enemy air raids, the protection, evacuation, and dispersion of factories, the establishment of underground factories, and the securing of transportation of labor and materials, if operated by the original private sector, may not be able to adapt to the war situation. Therefore, it was decided to ensure the production of aircraft under a new official-private integrated mechanism.

### Davies's Mission to England

Tokyo, May 31st, Central News Agency - The Stockholm correspondent of the Mainichi Shimbun, Mr. Hongs, reported on Truman's special envoy Davies's mission to England as follows: Davies's first mission is to persuade Churchill not to adopt a policy of competing with the Soviet Union in Europe. The United States has fully recognized the Soviet Union's attitude and penetration in the European continent, and knows that it is no longer possible to change it. Therefore, it requires Britain to also recognize this fact and take the same measures as the United States. When Davies visits London, Hopkins will go to Moscow and take the same course of action as Davies, persuading Stalin to be tolerant of Soviet demands within possible limits so that Britain can easily accept them. Davies further explained to Churchill that the United States is well aware that Britain is extremely concerned about the Soviet Union's activities in Europe, but the United States' own interests in East Asia are even more important. Therefore, the United States cannot abandon its own interests and get involved in European conflicts.

### Wavell to Return to India Soon, India Firmly Demands Independence

Lisbon, May 31st, Central News Agency - The leader of the British Labour Party, Attlee, declared when the election campaign was about to begin that he would immediately grant India dominion status. However, according to a dispatch from San Francisco, Nehru's sister, Miss Pandit, stated on the 28th that India is not a dominion and demands independence. Pandit said that if the British Labour Party wins the election in the future, it will be of no great significance other than granting India dominion status. Although the fascist system in Europe has collapsed, British imperialism, which is very similar to the fascist system, continues to exist. We do not understand why India is not given its natural independence. Why are India's leaders arrested and not tried? The Soviet Union's full cooperation for India's independence has made the Indian people infinitely grateful.

### Spanish Labor Party Advocates Overthrowing Franco

Democratic countries around the world must sever diplomatic relations with the Franco regime. Convene the parliament to reorganize a constitutional government. The world's democratic countries must formally recognize this temporary new government.

Editorial

### The Crazy Rise in Rice Prices and Agricultural Loan Work

In the most recent ten days, the surge in rice prices has reached a frantic state. Before [redacted], the price of rice per dan (unit of dry measure) was still hovering around ten yuan, but since then it has risen daily, and has now broken through thirty yuan or more. As a result, the prices of other commodities have also risen in a tidal wave. Regarding this price fluctuation, the editorial board of this newspaper pointed out two major characteristics on May 28th: 1. It is led by the crazy jump in rice prices in the countryside and small cities; 2. It began during the season when rice and grain are running out. As a result, there are two crises: 1. The inflationary wave has spread almost throughout the entire peaceful area; 2. It is not cyclical, but has a sustained nature; Therefore, its threat to people's livelihood and even social order is even more serious!

Considering the formation factors of this price surge centered on rice, there are many factors, and the most fundamental one is the shortage of rice. Because of the shortage of rice, the approach of the lean season has further aroused social panic, and promoted a straight-line rise in rice prices - followed by a general rise in prices. Therefore, the way to save is to increase production, so that the supply of rice can fully meet the needs, so as to remove the cause of stimulating price increases and solve most of the problem of people's livelihood.

In recent years, the food of the city has to be obtained nearby because long-distance transportation is not convenient, so it is especially expected that rice-producing areas in Jiangsu Province will increase production. Therefore, it is necessary to provide full assistance to the economic difficulties of farmers in Jiangsu Province so as to alleviate them. Based on this significance, the Municipal Advisory Committee specially formed an agricultural loan syndicate to be responsible for raising 500 million yuan to lend to farmers in the rice-producing areas of Jiangsu Province. It has now been agreed that the funds will be raised by early June, and the Jiangsu Provincial Government will be entrusted with the full authority to handle the lending. In the future, when the new harvest is available, rice will be shipped to Shanghai to repay the principal and interest (see this newspaper on May 23). Regarding this move, this newspaper's editorials on April 16th and 28th have discussed and explained that its significance lies in: 1. Alleviating the suffering of farmers from high-interest loans, supplying them with production capital, so as to save the rural economy and promote increased production; 2. Guiding urban idle funds to flow into rural areas, so as to combat the wind of speculation and profiteering, and reduce the force of price increases. As for its methods: 1. When raising funds, please ask the rich to invest (not donate) as much as possible to save people and themselves; 2. When lending, the main goal is to lend directly to farmers at low interest rates, so as to eliminate the exploitation of intermediaries; 3. Loans are not limited to currency, but can also be replaced by farming tools and grain seeds; 4. When repaying, rice will be shipped to Shanghai to regulate the city's food supply. If this matter is handled properly, farmers can be relieved a little, and a solution to Shanghai's livelihood problem can also be obtained, which is truly a win-win situation. It is reported that the Central Trust of China has provided a great deal of assistance in this fundraising for agricultural loans.

However, as of today, the farming season has arrived, and all loans need to be raised quickly. It is still hoped that all powerful people will take the initiative to invest together. Under this high price situation, the faster the better, otherwise, if the food problem is always so serious, it may cause famine riots, and social order may be disturbed.

Finally, here are a few more hopes: 1. Those responsible for implementing the fundraising, lending, and repayment of agricultural loans must be selfless, hardworking, and meticulous; 2. Please ask the relevant authorities to cooperate with this agricultural loan work, and make every effort to rectify rural order, and eliminate all theft, extortion, gambling and other things; and distribute excellent varieties and appropriate tools as soon as possible, and mobilize agricultural talents to go to the countryside to guide increased production technology; so as to make the increased production work proceed smoothly and achieve the greatest effect. 3. During this period of soaring rice prices, the authorities should be asked to quickly find ways to regulate rice and grain in various places in order to curb its rise; at the same time, it is hoped that the people will save rice and grain as much as possible and use more miscellaneous grains, and it is especially necessary to strictly prevent miscellaneous grains from taking the opportunity to increase prices.

Regarding the rice and grain problem, it is harmful and useless to hold a panic mentality. What we should pay attention to is how to implement practical solutions, which is the fundamental way!

Translation of Opinion

### The Moral Righteousness of Agricultural Loans

The plan of the Shanghai Municipal Advisory Committee to mobilize Shanghai's private capital to lend to the rice-producing areas of Jiangsu has been mentioned many times, and we have also pointed out its importance. Fortunately, the preparations in Shanghai are nearing completion, and it will soon be lent to farmers. Not only will farmers in the rice-producing areas be overjoyed, but all those who care about China's agricultural interests and farmers will feel gratified.

The greatest significance of the 5 billion yuan agricultural loan lies in the correct understanding by Shanghai's powerful people of the inseparability of Shanghai and the local areas, and the deep understanding that in order to solve Shanghai's food problem, it is necessary to cooperate with the rice-producing areas to increase agricultural production, and this has been put into practice. In his letter to the Governor of Jiangsu Province, Mr. Li Sihao specifically clarified this point, and mentioned that the solution to Shanghai's food problem must wait for the increase in production in the rice-producing areas of Jiangsu, and therefore it is even more necessary to alleviate the suffering of farmers. These words are appropriate. Furthermore, it is more precious that the knowledge and office circles and the financial circles of Shanghai can take this into consideration and express their attitude of sharing the suffering of Jiangsu farmers than the economic effects obtained after the implementation of agricultural loans.

The economic significance of agricultural loans has been discussed many times. It can not only open up a way for urban idle funds, but also prevent the deterioration of inflation. At the same time, providing farmers with production funds is enough to increase the agricultural and farmers' welfare. From this point of view, this move is indeed a win-win situation. Although the impact of the 5 billion agricultural loan on Shanghai's economy is still difficult to quantify, it is worth noting how significant a role this fund will play in rural areas. It is expected that the Jiangsu Provincial Government will be able to fulfill its responsibilities and truly distribute the agricultural loan funds to farmers at low interest rates. Furthermore, the lofty political morality shown in the deployment of agricultural loan funds will surely be shown again in the process of lending them. Therefore, farmers will have unlimited well-being, and there is no doubt.

Regarding the terms of the agricultural loan, Shanghai has almost no conditions, and the attitude of entrusting the Jiangsu Provincial authorities with full power to handle it, and the Jiangsu Province has also expressed its willingness to actively cooperate to solve Shanghai's food problem, are all worthy of special mention. The fact that this agricultural loan is implemented without the use of an abacus is enough to show the morality of both parties. This lofty moral concept will surely be consistent throughout the lending process of agricultural loans and when they are returned.

When this agricultural loan is implemented, what we hope for first is to make full use of the cooperatives that can now best grasp agriculture, and second, the Wuxi and Changshu areas, which are now attracting attention from the general public, should be used as key areas for agricultural loans and actively loaned. The Jiangsu Provincial Government is of course very familiar with the local situation, and without our hope, the above two points should also be realized; however, from the nature of agricultural loans, these two points should also be hoped for. Agricultural loans, in their essence, are a strong link linking Shanghai and the rice-producing areas of Jiangsu, and are very moral in nature. This is what we especially feel when agricultural loans are put into practice. (Mainland News, May 30)

### Okinawa's Heavy Rains Impede Enemy Advance; Military Commentator Discusses Recent Battle Situation

Regarding the recent battle situation on Okinawa Island, due to the impact of the rainy season, although Japanese and American forces are engaged in fierce fighting, both sides are finding it difficult to make progress. A military commentator in this city provides a detailed observation of the recent situation on Okinawa Island.

Rainy Season Hinders Land Warfare

On the battle front: Currently, intense artillery battles continue on the outskirts of Naha and Shuri. Enemy British and American forces are suffering increasing casualties, and enemy war leaders also acknowledge that future bloodshed will become even more substantial. However, recently, continuous heavy rain in that area has made progress difficult for both Japanese and American forces. In the last ten days of May alone, rainfall exceeded six inches. It is expected that the rainfall will become even more intense after the beginning of June, so it is believed that there will be no significant progress in the fighting between Japanese and American forces in the next three weeks. According to a report from the Associated Press correspondent dispatched from Okinawa on the 29th, the mud in Naha is unprecedented, leaving no means of transportation other than walking. The correspondent also claimed to have walked several miles and witnessed more than a dozen American tanks destroyed by the Japanese army along the way. Currently, American troops marching towards the outskirts of Shuri, including medics and howitzer units, must walk. Although there are returning transport vehicles, they are full of soldiers who have died in battle.

Enemy Ships Suffer Losses Exceeding Ten Vessels

On the sea front, Japanese special attack units continue to brave adverse weather to strike the enemy. According to enemy reports, since the 28th and 29th, Japanese forces have launched extremely fierce attacks on their ships, damaging more than ten enemy vessels. The enemy is experiencing unexpected fear of Japanese special attack units, and various reports describe their long-term capabilities. According to a recent broadcast from San Francisco, Okinawa Island is quite far from the American mainland compared to Iwo Jima. Okinawa is 375 nautical miles from the Japanese mainland and 4,600 nautical miles from Pearl Harbor. Therefore, American forces are fighting under a heavy burden due to this inverse proportion. It is truly difficult for the American fleet to annihilate the Japanese fleet under these unfavorable conditions. It is particularly noteworthy that repeated attacks by Japanese aircraft are damaging American ships, and the United States is facing extreme difficulties in replenishing ships. The number of ships lost in the waters off Okinawa on the 24th and 25th alone is clearly evident. Although American forces dispatched aircraft to defend themselves in the air and used naval guns to resist Japanese aircraft attacks, they still lost more than ten ships. Therefore, it is difficult to guarantee the safety of United Nations ships. If the damage suffered by the United States on Okinawa cannot be addressed by reinforcing troops in that area, it will be difficult for British and American forces to secure an ideal forward base on the Pacific front in the future.

Special Attack Unit Members Kill a Hundred Each

The achievements of the Japanese special attack units, with the heroic sacrifice of 440 young members, have inflicted the following damage on the enemy: A total of 29 vessels sunk, including three regular aircraft carriers, two battleships, two cruisers, three destroyers, one unidentified type of warship, and eighteen transport ships. A total of 54 vessels damaged, including seven regular aircraft carriers, one escort carrier, six battleships, nine cruisers, one destroyer, one torpedo boat, one unidentified type of warship, and eighteen transport ships. Regarding enemy personnel losses, based on the lowest estimates of 50% casualties for sunken vessels and 30% for damaged vessels, the U.S. Navy has suffered at least 33,075 casualties. There are still many unconfirmed achievements of the special attack units that are not included in this count. According to this explicit report, the sacrifice of 440 members of the Japanese special attack units annihilated more than 30,000 enemy sailors, with each person killing an average of 75 enemies, effectively killing a hundred each. Japan has millions of heroic young people with the spirit of courageously killing the enemy, and we can confidently achieve final victory.

Fierce Battles Continue on Various Luzon Islands

Battle situation in the Southwest Pacific: The battles on Luzon Island are currently raging in the areas of Santa Fe and Cagayan. Fierce fighting continues in Malaybalay in the interior of Mindanao. In Burma, there is fierce fighting in the area of Pyay on the Waw road, 32 kilometers southeast of Yangon, and southeast of Mengdong on the Irrawaddy River. The Japanese garrison on Tarakan is currently engaging the enemy in landing battles. Regarding the aforementioned combat situation in the Southwest Pacific, the Japanese army is temporarily refraining from taking proactive actions due to supply constraints. However, on each battlefield, they are skillfully luring the enemy with large forces, aiming to inflict massive casualties.

Full Preparations for Landing Operations

According to a Washington dispatch dated May 28th, the U.S. Navy Department announced on that day that the composite Task Force 88, a powerful U.S. Navy escort carrier task force with strong naval tactics and air power, had completed its mission after three large-scale amphibious operations and eight months of combat in the Pacific and is now returning home for rest. However, the actions of this unit and its future operational intentions are still difficult to predict. However, according to a London dispatch dated the 28th, the Japanese military command is now preparing to respond to new actions by the main forces of British and American armies based on realistic considerations. The Japanese army has also prepared new deployments to deal with future attempted landings by the British and Americans on the coasts of China or the Japanese mainland. In addition, Graham, a special correspondent stationed in Chongqing, also criticized the mainland operations, with subtle implications in his words. However, in the future battle situation, we should also be vigilant.

American Production Shifts to Civilian Needs

Furthermore, a broadcast from San Francisco on the 30th stated that the United States has tightened military production. Krug, Director of the U.S. War Production Board, estimated that the price has been reduced to 7 billion U.S. dollars, but it will still need to be supplemented if large quantities of materials are required. At the same time, personnel, materials, and industrial productivity have considerable strength to enhance civilian needs production. The current environment of peace and tranquility in the United States is the reason for promoting the transfer of production to civilian needs. According to an announcement by the U.S. Army Air Headquarters on the 28th, the Fairlea factory, with a capital of one million dollars, will stop production of the four-engine B-24 aircraft from June 15th.

International Disputes in Continental Europe and the Near East

Recent changes in the international situation, such as France's sudden shift to the left, are vastly different from the right-wing Franco regime in Spain. Therefore, the future relationship between France and Spain is worthy of attention. Furthermore, party struggles in Italy are becoming increasingly prominent. Turning our eyes eastward, we see the complex situation in Syria and Lebanon due to the relationship between Britain and France. Since the end of the First World War, international disputes have been common. The recent reports of the Syria-Lebanon incident are becoming more tense. British Foreign Secretary Eden stated in the House of Commons on May 29th that the Syria-Lebanon incident hinders the progress of the war against Japan and cannot allow its expansion. He called on all parties to exercise serious restraint, saying that French forces had increased their troop presence in Syria by only 500 men, and the British government is actively consulting with the French government. The conflicts in the Middle East will affect transportation lines to East Asia. Prime Minister Eden also announced the next day that Britain is in discussions with France to resolve the Syria-Lebanon incident. On that day, Syrian acting Prime Minister Jamali met with the British and American ambassadors for consultations and held a special cabinet meeting. At a time when the European war has just ended, complex disputes are emerging endlessly. Even if this Second World War ends, it is difficult to guarantee that it will not trigger a Third World War.

### Strengthen Air Defense Facilities Week Commences Today; Urge Citizens to Cooperate in Air Defense and Encourage Well Digging

The city's Civil Air Defense Headquarters will implement "Strengthen Air Defense Facilities Week" starting today (1st) to thoroughly strengthen air defense equipment, urging the public to cooperate in air defense tasks and strengthen air defense facilities. Regardless of fire prevention equipment, air defense equipment, and lighting control equipment, all must automatically check and strive for perfection in accordance with the key points stipulated by the headquarters. The headquarters will also send personnel to inspect households. Those who perform well will be rewarded, and those who are deficient will be corrected and reformed. At the same time, to encourage well digging, citizens who dig artesian wells during the "Strengthen Air Defense Facilities Week" from today (1st) to the 9th will have their costs specially reduced as agreed upon by the headquarters and various well-digging companies. It is hoped that citizens will respond and strive to make the city's air defense posture more perfect and strong.

Air Defense Water Pond Replacement Measures

The air defense water ponds built in various places in this city should be replaced with fresh water frequently as summer approaches. However, because the consumption of tap water is currently subject to strict restrictions, the fines for exceeding the limit are very high, resulting in a lack of attention to replacing the water in these air defense water ponds. It is now learned that the authorities have contacted the water and electricity company and reached an agreement. All air defense water ponds can replace water three times a month, and the required amount of water will still be calculated at ordinary prices. However, before doing so, a form should be filled out, stating the location of the water pond and the volume of the water pond (cubic meters), and submitted to the chief of the Lianbao for verification before applying to the water and electricity company. The application locations are: For the old District 1, at the Huazhong Water and Electricity Company on Jiangxi Road; at the Shanghai Water Branch, the Huazhong Water and Electricity North Sichuan Road Business Office in Hongkou and Zhabei; at the Huazhong Water and Electricity South City Business Office on Zhonghua Road in the South City; and at the French Concession Waterworks on Lingshi Road in the old District 8.

Various Cinemas Screen Slides

In addition, for the purpose of expanding publicity, the Civil Air Defense Headquarters has produced a film slide for the Air Defense Strengthening Promotion Week, which contains detailed information on the construction methods of personal air defense trenches in emergencies, etc. Starting today, all major theaters in the city will screen the slides, and at the same time, the significance of strengthening air defense facilities will be broadcast.

### Food Supply for This City Actively Being Purchased and Transported; Relevant Authorities Pledge Assistance

Regarding the issue of food supply for the people, according to the authorities in charge, they are currently actively purchasing and transporting food and have obtained the assistance of the relevant authorities, so there will be no shortage of rice. The recent surge in rice prices is entirely caused by unscrupulous merchants manipulating the market. The executive authorities are conducting a thorough investigation of unscrupulous merchants who hoard and speculate, and they will be severely punished according to the law.

Recently, local gold and silver jewelry trade associations have reported that the raw materials for manufacturing and selling gold and silver ornaments require adjustment and transportation between businesses in different locations, which involves many dangers along the way.

Therefore, the regulations for approving the transport of gold and silver passports clearly stipulate that when merchants and civilians apply, the person in charge must sign and affix their seal and obtain a guarantee from a reputable local store, which must be submitted to the ministry for approval and issuance. When gold and silver jewelry businesses apply, they must obtain a guarantee from the trade association with responsible certification, which must be submitted to the ministry for verification.
