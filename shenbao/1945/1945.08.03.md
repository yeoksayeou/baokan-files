### With the Japanese Army, Navy, and Air Force Integrated and Ready to Unleash Decisive Battle Power, Taiwan Has Also Completed Full Combat Readiness

Tokyo, 2nd (Central News Agency) – The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced on the 1st that the Imperial Army and Navy are gradually enhancing their decisive battle posture, the significance of which is extremely important. From this, we can see the new determination of the Imperial Army and Navy, which is an unprecedented and significant statement. Former Prime Minister Suzuki, when meeting with reporters, stated that the Chief of the General Staff and the Chief of the Naval General Staff had explained, "The current war situation is what the military is hoping for," which deeply impressed the nation. Both the former Prime Minister's statement and the government's announcement this time show that the Japanese military, under this intense battle, resolutely adheres to this important policy and is gradually strengthening its war preparations. The key to combat is definitely not to simply send troops to the front one after another, but to conduct combat with all decisive battle forces, and if necessary, to mobilize them all at once to determine victory. Japan's fundamental operational policy is based on this principle. Under the continuous enemy air raids, the Japanese army has repeatedly endured, automatically preparing for the decisive battle on the homeland with all its strength, waiting for the opportune moment. Once the military command is issued, it will unleash the Japanese army's prepared decisive battle power. At that time, on land, sea, and air, the enemy will surely suffer unprecedented strategic damage. It is still impossible to predict where the enemy will land. However, the Japanese side will utilize the geographical advantage of the homeland to launch mobile forces anytime, anywhere, and the domestic airports will also serve as forward bases to resist the enemy. Today, the Navy and Air Force are fully integrated, and they will surely annihilate and drive away the enemy in one fell swoop.

Southwest Front Base, 2nd (Central News Agency) – If the US military advances towards the mainland in the next operation, Taiwan's strategic position will be extremely important. Therefore, after the Battle of Leyte Gulf unfolded, the entire island of Taiwan completed its preparations for a complete combat posture. Since the enemy troops landed in Lingayen this year, they have been attacking and bombing Taiwan, and it has been more than half a year since they have continued to attack major cities non-stop, and even bombed villages and evacuated areas. However, Taiwan's resilience in terms of manpower and material resources is by no means comparable to Manila and Okinawa. Therefore, the enemy does not directly attack Taiwan, but only carries out daily bombings, attempting to reduce its combat power. However, Taiwan has completed a self-sufficient posture and has not been affected by the end of the Battle of Okinawa. It is not clear whether the enemy's next operation will involve landing in Taiwan. However, no matter what the situation is, Taiwan's army, navy, and air force, together with seven million islanders, have completely prepared all defensive facilities on the island and are now in a state of combat readiness.

Tokyo, 2nd (Central News Agency) – Approximately 300 B-29 aircraft, around 9:00 PM on the 1st, invaded the Japanese mainland in waves from the Boso and Izu peninsulas, targeting Toyama, Nagaoka, Hachioji, Kawasaki, Yokohama's Tsurumi Ward, and Mito City in Ibaraki Prefecture as their main targets, dropping incendiary bombs and bombs. They gradually withdrew towards the southern sea around 3:00 AM on the 2nd. The Japanese air force units launched interception warfare at that time and achieved considerable results. Detailed information is currently under investigation.

Osaka, 2nd (Central News Agency) – Around noon on the 2nd, approximately 40 P-51 aircraft invaded the Hanshin area from parts of Mie Prefecture and the prefectures of Aichi, Gifu, and Nara. Another 15 P-51 sorties attacked air bases and transportation facilities in the central and southern parts of Shiga Prefecture and the southwestern part of Osaka.

### Interception Warfare Results in the Kyushu Region

Fukuoka, 2nd (Central News Agency) – The results of the Japanese air force units' interception warfare against enemy aircraft that attacked the Kyushu region last month on the 30th were one large and one small aircraft shot down, and three large and two small aircraft damaged.

Fukuoka, 2nd (Central News Agency) – An enemy bombing and combat formation of approximately 80 small aircraft from the Okinawa base and 60 B-29 aircraft attacked Nagasaki Prefecture and Kagoshima Prefecture around 11:00 AM on the 1st, bombarding airfields, ships, and military facilities. The total number of enemy aircraft that attacked Kyushu on the 31st reached approximately 300.

### Hokkaido and Oshima Subjected to Shelling

Tokyo, 2nd (Central News Agency)

Around 2:30 PM on the 1st, three enemy submarines carried out naval bombardment of Yoichi in Hokkaido, with very minor damage on the Japanese side.

Tokyo, 2nd (Central News Agency) – Aircraft from an American task force attacked Izu Oshima in small formations from morning to around 10:00 AM on the 1st. At the same time, one enemy cruiser and three destroyers approached the island and carried out naval bombardment.

### Japanese Air Force Units Attack at Dawn, Fires Erupt at Okinawa Airfield

Tokyo, 2nd (Central News Agency) – On the 31st, Japanese air force units attacked enemy-held areas in Okinawa and enemy ships around the island at dawn, setting fire to nine enemy airfields and destroying one enemy vessel of unknown type and one transport ship.

### Intensifying Air Raids Require Extreme Vigilance

Forward Air Base, 2nd (Central News Agency) – The Okinawa base has been dispatching 470 to 500 aircraft daily to attack the Kyushu region, gradually expanding its sphere of activity. On the 24th and 25th of last month, in conjunction with the task force, some aircraft operated in the Chugoku region. Furthermore, on the 29th, P-51s and B-25s operated in South Korea. Judging from the operational status of these enemy aircraft, their operational radius is gradually increasing and is bound to expand. It can also be judged that the operational radius of the combined formations of B-24, B-25, P-51, and P-38 fighter-bombers is likely to be around 1,200 kilometers. Therefore, it is possible for them to attack the Chugoku region and the Hanshin area. In the future, there is a need for strict vigilance against the increasingly intensified attacks by the combined fighter-bomber formations departing from that base.

### Hundreds Killed and Wounded in Bombing of Makassar

Makassar, 2nd (Central News Agency) – At approximately 10:20 AM on the 1st, 13 B-24 aircraft invaded the outskirts of Makassar and dropped hundreds of bombs and incendiary bombs on the concentrated areas of Indonesian and overseas Chinese farmers, resulting in a large number of casualties among the indigenous people. As of now, 70 deaths and 200 injuries have been confirmed, presenting an extremely tragic scene.

Even from the standpoint of Buddhists, we are determined to work harder and cooperate with Japan in the future to achieve the Greater East Asia Holy War."

### Five Propaganda Groups Jointly Host Tea Party to Welcome and See Off Secretaries Matudaira and Katsuno

The Shanghai Branch of the China News Association, the China Broadcasting Association, the China Film Company, the Joint Magazine Association, and the Small Newspaper Association, among other five groups, jointly held a tea party yesterday (2nd) at 5:30 PM to bid farewell to former Information Minister Matudaira and welcome the newly appointed Secretary Katsuno of the Public Relations Department. Information Minister An of the Nanjing Embassy was also invited to attend. Representatives from the five groups and reporters from various newspapers, including Osaka Yoichi, Akahoshi Tamekazu, Moriyama Takashi, Kim Ung-baek, Chen Riben, Xu Liqu, Yuan Shu, Chen Binhe, Dai Linzao, Zhang Shichuan, Lu Feng, and Wang Xuechen, numbering over a hundred people, attended. After formal greetings, Chen Binhe, chairman of the Shanghai Branch of the China News Association, delivered a speech, followed by responses from Mr. Matudaira and Mr. Katsuno. Subsequently, Information Minister An delivered a speech. Finally, movie stars Bai Guang, Li Qingyun, and Wu Jinghong sang, creating a very harmonious atmosphere. The guests and hosts dispersed happily around 7:00 PM.

### Chairman's Speech

Chen Binhe, representing the five groups, delivered a welcome and farewell speech: "There are two meanings to holding this tea party today: First, to express our gratitude and bid farewell to Minister Matudaira of the former Embassy for his extensive cooperation over the past year and a half. Second, to welcome Secretary Katsuno, the successor to Secretary Matudaira of the newly organized Public Relations Department. Secretary Katsuno originally served in the Information Department of the Nanjing Embassy and has always had an indirect relationship with us, helping us a lot. Now that he has come to Shanghai, he will surely provide us with more guidance and more cooperation. Recently, the three reporting agencies of the Allied embassies in the area were reorganized into the Public Relations Department, unifying the reporting work. This is something we greatly admire. Information Counselor An of the Nanjing Embassy, who is present today, will assume a major guiding role in the Shanghai Public Relations Department, and we also welcome him. As the situation becomes increasingly tense day by day, our propaganda organizations should also tend towards concentrating their efforts, reducing waste, and seeking to cooperate with the authorities in unifying the war effort."

### Matudaira's Speech

Secretary Matudaira expressed his gratitude: "I am deeply grateful for the farewell from the five propaganda groups today. I arrived in Shanghai in February of this year and have spent a year and a half here. During this time, I have had a very close relationship with everyone present. However, I have not achieved anything significant during my tenure, and I feel deeply guilty. I sincerely hope to promote friendship and mutual understanding between China and Japan. We must base this on solid diplomatic relations and increase our friendly interactions. At this time of intense conflict, the ties between our two countries should be maintained more closely. I sincerely hope that everyone will continue to provide much guidance in both public and private matters, and at the same time, please also provide the same assistance to Secretary Katsuno."

### Katsuno's Thank You Speech

Secretary Katsuno thanked everyone: "Minister Matudaira has achieved much during his tenure and has been honorably transferred to serve in Peiping. I have been ordered to succeed him, and I am deeply afraid that I will not be able to fulfill the task. This time, the three reporting agencies of the Japanese Army, Navy, and Air Force in Shanghai have been merged into one, aiming not for superficial work but for practical development. I will always strive to implement this in order to achieve this goal, and at the same time, I hope that everyone will not hesitate to cooperate and provide guidance. I am deeply grateful for the grand reception today."

### Mr. An's Speech

Counselor An said: "There is a Japanese saying: 'Silence is better than many words,' but Chairman Chen Binhe mentioned me in his speech about the establishment of the Shanghai Public Relations Department this time, so I have no choice but to make a simple reply. My participation in the work of the Public Relations Department is of little importance. Since taking office in Nanjing two years ago, I have received close cooperation from all relevant parties in Nanjing. Now that I am serving in both Nanjing and Shanghai, I can only take care of both and work together. Please provide guidance and assistance to me from all parties in both Nanjing and Shanghai so that I can complete my task."

Commentary

### On Air Raid Relief and Rescue Work

— Chen Binhe

Recently, enemy aircraft have not ravaged our city for several days. Rumor has it that there is a hurricane in the Pacific Ocean, which has hindered them. This is by no means the oversensitive speculation of the general public in the city. Enemy aircraft will definitely not relax their grip on the people of Shanghai. We cannot ignore our vigilance because enemy aircraft are temporarily hindered by the weather. Therefore, I would like to offer some opinions on air raid relief and rescue work in our city:

The Civil Defense Headquarters of this city is the implementing agency responsible for air defense, rescue, and relief on the part of the municipal government (of course, this is only part of the work of the Civil Defense Headquarters; other work is not within the scope of this article, so it will not be discussed). The Air Raid Relief Committee of the Civil Welfare Association is the civil society rescue and relief organization. The Civil Defense Headquarters has been established for a long time and has detailed plans and considerable preparations for air defense, rescue, and relief work, but it has not yet reached the most ideal state and needs the assistance of civil society. Recently, after our city has repeatedly encountered air raids, civil society has spontaneously initiated the organization of rescue and relief groups, and all sectors have enthusiastically donated money. This is a very gratifying move.

On Tuesday of this week, following the liaison meeting between the Air Raid Relief Committee of the Civil Welfare Association and the relevant authorities of the municipal government on July 18, I exchanged views with Deputy Secretary-General Hu of the municipal government and Chief of General Affairs Noguchi of the Civil Defense Headquarters on fixed-attack rescue and relief work. The goal of both the government and civil society is to achieve greater efficiency in rescue and relief work during air raids. Our conclusion is that rescue and relief work must be closely linked between the government and civil society in order to achieve effective coordination. First, those who are enthusiastic about promoting rescue and relief work must first recognize that the Civil Defense Headquarters is the implementing agency that issues orders, and the Air Raid Relief Committee of the Civil Welfare Association is the agency that centralizes the rescue and relief efforts of civil society, adjusts the organization of civil society groups, and works under the command of the Civil Defense Headquarters. Because the Civil Defense Headquarters has the fastest information during air raids and has very close ties with the local military and police, it must issue orders. Because the Civil Welfare Association was originally an organization for the welfare of citizens, it must be responsible for centralizing and adjusting the strength and organization of civil society.

Second, we must further recognize that the current period is the most difficult in terms of materials, and no waste is allowed. Even an inch of gauze or a piece of cotton cannot be wasted. After the government and civil society organizations have close ties, we can obey the official command, concentrate the strength of civil society, and achieve no waste, and achieve twice the result with half the effort. Having enthusiasm is not enough. We must obey the command, especially during air raids. The centralization and adjustment work of the Civil Welfare Association is not control or management, but linking the strength of the government and civil society. Recently, in order to promote the liaison work between the government and civil society, Director Wen of the Civil Welfare Association has designated Mr. Gu Nanqun to be responsible for the liaison work with the Civil Defense Headquarters in the medical and pharmaceutical group, and Mr. Chen Riben to be responsible for the liaison work in the relief group. Therefore, other organizations in civil society should establish contact with the medical and pharmaceutical group and the relief group of the Civil Welfare Association, respectively.

We must repeat:

The Civil Defense Headquarters sincerely welcomes the spontaneous relief and rescue work of civil society.

The difficulties of manpower and material resources during wartime do not allow waste, and the work does not allow duplication. It must be promoted in an organized and planned manner, especially air raid relief and rescue work.

In order to achieve the second item, we must first centralize and adjust the strength of civil society, and then be able to cooperate with the Civil Defense Headquarters.

The enemy's attacks and expansion of devastation are very likely. We must never have a moment of relaxation, and we must take strict precautions anytime and anywhere so as to reduce the damage.

### Potsdam Conference Concludes, Three Countries to Issue Statement, Rumors that US President Plans to Meet with the King of England

Lisbon, 2nd (Central News Agency) – According to a dispatch from Potsdam, the three-party talks concluded on the afternoon of the 1st. The statement of the results of the talks will be issued simultaneously in the three capitals of Washington, London, and Moscow. US President Truman had originally planned to return home by plane after the talks, but there are rumors that he will meet with King George VI of England on the British battleship Renown in Plymouth Harbour. British Prime Minister Attlee and Foreign Minister Bevin are also scheduled to return to London on the 2nd.

Stockholm, 2nd (Central News Agency) – According to a report by Reuters diplomatic correspondent Kish, at present, all circles in London are extremely gratified that the Potsdam Conference, which was interrupted last Wednesday because Churchill and Attlee were anxious to return home, could still be held successfully. However, according to general observations in diplomatic circles, the entire Potsdam Conference has fallen into a stalemate, because the current differences among the three countries are irreconcilable, namely: 1. The administrative issues of the future Germany. 2. The future administrative issues of the Polish border region upstream of the Oder and Neisse rivers. 3. The issues of war booty and reparations, namely the current Soviet insistence that the war booty obtained by the Soviet army in all liberated areas cannot be regarded as German reparations and cannot reduce the amount of reparations due to the acquisition of war booty. 4. The issue of the Dardanelles Strait. The Soviet Union proposed to immediately revise the Montreux Convention. 5. The issue of the Suez Canal. The Soviet Union wanted to renegotiate a bilateral treaty of friendship with Turkey, according to which the Turkish government should provide the Soviet Union with a portion of the military bases within the territory of Turkey for application. The United States believes that this issue is a matter between the Soviet Union and Turkey and that other countries do not need to interfere. The issues that have been successfully resolved in the three-party talks are: 1. Recognition of the Renner government in Vienna. 2. The transfer of Germans from the Sudetenland to their home country.

Central News Agency dispatch – According to a New China News Agency report on the 29th, the Chongqing army, in order to attack the Yan'an area of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia border region, has transferred the Temporarily Organized 50th Division from various aspects of Jingning and Longde in western Gansu Province to reinforce the area. On the 27th, they arrived at the front line 60 kilometers north of Xi'an, attempting to launch a full-scale attack. The Yan'an army under He Long is actively strengthening its various defenses to resist the Chongqing army.

Central News Agency dispatch – According to a dispatch from the Yan'an New China News Agency, the Chongqing and Yan'an armies in central Shaanxi Province are still continuing their armed conflicts. As of the 27th, the Yan'an army defending Yetai Mountain, due to the fierce attack by the Chongqing army's Temporarily Organized 59th Division and Reserve 3rd Division, had abandoned the area and retreated to the rear. Since the 24th, the Chongqing army has used field artillery, mortars, and American-made rocket launchers to attack, and the Yan'an army finally could not resist and retreated.

### America's Shipbuilding Plan

Tokyo, 2nd (Central News Agency) – On March 19, 1940, Roosevelt signed the Two-Ocean Navy Act. Five years have passed. Recently, the US Navy and powerful figures boasted of possessing 1,565 ships, sufficient to establish a fleet. The initial decision was to increase the existing strength by 70%, which aroused opposition. Subsequently, the decision was made to increase it by another 70%, known as the Stark Plan. This plan allocated 4 billion US dollars to increase the naval strength from 1.7 million tons to 2.95 million tons within seven years, constructing 280,000 tons of battleships, 120,000 tons of aircraft carriers, 420,000 tons of cruisers, 250,000 tons of destroyers, 70,000 tons of submarines, and 100,000 tons of auxiliary merchant ships. However, according to the Navy Department's recent announcement, the number of warships added to the existing fleet in the past five years totals 1,322, an unprecedented figure in history, with most participating in the Pacific War. Regarding shipbuilding in the past five years, 331 ships were built in naval shipyards, and 991 were built in private shipyards. The former includes 7 battleships, 51 aircraft carriers, 58 destroyers, and 97 submarines. The latter includes 13 aircraft carriers, 105 escort carriers, 44 cruisers, 312 destroyers, and 112 submarines. Furthermore, it is planned to complete 2 battleships, 3 aircraft carriers of 45,000 tons, 9 of 21,700 tons, 2 of 14,500 tons, and 26 escort carriers this year. Generally, the US naval expansion plan began with the Vinson Act in 1934, which authorized the construction of 102 ships, and after overcoming the initial chaos in implementing the Washington and London Treaty shipbuilding limits, the expansion speed has been very significant.

### Central Reserve Bank to Launch Application for Cash Remittances for Evacuees Returning Home; Measures Announced and to Be Implemented Starting Next Week

According to reliable sources, the Central Reserve Bank authorities have noted the increasing number of evacuees returning to their hometowns. Everyone needs cash for travel expenses, transportation, and all expenses upon arrival. However, the practice of discounting currency has not ceased. Therefore, the Central Reserve Bank, in addition to liberally releasing remittance quotas and fully supplying banks and businesses with cash, has decided to launch applications for cash and remittances for evacuees returning home at its South and West District offices starting next week. After the implementation of these measures, they will not only reduce unnecessary losses for returning residents but also eliminate much of the illegal discounting of currency. The application procedures are as follows:

### Application Procedures

Any Shanghai citizen holding a Shanghai household registration certificate who is genuinely returning to their hometown due to evacuation may apply for cash or remittances in accordance with the provisions of these measures.

The maximum amount of cash that an evacuee returning home may apply for is 1 million yuan per person, and the maximum amount of remittance is 2 million yuan per person. The application is limited to one time only. If the amount applied for is less than the prescribed amount, no additional applications will be allowed in the future.

Evacuees returning home who apply for cash or remittances must provide a guarantor to ensure that they are genuinely returning home due to evacuation and that there is no deception. They must also have one of the following documents: 1. Population movement certificate from the baojia (neighborhood self-governance system). 2. Proof documents from the evacuation agency, certified by the police station's baojia section. 3. A special guarantee from a bank, after verification.

Evacuees returning home who apply for cash must first deposit the instrument with the bank, which will issue a receipt. The applicant's household registration certificate number, name, occupation, address, and other important information must be filled out in detail for investigation. The cash may be collected from the bank three days later upon presentation of the receipt. The application procedure for remittances is the same and should be handled simultaneously.

Evacuees returning home who apply for remittances, in addition to following the procedures in the previous article, may remit to any branch of the bank free of charge. However, remittances must be made by draft and not by telegraphic transfer.

If it is discovered that an evacuee returning home who applies for cash or remittances has falsified evidence, engaged in deception, or used it for arbitrage, the guarantor will be held strictly accountable, and the matter will be handed over to the police for legal action.

These measures shall take effect from the date of promulgation.

### Chairman Zhou and Director Chen Emphasize Reform of Control Agencies and Request Smooth Exchange of Materials

Minister of Industry Chen Junhui stated that the control of materials for national and civilian needs is an extremely important task. In particular, the adjustment and strengthening of control agencies cannot be ignored. Last week, he came to Shanghai from Nanjing and frequently contacted Chairman Zhou of the Materials Control Review Committee and relevant parties, and constantly listened to reports from Wen Lanting, Director-General of the Shanghai Business Control Committee, and the chairmen of various control committees, and gave instructions. According to inquiries from relevant parties, Chairman Zhou and Director Chen attach great importance to the preparations for the reform and development of the three control committees for rice, oil, and wheat flour. They are actively seeking to reform the materials control agencies and smooth the exchange of materials in the future.

### Police Department Announces Personnel Changes

The Municipal Police Department has made further personnel changes to the chiefs of branch bureaus and section chiefs. Shen Zhihai, chief of the Putuo Road Branch Bureau, has been transferred to be the chief inspector of the Third Inspection District of the Inspection Department. Xu Shunqing, the original chief inspector of the Third Inspection District, has been transferred to be a specialist in the Second Department.

### Appeal of Police Officer Conviction Case Opens Yesterday

Xu Shucheng, the former chief of the Putuo Road Branch Bureau of the Municipal Police Department, and Bao Tianyi, the director of the Administrative Section (currently the chief of the Administrative Section's Zhengsu Section), were sued by Cai Bulou and Cai Buque to the Shanghai District Court for dereliction of duty, fraud, unlawful detention, abuse of prisoners, and assault for being ordered to crack down on illegal ferries during their tenure. After eight months of delay, the final judgment found them not guilty of dereliction of duty, fraud, unlawful detention, and abuse of prisoners, but sentenced Xu and Bao to six months' imprisonment for assault. The countersuit of Xu and Bao against Guo and Cai was also found not guilty. Xu and Bao, dissatisfied with the original judgment, filed an appeal with the Shanghai Higher District Court with the approval of their superiors and opposed the charges of malicious prosecution by Cai and others. The Higher Court accepted the case and opened the trial in the Second Criminal Chamber of the Court of Appeal at 11 a.m. yesterday, presided over by Director Xuan as the presiding judge. After interrogating the appellants and appellees, Presiding Judge Xuan stated that the court was prepared to determine the scope of the appeal and adjourned the hearing to a later date.

### Old Zhabei Branch Bureau Cracks Down on Another Counterfeit Promissory Note Operation; Tens of Millions of Yuan Used in Circulation

The Municipal Police Department has repeatedly cracked down on and brought to justice counterfeit promissory note operations. The Old Zhabei Branch Bureau recently cracked down on another counterfeit promissory note operation. Details are as follows:

A group of ruffians, including Wu Qixin, Yu Shangqing, Yu Runbiao, Sang Xueming, and a woman named Zhang Yuejuan, engaged in illegitimate activities and recently counterfeited "Shanghai Hangzhou Tea Leaf Bank" promissory notes. These notes were widely used in the Old Zhabei, New Cheng, and Taishan districts, especially in the Zhonghua Road area of Nanshi. Several small shops run by small-scale merchants have been defrauded of large sums of money and have gone out of business.

The day before yesterday, Wu Qixin and Zhang Yuejuan went to the Dahua Women's Shoe Store in the Small Garden on Zhejiang Road and attempted to use the counterfeit promissory notes. The store detected that the notes were fake and refused to accept them, leading to a conflict. Song Bingzheng, chief of the Third Section of the Old Zhabei Branch Bureau, and Police Constable Murai and others happened to be passing by and stepped forward to inquire about the situation. At this time, a clerk from the Xiangcheng Department Store on Guangxi Road recognized Wu and Zhang because they had also used fake promissory notes at the store a few days earlier. The clerk apprehended Wu and Zhang and took them to the bureau for interrogation. Based on the confessions of Wu and the others, the counterfeit promissory note operation was located at No. 2, Lane 113, Changsheng Street, Dajing Road, Nanshi. The other suspects, Yu Shangqing, Yu Runbiao, and Sang Xueming, were also arrested. A stack of counterfeit promissory notes and seals were confiscated. According to their confessions, they had circulated counterfeit promissory notes worth tens of millions of yuan. The bureau hopes that any merchants who have been deceived and have received "Shanghai Hangzhou Tea Leaf Bank" counterfeit promissory notes will report to the Third Section of the bureau so that the case can be closed.

### Old Brand Lin Wen Perfume

— Cen Jia

The rumbling, grating sound had disappeared for quite some time. It looked like it probably wouldn’t be back, so the clerks squatting at the bottom of the stairs plucked up their courage and crawled out. Old Wang, who had been squatting in the rearmost place, also began to remember, in the aftermath of his shock, that a bottle of something in the shop had been smashed on the floor by the huge tremor just now. Wanting to see what exactly had happened, he followed the others out, walking quickly towards the shop.

The strong sunlight streaming into the shop illuminated the ash and lime dust on everyone's faces and clothes. Some people even had a bit of grime on their faces.

"Ah, look at you!" one clerk said, patting the dust off his clothes while mocking the skinny man across from him, whose face was covered in patches of black and white.

"You should look at yourself first. You're covered from head to toe in white dust!"

"Sigh, getting hit with a little bit of lime is still lucky," the oldest clerk said with a sigh.

"Even mud and lime were shaken down; that means one must have landed very close."

"Once the all-clear is sounded, we should go take a look to see exactly where."

The clerks were chattering away, going off on tangents, when suddenly they all heard a "snap!" sound, and they couldn't help but be startled. However, most of them were able to barely maintain their composure and try to figure out where the sound came from. The skinny man, however, didn't even dare to look and ran straight inside.

"Feeding you seventy or eighty thousand for a *dan* of rice is like throwing it to the dogs!"

It was the boss's voice. As he spoke, he waved his hand and walked towards the only apprentice in the shop. The apprentice thought the boss was going to slap him again, so he tightly protected his face with both hands. However, the boss immediately changed his tactic, raising his thin, bony leg and kicking the apprentice hard in the buttocks. The apprentice, not expecting this, lost his balance and fell to the ground.

The ground where the apprentice fell was covered in broken glass shards, so as soon as he landed, blood immediately started flowing from his hands. As for his head, he was at least holding it up, so he didn't hit the glass shards and start bleeding.

"Useless fool, can't even stand up straight!"

The apprentice endured the pain and struggled to his feet, his eyes filled with tears, which he was trying hard not to let out.

At the same time, many people noticed that bright red blood was seeping from the trousers around his knees.

"Do you know, you little devil, how much a bottle of Old Brand Lin Wen Perfume is worth now?"

Old Wang was agonizingly using his foot to play with the neck of the broken perfume bottle. The perfume spilled on the ground sparkled in the sunlight, and a rich fragrance rushed straight into his nose.

"Look how strong the scent is. Someone offered me 20,000 in cash the other day, and I didn't sell it. Now that it's broken, it's not worth a single penny."

Old Wang bent down, wishing he could use his tongue to lick up the spilled perfume.

While the boss was wholly absorbed in lamenting the perfume, the old clerk quietly pulled the apprentice inside. Traces of blood were left where the apprentice had walked.

If the prolonged all-clear siren hadn't awakened Old Wang, he probably would have remained there, reminiscing over the broken perfume.

Finally, he straightened up. He noticed that the apprentice was no longer in the shop. He didn't bother asking where he had hidden himself, but instead sharply said to the remaining clerks:

"What are you standing around doing? Aren't you going to tidy up the things in the glass cabinet? Put all the valuables away for me. You've already ruined a bottle of Old Brand perfume! Miserable individualists!"

### Stars

— Xiao Xiao

Late at night, still not feeling sleepy, I casually leaned against the window to look at the stars. At this time, the room was dark, and the outside was also shrouded in darkness. Only the stars in the distant sky were twinkling with their faint light. I love them, they make me linger, forget my weariness, and feel uplifted... The only glimmer of light in the darkness is precisely what illuminates my path ahead. Although it is tiny, it is bright.

Touching the thickening hair on my temples, I feel that I still have a real life, but I dare not think further... Family, life, wife and children, rice, firewood... Familiar, sporadic memories, like neon lights, repeatedly appear on the screen of my mind, circling and circling, disturbing my entire brain until it aches faintly.

"Ah... Ah, ah..." I even wanted to cry out, like a trapped beast roaring. I stared intently at the stars in the distant sky. Other than that, the room and the outside were pitch black, accompanied by utter loneliness.

However, the stars in the distant sky flickered uncertainly, and I felt again: "How tiny, how weak!" What it bestows upon me is also so tiny and weak. But, after all, it is bright! From its flashing, twinkling glow, continuing, continuing, it finally fills the dark sky—it is a bridge from darkness to dawn. This weakness is temporary, this darkness is also temporary!

Then I received an inspiration. I was excited, gazing remotely, looking into the distance, towards the stars. Although it was only those faint and tiny lights, what they gave me was incomparable warmth and enlightenment.

### Two Poems

— Zhou Yuanqing

A Lament

To speak of life's bitter wine, the tears of a staggering drunkard!  In vain did I bear the lessons and earnest teachings;  I must linger and lean upon the pavilion, thinking,  Lest the threads of thought be like wandering silk,  While the stars nightly illuminate the prodigal.

Feelings

Listen to a melody -- the world's fickle warmth, tears strike at the heart, voices filled with sorrow! Compel me to pass again by bustling markets; buying wine in the streets -- sorrow upon sorrow!

### Review of "Gu Yin"

— Shi Qing

The recently published comprehensive magazine "Gu Yin" can be considered a large publication, substantial in content, with fifteen articles, presented in a grand and uninhibited manner.

"A New Theory of Balzac" and "Folk Songs of the Six Dynasties" have their unique insights and meticulous textual research. The three translated novels, "Advanced Course" (Chekhov), "A Moment of Misjudgment" (Balzac), and "The Sacrifice of a Bookworm" (Gissing), should all be considered outstanding works. In particular, "The Sacrifice of a Bookworm," the author uses realistic techniques to depict the darker side of petty bourgeois life, writing about social corruption and the plight of the unfortunate.

In terms of essays, Guo Peng's "Old Residence" is an excellent piece of writing. The reader can feel that faint atmosphere of sorrow and loneliness.

In today's publishing drought, it is a welcome thing to see this magazine appear in the barren literary scene. We hope that its life can be a little longer. In other words, the second and third issues can continue to be published, bringing readers some new things, some necessary things. At least, for the moment, we hope to see a good publication.
