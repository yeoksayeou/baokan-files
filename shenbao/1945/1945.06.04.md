### Decisive Battles on All Fronts in Southern Okinawa Island: The War Situation Nears a Critical Juncture; The Japanese Army Has Reaped Astonishing War Gains in the Past Two Months

Tokyo, 3rd (Central News Agency) – The ground battles in the southern Okinawa region have reached a fever pitch. Both sides are pouring in their main forces, and a major decisive battle is unfolding across the entire front. On the 31st, the enemy invaded Naha City and the Shuri Castle ruins, which are major Japanese army strongholds. Furthermore, a portion of the enemy army continued south from the vicinity of Yonabaru, reaching Inafuku (approximately 30 kilometers south of Yonabaru), where fierce battles, a veritable mountain of corpses and river of blood, are being fought with the intercepting Japanese army. The enemy is currently pouring in the full force of approximately seven divisions on the front line, attempting to forcibly break through the central defense lines of the Japanese army. The war situation in Okinawa is approaching a critical juncture.

Tokyo, 3rd (Central News Agency) – Since landing on the main island of Okinawa on April 1st, the enemy army has been subjected to special attacks from the Japanese army in the air, on land, and at sea for more than two months. Suffering heavy casualties, they are still attempting to advance south on the main island, seeking to break through the Japanese army's strong defenses, but have been met with fierce counterattacks from the Japanese army. The enemy's personnel losses in the southern part of the main island alone have exceeded 50,000 men. Four out of the eight divisions of the enemy's total landing force have completely lost their ability to fight. In addition, the Japanese air force and special attack units have continuously launched fierce attacks on the enemy's fleet and the mobile task force entrenched in the seas to the east of Okinawa, sinking and destroying 566 enemy combat vessels, including aircraft carriers, battleships, and transport ships. Furthermore, enemy airfield facilities are bombed and set on fire daily. Faced with the relentless Japanese air attacks, the enemy, in an attempt to reverse the situation, has mobilized the British mobile task force and simultaneously deployed B-29 aircraft from the Mariana Islands base, conducting tactical bombing raids to support the carrier-based aircraft operations. For more than a month, they have launched direct attacks on Japanese air bases in the Kyushu region. On the other hand, they are attempting to crush the Japanese will to fight and disrupt production and transportation, intensifying strategic bombing, and indiscriminately bombing important cities such as Tokyo, Yokohama, Osaka, and Kobe. As such, the battle for the defense of Okinawa Island is becoming increasingly fierce, and has now reached its peak. The Japanese side has achieved astonishing war gains, but the enemy, still relying on materiel, disregards serious losses and sacrifices and fights the Japanese army to the bitter end. Now the Okinawa war situation is gradually becoming critical.

### Weekly War Situation in Various Parts of East Asia

Tokyo, 3rd (Central News Agency) – The war situation in various parts of East Asia during the past week is as follows:

Okinawa Area: Fierce battles continue in the southern part of Okinawa Island. The focus of the attack is on the east coast, where the enemy army is attempting to strike directly at the flanks and rear of the Japanese army, gradually invading the area south of Yonabaru. A decisive battle is unfolding between the two armies at Japanese army positions between Shuri and Yonabaru, such as Kōchi and Naha City. The Japanese air force is coordinating its efforts, constantly attacking enemy ships around the main island, inflicting considerable damage. The enemy mobile task force has escaped the sharp edge of the Japanese special attack units in the Ryukyu waters and is attempting to reorganize its formation. The enemy ground forces have also suffered heavy losses and are currently working to consolidate their bases. Enemy aircraft attacking the Ryukyu Islands numbered about 30 on the 27th, about 90 on the 29th, about 80 on the 30th, and about 200 on June 1st. On the 28th, about 50 enemy aircraft attacked the southern Kyushu region.

Mariana and Ogasawara Areas: As the Okinawa war situation becomes increasingly tense, the enemy air force from the Mariana Islands base, seeking to weaken the strength of Japanese special attack bases, has frequently conducted tactical bombing raids on the Kyushu region. After a month, starting last week, they have changed their strategy again, continuously conducting bombing raids on various cities, attempting to depress the Japanese people's will to fight, and spreading leaflets, disrupting public order, and destroying factories, hindering production, etc., thus transitioning to strategic bombing. The enemy army seems to be quite active in its actions, aiming to shorten the duration of the war against Japan and reduce its burden, and will definitely advance its policies in this direction in the future.

Philippine Islands Area: The enemy army in the Luzon area is working hard to strengthen its air fortresses and has achieved considerable success. The enemy army that has invaded Baguio City and its vicinity belongs to the 33rd Division and seems to be preparing an offensive posture, but its actions are not very active. The Japanese army units defending the northern and eastern mountainous areas continue to carry out close-quarters combat attacks, inflicting heavy casualties on the enemy. Fierce battles continue at the northern positions of Balete and Salacsac Pass. The enemy forces in that area are the 25th, 32nd, and 37th Divisions, in addition to the 16th Tank Division standing by. Furthermore, in mid-May, the deputy commander of the enemy's 25th Division was killed in action in the Balete area. Around May 19th, a portion of the enemy's 43rd Division attacked the Ipo Dam area, the water source for Manila, to the east of Manila. Also, the 1st Cavalry Division, passing through the area north of Laguna de Bay, reached Lamon Bay on the 17th. The Japanese army in that area is holding the mountainous areas, engaging in fierce battles with great courage. The enemy's 3rd Division, which landed on the southern coast of Mindanao Island, and the 40th Division, which landed on the northern coast, met near Malaybalay, attempting to advance east. However, the Japanese army units to the east of that area immediately engaged them, inflicting heavy casualties. On the other hand, the Japanese army is luring the enemy, which has invaded the periphery of Davao and the right bank of the Davao River, into the depths of Japanese army positions, and is continuing to engage in a fierce and bloody battle. Furthermore, since mid-May, the Japanese army units in the right bank area have repeatedly repelled the enemy army's repeated attacks, killing more than 6,000 enemy soldiers by May 26th.

Burma Area: The British 36th Division invaded the area near Kyaukse, east of Meiktila. However, the Japanese army units in that area immediately engaged them, stopping their advance. The enemy's 19th Division, which attempted to invade the area from Toungoo, via the Sittang River, to Kado and Mawlaik, was also stopped by the Japanese army, and fierce battles are unfolding. The Japanese army has repeatedly repelled the enemy army attempting to cross the river and advance east near the mouth of the Sittang River. Looking at the Burma war situation, which is about to enter the rainy season, it is entering a state of normalization in the area east of the Sittang River.

Southwest Pacific Area: The enemy army in the Tarakan area is attacking the Japanese army's strong first-line positions, engaging in fierce battles. The enemy army has deployed armored units, attempting to break through or conduct flanking maneuvers. The Japanese army is conducting large-scale night attacks against them, repeatedly wiping out enemy forces. The war situation is in a stalemate, with no major changes to note.

Palau Area: From around mid-April to late April, the Japanese army and navy units in the Palau area conducted sweeping operations in the waters between Palau and Babeldaob Island. During the two weeks, they killed approximately 1,000 enemy soldiers, sank several ships, and recaptured several islands, showing that the Japanese army units in that area are still in good shape.

### Shortage of American Ships

Zurich, 2nd (Central News Agency) – According to a Washington dispatch from the Exchange Telegraph, Major General Kearney of the U.S. Army recently stated regarding the shipping problem after the end of the European war: After the end of the European war, the ships previously in Europe will not be released. On the contrary, the shipping problem will encounter new difficulties. For example, the United States must transport 90,000 tons of gasoline to the Pacific area every day, but this gasoline accounts for only a portion of the vast amount of war materials. Moreover, as the war nears the Japanese mainland, a large number of ships will be needed for transporting personnel alone.

### Soviet Technical Experts

Guangzhou, 3rd (Central News Agency) – According to news arriving here: A group of 25 Soviet technical experts has arrived in Yan'an. Their purpose is to engage in technical training for the Yan'an army and the organization of agriculture and industry in Shaanxi Province. Among those dispatched are technical advisors to the Yan'an government, in order to strengthen the military and economic work of the Yan'an government.

### Zhejiang Province Plans to Organize a People's Advisory Council to Be Responsible for Assisting the Government in Implementing Policies

Hangzhou, 3rd (Central News Agency) – Since Governor Ding of this province took office, he has adjusted the organizational structure of various departments in order to give play to the effectiveness of wartime work. In order to promote the unity of the government and the people, to convey the situation above to those below and conform to the policies, and to meet the urgent needs of the current environment, it is planned to establish a People's Advisory Council. Its nature is different from that of ordinary public opinion organs. Because ordinary public opinion organs are opposed to the government, but the Advisory Council is essentially one with the government, responsible for assisting and guiding the government in implementing policies. The members of the council are selected by various gentry and strata in this province. The drafted organizational regulations, etc., have been submitted to the Executive Yuan of the National Government for review and approval. Once approved, they can be implemented. It is predicted that the implementation of policies in Zhejiang Province in the future will be as clear as pointing at one's palm, and the Advisory Council's contributions to the authorities will not be insignificant.

Flax and Ramie Production Increase Plan

Hangzhou, 3rd (Central News Agency) – The Zhejiang Provincial Agricultural Promotion Association believes that textiles are necessary for industry and are one of the military supplies. In addition to designating flax and ramie growing areas for mass production, the association is also increasing the designated planting area in various places. The subsidy is set at 300 yuan per mu. The total subsidy amount for this province will be determined and applied to the central government for approval after the area is determined. The goal is to make flax and ramie production benefit farmers and meet the needs of society.

Hangzhou, 3rd (Central News Agency) – Wheat is a winter crop and also one of the main food crops, as important as rice cultivation. For wheat planting, fertilizer selection, weeding, and the implementation of new planting methods, the Zhejiang Provincial Agricultural Promotion Association will have the Agricultural Promotion Association and trained backbone farmers provide on-site guidance. The guidance incentive fee will be determined after the provinces and cities plan a unified fleet.

### Wuhu Youth Center Commemorates Opium Suppression Day

Wuhu, 3rd (Central News Agency) – Today is the June 3rd Opium Suppression Day. In addition to holding a commemorative ceremony at 9:00 AM, the Youth Center of this county also issued a "Letter to the Youth," hoping to awaken the public's understanding of the significance of opium suppression and to cooperate with the government in completing the policy of rejecting drugs.

### Three Giants Conference to Be Held This Month

Lisbon, 3rd (Central News Agency) – According to Washington news: President Truman stated today that the Three Giants Conference will be held in the near future. He did not disclose the location of the meeting but stated that it would not necessarily be held in the United States. President Truman will closely contact Prime Minister Churchill beforehand to make preparations before the meeting.

Another dispatch: According to well-informed sources in San Francisco: The first meeting of President Truman, Churchill, and Stalin will be held around mid-June. If the San Francisco Conference is postponed until after mid-August, President Truman may not be able to attend the final conference to deliver a speech as planned. The Three Giants Conference will not be affected by the postponement of the San Francisco Conference.

### Army Commander-in-Chief Sugiyama Presents Citation to Kobayashi Air Group; Japanese Army Ministry Announced Yesterday

Tokyo, 3rd (Central News Agency) – The Japanese Kobayashi Fighter Group, responsible for the homeland air defense, fought bravely and fiercely. In six months, it shot down and destroyed 178 enemy aircraft, completing the great task of defending the homeland.

Editorial

### Near East War and Three Giants Conference

The armed conflicts in the Near Eastern countries of Syria and Lebanon by France have made British Foreign Secretary Eden publicly declare the situation "extremely serious." The Soviet People's Commissariat for Foreign Affairs also made an emergency suggestion to the British, American, and French envoys, believing that the armed conflicts between Syria and Lebanon and the French army violated the spirit and principles decided by the Dumbarton Oaks Conference and violated the purpose of the San Francisco United Nations Conference discussing the establishment of an organization to guarantee national peace and security. Obviously, the recent war in the Near East is not only a manifestation of the absurd policies of the French provisional government, but also the so-called United Nations.

Since the First World War, Syria and Lebanon have been under the military control of French imperialism and regarded as French colonies. However, due to the location of Syria and Lebanon, they have long been the objects of contention among European powers. First, this country (before World War II, Lebanon was part of Syria), although a historically ancient civilization, has always been economically and politically backward and corrupt. Coupled with ethnic and religious divisions, the interior is often not unified, causing the great powers to regard it as meat on the chopping board. Second, the country is rich in resources, especially in oil production and the transit of international oil pipelines, holding the main entrepot ports of the eastern Mediterranean, so it is coveted by the great powers. Third, in terms of strategic position, it is the thoroughfare of Eurasian transportation, and has always been a place of contention for British, French, German, and Russian military strategists. Under these conditions, these two countries have long had the name of the gunpowder keg of the Near East.

When World War II broke out, General de Gaulle launched the Syrian War with the support of the United Kingdom. As a result, General Dentz, dispatched by the Vichy government, surrendered, and Syria fell under the control of de Gaulle. At that time, de Gaulle, who was just starting out, in order to appease the people, under the banner of "Free France," allowed Syria and Lebanon to independently establish their own countries. The people of Syria and Lebanon and all ethnic groups in the Near East cheered and celebrated, making General de Gaulle's international reputation grow day by day. Unexpectedly, recently, after de Gaulle returned to Paris, restored France's false name as one of the world's "five powers," he once again revealed his face as a defender of the imperialist system, and his attitude towards Syria and Lebanon suddenly changed. He was unwilling to give up France's special rights in Syria and Lebanon, making the ethnic groups in Syria and Lebanon and the Near East restless.

The main reason for France's change of attitude towards Syria and Lebanon is that, in view of the discussion on the future international security guarantee mechanism in the San Francisco Conference, only the strong are still reasonable, the major powers occupy absolute power, and no sincere agreement has been reached between the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union on the issue of mandated territories and colonies. All of this stimulated the de Gaulle government, which妄想效法英美，霸佔及恢復其在世界的殖民地, and sought to emulate Britain and the United States, occupying and restoring its colonies in the world, starting with Syria and Lebanon, and then restoring France's colonial authority before World War II, that is, the so-called Near East-Indian Ocean-Far East French colonial sphere, and competing with the United Kingdom.

However, in order to protect its Eurasian strategic and economic communication lines, the United Kingdom will never allow France to monopolize Syria and Lebanon, which threaten the center of this communication line, the Suez Canal. Therefore, they also have various activities in Syria and Lebanon. At the same time, Syria and Lebanon, since the transformation of the European situation last year, in order to obtain strong foreign aid, have successively established diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union. As the Soviet Union's influence in Southeastern Europe has become widespread, it is happy to provide assistance to Syria and Lebanon, the gateway to the Mediterranean Sea in the Far East and the center of the Near Eastern countries. Under such complex international relations, the sudden incident of the French army on Syria and Lebanon certainly has the power to sensationalize international public opinion.

Now, because Churchill sent a letter of warning to de Gaulle, ordering a ceasefire and troop withdrawal, and ordered the British troops stationed in the Near East to take action as the opportunity arises, and the Soviet Union intervened, the chaos in Syria and Lebanon will probably calm down temporarily; however, the above-mentioned complex factors will only make the situation "more chaotic." In addition, there have recently been conflicts between British troops and Yugoslav troops over the Trieste port garrison issue, as well as Iran's request for the withdrawal of British, American, and Soviet troops. The complexity of the relationships is no less than that of the Syrian and Lebanese issues. Probably the Three Giants Conference cannot resolve it. Under the current situation, Truman is suffering from the increasingly serious social and domestic problems in the United States, and Churchill is facing the critical moment of the Labour Party's bloody battle. Then, even if the Three Giants Conference can be勉强召集 within a short period of time, it is not difficult to predict what the result will be.

### A Complete Look at Shenjiang County (Part 2)

— Yu Kun

More than half of the people own their own houses in the county. The number of those who are renting is relatively small. The rent was once calculated in rice, but now it has been converted into cash. In the prosperous areas, the monthly rent for an average two-story house is about 8,000 yuan, and for a bungalow, about 6,000 yuan. In residential areas, the monthly rent is about 4,000 yuan, but a single room costs 1,000 to 2,000 yuan. The people are generally able to support themselves, so the living conditions are still relatively good. However, prices have been rising continuously in recent years, and are affected by the Shanghai market. If people are not exceptionally thrifty and do not work hard to increase production, it will be difficult to maintain this leisurely lifestyle.

In terms of taxes, there are many items. In addition to the national taxes and city taxes that should be levied, there are also exorbitant taxes and miscellaneous levies, totaling no less than twenty kinds. There is a general feeling that people cannot bear the burden.

Except for rice, which is slightly cheaper, the prices of other goods are also gradually rising. Here are some examples of the prices of various commodities in the local area on the 23rd of this month:

Rice: 150,000 yuan per dan (150 jin); pure oil: 1,500 yuan per jin; vegetable oil: 1,600 yuan per jin; cotton: over 50,000 yuan per dan; salt: 180 yuan per jin; soybeans: 600 yuan per jin; red beans: 700 yuan per jin; chicken eggs: 110 yuan each; meat: 1,300 yuan per jin; tofu: at least 50 yuan; "Tongben" soap: 700 yuan per piece; matches: 120 yuan per box; candles: 700 yuan per stick; large cakes and deep-fried dough sticks: 100 yuan per piece; boiled water: 100 yuan per scoop; raw water (river water): 70 to 100 yuan per dan; bean stalk firewood: 5,000 yuan per dan; rice straw: 3,500 yuan per dan.

Looking at the various prices listed above, except for daily necessities, the rest are cheaper than in Shanghai. In the past, the county's commerce was the best in the country. After several divisions, the prosperous cities and towns were all placed under the jurisdiction of Shanghai. The remaining areas have very quiet commerce. Only Minhang Town is relatively better, followed by Zhuanqiao Town and Maqiao Town. The rest are not worth mentioning. All commercial market conditions are shifted by Shanghai merchants. In the future, with convenient transportation and rapid transport, we can hope for the revitalization of commerce. The county has traditionally been an agricultural area, but in recent years it has become increasingly industrialized. Chimneys stand tall, and factories are everywhere. The most famous products are bricks, tiles, silk fabrics, and yarn, which have low production costs and are well-made, so they sell well throughout the country. After the incident (likely referring to a military or political event), a considerable number of factories have been closed for various reasons. Now only a few small factories remain, and their products primarily are cotton.

As for the financial situation, everything is shifted by Shanghai. Except for two banks and one trust company in Minhang, there are no large-scale financial institutions elsewhere. The Shenjiang Cooperative Branch in Minhang Town has about 16,000 members, but the total funds in the branch are less than one million yuan. Due to improper management, it has suffered losses and is almost exhausted. Recently, the branch decided to increase capital, changing from 60 yuan per household to 1,000 yuan. Regarding agricultural loans, the cooperative has partnered with the Bank of Communications. Initially, the loan was 5,000 yuan per person, but later increased to 20,000 yuan per household. The total loan amount is about 5 million yuan, with a monthly interest rate of only 3%. The drawback is that the time it takes from application to direct lending to farmers is often delayed by several months, which leads to a loss of effectiveness. This fails to meet the urgent needs of farmers. It is hoped that the authorities will improve this situation. The loans are mostly used to purchase fertilizers, seeds, and farm implements.

The main occupation of the county's residents is agriculture, followed by commerce and industry. The number of unemployed vagrants is very small. The most famous relief organization is the Pu'an Hall in Minhang, followed by the Minhang Relief Bureau. Recently, due to a lack of funds, the facilities are crude and simple, so it is difficult for the poor to receive real benefits.

In the county's towns and villages, the streets are narrow and full of dirt. Recognizing this, the city's chamber of commerce and the authorities specifically raised funds in Minhang Town to build public toilets, street lights, and cleaning services. The operating expenses are covered by the sale of excrement from the public toilets to farmers to manage local public health, and the results are excellent. Recently, the municipal government believes that this matter should be under the jurisdiction of the Health Bureau, and specifically appointed the local "Maosheng Cleaning Station" to handle it. Since taking over, it has only sold excrement and has greatly neglected public health, so the appearance of the city is not as good as before. There is a private hospital in Minhang Town with complete facilities, and it is the only Western one. The other towns only have some private

There are only three middle schools and dozens of elementary schools in the county. The county provides a monthly subsidy of 30,440 yuan, any remaining expenses are the city Chamber of Commerce's responsibility to raise and supplement; private schools rely on tuition income, and contributions from the school board.

The tuition fee for a county middle school is 5,000 yuan per person, but it is still felt that they cannot afford it, and private schools are slightly higher. Because tuition fees are expensive, most villagers cannot send their children to school. Based on the current number of school-age children, only 20 to 30% attend school. As for the teachers' salaries, the best is at Cikang Middle School in Tangwan Town, where each teacher receives an average of about one dan of rice per month, which is far different from the county middle school, which pays 200 yuan per hour. Due to the salary differences, the quality of the teachers is also different. The teachers at Cikang Middle School all have at least a high school education, while others are lower. Some even have elementary school graduates working as elementary school teachers. As for the students' level, there is a vast difference between now and then.

When the reporter first arrived in the county, he interviewed the county magistrate, Li Guangyuan, and asked him to announce his recent administrative policies and explain the details. I will briefly record them below:

All administrative reforms are built on a solid foundation of security and economic stability. The county is located in a corner of Shanghai, and security is the top priority. With convenient transportation, economic relief will not be difficult to establish. However, the current situation in all areas is not perfect, so since taking over, I have planned to make reforms.

The county's economy is based on agricultural production. To stabilize people's lives, the only way is to revive the rural economy. The main task is to improve production techniques, so that all crops can be cultivated smoothly to achieve increased production. This measure will also benefit Shanghai's population dispersion efforts.

Improve transportation infrastructure and promote the circulation of goods. The Hu-Min Road is an important transportation artery between the city and the county seat. Since the incident, the road surface has been severely damaged. Recently, with the increasing importance of highway transportation, it is planned that after the busy farming season, the district and town chiefs will be responsible for hiring laborers to repair the road sections in their respective districts within a limited time.

Organize a political work propaganda team to make the general public understand the importance and content of political work and assist the government in moving towards the road to revival together.

Strengthen the Baojia system. Although each district and town has a Baojia organization, it is very rudimentary. In the future, it should be rectified and effectively guided, so that local security can be better ensured.

Prohibit smoking and gambling. Recently, the habit of smoking and gambling has become very prevalent in various villages, especially in Minhang. Although it is not public, it concerns local morality. Therefore, on the June 3rd Anti-Smoking Day, a clean-up campaign to ban smoking was held, including speeches and screenings of the film "Wan Shi Liu Fang" to publicize the harm of smoking, and actively try to suppress various smoking and gambling institutions and gathering places.

Improve the equipment and treatment of educational administration and other public agencies, in order to enhance local public welfare (The End)

### San Francisco Conference Discusses Military Enforcement Measures; Impasse Formed Over Insurance Procedures

Lisbon, 3rd (Central News Agency): San Francisco telegram: With the problems of veto power and the mandate system yet to be resolved, the United Nations Conference is now discussing the military enforcement measures proposed by the Security Council, which is led by five countries. At a meeting of the Implementation Measures Committee last night, an amendment was passed, deciding that France should also attend when Yu, the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union hold consultations, and stipulating that during the transition period before the special agreement on the forces of the Security Council comes into effect, joint action should be taken to maintain peace. Regarding the above-mentioned special agreement and its military agreement, some people suspect that only in a world war can the necessary approval of the five countries and the other half of the member states be obtained, so negotiations on the military agreement must actually be delayed until then.

Lisbon, 3rd (Central News Agency): According to a San Francisco telegram: The Soviet government's reply on the voting procedure issue of the Security Council did not reach the Soviet representative until the evening of the 1st. Representatives of the five countries, Britain, the United States, the Soviet Union, Yu, and France, held a meeting that night. The United States and Britain finally came into direct conflict with the Soviet Union's claims. The meeting ended without any conclusions. The five countries continued to discuss the matter at the meeting, but both sides held their own views and it was difficult to reach an agreement. The final result of the San Francisco Conference will fall into an intractable deadlock. Most small countries follow the claims of Britain and the United States, and needless to say, absolutely oppose the Soviet Union, so the Soviet Union has become isolated. Anxious about the end of the conference, Britain and the United States have repeatedly entrusted future agreements to the voting procedure of the Dumbarton Oaks Conference. However, representatives of small countries believe that voting is the most important provision in the International Organization Act. If this matter is not decided, the entire Organization Act will be meaningless, so they expressed strong opposition, and the United States and Britain are in a dilemma.

### Soviet Newspaper Exposes American Territorial Ambitions

Stockholm, Swedish Capital, 3rd (Central News Agency): As the world war situation continues to shift, the antagonism between the United States and the Soviet Union has reached a head. According to a Moscow broadcast on the 2nd, American ambitions for Pacific territories were exposed. According to a report from the San Francisco correspondent of the Soviet government's official newspaper "News": The theme of the American Pacific War seems to be like the "colonial heroism" of the British imperialist "Kipling." American citizens, from news magazines and leaflets aimed at soldiers to the statements of political leaders, consistently express such ideas, advocating that the United States must possess Pacific islands. American senators, admirals, or commentators also take the view that the Pacific problem cannot be resolved without this. The United States dreams of winning in the Pacific, believing that it must secure the assets of a large colony.

### Tergol's Speech on the French-Syrian Dispute

Lisbon, 3rd (Central News Agency): According to a Paris telegram: General Tergol announced to a group of reporters yesterday that France is now prepared to participate in the peace conference. However, the convening of this peace conference must not only be to mediate the problems between Syria and Lebanon, but also to involve the entire Eastern Arab disposition.

Bern, 3rd (Central News Agency):

According to reports from Beirut: The Rivanda War has ended, and it is currently in a state before the holding of a conference. Order has also been restored in Damascus. Although there are still British troops patrolling the streets in Beirut, the general public is very quiet. The Lebanese delegation attending the Arab League meeting also left Cairo yesterday due to the change in the Rivanda situation.

Post-War Scene in Damascus City

According to those who have visited Damascus, "The current scene in the Syrian capital is very similar to London, England, after being bombed." He told a Reuters reporter that there was indeed damage and destruction in the area, and there were still flames in the streets. Most of the roads can still be repaired, but a small part must be rebuilt.

### Ministry of Social Welfare Plans to Relieve Air Raid Disasters

Nanjing, 3rd (Central News Agency): Since taking office, Minister Peng of the Ministry of Social Welfare has been actively strengthening the ministry's affairs, and is planning to universally relieve air raid disasters in order to relieve the victims, because many innocent civilians have been killed and injured in frequent air raids in various places recently. The ministry is trying its best to find ways to cover the expenses.

### Our Chinese People Under American Blind Bombing

The enemy America attempts to use the Chinese mainland as a battlefield, and indiscriminately bombs innocent Chinese people. In the past, the bombing of Changsha was the most tragic. The picture above shows a major fire in Changsha City after the bombing, and firefighters are working to reduce the fire and rescue people in the flames. The two women on the left and right had their faces injured by shrapnel and moaned in pain. The picture below shows the people who are escaping the bombing with their children and elders. Looking back at their homeland, which has become rubble, they cannot help but feel sad.

### Authorities Negotiate Food Supply Countermeasures; Strictly Prohibit Hoarding and Manipulation; Economic Bureau Director Liu Hopes for Cooperation from All Businessmen and Citizens

After taking office, the new Director of the Municipal Economic Bureau, Liu Xingchen, decided to follow all central economic laws and promote wartime economic policies. He is particularly concerned about the soaring price of rice and the unreasonable rise in other general prices, and is determined to strictly prohibit them. Yesterday, he specially issued a statement, deeply hoping that all businessmen and citizens in the city will cooperate closely to seek the stability of the market. The statement is recorded as follows:

Soaring Rice Prices

A Serious Problem: The current price of rice is a central issue in the city's economy. In recent days, all prices have soared abnormally, especially the price of rice, which has changed several times in an instant, far beyond the usual reason. The reason is that the time between the harvest seasons is too long, transportation is blocked, and the source of supply is not smooth, which has caused anxiety among the citizens. Fearing that rice is not easy to obtain, they rush to buy it. Rice sellers are taking advantage of their psychological anxiety to arbitrarily raise prices, hoping to hoard the commodity. Street talk and alley discussions are full of anxiety. What I see along the way are often people with sunken cheeks and emaciated faces, a heartbreaking sight. If we do not seek relief urgently, the lives of millions of people in Shanghai will be in danger. This is not only an economic problem, but also the most serious social problem. Looking to the future, it is heartbreaking to think about.

Authorities Negotiate

Effective Solutions: I have been ordered to serve as the Director of the Economic Bureau at a time when Shanghai's economy is in a state of chaos. My responsibility is not to be ignored, and I cannot bear to ignore it. Following the instructions of the Mayor and Secretary Wei, I have repeatedly discussed with relevant Allied authorities, and we all believe that the food problem of the citizens of Shanghai is a serious matter. They agreed to provide strong assistance in opening up the source of supply, and will never leave the food supply of millions of citizens in Shanghai unattended. The highest authorities of the municipal government are also negotiating with the highest Allied authorities every day to find effective solutions.

Hoarding for Profit

Punishment According to Law: As for the difficulty of transportation and the lack of materials, this is not just a matter of recent days. Citizens' consumption is the same as before, and the transportation situation is the same as before. Why has the price of rice increased from 100,000 yuan per shi to several times that in just a few days? This is really unreasonable. This must be caused by someone deliberately hoarding for profit. Social stability must be maintained by the common efforts of citizens. No one can be alone in a society where there is unrest. If any hoarding or price manipulation is found, the government will have no hesitation in punishing it according to law. In addition to contacting the Economic Security Office to suppress it, I hope that businessmen and citizens will be self-aware and self-motivated, and not fall into the clutches of the law. I also hope that they will save unnecessary consumption, use miscellaneous grains as substitutes, and get through the time between harvest seasons together. Do not easily believe rumors and frighten each other.

Arbitrary Price Increases

Strict Prohibition: As for the increase in general prices, although there are various reasons, most of them are taking advantage of the opportunity to arbitrarily increase prices, hoping to be opportunistic. No matter what the cost is, it is unreasonable and must be strictly prohibited. Our bureau adheres to economic laws and regulations, and takes implementation as the goal. Under the wartime economic system, general prices must be legal and reasonable. I hope that all businessmen and citizens in the city will cooperate closely and follow the right path together to seek the stability of the market. I cannot help but hope for this.

### The Finance Bureau Prepares to Levy the Summer Business Tax; Simultaneous Levy in the Urban Area and Counties

The Municipal Finance Bureau's levy of the spring business tax was approved in response to the requests of various industries to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce. The tax is only based on the business volume of January, February, and March of this year, and due to time constraints, it first accepted the work of registration and tax payment. As of now, the bureau has collected a total of about 100 million yuan in spring business tax. As for the preliminary review of the tax declarations of various industries, it is currently being actively promoted. It is also learned that the bureau is now preparing to levy the summer business tax. The implementation period is roughly around the beginning of this month. Once the municipal government's reply is received, it will be officially announced. At that time, the levy of this tax will begin simultaneously in the urban area and the suburban counties. Moreover, the actual business volume of various industries in January and February of this year will be used as the standard for assessing the summer business tax for April, May, and June. At the same time, staff will continue to be sent to various designated areas to investigate whether the spring business tax reported by the various businesses is true.

### Last Week's Financial Market Conditions: Intense Fluctuations

The city's financial market conditions, amid the changing international situation, have been unstable. The past week has remained fraught with danger. Although the Central Reserve Bank issued gold securities in an attempt to curb high winds, speculative merchants still used loose funds to stir up trouble, spread rumors, incite people's hearts, and manipulate market prices, thereby reaping illegal profits. Raw silk fluctuated sharply within the week, with highs and lows differing by about forty points. Chinese stocks repeatedly saw new highs. The three hottest stocks experienced active ups and downs. Small and medium-sized stocks mostly rose with few declines. Short selling was initially seen on Monday, followed by a rebound on Tuesday afternoon. Wednesday was even higher. On Thursday, due to some unfavorable news for bulls, large and small stocks were sold off together, with cries of selling everywhere, showing a downward trend. Unexpectedly, there was a sudden turnaround on Friday afternoon, and the rise continued in a straight line on Saturday morning, which was beyond general expectations. Silver, public bonds, and various enemy currencies all continued to rise. In terms of industry and commerce, due to increased commodity costs and reduced production, prices have been raised, especially for major commodities related to people's livelihoods, such as rice, miscellaneous grains, oil, sugar, firewood, charcoal, soap, matches, and candles. The price increases were outrageous and endless, and social livelihood became more serious. The price limits approved by the so-called Market Price Evaluation Committee were all secretly raised by more than double, and people from all walks of life eagerly hope that the municipal authorities will take strong measures to suppress prices to alleviate the people's suffering and avoid further delays.

Letter to the Editor: The Human Rickshaw Pullers' Union wrote to the editor, stating: "We have found that the rickshaw rental was approved by the municipal government on May 29, increasing the original rental price of 950 yuan by 80%, making the daily rental price per vehicle 1,700 yuan. Unexpectedly, your newspaper published on the 2nd of this month: Starting from June 1, the rent will be increased to 4,400 yuan in national currency for a full shift and 2,200 yuan in viewed currency for a half shift, but the car dealers charge 1,700 yuan for a half shift. After reading this, our association immediately inquired with the relevant authorities, and there is no such thing. Therefore, we specially ask your newspaper to grant a correction."

### Alleys and Roads Should Not Be Regarded as Sports Venues

— Gu Qizhong

Alleys and roads are important passages for public transportation and should maintain order and must not be regarded as sports venues for various games, which hinders public transportation. This is known to everyone.

However, some ignorant students, factory workers, or idlers often play kicking large and small balls on the road. Some even play hard tennis balls on the road. Occasionally, if one is not careful, small amounts of mud will splash on people's clothes, and large amounts of ball force will injure people's bodies. Those who come out to dissuade them are often scolded, and violent people even want to commit murder. Such disputes have been seen repeatedly. The most incomprehensible thing is that the police do not interfere.

One day, when the author was passing Madang Road, a ball suddenly flew towards him. Fortunately, he avoided it quickly and was not hit, but it hit the glasses of a cyclist who was driving behind him. The glasses shattered on the ground, and the woman cried loudly. The woman wanted to chase the perpetrator, but he was already far away. Another day, several people were playing ball on Kangding Road, kicking a ball into a pancake vendor's oil pan. Caught off guard, boiling oil splashed on the vendor's face, and blisters immediately appeared, almost covering his eyes. The vendor screamed in pain and wanted to catch them, but the players scattered. Recently, the city has been manufacturing and selling slingshot toys made of lead wire. Most children also play with slingshots on the road, which not only causes harm to each other but also easily endangers the public. They either shoot people's faces or even injure their eyes. Some naughty children often use vehicles as targets for slingshots. One day, a trolleybus on Daxing Road was speeding westward, and a group of children were playing slingshots, and the things they shot out were mostly sand and soybeans. At that time, it hit the forehead of a traveling vendor in the car, and the passenger was unable to get off the car for a while, and only poked his head out of the window and scolded loudly. Such behaviors have to be said to be hateful.

Therefore, it is hoped that the police stationed on the road will prohibit those who endanger public safety and order, and should not fail to interfere because the matter is small, which will hinder order and cause trouble. At the same time, it is also deeply hoped that teachers will warn their students and parents will discipline their children not to play games on the road or in alleys that obstruct traffic.

### Founding of the Air Defense Training Institute Alumni Association: Grand Ceremony Held Yesterday

The Air Defense Training Institute Alumni Association of the Municipal Civil Air Defense Headquarters held its founding meeting at the Dahua Theater on Jing'an Temple Road at 10:00 am yesterday (3rd). Zhou, who is also the Minister (represented by Cao Jingang), representatives from the Shanghai Naval Air Defense Command, the Chief of the Police Defense Department of the Air Defense Headquarters, the Chief of the General Affairs Department, the Deputy Director of the New Chengzhen Branch of the Huangpu Branch, and the honorary presidents of the association Wu and the President Otani Ichisho, as well as more than a thousand members, attended. The police band came to the venue to play music, and the ceremony was grand, and an oath was held.

Presidents

Speech by the President: The President said in his speech, "Today, we are holding the founding meeting, gathering graduates from the three sessions of the Air Defense Training Institute together. The spirit is inspiring, and we are cooperating with each other. I am sincerely gratified. The current situation is becoming increasingly tense. The enemy, Britain and the United States, wants to achieve its aggressive goals and uses various means to attack various parts of Greater East Asia, killing innocent people. At the same time, Greater Shanghai is also the target of its attacks; repeated bombardments have made our air defense mission extremely important. However, the general public in Shanghai still lacks understanding and enthusiasm for air defense. As air defense instructors, all students should assume the important responsibility of guidance and hope that the military, police, and people will work together to complete the air defense mission of Greater Shanghai and protect the safety of Greater Shanghai.

Gu Ji

Wu's Speech Honorary President Gu Wu said in his speech, "Today, we are holding the founding meeting of the alumni association, and all the excellent students are gathered together. This spirit of grasping unity makes me have infinite feelings. I firmly believe that the problems between China and Japan can be very natural, respectful, and cooperative in this harmonious atmosphere. It is comforting to see this. Looking at the fact that Germany and France were incited by ambitious European and American countries and launched struggles, the result was that both were defeated and injured, and they encountered the same fate. We East Asians should wake up. China and Japan are of the same origin and should stand on the same line. The position of our Republic of China is to seek freedom, independence, and survival, and we must follow the will of President Sun and unite with the nations of the world that treat us equally and strive together. Japan is the nation that treats us equally. The invasion policies of Britain and the United States against our country have been thoroughly understood by insightful people. The East does not put the yellow people in their hearts; therefore, without Japan, there is no East Asia, without China, there is no Japan, and without Japan, there is no China. The relationship between China and Japan is extremely close. We should live and die together and cooperate to defend Greater East Asia. Enemy planes have repeatedly attacked Shanghai and killed innocent people. We should strengthen our air defense mission, just like the mission we have rationally recognized. At the same time, the significance of this mission is very great. All our students are voluntary and take the truth of serving society and helping each other as the premise. Therefore, I hope that everyone will unite in spirit and strengthen the air defense mission, and I wish you all good health."

Zhou Bu

Chang's Speech The Chief Secretary Cao Jingang delivered a speech on behalf of Minister Zhou, saying, "Today, we are holding the founding meeting of the Air Defense Training Institute Alumni Association. On behalf of Minister Zhou, I would like to say a few words to the students. Seeing your spirit of unity and vigor, I am infinitely admired. The current situation is becoming increasingly serious. In today's era of scientific advancement, air combat is becoming more and more advanced. Enemy planes are wantonly bombing and killing innocent people. We should strengthen our defense work. Shanghai is the center of China's politics, economy, and culture and is likely to be attacked at any time. The authorities have established the Municipal Civil Air Defense Headquarters to strengthen the city's air defense work and train outstanding young people as instructors. The graduates of the three sessions are already more than 600 people. Today's founding meeting of the alumni association is the starting point for future work. Please sincerely guide the public with the various skills and academics you have learned, and from now on, develop a new spirit, unite as one, research together, cooperate and help each other, and promote the overall strength, then its effect will be greater. At the same time, we should recognize that Greater Shanghai is our hometown, and we are all members of the city. We should work together with the five million citizens to protect Greater Shanghai. I wish you all good health and a bright future." Subsequently, the Chief of the Police Defense Department, representatives of the Japanese Naval Air Defense Command, and others gave speeches one after another, with many words of encouragement. After the speeches, the founding declaration was read. Finally, the air defense film "Blast and Shrapnel" was shown, which ended at about 12 o'clock.

Founding

Declaration Founding Declaration of the Air Defense Training Institute Alumni Association: The Air Defense Training Institute Alumni Association has been successfully established today with the cooperation and support of the Air Defense Headquarters. From now on, we graduates will have a group organization, and we will use the group's strength to deal with sudden terrorist air raids at any time to minimize the damage suffered by citizens, and we will also use this to exert the great power of our air defense instructors. At the beginning of the establishment of this association, we would like to briefly state the purpose of the organization as follows: First, to improve the efficiency of air defense and increase the public's knowledge of air defense. In the current situation where the war has reached the final stage, the crisis of air raids is imminent. Although the authorities stipulate that the 9th of each month is Air Defense Day, and air defense exercises are widely implemented to arouse the public's vigilance and complete all necessary air defense preparations, so that the public will not panic in times of danger, but in fact, most citizens either do not understand the meaning of air defense and sit idly by, or have not received sufficient training, and although they are determined to defend the air, they suffer from poor skills and cannot exert their abilities. This requires the guidance of our graduates, explaining the advantages and disadvantages, and teaching the skills, so that all residents of the city can know and do everything, so that they will not be unworthy of the name of air defense instructor. However, the strength of individuals is limited, and knowledge and experience are even more insufficient. When implementing work, the methods cannot be perfect, and various obstacles will inevitably arise. If we can work together and consistently, we can solve the difficulties of individuals with the strength of the group, and we have the advice of various leaders, teachers, and elders, which will not only improve personal knowledge but also improve the efficiency of guiding citizens. In other words, there is greater strength to contribute to society. Second, to connect feelings and encourage each other. Although we are strong young people, we have also studied together, and we are all determined to serve the people. Under the banner of air defense, we are united in pace, but we may not be able to work with each other because of the different times of training or the different regions in which we live. There are many people who are not interwoven with each other. Now we can gather together from time to time under the organization of the Alumni Association to encourage and learn from each other, which can not only gather ideas and benefit from each other, but also connect feelings and enhance friendship. The purpose of this association is as described above. Fortunately, all my classmates can deeply understand, practice, and make this association shine, so that leading the citizens can safely survive the great disaster of air raids.
