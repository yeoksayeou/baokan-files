### Prime Minister Koiso's Radio Address: Urging the People to Rise Up and Fight to the End, Only Victory Can Open the Way Out of the National Crisis

Tokyo, 22nd (Central News Agency) - Prime Minister Koiso gave a radio address at 7:20 PM on the 21st, entitled "Opening the Way Out of the National Crisis," stating: "The fall of Iwo Jima is indeed a major turning point in the Greater East Asia War. It is something that fills people with the utmost hatred. A corner of the great Japanese Empire, with its long and glorious history, has been subjected to the enemy's wanton ravaging. Although the island is a barren islet, it still evokes a sense of foreign humiliation and internal invasion. In the national crisis of the Mongol invasions, Iki and Tsushima fell into enemy hands for a time, but we ultimately achieved victory. Similarly, the loss of Iwo Jima is a prerequisite for the final victory of the Greater East Asia War. Due to the fall of the island, our belief in certain victory is even more steadfast. As the war gradually extends to the homeland, and the enemy attempts to land on our shores, we, standing in this situation and experiencing the past, anticipate that the future war situation will become even more fierce. However, we are deeply fortunate to have achieved this kind of outcome under these circumstances. At this critical juncture for the rise and fall of the Imperial Country of Japan and the survival of the Yamato race, only victory can save us. Citizens, arise quickly, concentrate all your efforts, and accomplish the war's objectives."

Tokyo, 22nd (Central News Agency) - Vice Minister of the Army, Mr. Shibayama, stated on the 21st in response to a question from Mr. Miyazaki Ichiro at the Special Military Measures Law Committee of the House of Representatives, that preparations were being made to annihilate the enemy in the ocean and waters, stating: "If the enemy attempts to attack the homeland, we will concentrate all our efforts to annihilate them at sea in one fell swoop. If the enemy lands on the homeland, we will unleash a massive military force to annihilate them along the coast. We firmly believe that this method is the most perfect, and that is why we have proposed it in this bill."

### Imperial Headquarters Announces Yesterday: One Enemy Battleship Damaged, Seven Remaining Enemy Aircraft Carriers Fled Eastward

Tokyo, 22nd (Central News Agency) - The Imperial Headquarters announced at 3:30 PM on the 22nd: "Among the results of the attack on the enemy's mobile unit on the 21st, what has now been confirmed is as follows: one battleship damaged."

Tokyo, 22nd (Central News Agency) - Enemy General Nimitz made a ridiculous and exaggerated propaganda regarding the American carrier-based aircraft's air raids on Japan, Kyushu, Shikoku, and the Chugoku regions on the 18th and 19th. However, the damage to the Japanese side was extremely minor. The enemy's American mobile unit began retreating to the southern sea area on the 20th. The Japanese Air Special Attack Force and bomber squadrons launched continuous fierce attacks from morning to evening on the 21st, severely damaging one of their battleships in the first strike, with two pillars of fire rising from the ocean surface. This is a sign of the enemy ship sinking. In addition, 11 special attack aircraft rammed and bombed, and three bombs were dropped in the process. The results have not yet been determined. By the evening of the 21st, the enemy mobile unit had opened up its speed and fled eastward from the sea east of the Ryukyu Islands. According to Japanese reconnaissance, the core force of the aircraft carriers was only seven. The number of those sunk or damaged was at least seven or nine. Due to the attack on the night of the 21st, the enemy mobile unit suffered great damage, and its remaining strength was only half of its original strength.

Tokyo, 21st (Central News Agency) - The enemy mobile unit, which had been under fierce attack by the Japanese Air Force for two days since the 18th, could not sustain itself and fled in a panic like fish escaping a net. According to the facts, it can be seen that the main force of this enemy mobile unit was undoubtedly the 58th Mobile Task Force. However, after this fierce battle, it is clear that its throat has been strangled by the Japanese Air Force.

### Manchukuo Minister Zhongshan Talks About Mission and Spirit

Nanjing, 22nd (Central News Agency) - Mr. Zhongshan Yu, the newly appointed Minister of Manchukuo to China, received Chinese and foreign reporters from the capital at the Embassy at 3:00 PM on the 22nd and elaborated in detail on the mission of Manchukuo and the spirit of Manchukuo's founding. The main points are recorded as follows: The mission of Manchukuo is to promote the relationship between China and Japan. The only way is to thoroughly popularize the spirit of Manchukuo's founding in the hearts of the people of both China and Japan. This time, I am coming to China with the desire to get along with Chinese people as a citizen of Manchukuo, so that old Chinese friends can understand my personal thoughts and attitudes, and further understand the spirit of Manchukuo's founding, which is not understood by Chinese youth. I would like to briefly explain it here. Recalling the time of the Russo-Japanese War, Japan's victory can be said to have been an opportunity. At that time, Japan was guarding itself, and how to deal with the Western European forces was the biggest and most difficult problem. Japan lacked population and resources, and had to find a base in mainland China. In contrast, China had extremely abundant manpower and resources. Helpless Japan had no choice but to ask for China's assistance. In this way, the crises encountered by China, Japan, and Manchuria can be eliminated, and the security of the entire East Asia can be guaranteed. However, at that time, China was in the midst of internal strife, and its vision was shallow and old, and it failed to deeply understand Japan. Therefore, the Manchurian Incident occurred. The founding of Manchukuo can be regarded as a kind of local revolution. It was Manchuria built by the local people with their own strength. There are Han people, Japanese people, and other ethnic groups. All ethnic groups and clans cooperate with each other and engage in the founding of the country. Moreover, we want to expand this spirit, harmonize the relationship between China and Japan, and connect them into one. This is the spirit of Manchukuo's founding. The Iwo Jima battle is very painful. In the future, the second and third Iwo Jima incidents may continue to come. This battle is certainly more important than the previous decision. Therefore, it is difficult to predict who the final victory will belong to.

### Japanese Information Bureau Announces Labor Mobilization Plan

Tokyo, 22nd (Central News Agency) - The Japanese government, in view of the importance of labor mobilization under the decisive battle, decided on the implementation plan for labor mobilization during the war period at the emergency cabinet meeting on the 21st. The Information Bureau announced the decision on the 22nd as follows: In order to cope with the severity of the war situation and to strengthen the construction of defense and air defense facilities, the increase in food production, the production of weapons, and transportation departments, the government will adjust the overall mobilization in the future in order to achieve rapid and thorough implementation.

### United Reserve Bank Issues 500 Yuan Notes

Peiping, 22nd (Central News Agency) - The China United Reserve Bank has specially printed new 500 yuan and 10 yuan notes to regulate chips, which will be circulated on the market from the 23rd.

### Ministry of Industry Permits Merchants to Freely Transport Coal

Nanjing, 22nd (Central News Agency) - The Ministry of Industry recently spoke about the fuel supply situation as follows: The Ministry has formulated measures to increase coal production and dredge the source of supply, which will be implemented soon. In addition to the above measures, it has also been agreed with relevant parties to allow merchants to freely transport coal stored by the Huainan Coal Mining Company to meet the needs. The transportation method is that merchants freely apply for transportation, but they must formulate a transportation plan to facilitate contact with all relevant parties. The price is based on the appropriate price at the place of production. Merchants can freely sell all the coal they transport. The Ministry is currently mobilizing powerful merchants to engage in transportation, and the source of coal supply is expected to improve in the future.

### Second Preparatory Meeting of Wartime Public Conference

### Cabinet Ministers of the Kingdom of Eastern Cambodia Have Been Decided

### One American Submarine Sinks in the Pacific

Lisbon, 22nd (Central News Agency) - Washington electric message, the US Department of the Navy announced on the 21st: The US submarine Perch (1525 tons) was patrolling in the Pacific Ocean and has not returned to this day, and it has been confirmed that it has sunk.

### Strength of the US Pacific Fleet Has Been Sharply Reduced

Central News Agency - Regarding the composition of the enemy's US Pacific Fleet, the Third, Fifth, Seventh, and Ninth Fleets, the Third and Fifth Fleets are the most powerful, which is well known to the world. The enemy uses these two fleets as the core, and then uses the other two fleets as reinforcements. In the past, the enemy's 58th Mobile Task Force and 38th Mobile Task Force were formed as the main force for attacking Japan. However, after moving from the central Pacific and the west, the number of carrier-based aircraft installed was 2,500. In the waters off Taiwan and the Philippines, it has suffered major blows. The Third Fleet led by Commander Halsey was unable to use the name of the established fleet after being attacked. Therefore, in the past month, the authority of the Third Fleet in Guam has been handed over to the Fifth Fleet managed by Sporangus, and Halsey himself secretly returned to Washington. The so-called enemy's US Fifth Fleet, we have observed in fact, has been completely eliminated. On February 16, the United States mobilized all the strength of its Pacific Fleet to launch an attack on the sea near Tokyo and assisted in the landing operation on Iwo Jima. The total number of carrier-based aircraft was more than 1,200. On March 1, when it attacked the sea near Ryukyu again, the number of carrier-based aircraft was 800. In fact, the measured number was only 400 or 500. Regarding the characteristics of the enemy mobile unit that launched this attack, there are various predictions. According to the announcement by the Nimitz Command, the commander-in-chief of the mobile unit Sporangus, the commander of the aircraft carrier unit Mitchell, in our observation, this is also the main force of the Pacific Fleet. However, comparing the enemy's US Pacific Fleet since before the sea off Taiwan, the number of aircraft has gradually decreased from 2,500 to 1,200, 800, and 400 or 500. The enemy's straight-line reduction in its combat power is very clear. Especially in our calculations, the total number was five points before, but now it has sharply fallen to one-fifth. The situation should be even clearer. In that operation, the enemy suffered heavy blows. Two enemy regular aircraft carriers were sunk, one aircraft carrier or battleship was sunk, one battleship or cruiser was sunk, two destroyers and two ships of unknown type were sunk. The two regular aircraft carriers that were destroyed had 183 aircraft destroyed, one destroyed and one burned. At the same time, it is evident that four regular aircraft carriers were destroyed and sunk. Therefore, the combat power of this enemy American mobile unit has been greatly reduced. Our judgment is that the Japanese army's combat results have destroyed one-third of the enemy's force. Therefore, the enemy's Pacific Fleet has suffered a huge blow, which is very clear. Although the enemy's American public opinion organs constantly trumpet and shout about landing on the Japanese mainland or approaching the Chinese coast, we now observe that the enemy's combat power is deeply feeling difficult in combat, while on the Japanese side, that is what is hoped for.

### Recent Outlook on the International Situation (II) - Broadcast Speech by Minister Matsudaira -

The tendency of antagonism between Britain and the United States has stirred up subtle waves in the recent international situation in East Asia. As for the reason, it is Britain's dissatisfaction with the "unruly" attitude of the United States. To give a concrete example, the initial problem was this: the United States criticized Britain's India policy. The United States sent special envoy Phillips to India to study Britain's policy and came to the conclusion that "Britain should immediately grant India independence," which was submitted to the US government. Britain believed that the United States was meddling in its affairs, and the feelings between the two countries deteriorated day by day. Phillips fled back to his country from India.

Secondly, the opinions of Britain and the United States differed on the issue of Hong Kong and the Kowloon Peninsula. The United States advocated returning them to China, but Britain believed that whether to return them or not was its own decision and did not allow the United States to interfere. Recently, there was also an interesting event, that is, the fallout between US Pacific Fleet Commander Nimitz and British Pacific Fleet Commander Flasier. Flasier demanded that the British fleet participate in the battle, but Nimitz refused, saying that the British fleet was slow and the warships were old-fashioned, so it was better to watch the fun from the sidelines! The British newspapers were not willing to show weakness, and repeatedly said in the newspapers, "What is this? The originator of the Navy is also Britain!" In short, seemingly the best partners on the surface have similar conflicts from time to time.

What about Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union in Europe?

What about Europe? Because the interests are intertwined, the situation is also extremely complicated. The root cause is that Britain and the Soviet Union cannot agree, and the United States stands in a mediating position. The Soviet Union has adopted its own policy towards the countries of Finland, the three Balkan countries, Poland, and Romania, and does not allow anyone else to step in. His policy is also gradually expanding to Bulgaria. In addition, it has taken measures to insert itself into other countries, such as dispatching communist members to serve as cabinet ministers, or expressing friendship with Tergol, in an attempt to expand its influence.

In response to this environment, Britain placed Turkey and the Netherlands under its own sphere of influence, sent troops to garrison Greece, and was anxiously trying to place Yugoslavia under its sphere of influence, and welcomed France as a friend. It can be seen that it is struggling to prevent the expansion of Soviet power in continental Europe.

This kind of friction between Britain and the Soviet Union can be seen everywhere in Poland, Yugoslavia, Greece, the Bono government in Italy, and France, etc. However, in various parts of Europe that have suffered from the war, economic depression and food panic have occurred everywhere. From an objective point of view, it has become a hotbed of communism. Britain is now also aware that if these political problems cannot be resolved, they will affect the war.

At the Tehran Conference, they agreed on the principle of war first, and political issues would be resolved after the war, but in any case, they would inevitably become a problem in the future. The United States and Britain are worried that the Soviet Union is creating a fait accompli step by step. Therefore, at the Crimean Conference, the highest leaders of the three countries, Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union, conducted consultations.

The Crimean Conference was held in Yalta, Crimea Peninsula from February 4 to 11, for a total of eight days. Roosevelt, Churchill, and Stalin led military and diplomatic staff to attend. The main points of their decisions are as follows: (1) War plan against Germany; (2) Make Germany surrender unconditionally and compensate for losses; (3) According to the Dumbarton Oaks decision, promote the organization of a peace mechanism and convene a United Nations conference; (4) Concretely realize the democracy of small European countries and reaffirm the Atlantic Charter; (5) Establish a new Polish government; (6) Promote the establishment of a government in Yugoslavia through cooperation between Tito and Shebasic; (7) Regularly convene meetings of the foreign ministers of the three countries. The above is the result of this meeting, but before the meeting, Roosevelt sent special advisor Hopkins to Europe to lobby in London, Paris, and Rome for the US position, so that the meeting could proceed smoothly. This shows the difficulty of the meeting after a long period of negotiation. Stalin seemed to return home immediately after the meeting, but Roosevelt and Churchill held another meeting in Alexandria on their way back home, which ended hastily after only four hours. The content of the discussion was about the war against Japan. It was heard that Britain advocated that after the war against Germany came to an end, it would devote all its efforts to deal with the war against Japan.

Roosevelt also parked the cruiser he was on in the Suez Canal and met with the kings of Egypt, Abyssinia, and Saudi Arabia. Churchill also met with the kings of these three countries and the President of Syria one after another and had important talks on military and political matters. Roosevelt also sent a state official to Moscow and ordered him to detour to Mexico to attend the Pan-American Conference. Roosevelt himself invited Tergol to meet in Egypt, but Tergol politely declined. This shows that France is not interested in the tripartite talks. At the Crimean Conference, it is said that other secret understandings were agreed upon. Those who did not declare war on the Axis powers before March 1 would not be allowed to attend the San Francisco International Security Conference. This may be one of the secret understandings. Therefore, the six South American countries responded by declaring war. The countries of the Near East, such as Turkey, Egypt, Syria, and Lebanon, were forced to decide when Luo and Qiu met with the kings and presidents of those countries. (To be continued)

Editorial

### Society Before the Individual

When Mayor Zhou took office, he issued a letter to the citizens of Shanghai, in which he mentioned the two sentences "Public interest is more important than private interest, and society comes before the individual." In order to elaborate on the meaning of these two sentences, and at the same time, awaken the general public in Shanghai, especially the influential members of society, to the importance of these two sentences, we will not be annoyed by tedious thrice expositions (see editorials of February 7, February 8, and March 6). The reason why we have repeatedly pointed out the facts is that the phenomenon of only caring about private interests and not caring about public interests, and only having individuals and no society, is too widespread in the current Shanghai society. If it is not changed, the corruption of society will lead to collapse, which can be asserted. We are unwilling to sit idly by and watch society corrupt and collapse, so we cannot but speak frankly about the advantages and disadvantages in order to warn the general public.

The phenomenon of only caring about private interests and not caring about public interests is most conspicuously exposed in: everyone flocks to private affairs, fearing that they will be too late; everyone avoids public affairs like poison, fearing that they will not be able to shirk their responsibilities. Trying to observe from recent events, it can be fully verified. One is the matter of low-priced rice. At the beginning of contacting the purchase of low-priced rice, the price difference between the low-priced rice and the black market rice was almost negligible. Although it was assigned to all sectors of industry and commerce, they still waited and watched, and were not interested. When the deadline for payment arrived, they were still hesitant. Later, the black market price of rice soared, and the difference from the low-priced rice was extremely large. As a result, the previous negative attitude turned into a positive one, and the matter of competing for purchase and demand followed. The reason why the attitude before and after is different lies in the shift of the private interest. One is the matter of military and police donations and winter relief funds, which are completely public welfare matters. From a narrow point of view, there is indeed no private interest at all. Therefore, although the public associations of various industries and commerce have been separately allocated, it is either an excuse or a delay.

Recently, the municipal government issued 150,000,000 yuan of relief treasury bonds, of which 50,000,000 yuan were designated for various trade associations to subscribe in different grades. This is another completely public welfare matter. It is rumored that because public welfare matters in society have been promoted one after another, the industry and commerce associations feel burdened, so some members withdraw from the association and some responsible persons of the association resign. If the withdrawal and resignation are for internal relations, it can be ignored. If the motive is to avoid the burden of public welfare, then public opinion in society will never give up criticism. In fact, there are also restrictions on the withdrawal of association members in law, and the resignation of the person in charge of the association is still a member of the industry and still a citizen of Shanghai, and public welfare undertakings are still inescapable. In the past, in the era of concessions, it was possible to escape under the protection of the British and Americans. The current era environment is completely different. Public welfare matters cannot be escaped, nor can they be haggled over. This should be recognized clearly.

Of the 150,000,000 yuan of relief treasury bonds issued by the municipal government, 100,000,000 yuan is used to make up for the past difference in rationed rice, which is related to the public welfare of all citizens. 50,000,000 yuan is used as temporary relief funds, which is also related to the public welfare of citizens. On the government side, we of course expect to take it from the citizens and use it for the citizens. On the side of the industry and commerce associations, each member is engaged in profit-making, and it can also be said to be taken from the public. Then, it is also a matter of course to fulfill some obligations for the public welfare of the public. Even if the quantity of graded allocations is compared with the actual strength of the members of various industry associations, there is really plenty of leeway. If everyone pays a little attention to public welfare and raises the money as required, it is by no means difficult. Therefore, we hope that the responsible persons of various industry associations will deeply understand the righteousness, attach importance to public welfare, inform fellow members of the industry, and set an example for fellow members of the industry. For example, among our fellow journalists, there are only six Chinese companies, and they are not within the scope of the association. However, we first assumed 6,000,000 yuan. Judging from the economic strength of each newspaper, it is extremely difficult. However, because it is public welfare, there is an obligation to bear it, and we cannot but try our best to overcome the difficulties.

We have said: "Shanghai's rise and fall, the people of Shanghai are responsible." Especially the leaders of various industries and circles, have greater responsibilities. Only by adhering to the attitude of "Public interest is more important than private interest, and society comes before the individual," actively planning for public welfare, we must first jointly overcome the crisis of Shanghai society, and then we can maintain personal interests.

### The City Has Abundant Edible Oil Reserves

The supply of edible oil in the city has long been a superficial shortage. Common merchants are limiting the release of their stocks to profit from scarcity, making it difficult to meet demand. However, according to information gathered by reporters from relevant sources, Shanghai has extremely abundant edible oil reserves. According to unofficial estimates, current reserves are at least 20,000 dan or more. In addition, recently large quantities of edible oil have arrived from various ports by truck and boat. According to sources within the industry, if this edible oil were widely available on the market, it could meet the city's needs for several months. Therefore, with reserves and supply sources as they are, there should be no problems with the supply of edible oil in the future. It has also been heard that the authorities are actively working on a rationing system for oil, which is expected to be launched soon.

### Ningbo Zhuangyuan Restaurant Penalized for Evading Special Consumption Tax

The Ningbo Zhuangyuan Restaurant at 680 Fuzhou Road was investigated and penalized by the Finance Bureau for evading special consumption tax. The investigation revealed that, in addition to recording part of its business in formal ledgers, the remaining business was recorded in an anonymous notebook.

### Elementary School Students Sympathize with Those Out of School and Solicit "Charity School Funds" from Relatives and Friends

We are very touched by the enthusiastic support for the "Charity School Funds" from readers these past few days. However, in terms of the scope of support, it tends to be biased towards students, especially elementary school students and struggling students, which is truly "misery loves company," and even more intimate. Why are other readers with more resources not providing support? After careful consideration, we believe that readers with resources and experience may think that this matter is too large, the responsibilities are too difficult, and it is not easy to handle well, so they are temporarily taking a wait-and-see approach. We do not deny this view, and we are willing to do our best to achieve results that will earn public support. Yesterday, we received letters from several pure-hearted children expressing their enthusiasm and hope.

(1) The six students receiving scholarship assistance from this newspaper responded to our "Charity School Funds" initiative with a letter stating: "We six are all students on scholarships provided by your newspaper. Without the help of scholarships, we would all be out of school. We thank your newspaper and the millions of readers for their cultivation. Recently, we saw in your newspaper the news of establishing ten charity elementary schools and launching the "Charity School Funds" initiative, and we were very touched. However, our strength is limited. Following the principle of "those with money contribute money, those with strength contribute strength," we will do our best to solicit donations from relatives and friends, totaling 2,000 yuan in Central Reserve Certificates, to be used as "Charity School Funds."

We hope that philanthropists will launch another "Charity School Funds" donation drive to help a group of poor children who are out of school have the opportunity to study like us. We also hope that the students who receive scholarship assistance from your newspaper will also do the same as us and unanimously solicit donations from relatives and friends."

(2) Four children, He Xingdi, Yu Jingjuan, Xu Lijuan, and Huang Jinzhu, wrote: "We four are very righteous, but we want to extend our righteousness. Today, we saw that your newspaper launched the "Charity School Funds" initiative to help children out of school. This is a very righteous work, and we should respond to it. Now, we are contributing the money we have saved on weekdays, totaling 66 yuan, and asking you to include it in the "Charity School Funds" donations. We will send it again after we save more."

(3) An elementary school student, Cheng Jinlong, wrote: "I am a carefree elementary school student, but I was very touched to see your newspaper launch the "Charity School Funds" initiative, because how painful it is for children without books to read! Although I myself don't have much money, I can ask others to donate. Now, I have solicited 2,500 yuan in Central Reserve Certificates from my friend Mr. Hou Yuanlong, which I ask you to include under the "Charity School Funds" item. Please also publish it in the newspaper to show credibility."

### Charity School Funds Donation Report (4)

Six students receiving assistance 2,000 yuan, He Xingdi, Yu Jingjuan, Xu Lijuan, and Huang Jinzhu together 6,000 yuan, Cheng Jinlong 2,500 yuan, total received 10,500 yuan, plus previous balance 1,057,800

### Preferential Treatment for the Poor and Sick

(1) Nanshi Civilian Hospital: The Nanshi Civilian Hospital moved to its new address at 775 Minguo Road last month. In addition to adding various equipment such as a surgical operating room, electrotherapy room, and chemical laboratory, it has also installed a giant X-ray machine for patients to undergo examination, fluoroscopy, and photography all day long. Morning consultations and registration are free, purely to serve the poor and sick. Specialists in internal and external medicine are hired to be responsible for diagnosis and treatment, and free beds are provided to benefit society, which is by no means insignificant.

(2) Wuxi Ren Ci Nursing Home: Mr. Lu Buzhou, a pioneer in the city's printing industry, founded the Ren Ci Nursing Home a year ago in Guanshe Mountain, Wuxi, under the direction of specialists such as Drs. Wang Shibu and Li Jialin. The environment is beautiful, the treatment is thorough, and X-rays, artificial pneumothorax, and other facilities are available at a particularly low cost. Last winter, on the occasion of Mr. Lu's 50th birthday, he used the congratulatory gifts and banquet expenses from his relatives and friends to establish ten fully-funded medical and food beds annually to specifically assist impoverished teachers suffering from lung diseases, to create benefits for his relatives and friends. All current elementary school teachers in this city who are truly unable to afford treatment and have been certified by the principal of their original school can be admitted. Detailed information can be obtained by writing to the hospital's Shanghai office at No. 4, Lane 384, Fuzhou Road.

(3) Lung Disease Clinic: The Lung Disease Clinic at 700 Yuyuan Road is hosted by Dr. Weng Zhefu, who provides consultations and medicines free of charge. He continues to provide free consultations every day from 10:00 AM to 12:00 PM, and provides medicines as appropriate. Twenty free consultation tickets are available and can be picked up in person at this office, while supplies last.

Puji Pills - Saving the World - Longquan Pharmaceutical Factory: Longquan Puji Pills are effective for all seasonal illnesses and are priced low. In order to promote widespread use, in addition to expanding the consignment sales portion, it is also distributing them for free to the poor and sick at the distribution point (No. 25, Lane 761, Jiangsu Road). Each package is still sold at the old price of 60 yuan.

### Enemy's Next Operation Against America to Fall into a State of Chaos - Minister Matsushima Discusses the European and Asian War Situation

The Allied Japanese Fleet Press Department held a regular meeting yesterday afternoon. Minister Matsushima, Lieutenant Matsumoto, and reporters from various newspapers attended. First, Minister Matsushima reported on the Pacific war situation, including recent losses of the US Navy. He then discussed the European war situation. An outline of his speech follows:

Pacific War Situation: Recently, the US Navy's mobile force suffered significant damage in the seas south of Kyushu and Shikoku. Over one-third of its aircraft carriers were lost, and battleships, cruisers, destroyers, and carrier-based aircraft all sustained heavy damage. They are currently retreating southward. The Japanese air force is pursuing the retreating enemy. Enemy propaganda claimed that a fleet had attacked Japan's Seto Inland Sea, alleging that the Japanese side suffered considerable losses. However, the Japanese side has not received any such report. The intention behind this speculation is nothing more than to cover up their own losses. The enemy boldly approached the Japanese coast, intending to engage the Japanese fleet in a decisive battle. However, they underestimated Japanese air power, suffered a severe blow, and retreated in defeat. On the 18th and 19th, the sea conditions were exceptionally bad, preventing the Japanese from completely annihilating the enemy, but at least the enemy's attempt was severely thwarted. The enemy's aircraft carrier group's supply line was severely hit, and casualties exceeded 10,000. According to the US announcement, a new-type aircraft carrier, named "Midway," displacing 44,000 tons, was launched on March 1st. This is a typical propaganda tactic by the Americans, intended to explain away their operational losses. With such significant losses for the American military, their next operation will undoubtedly fall into a state of extreme chaos, which is very clear. Therefore, no matter from which direction the enemy attacks, the result will inevitably be heavy losses.

Iwo Jima Battle Situation: The heroic actions of the Japanese army on Iwo Jima have startled ghosts and gods and moved heaven and earth. In the past month, the Japanese army, with a very small force, has achieved unprecedented results in history. The enemy's landing Marine Corps suffered losses of over half, at least 80%. If the enemy plans to land on the Japanese mainland in the future, this example can be seen as the prelude to the operation. Based on strategy, and for the sake of preparing for the decisive battle, the Japanese army could not help but temporarily abandon this island. It is deeply believed that in the near future, the heroic spirits of the warriors on this island will receive considerable consolation.

We cannot predict what the enemy's definite course of action will be, but they will certainly be active in the near future. Judging from the recent situation, the enemy's activities are less likely to be aimed at approaching the mainland and more likely to be directed at the Japanese mainland. The enemy's air force on the mainland has not been very active recently. It is impossible to speculate for the time being as to what we are preparing for the next operation. However, based on the situation in the Philippines, there is a high possibility that the British and American forces will come from Mindanao towards Borneo and Vietnam. In any case, once the enemy approaches the mainland, they will inevitably treat the Chinese people with cruelty and abuse. Therefore, we must do our utmost to prevent them from landing on the mainland.

European War Situation: The Soviet army's encirclement of Danzig has been largely completed on the Eastern Front. The 70 divisions led by Soviet General Govorov have formed an attacking posture towards Berlin from Stettin and Frankfurt. The strength of these 70 divisions is stronger than the 60 divisions commanded by US General Montgomery on the Western Front, thus posing a major threat to the British and Americans. The 1st Ukrainian Front led by Konev is advancing westward south of Bislo to provide assistance, but the German forces near the Warta River are fighting exceptionally bravely, making the Soviet advance very difficult. In the southern Slovak mountain region, the German forces are currently holding their ground, preventing the Soviet advance. The Soviet and Wehrmacht forces are engaged in fierce fighting in Bucharest, especially the battle of the Parauton River, which is the most intense. The area west of the Rhine River is now controlled by the Allied forces, but the German forces on the west bank continue their methodical activities. In the north, the Canadian army and the US 1st Army are attacking Huysaye without making progress. The US 3rd and 7th Armies to the south are also attacking fiercely. In this battle, when the Allied forces crossed the Rhine River and advanced into the Kern-Buhon and Remagen areas, they expanded their bridgeheads, which were very strong. Although the mountain battles in the south are very fierce, the German army is taking advantage of the natural defenses and resisting strongly. The US military recently added the 15th Army in the north, planning to cross the plains in one go and attack Berlin. German Field Marshal Rundstedt is aware of everything and is currently preventing their attack. We express our utmost respect for the German army and its people's courageous fight for life and death, and pray for their victory. Recently, German submarines have been very active in the Baltic Sea and the North Sea and have achieved considerable success, which is also worthy of our admiration.

### Chinese Health Association to Promote TB Screening; Half-Price Screening Certificates Sold by This Office

Being free from illness is a blessing in life; one only realizes the importance of health when sick. In major cities, tuberculosis is the most widespread infectious disease. According to recent statistics, the spread of tuberculosis has exceeded previous records, significantly affecting public health. The current TB prevention week held in this city, expanding publicity, has great significance. The Chinese Health Association at 996 Jing'an Temple Road is promoting TB prevention work by holding half-price X-ray examinations to popularize diagnosis and early treatment, in order to achieve the goal of saving medical expenses. Modern medicine has progressed from treating diseases to preventing diseases, with TB prevention being the most effective.

Symptoms: Fever, weight loss, cough, insomnia, night sweats, fatigue. Diagnosis: Modern X-ray examination is the simplest and most accurate method.

Statistics: According to recent statistics in the "Xinwenbao" regarding TB loan funds, the number of infected employees reached over 20%, mostly young people aged 20 to 30, which is a serious problem.

Examination Method: TB X-ray examination certificates are sold by this office at half price for 700 yuan per certificate (from today until the end of this month).

Tuberculosis is a chronic infectious disease that causes countless cases of poverty and misery in society and families. It is no exaggeration to call it a "racial disease." We hope that leaders of all units, such as parents, principals, shop owners, and managers of companies and stores, will fulfill their responsibilities and promote and implement screening as much as possible among their subordinates. The more widespread the screening, the safer the society will be.
