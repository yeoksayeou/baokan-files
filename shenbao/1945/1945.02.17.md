### Local Japanese Air Defense Units Launch Interception Battles Against the Enemy; Iwo Jima Subjected to Enemy Naval Bombardment Yesterday Morning

Tokyo, 16th (Central News Agency) – The Imperial Japanese Headquarters announced at 6:30 PM on the 16th: A powerful enemy mobile force appeared in the vicinity of Japan. From around 7:00 AM to approximately 4:00 PM on the 16th, they carried out wave after wave of attacks on Japanese airfields in the Kanto region and Shizuoka Prefecture using their main force of carrier-based aircraft. Japanese air defense units in various locations launched interception battles against this enemy and achieved considerable results. An enemy fleet consisting of over thirty warships, including battleships and aircraft carriers, has been conducting naval bombardments of Iwo Jima since the morning of the 16th.

Tokyo, 16th (Central News Agency) – The enemy American mobile force, which appeared near Taiwan and the Philippines at the end of January, reappeared near Japan on the 16th and launched its first large-scale bombing raid on the Japanese mainland using its carrier-based aircraft. Simultaneously, an enemy mobile force consisting of over thirty warships, including battleships and aircraft carriers, has been conducting naval bombardments of Iwo Jima, the forward defense of Japan's Pacific line, since the morning of the 16th. The enemy mobile force appearing near Japan is the main force of the enemy American naval power in the Pacific Ocean, centered around over ten aircraft carriers. The total number of enemy carrier-based aircraft attacking Japan is over one thousand. The enemy American use of such a large number of carrier-based aircraft to attack Japan, along with the naval bombardment of Iwo Jima, proves that the enemy intends to attempt a landing on Iwo Jima in the near future, which is not difficult to predict. The enemy mobile force continues to maneuver near Japan, and its carrier-based aircraft may attack the Japanese mainland again on the 17th. The enemy's attempt to seize the Iwo Jima area has two strategic implications: Iwo Jima is a base from which the Japanese military attacks enemy American bases in the Mariana Islands. When B-29s bomb the Japanese mainland, they are repeatedly and quickly detected by the Japanese military's surveillance network on Iwo Jima, resulting in significant losses, so there is a need to occupy it. If the enemy occupies Iwo Jima, it can be used as a base for fighter escorts for B-29s. When enemy carrier-based aircraft attacked the Japanese mainland on the 16th, one B-29 appeared several times before the large-scale air raid began. This time, carrier-based fighters were the main force, focusing their efforts on attacking Japanese air force bases, military facilities, and transportation lines, such as trains and ships. However, thanks to the perfect defense of the Japanese air force, the damage on all sides was minimal.

Tokyo, 16th (Central News Agency) – On the 15th, approximately sixty B-29 enemy aircraft came to bomb Nagoya, Shizuoka, and Mie prefectures. Japanese air defense units launched interception attacks. Investigation results showed that seventeen enemy aircraft were damaged, and one Japanese aircraft did not return.

### Philippine Operations: Enemy American Losses Heavy; Minister Matsushima Discusses the Pacific War Situation

The Japan Naval Fleet Press Department stationed in China, as usual, met with news reporters from various newspapers in the city yesterday (the 16th) at 3:00 PM. Minister Matsushima personally presided over the meeting and elaborated on the valiant fighting of the Japanese army in Manila and the difficulties faced by the enemy Americans in Pacific operations. A summary of his remarks is as follows:

Enemy Troops in Luzon Suffer Heavy Losses

Minister Matsushima first discussed the Philippine war situation, stating: Fierce battles are taking place in Manila, the Sierra Madre Mountains, and Banban on Luzon Island, with the most intense fighting occurring within Manila city. The enemy's 37th Division's 1st Cavalry Regiment advanced into the city from the north, but this unit has not been able to establish contact with the 11th Airborne Division and other units. The Japanese army and naval landing forces are intercepting the enemy on the south bank of the Pasig River, causing them to bleed. Regarding this difficult battle, the enemy has stated three reasons why their operations are difficult to progress: Due to the accuracy of Japanese artillery fire, mines are buried everywhere in the city, and they must protect Americans and foreign nationals, which greatly hinders their operations. The Japanese army frequently crosses the Pasig River to charge enemy positions, destroying their defenses and causing them great damage and fear. The current battleground for the final struggle in the Manila area is the Pasig River and the coastal area. The strong resistance of the Japanese army is causing heavy losses to the enemy Americans. The enemy admits that the losses suffered in the Philippine operations are unprecedented. From this, it can be seen that the enemy American losses in manpower and material resources are truly incalculable.

Difficulties Abound in Mainland Operations

The enemy American fleet's base in the Pacific has now been moved from Nimiz to Guam, and this will be used as a base for naval operations from now on. A portion of the air force has already bombed Iwo Jima and the Ogasawara Islands. The enemy has repeatedly revealed that the battle for Luzon Island is particularly difficult and that it will take time. From this, it is known that mainland operations in China cannot be realized for the time being, because their material preparations cannot be completed hastily. According to the New York Times on February 13, Chiang Kai-shek has agreed with the United States to launch a large-scale counterattack against the Japanese army in the coastal areas of China in the near future, but due to the fierce operations of the Japanese army last year, this counterattack plan has clearly become a bubble. If the American army wants to operate on the Chinese mainland, it will give the millions of Japanese troops who have been waiting for a long time a good opportunity to annihilate the enemy. Enemy American mainland operations are a very risky move. It is expected that before launching this plan, the American army will first occupy some small islands in the Pacific as a prelude to publicizing mainland operations.

Japanese Naval and Air Forces Await Opportunities to Fight

The Japanese navy's operations, no matter where the enemy comes from, always have a consistent policy. The Japanese navy's elite fleets and air forces are all waiting for opportunities to get close to the enemy. A United Press dispatch from the New York Times on the 15th quoted Colonel Matsushima as saying that the Japanese naval fleet will never avoid a direct confrontation with the American army. The Japanese navy's operational policy can be known from this.

Regarding the European war situation, the Soviets have already crossed the Warta River and made some progress. However, the German army is still very vigorous, fighting bravely and persistently. At the end of the last tripartite meeting of Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union, plans to dispose of Germany were discussed. After this news was released, the German people showed no signs of wavering, because their determination to fight is truly unwavering.

Chinese and Japanese Cooperate to Defend Shanghai

Recently, due to the movement of some Japanese soldiers and their families in Shanghai, some people seem to have a sense of unease. In fact, Shanghai is determined to defend itself to the death through the cooperation of both Chinese and Japanese forces to enhance combat power. Citizens really don't need to feel uneasy. We observe that some ignorant people in Shanghai are dreaming of waiting for the Americans to return. These people have forgotten China's past glory and its indelible history. After the Philippine war, the American army has poisoned the Filipinos three times, resulting in tragedies. The people of Shanghai who are waiting for the American army to arrive can take this as a warning. Recently, Chinese newspapers have published articles promoting the spirit of national self-determination and revitalizing the country, which is very gratifying. China and Japan must cooperate and become one to defend against aggression and protect the country, so that the people can obtain stability in their lives. Japan is determined to do its best to achieve this. It is reported that Chiang Kai-shek is currently ill and resting. It is hoped that he will think more about the future of East Asia and the welfare of the people on his sickbed, and express his intentions three times for the complete cooperation between China and Japan in the future, in order to realize the rebirth of East Asia.

I saw the joyful state of the young Chinese men and women in the city during the Lunar New Year, which I had never seen in the past, and I felt happy in my heart. In the past three days, the supply of electric lights, trams, and movies has been extended, allowing everyone to enjoy themselves. If the American army invades, these facts will become a dream. The highest responsibility of the citizens of a country is to protect their country and maintain and promote the welfare of the people. It is a big mistake for the people of Shanghai to think that the American army can come in this peaceful state. It must be known that if the American army operates on the mainland, it will be the first to suffer. Shanghai is the heartland of the Chinese and Japanese people, and it is also the heartland of a group of people from Chongqing or Yan'an. Therefore, it cannot be regarded as just an economic city of China. In order to protect this heartland, the Chinese and Japanese sides must cooperate and not hesitate to sacrifice themselves.

### Japanese Literature Patriotic Association Decides on This Year's Plan

Tokyo, 16th (Central News Agency) – The Japanese Literature Patriotic Association recently convened the second executive committee of the Greater East Asia Writers' Conference. Attendees included Chairman Yoshio Yoshimine, Yoshio Toyoshima, Jun Takami, Fumaki Tsuchiya, and Secretary-General Nakamura. Regarding the association's foundation, the following plans were formally decided: In order to build Greater East Asian culture, respect the classics, and further publish Japanese and foreign language translations of the Greater East Asia Classical Series, which penetrate Eastern classics and strengthen the spirit of morality, a translation team will be established within the secretariat. In order to fully utilize drama, a Greater East Asia Dramatists' Conference will be held in the fall of this year. To promote Greater East Asian culture, poets and writers will be exchanged between countries. Taking Sino-Japanese-Manchu friendship as an appropriate method of cultural exchange, a cultural alliance will be organized with Chinese poetry as the center. A Greater East Asia Academy of Arts will be established as a lively and orderly promotion mechanism for establishing Greater East Asian culture.

Editorial

### Deliberation and Management of Prices

The current price issue has undeniably transcended the economic sphere and become a major political difficulty. Although price fluctuations are inevitable during wartime, the lack of a proper regulated economy in our country has created an unprecedented surge in prices. This is of course due to other factors besides price management, but it is also undeniable that there has been no reasonable control over prices to date.

With this recent renewal of municipal personnel, the general public has high expectations for the stability of people's livelihoods in the rear during this crucial stage of the war. In order to achieve this goal, the economic authorities have not only reorganized the Price Deliberation Council, but have also revised its organizational regulations. This measure is indeed enough to refresh our minds. However, we believe that in this extraordinary period, in addition to considering market conditions and the cost of goods, the price assessment must also use the spirit of cutting through the chaos with a quick knife if it wants to clarify the current chaotic prices. Taking a certain major item as a benchmark, or taking the price on a certain day as a benchmark, as the basis for price limits, and stipulating that it will not be easily changed in the future. Otherwise, this deliberation and assessment may not be able to avoid repeating the mistakes of the past.

In this extraordinary period, any system or law that is not implemented vigorously and quickly will instead create a source of various malpractices. We cannot immediately say that there will be no oversights after the reforms. Therefore, in order to stabilize prices, it is necessary not only to assess their prices, but also to strictly manage them. In other words, any act of arbitrarily raising prices must be resolutely and severely punished. The market conditions of various goods in the city are mostly controlled by the various product markets. In the future, the economic security authorities must strive to rectify these sources of price increases. In particular, the organization and management of various industry associations should also be strengthened as soon as possible.

Yesterday, the Price Deliberation Council held a joint meeting of councilors and expert committees to decide on the cost and selling price of sixteen types of goods, and will submit opinions today. The Deliberation Committee will then make a final decision. Before long, new price limits will be decided for major commodities, and there is considerable expectation for stabilizing prices. However, based on past experience, price deliberation is entirely a passive task. If strict supervision and enforcement cannot be found, then price assessment is just a formality. Therefore, in the past, there have been many complaints about the competent authorities. In the future, it is hoped that deliberation, execution, and supervision will become unified, and that deliberation will become a prerequisite for managing prices. In this way, the deliberation work can be made proactive, and the entire price can achieve stable results.

### Gleanings from Nanhui

— Yifei

When this reporter left Nanhui two months ago, the county government was slightly using the people's land to build roads in order to develop transportation, prosper the market, and circulate materials between urban and rural areas. This measure is essential for the current environment and contributes greatly to wartime defense. From a broad perspective, although farmers will suffer some losses due to the slight separation of land, it is not too critical.

Road Construction

Unexpectedly, of the six major trunk lines planned in the past, which were vigorously promoted at the time with a deadline for completion, only a few sections have been completed to date: the Huangjia Road to Laogang section in the first district, the Jiangzhen to Lujia Road section in the second district, and the Dawei to Pengqi Temple section in the eighth district. The remaining lines, such as the Zhuhqiao to Zhoupu, Yuqiao to Tangqiao, and Beicai to Chuansha trunk lines, have all been suspended. The completed sections have not been used for traffic and have been left to naturally collapse. The reason for this is that the rivers and waterways in Nanhui are crisscrossed, requiring a large amount of bridge construction materials. In this extraordinary period of material conservation, there are difficulties, leading to the suspension of construction. It is deeply hoped that the county authorities will find a way to complete the entire project as soon as possible, so as to avoid wasting previous efforts.

In addition to the trucks of the Shanghai-Nanhui Long-Distance Bus Company on the Zhoupu to Dajuan section, only small cars of the East Asia Company operate on the current routes. The former only has one bus a day, and due to the small number of vehicles and frequent use, there are often breakdowns, which are not enough to meet the huge needs. The latter has expensive fares, which are staggering. From Dongchang Road to Zhoupu, it has reached two thousand gold, and from Dongchang Road directly to Dajuan, it costs ten thousand gold per person. At such fares, ordinary people cannot afford to inquire. It is deeply hoped that when all the roads are completed in the future, the authorities will be able to organize a sound transportation agency on their own, and the fares will be affordable to the public, so that farmers who are fulfilling their obligations can also enjoy a thing or two.

Cooperative Undertakings

The Nanhui Cooperative Branch is managed by the "Cooperative Undertakings Committee of the Executive Yuan" and is subject to the "Shanghai Regional Liaison Office" of the Committee. It was established on September 1, 1943. Currently, there are 41,430 members, and the society's funds are 4.2 million yuan. Members pay a fund of 60 yuan per household, and a deposit of 20 yuan. The first society was He Li Yijhen, who resigned immediately, and was succeeded by Wang Xiuxian, who had previously served as the district chief of the area. However, as things were just starting out, and because 90% of the members were farmers who lacked knowledge of cooperative undertakings and were mostly uninterested, most of them joined under the coercion of township leaders, and after the fact, they did not ask about the society's affairs. (One aspect is also due to intelligence.) Also, the villagers originally hoped that after joining, they could get cheap rationed goods, but in fact, it was difficult to fulfill their wishes, and the villagers felt disappointed. The society's own expenses were huge, and they did not know how to use the funds for production costs, resulting in a situation of sitting and eating empty mountains. When this reporter arrived in Nancheng in early October of last year, I went to the society to investigate and saw that the society's affairs were at a standstill and no one was in charge. Later, the local gentry Zhang Shihua took over, but due to the heavy difficulties, it was not easy to start, and he resigned after only a month or so.

It is learned that the society held a members' representative meeting on November 29 of last year, with a total of 36 representatives present, with only 8 absent. At that time, members were sent by various agencies to attend and supervise the reorganization. The local gentry Ye Bingwei was selected on the spot to serve as the chairman and president, and the branch was moved to Zhoupu Township. The society's "Nanhui City Township Branch Office" was established in Nanhui City. What this reporter hopes for today is:

Increase Capital

The society's original funds were almost exhausted when they were handed over, leaving only 500,000 gold, only 1/9 of the original amount. This meager amount is really difficult to do anything with. Farmers should be earnestly persuaded to introduce friends and relatives to join the society in order to increase its strength. At the same time, incentive measures should also be established for old members, and they should be encouraged to increase their original funds. Strive for Allocations Although the society's allocation has been more than half a year since it began, the actual allocation has only been five times, and the quantity is minimal, which is like a drop in the bucket and does not help. The number and quantity of allocations should be increased to encourage them. Run Agricultural Loans At present, the rural economy is exhausted, and the cooperative strives to handle agricultural loans, providing farmers with plows, cattle, seeds, etc. Other activities such as establishing experimental fields, running "mutual aid societies", and promoting group living, etc. If all these are held one by one, then the Nanhui Cooperative Undertaking, which was on the verge of dying in the past, will surely have a day of revival, and the future cannot be limited.

The Year's Scenery is Desolate

Today's rural merchants still take the end of the lunar year as the settlement period. In previous years, the town purchased New Year's goods, and the market was prosperous. This year, it is far less than in the past. In addition to the five ocean general merchandise stores being sparsely populated, the southern goods stores also have dwindling customers. From this, we can reflect the exhaustion of the rural economy and the thinness of the public's purchasing power.

### Japanese Army Implements "Charging" Warfare on Luzon Island; Enemy Heavily Damaged in Southern Manila

Luzon Front Line, 15th (Central News Agency) – The enemy's overall force on the Luzon war front is focused on the capture of Manila. This was originally MacArthur's plan. Judging by the enemy's landing of weapons and ammunition in Lingayen and San Fabian, the center of the Manila battlefield is still the area on the south side of the Pasig River running through the city center and the old city area. These areas are still under the control of the Japanese army. The enemy troops invading the Katipunan area gradually increased their forces. On the 11th, they attacked with tanks and 30 infantrymen. One part of them went straight to the Kungjili area, and the other part attacked the Pigen area. At that time, the elite Japanese army and navy in the west of Majili and the Nicolas airfield immediately launched interception attacks. A part of the enemy troops invaded the Pa-on in the southern part of Manila late on the 11th and were heavily damaged by the Japanese army's commando attacks until the morning of the next day. Around 1:00 AM on the 12th, the enemy shelled Majili, and it did not stop until the 13th, but the Japanese army defending the area did not waver. Repeated bayonet battles were launched near Bangke, and fierce fighting was in full swing between the two sides. The enemy troops who invaded the vicinity of the Nicholas airfield were also attacked and repelled. The battles in the Clarkfield area were extremely fierce. Since the 9th, the enemy has first used artillery fire to cover, followed by dozens of tanks as the vanguard, and repeatedly attacked the Japanese army's central position. Therefore, the Japanese army's right wing retreated to the second line of defense, but the Japanese army in the center still firmly defended the first line of defense. The enemy troops in this area suffered heavy losses. The British 30th Division suffered heavy casualties due to the repeated fierce attacks of the Japanese army. Currently, there is no major change in the front of Lingayen. The enemy's naval bombardment is intermittent. Only the enemy troops near San Jose are relatively active. Taking advantage of the enemy's slow offensive, the Japanese army has been implementing charging tactics day and night. In terms of the battle results from the 8th to the 11th alone, more than 1,500 enemy soldiers have been killed or wounded. In addition, 4 enemy tanks, 8 artillery pieces, 30 mortars, a large number of machine guns, more than 30 trucks, 35 tents, and 11 military supply warehouses have been destroyed. At the same time, 10,000 rounds of various bullets, 10 mortars, 3 rapid-fire guns, 5 heavy machine guns, 25 light machine guns, automatic rifles, and telephones were intercepted.

### Central Senate of Java Increases Number of Senators

This arrangement is different from the previous increases in that the new senators include all Arab, Minadoan, and Dutch mixed-race ethnic groups, with the intention of uniting Indonesia and striving for independence, so that the total strength of all ethnic groups can expand the scope of participation in government.

### Chongqing American Aircraft Attack Kyoto; Three Shot Down

Nanjing, 16th (Central News Agency) – Three Chongqing American Air Force P-51 aircraft invaded the capital's airspace at 1:53 PM on the 16th.

### Pacific War Front: Isolated Japanese Units Active, Tenaciously Holding Positions, Causing Deep Terror to American Forces

Regarding the "clear and courageous fighting" of the Japanese garrison in Rabaul, the Japanese side has long announced it. Recently, a Swedish newspaper published a dispatch from a New York correspondent about the "isolated units" of the Japanese and German armies in the Pacific and European war zones. The article was almost entirely about the Japanese isolated forces in the Pacific. Excerpts are translated below:

Hindering American Forces: Whether in the Pacific or Europe, behind the anti-Axis battle lines, there are still Japanese or German troops in isolated and unsupported situations, securing important positions and adopting strong defensive postures. These troops show no signs of surrender. Although they are isolated, their importance is not only remembered by their comrades but also by their enemies. The American forces continue to attack them from the sea and air. In other words, to prevent these units from participating in major battlefields, the United States must use considerable force to guard against them. This fact shows the value of these isolated units. Even today, it is still necessary to continue to attack them repeatedly. The American forces have recently experienced this. The Japanese troops in Rabaul have not only repaired their bombed airfields but also repaired the damaged aircraft, launching retaliatory bombings against nearby American bases. These Japanese garrisons have been in constant radio contact with Tokyo, and sometimes they use boats and other means to break through the blockade. Relying on boat supplies, they can obtain various supplies, such as medicines, compressed food, ammunition, etc. They can almost all get sufficient ammunition supplies.

Self-Sufficiency in Food

The Japanese garrison on a certain island suffers from a severe shortage of food because the island is almost entirely barren land with very little arable land, so it cannot produce enough food. However, the garrisons on other islands, especially the Japanese troops in Bougainville and New Guinea, have begun large-scale farming with the belief that they can be self-sufficient in food. American planes often spread poison in these cultivated areas, using various methods to hinder them. Among these isolated units, the Rabaul garrison is particularly outstanding, possessing a large amount of ammunition. In addition, the coastal area of New Guinea is still in the hands of the military, and they show no signs of willingly surrendering. When will the Australian army dare to launch a sweeping battle in that area? It is unknown. The Australian army says that temporarily leaving them alone will not pose a great danger, which actually shows the Australian army's terror. Australian Army Commander Blamey described the situation of these isolated Japanese troops: "From New Guinea to the Solomon Islands, Japanese troops in various places have begun to plant rice in a vast area and have begun to raise livestock."

The anti-Axis forces must always be vigilant against the Japanese troops scattered in the vast areas behind their battle lines. Why? Because if they are not careful, these isolated units will complete their self-sufficiency and gradually regain their offensive power, which will be troublesome. The anti-Axis forces have had practical experience in the past. If the East Indies are also isolated, the monitoring problem will be even more difficult. (Special dispatch from Stockholm on the 28th. Translated from the Daily News, January 30th)

Beijing, 15th (Central News Agency) - The newly appointed Chairman of the North China Political Council, Mr. Wang Yintai, held an inauguration ceremony at 11:00 AM on the 15th in the conference room of the Foreign Affairs Building of the North China Political Council, and announced the following governance policies: Based on the principles of national supremacy and victory first, unite from top to bottom and move towards the path of building a new nation. Strengthen the political system of cooperation between officials and civilians, strive to protect the country and the people, and promote production. Implement sound politics vigorously.

### America Actively Erodes Chongqing's Military Sovereignty

Forward Base in Guangxi, 16th (Central News Agency) - Since the Xianggui Campaign, the American military's erosion of Chongqing's military affairs and sovereignty has become increasingly blatant. According to recent intelligence, the American military has decided to set up a chief liaison officer of American officers in the newly established Southwest Army and Air Force Headquarters. At the same time, several American liaison officers will be stationed in the new headquarters of Tang Enbo, the commander-in-chief of the Fourth War Zone of the Expeditionary Force in Burma in the Guixiang Border Area, and the new headquarters of Lu Han, the commander-in-chief of the Yuebian Border Area, as well as the headquarters at all levels under their jurisdiction. The task of these liaison officers is to serve as instructors during garrison and to engage in liaison tasks during rotations. On the Chongqing side, one liaison officer is also sent to the American Rear Headquarters and the American Air Force Headquarters, whose business is only in the military finance. Although in the past there were American officers who served as instructors for Chongqing's military operations, there has never been such a large-scale deployment. Although this can be called communication and educational guidance, and reciprocal exchange of liaison officers, it is actually an activation of the American military's erosion of Chongqing's autonomous power, all of which is based on the American military's unilateral actions. According to a staff officer captured during the last Xianggui Campaign, Chiang Kai-shek is quite wary of the American military's erosion of Chongqing's autonomous power.

### Goebbels Encourages Germans to Fight for Survival, People's Assault Teams Set Out Enthusiastically

Berlin, 16th (Central News Agency) - German News Agency: Goebbels wrote an article in the German Weekly entitled "Our Opportunities," saying, "The most terrible war is better than the peace that the enemy forces us to accept, and it is easier to endure. The publication of the war situation is still uncertain, and it must wait until one of the belligerent countries puts down its weapons before it can be determined. As for which side puts down its weapons, it all depends on us. The enemy today certainly has greater operational potential, but it is only material, not spiritual. The enemy does not have a combat goal worth fighting for and worth dying for, but we do. We are fighting to protect the right to live. A country that is determined to fight to protect its existence cannot be conquered. This is our clear opportunity to win victory. Our only savior is courage. Courage will not only gain glory, but also gain victory."

Berlin, 16th (Central News Agency) - A reporter passed by the Olympic Games field last night and saw many people gathered there, but they were not athletes, but people's assault teams. Because it was dark, it was impossible to find out. Soon after the "Peace Bell" of the Olympic Bell Tower rang, several teams of people's assault teams were seen setting out enthusiastically from the rear of the competition field to the front line. The cheers were no less than when the athletes from the United States, France, Finland, and other countries entered the field in 1936. Yesterday, I saw a special team of the people's assault team departing from the competition field in a large military vehicle, and saw that the people's assault team's assault vehicle team carried many assault vehicle guns. The front line has been forced near Berlin, so there was no military band playing when cheering. Berlin's defense is becoming more and more tense, and street roads have been built with defensive works.

### Impressions of Wartime Berlin

Tokyo, 15th (Central News Agency) - According to a special dispatch from the Swedish capital of the "Mainichi Shimbun" here: The Swedish reporter of Dagens Nyheter in Berlin wrote an article on the 10th entitled "War Clouds - Brandenburg at War," reporting on the situation of the Berlin eastern front that he witnessed as follows: We obtained special permission from the German military authorities and arrived at the front line only ten kilometers away from Berlin by car. The impression of what we saw and heard was extremely profound. The German officers who guarded the important strategic locations of bridges and highways posted red signals and ordered us to stop. We showed our passes and obtained their permission to move forward safely. Along the way, we saw German troops engaging in various tasks such as setting up trenches, erecting power lines, and setting up headquarters. In order to prevent the Soviet army from attacking, most of the engineers were doing their best to lay landmines. Various kinds of military vehicles were driving on the highway, most of which were large trucks, winding like long snakes. The full loads slowly came from the east, and the empty boxes hurried west, transporting back and forth endlessly. Soldiers holding military shovels were burying themselves in building positions and fortresses. A large number of Red Army prisoners marched westward in rows from the old prisoner of war camp to the new place. Their mood seemed extremely comfortable, and there was no sign of hesitation or anxiety. The reporters waited until the town not far from the iron field, and it was already bright. The German citizens in the town had not yet evacuated, and refugees passed through in batches with their families as units, transported by horse-drawn carts. The carts were full of fodder, etc., and the address and name were posted on the side of the cart. It can be inferred from this where the Soviet army has arrived. Although they came from a long way, no one was unhappy. When talking about the farms that were sufficient to stay in the Soviet Union, they were silent and did not cry, only revealing an expression of homelessness, no less than the situation of being blindly bombed by enemy planes in the past. A certain young girl said resolutely, "Sooner or later, we will be able to return to our homeland," as the carriage moved forward. In a small courtyard beside a lake near the road, there were four young soldiers sitting and talking about the situation. In order to find out their discussion, the reporters also joined the chat. Unexpectedly, from the tone of their conversation, it was enough to represent the general will of the nation's thinking. They unanimously meant that we would never give up the war, nor would we surrender. No matter how long the war is prolonged, we will never be afraid. No matter how the enemy attacks, the German people will never take the path of suicide. One of them said that if Berlin falls, we are still fighting behind Berlin. Our only slogan is unconditional resistance.

### No Significant Changes in the Western Front

Berlin, 16th (Central News Agency) - According to Huitong News Agency from responsible sources: The Western front was extremely sluggish the day before yesterday. The anti-Axis forces have weakened their offensive power due to the losses they have suffered in the past few days. The focus of the battle is between the Meuse and the Waal and the Saar area. The battle in the Pötschem area has been greatly weakened, and there are only local battles in the Alsace area. The British and Canadian forces launched another offensive between Emerich and Gennep. The Canadian army advanced along the highway from Cleve to Mehrum, Goch, and Calcar. The British army wanted to advance between the Reichswald Forest and Kleve, but made no progress. To the east and south of the Reichswald Forest, the gap broken by the British tank spearhead was recovered by the German counterattack. The British attempt to expand the bridgehead of the Niers River resulted in heavy losses. After the German army took water release measures on the Roer front, the anti-Axis forces were not very active. The anti-Axis forces are now reorganizing their troops there, and German artillery is concentrating on bombing them. The American army's attempt to expand the bridgehead on the Saar front also suffered heavy losses. The German military continued to engage in defensive battles in the city of Pötschem, repeatedly attacking the American troops who had entered the city. The anti-Axis forces made progress of several hundred meters on the Echternach-Bitburg highway. The American army launched a very small force in Lower Alsace to attack Hagenau and Woerth and was defeated by German artillery fire.

### Soviet Army in Silesia Adopts Encirclement Strategy, Fighting Extends to the Queis River Area

Silesian Front, 16th (Central News Agency) - Huitong News Agency: The fighting in Lower Silesia is becoming more and more intense. The Soviet army seems to have an encirclement attempt, penetrating deeply through gaps, occupying towns and strongholds, and forming encirclement pockets. The German army adopts elastic tactics, retreating in time and inflicting heavy losses on the Soviet army. The Soviet army seems to be willing to sacrifice, attacking in the Queis area and near the Breslau-Berlin highway. The Soviet vanguard has crossed the river at Neumarkt and Rothflößchen, and the Sprottau area is also in fierce fighting. Sagan is still in German hands. North of Sagan, the Soviet army crossed the Bober River and attacked Schmottseifen fiercely. The Soviet army entered Neusalz in three routes and was repelled, losing half of its tanks.

Berlin, 16th (Central News Agency) - According to front-line news: The German tank units attacked the flank of Konev's army in the Sagan area, and the powerful vanguard of the Soviet army, which attempted to advance westward with mechanized units, was mostly annihilated in the Sorau area. However, Konev's army in the Silesian region advanced further north to Guben, so that it made contact with the left wing of Zhukov's army. In addition, the Soviet army in the middle reaches of the Warta River has not succeeded in expanding its existing crossing points and new crossings. From a general point of view, the entire line from north of Grünberg to Küstrin is now in the preparation stage for battle.

### Reactions to the Yalta Conference from All Sides

Berlin, 16th (Central News Agency) - According to German political reports: Judging from the comments of Britain and the United States after the publication of the Yalta Conference communiqué, it is known that Britain and the United States have also recognized Stalin as the only winner in this meeting. The Americans felt somewhat disappointed that the communiqué did not mention the Pacific War. de Gaulle was flattered by the provision in the communiqué allowing France to participate in the implementation of the Yalta Conference resolutions, but on the one hand, he was troubled by the fait accompli. The Polish government in exile was the most opposed country, while another victim, Yugoslavia, expressed its willingness to accept the sacrifice. As for Germany, the Yalta Conference can prove that Roosevelt and Churchill were no match for Stalin, and the new world advocated by the anti-Axis countries is not better than the old world. If the Yalta resolutions are implemented, the social system and way of life of Britain and the United States cannot be applied to the European continent, and the impoverished Europe is not a guarantee of world peace.

The Polish Question

Stockholm, Sweden, 16th (Central News Agency) - According to a London dispatch: It was later clarified on the details of the Crimean talks that President Roosevelt advocated that at least Lviv should be included in the new territory of Poland on the issue of delimiting the Soviet-Polish border line of the Curzon Line, while Chairman Stalin always insisted that it should belong to the Soviet Union. It was announced that the results of the talks were expected to be at least a favorable solution for Poland in the southern part of the Curzon Line. Due to Chairman Stalin's insistence on Lviv, it has been decided to cede it to the Soviet Union.

Stockholm, Sweden, 16th (Central News Agency) - According to a London dispatch: The Polish Prime Minister in exile met with a group of reporters on the 15th and expressed his views on the Crimean Conference communiqué as follows: The decision of the Crimean Conference was a major blow to Polish sovereignty. The Polish people were convinced that no Pole residing in London would merge with the Lublin government on the issue of the Allies' re-partitioning of Polish territory and enslaving it. Chairman Stalin chanted democracy, but in fact the Polish people did not trust the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union only plundered Poland and fell into starvation.

### The United States Plans to Participate in the Development of the Eastern Soviet Union

Stockholm, Sweden, 16th (Central News Agency) - According to German News Agency, the Svenska Dagbladet correspondent in London said: Qualified sources in Washington are now discussing the plan for the United States to participate in the economic development of Siberia, Eastern Russia, and Central Asia. The United States will not only supply machinery, but also purchase its goods. The Soviet government is now conducting negotiations with American businessmen to order heavy industrial machinery and other industrial equipment worth hundreds of millions of dollars. A certain American shipyard has discussed with the Soviet Union the construction of a fleet of merchant ships, and other American businessmen also expect to avoid cold houses. The United States learned that the Soviet Union actually wanted to develop Eastern Russia and Siberia, from the Ural Mountains to the Pacific Ocean. During the war, the Soviet Union's heavy industry was moved to the east, and Siberia was also colonized by Soviet people who escaped from western Soviet Union. This development will continue after the war.

### British House of Commons Debates the Atlantic Charter

Stockholm, Sweden, 16th (Central News Agency) - Huitong News Agency: The British House of Commons discussed the Atlantic Charter last night. Sir William Williams, a Conservative MP, asked whether the Atlantic Charter applied to the Baltic countries. Deputy Prime Minister Attlee refused to answer. Labour MP Sorenson asked why there was no explanation that the Atlantic Charter did not apply to certain countries when it was signed. Attlee replied that the Atlantic Charter could not apply to the enemies of the anti-Axis countries.

### The Truth About the U.S. Marine Corps

— Zi Ming

In the southwestern Pacific, amidst calls for a general counteroffensive by the United States, the battles have become increasingly fierce. Relying on their massive material resources, they attempt to advance island by island. Ignoring the loss of aircraft carriers, they anxiously prepare for amphibious landings. The Marine Corps is at the forefront of these landing operations. From the landings on Guadalcanal, New Georgia, and Bougainville, to the unprecedented losses suffered in the landings on Makin and Tarawa, and the recent landings on Leyte, Mindoro, and Luzon, the U.S. Marine Corps has always been the vanguard. What kind of force is this Marine Corps, which has become a sacrificial lamb of American imperialism? A brief account is provided below.

The U.S. Marine Corps was established on July 1, 1798. It is said that the founder was John Paul Jones, the "Father of the American Navy." During the War of Independence in 1779, he once used the Bonhomme Richard to destroy the British warship Serapis. From then on, the United States began to have a navy to confront Britain. The headquarters of the U.S. Marine Corps was initially located in Philadelphia, and moved to Washington in 1800, where it remains today.

Subsequently, the U.S. Marine Corps participated in the War of 1812 and the Civil War. In the Spanish-American War, to secure a harbor as a base for the U.S. fleet, they landed at Guantanamo Bay in Cuba, providing the navy with an advanced base. The U.S. Navy deeply felt the necessity of having troops accompanying the fleet. During World War I, in addition to ensuring supply lines and guarding harbor bases, they also engaged in joint operations with the army, exceeding the original mission of the Marine Corps, but they were able to demonstrate their capabilities. Furthermore, in the latter half of the 19th century and the 20th century, due to economic and political instability in Western and Central America, and China, there was a need to protect the lives and property of American citizens. The Marine Corps was dispatched abroad, and thus the Marine Corps was repeatedly used as a tool of American imperialist policy.

The Establishment of the U.S. Marine Corps

Good examples include the organized assistance to the Cuban revolt in 1895, the Marine Corps' support during the Hawaiian revolt in 1893 and the subsequent annexation of Hawaii, and the intervention in Nicaragua in the early 20th century.

In short, the U.S. Marine Corps was established for the sake of aggression. The United States faces no threat of invasion from other countries, but since the Spanish-American War, the United States has engaged in numerous wars of the strong preying on the weak. And the vanguard in each of these wars has been the Marine Corps. The reason for organizing this amphibious force, which is neither navy nor army, is that during landing operations, army troops are not accustomed to landing operations, and may suffer from seasickness during transport, making it impossible for them to engage in fierce combat immediately after landing. In such cases, it is much more appropriate to have troops accustomed to marine life undertake the tasks of the army. The Marine Corps was established based on this viewpoint. Furthermore, from the point of view of operational command, it can be said that it is extremely useful for a fleet, in other words, the navy, to have such a directly subordinate land combat force.

The central organ of the U.S. Marine Corps stipulates: "The Marine Corps is a unit of the Navy and must abide by naval laws and regulations. However, the Marine Corps Headquarters is different from other bureaus of the Navy Department and is not a component of the Navy Department. It is a type of army organization suitable for naval conditions, and is subordinate to the Secretary of the Navy, who exercises the powers of the President." It also stipulates that the title of its commander is Major General Commandant, with headquarters in Washington. As for the general capabilities and military discipline of the Corps, he is responsible to the Secretary of the Navy.

Furthermore, the term of office of the Marine Corps commander is four years, appointed by the President. The current U.S. Marine Corps Commander is Lieutenant General Vandegrift, who commanded the landings on Guadalcanal in the Solomon Islands in August of the previous year, the landings on New Georgia in June of last year, and the landings on Bougainville. From this point, it can be inferred that the United States will greatly utilize his operational experience in the Solomon Islands to facilitate the future counteroffensive operations in the Pacific.

Difficulty in Replenishing Officers

The number of personnel in the Marine Corps has been codified based on the Advancement Regulations of June 23, 1938. In peacetime, the number of non-commissioned officers and enlisted personnel in the Marine Corps is stipulated to be 20% of the regular naval force, and the number of officers is 5.5% of the statutory number of non-commissioned officers in the Marine Corps. When World War II broke out, the peacetime statutory number of 1,521 officers and 27,497 enlisted personnel, or 39,400 in an emergency, was increased to 2,552 officers and 46,400 enlisted personnel, or 60,000 in an emergency. When the Greater East Asia War broke out, it was further increased. According to the U.S. Secretary of the Navy, the total force reached 100,000 in February 1942, and was expected to double to 200,000 in 1942, and 440,000 by the end of the same year.

Marine Corps officers are graduates of naval officer schools, meritorious Marine Corps warrant officers, or are selected from civilians and are of better quality. However, since the outbreak of World War II, due to the rapid expansion of Marine Corps personnel, it has been particularly difficult to replenish officers.

Since the beginning of the Greater East Asia War, after the defeat at Pearl Harbor, the U.S. Marine Corps has been conducting large-scale recruitment propaganda under the slogan "Remember Pearl Harbor," and has also recruited black volunteers. Therefore, by October 2, 1942, the total force had reached 200,000. However, due to the subsequent expansion of armaments and the urgent need for personnel in the defense industry, and the army's implementation of conscription, it was still difficult to recruit large numbers of personnel despite the authorities' efforts to promote recruitment. This is evident from the statement by the U.S. War Manpower Commission on January 12, 1943, that the Navy could also apply the conscription law.

Based on the nature of its assigned tasks, the Marine Corps is divided into Fleet Marine Force, shipboard detachments, and defense forces. Among them, the Fleet Marine Force is an expeditionary force, responsible for occupying or defending forward bases for the air force or navy. Its organizational structure at the time of the outbreak of war, in addition to the 1st Marine Division in Quantico and the 2nd Marine Division in San Diego, also includes seven defense battalions and two air wings. The 1st Marine Division belongs to the Atlantic Fleet, and the 2nd Marine Division is attached to the Pacific Fleet. In September 1941, learning from the lessons of World War II, and to ensure close integration of the navy and air force, amphibious units consisting of Marine divisions, air wings, and army units were created.

Weapons for Landing

The commander of the Pacific Amphibious Force at the time of its creation was Major General Clayton B. Vogel, the predecessor of Lieutenant General Vandegrift. Its headquarters was located in San Diego, and it was composed of the 2nd Marine Division, the 2nd Marine Air Wing, and the 3rd Marine Division, under the command of the Commander of the Pacific Fleet. Its transportation and escort were also handled by the Pacific Fleet, and included high-speed transport squadrons. The organizational structure of the Atlantic Amphibious Force was similar, and the commander was Major General Holland Smith, with headquarters in Quantico.

A brief description of the amphibious tanks and boats used by these amphibious forces is provided below. The U.S. amphibious tanks include the Sea Jeep (small, carrying eight people), the Alligator (large, carrying 60 people), and the DUKW (large, carrying 50 people), all equipped with 7.7mm machine guns and 12.7mm machine guns, and some are equipped with larger caliber machine guns.

As for landing boats, there are use-type boats (carrying eight to ten armed personnel, speed 14 to 15 knots), A-type 36-foot boats (carrying 40 armed personnel, speed 12 knots), B-type 40-foot boats (carrying 50 armed personnel, speed 8 to 10 knots), B-type 75-foot boats (carrying 75 armed personnel, speed 8 to 10 knots), and war transport ships, artillery transport ships, etc.

In addition, these amphibious forces also have parachute troops, barrage balloon squadrons, and glider troops, etc., using mobility to rapidly seize enemy strongholds, kill enemy soldiers, and rapidly and thoroughly destroy various facilities in surprise attacks.

Next are the shipboard detachments, which are stationed on battleships (75 to 85 personnel) and light cruisers (55 to 65 personnel), serving as guards on the ship and as gunners on the side of the ship during combat.

As for the defense forces, they are responsible for defending naval fleets and air bases. Since the outbreak of the war, the value of naval bases has increased, and efforts have been made to modernize and mechanize them. The organizational structure of a base defense anti-aircraft battalion included in the defense forces is as follows: three 3-inch anti-aircraft gun companies (12 guns), one 12.7mm anti-aircraft machine gun company (48 guns), and one searchlight and sound detector company (six searchlights and sound detectors each).

U.S. Marine Corps Tactics

As mentioned above, the battlefield of the Marine Corps is both land and sea, so they not only know how to operate various landing boats, but also perform the duties of infantry and artillery after landing, carrying machine guns, flamethrowers, tanks, and artillery. Among them, the Marine Corps has all the artillery that the army has. They have various modern scientific weapons, and of course, the Marine Corps also has airplanes. During landing, they not only deploy their own aircraft, but also use aircraft carriers to carry out operations in the air. The U.S. Marine Corps also has parachute training, but has not carried out large-scale operations, and has only used a small number of parachute troops in New Guinea and Choiseul Island.

They often stand at the forefront of aggression, and have undergone rigorous training on both land and sea for a long time. Their quality and skills are indeed superior to those of land and naval soldiers. However, since landing on Guadalcanal, they have been beaten by the Japanese army and know that they cannot fight with equal forces. Therefore, they often use several to more than ten times the force to attack.

As for their mode of operation, since New Georgia, they have emphasized thorough artillery bombardment, even completely destroying the land's forests. Otherwise, they land on coasts without Japanese troops and quickly build airfields to gain air supremacy. As for islands like Makin and Tarawa that are not suitable for building airfields, they carry out landings after dropping large iron nets.

They have thorough preparation and training when landing. For example, the detachments that landed on Attu Island were trained for island battles, and the detachments that landed on the southern islands received special training in Australian jungle warfare.

However, it is asked how the Japanese army, which is elite and unparalleled, will thoroughly defeat this Marine Corps, which is the claw of aggression, no matter how it is trained, equipped, or how large its forces are.

### Security Command Refuses Anonymous Accusations

The city's Security Command has recently received a series of anonymous accusations. After thorough investigation, most of them involve fabricating facts to file false charges and achieve personal gain. It has been learned that in the future, anyone who reports or accuses military law cases to the command must provide a formal petition with details such as name, age, place of origin, and address, sign and seal it, and obtain a shop guarantee. Those using group names must affix the group seal, indicate the location of the group, and have the representative sign and seal it, indicating their age, place of origin, and address, before it will be accepted in accordance with the law. The name of the person reporting will be kept strictly confidential. Anonymous accusations will not be accepted. Citizens are requested to take note.

### Police Bureau Punishes Profiteering Merchants

Since the sudden surge in prices of grain, vegetables, firewood, charcoal, and other items during the Lunar New Year holiday, it has posed a major threat to the lives of citizens. Therefore, it is hoped that the authorities will quickly take effective measures to sell and adjust prices. The Economic Security Section of the Fourth Department of the Municipal Police Bureau and the Economic Police Team have been conducting strict crackdowns on price increases of food-related items since the 7th until the 12th, and have achieved great results in stabilizing prices. The trend of prices is now being closely monitored. The section and team, with about 100 members, formed a special inspection team. With the cooperation of representatives from related agencies and trade associations, they went to small shops and markets until the 12th to conduct strict investigations on all prices. As a result, [blank] reported two stores exceeding the price limit in the fuel sector, one coal briquette store, and one firewood store. In the food sector, a total of 660 merchants who illegally raised prices, including vegetable vendors and meat shops, were found. Since most of the food merchants are small-scale businesses, the violations were relatively minor. Among the profiteering merchants reported, 360 were fined, 269 were detained, and 30 were given verbal warnings. Fuel merchants were actively manipulating and hoarding, which was extremely egregious. The police bureau has decided to impose severe penalties after the investigation is completed. Furthermore, the police bureau reported that nearly 700 violations were reported in just seven days, which proves that profiteering merchants are manipulating and hoarding to an extreme degree. Therefore, great importance is being attached to this issue. It has been made clear that even more severe punishments will be taken against future violators, and strict surveillance will continue.

### Rectification of Changning Road Police Station: Extortion at the Train Station

Extortion of travelers at the train station and the selling of black market tickets have become widespread, making it difficult to eradicate in a short period. Currently, Yao Benyuan, the chief of the Changning Road Police Station, who has been in office for just over a week, is actively carrying out the rectification of police affairs. It has been learned that the extortion and illicit sales by officials and police officers at the West Train Station have not ceased. Yesterday, an order was issued to withdraw the entire team back to the branch station for investigation. It is heard that, for the sake of caution, the deputy chief of the branch station first selected seven police officers of good character and integrity. All officers and police were gathered, and assignments were determined by public lottery. Furthermore, Mr. Man Xijiu, the chief police officer of the Third Inspectorate District, was invited to the site to oversee the proceedings. Chen Junqing was selected to take over the defense. It is said that he must personally sign a pledge never to [lacuna] violate regulations, and that any insubordination will be punished according to wartime special military law.

### Financial Bureau Penalizes Four Theaters for Violations

Since Mr. Luo, concurrently the director, took office at the Municipal Finance Bureau, he has vigorously rectified tax collection. In addition to dispatching staff to investigate day and night, it is learned that the chief of the license section and the head of the entertainment tax division also personally visited various entertainment venues on the 13th and 14th of this month. The Shanghai Opera Theater, the International Grand Theater, the Golden Country Grand Theater, and the Hongbin Theater were found to have violated military regulations. Penalties have been imposed based on the severity of the offenses.

### Route 1 Tram Not Yet Restored

The red banner of the "Relief for Out-of-School Charity Bazaar" fluttered in the wind. A quarter of an hour before the opening, the enthusiastic crowd was already launching an offensive. Although the gate guards put up a strong resistance, they finally yielded. The crowd surged in, so densely packed that even the quaint advertisements along the [lacuna] building could not be appreciated. It was difficult to ascend to the second floor. What a dazzling spectacle! What a bustling city temple! The painting and calligraphy hall on the left had been transformed into a commercial district. Half of Jiaotong University was a munitions factory. Various gliders, airplanes, warships, etc., meticulously crafted, were on display, reflecting the spirit of the premier mechanical engineering department. Although the scale of Nie Zhongcheng was small, the shouts of the shop assistants added much to the atmosphere. The enthusiasm of Hujiang University had long been renowned. This time, in addition to a large-scale charity sale of ABC candies and CPC coffee, they also produced their own ink and peanut candy. The dining hall that they operated the day before and that John took over yesterday can be considered the most moving contribution to the entire city market. Daily turnover exceeded 200,000, and it was fully occupied from noon onwards. Beautiful female students busily prepared food and served customers. Over twenty kinds of Chinese and Western delicacies were highly praised, and the accompaniment of a splendid orchestra added to the enchantment. At the top of the stairs to the third floor, a sign read, "Hurry! Go up and see the tuberculosis germs fight!" It turned out that the third floor housed the clinics of Tongde and John, each with sections for specimens, examinations, and charity sales. Young doctors explained things in detail and provided services such as heart and lung examinations and blood tests. Descending again to the second floor and entering the market transformed from the library, the High School Affiliated to Shanghai University took the lead and trade was booming. The goods from the Southern Model High School were exquisite, and there were also animal displays. Fudan University was filled with tobacco. Yesterday morning, a concert was held in the auditorium. Mingde's displays were ingenious, Datong mainly sold food and used a gramophone to attract customers, and Qixiu made a variety of pastries. Puppet shows were performed in front of the auditorium in the afternoon, with two acts conveying [lacuna] profound meaning and captivating the audience. The night before, a drama and pantomime were performed to excellent effect, and yesterday afternoon, a comedy was also performed. The gymnasium on the ground floor had been transformed into a large-scale market, broadcasting excited noise. Under the large black characters "As Heaven maintains vigor through movement, a gentleman strives for self-improvement," each shop was engaged in fierce competition. The joint store of Fuyu and the YWCA and the Shanggong store were busy with business. It is said that these two stores were established only after a few students' arduous efforts. Yuqun and Hualian stocked a large quantity of personal items, Kunfan donated dozens of air-raid items, and the total value of Zhengyang's goods was approximately two million, comparable to Fanhangdu. The Hujiang team was the result of twenty-two teams going out to solicit donations. The First Girls' High School stood out by offering delicious desserts. Nanping stored all kinds of cosmetics, Huguang responded to the "one item per person" campaign, with students generously donating hundreds of items, mainly homemade coffee candy, which customers competed to buy. Huadong offered low prices and high sales, stocking goods from central and southern China. Peicheng, Daozhong, Minli, and other girls' schools were set up on gradually ascending grandstands. Although the goods were few, they had already sold out due to their tireless efforts to solicit business. Huxin and Qiaoshang Factories provided an unlimited supply of gold pens and cod liver oil, charging only the cost price. Fanhangdu not only won the ticket sales championship, but also had a large store, with items arranged in long rows and customers rushing to buy them. They also sold valuable paintings and calligraphy donated by Yen Hui-ching and others. After walking around the entire market, customers of all ages were still reluctant to leave. They lingered, admired, praised, and competed to buy. The student shop assistants seemed to have all graduated from commercial colleges and, after engaging in a tireless and persistent battle, finally won. (by Yue Dazeping)

Saving on New Year's Banquets to Contribute to Charity

A letter from all the staff of Cambridge Hospital states: "We are writing to inform you that, according to our usual practice, we have a New Year's dinner. However, at a time when life is difficult and the end of the year is approaching, and in view of the many displaced compatriots suffering from hunger and cold, and the excellent children who have lost their schooling and support and are in urgent need of assistance, although we ourselves are also severely threatened by life, we are fortunate to be able to live and work in peace and do not need factory expenses, so we should economize. Therefore, we are willing to transfer the funds for the banquet given by the hospital director to a beneficial purpose. We have calculated the cost of the canceled banquet, totaling 46,000 yuan in savings certificates. After donating 13,000 yuan to the Orphan Relief and Education Institute and 13,000 yuan to the Old People's Home, we are donating 20,000 yuan in savings certificates to your newspaper to be used for scholarships. Please register us under the name of the 'Cambridge Hospital Team.'"

Social Services: "Jian Luan Su" Donated to Impoverished Mothers

An anonymous person sent a letter to this office stating: "I am writing to you because I have seen children abandoned by the roadside, which is truly heartbreaking. I am donating 100 boxes of 'Jian Ru Su' (Baby Darling) to your office for distribution to poor mothers. 'Jian Ru Su' is exclusively managed by Shanghai Guotai Enterprise Company and is based on the female physiological structure, using 'Hongluo Ju' from the South Pacific Islands and extracting its essence through scientific methods. It is effective for mothers suffering from irregular or insufficient milk supply. I am now sending the full amount, hoping that you will inspect and distribute it, providing assistance to poor women who lack milk. I trust that your office will be happy to do so." (We are deeply impressed by the anonymous person's enthusiasm for charity. Poor mothers lacking milk can apply to this office with a letter of proof. Mothers who have given birth with the assistance of this office can present their registration. First come, first served, while supplies last.)

Sports

### Mayor Lin Football Quarterfinals: Donghua and Huatong Clash, Zhongpu Defeats China with Five Goals

The second act of the Zhong Xiao Huai Football Tournament was held at the racecourse on the first day of the Lunar New Year. The Chinese team defeated Portugal 5-0, with a score of 2-0 at halftime. The Chinese team's lineup was based on friendship, supplemented by the goalkeeper of Zishi Jie, the midfield of Meng Yiliang Yu Lizhao, and the forwards Yu Liming, etc. Members of the Donghua team did not attend.

The International Huai Football Tournament opened at Jiaozhou Park on the 14th, with Italy eliminating Japan 3-1.

In the Mayor Huai Quarterfinals, Donghua and Huatong tied 1-1. Sun Jinshun charged straight in and kicked the ball near the goal seven minutes before the end of the first half. Unexpectedly, Sun had committed a handball, so the goal should not have been counted. However, Fadafu ruled that the goal was valid, leading to a dispute. The Huatong players left the field, and the referee ruled that Huatong had forfeited the match. However, Huatong was persuaded to return to the field and continue playing, but stated that the remainder of the match would be played in a friendly spirit. Therefore, the two teams each scored another goal in the second half, ending the game in a 2-2 draw. The final decision on the outcome of the match is pending the authorities' decision.

### Several Practical Methods for Evacuating the Population

-- Yu De

The necessity of evacuating the population has been discussed extensively by all parties and has already progressed from the theoretical stage to the implementation stage. However, evacuating one million people to other places is no easy task. Empty exhortations will not work, nor will it suffice to simply send one million people out of the city limits. It is necessary to have a thorough and appropriate plan in advance, and rapid and effective action is especially important. Afterwards, long-term means of livelihood should be considered for the evacuees. I will now present a few points within my limited knowledge for the reference of those in charge of the evacuation work.

The first problem to be solved is the transportation problem. At present, railways and waterways can certainly be used, but relying solely on railways and limited ships to evacuate one million people in a short period of time is almost impossible. Even if one more train is added every day, it can only evacuate 3,000 people, which is only 100,000 a month, which is simply not enough to meet the actual needs and adapt to the current emergency situation. Therefore, if one month is used for the period of preparation and registration, and one month is used for the period of evacuating the first million people, then not only must railways and waterways be relied upon, but also walking should be adopted.

Regarding evacuation by walking, there have been many precedents in various places in the past ten years, so there is no need to say more here. If this method is adopted, the following should be done:

(1) Solve the problem of protection along the way. A special escort team should be formed by the Security Command of this city, under the Jurisdiction of the escort division of the evacuation committee, to protect the safety of several designated evacuation routes.

(2) Requisition all of the city's rickshaws and even handcarts, and in accordance with the transportation system in the interior, form transportation stations section by section, under the Jurisdiction of the transportation division of the evacuation committee, to transport the luggage of the evacuees.

Regarding this point, it is necessary to explain in more detail. If the speed of walking per day is 40 li, then the evacuation line should be divided into sections of 40 li each, and a transportation station should be set up at the beginning and end of each section, and a certain number of rickshaws, handcarts, or other vehicles should be assigned to each section. Those who need vehicles to transport luggage only need to apply to the transportation station and pay a fee. The transportation station will collect the fee in full at one time according to the weight and size of the luggage, and then assign the vehicle in turn to transport it. The transportation station at the starting point will issue two receipts, one to the consignor and one to the carrier. When arriving at the end point, both receipts will be given to the transportation station at the end point at the same time. The consignor will pick up the goods with the receipt, and the carrier will pick up the money with the receipt, so that there will be no difficulties in demanding or extorting, and no complicated bargaining. The next day, the second and third transportation sections will be responsible for sending it to the designated evacuation destination.

Why change vehicles every day? Because assuming that 500 vehicles are assigned to each section, the transportation station in that section must strictly manage these 500 vehicles, register them in detail, and obtain a guarantee (or joint guarantee) to prevent theft or escape along the way. The transportation station must be absolutely responsible to the consignor.

As for the requisition of rickshaws, handcarts, or other vehicles, it is not without cost. On the one hand, a relatively fair transportation fee should be stipulated. On the other hand, it should be stipulated that a certain amount of daily necessities such as rice and firewood can be legally transported on the return journey to supply the needs of the city. Not only the amount to be transported should be stipulated, but even the price should be stipulated, so that the carriers in this section can resell them to the carriers in the next section. The resulting profit will be used as the carrier's reward for assisting in the evacuation.

(3) The evacuation destinations should be designated as several cities that are relatively worthless in military terms. The local county government must also participate in the evacuation committee. The county government should immediately investigate the local housing situation, stipulate that each person can only occupy a certain number of square feet of housing. Those who exceed this number should rent it out. Anyone who believes that there are no vacant houses to rent should obtain a certificate from the Baojia, and the county government will issue a certificate to be posted outside the door. If houses without certificates refuse to rent, the government can be petitioned to enforce it. Only in this way can the housing problem for the evacuees be solved.

(4) When evacuating, the government should stipulate that citizens are allowed to carry certain types of goods below a certain amount. For example, each person can carry industrial products such as cigarettes and matches worth less than 50,000 yuan. If a family of about five can bring about 200,000 yuan worth of goods to the interior, they will not have to worry about having no means of production and sitting idle. A large amount of industrial products accumulated in the city can at most be used as a bargaining chip for hoarding, and it also violates the principle of dispersing wartime materials. If they are transported to the countryside, they will help the circulation of money and gradually recover the cash that has flowed into the countryside in large quantities due to the purchase of food.

(5) Regarding restricting the population from returning to Shanghai from the interior, the government should painstakingly formulate detailed measures. I believe that anyone who returns to their hometown should have their residence permit revoked. Those without a Shanghai residence permit should not be allowed to pass through the inspection station. Railway and waterway transportation agencies should sell [lacuna] tickets based on the Shanghai residence permit (except for those with civil servant identification cards). This method has already been implemented in some cities, and it has not had any adverse effects on the flow of goods, etc. (In case of special circumstances, a "return permit" can be applied for from the Shanghai Municipal Government.)

In short, evacuating the population is a complicated and difficult task. Not only should detailed measures be stipulated in advance, but also extensive publicity and guidance should be carried out. The implementation should also be revised at any time and anywhere. Only in this way can the suffering of the evacuees be reduced and the evacuation work can proceed smoothly.

Explanation

Secretariat: The Municipal Government Secretariat is the nerve center of the Municipal Government. All important instructions from the Municipal Government to various bureaus and offices are issued by the Secretariat, and the daily work performance of all affiliated agencies is also managed by the various organizations of the Secretariat. The Secretariat is directly commanded by the Mayor's Secretary-General, without a separate director. Each group (soon to be changed to section) has one head and one deputy head, with about ten assistants. The three sections of General Affairs, Documents, and Personnel each have a section chief and an assistant, and a number of section members and clerks. Each of the Research and Translation offices has one director and several assistants. Special Commissioners and Counselors are responsible for handling specially assigned matters, such as investigating incidents, reviewing engineering projects, studying education, and reviewing unresolved regulations.

Police Bureau: The scope of the Police Bureau is the largest among all bureaus and offices under the Municipal Government. This is partly because the urban area is too large, and the Police Bureau was formed by the merger of the former patrol houses of the two concessions and the old municipal police bureau. Secondly, the current national government's policy guidelines clearly list security as a priority, so the police force must be fully utilized. The unique feature of the Shanghai Police Bureau compared to other places is that Chinese and foreign police officers are jointly responsible for performing duties. Currently, in addition to Chinese, there are personnel of Japanese, French, Russian, and Indian nationalities in the police force, who can all give full play to their strengths, cooperate with each other, and jointly maintain the security of Greater Shanghai.

Finance Bureau: The organizational system chart of the Finance Bureau listed in this article is the most recent situation. Under the principle of implementing organizational streamlining, the three independent agencies of the Special Consumption Tax Office, the General Accounting Office, and the Municipal Treasury were merged and absorbed, and changed into sections to achieve the effect of rapid handling of affairs and saving expenses. With sound finances, municipal administration can be promoted, so the Finance Bureau makes the greatest contribution to municipal administration.

Economic Bureau: The Economic Bureau is a product of the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, and its wartime responsibilities are considered to be second only to the Police Bureau among the various bureaus and offices of the Municipal Government. However, the situation in Shanghai is special. For example, daily necessities for citizens such as rice, cooking oil, coal, kerosene, vegetables, and fruits each have specially established control agencies, and the Economic Bureau cannot directly manage them. However, fluctuations in the prices of these many commodities can affect general price levels, so the Economic Bureau in Shanghai is currently dealing with considerable difficulty.

Bureau of Public Utilities: The parts of the Bureau of Public Utilities that are closely related to citizens were originally water, electricity, telephones, gas, etc., but now citizens' contact with the Bureau of Public Utilities is mostly limited to land transportation vehicle registration and vehicle management. In fact, the work of the Third Section is the most burdensome, and the management of other public utilities is placed in a secondary position.

Bureau of Public Works: Except for the General Affairs Section, the various sections of the Bureau of Public Works mostly work in technical fields. Each section has a head and a deputy head. Under the sections, there are also various groups. In the technical field, there are still foreign personnel serving.

Bureau of Education: The organization and responsibilities of the Bureau of Education are clearly defined. There is no need for unnecessary explanation. Only the affairs of the municipal schools in the old First to Eighth Districts in the Sixth Section are special because the organizational system of the municipal schools in the old First to Eighth Districts is completely different from other public and private schools. In the future, gradual changes can be expected to unify them.

Bureau of Health: The work of the Bureau of Health also includes much school health. In the past, the pathological examination and chemical analysis work during the era of the Public Works Department were the most well-known. Currently, among the work of the various sections, the most important are the environmental sanitation of the Third Section and the garbage removal of the Seventh Section. Environmental sanitation, such as the sampling of all unclean food and beverages on the market and the prevention of infectious diseases, are all things that cannot be ignored during wartime. In particular, the Seventh Section is responsible for removing garbage and excrement. Recently, the accumulation of garbage on city streets has hindered the city's appearance, so the work of the bureau in the future is also very difficult.

Bureau of Land Administration: Among the various bureaus of the Municipal Government, the Bureau of Land Administration has the least contact with citizens, and its nature is the most specialized. Those terms sound incomprehensible. However, this department is also indispensable, otherwise land problems cannot be solved, and how can any municipal administration begin?

### Issue of Preferential Treatment for Military Police at Entertainment Venues

— Feng Shuren

In recent years, various entertainment venues have not been aware of providing preferential treatment to military police and public officials, which has often led to misunderstandings. The author believes that the above phenomenon is a major obstacle to local security. I dare to contribute a few points based on the experience of employees in the entertainment industry.

(1) Stipulate half-price preferential treatment: This is a common practice in various countries. Regardless of the type of entertainment venue, a special half-price ticket for military police should be set up. All military police and public officials are limited to themselves and must be neatly dressed and able to present proof documents as a necessary condition for enjoying half-price preferential treatment.

(2) Regularly scheduled free performances: In addition to the daily business performance hours of entertainment venues, a specific day or performance should be specifically to entertain military police and public officials of various agencies, all free of charge. The military or responsible agency should appoint a commissioner to be responsible for taking care of the venue. If there is more than one entertainment venue in the local area, they may as well take turns performing in stages.

(3) Special preferential seats for military police: Xiantian military police and various agencies should jointly form a Military Police Entertainment Guidance and Management Committee to be responsible for handling matters. According to the seating capacity of each entertainment venue, its performance nature, and the area where it is located, specify the number of special heavy police preferential seats separately, and issue admission tickets according to the quota on a daily basis. All military police and public officials must first receive an admission ticket, and then take it to various designated entertainment venues to exchange for seat tickets. When exchanging tickets, special attention must be paid to checking documents, and it is still limited to those who wear uniforms and wear badges to prevent impersonation and resale.

(4) Special performances of educational entertainment: In this extraordinary period, in order to reward the hard work of military police and public unified leaders, it is possible to choose beneficial educational and entertaining entertainment, and arrange for regular performances in various agencies or public venues, such as dramas, plays, and movies.

The above proposals, if implemented one of them, can avoid many disputes, and will greatly benefit the social order and security, and are especially closely related to the future of the entertainment industry.

### Symposium on Price Issues (II) Previous article can be found on page 4 of the February 10th edition

Mr. Chen, the president of this newspaper: Mr. Funatsu is not only an authority in the Japanese economic community in China, but also has in-depth research on the economic phenomena in Shanghai. I believe he must have unique insights on this.

Funatsu Tatsuichiro: The first question is the standard for price assessment. As far as I know, Article 5 of the "Provisional Regulations on Wartime Price Management" promulgated by the Ministry of Industry and Commerce on January 13 last year stipulates the standard for price assessment, which is to deduct transportation costs, administrative expenses and all donations and taxes, and then add profits. The profit of the wholesale price shall not exceed 10%, and the retail price shall not exceed 20%.

During the tenure of the former director, the calculation of production costs was determined according to the following items: (1) Raw materials (2) Wages (3) Electricity (Power) (4) Transportation costs (5) Interest (6) Production equipment depreciation (7) Donations and taxes (8) Business expenses.

The current Secretary Chen of the Price Evaluation Committee calculates prices according to three categories: (1) Agricultural products, (2) Industrial products, and (3) Raw materials. The calculation standards are as follows:

(1) Agricultural products: 1. Place of origin price, 2. Transportation costs, taxes, and regulations on retail profits.

(2) Industrial products: 1. Raw material prices, 2. Fuel or power, 3. Direct production costs, 4. Indirect production costs, 5. Interest and depreciation, 6. Changes in various indexes (such as living, wholesale, and retail indexes), 7. Wholesale and retail profits.

(3) Raw materials: 1. Agricultural products are calculated according to item (1), 2. Imported goods are determined by referring to the exchange rate of inventory in the black market, 3. Controlled goods are calculated by referring to the purchase price and market conditions, 4. Industrial products are calculated according to item (2).

For the above three items, the total price is applied for by the trade association.

The second question is how to deal with the black market: (1) Cooperate with the investigation and information network organization, (2) Stipulate the registration and transfer procedures of resources, and (3) Designate transaction methods, such as establishing a tacit market for rice in Zhoujiaqiao and other locations.

The third question is how to manage resources, and special attention should be paid to cracking down on hoarding by non-industry people: (1) Thoroughly investigate bank and money house loans, (2) Conduct secret investigations: (1) The purchase and sales situation of major firms, (2) The income and expenditure situation of banks and money houses, (3) Inventory, (3) Thoroughly investigate the official registered capital and actual operating capital of firms, (4) Conduct irregular investigations of warehouses, (5) Investigate those who falsely claim to be members of the public association.

The fourth question is how to organize public associations, which should be done: (1) In terms of personnel: investigate false public associations for the sake of private police matters, eliminate and organize them. (2) In terms of organization: (1) Merge similar public associations (there are as many as five firewood industry associations), (2) Establish a Baojia organization within the public association, which must be cell-like, so that opinions can be communicated from top to bottom, and thoroughly promote the spirit of abiding by the law. (3) Strictly select the supervisors of the public association, and no longer set up nominal positions and employ private individuals (in the past, the supervisors did not actually come to work every day), (4) There are many operators who do not join the public association at present, and this matter should be cracked down on. (5) Train members - use meeting methods to make members aware of the current situation, promote the spirit of abiding by the law, and support the spirit of the municipal government and cooperation with the municipal government.

Mr. Chen, the president of this newspaper: Mr. Funatsu spoke very comprehensively and in detail. Now please ask Mr. Xiang Kangyuan to express his opinion.

Xiang Kangyuan: In the wartime economy, leveling prices is the most difficult to solve smoothly, because there are many kinds of materials, and everything about the sources of raw materials, transportation costs, and power supply can affect its costs and increase the selling price of goods, and each item is interconnected, making it difficult to solve them locally. Therefore, in order to manage prices, if you want to level the entire fleet, it is inevitable that you will get half the results with twice the effort, and you will not be rewarded for your efforts. In order to meet the actual situation, it is better to adopt a key system. For example: select a few necessities of life, such as rice, firewood, vegetables, silk cloth, cooking oil, soap, and matches. The government must ignore all the difficulties and obstacles and use its full strength to level them, so as to stabilize the minimum level of people's livelihood. For the rest of the goods, those that have no direct relationship with the public may as well let them rise and fall naturally, and there is no need to do fruitless work. If people with superior financial resources buy some non-essential items at high prices, they do not care, so why should the government work hard to manage all secondary materials, so that if it is not done well, it will turn into a joke that the black market is lower than the limited price (such as shirts)?

According to observations over the past three years, the rise in all prices seems to be led by the rise in rice prices, so if the price of rice can be reduced as much as possible, the rising momentum of other materials can also be slightly reduced. On the contrary, if the price of rice cannot be leveled, and it continues to soar, then trying to reduce the price of other materials is like climbing a tree to catch fish.

At present, in order to suppress the prices of daily necessities, (A) passive aspects: (1) We must use all our political power to strictly prohibit the heavy extortion at the place of origin and during transportation. Using heavy punishment in troubled times can be implemented in this situation. (2) In terms of finance, adopt a strict policy of contracting currency and credit to reduce hoarding power. (B) In active aspects: (3) The government should assist various public organizations to purchase a large amount of products from the place of origin to Shanghai, and the army and police should protect them along the way to eliminate all exploitation, so as to enrich the source. (4) Restore the power supply of various factories as soon as possible, because the production of various factories is now stagnant due to the lack of power, which not only reduces the supply of materials, but also still contains a lot of workers, who consume materials and do not produce, which inevitably poses a threat to the weight of the stock of goods, so the price of goods will rise endlessly. Therefore, restoring factory power is an important item in the price policy, and I hope the authorities will pay close attention to it.
