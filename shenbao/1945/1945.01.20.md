### Powerful Japanese Troops Advance: Assault Enemy Artillery Positions, Battles Gradually Intensifying in the Agno River Area

Tokyo, 19th (Central News Agency dispatch) – The Japanese General Headquarters announced at 3:00 PM on the 19th: Subsequent battle conditions in the Lingayen area are as follows: (1) Enemy troops in the Lingayen and Dagupan areas have generally advanced to the Agno River area. Enemy troops in the San Fabian area have generally advanced to a line four kilometers from the coast. A portion has infiltrated the first line of Japanese positions, and battles are gradually intensifying. (2) A powerful Japanese advancing unit broke into the enemy lines near San Fabian on the night of January 16th, achieving great results. The unit's assault targeted enemy artillery moving in that area, and as of the morning of the 18th, they had not yet begun firing.

Manila, 19th (Central News Agency dispatch) – The enemy attempted to occupy Manila during this Luzon Island campaign. However, fearing a frontal assault on Manila, which would inevitably be met with a prepared ambush by Japanese forces and result in heavy bloodshed, the enemy has not yet landed in Manila Bay. However, such landings can be expected in the future, and it is even more necessary to be vigilant against paratrooper landings. The Japanese army will undoubtedly be able to deploy its winning tactics against these. As for the Japanese soldiers in Manila, they are preparing for the coming decisive battle.

Japanese Elite Forces Stand Ready in Strict Formation

Tokyo, 19th (Central News Agency dispatch) – The Asahi Shimbun here recently reported on the strength and losses of the American forces in the Philippines, stating that the enemy is currently combining strong forces to carry out operations in the Philippines, including Leyte Island, seven islands, Mindoro Island, and Lingayen Bay, four islands. Luzon Island is encountering the largest land force enemy forces have encountered since the start of the war. However, in the Leyte area, due to the heroic fighting of Japanese special attack units and land forces, the enemy suffered heavy losses. According to the headquarters of General MacArthur on the 25th of last month, the total number of killed, wounded, and missing was 11,217. More than a month has passed since then, and the enemy's losses are estimated to have reached tens of thousands. At the same time, on the Luzon Island front, Japanese elite forces are standing ready in strict formation, and if the American forces attack again, they will inevitably suffer even greater sacrifices.

Enemy Forces in Lingayen Gulf Fear Assaults and Raids

Luzon Island Frontline Base, 19th (Central News Agency dispatch) – After the enemy landed in Lingayen Gulf, they have clearly failed to advance due to the fierce attacks of the Japanese army. Currently, what the enemy fears most are the special attack units descending from the sky and the assault troops in the night. Before the landing, in order to prevent the valiant collisions of the Japanese special attack units, despite the protection of a large fleet, they disguised transport ships as aircraft carriers or divided soldiers into small boats, doing their best to disperse in order to avoid losses. Their purpose was to prevent attacks from the land-based Japanese forces. In the Leyte battle line, they strengthened numerous machine gun positions around the perimeter of their positions and installed countless sound collectors in front. This time, deeply aware of the difficulty of preventing Japanese assault troops, they used a large number of military dogs in Lingayen Bay, deploying them around the perimeter of their positions. However, the resolute Japanese suicide squads did not take this to heart and continued their fierce attacks through the night, the enemy desperately defending.

Two Attempts to Cross the Bitin River Were Valiantly Repulsed

Philippine Frontline Base, 18th (Central News Agency dispatch) – According to a report from a certain Japanese base on the 17th, on the evening of the 14th, the battle in the Lingayen Gulf area unfolded with the area east of San Fabian and the Biti-nao area to its southeast as the center. While facing each other in the direction of Biti-nao to the south, the enemy twice attempted to cross the Bito River and attack on the 14th, but both times they were valiantly repulsed by the Japanese army and suffered great damage. The enemy also infiltrated the highlands four kilometers west of Luzon and continued to engage in small-scale battles. On the Nao front, the enemy's main force attempted to break through the Japanese lines but was ultimately repulsed by the Japanese army. In addition, the focus of the enemy's naval shelling and bombing was on attacking Nao. At the same time, the Japanese army also concentrated heavy firepower and fiercely bombarded enemy ships, positions, and supply depots.

Many British Killed and Wounded in Bombing of Hong Kong Internment Camp

Hong Kong, 19th (Central News Agency dispatch) – The enemy mobile units that invaded the South China Sea began attacking on the 15th and 16th, aiming at various parts of Portuguese-controlled Macau, destroying hospitals, and massacring civilians and third-country nationals, demonstrating extreme cruelty. During the air raid on Hong Kong, they also strafed the Hong Kong internment camp for people from enemy nations, causing many British casualties. Therefore, the British are extremely angry and indignant at the American planes' indiscriminate bombing. It is reported that the enemy carrier-based planes that attacked on the afternoon of the 16th, due to the fierce fire from Japanese anti-aircraft guns, dropped fifteen or sixteen bombs on the Hong Kong internment camp. The houses in the internment camp were shattered and destroyed. Fifteen British people were killed (ten men and five women), and four were seriously injured (two men and two women). The enemy planes continued to strafe with machine guns, wounding dozens of people severely (including thirty British). According to records, the internment camp was registered by the Japanese with the International Red Cross in Geneva after the start of the war, which the British and Americans should have known. Moreover, the weather was very clear at the time of the air raid, so there was no possibility of error in identification even from high altitude. Therefore, those interned are extremely indignant at the American planes' blind bombing. The former Chief Civil Administrator of the Hong Kong Governor's Office, Gimson, presented a letter to the Japanese authorities on the 17th in his capacity as a representative of the internment camp, strongly condemning the inhumane behavior of the American planes and expressing his intense anger, while also thanking the Japanese authorities for their post-disaster arrangements.

### Air Battle Over Osaka and Kobe: Battle Results Under Investigation, Ten Enemy Planes Shot Down in Sett Area

Tokyo, 19th (Central News Agency dispatch) – The Japanese General Headquarters announced at 5:40 PM on the 19th: Eighty enemy P-29 type planes attacked Osaka, Kobe, and other places from the Mariana Islands on the afternoon of the 19th. The results of the interception battle are currently under investigation. There has been some slight damage to the ground on the Japanese side.

Tokyo, 18th (Central News Agency dispatch) – Thirty-six enemy planes invaded the Sett area on the 16th. The Japanese air force immediately intercepted them, shooting down six (one unconfirmed) and destroying four. Japanese losses were very slight.

Tokyo, 19th (Central News Agency dispatch) – At approximately 9:20 AM on the 18th, one B-29 type plane from the Mariana base intruded into the Osaka and Kobe areas of Japan for reconnaissance. The Japanese air defense forces immediately intercepted it, and the enemy plane was hit by anti-aircraft fire over Osaka. It attempted to escape, dropping its cargo into the Kumano Sea, but Japanese fighters continued to pursue it, launching a fierce attack and shooting it down.

### North China University Students Inspection Group Arrives in Shanghai

Nanjing, 18th (Central News Agency dispatch) – A group of fifteen students from the North China University Winter Vacation Inspection Group arrived in Shanghai by train early on the 18th.

### Japanese Navy Awaits Action, Production Power Progressing Smoothly

Tokyo, 19th (Central News Agency dispatch) – The Yomiuri Shimbun recently published an article titled "Japanese Navy Awaits Action," stating the following: After the American mobile forces carried out air raids in the Taiwan area, their main force invaded the South China Sea from the Bashi Channel. On the 15th and 16th, they attacked Taiwan, Hong Kong, Guangdong, Shantou, and ships sailing in the South China Sea again, hindering the Japanese military's supply capabilities and attempting to isolate the Philippines. The Japanese Navy immediately prepared its stance after the air battle over Taiwan and the naval battle in the Philippines last October. The modern navy, mainly composed of the air force, awaits the opportunity to annihilate the enemy American mobile forces. Although Japanese production is under enemy bombing, it is still progressing smoothly. The Japanese naval power, backed by the blood and sweat of a hundred million people, will surely destroy the enemy mobile forces.

Editorial

### Stabilizing Prices First

We have repeatedly called for the urgency of stabilizing prices, and we have repeatedly contributed our humble opinions on how to stabilize prices. However, despite the expectations of all parties, prices continue to rise rather than fall, making it difficult to alleviate the situation. High prices are the source of all the suffering of the citizens. As we pointed out in a recent editorial, as the mayoralty changes, the most important thing for the citizens to pray for is the stabilization of prices, and the first thing that the new municipal authorities should do with decisive measures is to stabilize prices. So today we want to shout loudly to the municipal authorities:

"Stabilizing Prices First!"

There are several factors that are currently keeping prices slightly calm!

First, the so-called "big rise, small fall" (actually a big rise, a small leveling) is a common phenomenon after a big rise in prices in recent years. Originally, after a big rise in prices, on the one hand, due to the sudden decline in social purchasing power and the need for speculators to recuperate, there is often a very short period of stagnation. On the other hand, tightening credit and weakening hoarding in the midst of price fluctuations invisibly tend to stabilize prices slightly. At the same time, under the supervision of public opinion, the authorities routinely make statements or talks about cracking down on and suppressing speculation. Although these are not necessarily effective in practice, speculators avoid the limelight by observing and waiting, thus slightly curbing the rising price trend, which is also a fact.

Second, the Lunar New Year is approaching, and all industries are busy preparing for settlement or conserving energy for the coming year. The market changes from activity to stillness, a phenomenon that occurs every year. Moreover, as the Lunar New Year approaches, not only is credit tight in all industries, but individuals are also particularly strapped for cash. With tight funds and reduced purchases, the so-called weakness of prices naturally becomes inevitable. Before the end of the Lunar New Year, if there are no excessive stimuli, prices are unlikely to jump wildly again.

All of the above are cyclical and short-term phenomena. Once the Lunar New Year is over, a wave of high prices may repeat itself. Moreover, cyclical price increases are ultimately fiercer each time. According to past experience, the rising trend at the beginning of the Lunar New Year will be even more intense than usual. Therefore, the terrible degree of the high-price wave that may return soon may be even greater than before. This is not alarmist talk. If the source of supplies still cannot be unblocked and price stabilization measures are still not perfect, the crisis is indeed very deep.

How to prevent the crisis of cyclical price increases? And how to further eliminate it? This is the urgent work that the municipal authorities must do. We have always believed that the sharp rise in prices in Shanghai, in addition to economic reasons such as insufficient supplies and poor transportation, is mainly due to artificial manipulation. Taking the price of rice over the past year and a half as an example, the price of rice was 1,800 yuan per picul in July of the 32nd year. By December of the 33rd year, it had risen to more than 40,000 yuan per picul, a difference of more than 20 times. The degree of skyrocketing has actually exceeded the possible extent of economic reasons. Price increases for economic reasons must be addressed with targeted remedies, while skyrocketing prices for artificial reasons must also be suppressed with targeted measures. Therefore, in addition to making every effort to increase production, unblock the source of supplies, and improve allocation, it is necessary to take severe measures to crack down on hoarding, investigate speculation, and prohibit official-business collusion. It is said that another reason for the slight price leveling these days is that speculators are shaken by the prestige of Chief Zhou and Chief Luo and the disconnection between officials and businessmen during the transition between the old and new administrations, so they dare not continue to be unscrupulous, which is certainly not without some relationship. In view of this, if the authorities can truly be impartial and exercise decisive measures in the future, giving severe punishments, they will certainly achieve great results in stabilizing prices. "In times of chaos, harsh punishments should be used," "Kill one to warn a hundred." We look forward to the exercise of iron-fisted measures by the municipal authorities. The "hope" that Mayor Zhou mentioned in his message to the citizens, the citizens' hopes are not too great. If prices can be stabilized and life can be slightly more stable, it can be said that a large part of their hopes have been realized.

### Enemy Forces on Luzon Island Plunged into Fierce Fighting, Captain Shiota Discusses the Philippine Island Battle Situation

As usual, the Press Department of the Allied Japanese Fleet in China held a meeting with reporters from local Chinese and Japanese newspapers at 2:00 PM on the 19th. Department Head Matsushima returned to Japan on official business, and Captain Shiota represented him, introducing the newly appointed naval advisor Masao Akita to the reporters. Then, he gave a detailed explanation of the current state of the war:

Crisis for Enemy Forces in Eastern Luzon

The ground battles on the Philippine Islands have matured since the evening of the 16th. Now the enemy and our forces are engaged in fierce fighting on a 50-kilometer-long battle line centered on Lingayen Gulf. The enemy is attacking from three directions: east, west, and center. Their main force is in Pinmneg, a village located several miles east of Lingayen Gulf. According to enemy reports, the western force has advanced the furthest, having crossed the Agno River. However, it is not yet known exactly where the enemy crossed the Agno River, which is a winding river flowing from south to northeast. At the same time, enemy reports indicate that the eastern force is in fierce fighting. Compared to the east, the west has made slightly more progress. The east has been subjected to fierce Japanese attacks and has been unable to make any progress beyond a few miles from the coastline. Based on this, it can be judged that the Japanese are using powerful mobile forces to ambush the enemy in the central plain of Luzon Island to the east of Lingayen Gulf. Japanese troops have also landed in San Fabian, and the enemy's eastern force is bound to be wiped out. The enemy's operations have been extremely slow since the landing ten days ago. Especially from the 16th to the present, the enemy has suffered serious damage, and future operations will become increasingly difficult. The enemy relies on its abundant supplies and is desperately investing in Lingayen Gulf. The Japanese forces often reduce or eliminate enemy supplies and inflict heavy blows in Mindoro Island and Sulu Sea, Moitai Island with surprise tactics. In the future, the enemy's operations will inevitably suffer major sacrifices. The enemy in Lingayen Gulf is now suffering extremely heavy damage. The Japanese have no intention of engaging in a decisive battle on the coastline, and will surely lure the enemy to the wide plains. Then, it will be possible to expand and contract freely, causing the enemy to be lured in with large forces, and then suffer heavy losses and major blows.

Naval Decisive Battle Approaching

General Yamashita, the supreme commander of the army, and Vice Admiral Okawauchi, the supreme commander of the navy, are both famous generals. They will certainly achieve considerable results in terms of operations. Regarding land battles, the most noteworthy aspects for the navy are the movements of the Nimitz Fleet and the British Pacific Fleet. The Nimitz Fleet, which was almost completely wiped out in the naval battles off Taiwan and the Philippines, has been reorganized to serve as a shield for the MacArthur forces. In terms of operations, the enemy is attempting to disrupt the supply routes from the Japanese mainland to Taiwan and the Philippines, and from China to the Philippines. They have often engaged in such activities in the past. The enemy also has a desire to obtain a base even further afield than the Philippines if possible. However, their greatest task is still to disrupt supply routes. The recent bombing in South China is also proof of the disruption of supply routes. The Japanese navy has completed replenishing aircraft after the two naval battles off Taiwan and the Philippines. The preparations for the next great naval battle have also been completed. How to deal with the Nimitz Fleet is the most pressing issue at present. The American navy already feels its own power is weak, so it is strongly urging the British Pacific Fleet to participate in the operation, and it is also asking the British Indian Ocean Fleet to feign operations in the Sumatra area to divert attention. The time for the naval decisive battle is becoming increasingly mature, and in the near future, the Japanese will secure the final victory. The Nimitz forces' dream of coming to China is gradually becoming an impossible situation. In the future, the activities of enemy submarines and aircraft on the southeastern coast of China may be unavoidable, but they will have no impact on the decisive battle.

The US Will Scheme Against Yan'an

Recently, after the American army arrived in the Philippines, it will use political tactics to scheme against the Communist Party centered on Yan'an. The US is roping in the Communist Party for political reasons, which clearly shows that it does not trust the Chongqing regime. American newspapers have also reported on this extensively. The Chongqing regime hopes that the American army will come to China, but instead it is giving the CCP an opportunity to expand its territory. This is truly the contradictory hope of the Chongqing side.

American Production Cannot Meet Demand

Captain Toyota also commented on the domestic situation in the United States. He claimed that the United States boasts of its abundant manpower and resources and is confident of winning this grand war. However, it has ultimately suffered unprecedented losses due to the fierce attacks of the Japanese army and is in a desperate situation. The telegrams issued by the American news agencies in San Francisco and Washington on the 19th are sufficient to expose the situation in the country. The original telegram reads: "Today, on the Pacific front, especially in the operations in the Philippines, the supply, repair, and replenishment problems of the American fleet have entered a critical state. Because the American fleet currently operating in that area all need repair, the lack of workers in the American production line has caused the number of ships in urgent need of repair to pile up like mountains. The production of new ships is also slow and stagnant, which will have a significant impact on future operations. In addition, the manufacturing of new weapons is extremely busy, which requires an increase in equipment and labor. From the naval perspective alone, due to the losses suffered by ships in the war against Japan, the number of ships in need of repair and new construction is increasing daily, resulting in a phenomenon of supply falling short of demand." Based on this frank admission from the American news agency, it can be seen that the American operations are difficult and the domestic situation is dire.

### Nissho Prepares to Establish Savings Bank

Tokyo, 18th (Central News Agency dispatch) – The Japanese Ministry of Finance and the Japanese Bank have been discussing the merger of the People's Savings Banks in the three cities of Tokyo, Nagoya, and Osaka to establish a savings bank. A meeting was held at 10:00 AM on the 18th, attended by the relevant personnel of the savings banks and the Ministry of Finance to discuss this matter. As a result, it has been decided that the name of the new savings bank will be Japan Savings Bank. As for the capital and other details, they will be determined at the joint meeting on the 18th.

### Germany and Britain Exchange Prisoners of War

Constance, 19th (Central News Agency dispatch) – Huitong News Agency reports: 4,600 seriously wounded German prisoners of war and 2,500 British and American prisoners of war were exchanged here yesterday morning under the supervision of the Swiss Red Cross. In addition, 875 German civilians were exchanged for the same number of North and South Americans.

### British Troops Stationed in Thessaloniki

Lisbon, 19th (Central News Agency dispatch) – According to an Athens dispatch: Based on the ceasefire agreement previously signed with British Army Commander Scobie, the Greek ELAS group withdrew from Thessaloniki, the second largest city in Greece, on the 18th. British troops also completely moved into the city and its 320-kilometer-radius strongholds that night without encountering any resistance.

### Actions of Former Czech President Beneš

Berlin Pays Attention

Berlin, 19th (Central News Agency dispatch) – German News Agency reports that Berlin political circles are paying special attention to the British news that former Czech President Beneš intends to travel to Carpathian Ukraine. Beneš anticipates that Carpathian Ukraine will have a development similar to Lublin, so he intends to go there himself to prevent the collapse of the Czech national structure. However, it remains to be seen whether Moscow will allow him to go there.

### American Shipbuilding Competition: Extreme Fear in Britain

Lisbon, 19th (Central News Agency dispatch) – German News Agency reports, according to New York sources: US Navy Rear Admiral Land stated that based on the current American shipbuilding process, the United States will have 50 million tons of shipping after the war, with a total tonnage almost equal to two-thirds of the world's commercial shipping tonnage, and four times greater than what the United States possessed before the war. Conversely, Britain's tonnage will decrease by 50%. London newspapers say that Britain expresses surprise at this phenomenon, because this is a prelude to the expansion of American exports to the world.

### Japanese Parliament to Reconvene Tomorrow: Deliberations on Decisive War Measures; House of Representatives Budget Committee to Hold Regular Meeting

Tokyo, 19th (Central News Agency) – The 86th session of the Japanese Parliament, which adjourned on the 27th of last month, is now scheduled to resume on the 21st of this month. During this recess, the war situation in East Asia has become even more critical. Therefore, the government authorities announced five emergency decisive war measures at the cabinet meeting on the 12th, aimed at swiftly implementing new regulations. These measures include a re-examination of the new national organization centered on the Imperial Rule Assistance Association (翼政會). This reconvened parliament will focus on completing the final stages of the domestic decisive war system, conducting extremely detailed deliberations.

Prime Minister Koiso Vows Determination

Upon the reconvening of Parliament on the 21st, both houses will hold their respective plenary sessions at designated times. The House of Peers is scheduled to convene at 10:00 AM, where Prime Minister Koiso will deliver a policy address, expressing the government's determination for the decisive war and urging the 100 million citizens to demonstrate a spirit of special attack (特攻). At that time, the government will also provide detailed explanations of the following decided implementation items: (1) Strengthening the air defense system, (2) Thoroughly enhancing military production increase, (3) Striving to increase food production and strengthen the self-sufficiency system, (4) Enhancing the labor system and national labor mobilization, (5) Thoroughly converting all resources into war power.

Foreign Minister Shigemitsu to Deliver Speech

Following the Prime Minister's address, Foreign Minister Shigemitsu will deliver a speech specifically on diplomatic policy, clarifying Japan's wartime diplomacy during the decisive war phase. The plenary session of the House of Representatives in the afternoon will be similar to that of the House of Peers. However, after the policy speeches by the Prime Minister and Foreign Minister, Finance Minister Ishiwata will announce financial measures, followed by a representative question from Kanemitsu Tsuneo (金光庸夫), Chairman of the Parliament's Steering Committee. Formal deliberations are scheduled to begin on the same day. The current parliamentary session has given special consideration to the decisive nature of parliamentary deliberations. On the House of Peers side, representative questions on policy speeches have also been suspended, and the composition of special committees has been simplified.

Provisional Military Expenses Soon to be Decided

On the House of Representatives side, the focus of deliberations is also limited, and comprehensive measures are in place to promptly organize crucial questions, with the aim of achieving focused deliberations. The government has already decided on over 30 legislative proposals to be submitted to Parliament, including the general account budget for the next year, amounting to over 22.2 billion yen, and the tax increase plan for the next year, amounting to over 1.9 billion yen. Currently, there is a particular urgency to decide on supplementary budget proposals and provisional military expenses. In response to this, both the House of Peers and the House of Representatives have fully reviewed the government's proposals during the recess. Therefore, the upcoming reconvened parliament will be a short session worthy of being called a battlefield parliament.

Emergency Military Production Increase Measures

Furthermore, the Budget Committee of the House of Representatives is specifically scheduled to convene around the 24th, at which time emergency measures to increase military production will be discussed in detail.

### Japanese House of Representatives Holds Investigative Committee

Tokyo, 19th (Central News Agency) – In preparation for the reconvening of the 86th session of the Japanese Parliament on the 21st, the Japanese House of Representatives held an investigative committee on the afternoon of the 18th. The Ministry of Finance invited Vice-Minister of Finance Kotohara (小童原政務次官) and directors of various related bureaus to attend, explain the general account budget proposal for this year, and answer various questions. The meeting adjourned around 4:00 PM. On the 19th, from 10:00 AM, a cabinet and various ministry committees will convene to hear explanations from the authorities regarding the government's proposed legislative proposals, conduct questioning and review, after which the preliminary review will be completed.

Imperial Rule Assistance Association Decides on Strong New Party Proposal

Tokyo, 19th (Central News Agency) – The Japanese Imperial Rule Assistance Association held a political affairs research meeting at its headquarters on the 18th. Chairman Matsumura (松村會長), Vice-Chairmen Kimura, Kibara, and Murase (木村，木曹，村瀨各副會長), as well as various staff members attended. They reviewed the "Proposal to Form a Strong New Party" decided by the Special Committee for Establishing a Certain Victory Domestic System on the 17th. Finally, it was passed that once the proposal is endorsed by the Standing General Meeting and the Provisional General Affairs Meeting on the 19th and 20th, the formal stance of the Imperial Rule Assistance Association will be decided, and President Yamarin (山林總裁) will inform Prime Minister Koiso.

### Strengthening Air Defense Posture: Japan Decides Budget; Allocates 2 Billion Yen to Increase Facilities

Tokyo, 19th (Central News Agency) – The Japanese Information Bureau announced on the 19th that the government, regarding the first item of the five major decisive war measures, the plan to strengthen the air defense posture, has examined its specific plans and is now implementing them, and has decided on a budget of 2 billion yen. The most noteworthy aspect of this decision is the increase in tunnels or air defense facilities. Moreover, these facilities are not limited to general shelters, but are also being implemented in government offices and important facilities to ensure permanence.

### Japanese Cabinet Establishes Wartime Price Deliberation Council

Tokyo, 19th (Central News Agency) – The Japanese government, in order to strengthen the implementation of price policies, has newly established a Wartime Price Deliberation Council within the cabinet, dedicated to deliberating on fundamental countermeasures and operational guidelines for wartime price policies. It was decided at a cabinet meeting on the 19th that the Information Bureau would announce the following: the Wartime Price Deliberation Council will be chaired by the Prime Minister, who will also serve as the chairman. Ten experts on price issues selected from the private sector will serve as members. After the establishment of the Wartime Price Deliberation Council, all central committees, local committees, and price consultation councils that previously had the task of determining prices will be adjusted, abolished, or renamed accordingly.

### German Political Circles Criticize Churchill's Speech

Berlin, 19th (Central News Agency) – German News Agency reports: Political figures here criticized Churchill's speech in the British House of Commons on Thursday. It is said that Churchill praised England's "honest" policy with a hypocritical attitude while expressing jealousy of the increased strength of the United States. It is also said, "England should occupy a leading position in the Mediterranean, which is nothing more than a commentary on England's particular attention to Greece and the abuse of the Italian Bonomi regime. His remarks about Nansfu (南斯夫) are equivalent to acknowledging that the Soviet Union's solution has become a fait accompli, and King Peter must accept this solution from now on, otherwise he will offend England. Churchill reiterated the request for the unconditional surrender of the Axis powers," but the entire German people are currently answering with the words "never," and the enemy's determination to annihilate Germany has been hindered by a nation resolutely fighting for its future destiny.

### German Main Forces West of the Vistula River; Fierce Street Battles in Krakow

Berlin, 19th (Central News Agency) – German News Agency reports: At a press conference on the 18th, a German military spokesman solemnly stated: The main forces of the German army on the Eastern Front have retreated from the Vistula River bend in good order, inflicting extremely heavy losses on Soviet tank formations. The actions of these German forces are now proceeding entirely according to plan. The spokesman replied to reporters' inquiries that only the advance units of Soviet tanks have so far reached the east of Łódź. In the southern sector of the Soviet offensive zone, the fighting has spread to the northern and northwestern suburbs of Krakow.

Berlin, 19th (Central News Agency) – German News Agency, military news: Fierce street battles are taking place in the northwestern part of Krakow. Enemy forces attempting to break through in the border area of East Prussia have failed.

German Forces Abandon Czestochowa and Tomaszów

Berlin, 19th (Central News Agency) – German Führer Headquarters announced at noon on the 18th that Czestochowa and Tomaszów had been captured by Soviet forces after fierce street battles.

Soviet Troop Strength Reaches Over 100 Divisions

Berlin, 19th (Central News Agency) – Hai Tong News Agency reports: On the sixth day of the Soviet winter offensive, progress has been made to the west of the battle line, and the place names are all previously unmentioned. However, German forces are still fighting as isolated units behind the Soviet tank vanguard, taking advantage of opportunities to establish strong resistance. Currently, the German High Command is selecting strongholds that can contain the Soviet advance, waiting for an opportunity to fight, so reserve troops have been specially mobilized from the rear to be ready to contain the Soviet advance in time. German forces are currently fiercely resisting the Soviet offensive between Beskids and Mir, where the Soviet force consists of 85 infantry divisions and large numbers of tanks. Twenty new Soviet divisions north of Wisła joined the fighting between Morin and Czech Hanov, attempting to break into the German front line, but were unsuccessful because German forces had already withdrawn from Czech Hanov. The Soviet offensive in the East Prussian border area has not made significant progress. The gap broken through by the Soviet army in the northern border of the German province has been recovered by the German reserve army. The Soviet army simultaneously attacked the Staruboning-Kempinning highway, and although the strength was strong, it was defeated 10 kilometers west of Staruboning.

Political Significance Highly Important

Berlin, 19th (Central News Agency) – The Soviet army launched a strong winter offensive on the 12th, from the area of Budapest to the flank of East Prussia. The strength of the Soviet army's assembled troops and weapons is rare since the beginning of the German-Soviet war four years ago. The intention is to enter the German mainland in one breath and launch a decisive battle. Since the beginning of November last year, the German Supreme Command has issued warnings to the Eastern Army, waiting for the Soviet army to launch a winter offensive, but after two months, the Soviet army gradually began to move. The reason for this is that the British and American countries have not yet expressed their attitude towards the disposal of Poland, and the Soviet Union wants to handle it alone, but is unwilling to pay a high price of sacrifice, only to help the anti-Axis army on the Western Front. Therefore, from this political point of view, the offensive was delayed. The unanimous view of well-informed people here is also that because the Western offensive attempted by Britain and the United States failed due to the German counter-offensive, and the Stalin-Roosevelt-Churchill (史羅邱) meeting is about to be held, the Soviet Union suddenly launched an offensive today in order to occupy a favorable political position at the meeting. According to reliable sources, the Greek Red Elas (愛拉斯) group suddenly concluded a truce agreement with the British-affiliated Greek government. Under the sphere of influence of the United Kingdom, the Soviet Union's adoption of this attitude, along with the winter offensive and the planned three-nation conference, are all political strategies. Another group of scholars believes that if the anti-Axis armies echo each other from east and west and launch a major offensive on both sides, the German army will be difficult to resist. However, the German army took advantage of this opportunity and suddenly switched to offensive operations on the Western Front, forcing the anti-Axis armies to retreat to the remote rear of the Western Front's fortifications, shattering their offensive attempt, making them unable to attack. Therefore, the German army can respond to this Soviet winter offensive with ease. This is the success of Hitler's (希特勒) operational guidance and is greatly admired by military experts. In short, the Soviet winter offensive contains various military and political meanings and has a great impact on the entire European war situation, which is worthy of attention.

### Polish Provisional Government Moves to Warsaw

Stockholm, 18th (Central News Agency) – Hai Tong News Agency reports: A report from Moscow stated that the Polish Provisional Government organized in Lublin moved to Warsaw yesterday.

### German Forces on the Western Front Grasp the Initiative; British Forces Land on Schouwen Island

Lisbon, 19th (Central News Agency) – Although the war on the Eastern Front is becoming increasingly tense, the initiative on the Western Front remains in the hands of the German forces.

American and American Forces in Europe Suffer Heavy Losses

Lisbon, 19th (Central News Agency) – Hai Tong News Agency quoted news from Washington: US Secretary of War Stimson (史汀生) stated yesterday that from June 6th of last year to January 1st of this year, the US Army suffered a total loss of 332,912 men on the Western Front. Counting 15,000 men per US division, this is equivalent to the loss of more than 22 divisions, or 55,475 casualties per month. Stimson continued that of these, 54,562 were killed in action, 232,672 were wounded, and 45,678 were missing.

### Breakdown of Chongqing-CCP Negotiations (II) Continued from Page 8, 14th

7. Zhang Zhizhong and Wang Shijie's Further Response

September 10, 1944

To Mr. Zhou Enlai:

Having received and read your letter of August 30th, we note its contents. Our previous letter conveyed the spirit of impartiality and tranquility, explaining which of the CCP's demands the Central Government could accommodate, which it could substantially accommodate, which could be left for future consideration, and which it could not accommodate. Our intention was to engage in sincere and practical discussions in order to resolve the issues. However, your letter resorts to exaggeration and distortion, completely contrary to our expectations. After carefully reading your letter, we do not wish to refute each point, but only offer a brief response on one or two, hoping for your kind consideration.

(1) The Central Government has instructed us to negotiate with you in order to achieve genuine national unity, which means that the CCP must earnestly fulfill its four promises and resolutely support "the unification of national power" and unconditionally obey the command of the Military Commission of the National Government. Your letter states, "We have fully implemented these four promises for the past eight years," and "We Communists have consistently executed the four promises." If the CCP had earnestly fulfilled its promises in the past, why would there be so many instances of the CCP encroaching upon the National Army in various regions? If the CCP is still fulfilling its promises today, why would the Central Government still need to instruct us to discuss issues such as obeying military and political orders?

(2) The Central Government has instructed us to negotiate unity in order to establish a strong foundation for the future constitutional government and the implementation of the entire Three Principles of the People. Regarding how to realize democratic politics and party issues, the Central Government's proposal already contains clear provisions, and our letter of August 10th provided a detailed explanation. However, your letter states that the Central Government "did not mention a single word" about the CCP's demands in this regard. We truly do not know why you made such an untruthful statement. What makes us even more perplexed is that your letter states, "We have thoroughly implemented the Three Principles of the People in the border region and various base areas," and that in all CCP-controlled areas, "all people and organizations enjoy all freedoms and rights." If the facts are as stated in your letter, we can only express our admiration. However, many facts compel us to deny this. Even with regard to democracy and freedom, Dr. Sun Yat-sen's teachings clearly advocated the separation of the five powers as the correct path to democracy and the guarantee of the people's freedom. The National Government does not dare to claim that it has completed all preparations for this point, and therefore does not dare to claim that it has "thoroughly implemented the Three Principles of the People." Does the CCP area have independent judicial power, independent supervisory power, and so on? Do the people in the CCP area, or even the Communist Party members, have guarantees of freedom of speech, freedom of person, and so on? If not, then for the sake of earnestly implementing the Three Principles of the People, how can we, as your letter suggests, ask the Central Government to "promote and implement throughout the country" the CCP's "various democratic measures and democratic laws"? Our previous letter urged the CCP to refrain from raising boundless abstract demands on issues such as democracy and freedom, which would only increase future disputes, and instead to engage in practical discussions with the Central Government, the National Political Council, and the Constitutional Implementation Promotion Association to find proper solutions to various issues. After reading your letter, we feel even more strongly that what we said in our previous letter was not only appropriate but also necessary.

Regarding the above two points, we hope that future discussions will not be merely empty words. As for the other statements in your letter that distort the facts, we have already responded to them one by one. Regarding issues such as troop strength and troop movements, our previous letter and oral explanations have already provided explanations, and we feel there is no need to repeat them. However, there is one point that we must solemnly declare: our previous letter stated that the Central Government's proposal had "largely accommodated" the opinions proposed by Commander Lin Biao (林彪) last year and by you recently in Xi'an. This is an absolutely truthful statement, without the slightest exaggeration. We believe that any third party, if they were to take the four articles proposed by Commander Lin Biao and the document you signed in Xi'an and compare them one by one with the Central Government's proposal of June 25th of this year, would find that our statement of "largely accommodated" is true. However, your letter still emphasizes the words "too far apart." If the Central Government's proposal is indeed "too far apart" from the CCP's demands, what is the reason for this? In a nutshell: it is only because the CCP's demands have increased with time. The opinions you expressed in Xi'an were more than the demands proposed by Commander Lin Biao last year, and the twelve articles proposed by the CCP on June 4th were more than the demands you made in Xi'an. This time, in your letter, you have added the so-called "eight oral articles" to the twelve articles. Since the demands are increasing with time, the distance cannot but be far. For example, the issue of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region and the so-called "other base areas," in the four articles proposed by Commander Lin Biao, it was stipulated that "the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region should be changed to an administrative region according to the original area, and other regions should be reorganized separately to implement the Central Government's laws." The issue of "other base areas" was not included in the document you signed in Xi'an. In the twelve conditions proposed by the CCP on June 4th, it was requested that "the elected governments of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region and the North China base areas" be recognized. In your letter this time, it is even stated that "the elected governments of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region and the North China, Central China, and South China base areas" should be recognized. In this situation of gradually expanding demands, if the negotiations fail to come close, who is responsible for this? The work of resisting Japan and building the nation is urgently awaiting completion. To this day, our country and nation still do not possess the minimum conditions for successful resistance and nation-building (that is, national unity). The Central Government and the Kuomintang comrades cannot but deeply reflect on this. Your letter states that in resolving the relationship between the KMT and the CCP, the interests of the entire country and nation should be placed first, not the interests of one party or faction. These words are excellent. We firmly believe that the Central Government and the Kuomintang will never place the interests of one party or faction above the interests of the country and nation. Therefore, we sincerely hope that the CCP will also abide by these words, so that the negotiations can make progress and all issues can be reasonably resolved.

As for your invitation to us to go to Yan'an, as long as it is beneficial to the matter, we are also happy to go, but it would be appreciated if you could inform us whether the CCP can send a responsible representative to Chongqing to resolve this issue, and who you will send as a representative to return to Chongqing with us. We reply specifically and wish you well!

Sincerely,
Zhang Zhizhong, Wang Shijie
September 10th

### Report by CCP Representative Lin Zuhan at the Chongqing参政会 (People's Political Council)

Gentlemen! The Presidium of the National People's Political Council has asked me to report on the negotiations between the National Government, represented by Mr. Zhang Wenbai and Mr. Wang Xueting, and the Central Committee of the CCP, represented by myself. I am very excited about this.

A fair and reasonable adjustment of the relationship between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party is a very important matter in the current political situation. Not only is this issue of concern to those in the People's Political Council, but the entire nation is also deeply concerned. What I am going to report today is the process of our negotiations with Mr. Zhang and Mr. Wang over the past four months. During this process, there were approximately seven important documents, which the Presidium has already distributed to everyone for reference.

Accusation that Chongqing Lacks Sincerity, Negotiations Yield No Results After Four Months

I came from Yan'an with great enthusiasm for these negotiations, hoping to resolve the problems. I was also very pleased to meet Mr. Zhang and Mr. Wang unexpectedly in Xi'an. Our negotiations have been conducted in a very friendly atmosphere. Up to now, there is a large difference in our principles. Although our negotiations have not yet reached a final stage, there are still no results to report after four months.

What we are asking of the Kuomintang Central Committee is, firstly, the issue of implementing democratic politics throughout the country. Today, as the Japanese army is deeply invading our territory and the War of Resistance is still at a difficult stage, it is essential that the entire military and civilians unite as one, and that all the people of the country are mobilized. Japan is an industrially developed country with strength. It is waging war within our borders, and we must take this serious situation seriously. China has 450 million people, but they are not united and have not been fully mobilized. Today, there is a very urgent need to unite and mobilize this entire force. What methods should be used to unite the nation's strength and mobilize the nation's power? We believe that democratic politics should be implemented during the war. Only democratic politics can unite all the nation's forces and mobilize all the nation's power to save our nation from disaster. We advocate implementing the Three Principles of the People, strictly adhere to the Outline of National Reconstruction, and the Ten Major Programs proposed by the CCP. If these three major programs are truly implemented, we can unite the strength of the entire nation. Commander-in-Chief Chiang Kai-shek said in the early stages of the war, "Regardless of north or south, old or young, everyone has the responsibility to defend the territory and resist the war." Our Party Central Committee advocated implementing democracy, mobilization, and the people from the beginning of the war, achieving a comprehensive and all-people resistance, not just a one-sided war by the government and the military. Our opinion on immediately implementing democracy to enhance national unity and combat strength has been consistent since the war, and this is what we proposed in these negotiations.

The CCP Demands the Expansion of Communist Forces, Recognition of Party and Government

Secondly, from the perspective of the relationship between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, we hope to resolve some outstanding issues. These outstanding issues mainly concern the military, political power, and the party. We have been fighting on the front lines for eight years, and the military and political situation has undergone many changes. At the beginning of the war, there were 80,000 Red Army soldiers, but the government only recognized the formation of three divisions, which were ordered to move out, cross the river, and enter Shanxi to fight. We were also given orders by the Supreme Command to organize some guerrilla advance teams to advance to the front lines to fight. From our own perspective, we have done well in difficult battles on the front lines over the years. The Eighteenth Group Army and the New Fourth Army have fought in the provinces of Jin, Ji, Cha, Re, Sui, Yuan, Liao, Lu, Yu, Su, Wan, Zhe, E, and Yue, establishing many popularly elected governments. After more than seven years of fighting, our regular army has increased to 477,500 people, and we have organized 2.2 million militiamen. We request that the government first grant us the designations of five armies and sixteen divisions. At the same time, we have established fifteen base areas in the front lines, where the people have elected their own governments, governing a population of 88 million. We hope that the government will recognize these democratic regimes in the front lines and manage and guide these regimes. In terms of the party, we demand that the government give the CCP an open and legal status, as well as other parties. We hope that the government will lift the military and economic blockade of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region, so that personnel and merchants in the border region can have the freedom to move around and travel.

Our party has presented such views to the government and the Kuomintang Central Committee. The National Government once gave us a proposal, and Mr. Zhang and Mr. Wang wanted us to handle it according to the Central proposal, but the difference between the two is very large, so that the negotiations have not yielded any results to this day. I will now briefly mention a few major points of divergence for explanation.

First, from the military issue, the regular troops led by the CCP number 477,500 people. Over the past eight years, in an extremely difficult environment, they have persisted in and developed the three major battlefields of North China, Central China, and East China, and have become the vanguard of the future general counter-offensive. In order to prepare for the needs of the counter-offensive, the government should reward it and strengthen it. First of all, it would be reasonable to fully organize 47 divisions. During the Xi'an negotiations, I requested that the government temporarily organize six armies and eighteen divisions. Mr. Zhang and Mr. Wang expressed difficulty in accepting this. The proposal of our Party Central Committee on June 4 requested that the numbers of five armies and sixteen divisions be given first, but the government was still unwilling to agree, and only agreed to organize four armies and ten divisions.

In particular, the two measures in the government's proposal, "the remaining troops after reorganization should be cancelled within a time limit" and "the organized troops should be concentrated within a time limit," failed to take into account the needs of the war and the environment of guerrilla warfare. Cancellation within a time limit is equivalent to not wanting the people to resist the war, and returning the recovered areas to the enemy, which is naturally inappropriate.

Next, let us talk about the point of divergence on the popularly elected local governments. The popularly elected governments in the front lines are all of a democratic nature. We request that the government recognize these elected governments in these areas as local governments under its jurisdiction, but the Central proposal calls for their abolition, which is incomprehensible from the perspective of the interests of the War of Resistance.

Once again, regarding the open and legal status of political parties and the protection of the people's freedom of speech, assembly, association, and personal freedom, there has been no improvement in the current situation. Let us cite a few examples to discuss the issue of freedom of speech. The government has expressed that the scale of speech should be relaxed, but in reality, we have fought many battles in the front lines in recent months. These battle reports are submitted to the Military Affairs Department every month, but they have never been published, and when they are sent to the Xinhua Daily, they are also withheld. As for the people's personal freedom, the government announced on August 1 that it would be responsible for implementing protection regulations, but in fact, we have repeatedly requested the release of General Ye Ting. He is neither a Communist Party member, nor did he go to the New Fourth Army on the advice of the government, so he should not be detained. We request the release of Mr. Liao Chengzhi, the son of Mr. Liao Zhongkai, who was arrested after returning to Guangdong after the fall of Hong Kong. In addition, there are many political prisoners imprisoned, and we also request their release, but none of this has been achieved.

The Communist Side Claims to Have Practiced Promises, But Opinions Are Still Far Apart

In addition, Mr. Zhang and Mr. Wang also criticized our party in their letters for not implementing the four promises, which also needs to be explained. We held a meeting in Yan'an last December to seriously review this, and the results of the review further prove that our four promises have indeed been fully fulfilled and kept unchanged. For example, taking the first promise: "Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Three Principles of the People are essential for China today, and our Party is willing to strive for their complete realization," our implementation of nationalism is manifested in our efforts to fight and respect the equal status of all ethnic groups within the border region. Our implementation of democracy is manifested in the popularly elected governments in the border region and various base areas in the front lines, implementing the "Three-Thirds System" and guaranteeing the people's freedom of speech, assembly, association, personal freedom, and all other freedoms. We are working hard on the production movement, reducing the burden on the people, reducing the public grain from 200,000 dan in the year before last to only 160,000 dan this year. We do not put the entire burden of the public on the people's heads. The second promise: "Cancel all policies of violent insurrection to overthrow the Kuomintang government and the Red Movement, and stop the policy of forcibly confiscating landlords' land," we have adhered to this unchanged for seven years. In the relationship between peasants and landlords, we guarantee the payment of rent and interest on the one hand, and implement rent and interest reduction on the other. We help the development of private industry and develop cooperatives, achieving mutual benefit between the public and private sectors. We have long practiced our promises and have never thought of overthrowing the Kuomintang government. The third promise: "Cancel the current Soviet government, implement democratic politics to seek the unification of national power," this has been truly implemented in various base areas in the front lines. We have not established a separate central government. We only ask the government to recognize the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region and the popularly elected governments in the front lines as local governments under its jurisdiction. We are in favor of unification, and China must be unified, but unification must be democratic unification. The fourth promise: "Cancel the name and designation of the Red Army, reorganize it into the National Revolutionary Army, be under the command of the Military Affairs Commission of the National Government, and await orders to move out and assume the reality of fighting on the front lines," we have been implementing this for a long time, and the achievements of our army in fighting hard on the front lines are proof. Our troops have never received a single penny of supplies in recent years, but they still insist on fighting on the front lines and supporting the National Government and Chairman Chiang Kai-shek. All these facts are enough to show that we have fulfilled our promises. Mr. Zhang and Mr. Wang have criticized us for the lack of independence in legislation and supervision, but we have effectively guaranteed the human rights, property rights, and land rights of people at all levels in the judicial field. We rely entirely on the people to impeach the government, so there are very few cases of corruption and dereliction of duty on our side.

Although the distance between the two sides is still so great, but I can declare again that the Chinese Communist Party has consistently adhered to the policy of uniting to resist Japan and patiently awaits a change in the government's views.

Narrating the Suspension of Negotiations, Pointing Out the Chongqing Side's Distortion of Facts

Now, let me explain the process of negotiating with Mr. Zhang and Mr. Wang in Chongqing since Xi'an. Since the Eleventh Plenary Session of the Kuomintang passed a resolution to adopt a political solution to the relationship between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, we were very happy when we heard about it in Yan'an and agreed very much. Because since the New Fourth Army incident in 1940, the relationship between the two parties has been very tense. I am a member of the People's Political Council, but I could not come out due to the blockade. We asked the liaison staff officer stationed in Yan'an by the Military Affairs Commission to send a telegram stating that we were willing to come to Chongqing to continue negotiations. After the government replied with consent, I was in charge of border region administration and still needed to arrange spring plowing, so I could not leave until the end of April. In Xi'an, I met with Mr. Zhang and Mr. Wang a total of five times. When I first met Mr. Zhang and Mr. Wang, I mainly asked how the government's political solution was to be solved? And report to them on the situation in the border area. Mr. Zhang and Mr. Wang repeatedly asked me to raise specific issues for discussion. At that time, I proposed using Comrade Zhou Enlai's speech on the birthday of the Father of the Nation on March 12 of this year as the basis for negotiations. Mr. Zhang and Mr. Wang did not agree. They proposed discussing military and border region issues first, and I thought it was okay, because I first reported the number of troops under the leadership of the CCP, and asked how many the Central government could agree to organize for us? Mr. Zhang asked me to speak, and I said please give six armies and eighteen divisions first. Mr. Zhang and Mr. Wang thought it was too much and only agreed to four armies and twelve divisions. After several consultations, when talking at the last meeting, it was agreed to organize the opinions of both parties in previous meetings into records. Both parties signed and reported to their respective central governments for final decision by the two parties. At that time, I signed on this record first in accordance with our original agreement, but Mr. Zhang and Mr. Wang did not sign. The record was a synthesis of the opinions of both parties, and the letter from Mr. Zhang and Mr. Wang was only my personal opinion, which was obviously not the truth.

After arriving in Chongqing, the Central Committee of our Party immediately sent a telegram proposing twenty opinions, which I handed over to Mr. Zhang and Mr. Wang on May 22, asking them to forward them to the Kuomintang Central Committee. Mr. Zhang and Mr. Wang believed that some conditions in the proposal were tantamount to announcing the crimes of the Kuomintang and refused to accept them. In order to respect the opinions of Mr. Zhang and Mr. Wang, I asked my Party Central Committee to change the twenty items to twelve items, and the remaining eight items were changed to oral requests, which I handed over to Mr. Zhang and Mr. Wang on June 5. At the same time, Mr. Zhang and Mr. Wang handed me the government's proposal, but refused to accept and forward the proposal of our Party Central Committee. The dispute continued until June 15, when they replied that they had forwarded it to the government, but the solution was still based on the government's proposal and could not be changed, and the negotiations reached a deadlock.

At that time, Mr. Liang Hancao, Minister of the Propaganda Department of the Kuomintang Central Committee, made a statement to foreign reporters saying that the negotiations had stalled and the CCP should be aware of this. On July 2, I published a statement in the Xinhua Daily, expressing that our party's attitude is that we can discuss anything that is conducive to the War of Resistance, unity, and the promotion of democracy. On July 26, Minister Liang published another statement in English that was not in line with the facts. Comrade Zhou Enlai of our Party published a statement on August 13, explaining that the negotiations had not yielded any results and explaining that the responsibility for this matter was not on us. However, our Party Central Committee still hoped that the negotiations could yield results, and sent a telegram inviting Mr. Zhang and Mr. Wang to go to Yan'an to continue negotiations. Mr. Zhang and Mr. Wang said that this matter could be discussed. The course of the two parties' negotiations is roughly like this.

Attacking Chongqing for Poor Politics, Demanding the Organization of a Coalition Government

Finally, I must declare: The Chinese Communist Party very much hopes to resolve the problem. The opinions we have put forward are correct and reasonable. We hope that the government can proceed from the interests of the War of Resistance, democracy, and unity and accept our reasonable demands. In order for China's War of Resistance to maintain its current glorious international position and achieve lasting peace, we cannot wait for the struggles of our allies, but need to rely more on our own efforts and need to unite and mobilize the strength of the whole country to stop the enemy's offensive and prepare our forces to cooperate with the Allied counter-offensive. We believe that the urgent remedy to save the current military crisis and prepare for the counter-offensive is to quickly change the government's structure, personnel, and policies. The various inquiries from the gentlemen of the People's Political Council in the past few days have also shown that there are many problems with the structure, personnel, and policies of our government, which are not suitable for the needs of the war today. Therefore, I frankly propose that the Kuomintang immediately end its one-party rule, and that the National Government convene representatives from all parties, factions, combat troops, local governments, and people's organizations to hold a national conference and organize a coalition government of all parties to renew the world's eyes and ears, inspire the hearts of the people, encourage the morale of the front lines, so as to strengthen national unity, concentrate national talents, and concentrate national strength.

### Municipal Authorities Determined to Rectify Station Order, Eliminate Illegal Extortion, Eliminate Black Market for Tickets

The traffic order at the city's North Railway Station has long been chaotic, the black market for tickets is becoming increasingly serious, and the illegal extortion by general scalpers has caused great threat to legitimate travelers. The relevant authorities have held meetings and exhausted their greatest determination to study good strategies to solve this important traffic problem. The municipal authorities have recently, after long consideration and serious review, clearly ordered the establishment of a station police station, determined to correct various places that make it difficult for travelers. A reporter from the Central News Agency believed that all parties placed the greatest expectations on the establishment of the station police station, so they specially visited the relevant authorities to find out about the situation of improving travel that is about to be implemented as follows:

The personnel who are responsible for the execution and management of station order and traffic, and the elimination of various illegal acts for this station police station establishment, have all been hired after long and cautious assessment. All police officers are single and of good character, and will be treated as high as possible to absolutely ensure that they are sufficient to maintain their lives, so that they can exert their work effectiveness and not be tempted by profit to engage in corruption and extortion. Extremely strict methods will be implemented to manage the executing personnel, first seeking to revitalize the police themselves, and resolutely eliminate the scalper parties and scalpers who are parasitic in the station and do evil in the short term. Black market tickets will be eliminated within one month, and legitimate passengers and public officials will be given the greatest convenience in the future. In addition, opinion boxes will be set up in various places in the station so that passengers can report or make suggestions in writing when they encounter difficulties or discover extortion, and it is hoped that they will be reported directly at any time. In short, we must achieve cooperation between officials and the people, and work together to thoroughly eliminate all difficulties for travelers at the station in the shortest possible time. At the same time, at the various docks on the Bund, when ships are in port, there are also many scalpers and hooligans who extort passengers. It is hoped that the authorities will give them the same treatment.

### Public Works Bureau Official Corruption Case: Director Zhang Talks, Internal Investigation Completed, Truth to be Announced

Regarding the case of the municipal public works bureau officials cutting down trees and selling them, various newspapers have reported on it in recent days. A reporter from the Central News Agency specially visited Zhang Enlin, director of the Public Works Bureau, who made the following statement: "After investigating the case of corruption by members of this bureau, I received a secret report from an official of the Road Section on January 9. I immediately went to the Jungong Road Hongqiao Road area to conduct an on-the-spot investigation and confirmed that there was indeed evidence of tree cutting. Therefore, I secretly submitted the investigation evidence to the Municipal Government on the 11th, requesting that the relevant personnel be suspended from duty and investigated. The Municipal Government has ordered the police to detain and strictly interrogate the relevant criminals. The Bureau is also conducting a detailed and thorough investigation into the case. After the investigation is completed, the truth will be announced." Regarding the other sections published in the Times, Zhang will publicly reply in the next few days.

### Thugs Impersonate, Extort, Arrested and Severely Punished

Recently, they have become active in Shanghai, and there are many victims. After strict investigation, the above-mentioned criminals have been arrested one after another and dealt with in accordance with the law. It is hoped that citizens will report to the competent branch bureau and arrest and prosecute them if there are any more thugs who impersonate names and extort money.

### Hubei Compatriot Association Continues to Provide Second Scholarship

In order to subsidize Hubei students studying in Shanghai who are unable to attend school due to financial difficulties, the Hubei Compatriot Association in Shanghai initiated and established a scholarship in the summer of last year.

During the current winter vacation, it has been decided to continue to prepare the second scholarship. A scholarship committee has been formed separately, and an office has been set up at No. 1 Huichengli, Qingcheng Road (Medan Road), to actively proceed. The notification is from the 19th to the 25th of this month to handle scholarship registration.

Shanghai Postal Administration News: "It has been reported that unscrupulous individuals dressed in green uniforms similar to those of postmen, carrying leather bags, are impersonating postal messengers and claiming hardship to peddle daily necessities such as low-quality towels, pencils, etc., to the public. They also carry donation books to solicit relief funds. Postal messengers are strictly prohibited from soliciting anything from the public outside of delivering mail. Such behavior not only causes unnecessary losses to the public but also damages the reputation of the postal service. If you encounter such situations, you are advised to refuse them outright to prevent the perpetrators from succeeding in their tricks, or even report them to the nearest police station for legal action."

### "Hard Work" Needs Backing

Hoping Enthusiastic People from All Circles Eagerly Purchase Tickets

The newspaper and *Xin Bao* newspapers' student aid fund, fervently supported by colleagues of "Hard Work", will stage a charity performance of the famous play "Autumn Begonia" at 7:00 PM on the next two evenings. This event was actively prepared by representatives from "Hard Work" and both newspapers, completing arrangements in just four days. Now, the only hope is to ask enthusiastic people from all circles to distribute tickets and contribute to this charitable endeavor. For example, the public letters jointly issued by the authorities of *Shen Bao* and *Xin Bao* in the past two days, attached with numerous "Honor Tickets" worth 5,000 yuan and 10,000 yuan, totaling only two types worth 40,000 and 50,000 yuan, respectively. We urge everyone to purchase them in full or jointly with several people. The ticket fees should be sent to the social service departments of the two newspapers for publication within a few days to reward your kind intentions. The recipients of these letters have been carefully selected, either being prominent figures in Shanghai or reputable figures in industry and commerce. These meager 40,000 to 50,000 yuan are equivalent to ten yuan before the war, which is just a drop in the bucket for the powerful, but it can save three impoverished students from dropping out of school. By watching a famous play, you can also enjoy the reputation of helping students, achieving two goals with one stone. Why not do it? In addition to being concerned about box office sales, the two branches of the Bank of Communications are also assisting in the sale of ordinary tickets worth 500 yuan and 1,000 yuan. We hope that people from all circles will "not forget to help students while being entertained", purchase more tickets, enjoy them with their families, or invite friends to have fun together. It is anticipated that both charity performances will be full, and the ticket revenue will exceed the budget, so as not to disappoint the sincerity of the colleagues of "Hard Work", and also a beautiful act promoted by the public. We respectfully offer our heartfelt prayers for impoverished students!

(Note) People from all circles are very enthusiastic about purchasing "Honor Tickets". Yesterday, we received ticket funds amounting to hundreds of thousands of yuan. The list will be compiled and published simultaneously in *Shen Bao* and *Xin Bao* to show our gratitude.

Donations are Welcomed for Charity Market

Although the Reader's Student Aid Fund has received enthusiastic donations from all walks of life, the tuition fees for the next semester have increased sharply, resulting in insufficient funds for distribution. Therefore, in addition to continuing to raise donations, we have specially joined forces with the *Xin Bao* and the YMCA and YWCA to launch a charity market to help those who have dropped out of school. The target is tentatively set at 10 million yuan. It is hoped that the goods sold will be donated entirely by major companies and manufacturers in the city to benefit the poor, so as to cultivate social talents, and indirectly help the development of China's industry and commerce in the future. The charity market is scheduled to be held at the YMCA at Eight Immortals Bridge on February 15th and 16th. Starting from today, we will begin soliciting items for charity sale. If you would like to donate, please send them to the YMCA at Eight Immortals Bridge or call 84040 for consultation. At that time, shopping in the market will not use cash, but will use vouchers printed by the four groups. The vouchers are divided into four types: 100 yuan, 500 yuan, 1,000 yuan, and 5,000 yuan, which are now openly sold by the two YMCA and YWCA. In addition, in order to encourage the spirit of self-help and helping others, the four groups hereby invite students from major middle schools to voluntarily participate in the solicitation of goods, promotion of vouchers, and service at the venue for the charity market. Students from all schools who are interested in participating in the service are invited to contact the YMCA and YWCA from today.

Birthday Banquet Funds Transferred to Student Aid Fund

A letter from Mr. You Heling of Asia Bread and Candy Factory states: "I am writing to inform you that the 18th of this month is my father's sixty-sixth birthday. Relatives, friends, and acquaintances in the community have all requested to offer their congratulations at the appropriate time. However, my father believes that this is an extraordinary time and does not want to be extravagant. He will not accept gifts or host a banquet, and will donate the money saved from the banquet to the student aid fund. It is both a blessing for the birthday celebrant and a blessing for relatives, friends, and acquaintances. Heling respectfully complies with his father's wishes. Herewith, I enclose national currency 20,000 yuan to donate to the student aid fund, under the name 'Asia Bread and Food Factory Team'. I hope you will accept it."

Health Association Supports Student Aid

A letter from the Chinese Health Association states: "We believe that education is the foundation of a country, and health is the foundation of a career. In response to your newspaper's special appeal for donations, we have decided that all income from outpatient tuberculosis X-ray examinations from the 22nd to the 29th of this month will be used to subsidize the student aid fund. We hope to use this opportunity to implement checkup and tuberculosis prevention work for residents of the city, so that those who believe they are healthy can obtain powerful proof, prevent disease if they are not ill, and obtain early treatment if they are found to be ill, and thus achieve great results. We are extremely grateful."

Money Exchange Colleagues Enthusiastically Raise Donations

A letter from colleagues at Yongyi Money Exchange states: "We, colleagues, are aware that the tuition fees for the next semester are increasing, and the number of students dropping out of school is increasing. With the start of the semester approaching, we read in your newspaper that you are making a special appeal for donations. Therefore, we have specially launched a colleagues' team to raise 60,000 yuan in legal currency, which will be equally distributed to your newspaper and the *Xin Bao* newspaper's student aid fund. Herewith, we send 30,000 yuan, and we hope you will check and accept it."

### Quick Sketch of the "Autumn Begonia" Performance

— Gong Jia

"Autumn Begonia" is a famous play that has broken all previous box office records. When it was staged at the Carlton Theatre two years ago, it was widely known and caused a sensation, playing for months, which shows how deeply it touched people. This time, the "Hard Work" Drama Troupe re-staged the play to raise funds, and the scene at the entrance of the Lansin Theatre was still crowded with people and horses. The performance was even better than the previous one. I was fortunate enough to participate in the event, and I dare to record the performance in detail for the public.

The cast includes Shen Minzhi, Luo Xiangqi, Shangguan Lingzhu's Mei Bao, Shi Yuan's Zhao Yukun, Bai Wen's Ji Zhaoxiong, Liu Ji's Luo Shaohua, etc., all of whom are among the best of their time. It is especially commendable that Shi Hui and Zhang Fa both played Qiu Haitang before and after. The cast is stronger and more organized than the original cast.

The plot enters a tragic state from the fourth act. In the second scene of the fifth act, when Luo Xiangqi and Mei Bao meet as mother and daughter in the restaurant, Shen Min and Shangguan Lizhu's performance is extremely moving, and many audience members cry uncontrollably.

In the first half, Zhang Fa's Qiu Haitang is played with elegance and loveliness, and in the second half, Shi Hui's performance is desolate and melancholic. The hero is short of breath, and the children are affectionate, which makes people can't help but shed tears of sympathy. The teaching scene received thunderous applause from the audience, and it is no wonder that Zhou Wu was so strange.

Shi Yuan's Zhao Yukun is straightforward and neat, Bai Wen's Ji Zhaoxiong is cunning and sinister, Wang Jun's Xiaogouzi is stupid and silly, Zhuang Yan's mute maid is innocent and cunning, Le Yao's Yuan Baofan is rough and ugly, and Xin An's Shang Laoer is greasy and sour. All the above roles are incisively portrayed and complement each other, making the whole play more colorful.

At the end of the play, the audience applauded enthusiastically, and even some shouted "Bravo!" The audience did not leave until the actors took a bow again and again. At the entrance, I still saw people wiping away tears with handkerchiefs. The appeal of the drama can be seen from this.

### Middle School Basketball League Opens Today

The Middle School Basketball League, organized by the Sports Department of the YMCA and YWCA, is scheduled to open grandly at 2:00 PM today in the gymnasium of the association at Eight Immortals Bridge. Nineteen middle schools, five women's teams, and seven junior teams will participate in the competition. Because the number of participants in the middle school group has exceeded the quota, it is divided into two divisions, "Middle" and "School". The Middle Division has ten teams, including Fuqun, Guanghua, Zhongli, Qingnian, Jinmou, Huxin Huang, Nanmo, and Hongyi. The School Division has nine teams, including Huxin Lan, Zhonggong, Fanhuang, Gubai, Zhongli Hei, and Huxin Bai. There will be no tickets sold at the time, and visitors are welcome. Today's schedule is as follows: Huxin Bai vs. Gubai (School Division) 2:00 PM, Zhongli Hei vs. Fanhuang (School Division) 2:30 PM, Guanghua vs. Yan Team (Middle School) 3:30 PM, Leye vs. Black and White (School Division) 4:10 PM, Yongfang vs. Xinqie (Junior) 5:00 PM.

### How to Stabilize Shanghai's Commodity Prices

— Jiang Lianjun

Over the past year, commodity prices in this city have skyrocketed, business has sharply declined, transportation has been sluggish, all industries have waned, and the people's livelihood has deteriorated to the extreme. The people are the foundation of the nation, and when the foundation is solid, the nation is secure; those who win the people prosper—ancient wisdom makes this clear. Shanghai is the national supply center for goods; how can we allow the situation to continue to worsen, depleting the people's strength and impoverishing their lives? The author will now present a few key points regarding the current critical issues, hoping that the new municipal authorities, who care about the people's welfare, will take them into consideration!

(A) Short-Term Solutions: Thoroughly Inspect All Warehouses in the City: Since last November, the city's Bureau of Economic Affairs, in conjunction with the Economic Security Bureau, has been inspecting major public and private warehouses, focusing on essential daily necessities. 1. Massive stockpiles exceeding the scope of business operations; 2. Products stored for extended periods; 3. Storage by non-industry individuals—all of these practices should be banned. Two months have passed since enforcement began, but during these two months, commodity prices have continued to rise abnormally. The intensity of the price increases is rarely seen even after the incident. Although there are various underlying reasons, the fact remains that speculators are overly optimistic about the warehouse inspections. Those with discerning eyes should not find it difficult to understand the process and its effectiveness. Therefore, in the future, in addition to assigning more dedicated personnel for strict surveillance, the compensation for the inspection personnel should also be increased as much as possible, so they can focus on their duties. Once any transgressions are discovered, the most severe penalties should be imposed in accordance with wartime criminal law. Relying solely on a written notice asking merchants to report any unlawful demands from inspectors is insufficient. It is essential to understand that merchants are likely to be extorted only after they have violated the law. Reporting such extortion would be tantamount to walking into a trap, something even the most foolish would avoid.

Strictly Evaluate and Enforce Price Limits: The price limits promulgated by the Price Evaluation Committee have, in reality, had very little effect in the past. Often, the price limit set yesterday is exceeded in the black market today. If you try to buy a single candle or a bar of soap at the regulated price from any tobacco shop in the city today, you might wear out your iron shoes without finding one! Offer a higher price, and you'll get what you want. Therefore, the current price limits are of no benefit to the people and, in fact, contribute to the black market. In the future, if no price limits are to be set, then so be it. But if price limits are imposed, any instances of exceeding the limit or refusing to sell should not be handled the same way as last year, with just a few days of business suspension. Such penalties are actually welcomed by cunning merchants, as they provide a legitimate excuse to close their doors and wait for prices to rise! Therefore, violators must be immediately taken into custody and prosecuted according to law.

(B) Long-Term Solutions: Quickly Lift Restrictions on Rice Shipments to Shanghai: The rice issue is currently the most serious problem in this city. Recalling the amount of rice allocated per household last year, the total was less than 3.5 *dou* (approx. 35 liters), averaging less than 3 *sheng* (approx. 3 liters) per month. From October to December, after the autumn harvest, the allocation was only 2 *sheng* per month. How can people survive on such a small amount without resorting to the black market? To this day, the general public no longer has high hopes for household rice allocations but hopes that the price of rice is slightly lower. Therefore, we should restore the permit-based transportation system from July and August of last year. The high price of rice in this city affects the cost of general industrial products, and rural commodity prices follow suit, inevitably increasing the cost of agricultural products. This is one reason. Farmers, seeing the high price of rice in Shanghai, have aspirations, which will inevitably make it more difficult to purchase their crops. This is another. Once free transportation is allowed, rice prices should be reduced. To prevent wealthy individuals from hoarding, the following three points may be implemented:

First: Applications for transport permits should be limited to registered rice shops in this city, with a maximum quantity of 500 *shi* (approx. 50,000 liters) per shipment.

Second: After rice shops import rice, they must still sell it to citizens based on ration coupons, with purchases limited to once a month and not exceeding 1.5 *dou* (approx. 15 liters). Smaller amounts are allowed. The price should be calculated based on cost plus a reasonable profit. Furthermore, to encourage competition among merchants, citizens should be allowed to purchase rice freely from any shop using Coupon No. X, regardless of the shop number.

Third: Rice shops must submit a report to the grain management authorities every ten days, detailing the quantity purchased and sold, along with supporting documents. They must also surrender their transport permits.

If the above three points can be implemented, the people's food supply will not be scarce, and rice shops will not have to worry about sitting idle for long. As for household rice, it may be allocated according to the principle of prioritizing essential needs.

To Alleviate the Fuel Crisis, How to Carefully Re-Discuss the Issue of Coal Shipments from North China and Find Ways to Encourage Wholesale Transportation, Providing Convenience Along the Way. This would allow factories in this city equipped with wood-fired engines to continue production, and the fuel needed by citizens would also be supplied steadily.

Ultimately, success depends on human effort. With the current municipal revitalization, we place boundless hope in the new municipal authorities.

The "New Year's Voices" solicited by this newspaper will be published until the 16th of this month as per the regulations. Articles that have not been published will be moved to the National Forum for selection, and remuneration will be calculated according to the National Forum's standards. We hope our contributors will understand.

### Hua An Bank Handles Student Aid and Loans

Since moving into its new building on Shanxi Road last year, Hua An Bank's business has been thriving. The bank has always been committed to serving society. Considering the general financial difficulties of outstanding male students and impoverished citizens unable to make a living in these extraordinary times, the bank has raised 2 million yuan, half of which will be used for student aid and half for small loans. The student aid is continuous, with the bank allocating 1 million yuan each semester to cover the entire tuition and fees of each student during the semester, but temporarily limited to 30 male high school and junior high school students. The small loans are divided into three categories: 3,000, 6,000, and 9,000, with detailed regulations. Those wishing to apply for the above aid can visit the bank at 54 Shanxi Road, starting Monday, the 22nd of this month, from 10:00 AM to 12:00 PM daily, to collect application forms. Applicants for student aid must also bring their most recent academic report cards for review to determine eligibility. Notification will be given within five days, and the procedures are simple. The above two charitable initiatives are entirely borne by the bank and do not involve external fundraising.

According to the Chinese Children's Welfare Association, the association recently received continued donations from all walks of life, totaling 283,900 yuan, including 142,000 yuan further raised by Yang Pengnian, General Manager of Datong Enterprise Bank, and 80,000 yuan raised by Song Futing, Manager of Zhengtai Bank. Mr. Yang, an Executive Committee member of the association, has raised a total of 1,123,070 yuan and is still working hard to promote it. His deep concern for association affairs and his care for children are evident. In addition, Ding Boxiong, a standing committee member of the association, has been assisting in the planning of this fundraising campaign and has devoted much effort to it. He had pledged to raise 500,000 yuan, but due to the recent sharp rise in prices, the association's expenses have been enormous, far exceeding the original budget. Therefore, he has increased his pledged amount to 1 million yuan. Currently, the association has received donations exceeding 7 million yuan, plus the 1 million yuan pledged by Standing Committee Member Ding, totaling 8 million yuan. However, it is still 2 million yuan short of the 10 million yuan goal. We still hope that enthusiastic people from all walks of life will continue to generously donate large sums to contribute to this grand cause.
