### Dredging Rice Sources to Sufficiently Provide Food for the People: The National Government Adopts Emergency Measures, Allied Authorities Decide to Offer Full Cooperation

Nanjing, 15th (Central News Agency dispatch) - Recently, rice prices have skyrocketed in Nanjing, Shanghai, and other areas, causing widespread concern among the general public. The government, mindful of the difficulties, has decided to temporarily halt the procurement efforts of the Rice Control Committee and all other related organizations. Simultaneously, existing restrictions on rice movement will be lifted to open up sources and facilitate circulation. These emergency measures regarding rice are truly wise, and the public's food panic should be rationally alleviated as a result. Premier Chen of the Executive Yuan has issued an important statement on this matter, expressing his hope that officials and civilians in all regions will understand and cooperate with this initiative. Furthermore, the authorities of allied forces and embassies have also issued statements, affirming their full cooperation with the National Government's measures and their cessation of military rice procurement. The original texts of Premier Chen's statement and the statements from allied military and political authorities are recorded below:

Premier Chen of the Executive Yuan's Statement

Recently, rice prices have fluctuated dramatically. Mindful of the difficulties, the government is implementing the following emergency measures: The rice procurement efforts of the Rice Control Committee and all other related organizations are temporarily suspended. Existing restrictions on rice movement are immediately lifted. The purpose of this is to open up sources and allow free circulation, ensuring a steady supply of rice to meet the needs of the people during this lean period. The success of any policy relies on the cooperation of all parties. Anyone found violating government directives by extorting, obstructing, or engaging in speculative hoarding will be severely punished. We sincerely hope that officials, civilians, and military personnel in all regions will understand and fulfill their respective duties to achieve the goal of stabilizing people's livelihoods.

Statement from the Allied Forces Authorities

The National Government, recognizing the current sharp rise in rice prices, has decided to halt the rice procurement efforts of the Rice Control Committee and other organizations and to remove restrictions on rice movement in the Central China region, thereby promoting free and smooth rice circulation. In response to these policies of the National Government, our military authorities are also suspending all forcibly supported procurement of military rice for this year. We will further provide special assistance to ensure the smooth flow and transportation of rice for civilian consumption. We will also fully cooperate with the National Government in cracking down on illegal taxation and speculative hoarding. Furthermore, the military will release as much wheat and other grains as possible from our holdings in the interior to the Shanghai area to support civilian distribution. All of the above aims to provide a smooth supply of rice for civilian consumption and to stabilize rice prices. We are offering full support to the National Government's policies and hope that both Chinese and Japanese officials and civilians will understand and cooperate to the fullest extent to ensure the concrete realization of these policies and achieve perfect results.

Statement from the Embassy Authorities

The National Government has issued emergency rice policies during this lean period. The rice procurement efforts of the Rice Control Committee and all other related organizations are temporarily suspended, and restrictions on rice movement are lifted. The government has also declared that those who violate these policies will be severely punished. The Chinese Expeditionary Forces are also responding to this by halting military rice procurement and transferring wheat and other grains in military storage to the general public for distribution. They have also issued a statement affirming their full cooperation with the Chinese government's policies. This move is a timely measure given the current urgent rice situation in Central China. Japanese residents in China should understand the spirit of the statements issued by Premier Chen of the Executive Yuan and the Chinese Expeditionary Forces authorities, cooperate with rice circulation, and avoid any actions that violate these policies. In light of the current state of the Greater East Asia War, it is imperative that Japanese and Chinese military and civilians are sincerely united and advance towards the goal of completion. It is a fundamental principle of our new policy towards China to share weal and woe with the Chinese people.

### Deeply Hoping Officials and Civilians Unite to Protect Rice Supplies So Panic Can Be Resolved

Nanjing, 15th (Central News Agency dispatch) - The recent sharp rise in rice prices in Nanjing and Shanghai is due to several major factors. These include the lean season, artificial speculation and manipulation, and difficulties in wartime transportation. In addition, the unsuitability of the existing rice control policies to local conditions and the failure of those responsible for grain administration to fulfill their duties are undeniable facts. The past control methods were complicated with too many procedures. Also, at each new harvest season, they failed to carry out overall planning and timely procurement, leading to various abuses. Petty individuals took the opportunity to exploit their public positions for private gain, enriching themselves. As a result, procurement efforts were ineffective, and they were unable to regulate supply during the lean season, leaving them to helplessly watch. In addition, the imbalance in military and civilian rice procurement is also a major cause of today's rice panic. Now, the government authorities, mindful of the difficulties, resolutely decided to temporarily suspend the procurement efforts of the Rice Control Committee and all other related organizations, lift the restrictions on rice movement, and allow free procurement, transport, and circulation. At the same time, allied military and political authorities are offering full cooperation to the National Government's measures and ceasing military rice procurement. They are even releasing the wheat and other grains they had already purchased in the Shanghai area for distribution to the public. The authorities' policies are truly wise and demonstrate their utmost concern for the stability of people's livelihoods. It is believed that after these emergency measures, the speculators will inevitably take the opportunity to run rampant and hoard supplies. In addition to urging them to reflect on their actions, we hope that officials and civilians will jointly monitor and crack down on these activities. We also hope that allied merchants in China will understand the importance of cooperation between China and Japan and provide full cooperation. All groups, businesses, and other organizations must not exploit the convenience of liberalization to engage in disguised large-scale purchases that disrupt the public's food supply. Local authorities in the producing areas must not restrict the flow of rice under the pretext of local needs to pursue personal gain. The general public should also share the difficulties of the times and avoid large-scale storage, which will only fuel panic and give speculators opportunities.

### Chen Binhe Goes to Nanjing to Discuss the Food Situation, Represents Shanghai Citizens to Petition the Government

Nanjing, 15th (Central News Agency dispatch) - Recently, rice prices in Nanjing and Shanghai have skyrocketed to unprecedented levels, causing great anxiety among the general public. Chen Binhe, a member of the Shanghai Municipal Advisory Committee, made a special trip to Nanjing from Shanghai on the 15th to petition the central authorities on behalf of all the citizens of Shanghai and to jointly seek solutions to the food problem.

### Japan Unites Nationally, Displaying Fighting Spirit: Prime Minister Suzuki Clarifies the Path to Victory

Tokyo, 15th (Central News Agency dispatch) - Japanese Prime Minister General Suzuki met with a group of reporters at the Prime Minister's official residence on the 14th to explain the Japanese government's determination and strategy in dealing with the war situation, as reported in yesterday's dispatch. Detailed information is provided below:

Question: What winning strategies does the government have for dealing with the serious homeland decisive battle?

Answer: At this parliamentary session, I stated that the Battle of Okinawa had entered an unfavorable state, but I only mentioned "unfavorable" without clarifying the future situation. I am confident that the loss of Iwo Jima and the unfavorable situation in Okinawa are not actually matters for grief. In the course of a sustained war, victories and defeats are natural occurrences. The outcome of a war cannot be judged lightly based on the occupation of a single location. Even if Okinawa is lost, future battles may involve landings in Kyushu or other parts of the homeland. However, if we maintain a strong fighting spirit and display a will to fight, we will force the enemy to use even more troops. Such a battle will inevitably be prolonged, and the enemy will feel that the long war is not worth the losses and will seek a ceasefire. Therefore, I do not want to merely focus on the Battle of Okinawa and weaken the nation's fighting spirit.

Question: The Prime Minister has stated that the closer the enemy gets to the homeland, the more advantageous it is for us. May I ask what the specific policy is? Also, I wonder if there has been any change in your view of the war situation since you formed the cabinet?

Answer: As long as the morale of the nation is high, I have absolute confidence in victory. The enemy cannot land a million troops in one fell swoop; they can only land in succession. Landing 500,000 troops requires several months, and considerable preparations are needed for supplies. The US military landed a large number of troops in France in Europe, but the US troops only had to cross the narrow English Channel to land in France. The distance from the United States to the Japanese mainland is incomparable to that in Europe. The enemy knows this is very difficult. Even if they land, we have considerable defenses and can mobilize a large army. In short, if the enemy comes from the sea, we will attack and reduce their transport ships at sea. If the enemy approaches the coast, we will annihilate them on the coast. If they actually land, we will certainly annihilate them on land. We are at an advantage in terms of land-based supplies and can concentrate five to ten times the enemy's forces. This is different from past island battles. Regardless of how superior the enemy's weapons and materials are to ours, we must never feel inferior. This is the path to victory.

At this point, Prime Minister Suzuki left the reporters' questioning and issued the following statement: "Finally, I deeply feel that the current stage of the war is a gratifying matter for the nation. I have participated in the Sino-Japanese and Russo-Japanese wars. At that time, the nation held fears of national demise, but they felt it was better to fight to the death than to perish without a fight. Their morale was extremely tragic. Now, Germany has finally been defeated and collapsed. But I ask, have the German people thoroughly understood the Nazi spirit? Did the German army fight with the Nazi spirit? No. The evidence is that there were no officers in the army who died gloriously. This is completely different from us. In the battles of Kiska Island and Iwo Jima, our army, whether officers or soldiers, fought to the death. The difference between the German and Japanese people, and between the German and Japanese armies, is significant. Therefore, comparing Japan to Germany is a great mistake. Germany, with such a large army, ultimately could not fight to the end. It was truly unexpected for Japanese soldiers. It is true that we may be inferior to the enemy in terms of quantity. However, once we are on the battlefield, we have a strong determination. This is a characteristic of the Japanese people. We will unite the entire nation and fight to the end with this potential."

Editorial

### Supporting Emergency Rice Measures

The central authorities of the National Government, in light of the recent sharp rise in rice prices in various regions and the serious threat to people's livelihoods, have decided to implement emergency measures: First, the rice procurement work of the Rice Control Committee and all other related organizations is temporarily suspended. Second, the existing restrictions on rice movement are immediately lifted. In response to these emergency measures, Premier Chen of the Executive Yuan issued a sincere statement, pointing out that the purpose of this move is to open up rice sources so that rice can circulate freely. He hoped that rice could continue to be supplied to meet the needs of the people during the lean season, to achieve the goal of stabilizing the people's livelihood.

At the same time, the Allied Forces and Embassy authorities have also issued statements expressing full cooperation with the National Government's emergency measures. The dispatched military authorities, in order to respond to this initiative, will cease the purchase of military rice for this year. Further, the wheat and grains which have already been purchased inland will be released in Shanghai for civilian needs. On the other hand, special assistance will be provided for the transport and movement of rice for civilian consumption, and illegal taxation and hoarding will be jointly cracked down on.

We express our admiration for the wise measures taken by the Central China authorities and the enthusiastic cooperation of the Allied authorities, and we would like to make the following statements on the significance and impact of this measure:

The reasons for the recent rise in rice prices are the unreasonableness of the purchase method in the rice producing areas and the obstruction of sources in the non-rice producing areas. The emergency measures implemented by the authorities now are to stop the purchase and lift the restrictions on the movement of rice, which are completely targeted at the crux of the problem, prescribing the right medicine. We firmly believe that after these measures are taken, the reasons for the high rice prices will be eliminated, and the sources of rice will be dredged, and rice prices will stabilize and return to normal. In our editorial the day before yesterday, we hoped that the people would not panic too much about the soaring rice prices, because the recent rice price increase is unreasonable. As long as emergency countermeasures are quickly planned and the right medicine is prescribed, at least the unreasonable surge in rice prices can be stopped. Now that the authorities have implemented the measures and received the cooperation of the Allied authorities, the unreasonable rice price surge will inevitably tend to ease and then fall. At the same time, the general price increase caused by the rice price will also tend to stabilize due to the rice price stabilization. Therefore, the people's mentality can be stabilized from now on.

Now that rice purchases have been suspended in the rice-producing areas, the sources of rice in the non-rice-producing areas can be continuously supplied. The lifting of the movement restriction can also allow free movement and smooth operation. On the one hand, the sources have a way, and on the other hand, the movement is unrestricted, so the supply and demand can be adjusted. Our city's food supply is originally taken from the nearby rice producing areas. We hope that the relevant parties will take the responsibility of assisting and supervising the rice sources as soon as possible. Especially for the transport, it is particularly needed. Military personnel are not allowed to delay or demand rice movement, but should protect it at any time. Hoarding for speculation should be strictly guarded against. In short, all parties should work towards the goal of dredging sources and suppressing rice prices to achieve the purpose of solving food problems and stabilizing people's livelihood.

At the same time, we must also recognize the reality that the current period is a lean season. Even the surplus rice in the rice-producing areas may not be sufficient to meet the needs of all the non-rice-producing areas. Therefore, we reiterate that everyone should change the mentality of not eating rice and try to use miscellaneous grains. The allied authorities have stated that they will release the purchased wheat and grains in Shanghai, but we still hope that the authorities will plan to purchase the remaining grains from Huaihai to enrich the food sources of Shanghai citizens in many ways.

Finally, we deeply hope that officials and civilians will work together to solve the pain of the food problem in one fell swoop under the emergency measures of the authorities. However, in principle, it is unavoidable to implement economic control policies during wartime. Therefore, rice control is also unavoidable. The current temporary suspension of purchases and the lifting of movement restrictions are indeed emergency measures. We are determined to learn from the pain and must consider our inherent national conditions and public sentiment in the technology of future rice control and general economic control. We must take into account both military needs and civilian food needs for rice. Only with a control policy based on this meaning can we achieve the expected control benefits and effects.

### Japan is Prepared for a Decisive Battle on Its Homeland, Benefiting From Both Timing and Location

Tokyo, 15th (Central News Agency dispatch) - The battle of Okinawa, the first line of defense for a decisive battle on Japanese homeland, lasting for over two and a half months, served as a prelude for battles on the homeland. It has been half a year since B-29 bombers began air raids on the mainland from bases in the Mariana Islands. The intensity of bombings has increased recently, with major cities like Tokyo, Nagoya, and Osaka, and large segments of the population across the country, considering the airstrikes to be a regular occurrence. Battles on the homeland have ceased to be an abstract concept. This awareness has become ingrained in the daily lives of the majority of the population. The nature of the decisive homeland battle differs entirely from that of isolated island battles like Okinawa. The homeland battle can be truly called a decisive battle, and the difficulties of supply experienced in isolated island battles will no longer be a concern. The initial success of the battles has been repeatedly explained by the military, attributing it to the disruption of transportation caused by enemy air raids. Nevertheless, by concentrating the full strength of the military and the nation on the battlefield, military operations have been fully promoted. The key to determining the outcome of a battle has always been the issue of maritime supply. However, during a decisive battle on the homeland, this problem of supply disruption will inevitably shift to the enemy. The Japanese army will be able to obtain adequate combat supplies and face the formidable American army, known for its excellent preparations, with comparable forces. This is based on the experience of repeated battles. Even in the Battle of Okinawa, conducted under the unfavorable conditions of the enemy's command of the sea and air, the Japanese army destroyed three enemy army divisions in the first half and inflicted significant damage on three newly arrived Marine divisions. They are currently engaged in fierce fighting with the enemy's third wave of new troops. The valiant fighting of the Japanese army's Fujioka, Wada, and Kaga units is a recent example and is not a matter of self-satisfaction but a clear and evident fact. During the homeland battle, both the time and location will be absolutely advantageous and worry-free for the Japanese army. Furthermore, there will be no concerns about troop strength or supplies. They will firmly defend the divine land with the great mission of protecting the country, with the construction of an inevitably victorious position for the entire population, and await the day of annihilation with Japanese soldiers and the united spirit of the people, and the anticipation of annihilating the enemy in one fell swoop is quite promising.

### B-29s Bomb Osaka Yesterday

### Hand-to-Hand Combat on Okinawa Island, Enemy Eager to Expand Air Bases

Ryukyu Islands Base, 15th (Central News Agency dispatch) - The rainy season has begun in the Ryukyu Islands, and the weather on the 13th was still very bad. Neither Japanese nor American forces could launch air operations. The land battles on Okinawa Island continue day and night, with hand-to-hand combat. Although the enemy's forces are strong, the Japanese army's will to fight remains strong.

Okinawa Base, 15th (Central News Agency dispatch) - The enemy is eager to expand or build new air bases on Okinawa due to the favorable progress of the battle. There are currently ten airfields in enemy hands: the North, Central, and Ie Island airfields, as well as the South Airfield (north of Naha), the Ojima Airfield, and the other five air bases at Onna, Yonabaru, Okuuma, Aoze, and Gushikawa. Some of these have been completed, while others are actively undergoing final construction. The South Airfield and Ojima Airfield are using existing facilities, while the other five air bases are newly built. They have been hastily constructed in the past week. The enemy is transporting materials with a large number of large transport planes to the existing North Airfield and Ie Island Airfield to expand the airfield facilities. The Ie Island airfield has completed three fully paved runways of 2,000 meters. B-24 aircraft are currently very active at the North and Central airfields. In addition, many B-24 and B-17 aircraft have been transferred from Europe to the Philippines. This enemy activity deserves serious attention.

### Situation in Burma

Burma Front Base, 15th (Central News Agency dispatch) - The enemy forces in the Toungoo area are gradually reorganizing and attempting to move south. Since late May, they have launched attacks on Japanese positions northeast of Toungoo. Enemy forces, with considerable strength, have gathered at Kuntawun (30 kilometers northeast of Toungoo) in an attempt to coordinate with the enemy forces south of Taguga, a river along the Toungoo-Kyaukme road, to encircle and penetrate Japanese positions. On the 4th, Japanese units surrounding Kalaw ambushed approximately 500 enemy soldiers with tanks, inflicting heavy casualties on the enemy, who abandoned approximately 100 bodies and halted their advance. In the areas of Loilem and Kunhing, enemy planes numbering approximately 30 have attacked Japanese positions daily since late May, providing cover with mortars and rocket launchers. However, Japanese units in the area have repeatedly engaged in close-quarters combat, forcing the enemy to retreat.

### China Mainland: Preparing for War

Tokyo, 15th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - During the recent Diet session, Army Minister Anami mentioned the mainland war situation, stating: The enemy is transferring the American-equipped Chongqing army from Burma to the Kunming and Zhijiang areas, and the enemy forces on the Pinghan Railway are also preparing for mainland operations. The military authorities are actively preparing for this. He further explained the trends on the mainland front, stating that, according to a Chongqing broadcast on June 6th, the US military command stationed in Chongqing announced that the 475th Infantry Regiment of the 1st Marine Division and the 124th Cavalry Regiment had been airlifted from Burma to the Chinese front in May. Furthermore, the newly formed 6th Army 2nd Division of the Chongqing army was airlifted from Burma to the front lines in western Hunan Province near Zhijiang in April, adopting a counter-offensive posture with the Chongqing army in that area. The enemy forces on the mainland front have been unusually active recently due to land transportation via the Stilwell Road. He Yingqin, the Chongqing Commander-in-Chief, and US General Mark Clark inspected the Hunan front in May and the Guangxi front in mid-June. During the Sixth Plenary Session of the Chongqing government in May, resolutions were passed to strengthen the Chongqing army and promote its modernization. The various war zone commander operational meetings held by the central government all indicate their strategy to rapidly realize a general counter-offensive in the southwest. Since the Chongqing army's defeat in the Xiang-Gui campaign last year, they have begun to rebuild their military strength for the war of resistance in order to open the Stilwell Road. They have successively gathered the Chongqing army in Burma in Yunnan, and transferred Tang Enbo's army from the First War Zone to Yunnan. The vast area from Hunan through Guizhou to Yunnan is divided into four front armies—First, Second, Third, and Fourth—under the command of Commander-in-Chief He Yingqin, stationing the armies of Tang Enbo, Wei Lihuang, Lu Han, and Zhang Fakui. They intend to transform approximately ten divisions of their troops into American-equipped units, actively preparing for a counter-offensive. Currently, the Chongqing army has thirty divisions of central government direct line troops stationed around Kunming. Direct line troops are also stationed in the western Xiang-Gui area, the Shaanxi area, and the Chongqing area. Gu Zhutong's army, affiliated with the central government, and miscellaneous troops with lower combat effectiveness are stationed in southeastern East China. Furthermore, the 100,000 youths recruited through the Knowledgeable Youth Enlistment Movement have been formed into ten divisions, and these troops are stationed in the Kunming, Chongqing, and Hanzhong areas. Currently, the American-equipped Chongqing army includes the newly formed 1st Army in Burma and the newly formed 6th Army, which is currently being moved. Moreover, according to a report from the Chongqing Associated Press, the Chongqing side will announce an air force expansion plan. The content has already been decided to form eleven squadrons of fighter bombers with Chinese pilots and bombardiers who have received thorough training in the United States over the past two weeks. These squadrons will be stationed at bases other than the US Air Force's 14th Air Force stationed in Chongqing, in order to carry out close cooperative operations. Due to the strong power of the Japanese army and the persistent encroachment of the Yan'an army, the Chongqing side has deployed its direct line troops in the rear. However, whether they can, as the United States hopes, rise up and undertake the heavy responsibility of flanking the Japanese mainland field army with a powerful blow through active action is highly doubtful. Nevertheless, they are actively developing the Stilwell Road, training 7,000 Chinese automobile drivers, expanding the road network, and laying the China-India oil pipeline, in order to strengthen the transportation between China and India and to complete the armament of the Chongqing army with its vast military supplies. As the European war comes to an end and the attacks on Japan intensify, the mainland front is gradually becoming tense. The Japanese Expeditionary Force in mainland China is also quietly waiting for the opportune moment to strike a decisive blow against the enemy forces.

Regardless of the outcome of this war, one thing remains certain: the ultimate goal of the Indian people is "Freedom for the Indian People." Our goal is in Delhi. Although today's international situation is difficult to predict, we must strive to advance and realize the goal of returning to Delhi in the shortest possible time. This is the consistent goal of the Provisional Government of Free India, from top to bottom.

The proposals regarding civil affairs, Baojia system, finance, construction, education, and the issue of increasing the treatment of public officials and teachers were thoroughly discussed in detail and successfully passed. The meeting adjourned at 7:00 PM. The director and deputy director of the County Administration Office hosted a banquet for all the attendees.

Director's Address

The director of the County Administration Office said in his opening address: The counties and districts under the jurisdiction of Shanghai Special Municipality include the seven counties of Nanhui, Fengxian, Shenjiang, Chuansha, Jiading, Chongming, and Baoshan, and the five suburban districts of Jiangwan, Hubei, Huxi, Pudong South, and Pudong North. These counties and districts are the periphery of Shanghai Special Municipality. In terms of land area, they cover approximately 2,580 square kilometers, accounting for 90% of the entire city and about twenty times the size of the urban area. In terms of population, they have a total of more than 2.1 million people, accounting for one-third of the city and less than half the population of the urban area. From this, it can be seen that although the population of each county and district is small, the land area is very large. Therefore, the administrative work of each county and district has an ignorable position in the overall administration of Shanghai Special Municipality. Regarding the departments of administrative work in each county and district, including civil affairs, the Baojia system, police affairs, security, finance, economy, production, construction, education, society, etc., during the period when Secretary-General Luo concurrently served as director, he had already formulated and promulgated the Outline for Strengthening County Administration, ordering its implementation. Everyone should actively proceed in accordance with the regulations, in order to strengthen the implementation. In the current environment, the Mayor and Secretary-General have further instructed that the focus of county and district administrative work is to rectify discipline, ensure security, levy grain taxes in kind, and increase production. All the work stipulated in these outlines for strengthening county administration and the key points are the responsibility of the county government to implement, the responsibility of the Administrative Supervisory Commissioner's Office to supervise, and the responsibility of the County Administration Office to provide comprehensive guidance. We should all obey the instructions of the Mayor and Secretary-General, work together, and advance in step with one heart and one mind. The purpose of this County and District Administrative Meeting convened by the County Administration Office is to bring together the leaders, supervisors, and implementers of county and district administrative work, as well as the relevant heads of the Security Command and the Municipal Government, to jointly study the direction of implementation, in order to make contributions. We hope that everyone will unite and express their opinions openly and honestly.

Mayor's Instructions

Secretary-General Luo delivered instructions on behalf of the Mayor, briefly stating: Regarding the implementation of county administration, the Outline for Strengthening County Administration has been formulated and promulgated for implementation. Recently, Director Cai has made an inspection tour of various counties and districts. It is hoped that county administration will be further developed in the future. The matters that should be paid attention to in handling county administration have been detailed in the Outline for Strengthening County Administration, which will not be repeated here. However, there are many difficulties in the current local administrative work. I would like to put forward a few more points as goals for our efforts: First, regarding war cooperation and security work, the faster the better, and at the same time, the less unnecessary damage to the lives of the people, the better. We must not use security work as an excuse to disturb the people. We must be responsible and do our work with our own conscience. Second, the Municipal Government employs people based on fairness. Therefore, you don't have to worry about personnel matters, so as not to disturb yourselves with unnecessary concerns. You must always perform your duties within your jurisdiction and do more inspection work. In short, do what should be done, do not listen to rumors that should not be listened to, and at the same time, do not abandon your posts. Be sure to do things that are beneficial to the people. The County Magistrate is an official responsible for defending the territory. He must strictly abide by the Ming training of being responsible for defending the territory. In addition, there is an urgent need to rectify the police. The collection of grain taxes in kind is also an important task. I hope that the County Magistrates will handle and promote it diligently in accordance with the regulations. If there are difficulties in the local area, you can submit a request to the Municipal Government for approval at any time.

### In the Event of a Power Outage, Measures to Supplement Water Supply are Being Actively Planned by the Construction Bureau

The Municipal Construction Bureau has recently made active and effective plans for the water supply and sanitation facilities for citizens, fearing that the current may be interrupted by air raids. In order to clarify the recent progress of the bureau, the reporter visited Director Xu and asked various questions, which he answered one by one. The following is a record:

Digging Public Wells

(Question) If the city encounters an air raid and the current is interrupted, making it impossible to supply tap water, what remedial measures does your bureau have? (Answer) In addition to encouraging and guiding the public to automatically dig earth wells as soon as possible in the event of an interruption of tap water, the bureau is now planning to dig twenty large public wells in areas far from rivers. The Municipal Government has approved it, and contractors can be invited to start construction in the near future. Recently, many citizens have dug earth wells, but the construction is sloppy, resulting in water quality that is often turbid and unsuitable for drinking. In order to promote and guide this, the bureau has prepared illustrations for digging wells for the public to consult and refer to.

Sanitation Facilities

(Question) If the power is interrupted, what measures will your bureau take for households in the city equipped with sanitary facilities, which cause sewage to clog due to the inability to supply tap water?

(Answer) This problem is also very serious. The bureau had originally planned to equip each water pumping station and Lianqing plant with its original motor, and equip it with a generator to drive the pump to pump water.

(Question) I wonder how much funding this plan will require?

(Answer) There are three sewage Lianqing plants in the city, east, west, and north, and there are about twenty or more other large and small pumping stations. If all of them are added and retrofitted with self-contained generators, the estimated cost will be more than 500 million yuan, which I am afraid the municipal treasury cannot afford.

(Question) How long will the retrofit take?

(Answer) Design and drawing will take more than a month. The installation and horsepower size of each pumping station are not uniform, and detailed calculations and designs are required. The installation project will take more than three months to complete.

(Question) Can this plan be realized?

(Answer) After retrofitting with a self-contained generator, if the power company's current is interrupted, it can work as usual, but the fuel for the generator is mainly diesel. At present, it is very difficult to purchase this type of oil, and the retrofitting project is huge and time-consuming. If the city's roads are suddenly attacked by air raids, and the sewage pumping pipes are blocked or destroyed, the pumping work will still be suspended. Therefore, this plan is not a fundamental solution.

Stop Application

(Question) Has your bureau made any other countermeasures for this?

(Answer) If the pumping work is suspended, the sanitary facilities of the households must be stopped immediately to prevent sewage from overflowing. In order to prepare for the worst, we can only advise the public to prepare wooden, porcelain, or metal toilets as soon as possible for emergencies.

(Question) But how will the cleaning work be handled?

(Answer) This point is related to the work of the Health Bureau and should be connected with the Health Bureau to strive for a proper response.

### This City's Household Flour Is Determined to Be Rationed on Schedule, the Production of Bran Is Reduced, but the Rationing Is As Usual

In order to supplement the shortage of food for the people, the Flour and Wheat Control Committee still actively maintains the original control policy for the work of unified collection and distribution of flour and wheat under this very difficult situation. Therefore, the rationing of household flour in this city is still being urged on schedule. According to news from the Shanghai District Flour and Wheat Distribution Office, the amount of flour rationed to households in this city will be reduced from two shi jin per person to one shi jin due to the difficulty of purchasing wheat and the reduced production of bran, in order to maintain the livelihood of the common people. Now that the price of rice is soaring, the demand for flour from the public is even more urgent. Although the quantity of household flour rationed cannot be increased, the original situation will be absolutely maintained in recent months and will not be delayed. We will do our best to suppress the rationing price and prevent it from increasing.

### Fifth Anti-Aircraft Training Holds Enrollment Ceremony

The Anti-Aircraft Training Institute held by the City Anti-Aircraft Headquarters held an enrollment ceremony for the fifth class of trainees yesterday (the 15th). A total of more than two hundred trainees attended this class. Director of Education Otani reported on the number of new students and the curriculum for this class. Then, Honorary Director of Education Gu was invited to give instructions: work hard, endure hardship, contribute yourself to society, and serve society. His words were earnest. After the guests delivered their speeches, the ceremony was completed.

### Price Evaluation Committee Negotiates to Strengthen Parity Price

The prices of goods in this city have soared in the last two weeks, all because of speculative merchants manipulating and hoarding goods to stimulate people's hearts and affect social and economic stability, which is truly not a trivial matter. The City Price Evaluation Committee convened a meeting in late last month to discuss the retail price limits for major and minor commodities. It was originally scheduled to convene an evaluation meeting again in early this month to make a final decision. However, the recent drastic changes in commodity prices have been more severe. The market prices in the morning and evening are vastly different. If a price limit is set once, and the various industries cannot comply with it, the effectiveness of the implementation will not be thorough, which will hinder the promotion of administration. Therefore, the Price Evaluation Committee is currently contacting all relevant parties in order to have a sufficient supply of goods and achieve the effect of strengthening the suppression of prices.

### Money Industry Increases Handling Fee

In view of the fact that the money shop's ratio has been allowed to be increased by five cents from the date of settlement on the 16th of this month, for a total of two jiao. The industry's various shop handling fees (that is, ticket subsidies) were set at a maximum of six jiao per thousand yuan at the end of last year, but at present, prices have risen sharply and expenses have increased daily. Therefore, the application of the various association shops has also been approved, and it has been decided that from this month onwards, the various shops will change the maximum amount of the handling fee to one yuan per thousand yuan, and have been notified to the various shops to comply.

### Bill Discounting Becomes More Aggravated

The practice of discounting bills, checks, and remittance slips in this city has recently become more aggravated, and the increase in the discount rate is especially alarming. It is reported that on the day before the Dragon Boat Festival and on the day of the festival, the bill discount rate suddenly jumped from one jiao and one jiao two fen to two jiao five fen. Although it has gradually decreased slightly yesterday, it is still in the range of one jiao three, four, and five fen. The authorities have not severely cracked down on this illegal profit, and the discounting has become an open secret. The most noteworthy thing is that most of the cash used for discounting is new cash in its original packaging. It is not difficult to immediately determine the whereabouts of the new banknotes that various banks and money shops obtain from the Central Reserve Bank of Shanghai every day. It is beyond the capacity of maintaining the bill credit system that should be guaranteed for the needs of adjusting the market by bill circulation. How can we arbitrarily collect bills for discounting profits, disrupt finance, and exploit the public? We sincerely hope that the Standing Committee will immediately crack down on this and thoroughly investigate its source, and give separate punishments to serve as a warning to others.

### Central District Vocational Youth Selected for Training

The First District Headquarters Central District Office of the Shanghai Youth League, since appointing Zhao Erchang to preside over the office affairs, has been formally established and has commenced operations, actively promoting youth movement work in the central district. According to the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, a letter has been received from the Shanghai Youth League Headquarters requesting assistance in hosting vocational youth cadre training in the Central District Office. The Chamber of Commerce has already sent letters to its affiliated trade guilds and other entities, requesting them to select outstanding youth for training.

### Deputy Director Man's Report: Overview of Police Administration Implementation; Attends Press Conference to Answer Questions

The Municipal Propaganda Office held a press conference at 10:30 AM yesterday (the 15th) in the Municipal Government Conference Room. Man Qiwei, Deputy Director of the Municipal Police Bureau, attended to answer various questions. More than ten reporters from various newspapers were present. Deputy Director Man first elaborated on the recent implementation of police administration, as follows:

Recent Overview of Police Administration Implementation

Since Director Zhou assumed office, various measures have been implemented to refresh the agency, adjust personnel, improve compensation, and rectify police discipline. A report was presented at the press conference on March 31st. The latest measures taken by the bureau are briefly outlined below:

Strengthening Air Defense to Minimize Damage from Enemy Raids: To strengthen air defense work and eliminate damage to citizens during air raids, the bureau is actively conducting air defense training for citizens, strengthening various air defense equipment, strictly cracking down on violations of air defense regulations, and supervising citizens to promptly build simple air raid shelters and dig anti-aircraft [Missing Information] and water [Missing Information] to meet urgent needs.

Seriously Managing Entertainment Venues to Prevent Illegal Elements from Infiltrating: If entertainment venues are not properly managed, they can easily become breeding grounds for vice, harming public morals and security. Management regulations have been issued and enforced, strictly prohibiting overtime operation to maintain public safety and conserve electricity.

Intensifying Traffic Management for the Convenience of Travelers: Poor traffic order can easily lead to various disasters. To maintain traffic order, personnel have been dispatched to various jurisdictions to inspect and strictly crack down on various vehicles with faulty lights and sound control equipment. In addition, the bureau has worked with the Municipal Construction Bureau to revise the Municipal Land Traffic Management Regulations, which have been approved for implementation. A vehicle inspection team has been established by the responsible department to ensure effective enforcement, improve order, and provide convenience for travelers.

Strengthening Public Security with a Two-Pronged Approach: Shanghai's convenient transportation and high concentration of refugees have a profound impact on public security. To strengthen public security and address the root causes, the bureau has ordered all sub-bureaus and teams to strengthen vigilance to prevent criminal cases. At the same time, vagrants, beggars, hooligans, and repeat offenders who habitually commit crimes in the city are being detained and sent to the vagrant labor camp for rehabilitation and productive labor.

Seriously Investigating Narcotics to Promote National Health: The harm of narcotics is indescribable. To promote national health and engage in production, the bureau has instructed subordinates to intensify the investigation and suppression of narcotics. Recently, a number of large-scale narcotics cases have been cracked, and the individuals involved have been transferred to the District Prosecutor's Office and the Municipal Garrison Headquarters for legal action. Greater efforts will be made in the future to eradicate the atmosphere of narcotics and relieve the people from their suffering.

Expanding Crime Prevention Publicity to Reduce Criminal Incidents: Rising prices and increasingly difficult living conditions make it easier for those who do not engage in production to fall into the abyss of crime, which greatly affects public security. It is imperative to awaken citizens to jointly prevent crime and cooperate in maintaining public safety. Therefore, the bureau has established a Crime Prevention Publicity Committee, inviting prominent figures from all walks of life to serve as members, to expand crime prevention publicity and reduce the occurrence of criminal incidents.

Promoting Economic Administration to Stabilize People's Livelihood: In recent months, prices have soared. While the lack of material sources is a factor, hoarding by merchants is also an important reason. To promote the current economic policy, the bureau will vigorously report and crack down on those who hoard materials [Missing Information] law [Missing Information] so as to suppress prices and stabilize people's livelihood.

Training Baojia Personnel to Cooperate in Maintaining City Security: In the past, Baojia personnel received appropriate training to assist military and police work, which achieved satisfactory results. Training is now being actively intensified to further cooperate in maintaining city security.

Improving Firefighting Work: Under the wartime system, the importance of firefighting work is self-evident. To meet urgent needs, the bureau has appropriately adjusted and strengthened key cadres of the fire department and replenished firefighting equipment to enable them to display a spirit of selflessness and fulfill their firefighting and rescue duties.

Standardizing Uniforms for Officers: The bureau was formed by merging the former First, Second, and Third Police Bureaus, resulting in varied uniform styles. Although repairs have been made, the uniforms remain inconsistent, which is not only unaesthetic but also affects the appearance of the police force. This year's summer police uniforms will follow the styles stipulated by the National Government and will be uniformly made and distributed by the bureau to achieve standardization and enhance the appearance.

Improving Police Welfare: With the recent sharp rise in prices, the salaries and allowances of officers are disproportionate. To stabilize the lives of personnel, free rice rations are being expedited, and the [Missing Information] Police Welfare Society is procuring daily necessities as much as possible, which are then sold to the bureau's officers and policemen at [Missing Information] prices, so that their current living conditions can be alleviated and their service spirit can continue to be promoted.

Expanding the Police Hospital: Since taking over the Police Hospital, the bureau has made every effort to recruit highly skilled medical personnel and actively replenish equipment and medicines to ensure the health of all officers. When necessary, the hospital will also undertake the work of diagnosis and treatment for citizens.

Rewarding Outstanding Officers and Policemen: To encourage officers and policemen to work even harder, the bureau instructed the heads of each unit last month to closely review their subordinates and list those with outstanding achievements. After verification, they were promoted this month to demonstrate encouragement.

Strengthening Police Education: The quality of the police force depends on the emphasis placed on education. To cultivate exemplary police officers, in addition to providing supplementary education to existing officers, the bureau is strengthening the education at the police training school, inviting outstanding instructors, and expanding educational equipment. Trainees are subjected to rigorous training, and the quality of the police force is improving daily.

The above are only a few of the policy outlines. There are many areas that need improvement. We hope that colleagues in the press and people from all walks of life will cooperate with the bureau so that under the leadership of Director Zhou, we can use our blood and sweat to ensure Shanghai's peace and security, enhance the welfare of citizens, and fulfill the wartime mission of the police.

Absolutely Eliminate Nanguo Red Flower

Questions Raised by Various Newspapers: To save electricity and adapt to the wartime system, the municipal authorities have restricted the business hours of various industries, especially entertainment venues, strictly prohibiting them from operating overtime. However, Nanguo and Red Flower coffee shops are still operating all night. Does the police bureau intend to crack down on them? Deputy Director Man answered: The police strictly manage the operating hours of entertainment venues, with regulations stipulating penalties for operating overtime. Some nightclubs have already voluntarily closed down. As for Nanguo and Red Flower coffee shops, which disregard the law and still operate overnight, they will be absolutely cracked down on and ordered to operate according to the prescribed hours. Violations will be severely punished.

Striving to Improve the Treatment of Officers and Policemen

Regarding the issue of the treatment of officers and policemen, Deputy Director Man replied: Since Director Zhou assumed office, improvements have been made repeatedly, such as providing free rice rations, and efforts are being made to [Missing Information]. A request has also been submitted to increase salaries and allowances in order to stabilize the lives of officers and policemen.

### Donation for the Yuyao Road Fire Completely Allocated

When the Association held a warrant and sent someone to collect, this newspaper issued a check from the Fuxing Bank, which was given to them to take back, fully allocating all remaining funds.

Encouraging Broadcast Donations

Since the Buddhist Benevolent Society assisted the Temporary Relief Association in constructing the Yuyao Road Civilian Village, it has been doing its best to encourage donations and start construction. Unexpectedly, the prices of labor and materials have recently soared dramatically, increasing to 600,000 to 700,000 yuan per room, so the total amount is very different. In addition to appealing to all walks of life, the Buddhist Benevolent Society has received sponsorship from Lan Ting, Lin Kanghou, Li Zanhou, and Yuan Lidun, and has invited all the famous Shanghai opera singers of the Daguan Yaji to hold a Peking opera broadcast on Huangpu Radio on the 20th of this month (Wednesday) from 6:00 PM to 12:00 AM.

### Basic Education Lecture Series Conducts a "Charity School Bookmark Campaign": Report

In April of this year, the newspaper organized a volunteer education committee to establish ten volunteer primary schools. The enrollment of students was completed in a few days. At that time, in addition to slightly expanding the enrollment of each school, we were unable to increase the number of classes due to financial and material constraints. Recognizing that education is a century-long plan that is crucial to the future of the nation, the colleagues of the Basic Education Lecture Series, under the premise of "rescuing out-of-school children," initiated and promoted the "Charity School Bookmark Campaign" with a target of 2,000,000 yuan. The method was to donate 50 yuan for volunteer school funding and give away a beautiful bookmark as a souvenir. At that time, we wished to not only raise the aforementioned target amount of volunteer school funding, but also to awaken the interest and attention of society to volunteer education. We believe that education is part of the entire social undertaking. Only when all sectors of society work together can it be successful. Since the start of the bookmark promotion, we have received enthusiastic support from members of the community, leaders in the education sector, and students from various schools. A total of 70,331 bookmarks have been sold, with a donation of 50 yuan for each bookmark, resulting in an actual collection of 3,516,550 yuan in national currency. After deducting 304,800 yuan for printing paper, 165,375 yuan for ribbons, and 6,910 yuan for miscellaneous expenses, there remains 3,039,465 yuan (which has been handed over to the newspaper's Volunteer Education Committee for safekeeping), exceeding the target. With satisfactory results, the colleagues are very happy.

It is particularly worth mentioning that the staff involved in this charity school bookmark campaign were all current primary school teachers and volunteer primary school teachers from this newspaper. They used their free time to promote the bookmarks, collect donations, count quantities, and settle accounts, traveling east and west without complaint. In addition, the principals and teachers of various schools either supported the promotion or generously provided guidance, enabling this campaign to achieve [Missing Information] satisfactory results. We would like to express our highest respect and gratitude.

The bookmark campaign has now been completely [Missing Information] [Missing Information]. Below is a list of [Missing Information] [Missing Information] donors. It is hoped that it will be made public [Missing Information] fortune.

### A First-Hand Account of Inspecting the Kyushu Front Line

Through the kind permission of the local army ground forces, I (a reporter from the current city newspaper's reporting team) was able to inspect the first line of defense in Kyushu, responsible for defending the homeland. My first observation from this trip was the determination and confidence of the front-line troops to annihilate the enemy, which can be represented by the words of Commander Hua (translator's note: "Hua" refers to the commander). He said, "The battle to intercept the enemy in Kyushu is fundamentally different from Saipan and other locations. If the enemy attempts to invade the Kyushu mainland, they will face annihilation at sea! Moreover, even if they manage to break through the naval defenses, they will be annihilated at the water's edge. Should they be fortunate enough to land, they will be completely wiped out, leaving not a single piece of armor intact." Commander Hua's words are based on the tried-and-true fighting spirit of the soldiers and the impregnable defense works. Standing on a corner of the Kyushu fortress's front line, facing the vast ocean, and looking around, I was deeply moved and further strengthened my conviction of certain victory. Within the permitted scope, I will report the inspection process as follows.

Diligent Construction of Cave Fortifications

The first thing the troops undertook was the construction of underground fortresses. Through hard work and sweat, they painstakingly built cave fortifications and trenches that could withstand any naval gun bombardment or aerial bombing. Whenever the soldiers had free time, they diligently dug caves, dedicating their spare time outside of training to the maintenance of the fortifications. If someone was seen standing idly, they would hear the order: "Hey, go dig!" The soldiers were fighting against mud and sand even before engaging the enemy.

Construction work has been mostly completed, and daily life has moved into the caves. Now, under a grand plan, the construction of defenses continues to advance. Isn't this reminiscent of the importance placed on the Rabaul stronghold? The effort put into building cave fortifications is significant. Under the unit's motto of "thorough battlefield life," the soldiers dig day and night. One soldier, in order to fulfill his responsibility, dug for ten days without rest, eventually becoming ill. However, he refused to give up, evading the nurses' eyes and secretly sneaking into the cave, where he continued to swing his pickaxe. Other soldiers came up with new methods for transporting sand and soil, increasing efficiency threefold. In such a tense environment, the prospect of bathing or living a leisurely life is simply nonexistent.

"I haven't taken a bath in ten days! But I don't even want to," said one soldier.

Mountain Life and Forgetting the Days

"What day is it today? Living a mountain-like existence, I've even forgotten the days," one soldier grabbed me and scratched his head, asking.

Although this is the homeland, in the lives of these brave warriors, it is not the homeland but a future battlefield.

Local residents in the vicinity do not stand idly by while the soldiers work hard. They formed a labor service team, with students using surveying instruments to take measurements.

"Students are not happy when there is little 'work'!" the training officer laughed.

The forces confined to the fortifications will fully exert their power, while utilizing everything on the ground, adding various unique designs to create strong defensive works. The fortifications are not only for defending against attacks, but also act as offensive positions to fully exert the forces and fiercely attack the enemy, making the most of the art of war. "Defense must also include the sharp spirit of attack, ensuring a proactive stance." This aspect of battlefield jargon is being realized here. Moreover, close combat attacks and daring charges are the special skills of this unit. When the time comes, all officers and soldiers, led by the commander, will engage in hand-to-hand combat to fulfill the great mission of defending the homeland.

Ready to Fight and Step Forward to Face Difficulties

The training of the front-line troops is more intense than imagined, and as heroic as actual combat. These brave soldiers, eager and ready, are full of heroic spirit. From the position with the motto "Step Forward to Face Difficulties," pointing to the crucial road leading to a certain place, Commander Guo sternly said:

"The battle will come from here. But no matter what, this road will not be allowed to be crossed by enemy soldiers!"

Ah, what a strong fortress, what a commendable determination!

On the one hand, although construction work is very busy, they still manage to procure food locally, cultivating sweet potatoes and vegetables in the vast fields, which is currently underway. In addition, they are also gathering medicinal herbs such as mugwort for stopping bleeding and Coptis chinensis for treating abdominal pain.

### Completing the Mission with Death

Saying goodbye to the green and lush base, the special attack force soared into the battlefield. The feelings of its members were indeed worthy of praise and tears, but the feelings of the fighter pilots responsible for protecting them were also tragic. Ensign Tominaga (a graduate of Meiji University, residing in Arai, Tokyo) was responsible for covering the initial special attack force in the Okinawa operation, and this was his first time in combat. Recently, he told me that he had another mission three days later, and he gave me an article at the same time. That night, he left this place and flew to the forward base. The following is his article. – Written by Special Correspondent Onuma

My Mission and My Comrades' are Separate

We consider it supremely magnificent to complete the mission with death. For example, Ensign Katsuhou's plane, which I was covering, magnificently completed his mission with death. However, I cannot die in the mission of covering my comrades. I must find out the results of my comrades' battle, otherwise it would be my shame.

I received the order on April ×. The number of aircraft in the special attack force and the covering force were the same. According to reports, the enemy mobile forces were escorting a large convoy to the main island of Okinawa. The attack target of the special attack force was several transport ships. Due to various reasons, the special attack force and the covering force took off from separate bases. The commander of the special attack force was the admirable Lieutenant Shirai.

The green earth and verdant mountains were all in darkness. Only the signal lights of the base could be seen flickering. I was ordered to cover the special attack plane piloted by Ensign Katsuhou. If I had known this earlier, I would have asked him for his last words. However, even though I could not hear them, I am sure he had already told his mother before leaving his homeland. When I received the order, I was very happy and prepared to die with the enemy ships. I have nothing to say, I only felt the nobility of completing the mission with death. The night before, when I was drinking and receiving Ensign Katsuhou's belongings, I was being watched by the reporter, which made me a little embarrassed.

Flying Across the Sea to the Battlefield

Looking at the formation, one covering plane was missing, but all the special attack planes had taken off. The night had not yet dawned. Flying straight to the battlefield across the dark sea. The destination was the airspace above the enemy US ships around the Kerama Islands. We did not have to search for the location of the enemy ships, because it was night, the enemy interceptors would not fly up, and if the enemy fired anti-aircraft fire, then their position would be revealed. However, it is important to clearly distinguish between ships and islands, because it would be a disaster to head toward an uninhabited island. However, as long as we are careful, there is no problem with this. We reached our destination, and soon it began to dawn. The convoy at sea could be clearly identified.

Because the light was not strong, I could not clearly see the seat of Ensign Katsuhou's plane, I could only see the outline of the aircraft. He avoided several shells, and at a height of 〇〇 meters, he found an excellent target. He shook his wings and dived down.

"Please, please." At this time, there was a very severe impact, which turned out to be an enemy shell exploding. Ensign Katsuhou's plane corrected the nose angle and immediately crashed down. Looking at the sea under the light of the flares, there was indeed an aircraft carrier. However, Ensign Katsuhou told me that "I am crashing into a large transport ship", and did not target that aircraft carrier. This is because it is meaningless to attack the same target as another special attack plane. And our mission is to fully destroy the enemy's landing force's supplies, so he aimed at an enemy convoy.

Dying in the Mission, Living in the Mission

Dying in the mission is actually living in the mission. It is a painful thing to depart on a covering mission, witness the enemy ship in front of you and not be able to sink it, and have to return against your will. I am waiting for the day to perish with the enemy ships.

One of the comrades who took off was self-detonated, that was the plane piloted by Mr. Katsuragi. According to the ground personnel, when he took off, one of the auxiliary tanks on his plane fell off. Although they sent a telegram asking him to come back, he refused to fly back, because he believed that it would be dishonorable not to participate, so he did not plan to return alive. At that moment, he had already decided to fight the enemy ships to the death.

When I saw my comrade break in, I also decided to follow him down. However, my mission is not to attack, but to cover my comrades. Therefore, I had to endure. (Translated from Yomiuri Hochi)

### Map of Okinawa and Surrounding Areas

In the recent battles on Okinawa Island, the most intense fighting has taken place in the areas around Naha and Shuri in the south, as well as in 小　, 事武　, 世名城, and 一幣. In the Chinen, Tamagusuku, Tomigusuku, and Minatogawa areas of the Shimajiri district on the east coast, the two armies remain in confrontation. In order to conceal the difficulties of the battle situation, the enemy has deployed naval air forces to participate in the operation, indiscriminately carrying out bombings against the Japanese mainland and Taiwan. However, the Japanese air defense formation is as solid as a rock, and with the cooperation of the front and rear lines, the enemy mobile forces are unable to be active. Therefore, the Japanese army's grasp of future victory is even more firm.

Shanghai Municipal Political Weekly Topics

### How to Dig a Well

— Zheng Dingbang

Today, Shanghai's suffering from air raids has become an unavoidable reality, so it is imperative that citizens dig wells. This is because during air raids, various public services, such as electricity, gas, and water, are at risk of being interrupted at any time. As for electricity and water, after the electricity restrictions, there are still substitutes for electric lights, such as oil lamps, candles, and carbide lamps, which can be used as supplements. Therefore, once the power is cut off, the impact on the daily lives of citizens seems to be small, at most just inconvenient; but if the water supply is cut off, then we will undoubtedly immediately feel a serious threat and unimaginable consequences.

The drinking, washing, and fire-fighting water of Shanghai citizens has always relied on tap water, unlike the inland areas which generally have clean, fresh-tasting rivers, pools, and wells that can be used. Therefore, we must quickly dig wells to prevent any emergencies. At the same time, the current water consumption has also been reduced due to electricity savings, which has caused inconvenience in daily use. As summer approaches, water consumption will inevitably increase, so wells should be dug in time to remedy the shortage of tap water.

Many wells have indeed been dug everywhere now, but the water quality is difficult to satisfy people, because some people are greedy for cheapness and there is no one to guide and supervise them, allowing well-digging merchants to dig randomly. Some people hire well-digging merchants who have not registered with the Construction Bureau to work, resulting in poor results. This wastes manpower and resources, and does not benefit the actual situation at all.

In addition to the above-mentioned man-made reasons, geological factors are also related to the suitability of wells. This is because in Shanghai, about two meters below the ground, there are often things like mud, garbage, coal, and other things, and occasionally there are sewers and sewage pipes. If wells are dug in this kind of place and ordinary bricks and tiles are used to construct the well, then the water source will not be clean. It cannot be used for drinking or washing. Some water sources may not be turbid on the surface, but because they are dug too shallow and have limited water storage, the water will be stirred into a muddy slurry as soon as it is drawn, making it unusable. So we must pay attention to the following points to ensure that the wells we dig are suitable for drinking, washing, and fire-fighting:

The well site should be as far away as possible from toilets, ditches, or other dirty places, at least three meters away. If you encounter mud, garbage, or sewage pipes when digging, it is best to relocate and dig again, otherwise find another remedy.

The well should not be too shallow, and the depth should be at least five meters or more. If you encounter quicksand after digging to a considerable depth, it is best to relocate and dig again.

The inner wall of the well, at least the upper half, about two meters, must be constructed with impermeable materials to prevent sewage from flowing in.

After the well is completed, alum should be placed in the water to allow impurities in the water to settle to the bottom of the well.

If you need to sterilize, the easiest way is to add one part per million of bleaching powder to the water (the newer the bleaching powder, the better. There are many ways to disinfect, but some methods are not easy to do under normal circumstances).

You must hire a well-digging merchant who has registered with the Construction Bureau to carry out the work.

Now, to be more specific, here are the drawings and explanations of several types of wells:

(A) When digging a well, if you get a layer of yellow mud immediately after digging, and there are no ditches or sewage pipes passing through, then the water source of this well will probably be clean and suitable. In this case, the surroundings of the well may be built purely with concrete blocks or tiles to save costs.

(B) If it is a layer of mud or garbage immediately after digging the ground, or there is a sewage pipe passing nearby, it is best to relocate and dig again. If the location is limited, then the upper section of the well, about two meters, must be constructed with waterproof materials to prevent sewage from flowing in. The waterproof part must extend below the water surface. The waterproof part is best to use reinforced concrete and three-part soil tile pipes, but due to the current shortage of materials and high prices, one part cement, two parts yellow sand and grout can be used to build the wall, and the surface can be plastered with cement and yellow sand. The lower section can still be built with tiles or bricks.

(C) If the four walls of the well can be built entirely with waterproof materials from top to bottom, and the bottom of the well is not made of wood, but is replaced with a sand filter layer (the bottom layer is gravel, followed by fine gravel, coarse sand, and the top layer is alum or a mixture of alum and lime), such a well, no sewage will flow in from the surroundings, and the water source will only come from the yellow mud layer at the bottom of the well through the sand filter layer, then the water here will definitely be very clean and suitable.

### Municipal Advisory Council Suggests Relaxing Water Rationing

The Municipal Advisory Council of this city recently had a proposal on the issue of water rationing in this city, which has been sent to the Municipal Government for handling. Here is an excerpt:

Recently, it was reported that the water supply has been reduced by 30%. Now that summer is here, the weather is getting hotter and people naturally need more water. Water is indispensable for human life. Since the drastic price increase and rationing of tap water, citizens have had no choice but to reduce washing and conserve water, and switch to drawing water from the river or using well water. Reducing washing can hinder hygiene, and river water and well water have not been scientifically disinfected, and are likely to cause disease when drunk. At a time when rice prices are soaring, citizens are already malnourished and their resistance is very weak. How can they withstand the attack of germs in unsafe drinking water? Few will be able to avoid illness and death. Therefore, it is specially recommended that your government quickly transfer this to the Huazhong Water and Electricity Company and the French Water and Electricity Company, and order the Construction Bureau to immediately correct the situation and maintain the original summer water supply to meet the needs of citizens.

### Law and Life

— A Police Officer

A few months ago, two police officers who perverted justice were executed at the racecourse. The people of the city applauded and cheered when they heard the news. The authorities' decisive handling of this case, which demonstrated the strictness of the law, can indeed serve as a warning to others and achieve the effect of rectifying officialdom and eliminating corruption.

I, the writer of this article, am also a member of the police force. I feel immense relief at the elimination of these bad elements, but also feel boundless shame.

Since Zhou Jian took office as the director, he has focused on improving the living conditions of police personnel, using the minimum amount needed to maintain the family expenses of each officer as the standard. As a result, salaries were increased by two and a half to three and a half times, and two and a half to six *dou* of rice were distributed free of charge, as well as running welfare societies to distribute affordable daily necessities. This enabled every police officer to settle down and further commit to their duties. At the time, this treatment could indeed be called quite generous, and the police administration gradually moved onto the right track. Generally, police officers who used to be corrupt and pervert justice could restrain themselves a little.

However, now, prices are rising in a straight line, while the treatment of police officers is still the same. Compared to the prices at that time, the difference is several times higher. Therefore, the salary that was able to maintain life in the past cannot cope today. This is indeed a problem worth studying. If the livelihood of police officers cannot be maintained, they naturally cannot be loyal to their duties. Some may even disregard the law because of lack of funds, using their official positions to extort money illegally. In this way, not only can security not be maintained, but on the contrary, security will be thrown into chaos. Therefore, I hope the authorities can find a remedy for us as soon as possible, so that we can work with peace of mind and not violate the law of the authorities.

### Opinions on Air Raid Shelters - Part 1: Construction Must Be Solid

Every night on the way home, the high and low piles of mud kept slipping under my feet, that is the air raid shelter dug by the Baojia authorities.

More than a month ago, when passing Jiading Road, I saw a large crack in an air raid shelter next to the road, and it was bent. I deeply felt that the moment of the air raid shelter's support (Mcmenl) could not bear all the external force. Not to mention an air raid, even in peacetime without any external force (excluding the natural external forces such as air pressure and wind force), it would collapse in the short term.

The construction of air raid shelters is currently underway. Except for the main ones completed by the government, most have not yet been completed. Recently, each household was asked to donate a certain amount to the police defense donation by the Baojia to complete the unfinished air raid shelters. Before the construction is completed, I would like to make the following suggestions as a reference for the Baojia.

Within the possible scope, use wood as the principle for the supports in the air raid shelter. Use substitutes when necessary, but pay attention to their moment (Momenl).

Do not allow cracks or holes in the soil covering the air raid shelter.

After the air raid shelter is completed, it should be responsible for by the self-defense corps, and do not allow mischievous children to destroy it.

Pay attention to the cleanliness inside and outside the air raid shelter. (Ran Cui)

Part 2: Volume Should Not Be Too Small

The construction of air raid shelters in Shanghai is scattered everywhere to meet the needs of air defense. Now, "small air raid shelters" are being built in various neighborhoods, like the Jiu'an neighborhood, each house has to contribute 2,150 yuan, and the total amount collected is quite considerable! However, the "small air raid shelters" that I have seen are not much bigger than the Ziliu Well, like the tombs of children in the countryside, they are too small! If an emergency air strike occurs, how can everyone squeeze into the small air raid shelter?

I hope that those in charge of the matter should widen the length, and the depth should also be deepened. As for the width, since most alleys are narrow, widening the alley will hinder traffic. The width of a Eight Immortals table seems still appropriate. Secondly, before the small air raid shelter is completed, the pit has been dug, which is very dangerous! There are many children playing in the lane, and they are likely to fall into the trench and suffer serious injuries or death! I hope to cover the pit with wooden boards or straw mats, and draw red powder lines around the outside. It would be even better if a red sign with the words "Beware of Danger" could be placed there! (Luohan)

### The Problem of Charging Fees at the Municipal Library

— Fenggang

It was reported that the Municipal Public Library of this city has a move to charge a small loan fee. I am also a member of the Municipal Public Library. The library's collection of loan fees this time is in the nature of extortion. The receipt has words like "Thank you for your generous donation of one hundred yuan." The colleagues in the library are trying to supplement their income because they are having financial difficulties. Their intention is understandable, but their method is very bad.

For the present plan, the library should immediately cancel the "loan fee" method and find other legitimate ways to increase income and reduce expenditure, which would be great for poor members.

As for the ways to increase income and reduce expenditure, as far as I can see, there are the following two points:

Submit a request to the municipal government for additional funding. The library is a cultural undertaking, and it is of great importance to social education. Now that the municipal government is trying to improve the lives of primary school teachers and journalists, it should also consider the living problems of the librarians and adjust their treatment appropriately.

Cut redundant staff. There are many librarians in the library, but their work efficiency is very low. When handling borrowing and returning procedures, they often chat and laugh with each other, treating the members waiting in line as if they were invisible. If those who are not working effectively can be cut off, and their salaries can be given to those who are working hard, then efficiency can be improved and the lives of the librarians can be stabilized.

### Request to Authorities to Open the Municipal Swimming Pool

— Yiren

Recently, due to the soaring cost of living, apart from a few speculators who frequent entertainment venues for extravagant revelry, the majority of citizens feel the pain of having too few wholesome recreational opportunities. This leads us to recall the convenience and benefit that the municipal swimming pool (located at the end of North Sichuan Road) brought to the citizens when it was open last year.

We remember the emerald green water, the white-tiled pool edge, and the quiet surroundings. For one hundred yuan (which would of course be adjusted this year), one could swim, bathe, and rest the body and mind. This kind of joy is beyond the reach of those who immerse themselves in the world of wine, women, and song; rather, it is a wholesome form of recreation that citizens should enjoy and can enjoy during this wartime.

We hear that the municipal government is not preparing to open the swimming pool this year. We do not yet know the reason. We suggest that unless the swimming pool is being used for other purposes, it should be open to the public. Although this is a small matter, it is closely related to the people's love for the municipal government and the connection between the municipality and its citizens.

Finally, we hope that the rumor that the swimming pool will not be open this year is untrue.

### My Views on Establishing Free Middle Schools

— Tang Yuan

After reading Mr. Yao's article "Establishing Free Secondary and Higher Schools" in the fourteenth issue of this publication, I strongly agree with his sentiments. Today, there are countless ambitious young people who are turned away from school doors. Compulsory education is inherently the responsibility of the government and the Ministry of Education itself, and it should not be considered a form of relief. However, today's free schools are mostly founded by enthusiastic individuals and have nothing to do with the government, which is why they ultimately do not achieve significant results.

Regarding free middle schools, as far as I know, the Student Fellowship of the Shen Bao Scholarship Fund began preparing for their establishment two months ago. The person in charge was running around all day, but now I hear that it has been temporarily shelved. The biggest reason is the lack of a suitable school site. Because of this, the entire plan has come to a standstill, which is deeply regrettable.

The government fails to encourage, support, or guide existing free schools, and it fails to assist those who aspire to start them. This is why Chinese education is on the verge of bankruptcy and cannot be revitalized.

Without mincing words, establishing free secondary and higher schools is an urgent task that cannot be delayed any longer. In addition to earnestly hoping that the government and all sectors of society will actively promote it, I humbly offer a few points for the reference of enthusiastic individuals:

Within existing universities, the school authorities should establish free education classes, utilizing spare time, with education students serving as teachers, which would also provide them with practical experience. The cost would be minimal.

Within each baojia district, the baojia authorities should conduct surveys in the schools within their districts. If schools have spare time, they should establish free middle schools to provide a place for out-of-school youths in the district to continue their education. The expenses could be supported by the baojia committee or by soliciting donations from residents in the district. Since it concerns public welfare, there will surely be many donors.

Each trade association should set aside a special item in its budget to establish free middle schools to provide relief to the children of its members.

The municipal education authorities should establish free middle schools in the municipal schools.

Compulsory education should be founded by the government. However, in this day and age, with the separation of officials and the people, and with all sectors of society striving for their own welfare, there are many enthusiastic people. This great cause of saving people and the country should not end up as a flash in the pan or be abandoned halfway.

As for the curriculum content of free middle schools, it should focus on matters related to practical life. Topics that are empty or divorced from life can be temporarily omitted. The key is to enable out-of-school youths to learn what they need in the most valuable time, apply what they learn, and thus improve both their studies and their careers, indirectly promoting society forward. This is the true purpose of free middle schools.

Finally, I want to loudly appeal to people from all walks of life to work together to promote this cause, guide working youth onto the right track, help out-of-school youth to continue to improve, and universally establish free middle schools, as well as various specialized schools above the secondary level, so that every young person has the opportunity to study. Then, the future of education, the future of society, and the future of the nation will be filled with great hope.

(The editor notes: If the schools in our city are willing to generously lend or rent their school buildings to free middle schools, please write to the Shen Bao Free Education Committee. We are eagerly awaiting your response!)

### People of a Small Town

— Xia Ru

Last year, I lived in an old small town. In the late spring when fallen petals were fluttering, I went there, and just as I touched the familiar feet of spring again, I returned.

I cannot forget the people of the small town, living in an overly leisurely way of life, always obedient under the instructions of their grandmothers, but they were kind. Although there were too many temples and pagodas, cold and solemn like ancient patterns on broken porcelain vases, but standing in the sweet potato fields, listening to the sound of the dove bells passing by, people were like silhouettes pasted on a green oil painting, the dizzy high sky extending to a deeper distance.

I cannot forget the girl who grew up in lonely happiness. Every day, she came to fetch my ice bucket and filled a wooden bucket with clear water for me. Her eyes were very round, and when she smiled, it seemed that there was a teardrop rolling in the corner of her eye. The neighbor told me that she was already a fifteen-year-old girl, but she was as short as a flattened pumpkin. Standing on the earthen slope, I reached out and picked two dark purple mulberries from the crumbling wall of her house. Her eyes widened even more: "Give them back, give them back –" stubbornly holding my hand, the freckles on her nose were clearer under the evening tide. "The little girl was born in a jar, grew up in a jar, no father, no mother, the big girl is like a short-legged toad, ha, no husband's family, hey, do you want to get married?" Imitating the neighbors' teasing words, the immature girl suddenly became shy, lowered her head, and I felt a cruel smile that humiliated others, echoing. She ran away, then stopped; pouted her mouth, and threw the two mulberries she had carried back hard at my face, then laughed wildly, making faces, and jumping happily like a rabbit.

The old man was a silent grandfather, with intimidating eyes, but in the morning, he was braiding the little girl's hair outside the wood shed, his hands trembling under the tattered blue cloth short coat. How could he be strong again, having raised his son, and now having to take care of his son's daughter, and when he saw his granddaughter's sturdy, slightly protruding chest, there was a taste of illusory sadness. Was an old man's emotions like still water? No, when I left the house in front of the ancient temple, people were all saying:

A woman in her thirties or forties often appeared here at night, dark and sturdy, a beggar woman. Yesterday, when the stars were twinkling, they saw that woman like a ghost pushing into the old man's wood shed. As soon as it was light, the country people carrying manure also said that a woman walked from this path to the streets. Well, nothing else, it was hard for that little girl. I was not surprised by the primitive love of a man in his fifties, and I sadly saw the unnecessary girl in this story! Was it?

Now, I am deeply thinking about the young only son in the backyard.

Standing under the mica window rinsing my mouth, I first caught sight of his rat-like, timid eyes. With a mouthful of water, I mumbled: "Good morning!" But there was no polite reply. In the evening, going to the stove to get hot water, I saw him leaning against the door frame of the courtyard, his eyes full of the ardent desire of a woman on the eve of her marriage. He was very tall, but his arms hung down weakly. – Don't criticize someone weaker than you – he wanted to avoid me again, putting on a friendly smile, I restrained him, gently, afraid of startling the landlord's old lady's only son. That was a pious old woman who only had her Buddha and her son.

"Are you watching the moon climb up that old locust tree? Or are you waiting for the first star to appear in the sky?" Every night I heard him reading and reciting poems in a low voice, which was a more desolate sob than the sound of the night watchman's clapper in the deep night, the sound of youth being suppressed.

"No, I'm standing waiting for the lights to come on, then I'll go back to the house and sleep." Hearing his mother's slow footsteps, he stammered, the kind of joy a newly weaned child has when it sees its mother's breast again, revealed on his face, in his younger eyes. Without saying good night, he disappeared into the darkness behind the threshold, and I walked up the stone steps following that gray-haired woman, and their uneven shadows on the flagstone ground.

"A young man who will forever follow his mother to the gray grave!" I couldn't help but sigh lightly for his often taciturn and lonely expression.

I was really afraid to hear the plucking of the steel stringed zither, he loved to play "Autumn River Night Moon," sadly shaking like a widow's complaints on a misty night without stars or moon. But, who knew that under the lighted window was a life in its twenties! It was a life that needed love and hate, but it was easily locked in this deep courtyard, pinched by the hand of his dying mother.

People all thought he was the luckiest young man, with a house, land, a closet full of books, gentle and mature, but in fact, he was dying before his beloved mother's death, never thinking about the outside world, he was blessed. If he once groped in a wider world, his wings would be broken. Was he?

I am thinking of that old man selling water caltrop with his unique cry.

The small town was a water town, lotus roots and water caltrop were eaten from the dog days to mid-autumn. Outsiders who eat them would never forget the sound of the old man picking water caltrop.

The first time, the sun was still burning like charcoal fire, I was taking a nap, and was awakened by that low, hoarse voice:

"Shajiao water caltrop, hot and pure water caltrop, do you want to eat it, water caltrop –" It was strange why the peddlers along the street had such violent cries, fiercely. I opened the door and ran out to find him, he was walking with his head down, his face full of sweat.

"Forty yuan a catty, small water caltrop thirty yuan, did you hear me? My eyes are fierce and red.

"Let's make a long-term customer, big ones thirty yuan, old man!" I bargained.

"Go to hell, buy it or not you. Shajiao water caltrop, hot –" So simply, he carried the wooden bucket of water caltrop away, into the deep alleys and narrow streets.

One afternoon, I strolled along the fields, walking towards his broken tile house by the pond.

"Old man, if you didn't sell me water caltrop during the day, according to my temper, I would have broken your jaw, but I love you for being so straightforward, so I came to see your old wife, and buy a few catties of fresh pond water caltrop!" I said tactfully.

"Buy water caltrop then buy some, how many catties? Three catties will be fifty yuan!" He handed me the dripping wet rush bag, sat down impatiently, and smoked his dry tobacco.

I sat for the whole dusk, he ignored me, and didn't even look at me. It seemed he had discovered a miracle, he only spoke to himself, muttering to himself, intermittently.

"Hmm, let's go, what's so rare, alas, I'm going to Nantang tomorrow to buy water caltrop wholesale, it's going to rain…" His head was tilted, his eyes staring blankly, like an idiot, and covered with red threads.

Later, I learned that he was an old widower abandoned by his wife. One spring evening, his young wife secretly took the water caltrop boat in the pond, rowed to the bridge leading to Tongxian County, and ran away with the lover who was waiting.

He immersed his life in the foam of wine, in curses, in eccentric and violent monologues, he was a suffering, tormented soul. Was he?

People of the small town, I have an ideographic heart, but I lack a pair of relief hands. It was only a year, but there was love beyond profound time. If I go there again, and see them again, what kind of mood will arise?

### To

— Chunyi

Like a swallow in spring, you flew here on an accidental day, lingered only for a moment, and then fluttered away.

This place was not meant for you to stop at: how can pure birds grow in a rotten nest? How can a free lark be confined in a stuffy cage? What's more hateful is the rogue's hand that wants to snatch into the nest, the greedy mouth that laughs vulgarly into the cage! I know that this is what you cannot tolerate. You came full of hope, rejoicing in your acquisition of a job, gaining the beautiful name of independence, but in the end you realized that this was only a boring, muddled place to beg for food, this was only a "self-reliance" in the form of selling yourself! What's more, you had to hear and see countless malicious, flirtatious laughter and glances cast at you! You felt embarrassed, you felt disappointed, so you had no choice but to return resentfully.

Perhaps you will suffer and blame yourself: who told you to have such beautiful ideals? Who told you to have such a clear mind? Who told you to have such passionate emotions? Who told you to have such beautiful features?... The flash of your sacred beam has revealed the ugliness of so many people's hearts; and often when your brilliance is lost, they come again to make an ugly confession. You came lonely, you went quietly, why did you not leave a clear trace, to shake the ugly group, and to comfort one who loves you silently outside of the wicked? The swallow flew here, only sighing that there was no place to perch, only complaining about being bullied, but you did not notice that there was one outside the ugly group who was willing to exchange enthusiasm with you? He also has a character that makes him painfully uneasy with reality, he also has a heart that cannot be stopped, he also thought about breaking away from this rotten place, and breaking free, but in order to further expose the darkness and challenge it, holding the belief that "if you don't enter the tiger's den, how can you catch the cubs", while the problem of survival is always pressing him, so he straightened his back and endured here.

Of course, he has no reason to assume that you are weaker or more passive than him, because he is brave, he at least has more convenience than you in society. For example, in the moment when he and you met, the rogue hands and greedy faces of those guys would not reach him, on the contrary, he could use them as whetstones for reforming and resisting . What's more, you have a natural beauty, which, although it can create a woman's pride and conceit, often leads to great misfortune in the present circumstances; it seems to create a woman's honor and status, but in fact it is an obstacle to your development. However, if you can ignore your shadow and pity yourself, indulge in vanity, and cherish makeup, rejoicing in showing off your beauty to others, and grieving over the fact that your tenderness has no place to be, then you will have more determination to work for the facts. Perhaps, your family environment is not bad, and you have not had any difficult experiences. This peaceful stream-like, slowly flowing life has cultivated your gentle and virtuous personality. This is your advantage, but it can also be said to be your weakness. For this reason, people will think of you as a good woman who is used to obeying and does not know how to resist, and take your shy and charming attitude as a boring appreciation; for this reason, you are embarrassed by the ridicule from all sides and dare not face the ridiculers in the theater of evil. Precisely because you have not grown up in the rapids, and you have not been tempered by storms, you are too caught up in beautiful fantasies, and you have a pure and fragile heart. This naiveté is invaluable, and it has deeply aroused the sympathy of those who truly love you. He is willing to break your beautiful fantasy with his cry, he is willing to strengthen your timid heart with his strength. Although he cannot see through the villainous heroes, he is constantly searching and moving forward. Regardless of what comes after, or what the results are, but occasionally he is lonely, and the road ahead is vast. So he thought of personal love, and the relationship between personal love and group love; and so he discovered that your shadow had been deeply engraved on his heart, and he had silently fallen in love with you.

I remember, no, the feeling seems to be right in front of me: you lowered your head and sat at the table, hearing the colleague's hateful mockery and ridicule, and daring not, perhaps not even daring to look up at them. Looking at your lovely back, he wanted to run over to talk to you and express some honest opinions several times, but in the end he was obstructed by those thieving and monkey eyes, and he did not get the chance. Once, I heard you say that you were unwilling to be a vase for people to admire here, but that you would like to be a competent, hard-working, poor elementary school teacher. Then you lamented the difficulty of women finding jobs, and the depression that women are given at the moment. He only smiled at you with empathy, and said nothing, thinking that there would definitely be a chance to talk at length in the future, who knew that after that day, he would never see your lovely figure again!

Have you really gone? Have you really left with broken dreams and a drooping head? Did you not know that there were people here who were worth being friends with? Did you not know that the despicable era needs to be repelled in the cursed place? But all this cannot be blamed on you, you were originally a little bird born in a free and peaceful world, and once you are in a dark cage, you lose your courage and wisdom.

Like a swallow in spring, you flew back again on a sudden day. May those light and free wings carry the eternal love of the one who loves you to the vast horizon?

### Grass Under the Window

— Duanmu Menghuan

In the bedroom under the north window, I set down a writing desk, and so; I can write something and see something.

During the day, although sunlight never shines fully on the table, the light is sufficient, and so; my will has been decided! I do not have any excessive demands of it.

If I feel a little tired from writing or reading, then, I put down my pen or book, look at the piece of blue sky in front of the window, and that can very well adjust my weary mind. Later it will be summer, and the slowly moving white clouds will surely be able to further "travel my eyes and wander my thoughts."

If, outside the window there could be such a small piece of lawn or flower bed, at the very least there should be such a few green elm trees, or willows would be good too, that would be even more ideal.

Unfortunately, my stay here will not be long, otherwise I would certainly plant a few branches, watching them gradually grow up, my young mood might be even more cheerful because of that.

With those verdant trees, then, it would inevitably attract some sparrows and the like, and I would not have to worry about not having birdsong to hear!

At night, the sparse shadows of the trees accompany the moonlight, reflected on the window curtain. Sitting quietly under the window, letting me appreciate such scenery, then, even if I am a vulgar person, I cannot help but be elegant at this time.

At this time, I could also pick up a flute and blow my favorite "Spring River Moonlit Night," which would be even more enjoyable. – But, the most suitable time should be late at night.

At the same time, I would also brew a pot of "Dongting Emerald Spring Tea," – milk coffee is not suitable for this time and place – and reluctantly force myself to invite a friend over, to talk about the things we like to talk about.

For such "leisurely sentiments and unrestrained tastes" some people might mock me for "not being fashionable," but, I think, why is it necessary to put on a "bitter face" all day long? Being able to steal a moment of leisure in this floating life, and symbolically let myself take a breath, I dare say that it is not an absolutely "senile" thing.

Lately, I have had quite a bit of "free time." Since I have such a good place for writing and reading, then, I always spend most of my free time "under the window!"

"Under the window," I have discovered a world that I had never discovered before, I have gained new feelings that I had never had before.

This is not what the "notebook" gave me.

I thought of "environment." Under the window, I have come to realize that the environment can indeed change a person's mood. At the same time, I am even more convinced that writing and reading do require a "good environment."

Although what I have is not an absolutely good environment for writing and reading, I am satisfied, because I can sit comfortably, write comfortably, and read comfortably, and there is also a period of quiet time, and a piece of blue sky to see –.

What else do I want?

There is one more thing I want, and that is to let me stay in this environment for a longer time!

### My Fight with T.B. Bacteria

— Luo Chen

T.B. bacteria are like the northern land—

In September, the dust of the yellow sand sky is densely layered,

Spreading throughout the entire space, spreading around me. Everywhere are bacteria,

Everywhere are T.B. bacteria. Bacteria are like yellow sand in a great wind—

Penetrating the mask,

Sweeping past the hairs in the nostrils, they—

Drill—drill—drill—towards the depths of the lungs,

Towards the liver, towards the gallbladder, towards the kidneys, towards the large intestine… towards every vulnerable part of the human body—

—Attack! I live together with T.B. bacteria!

My office

Faces the chimney of the boiler room, coal smoke—carbon dioxide—carbon monoxide

Suffocating me and

Crowding out fresh air! My workshop

Hides in the damp corner of the basement,

Dampness—darkness—and sultriness, the most excellent,

Unparalleled culture medium for T.B. bacteria. My workers,

Complexions pale, skinny like firewood. Interns,

Always with their bodies bent over—

—Coughing! Returning home,

In the middle of the night,

I can hear my elderly mother's painful, low cough.

Her lungs have been eroded by T.B. bacteria since she was young. My younger brother

Suffers from pulmonary T.B. My younger sister

Suffers from intestinal T.B. My good friend

Is coughing up blood because of T.B.,

Unable to participate in—

—The imminent graduation exam! My neighbor's lovely little girl

Died last month from T.B. meningitis! Ah! T.B. bacteria,

—Everywhere, heavily

Tightly

Surrounding me, like an invading army

Besieging the city of justice with deadly artillery fire. Ah, no! I must be strong—strong

—Even stronger

To fight the T.B. bacteria!

—Like the national heroes

Defending their own homeland!

### Against the Current, and Preface

— Song Xiang

For several years, I have consistently refrained from writing articles that I deem unworthy of my pen. If I ever did, I would have destroyed them in those past years. At that time, I felt that, apart from Napoleon in modern history, there would be no more unfortunate events where a person's inability to conquer their environment would cause the phrase "Man will conquer nature" to suffer unexpected insults or bankruptcy. However, in reality, the formation of failure often completely overturns and obliterates the so-called "Man will conquer nature" crown. Therefore, from the height of Mount Tai to the lightness of a goose feather, I believe that there is simply nothing in the world that can be transformed or overcome by relying solely on an individual's will in the face of the environment. Since ancient times, in dictionaries, in the majestic history, all fiery and encouraging words, as well as moving and inspiring speeches, once that moment has passed, are equivalent to wine that has lost its fizz. I think this is not my grumbling, nor is it my sense of disappointment. The inscrutability of life is inherently subject to the whims and control of fate. If you have strength, you can temporarily overcome it, or be eternally conquered by it. But having read through the history of China and foreign countries, ancient and modern, where has there been such a person? Writing to this point, I really can't write any further. I can only shake my head and sigh, saying: "Alas! This is why life is life."

On May 8, 1945, the European war finally ended with Germany's surrender. The great leader Hitler, after a period of brilliant history dedicated to saving his country from its plight and striving for its revival, followed the same unfortunate path of fighting on two fronts and reduced thirty years of effort to being ruined in a single day and escaping. Not only did he fail to tear up the Treaty of Versailles to create a revived and powerful Germany, but even the twenty-seven years of misery were destined to be deepened by today's fate. Although we don't necessarily judge heroes by success or failure, this kind of reality, without even comparing it to Napoleon in history, is enough to chill us—all efforts are in vain. Why bother talking about struggle in the world? It's better to muddle through and entrust everything to nature! While lamenting such things in the world, I began my own negativity and wrote articles that I wouldn't normally write. This is today's "Against the Current" (The above is the preface).

(One)

People who used to openly and secretly slander others have now become 100% realistic worshipers of power and influence. I admire their ability to seize reality and adapt to the environment, just as my own inability to ingratiate myself has become the opposite extreme. In the past, in any position, I never uttered a single word of slander, nor did I harbor such thoughts in my heart. Even now, I still don't regard those who are worshiped by the power-hungry as outstanding figures of an era. But because of this, I have obliterated reality, to the point that others are full, while I am hungry and cold. Finally, there are these two completely different distinctions. I have received a lesson from reality and deeply understood the true meaning of life. There is no need to regret the past, nor is there a need to yearn for the future. As long as you grasp and utilize reality, you won't have to worry about overestimating the value of life, and there will be a meaning to being human!

(Two)

The "Historical Records" records Su Qin's self-description of returning home in glory: "If I had two hundred acres of good land, and my father, brothers, wife, and sisters-in-law were all on good terms, how could I wear the seals of office of six states!" If this kind of talk wasn't a feeling that Su Qin expressed after wearing the seals of office of six states, I can assert that Sima Qian wouldn't have bothered to write it so faithfully to vent his anger. However, the father, brothers, wife, and sisters-in-law of Su Qin, who took advantage of reality, not only knelt to welcome him thirty miles outside the city but also unanimously stated afterward that the reason why they had previously looked down on this Prime Minister of Six States was simply that they hoped he would have "such a day"! Do you say that this is unreasonable? Wouldn't that obliterate the motives of the so-called "benevolent people" of the past and present? But no matter how they say it, Su Qin knows it in his heart. As long as he doesn't "misunderstand," how can I not envy him for having Su Qin's father, brothers, wife, and sisters-in-law!

(Three)

My neighbor is a couple who are not only uneducated but also childish in their minds. The man actually earns two or three hundred thousand a month, but according to the woman, "Our expenses are not small, at least seven hundred thousand yuan." They have six children, so it doesn't seem like she's bragging. The man "respects women's rights" to the utmost, so he regards his wife's orders as sacred edicts. And this woman! She is simply a "Zhao Zilong with boundless courage" heroine. All day long, she's either playing mahjong, losing eighteen thousand at a time, or gossiping about the neighbors, showing her "heaven-sent" eloquence. She is good at scolding and arguing, and even after provoking others, she calls the neighborhood committee to mediate and determine who is right and who is wrong, the neighborhood committee member immediately says: "My father is an official in Nanjing, you can't help others speak, you must be sensible," and so on. Therefore! She often proclaims herself the "victor who is glorious first"! However, although we are close neighbors, my wife feels all sorts of mental pressure because of her, because she is extremely "considerate" of my wife, and when she meets her, she asks about our embarrassing situation, and so on, using it as conversation material in "peaceful times," and then she works "diligently" day and night to incite my wife to divorce me, so my wife tells me: "If you continue to be so poor, she will call the police to find me to divorce you."

### Volleyball League Women's Group, Three Provinces Completes Hegemony with All Wins

— Jie

The strength and situation of the two women's groups in the volleyball league have already been described before. So far, the women's group of Three Provinces has completed their hegemony. Four wins in four matches to win this year's championship, fulfilling the dreams of those heroines, it is also a good thing. In Group A, the Northern team has five wins in five matches. There is still one match against the home team, and the top spot can be unshakable, so it is possible to maintain the honor of always winning. In Group B, Division Two, there are many participants, and also unfortunately, several times the weather was delayed due to rain, so there is still little evidence at the moment. It is estimated that the most powerful in Group B, Division One is the Yong'an Haiyou. Huayan is the most promising in Division Two. There are still many battles to come, so wait until there is a little clue before making another narrative.

### Three Provinces Record

First Round Won against Xinben 2-0 Huayan 2-0

Second Round Won against Xinben 2-0 Huayan 2-0

Looking at the above records, the four wins and four victories of the Three Provinces all won straight sets, two sets to zero. From this, it can be seen that the strength difference is too great. It is easy for the Three Provinces to win the championship. However, strictly speaking, it also makes the team lack interest. The team competition is all hoping to win, but at the same time, it must defeat those of equal strength to be called happy, and to be able to get ball skills progress. If they meet people who are too different in strength, winning is of course gratifying, but there is no doubt that they are not excited enough. Therefore, the author can't help but have some feelings when watching the four games in Three Provinces. It is investigated that the last champion, the Green team, is not without the possibility of forming an army, and the bronze medalist of the last session, the Zhibing team, also has the possibility of gathering, so it is hoped that the two teams will be organized in time to form three with the Three Provinces team, forming a triangular confrontation, it is not what enthusiastic fans of women's volleyball are happy to hear. Then, they can sell tickets at their discretion to fill good deeds. In addition to adding excitement to the too-cold women's league in Muben, it is also beneficial to improve the level of women's water. I hope that the authorities and the above-mentioned three provinces can adopt this point of view or not?

For the majestic appearance of the Three Provinces in this session, there is not enough introduction material, because there is no development under the situation of smashing eggs with stones. Therefore, in general, the whole team has average talent, and both offense and defense are complete. The technical skills of the nine heroines are enough for analysis

Li Bo, a veteran of more than ten years in the sand, is old, and the model is indeed still there. Her backhand pull is still beautiful and unique. Only when she wants to jump over the net, she already sees that she can't do what she wants. In fact, Ms. Li already has a group of children, and it is commendable to have this spirit and be active in the stadium, and she is afraid of seeing it in female athletes.

Chen Meizhen, as the captain of the team, does have real skills. She is tall and skilled. She has a good hand, and she must hit the target when she fires at the edge of the net. She is truly miraculous. In this session, she is more at will for those who have no block gang.

Lu Cuifang, Ms. Lu does not seem to be noticed by the general public, because she never eats merit, and has less chance to share it. In fact, her contribution to helping others win is invaluable. The most important thing for players to pay attention to is cooperation. Therefore, I think she is a successful player.

Chen Liuzhen is Mei Zhen's sister. The pair of Chen sisters has long enjoyed a high reputation in the volleyball world, and has not declined slightly. Liuzhen is in the second row on the right, and can hit and knock well, with enough strength to do it well. However, this year I saw a performance, because I had nowhere to develop.

Shen Meiying. This session was stopped due to Shi Ruijuan's marriage, so Miss Shen is in charge of the second row in the middle. Shen and Meizhen have been old classmates, and they have already achieved good results representing the school team, so they are old partners. In addition to her good at saving the ball, the ball she takes can be used for Mei Zhen to hit, and the tacit understanding between each other is known. Therefore, Shen should be paired with Mei Zhen to be able to see her advantages.

Chen Ze Zhuang is a physical education teacher at China Jinan School, with standard physique, and is in this life here from morning to night, so he has a light and familiar results. However, Ms. Chen has not seen any special results in this session. The author always sees her when she is fighting, and she always has other thoughts, but she also has the qualifications of a veteran, and is willing to take a step back. If she can work hard and go all out, her achievements must be more than this.

Dong Jian is also an old predecessor of the athlete. He has done a lot of research on the 　zizi army, and this time he was invited by Three Provinces to participate in the promised land formation. However, because of his increasingly blessed body and his secluded location in the corner of the third row, there is really no chance to do anything. Looking at his skills, it is obvious that he is old in this way compared to a strong player.

Chen Jie Shu, the mastermind of saving dangerous balls in Three Provinces team. Ms. Chen is short in stature, easy to run and grab, and has sufficient experience. She can often win by surprise and save dangerous balls, and her ball skills are excellent. In addition, Chen's serve is undoubtedly the most powerful in the Three Provinces team, hitting the ball in two steps, being quick and accurate, and is a good talent.

Le Zhusi, because she is in the corner of the third row and the opponent is weak, there are few opportunities. Therefore, Miss Le can be seen as if she had never played before, even under the scorching sun for every game. What about her skills? I dare not make reckless comments. Only Miss Le's always smiling face on the field, gains and losses seem to be irrelevant, her sportsmanship is always clear in this.

The Group A champion, the Zhongbei team, will be introduced after their battle ends. Each part of Group B will definitely have an audit by next week. This article is a congratulatory article after Three Provinces won the women's group championship.

Review

### United Overseas Chinese Defeats White Horse

The first act of the charity football match organized by the Football Association to raise education funds was a friendly match between the United team and the Portuguese merchants. The second battle was held last weekend, with the rematch between the Zi Ma Qiaolian, who had faced off in the eighth welfare match. Because of the widespread fame of the two teams, their appeal was naturally good. Moreover, with the sudden increase in paddle prices, 2,000 yuan for the grandstand and 5,000 yuan for the inside, it also created a new ticket price. Therefore, in terms of income, it is naturally considerable, which is of great benefit to the education fund.

The result of this game was one to one. According to the battle situation that day, many people criticized that it was lucky for Bai Ma to be able to force each other to one, and maintain it to the end. But I deeply feel that the forwards of the Overseas Chinese Federation have always lacked intellectual performance. They cannot use the method of inducing the enemy to leave their position, and they do not have the accurate shooting skills, so the only way to deal with them is for the guards to use the (Cover goalarea) method. They can only fire aimlessly in the distant area. What's more, Zhang Banglun of Bai Ma has already insight into the trajectory of such a cold arrow. And Zhang's skills are really well-coordinated, so the Overseas Chinese Federation accidentally stole a cold meal in the upper field for three minutes - the Zima position was unstable - after that, although the offensive was so much throughout the game, the forwards unfortunately did not gain anything due to the above reasons. Therefore - my conclusion is, rather than Bai Ma lucky, it is better to say that Bai Ma's guards saw the opponent's path clearly, and managed to maintain no loss in the defensive posture.

Furthermore, how can Bai Ma not win the ball? Of course, the forward line is missing the three generals Dai Lingjing, Sun Jinshun, and Li Yao. Before the game, I heard the news that Sun and Li would not be playing, so I wrote it in the previous issue of this journal. Although Li Yichen and Wu Qixiang filled the gap, they would never be as wonderful as the Donghua Five Tigers. What's more, Li Shuchen didn't come, and Dai Lingjing was temporarily absent due to abdominal pain. So Qu Yongfu and Luo Zifu came to fill in. This became a line of rabble, and in the second half, because Qu Yongfu was injured and replaced by Han Chonggen, it appeared even more fragmented. How can you ask for an offensive? In the last twenty minutes, Wu Qixiang saw that it was difficult to perform, and the rear was in a troubled situation, so he retreated to help defend, so Mai Youliang and Han Longhai, who were wandering on the front line, really had the distress of heroes having nowhere to display their martial arts. However, in the extremely rare chance, Bu Yu Youliang or Long Hai got the ball, the two of them could even push forward and penetrate the hinterland. Although they failed to achieve success, the threat to the soldiers was still very serious. From this point as a ten-fold deduction, assuming that the Donghua Five Tigers came to play, dealing with the stupid defense method of the Overseas Chinese Federation, it would be as easy as turning one's hand to defeat Huanglong. From the previous session to this session, the conclusion after the end of this football season, I always dare to say that the five former Donghua forwards are the most suitable to break through the defense of the Overseas Chinese Federation, and they will be ruthless against the Portuguese Merchants team. The entire reason is that they understand the path of others, and they know the cause and effect of how to stop it.

Finally, there is one point of feeling, which seems to be expressed quickly, so I wrote it below.

This is the behavior of the players and the so-called spectators, which cannot give me the most 　impression. Like 　's injury, of course, he slammed into the terrace card and fell down at the same time, everyone was still working hard, and the terrace card was using arm strength to 　injure, which is all that there is no sportsmanship between each other. There was also the entanglement between Bao and Fu Bo, a room 塲, it seems that there is a grudge between these two people, so the general audience is more unnecessarily stimulating 　　, which almost led to a quarrel. I hope that this kind of phenomenon will be absolutely reduced and eliminated in the future. We hope that players should strive for progress in their skills and win victories, but also promote the best sportsmanship, so that the atmosphere of the football world will not retreat but advance, which is what we pray for. This requires a large number of spectators to help and the media to supervise. If we don't know this, can we win the sympathy of all parties? (Amateur Reporter)

### Basketball Group B League Concludes, Youlu Wins the Overall Championship

— Skinny Man

The Basketball League Group B has been held since March 21st, with a total of seven parts, and after two months of competition, the champions of each part were produced in order, and then a lottery was held for elimination. Among them, in the first round of the finals, Zhenyuan fought against Feima, and Feima won. However, Zhenyuan was dissatisfied with the referee and protested, and the authorities considered it carefully. Later, it was decided that Zhenyuan's protest was not credible, so it could be carried out smoothly. The final scene was held at 6 pm on the other day (14th) in the Sichuan Road Youth Association Gym, where Youlu and Longhua competed, and as a result, Youlu first lost and then won, and won the Group B overall championship.

Basketball Group B Table

Final Battle between Youlu and Longhua

In the final, Youlu and Longhua were both the leaders in Group B, and their water level was not below the ordinary Group A team, and both hired famous basketball generals as guidance. This game is related to Lingyu. Unexpectedly, at the start of the game, the coaches of both teams were not seen to be present, which is really inexplicable. It was not until the end of the first half, when Longhua took the lead, that Youlu coach Kaiqimiluofu arrived and secretly gave instructions, and he saw a change of wind, breaking through the other party's weakness, and then he was able to turn defeat into victory. Finally, he won the Group B overall championship with a score of thirty to twenty-six. From this, it can be seen that the effectiveness of the guidance, its importance is known, if Longhua guidance can also be on the scene, then the judgment of victory or defeat, or there may be unexpected results.

According to the tactics of the two teams, in the first half, both used a five-man zone defense, and Longhua won because he was better at sacrificing. Nai Youlu's guidance taught him a method, that is, to use a man-to-man system when defending. Gai Youlu team members are more powerful, and they should achieve twice the result with half the effort, and the attack is to use the middle road. In addition, the tall body is used for follow-up under the basket, so under the waste, there can still be follow-up opportunities. Longhua Guo was taken advantage of and still 　original　　stable play doctrine. Assuming that Longhua sees the opponent adopting a man-to-man policy, it also changes its strategy, especially when attacking, it can use high speed, then Youlu may not be able to get what it wants.

In addition, the game judges were originally scheduled to be Jin Botao and Zhou 　Bang. Jin had asked Changju for leave the next day, and Zhou 　Bang temporarily did not come. It is said that or Zhou's fear, is based on the frequent right and wrong of the basketball game recently. However, according to the author's observation, he used his law enforcement to see great skills, and his experience is also very sufficient, so he must be blocked by other things. It was temporarily served by Liu Hesheng and Huang Cunrui on the day of the salvation. Liu Hesheng made a speech to the players before the competition, and added encouragement, and the result was quite effective. The two teams only competed up and down in their ball skills, and distinguished the pros and cons in tactics, and there was no rudeness and quarrels, which is a harvest that is worth mentioning.

The New Army Youlu Has Unlimited Prospects

Youlu is a rising new army, organized by some students of St. John's University, and has a physical education teacher Qu Ren, a famous player, Kaiji Miluofu as guidance. The team members, with the relationship of classmates, gave the opportunity for considerable practice, and they were able to make rapid progress. And as a student army, the physique is strong. Because of this, the team has become famous, and it has been able to overcome strong enemies and win the Group B overall championship. Its basic team members are roughly the following six generals:

Wang Yuguang - medium stature, serving as a forward, shooting baskets is extremely accurate, is the soul of the team's scoring.

Lin Hongci - the center of the team, because the height is over the people, so interception under the basket, is better than others. It is even more sure to follow up and score. Lin Jun has been training in this way for a long time. It is rare to be calm on the land.

Diao Guohua - rushing into battle, brave and unstoppable. It is a pity that the skill of shooting baskets has not yet reached perfection. Otherwise, it would be a good forward general.

Shen Zongyun - has a sports Tencun, is a basketball and volleyball two-story figure. In the basketball team, he is an all-rounder who can attack and defend. The long-term strength seems to be slightly insufficient.

Shi Cunchong - this son runs to spare, and he is very tight to see people. It is extremely suitable for the position of defender. Since he is in his youth, he can be expected to be even better, and he is encouraged!

Zhuang Yikai - clear mind, not flustered when meeting a strong enemy, is his advantage, quite able to shoot from a distance, but there are still a few pieces of food. If you practice more, you can get it.

### All Shanghai Baseball Invitational Tournament: Panda Team Wins the Championship After Hard Fought Battles

— Shan Miao

The baseball movement in Shanghai has been dormant for a long time. Although there has been a softball league in the summer for the past three years, our Chinese have never won a championship. This year, in mid-May, a baseball invitational league was organized by the Japanese expatriate and YMCA authorities. Our Chinese Panda Team was also among those invited. In addition, there were strong teams such as the Japanese expatriate team, the YMCA team, and the Portuguese Merchant team, making a total of four teams participating in the competition. Our Chinese team lived up to expectations, fought bravely and defeated the Japanese expatriates, winning the championship. This is truly the first time in Shanghai's history that our Chinese have won the All-Shanghai Baseball Championship. The details of the league are recorded in detail below.

League Teams Have Average Skill

Among the teams in this league, before the competition, it was generally expected that the Japanese expatriate team would be the strongest, followed by the YMCA, then the Portuguese merchants, and the Chinese Panda team would be the weakest. This was because there were many famous players in the Japanese expatriate team, such as catcher Miura, who was a baseball player at Meiji University in Japan, and the team members were all Japanese expatriates who had studied in the United States, especially pitcher Ueshima, first baseman Iwatate, and third baseman Wakamu were the best. The YMCA and Portuguese Merchant teams each had players who were famous generals in the baseball world with rich experience. Therefore, the Panda team was considered by many to have no hope. However, after the start of the competition, there was no significant difference in the skills of these four teams. Because the league adopted a double round-robin system, each team played against the other teams twice, and each won once, which shows that the skills of the teams were very average. Every game was full of excitement, especially the three hard-fought battles between the Panda team and the Japanese expatriates.

Liang Junyou's Great Contribution

In the first game between the Panda team and the Japanese expatriates, the Panda team was miserably defeated by a score of three to one. In this game, the Panda team did not even have one hit, which was entirely due to the pitching of Mr. Wakamu, the pitcher of the Japanese expatriate team. In the second game, the Panda team, in order to avenge their previous defeat, had coach Liang Fuchu personally play as first baseman. The game was extremely tense. Liang Yousheng, the pitcher of the Panda team, used his superb skills. With a flick of his hand, the ball dropped, and its sharpness caused the Japanese expatriate players to swing at thin air. Third baseman and batter Wen Tianhua and Wen Ruixiong both had excellent performances, so they won a major victory with a score of five to three.

The Japanese Expatriate Generals Became Flustered on the Spot

In the final of the league, the Japanese expatriates and the Panda team competed for the championship. On that day, there were more foreign spectators than Chinese. The odds of betting on the victory of the game were three to one, that is, most people thought that the Japanese expatriates would win. As everyone knows, in this game, Ueshima served as the pitcher for the Japanese expatriates. This gentleman was flustered in the second and fourth innings and made many mistakes. For example, in the second inning, Wen Duanxiong of the Chinese team hit a wonderful ball to first base. When running to second base, Ueshima hurriedly threw the ball to second baseman Somekawa, but who knew that the force of the throw was too great, and the ball flew straight out of the field, and left fielder Ueno missed the catch again, so Wen Ruixiong ran back to home base and scored a point. Again, in the fourth inning, Li Qiteng of the Chinese team used a bunt. Ueshima moved forward to catch the ball and hurriedly threw it to first base. Due to being flustered, the force was too great, causing first baseman Iwatate to fail to catch it, and Li Qisheng had stolen to third base. In this game, pitcher Liang Yousheng once again used his superb skills, greatly displaying his sharp and curved ball, causing the Japanese expatriate team to only have Ueshima get a "triple" in the sixth inning. As a result of the game, the Panda team won the championship with a major victory of seven to three.

Panda Team's Hard-Fought Spirit Surpasses Others

In this championship game, in addition to the lack of composure of the Japanese expatriate team members, the spirit of the Chinese team was commendable. The Chinese team had the ambition to win and had to defeat the Japanese team. Therefore, before the game, coach Liang Fuchu repeatedly told them to fight with an indomitable spirit, so that there was hope of winning. Therefore, the Panda team members calmly dealt with the game. In the third and fourth innings, they killed four Japanese expatriate players who were stealing bases. Their agility and speed were excellent, and there were many wonderful scenes, which were highly praised by the audience, making it impossible for the Japanese expatriates to steal bases and only able to sigh helplessly. Pitcher Liang Yousheng threw out six people in a row (Strike out), and still endured the pain and threw fiercely because of leg cramps. On the other hand, the Japanese expatriate team members lost their fighting spirit in the sixth and seventh innings due to excessive score loss. Therefore, after the game, Miura, the catcher of the Japanese expatriate team, sighed and said: "The victory of the Panda team in this battle is actually due to their spirit surpassing us."

### Essentials of Basketball Theory (21)

— Liang Zhaoan

Although modern basketball offense is as described above, it is very important to know how to use it to generate effectiveness. Most teams with a higher level of play use the above tactics in this way. After each time gaining possession of the ball bounced back from the opponent's backboard, they must first use a fast break, taking advantage of the opponent's lack of preparation or slow retreat, using a straight-line pass, a long pass to the teammate under the basket for a "steal". Or using a single person, rushing forward, dribbling the ball straight into the heart of the enemy, and shooting forward. The purpose of the ambush attack is to attack the enemy's unpreparedness, or to gang up on the opponent with two-on-one or three-on-two, especially two-on-one, which is the most effective. When the opponent has three people retreating to the backcourt to defend, the possibility of a fast break gradually disappears. Therefore, when starting the offense after gaining possession of the ball, if you see that the opponent is retreating quickly and defending tightly, you cannot use a fast break, but you must use a slow offensive positional war. On one hand, the two guards pass the ball to each other, passing it over the mid-line. On the other hand, the center and two forwards move towards the field, deploy the battle line, adapt to the situation, and use various slow offensive methods or delay tactics. The main purpose of using a slow offensive positional war is to break the five-man zone defense, lure the enemy away from their positions, and take advantage of the weakness to attack. When the game is about to end and our side has scored more points, we can also use the perimeter passing method to maintain possession of the ball, without attacking again to achieve the final victory. However, if the opponent is smart, they will definitely switch to the "man-to-man" defense method, forcing our side to attack, so as to seize our side's lost ball and launch a counterattack. At this time, our side has to change its tactics and use blocking offense to restrain them. The most important thing in using the blocking method is to find a way to block one of the main enemies, so that they cannot get out in time to seize our side's ball, so that our side's ball holder can avoid the enemy's tight marking, follow the predetermined offensive route, and safely rush straight to the basket and shoot in. When blocking people, you must avoid touching the opponent's body and committing a foul, and you must also prevent the opponent from knowing it in advance, otherwise the opponent will use the switch defense method to prepare in advance, and our side will lose all its efforts. However, if the opponent sees our side switching to this method, they will definitely adopt the five-man zone defense method again, then our side has no choice but to use a slow offense to break it, which is the most common way to use the Sichuan offense.

Offensive and defensive skills and theories have been described above, but how to make them a reality, not just in theory, is related to other important issues, which instructors and players must carefully study, one is the instructor's own problem, and the other is the player's mental cultivation problem. These are described below.

Instructor's own problems: The instructor is like the chief of staff and commander-in-chief of the two armies fighting on the battlefield. They should have a thorough understanding of various offensive and defensive formations and the knowledge related to the application of tactics. If they only have a superficial understanding, it will be difficult to cope with the situation in battle. Therefore, an instructor must know the skills, abilities, physical and psychological states of their team's players, and must also be aware of all the circumstances of the game, such as the timing, location, and the opponent's strength and tactics. The so-called knowing yourself and knowing your enemy, you can win every battle.

When adopting offensive and defensive tactics, the team's players' abilities, age, physique, physical strength, and personality should be the main considerations, so that the tactics can suit the players' own conditions. You cannot force the tactics to fit the players. If the offensive and defensive tactics are good, but the players' abilities are insufficient, or the tactics require a lot of energy, but the players' physical strength is not enough, or the tactics require extremely agile movements, but the players are older and slower in personality, then they are ignorant of the excellence of the tactics. If they are adopted rashly, they will inevitably fail. Therefore, no matter what kind of excellent offensive and defensive tactics are adopted, they must be tailored to the players' own situation, which is the condition for winning.

Before the game, you should understand the strength and weakness of the opponent's ability, the speed of their movements, and the offensive and defensive tactics they use, so as to stipulate the methods that our team should use to deal with them. For example, if the opposing team is strong, our side must defend more than attack. If the opposing team is weaker than our side, our side should attack more than defend. If the opposing team moves slowly, we should use a fast break. On the contrary, if they move quickly, we should use a slow offensive positional war. In other cases, during the competition, we must also pay attention to all changes at all times, such as the tension and relaxation of the situation, the impact of the size of the audience and the venue, the location and the timing, and the difference between the time and the score. For example, if there is still a long time, the scores are equal; or if the time is about to end, the scores are far apart; or if the time is about to end, the scores are equal. All of these factors are very important. We should understand the situation and its evolution, adapt to the situation, and change tactics. We must not stick to the old ways.

Player's Mental Cultivation Problems

In addition to the player's skill and technical training, they must achieve excellent results, and must also pay attention to their mental cultivation. The most important aspects of mental cultivation are cooperation and the spirit of struggle, which are briefly described below.

The spirit of cooperation is a very important training in modern basketball. The success of all offensive and defensive tactics depends entirely on the ability to cooperate, because basketball is a collective effort, not a game that can be played individually. However, although cooperation is not a performance of personal skills, it is impossible to cooperate if the individual's basic movements are not proficient. The failure of offensive and defensive tactics is not initially due to the poor formation, but mostly due to a lack of knowledge and the rawness of individual basic movements. Because the players have no grasp of the basic movements, the entire team's movements cannot be connected. For example, if the receiver wants to catch the ball, the passer cannot pass it. If the passer wants to pass the ball, there is no one to receive it, or there is an opportunity to shoot but it is inaccurate, or the thinking is not quick, and the movements are not agile, resulting in the opponent breaking through. Strict defense, even if there is an opportunity to attack, it cannot achieve the goal. All of these are closely related to cooperation. Therefore, the first priority of modern basketball teams is to instill and cultivate a spirit of cooperation. This is not only true for new teams, but also for well-trained teams. Especially the so-called teams that are satisfied with their collective skills, their decline is invariably due to only focusing on personal technical performance and the loosening of cooperation. The spirit of cooperation is not only refers to technical movements. Other factors such as an indomitable, calm, unproud, and non-depressed mentality and emotions, and even all actions, words, spirit, attitude, etc., are closely related to cooperation.

The spirit of struggle is also what is emphasized in today's basketball training. Because basketball is a competitive sport, players must have both wisdom and courage, and must also have a spirit of struggle. In a game between two teams, although the technical aspects are very important, most of it depends on the players' perseverance in the struggle, which is the key to determining victory or defeat. Therefore, players should have an indomitable and unrelenting spirit of struggle. From the moment the whistle blows until the end of the game, their spirit should be vigorous, and they should bravely move forward, without being subdued by the opponent's pressure or the reversal of the situation. Even if they unfortunately fail due to technical reasons, their spirit must remain consistent from beginning to end. Even a moment of slackness is not allowed. Such a team, even if it loses, is still glorious. You must never develop the bad habit of only being able to win and not being able to lose. It is common to see some teams that are on the verge of victory, but when the opponent intensifies the pursuit and the scores are close, the players become panicked. Success fails, and they are defeated by others. This is indeed the key to success or failure, and it is a common problem that everyone is prone to. This is nothing more than a lack of perseverance in the struggle, and the result will inevitably be defeat. They should do their best, and should not be intimidated and discouraged by the opponent's temporary success.
