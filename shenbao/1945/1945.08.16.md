### Extraordinary Measures to Resolve the Current Situation: Japanese Emperor Issues Peace Rescript, Orders Government to Accept Joint Declaration of China, the United States, and the Soviet Union

Tokyo, 15th (Central News Agency Telegram) – The Japanese Emperor broadcast at noon on the 15th. In order to ensure that the entire population could listen, even areas without electricity were provided with temporary power. This broadcast was not only for Japan but was also simultaneously broadcast throughout Greater East Asia. It is also understood that following the Emperor's broadcast, Prime Minister Suzuki and the Japanese government made extremely important announcements regarding the current state of the Greater East Asia War. At the same time, all Japanese newspapers delayed publication to immediately publish this news after the Emperor's broadcast, communicating it to everyone.

Tokyo, 15th (Central News Agency Telegram) – For the sake of peace, the Emperor commanded the government on the 14th to notify the four countries of China, the United States, the United Kingdom, and the Soviet Union of their acceptance of the Potsdam Declaration. Simultaneously, he issued a grand rescript, declaring the necessity of accepting the four countries' joint declaration, and personally broadcast the rescript at noon on the 15th.

### Rescript

I, in view of the world situation and the current state of the Empire, desire to resolve the situation through extraordinary measures. I hereby inform you, my loyal subjects:

I have ordered the Imperial Government to notify the four countries of China, the United States, the United Kingdom, and the Soviet Union of its acceptance of their joint declaration.

To ensure the well-being of the Imperial subjects and to share the joy of common prosperity with all nations – this is the ancestral legacy of our Imperial ancestors and my constant concern. Formerly, we declared war on the United States and the United Kingdom, also with the expectation of ensuring the Empire's survival and the stability of East Asia. Rejecting the sovereignty of other nations and seizing territory was never my intention. However, the war has lasted for four years, and my army and navy have fought bravely, my officials have been diligent, and my one hundred million subjects have served the public to the best of their abilities. However, the war situation has not necessarily improved, and the general trend of the world is also unfavorable to us. Moreover, the enemy has used cruel bombs, frequently killing and wounding innocent people, causing immeasurable suffering. If the war continues, not only will our nation ultimately be destroyed, but human civilization will also be ruined. How then can I protect my countless subjects and answer to the spirits of the Imperial ancestors? Therefore, I have ordered the Imperial Government to accept the joint declaration.

I must express my regret to the allied nations that have consistently assisted Japan in liberating East Asia. My heart is torn for the Imperial subjects who have died in battle, died in the line of duty, or died untimely deaths, and for their families. I am deeply concerned for the welfare of those who have been wounded in battle, suffered disaster, or lost their homes.

However, the hardships the Empire will face in the future will undoubtedly be extraordinary. I also deeply understand the feelings of you, my subjects. However, I, in accordance with the dictates of fate, endure the unendurable to seek peace for all generations.

Here, I can maintain the national polity and trust in the loyalty of you, my subjects. I will stand with you, my subjects. As for those who are swayed by emotions, cause disturbances, or ostracize compatriots, confuse the situation, and betray trust in the world, these are what I most deeply caution against. I hope that the entire nation, united as one family, will pass on to future generations the firm belief that the Land of the Gods will not perish. Remembering that the task is heavy and the road is long, gather all strength for future construction, firmly believe in morality, steadfastly uphold principles, and vow to promote the spirit of the national polity without lagging behind the progress of the world. I hope that you, my subjects, will all understand my intentions.

### Potsdam Declaration: Japan Accepted

Tokyo, 15th (Central News Agency Telegram) – According to diplomatic sources here, before accepting the four countries' joint declaration, the Japanese government had engaged in diplomatic negotiations. That is, after the war situation became unfavorable to Japan and the general trend of the world became even more unfavorable, Japan had already made the greatest efforts to maintain the national polity. On November 27th of the 32nd year of the Republic (1943), China, the United States, and the United Kingdom held a meeting in Cairo and issued the Cairo Declaration, causing turmoil within Japan. However, the Japanese diplomatic authorities, calmly observing the war situation, had already considered peace. By May of this year, Germany had collapsed, and this view became even stronger. The Japanese government then used the Soviet Union, which maintained a neutral relationship, as an intermediary to strive for peace with the United Kingdom and the United States. However, on July 26th of this year, the three countries issued the Potsdam Joint Declaration, stating that this was a final ultimatum to Japan. The Japanese government then adopted an attitude of ignoring it. Who knew that the diplomatic significance of Japan's ignoring it would become the reason for the Soviet Union to declare war? The Soviet Union's declaration of war revealed the fact that Japan was trying to enlist the Soviet Union's help to seek peace. Because of the Soviet Union's declaration of war, Japan's diplomatic efforts all came to naught. What's more, the appearance of the atomic bomb had already made it impossible to continue the war. On August 9th, the Japanese government issued a notice accepting the Potsdam Declaration. This notice was based on the understanding that the authority of the Supreme Ruler would not be harmed. The four countries sent a reply to Tokyo on the 13th. From this, the Japanese government knew that the institution of the Emperor had been secured and thus surrendered to the four countries of China, the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union.

Central News Agency Report – According to Domei News Agency, Tokyo, 15th, the Japanese government held several Supreme War Guidance Conferences and extraordinary cabinet meetings from the 9th to the 14th regarding the acceptance of the Potsdam Declaration. On the 9th, a Supreme War Guidance Conference was held in the Imperial Palace from 2:30 PM to 5:30 PM. An extraordinary cabinet meeting was held at the Prime Minister's residence from 6:30 PM to 10:10 PM to hear the opinions of the Prime Minister and others. From 11:55 PM to 3:00 AM the next morning, an Imperial Conference was held in the Imperial Palace to decide to accept the Potsdam Declaration. Continuing from 3:10 AM to 4:00 AM, an extraordinary cabinet meeting was held at the Prime Minister's residence to review the method of announcement. At 7:00 AM on the 11th, the Swiss government was asked to notify of the intention to accept. On the 12th, from 2:05 PM to 2:44 PM, Prime Minister Suzuki went to the Imperial Palace to report. From 3:00 PM to 5:30 PM, a cabinet meeting was held to exchange opinions. At the same time, the Imperial Family Council was held in the Imperial Palace from 3:00 PM to 5:00 PM. At 8:00 AM on the 13th, the official reply from the United Nations was received. From 8:50 AM to 9:10 AM, the Supreme War Guidance Conference was held, attended by the Prime Minister, the Ministers of the Army, Navy, and Foreign Affairs, the Chief of the General Staff, and the Chief of the Naval General Staff, totaling six people. It was reconvened from 10:30 AM to 3:00 PM to discuss the issue of maintaining the national polity. From 4:00 PM to 7:30 PM, a cabinet meeting was held, but opinions could not be unified. On the 14th, Prime Minister Suzuki went to the Imperial Palace twice. An Imperial Conference was held. At 10:00 AM, a Marshal's Conference was held in the Imperial Palace. From 10:45 AM to noon, an unprecedented Imperial Conference was held in the Imperial Palace. After leaving the palace, three cabinet meetings were held in succession. By 8:30 PM, the Prime Minister went to the Imperial Palace again, completing all procedures and deciding to issue the rescript.

### Highest Commanders of the Japanese Army and Navy in Shanghai Issue Announcement: Those Who Hinder Public Order Will Be Dealt With According to Military Law

Central News Agency, Shanghai Report – The highest commanders of the Japanese Army and Navy on the ground issued the following announcement on the 15th:

In light of this new situation, the Japanese military believes that ensuring public order is the most critical measure for maintaining and enhancing the well-being of the Chinese people. Therefore, the Japanese military on the ground, in accordance with the orders of superiors, will temporarily continue to carry out the task of ensuring public order. We sincerely hope that the Chinese people will trust the Japanese military, not be misled by rumors, maintain a calm attitude throughout, and cooperate with the Japanese military in maintaining public order.

"Anyone who obstructs our public order and security operations will be regarded by our military as an enemy of the people and will be dealt with in the most severe manner in accordance with military law."

### Japanese Prime Minister Suzuki Broadcasts to the Nation

Tokyo, 15th (Central News Agency Telegram) – Prime Minister Suzuki broadcast to the Japanese nation at 7:00 PM on the 15th, briefly stating that with the Imperial Rescript issued, the direction for the nation from now on has been set. The difficult future can only be pioneered through the efforts of the people. From now on, the people should wholeheartedly maintain the national polity, and internal strife and rash actions should be strictly avoided. In the future, we must always do our utmost to rescue the families of war victims and wounded soldiers.

Tokyo, 15th (Central News Agency Telegram) – After the Emperor decided to end the Greater East Asia War on the 14th, Prime Minister Suzuki issued the following Cabinet Edict:

Today, we respectfully receive the Imperial Rescript. The Empire has been engaged in the Greater East Asia War for nearly four years. Now, His Majesty has taken extraordinary measures to end the war, for which we, as subjects, are filled with unspeakable fear. Since the beginning of the war, countless soldiers have exposed their bones in foreign lands, and the damage to the homeland and the sacrifices of the innocent have reached their limits. The purpose of the war cannot be achieved, and the war situation is not necessarily favorable. Furthermore, a new type of bomb with unprecedented destructive power in the history of science has been used, causing a dramatic change in the war situation. Following the Soviet Union's declaration of war on the Empire on the 9th, the Empire has encountered unprecedented difficulties. His Majesty, in his boundless concern for world peace and the well-being of his subjects, has issued a rescript. Now that the Imperial decision has been made, the path that we, as his subjects, should follow is clear. The Empire's future will therefore be even more difficult, and the people must endure hardship. However, the Empire must, through the fruits of this endurance, pioneer the nation's future destiny. With a heart full of tears, I swear to my compatriots that what the people should do today is only to maintain the national polity. We must not cling to the past, suspect each other, or engage in internal strife, allowing others to take advantage of us, or be swayed by emotions and act rashly, betraying trust in the world. Furthermore, we must do our utmost to support the bereaved families of those who died in battle and war victims, as well as wounded soldiers. The government promises to work diligently and strive diligently with the people to embody the Emperor's will and restore national prestige to live up to the legacy of our ancestors. Furthermore, one more thing that should be said at this time is regarding the task of officials in this difficult situation. His Majesty the Emperor proclaimed, "I deeply understand the feelings of you, my subjects." I hope that officials will follow this benevolent Imperial will and become pioneers in arousing the spirit of revival.

Editorial

### Calm and Composure

Yesterday, this newspaper discussed how ordinary citizens should respond to the environment, emphasizing that calm and composure are the most important things. This is what is meant by "responding to all changes with immutability." Of course, this method of dealing with changes in the situation, whether it is a reversal or a smooth transition, cannot be ignored. Especially when turning from adversity to prosperity, it is easy to arouse pride and agitation in people's hearts, and the results of pride and agitation are often enough to spoil things. Moreover, the affairs of the local area, society, and country are more important than personal affairs. Therefore, in times of changing circumstances, avoid recklessness and restlessness. Only by ensuring that everyone knows how to be calm, everyone maintains order, everyone stays in their position, and everyone fulfills their duties, can we stabilize the changes in the situation in a calm and dutiful manner, which is beneficial to both private and public interests. Only then can we be considered citizens of the new era, and can we stand firm in the new society of the future.

Indeed, the current situation is in a period of transition, and emotional excitement is, of course, human nature. However, we must have rational excitement, not emotional excitement. Emotional excitement is agitation, which only leads to mistakes and cannot accomplish anything. Rational excitement is calm. Although the heart is excited, the outward appearance must be calm. Reason restrains emotion, so that we can shoulder heavy responsibilities and go far.

Secondly, during times of fluctuating circumstances, due to the stimulation of interests, people are prone to a state of unease. Unease leads to panic, and panic leads to agitation. The former is emotional agitation, manifested in reckless behavior; the latter is psychological agitation, manifested in the economic sphere. Now the situation has reached a turning point, and there is no room for speculation or rumors. At the same time, there are many areas where we need each of our people to stay in their positions and work hard. We must not engage in agitated behavior again. We must be calm and composed and overcome this difficult situation together. As far as this city is concerned, we can solemnly inform the citizens that, first, regarding the value of the Central Reserve Certificates (CRC) that everyone is concerned about, the relevant authorities have already discussed a stabilization plan. Yesterday, the Central Reserve authorities also announced the total amount of issuance and the amount of reserves. Therefore, the value of the Central Reserve Certificates can now be calculated definitively and is not as panic-stricken as the general public's psychology suggests. Second, regarding local public order, both China and Japan have already directly and indirectly discussed concrete and effective ways to maintain it in this situation. As long as all citizens can be calm and cooperative with a heart that loves the country and the local area, and do not allow unscrupulous elements to take the opportunity to stir up trouble, problems can absolutely be avoided.

These two most pressing problems already have fairly reliable solutions. Each of us citizens can dispel the unnecessary dark clouds in our hearts, abandon unnecessary doubts, and be content and do what a good citizen should do. At the same time, the country and society especially hope that every citizen can do so.

In addition to passively refraining from words and deeds that endanger public order and people's livelihoods, a true patriot must also actively assist in maintaining order and protecting people's livelihoods. In assisting in maintaining public order, we believe that the first step should be to strengthen the work of the baojia and self-defense corps, so that the people can use their own strength to guard and protect local public order. In assisting in protecting people's livelihoods, ordinary citizens should not be in a hurry to exchange banknotes for goods, lest everyone follows suit and creates a dangerous situation of rising prices. Citizens in the business community, in particular, should share the burden during these difficult times and never take advantage of any opportunity to close markets or raise prices, so as to demonstrate the moral heart of a merchant. If people only know how to find ways to shift the damage to others, their hearts are already unworthy of inquiry. How can we talk about patriotism then?

In order to achieve "calmness first" and ensure local tranquility, the local authorities and all citizens must work together to maintain public order and protect people's livelihoods. More importantly, we must put the nation and the people first. At this turning point in the situation, whether we are humiliated or honored depends entirely on our calm and composure, recognizing reality, and making wise choices.

### Ambassador Tani Broadcasts to Japanese Residents in China: Hopes for Calm, Composure, Forbearance, and Self-Control

Central News Agency, Nanjing, 15th – Japanese Ambassador Tani broadcast to Japanese residents in China starting at 7:00 PM on the 15th. The original text is as follows: "At noon today, His Majesty the Emperor personally broadcast, bestowing the Imperial Rescript upon 100 million compatriots. I am truly terrified. In the face of this unprecedented national crisis, we listened to the Imperial voice and, in addition to grief, felt our spirits doubled. This time, the Imperial Government, in order to save the nation from destruction and civilization from ruin, has accepted the Potsdam Declaration. By accepting this, Japan, with its 2,600-year glorious history, will from now on step onto a thorny path of unprecedented hardship and trials, which has been placed upon our shoulders. The Yamato race, born to live and die, must maintain the national polity, make the greatest endurance, seek the peace of the Imperial nation for all ages, and exert the spirit of the nation. This is the time to do so. History is a long history. In this long history, if we can embrace this spirit, uphold the pride and tradition of a glorious nation, and devote all our efforts to move forward, we firmly believe that there will be a future. The national difficulties that compatriots in foreign lands will encounter in the future will be greater than those encountered by compatriots in the homeland. We should overcome them with greater courage, and the country will do its utmost to ensure the protection of the lives and property of its overseas residents. I hope that everyone will maintain a calm attitude, exert the Japanese spirit, and devote their sincerity to serving the public. In particular, we must be wary of acting rashly out of emotion and bringing disaster upon ourselves. To reiterate, the spirit of the new policy towards China must remain unchanged. Respond to change with immutability. It is most important that everyone stays in their positions. If we are deceived by emotion and destroy production facilities, we will not only be betraying the Imperial Edict but also harming the future of the nation. In short, from now on, we should remember every word of the Imperial Rescript and act in accordance with it in our daily lives. As the Imperial Rescript states, the Land of the Gods will surely not perish, and righteousness will surely be seen again. I sincerely hope that the overseas Chinese in China will be calm, composed, forbearing, and self-controlled, embody the Imperial will, and adopt an attitude that is not shameful to China or foreign countries."

### Advocating Eating Beans (1)

— Shanghai St. John's University College of Agriculture

When rice and wheat are scarce, the best substitute grains are soybeans and broad beans. Soybeans were anciently called "Rongshu," because the color of the beans varies in green, yellow, black, and white. Commonly named yellow beans, green beans, and black beans, the academic name "soybean" is more reasonable than naming them simply by color.

Soybeans originated in China, with a cultivation history of over 5,000 years. Since China participated in the Vienna World Exposition in Austria in 1873, Chinese soybeans have become known throughout the world. Broad beans, also known as "Hudou," are among the oldest cultivated leguminous crops, originating in Southeast Asia. They are named "broad beans" because they ripen during silkworm season. Some say they are named for the shape of their pods, which resemble silkworms.

China has always used soybeans and broad beans as famine-relief crops when rice and grains are scarce. This is repeatedly mentioned in ancient agricultural texts. The book by Fan Shengzhi says: "Soybeans are suitable for preserving the year and were the ancient way to prepare for lean years." Wang Zhen's "Book of Agriculture" states: "Soybeans are edible and can fill hunger, making them useful for lean years." "Compendium of Materia Medica" records: "Zhang Qian, when sent to foreign countries, obtained broad bean seeds and brought them back. The people of Sichuan collected their seeds to prepare for famine." The biography of Feng Yi in the "Book of Later Han" says, "Emperor Guangwu told his generals, 'Yesterday, I had Gongsun's bean porridge, which relieved both hunger and cold.'" Wang Zhen's "Book of Agriculture" also states, "Broad beans are the earliest among all grains, can be steamed, boiled, and are easy to eat, replacing new rice and filling the stomach." Mr. Xuan Hu said, "Broad beans are extremely helpful in relieving the urgency of farmers and are not eaten by locusts." Due to their wide range of uses, many European and American countries now cultivate these beans.

Nutritional Value

Soybeans, broad beans, peas, peanuts, etc., all belong to leguminous crops in botany, and their nutritional values are roughly similar. The protein content is extremely rich. Soybeans contain about 34%, and the fat content is also high, accounting for about 17%. At the same time, carbohydrates (i.e., sugars, starches, and fibers) are also abundant. According to nutritional value calculations, fat is equivalent to two and a quarter times the carbohydrates during digestion. After soybeans are fully mature, the starch content is almost zero. Among the ash content of beans, iron and potassium are particularly abundant, with potassium phosphate accounting for about 80%. In ordinary food, starches and other carbohydrates are mostly abundant, which can supply the human body with sufficient carbon. However, the most important nitrogenous component is lacking in most foods, except for legumes, where it is particularly abundant. Therefore, to supplement these essential nutrients, one must eat more beans. The nitrogenous component in beans is in the form of plant casein, similar to casein in milk. According to chemical analysis, leguminous crops, in addition to containing a suitable amount of starch, also have extremely rich protein and fat components, no less than excellent beef. If the nutritional calories are compared pound for pound, soybeans and broad beans are more nutritious than meat and grains. More than sixty years ago, Mr. Moleschott stated, "Peas surpass beef, soybeans surpass pigeon meat, and any kind of meat is far behind." Therefore, bean foods are superior to meat. According to Mr. Voit's research, the nourishing components in bean foods are mostly contained in cells surrounded by coarse fiber, so they are not easily completely digested and absorbed by the stomach and intestines immediately after eating, thus providing a feeling of fullness. Mr. Galen's testimony also proves that "bean foods are not as easily digested as other foods, and eating them easily leads to nightmares." Therefore, this type of food is very suitable for manual laborers, such as students, soldiers, workers, and those who work outdoors, because it is filling and also nourishing. Mr. Hoffman conducted a digestive test on bean foods and meat foods in the human body. The results showed that within the same digestion time, the digestion rate of protein in beans was 53%, while the digestion rate in meat was 82.3%. Therefore, the digestion time of protein in beans is slower than that in meat. According to Mr. Woroshiloff's "Comparative Digestion Test," the digestion time of protein in bean foods is two to three times slower than that of protein in meat.

The nutritional value of food can be divided into two aspects: 1) Nourishing the internal tissues of the body; 2) Providing energy to the body. Foods rich in protein are called nitrogenous foods and are specifically for the growth and development of the body's internal tissues. Conversely, foods rich in carbohydrates (i.e., sugars, starches, fibers, etc.) and fats but lacking protein are called carbonaceous foods and are specifically for providing fuel for the body, generating heat and energy, and increasing the body's fat content. Bean foods not only contain particularly rich protein but also have a high fat content, making them extremely valuable foods nutritionally. They are also mentioned in many ancient Chinese books. "Compendium of Materia Medica" states: "Soybeans and broad beans are sweet, neutral, and non-toxic; prolonged consumption can make the body heavy." It also says: "Eating soybeans and broad beans can relieve famine and hunger, and benefit the stomach and internal organs." "Records of Diverse Matters" states: "A person who eats beans for three years will become heavy and have difficulty moving." "Secret Records for Prolonging Life" contains: "Eating soybeans can grow muscles, improve complexion, fill bone marrow, increase strength, and replenish deficiencies."

Composition Comparison

Here is a comparison of the composition of various foods to show the importance of bean foods:

Secretary-General Luo's Instructions

Secretary-General Luo's instructions, in brief, stated: "In today's hot weather, at a time when the situation is extremely tense, your taking the time to attend this meeting fully demonstrates your spirit of serving the local community, which is deeply gratifying. I deeply feel that in the current situation, the responsibility of our Baojia has become particularly heavy. Shanghai is not only a major city in China but also one of the major cities in the world of East Asia. In recent years, many cities in the world have suffered destruction or devastation due to war. However, Shanghai has remained relatively intact during this severe period, maintaining its status. Although the people's lives are quite difficult, they are still able to live in peace, which should be a blessing for the citizens of the city. Therefore, in the future, we, especially the Baojia personnel of the civil organizations, should grit our teeth and take on the responsibility of maintaining local security, ensuring that there is not the slightest bit of destruction, and completing the task safely. At the same time, I deeply believe that every citizen is willing to protect the security of Shanghai. Looking back on my tenure in Shanghai for several months, although I have not made any outstanding contributions to the local community, I have strived to maintain local order. I hope that at this time, you will spare no effort, endure hardship, and concentrate your energy to defend Shanghai with all your might, and strive to maintain it until the very end. If there are those who disrupt the security, we will not hesitate to shed blood to stop them, until the very last moment. Shanghai is Shanghai of China, and it is also Shanghai of five million citizens. We should remain calm, united, and serve the country with conscience. As long as we are true to ourselves and true to the country, we will have no regrets. Today, with the most sincere and firm determination, I deeply hope that everyone will jointly defend Shanghai, protect the lives and property of five million people, and preserve the vitality of China. I am willing to follow behind you all, and do my best to maintain Shanghai, and will never retreat. As the saying goes, 'Unity is strength.' With this determination, we will achieve a situation where human determination overcomes fire, do our best to protect ourselves with human power, create an environment, and remain steadfast every second. I am willing to start again with a new concept, and further strengthen our efforts."

Director Gu's Instructions at the Baojia Office

Director Gu of the Baojia Office stated briefly in his instructions: "In view of the current emergency situation, we are convening this special meeting again. The level of Baojia work today is generally viewed favorably in public opinion, which is the result of everyone's joint efforts. My work in the Baojia is not to build bridges for the office but to seek greater progress and political enlightenment for China. In the past, everyone has worked hard in Baojia work, striving to serve the local community, and has made some achievements. In the future, we should strengthen our efforts to maintain the local community. All countries in the world strive to ensure that their people live and work in peace and contentment, and the Baojia work is based on this aim, to promote social tranquility and benefit the future of the country and the nation. Our aim is to focus only on cultivating and not asking about the harvest. We deeply believe that those in this city who are respected and have a reputation in society will definitely strive to serve the local community and contribute to the country and the nation. I hope that everyone will uphold the purpose of serving the local community and preserving vitality, and guide the people. At this time of tense situation, we must strive to maintain the security of Shanghai, turn the efforts of the past into fruits today, and complete the final Baojia mission."

Mr. Luo Junqiang has been appointed to concurrently serve as the Director of the Municipal Police Bureau. It is reported that Mr. Luo will arrive at the bureau today (the 16th) to take charge.

Police Bureau Intensifies Security

In view of the new developments in the situation, the Municipal Police Bureau, in order to prevent general illegal activities and maintain order, has continued its mission, intensified security, ordered all sub-bureaus, teams, and stations to mobilize all officers and police, rotate on duty, and dispatched more patrol teams to key transportation routes and public places. Patrol teams from various districts throughout the city will assist the police bureau in patrolling quiet streets and alleys. Those with suspicious behavior will be questioned. Citizens are urged to remain calm and silent, not to make unnecessary actions, and to wait quietly for the government's handling, and cooperate in maintaining local security. Self-defense groups in various districts are also fully mobilized to assist the military and police in maintaining local security.

### Gatherings and Associations Must Be Permitted

Yesterday, the authorities of this city issued an order to the military and police organs that, starting from August 16, no gatherings or associations will be allowed in the Shanghai area without the permission of the Police Bureau, in order to prevent villains from taking the opportunity to disturb public order.

### Re-election of the Money Industry Treasury Postponed

It was originally planned to hold a general membership meeting in early September to handle the re-election of directors and supervisors. It is understood that the association and treasury have decided to postpone the general meeting due to insufficient preparation procedures.

### The Most Meaningful Act of Charity Is to Cheerfully Solicit Tuition Aid

With the start of the autumn semester approaching, the special tuition aid solicitation of this newspaper has not yet reached its satisfactory goal. We still hope that contributions from all sectors will continue to flow in, so that needy students can receive the full amount of tuition aid as soon as possible. The merit of this is immeasurable. Yesterday, we received tuition aid from various teams, some commemorating kindness and others saving and donating. The meaning of these donations is profound. We hope that all sectors will be inspired to rise up and accumulate merit by helping students.

### Little Mother—Dedicated to W

— Song Lian

Brushing away the dust of travel from her shoulders,

Drunk, she curled up in a cloud without a quilt.

Picking at the silken gauze of a dream, not yet...

Tenderness lies within,

Yet a resounding "no" ten thousand times over.

Six years ago, my friend wrote me a letter from his hometown, informing me of his upcoming marriage and asking me to write a congratulatory poem to be printed on the back of the invitation. Naturally, this was my responsibility, and if this friend could truly get married, it would relieve a burden I had carried for him. I hastily scribbled something and sent it off.

This friend was not only from my hometown but also my classmate. I knew his family situation very well. He was exceptionally intelligent, hadn't received much education, but had a deep understanding and unified belief about the world, society, and life. I believe such a person is truly happy because he understands the essence of life. Starting from his unique convictions, he rejected all unnecessary worldly pleasures, and he was indeed able to extract himself from the infinite desires of the senses. But I believe that eight or nine out of ten of the reasons he could accomplish such a beautiful ethical character was a gift from his family environment: he had a mother only fifteen years older than him. His own father had died suddenly and inexplicably when he was two, but it was later proven that he had died from alcohol poisoning. Because his family had some ancestral property, his father never wanted to engage in any business, spending his adult life immersed in liquor jars. However, from the perspective of Chinese families in the early Republic of China, not smoking opium was still not considered a wastrel.

As for his mother, she was so small. She married at fifteen, enjoyed all the hardships of the world by eighteen, and since then has spun like a top day after day, neither growing any taller nor hoping to change her way of life, only wanting to raise her child like raising a pig or a dog, to marry him off and then wait for him to have a son. Originally, all of this wasn't difficult in wealthy families. Over the past few years, she has been finding a suitable woman for her son. Besides the "good wife and mother" qualities she deemed necessary, she also told me that his future daughter-in-law had to be tall because being as petite as she was, was truly pitiful.

I pitied such a mother, and I understood my friend's feelings:

"...Think about the kind of world she's in. Her son grew up in such a changing era, but he refuses to leave his hometown. Instead of suffering even more terrible pain in the future, I think it's better not to get married."

Of course, I knew that for an ordinary person, not getting married was probably impossible. And in his circumstances, significantly delaying marriage was probably impossible. On the one hand, his mother was young, and trying to secretly leave his mother to get married would prick his conscience. Moreover, his mother was determined not to accomplish her life's great goal, not wanting to pull a stranger into the family she had built her life around. I worried for my friend.

But my friend was getting married! From a third-party perspective, it was something to celebrate, but I dared not think about it too much.

What would happen after marriage? Of course, friendships would inevitably fade a little. For four whole years, I didn't receive any letters from him. In the fifth year, during the first month of the Lunar New Year, a box of red eggs arrived from another friend's house, six in total, neatly placed in a glass box with a large red "happiness" character pasted on top. My friend had a son!

Having a son was a good thing. I guessed that the new wife must be someone who could manage both traditional and modern things, able to reconcile the old and the young, and that my friend was finally happy. But soon after, I received a letter from my friend:

"...Well, although the initial idea has been broken, within that brokenness, I have something new. I have now satisfied my own desires and given my mother a grandson. What else is there to do if I don't leave? Humanity itself is the product of desire, wouldn't being more rational be more contradictory? ... I'm going abroad soon..."

My friend going abroad to study and perhaps achieve something in academics wasn't necessarily a bad thing. Otherwise, it would be too dangerous. I knew my friend's mental state was no longer normal. Humanity's brains won't calm down until they grow four horns.

Too bad, just as I expected, half a year ago, I received reliable news from another friend studying in Japan. My poor friend was having an affair, and he was drinking heavily. "Poisonous bitter wine," people have tasted these four characters. I am fortunate to be someone who doesn't drink.

Last month, a telegram from my friend sent me back to his hometown that I had visited six or seven years ago.

"Brother lost mother, due to important matter unable return, please handle funeral deeply grateful."

A coffin that was extraordinarily small contained only a stark white body. I couldn't believe that such a pitifully small body could have lived so long, endured so much pain, and even seemed to transfer it to future generations. She died, her son wasn't beside her, but beside her was her great creation—wasn't it another little mother?

The coffin was carried out - the daughter-in-law held the child, four laborers carried the nimble coffin quietly walking along the streets. If small people mistook me for her son, I think she wouldn't have been happy. Alas, friend, your sins are heavy!

I returned to Shanghai. Before leaving, the second-generation little mother shed a flood of tears for me -

Friend! Commit a little less evil!

### My Shadow

— Duanmu Menghuan

Sometimes, I will willfully do some "inexplicable" things. There's no reason, and I don't think there needs to be any reason. Even I myself don't understand why I do them. I just feel that at that time, I must do them that way, otherwise, I feel uncomfortable all over.

Can people really not understand themselves sometimes?

In front of some people I dislike, I restrain myself like a mute who can't speak. But when I'm with some people I like, I treat "speaking" as a "right" and try not to relax.

To some people, I'm as passionate as fire, but to others, I'm as cold as ice.

I love what I love, even to the point of not begrudging my own life. I hate what I hate, and I won't even tolerate a single hair of it.

Because I crave quiet and freedom, I will sit on the balcony late at night, silently thinking about things I like to think about, watching things I like to watch, like the deep blue sky and the glittering stars, and breathing the quiet air that no one can interfere with.

When I'm happy, I can send more than a dozen letters in a day. When I'm bored, I'm too lazy to even pick up a pen.

I like to drink some wine and cherish that tipsy feeling. I feel that I'm most innocent and lovable at that time. I can "sing loudly and cry," and I can "write quickly." I don't understand what's rational or irrational. I only understand the true heart...

This is my shadow, a realistic portrayal of my personality.

Do you understand these inexplicable things? Yes! Even I don't quite understand why I have to do them this way!

Honestly, don't you often do the same? For example, not being able to control your emotions, etc...
