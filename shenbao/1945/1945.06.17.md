### Fierce Fighting Unfolds on Okinawa Island; Japanese Tenaciously Defend the Oroku Position; Air Force Launches Continuous Fierce Attacks on Enemy Warships

Central News Agency Dispatch from a Certain Air Base, 16th: Due to the arrival of the rainy season on the Okinawa front, aerial combat has temporarily ceased. However, ground battles have unfolded fiercely and have not paused even slightly due to the adverse weather and muddy terrain. On the 13th, approximately 320 enemy small aircraft from the northern and central airfields carried out ultra-low-altitude bombing of Japanese positions in the southern part of the island all day. Simultaneously, two enemy battleships and several cruisers and destroyers invaded the coastline near the seas of Itoman and Minatogawa, launching intense naval bombardment on key Japanese positions. Furthermore, despite being continuously suppressed by the superior enemy's intense artillery fire, the Japanese ground forces on Okinawa Island bravely launched a death-defying counterattack in the direction of Oroku, southwest of Naha, and are currently tenaciously defending the Oroku area.

Central News Agency Dispatch from a Certain Japanese Air Base, 16th: Due to strategic considerations, the Japanese forces on Okinawa are consolidating their lines, starting from the vicinity of Kuneshi, south of Itoman, and the vicinity of Gushichan, west of Minatogawa, and are bravely fighting back against the enemy's fierce attacks. If the amount of shells fired by one enemy battleship is equivalent to the bombing power of 1,500 small aircraft, then the Japanese soldiers and officers in that area are enduring the equivalent of bombing from at least 3,500 or more small aircraft. Their arduous struggle is truly beyond the description of pen and ink.

Central News Agency Dispatch from the Nansei Islands Base, 16th: On the nights of the 14th and 15th and before dawn on the 16th, the Japanese air force launched several fierce attacks on enemy warships clustered around Okinawa Island to support ground operations. Simultaneously, in coordination, separate Japanese units repeatedly attacked enemy ground air bases, causing several explosions and fires. Furthermore, after the enemy reinforced its ground air base forces, approximately 400 enemy aircraft attacked the islands along the line during the daytime on the 14th.

### Okinawa Gradually Enters the Rainy Season; Japanese Special Attack Squadrons Active; Enemy Mobile Units Conduct Dispersed Raids

Central News Agency Dispatch from a Forward Base, 16th: The Japanese forces in the southern part of Okinawa Island have concentrated their main force in the narrow area of the southern island. The ground war situation in Okinawa has become increasingly serious. As the ground battle moves south, the enemy fleet group moving southwards had several groups on the 11th near the seas of Kadena, Itoman, Minatogawa, Nakagusuku Bay, and Naha, each group with approximately one battleship, one or two cruisers, and two to three destroyers. They continued intense naval bombardment behind the Japanese ground forces. The Japanese special attack units have intensified their attacks on these fleets since June. The surprise attacks since the 6th have almost all been successful. According to radio communications from the special attack aircraft, the hit rate reached 70% to 90% on the 6th and 11th, establishing extremely great results. Okinawa Island has recently gradually entered the rainy season, with visibility reaching about ten kilometers. This is an opportune time for the special attack squadrons to break through the enemy fleet. Because they can evade enemy aircraft interception within the dense clouds and suddenly rush into the enemy aircraft's airspace, this special attack tactic has greatly discomfited the enemy for the past four or five days. Furthermore, the Japanese special attack squadron's kamikaze attacks have become more frequent since the fierce volunteer corps forcibly landed, causing the enemy's patrol aircraft to be extremely exhausted. During their panic, on the 9th, four [unclear] aircraft were dispatched to attack two enemy warships. The first aircraft dispatched that day broke through the abdomen of an enemy cruiser, and the second aircraft then rushed into the hole. This is a unique Japanese tactic.

Kyushu's Minamidaitōjima and Truk Attacked by Shelling

Central News Agency Dispatch from Tokyo, 16th: The Japanese forces fighting bravely in the southern part of Okinawa Island have continued to fight bravely against the superior forces of the enemy who have invaded and occupied Gushichan, Tomigusuku, Senaha, and the northern examples of Itoman since the 6th of this month. The enemy's main attack seems to be on the Gushichan and Tomigusuku front on the east coast. The enemy dispatched a total of three divisions: the 7th Division, the 96th Division, and the 1st Marine Division, simultaneously attacking from the east coast. The Japanese forces in the small team area, despite being surrounded by the overwhelming enemy forces, are still bravely fighting back, causing the enemy to bleed heavily. Now, the enemy mobile units in the [unclear] aspect, because the aid to the landing operation at the time of landing and the work of sea patrol and imitation has been completed, and because more than ten land bases have been established, the mission of the team in the future has been converted to [unclear] the air force bases. This mobile unit has recently been patrolling near Minamidaitōjima, Kyushu, with a small number of warships, and has repeatedly attacked Minamidaitōjima, Kyushu, with [unclear]. Until the night of the 10th, a small number of mobile units fired on Minamidaitōjima from warships. On the 14th and 15th, a small number of enemy mobile units appeared in the Truk area, with a cumulative total of 100 aircraft coming each time. On the 15th, they launched naval bombardment. On the 14th, one [unclear] enemy [unclear] approached the coast near a certain island and shelled the land. This kind of tactic is probably because [unclear] the power of the special attack tactics, so they are dispersing their military strength and harassing various places.

### Minefields Laid in Sumo Bay and Other Places

Central News Agency Dispatch from Tokyo, 16th: At 1:35 AM on the 16th, more than ten enemy B-29 aircraft mainly dropped mines in Sumo [Bay], and then moved north, dropping similar mines in Tōyama Bay before fleeing south. Also, at 0:50 AM on the same day, more than ten B-29 aircraft that gradually entered dropped mines in the western Yamaguchi and Kanmon area of Suo. In addition, another five [unclear] B-29 aircraft gradually entered one by one from the sea west of the Chita Peninsula at 1:00 AM on the same day, moving near [unclear] Goto Islands and near Hakata [Bay], dropping mines.

### Enemy Aircraft and Warships Attack Truk Island

Central News Agency Dispatch from a Central Pacific Base, 16th: On the 14th, the enemy used 60 carrier-based aircraft, and on the 15th, they used 20 carrier-based aircraft to attack the Japanese base in the Truk area. At that time, several aircraft were shot down and destroyed by Japanese forces. Furthermore, on the morning of the 15th, several enemy cruisers and destroyers sailed into the island and [unclear] fired artillery. The Japanese forces stationed there engaged them and repelled them.

The US and UK Mobilize Naval and Air Forces to Prepare for the Next Operation

Central News Agency Dispatch from Tokyo, 16th: The enemy forces on the Okinawa front, despite suffering enormous sacrifices from the continued fierce attacks of the Japanese naval and land special attack units, are still repeatedly launching attacks. It is expected that they are controlling the Japanese forces in that sea area and simultaneously seem to be rapidly preparing for the next invasion operation. The enemy's visits to Okinawa by [unclear] Spruance's Fifth Fleet and Halsey's Third Fleet, the transfer of the Sixth Air Force under Doolittle stationed in the British mainland to East Asia, the meeting in Manila between Macworth and Stilwell, and the detachment of the air force under Mia from the Southeast Asian [unclear] Army Headquarters all [unclear] indicate that the enemy camp is either gradually invading or expanding coastal operations on the mainland. Although we must not hastily make unwarranted assumptions, no matter what offensive the enemy takes, the scale of the general air attack on Japan from now on and the frequency of its attacks will be unprecedentedly intense. This is an inevitable fact. We have fully predicted that the enemy will build more bases in the Okinawa sea area to coordinate with the air force from the Mariana base to attack Japan, and for this reason, the enemy's carrier-based air force will also be deployed to bomb simultaneously. We must also pay attention to the movements of the enemy on the mainland. Intelligence reports that Mia's US Air Force Command in East Asia and the US 20th Bombardment Squadron, which had a base in India, have simultaneously moved to the Mariana Islands. We can learn from this that the enemy will launch air battles toward the mainland, which is quite noteworthy. If the enemy uses the Air Force's air force to strengthen the air force's lineup in Tianping and the mainland, it is expected that a major air attack on the Japanese mainland is currently underway. US President Truman stated that the future war against Japan will use an air force of 3.5 million troops. Doolittle also said, "In the war against Japan, we will first weaken Japan with air raids so that our ground forces can land on the mainland." Therefore, if the enemy wants to land on the mainland, they will inevitably use a large amount of air force to try to eliminate the final battle capability of Japan. The reason why they are so carefully preparing for a new operation is that the enemy has learned from the experience of the Okinawa operation that the closer the invasion of Japan becomes, the greater the difficulty and the more terrible the damage. Based on past island warfare experience, the US military continuously strengthened supplies and reinforcements for the landing forces, but the Japanese forces had no assistance, but the US military still suffered great damage. When the landing operation on the Japanese mainland is launched, Japan can use all its combat power and pour it into the battlefield. On the contrary, the US military's supply and reinforcement will be more difficult than before, so there is a great possibility of failure in the US military's operation. The enemy has been shocked by the Japanese special attack squadron, so the enemy headquarters decided to first devote all its efforts to attacking the Japanese special attack squadron, otherwise, they will never win the landing operation on the Japanese mainland. Due to this view, they attempted a scorched earth bombing tactic to completely destroy Japanese special attack bases, production facilities, and transportation facilities, and to eliminate the Japanese people's will to fight by shelling and bombing. However, no matter how the place is bombed, it is only a preparatory work for the landing operation. The one who decides the final victory is the decisive battle of the main force of the land forces. The one hundred million people of Japan all have the special work spirit, and they are determined to defend the rent to the end. Therefore, if the enemy dares to land on the Japanese mainland, they will inevitably be severely countered and annihilated by the Japanese side.

### On the Problem of Food Production Increase in Jiangsu Province

— Chen Yaoxi

On Reclaiming Wasteland: On the Topic of Increasing Food Production in Jiangsu Province

The aforementioned improvements in cultivation techniques are based on increasing the yield per unit area. Now, I will discuss it from the perspective of expanding the cultivated land area.

The so-called expansion of the cultivated land area does not mean expanding the cultivated area of a specific crop, but expanding the cultivation [unclear] of all crops. After the war, due to the imbalance of control by the government, the change in wartime demand, and the exhaustion of rural finance, the cultivated area of various crops in rural Jiangnan has changed greatly. For example, after the implementation of cotton control in the 31st year, coupled with the increase in food demand and the lower production costs at that time, farmers mostly converted cotton fields to plant miscellaneous grains. As a result, the production of miscellaneous grains increased, while the production of cotton decreased. However, using the wasteland reclamation method to expand the cultivated land area, the increase in production is absolute, and its value is extremely great.

How many emperors did China have? The Statistics Department of the Ministry of the Interior, from February of the 18th to the 19th year, based on the reports from 567 counties in 21 provinces, counted that the area of wasteland in the country was 1,177,340,261 mu. Among them, Jiangsu Province reported 35 counties with more than one million mu of wasteland. The wasteland in each county that has not been reported and applied for participation should be at least over 500,000 [unclear].

After the Incident, the rural areas were affected by the war and [unclear] harassment, and a part of the excellent farmland fell into a state of inability to [unclear]. There is no [unclear] to deny that the area of wasteland has increased. Therefore, to expand the cultivated land area, ensuring public security is the most important thing. The yield per unit area of newly reclaimed wasteland is often less than that of cultivated land due to the infertility of the soil; and the cost required for wasteland reclamation is also greater than that of cultivated land. Under the weight of benefits, farmers feel powerless. Although the government has established measures to encourage wasteland reclamation, granting a subsidy of 300 yuan per mu for reclamation expenses, the soaring prices make this a drop in the bucket.

In short, the government should actively seek to ensure public security, and then add generous monetary subsidies. Then, the interests of farmers can be guaranteed, and the economy can be assisted. The wasteland reclamation of Jiangsu Province should not be [unclear] promoted. In the counties of Jiangnan, the existing cultivated area can be increased by at least 20%.

On Disaster Prevention: On the Problem of Food Production Increase in Jiangsu Province

Crop disasters can be divided into two types: meteorological disasters - floods, droughts, and winds; and insect and pest disasters - [unclear] and various diseases.

Due to the immaturity of water conservancy facilities and the complexity of the geographical environment in our country, local disasters occur every year, such as the perennial floods in the Yellow River Basin and the perennial droughts in the Northwest Plateau. Taking Jiangsu Province as an example, the low-lying fields in the Taihu Lake Basin are more than the high-lying fields, such as the southeastern part of Wujiang, Changshu, Wujin, Jiangyin, and Jintan, the northeastern part of Qingpu, Songjiang, Yixing, Taicang, Kunshan, and Wuxi, and the northeastern part of Wuxian and [unclear] are all low-lying fields. Once there is a year of continuous rain, its production is greatly affected. It is necessary to build high field dams and dredge river channels to protect them.

The situation of pests and diseases is even more serious. For example, in the autumn of the 30th year, when [unclear] was the most severe, there was no rice to harvest in Wuxi and Jiangyin, Jiangsu. Some farmers only carried bamboo baskets to the fields to pick up the more solid rice ears. The yield of one mu was not enough for the whole family to eat. The better ones lost more than half of their crops. Taking Jiangyin as an example, the county has 800,000 mu of rice fields. Each mu loses at least one shi of rice due to the harm of [unclear]. If calculated at the rice price of about 100 yuan per shi at that time, the loss is often more than 80 million yuan. In the 32nd year, the fields in Wujin area that suffered the most from rice borers had more than 70% of the plants damaged.

Therefore, from the perspective of disaster prevention, in addition to the widespread construction of water conservancy projects, the prevention and control of rice borers must also be actively promoted. For example, vigorously practicing winter plowing, burning [unclear] rice roots, buying rice moths and rice eggs, and adopting suitable rice fields, etc., food production can be guaranteed, and past losses can be easily reversed.

Conclusion

To sum up, the problem of food production increase in Jiangsu Province

has a significant relationship to the following viewpoints:

The perspective of variety improvement and promotion of superior species.

The perspective of improving cultivation techniques.

The perspective of wasteland reclamation.

The perspective of disaster prevention.

Now, the 21 counties of Jiangnan produce 27.9 million shi of rice annually. If we can make efforts in various aspects according to the above points, we can increase production by half, which is 10 million shi, and provide food for 5 million more people. This can be asserted. (The End)

Weekly Review

### Countermeasures to Stabilize Grain Prices

— Chen Yingchuan

In recent years, the rapid rise in grain prices has occurred several times each year, and each time it has triggered a simultaneous rise in other commodity prices. The theory that grain prices lead commodity prices lies in the fact that grain prices can affect wages, and wages in turn affect production costs. The level of commodity prices often shifts based on the amount of costs consumed during their production process. In terms of value theory, all costs can be reduced to labor or wages, and these two are determined by the price levels of the minimum necessary living goods for those directly engaged in production labor. Among the so-called necessities of life, food ranks first, so it is obvious that grain prices are the root of determining commodity prices.

Based on the aforementioned theoretical foundation and past facts, the relationship between grain prices and commodity prices does indeed have a close correlation: high grain prices mean high commodity prices, and low grain prices mean low commodity prices. However, there are many reasons for price fluctuations, and grain prices are just one of the many important reasons. We certainly cannot attribute the relationship of commodity price fluctuations entirely to grain prices; however, we cannot ignore the impact of grain prices, especially the recent surge in grain prices, which has very clearly promoted a simultaneous surge in other general commodity prices.

For example, comparing the market prices of several essential living goods in Shanghai, such as white rice, soybeans, firewood, and cloth, assuming that the average price in January of this year is set as the base of 100, then the market price index for white rice in May was 398.8, and the index on June 13th was 1768.8; the market price index for soybeans in May was 322.4, and on June 13th it was 1856.9; the market price index for firewood in May was 147.5, and the index on June 13th was 631.5; the market price index for cloth (Dragon Head fine cloth) in May was 364.7, and the index on June 13th was 791.8. From these indices, it can be seen that after the price of rice rises, other commodity prices also rise. The market price of soybeans, which can also be said to represent the price of miscellaneous grains, has recently exceeded the price of rice in its rate of increase.

This recent surge in rice prices has its own complex and intricate reasons; however, the insufficient stock in producing areas, the period of shortage before the new harvest, transportation difficulties, and artificial speculative manipulation are the main factors. Due to the current high price of rice, which is beyond the purchasing power of the general public, there is a considerable tendency to substitute it with miscellaneous grains. As a result, the eyes of speculators have shifted to miscellaneous grains, causing the market price of miscellaneous grains to rise continuously, and its rate of increase has actually exceeded that of rice. In today's rice shortage, in the future, the food supply for citizens will inevitably be substituted by miscellaneous grains; however, the high price of miscellaneous grains is already a burden that the general public cannot bear. In principle, the current situation of miscellaneous grains is not comparable to that of rice, and there is no reason for the price of miscellaneous grains to surge so drastically. Therefore, this phenomenon is nothing more than artificial monopolistic manipulation, which really cannot be ignored.

The price of grain has promoted the high rise in other commodity prices. This has been proven from the facts, or inferred from theory, proving that the price of grain is the central force determining commodity price fluctuations. It can even be said that the rise and fall of commodity prices in the future will be determined by the level of grain prices. Therefore, stabilizing grain prices must necessarily start with the grain prices themselves. Even if one wants to stabilize other commodity prices, one must first stabilize grain prices. Furthermore, food is a necessity of life, and it accounts for a large proportion of the minimum cost of living. Stabilizing commodity prices is certainly necessary; however, it is especially necessary to stabilize grain prices. Therefore, we must seek to stabilize grain prices as soon as possible to secure people's livelihood.

As for how to stabilize grain prices? There are many ways to talk about stabilizing prices; however, based on past experience, we must prescribe the right medicine for the illness. We feel that the following points must be implemented first:

First, we must make farmers happy to produce. In recent years, the contribution of rural areas to cities cannot be said to be small; however, how much benefit have the farmers actually received? To make them happy to produce, we must enable them to obtain real benefits. The prerequisite is to completely eliminate the obstacles hindering production, such as the elimination of miscellaneous taxes, the establishment of public security, and the rationalization of procurement. The most important point is procurement. The central authorities, in view of the recent surge in rice prices in various places, have decided to implement emergency measures: 1. The procurement work of the Rice Control Committee and all other organizations will be temporarily suspended. 2. The current restrictions on rice movement will be immediately lifted. From the first point, it can be seen that the procurement methods will be reformed in the future, or merchants and others may freely participate in the procurement, subject to the supervision of the authorities. Here, there are some minor observations. In the past, whenever agricultural products were purchased, a large amount of cash would flow to the rural areas. From the facts, farmers did not find this interesting. Originally, farmers sold their surplus agricultural products in order to purchase the materials needed for their lives and production. If it were possible to exchange the food needed by the cities with the physical goods needed by the rural areas, each supplying what they have to spare and taking what they need, farmers would be very welcome. If it is possible to cater to the traditional concept of farmers valuing gold, when purchasing agricultural products with cash, attaching a portion of gold would certainly make farmers happy to provide their products.

Second, sanction speculation in miscellaneous grains and purchase miscellaneous grains to transport to Shanghai. Currently, during the period of shortage before the new harvest, the stock of rice in rural areas may not be abundant, and it may not be sufficient to supply the large needs of non-rice producing areas. We must recognize this point, and under the current situation, we can only supplement with miscellaneous grains, or even switch to using miscellaneous grains. However, the current price of miscellaneous grains is extremely expensive, and it is beyond the purchasing power of the general public. Such a high price is said to be caused by artificial monopolistic manipulation. In order to suppress the current price of miscellaneous grains, we must first investigate and prosecute those who speculate and manipulate miscellaneous grains and impose the most severe sanctions. At the same time, we sincerely hope that the authorities will plan to purchase and transport miscellaneous grains from various places in Huaihai and Chongming to Shanghai. Not long ago, Mr. Xiang Kangyuan suggested collective purchase and transportation of grains, which is indeed a very good method, and we hope that the authorities will assist and strongly promote its success.

Third, continue to implement household allocation of flour and miscellaneous grains. There has been household allocation of flour and miscellaneous grains in this city, but it has been intermittent, and the quantity is limited, insufficient for everyone's needs. However, every time the allocation starts, it has some effect on alleviating grain prices. In the future, with the assistance of all parties, the supply of wheat and miscellaneous grains, I believe, will be smooth and ample. How to use wheat and miscellaneous grains as civilian needs for allocation at one time, and to make it reasonable, is a current topic that should be studied to stabilize prices and secure people's livelihood. In the past, since the implementation of the allocation system in Shanghai, its achievements cannot be said to be non-existent; however, it cannot be said to be entirely satisfactory. For example, the allocation is not on time and insufficient in quantity; there are those who falsely report and fraudulently receive, and there are those who receive multiple copies per person; retailers deduct portions or allocate inferior quality similar materials; the wealthy already have many items stored, and they still enjoy allocation. All of these are phenomena that should not exist in a reasonable allocation. Therefore, future allocations must be valuable in terms of reasonableness and thoroughness.

Fourth, restrict the quantity of grain storage. After the restrictions on rice movement are lifted, it is even more necessary to emphasize the restriction on the quantity of grain storage; because if grain storage is not restricted, then those with money can freely compete to purchase, giving "merchants" the opportunity to raise prices, resulting in great harm to the public. In the past, the municipal government had explicitly ordered that the amount of rice storage should not exceed three months' worth of needs. Now, in order to prevent hoarding of food, the previous order should be reiterated and strictly enforced.

The above four points are only principles. If Changtong thinks they can be adopted, please conduct further research, formulate implementation methods, and put them into practice. Finally, I want to add a few words: everything, if you want to responsibly achieve results, there are difficulties; but from the perspective of those actually responsible for the work, no matter what difficulties, they can be overcome. There is no time when things cannot be done, and there is nothing that cannot be done, it only depends on one's determination.

### Clash of Interests Between the US and the Soviet Union in East Asia

Stockholm, Sweden, 16th (Central News Agency) – The Swedish newspaper Dagens Nyheter editorial on the 14th criticized the conflict between the United States and the Soviet Union in East Asia. The article stated that the purpose of the United States' war in East Asia is to control China, the Philippines, Ceylon, Madagascar, and other places economically. However, if the United States achieves this goal, then the interests of the United States will be in great conflict with the independence demands of the people of East Asia. Furthermore, Japan continues to resist stubbornly, and the Soviet Union has also expressed great concern about East Asia after Germany's surrender. Although the United States hopes that the Soviet Union will also participate in the negotiations, the Soviet representative's attitude is completely opposite, showing that the Soviet Union cannot ignore the United States securing its base in Central Asia. The Soviet Union's goal is to maintain a balance of power.

### Cambodian Foreign Minister Discusses Wartime Realities in Japan

Phnom Penh, 16th (Central News Agency) – After declaring independence, the Kingdom of Cambodia convened its first national provincial governors' meeting on the 11th. After the meeting, the provincial governors gathered again at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to receive instructions from Sun K'o-tang, the Foreign Minister recently returned from Japan. At that time, the Foreign Minister gave a detailed lecture on the wartime situation in Japan for an hour, which greatly excited everyone. The main points are as follows: Cambodia's liberation and declaration of independence relied on the strong assistance of Japan. In order to repay Japan's assistance, we must do our best to cooperate with Japan. I recently returned from Japan. Japan is now concentrating all its efforts on the decisive battle on the mainland. Now is the time to fully develop its manpower and material resources. Japan now possesses planes, tanks, cannons, etc., piled up like mountains. This is a fact I personally witnessed. Therefore, Japan's mainland defense can be described as impregnable. The morale of the people is extremely high, which is really amazing. Moreover, all the people are living in wartime conditions. The potential strength and the solidarity of the nation are really admirable. If the Allied forces land on the ironclad Japanese mainland, all Japanese people, regardless of men, women, or children, will be mobilized to fight the common enemy with passionate patriotism and vow to kill the enemy. I firmly believe that great Japan will never be defeated. Since my return, this conviction has become even more profound.

### San Francisco Conference Passes Regional Provisions

### Anglo-French Rivalry for Tangier Intensifies Division; French Parliament Engages in Heated Debate on Syrian Situation

Lisbon, 16th (Central News Agency) – Paris dispatch: The British government has recently been secretly active in seeking to seize Tangier, which controls the entrance to the Mediterranean, from Spain, and plans to obtain control of the strategic location under the condition of it being an international management zone. The French government also wants to restore the area to French Morocco, thus forming a conflict between the two countries. The British government seems to have contacted the US government on this issue, and recently jointly proposed to Spain that Tangier should be under international management. As a result of the struggle for Tangier, the division between Britain and France is gradually deepening.

Lisbon, 16th (Central News Agency) – According to a report from Reuters special correspondent Mr. King from Paris: Yesterday afternoon, the French Parliament in Paris was filled with heated and angry atmosphere. Members of Parliament attended to vigorously debate the Syrian issue and the international relations between Britain and France. French Ambassador to the Soviet Union and former head of the French delegation to Syria and Lebanon, General Catroux, has returned to Paris from Moscow and also attended the discussion. French Foreign Minister Bidault said: "Currently, the suggestion of our France to convene a meeting of the five great powers in the Middle East has no possibility of being accepted, and our French government only puts forward discussion. At present, I am also unwilling to make any statement to avoid offending our old friend Britain, but Britain's intervention in the Syrian event can be deemed an act of overreach, and Britain's intervention surname is also inconsistent with what Foreign Minister Eden declared in the House of Commons.

### US Troops Prepare to Withdraw from Soviet Occupation Zone

### Procedure for Changing Price Evaluation: Adopting Agreed-Upon Prices; Price Stabilization Committee Chairman Luo Issues Statement

Our city's Price Evaluation Committee, after Secretary-General Luo Junqiang was appointed by the municipal government to concurrently serve as chairman, held its 17th meeting yesterday. All committee members agreed that the past evaluation procedures were too cumbersome, and the evaluated prices often became outdated, and advocated for appropriate changes to meet the needs. Therefore, a unanimous resolution was passed: "For the evaluation of prices of various important commodities previously included in the scope of official fixed prices, the spirit of agreed-upon prices will be adopted. Trade associations will draft proposals and submit them to the committee for review and decision. However, in cases of urgent necessity, the chairman may approve and announce implementation first, and then submit it to the committee for ratification." It is believed that the management of prices in this city will be further strengthened, and the legitimate profits of merchants and the public will be appropriately taken into account. The difficulties of excessively cumbersome procedures in price evaluation can also be avoided. Regarding this matter, Mr. Luo issued the following statement:

Luo's Statement

"According to central government regulations, price limits on important commodities should be evaluated reasonably by the Price Evaluation Committee, based on applications from trade associations and with reference to actual costs. Recently, general prices have been rising daily, and the prices of important commodities have increased accordingly, leading to situations where prices exceed the set limits. This is inconsistent with legal principles, but not entirely unjustified in light of the facts. The evaluation of price limits by the Evaluation Committee requires prior investigation and continuous review, followed by discussion in the Evaluation Committee, and then official determination by the committee. The process is lengthy, and the time required is extensive, resulting in the evaluated price limits often losing their timeliness. This makes enforcement and crackdown difficult. Not cracking down is illegal, but cracking down is unbearable. This is not due to inherent defects in the organization of the Evaluation Committee itself, but rather because the method of using its authority is not entirely suited to the current environment. In light of this, the committee, in its 17th meeting, resolved that in the future, the evaluation of prices of various important commodities included in the scope of official fixed prices will adopt the spirit of agreed-upon prices, with trade associations drafting proposals and submitting them to the committee for review and decision. However, in cases of urgent necessity, the chairman may approve and announce implementation first, and then submit it to the Price Evaluation Committee for subsequent ratification, so that merchants will not be affected by excessively low price limits, and crackdowns can be precisely prepared. However, this action by the committee does not diminish the inherent authority of the Evaluation Committee in the slightest; it merely assigns greater responsibility to the trade associations. It is hoped that the various trade associations will conduct thorough investigations and careful discussions in formulating reasonable prices, and attach accurate supporting documents. The committee will promptly approve and announce all those it deems reasonable. Special attention must be paid to implementation, so that crackdowns can be further strengthened and the past abuses of discussion without action can be completely eliminated. Should anyone abuse their authority to deliberately raise prices in an attempt to obfuscate and profit, all responsible persons of the association shall bear joint and several liability and will be severely punished according to the law without leniency. Once price limits have been approved and announced, merchants and the public must comply and may not exceed them. In addition to strict crackdowns by the economic security police of the police department, this statement is hereby issued."

### Eight Kinds of Coarse Grains: Sold at Parity Prices Starting Today; Limited to Five Jin Per Person

Recently, rice prices have soared, and the prices of coarse grains have also been rising continuously. The future of food security in this city has reached a serious stage, causing concern among informed individuals. The municipal authorities are currently making every effort to procure coarse grains and improve transportation in order to stabilize the people's food supply. It is reported that the responsible persons and members of the city's Coarse Grain Trade Association, fearing that grain prices will continue to rise and affect people's livelihoods and social order, have designated eight kinds of coarse grains, such as red beans, that can replace rice, and have submitted proposed parity prices to the Economic Bureau for approval and implementation. The Economic Bureau believes that these merchants are deeply aware of the righteousness and deserve commendation, and has approved a trial implementation, provisionally scheduled to begin on the 17th of this month. Citizens may purchase five jin per person with a residence permit, for a period of fifteen days. The prices in the list should be reviewed every three days, and adjustments may be made at any time if special circumstances arise. The Coarse Grain Trade Association has been instructed to inform its members to comply and distribute parity grains widely to alleviate the people's food shortage. This matter concerns the livelihoods of all citizens. It is hoped that other daily necessities industries will quickly follow suit and continue the coarse grain industry's initiative to automatically implement parity prices.

### Rice Prices in This City: Stop Rising and Fall Back

The National Government, in order to suppress rice prices and improve supply channels, has implemented emergency measures, deciding to halt procurement work by all controlled agencies and abolish restrictions on rice and grain movement. At the same time, Allied authorities have also decided to cooperate with the National Government's measures and stop purchasing military rice. Upon hearing this news, all sectors of the city expressed support for the government's wise measures. Yesterday, rice prices immediately stopped rising and fell back. It is hoped that the people's livelihood can be restored in the shortest period of time. It is learned that the relevant Needs Bureau has dispatched personnel to thoroughly investigate illegal merchants who secretly stockpile and hoard, in order to prevent rice merchants from taking advantage of the permitted free procurement and transportation opportunities. At the same time, the Central Reserve Bank is strictly inspecting financial institutions to prevent loans from being used to privately hoard rice and grain.

### Narrow Bed Sheets and Curtain Fabric: Approved for Exemption from Purchase

Since its reorganization, the Cotton Industry Control Committee of the Business Control Association has, in accordance with the provisions of the organizational regulations, taken over the Temporary Management Committee for Purchased Yarn and Cloth of the Business Control Association, and established a department to handle the unfinished matters of previously purchased yarn and cloth. It is now learned that the committee recently received requests from various yarn and cloth manufacturers to exempt narrow bed sheets and curtain fabric from purchase. After submitting the matter to the Executive Yuan for review and approval, it has been approved for exemption from purchase. The committee has begun processing the application procedures, and in consideration of the difficulties faced by merchants, it has decided to expedite the application procedures for yarn and cloth merchants. Applications will be accepted and processed immediately upon arrival. It is hoped that yarn and cloth merchants will not be misled and exploited by intermediaries.

### Police Bureau Holds Judicial Conference

The Third Division of the Municipal Police Bureau, in order to strengthen judicial work and promote crime prevention, convened its fourth judicial liaison meeting yesterday (16th) at the Police Bureau's seventh floor. The meeting was presided over by the Chief of the Third Division, Li Shiyu, and the Deputy Chief, Xian Erlang. Officials from judicial organs such as the Shanghai Branch of the Special Court, the High Procuratorate, the High Court, the District Court, the District Procuratorate, the Shanghai Prison, the Security Command, and the Vagrant Labor Camp, as well as the chiefs of various sections and the heads of the third divisions of various sub-bureaus, attended. The meeting was chaired by Chief Procurator Hu of the Shanghai High Procuratorate. During the meeting, discussions were held on issues such as the detention, bail, and delivery of criminal offenders, and the prevention of theft or loss of appropriation orders, as well as various other judicial issues. Detailed research was conducted, and the meeting adjourned after 5:00 PM.

### Central Reserve Bank Strictly Cracks Down on Discounting of Appropriation Orders; Inspection of Financial Institutions to Begin Tomorrow

Recently, due to the shortage of cash in the market, the practice of discounting appropriation orders issued by the Central Reserve Bank and joint reserve funds of banks, and money industry reserve houses, has become increasingly rampant. Unscrupulous financial institutions, money exchange shops, peddlers, and illegal merchants are collecting cash and secretly exchanging appropriation orders, charging high-interest discounts, sometimes as high as 25 cents per yuan. Amidst rising prices, the public is further exploited by discounting, making their living burden unbearable. This kind of adverse phenomenon has a serious impact on the collapse of the people's livelihood and economy. In view of this, the Central Reserve Bank, in order to maintain finance and stabilize the people's livelihood, is absolutely strictly cracking down on the abuses of appropriation order discounting, and is increasing the amount of cash that banks and money shops can withdraw, in order to eliminate the evil trend of cash discounting. It is learned that the Central Reserve Bank has ordered the Financial Affairs Inspection Office to begin inspecting various financial institutions tomorrow (18th). The inspection will be led by the head of the Inspection Office, Zhang Rongru, along with accompanying personnel. The inspectors will check whether all cash withdrawn each day is fully used to pay customers, and the status of cash reserves, to see if there is hoarding and lending to merchants at high-interest discounts, or purchasing of major commodities. They will pay particular attention to the high-interest rates charged by general money exchange shops. If any of the above are found, they will be prosecuted as financial crimes and sent to the Wealth Bureau for punishment. The Central Reserve Bank's issuance of appropriation orders was originally intended to regulate large transactions between banks and money shops. Now, various banks and money shops are using them to pay customer withdrawals and circulate them in the market, which is actually helping to fuel inflation and stimulate prices. It is learned that the Central Reserve Wealth Bureau attaches great importance to this issue.

### Navigation Authorities Plan to Manage the Shipping Industry

The sailing industry in this city has been quite developed recently. All routes along the lower reaches of the Yangtze River and the coastal areas of eastern Zhejiang have been opened to navigation.

### Penalties for Overdue Renewal of House Subletting Licenses

The Shanghai Municipal Finance Bureau has recently announced the following Provisional Rules on Penalties for Overdue Application for Renewal of House Subletting Licenses:

If the validity of a house subletting license in this city expires and the lessor continues to sublet, they must apply for renewal of the license within the time limit prescribed by the bureau. Those who do not apply within the time limit or do not pay the renewal fee on the specified date after applying will be penalized separately in accordance with these rules.

For each period of application for renewal of a house subletting license, those who apply and pay the fee themselves within half a month from the prescribed date, or who apply but do not pay the fee on the specified date, will be charged a late fee equal to one time the original fee. Those who do not apply or do not pay the fee on the specified date after applying for more than one month will be charged a late fee equal to two times the original fee. Those who do not apply or do not pay the fee on the specified date after applying for more than three months (i.e., at the end of June and December each year) will be charged a late fee equal to four times the original fee, in addition to the overdue license fee.

If the lessor reclaims all of the houses for their own use during the validity period of the license, they should immediately submit the license and the iron plate together with a certificate from the local Baojia office for verification and cancellation by the bureau. Otherwise, if the old license is not submitted for cancellation one month after the start of the next renewal period, it will be treated as an outstanding fee, and the next period's license fee will be added, and a late fee equal to two times the original fee will be charged.

The late fees charged in accordance with these rules should be first verified for the amount, and the penalized party should be notified. A receipt for the penalty should be issued when the penalty is paid.

### Guidance Measures for Aquatic Product Associations

The aquatic product trade associations and fishermen's associations in various places frequently communicate with the Aquatic Product Administration of the Ministry of Industry in practice, and their responsible persons have considerable contact with the bureau. However, there are no explicit official regulations governing their relationship with the bureau, which causes considerable inconvenience in handling affairs, and it is difficult to implement various fishery policies. In view of this, the Ministry of Industry has approved six measures and sent them to the provincial and municipal governments and the Subei Pacification Director's Office for forwarding to the relevant responsible bureaus and county and municipal governments, ordering the aquatic product trade associations and fishermen's associations in the respective jurisdictions to comply with them. The measures are as follows: The establishment and registration of aquatic product trade associations and fishermen's associations shall be handled by the responsible bureaus of each province and city or the county and municipal governments. The Aquatic Product Administration of the Ministry of Industry may exercise its guidance and supervision rights over the tasks of aquatic product trade associations and fishermen's associations in accordance with the provisions of Article 4, Paragraph 2 of the Organizational Regulations of the Aquatic Product Administration. After applying to the competent authority for establishment and registration, aquatic product trade associations and fishermen's associations should still submit their articles of association, list of directors and supervisors, and relevant establishment and registration documents to the Aquatic Product Administration of the Ministry of Industry for filing. All established aquatic product trade associations or fishermen's associations should submit the items listed in the preceding paragraph to the Aquatic Product Administration of the Ministry of Industry for filing. When the Aquatic Product Administration of the Ministry of Industry implements various aquatic product administrative tasks and issues instructions to aquatic product trade associations or fishermen's associations, it shall simultaneously send a letter to the responsible departments and bureaus of each province and city or the county and municipal governments for verification.

Brief Commentary

### New Evaluation Method

The Municipal Price Evaluation Committee met yesterday and decided that "all evaluations of prices for various important commodities included in the scope of official fixed prices will adopt the spirit of agreed prices, with trade associations drafting proposals and submitting them to the committee for review and decision, but in cases of urgent need, the chairman may approve and announce implementation first, and then submit it to the committee for ratification." Chairman Luo also issued an important statement on this matter.

Recently, officially priced commodities have been effectively unavailable in stores, but still secretly sold on the black market. The officially fixed prices exist in name only and serve only to undermine the credibility of the law. Part of the reason for this is indeed the constraints of the real world. As Chairman Luo said, "Exceeding the set price, if judged by legal principles, is inherently inappropriate, but in light of the facts, it is not entirely unjustifiable. Not cracking down is illegal, but cracking down is unbearable." Therefore, the new evaluation method decided this time has taken into account the real difficulties, which shows the authorities' utmost concern for protecting merchants.

The most important part of the new evaluation method is adopting the spirit of agreed prices, which is an expression of the authorities' understanding of the difficulties faced by merchants. Of course, businesses and industries must also apply for evaluation with the utmost sincerity, and in particular, trade associations must submit the most fair calculations and information. Otherwise, all responsible persons will bear joint and several liability, and the authorities will not be lenient.

Finally, we hope that after the new evaluation method is implemented, the phenomenon of having prices but no goods will no longer occur.

### Enemy Uses Yu Army to Fight Against Japan; Squad Leader Shimada Gives Talk

Squad Leader Shimada of the Shanghai Japanese Army Public Relations Section gave the following talk at the daily press meeting at noon yesterday (the 16th) regarding the recent movements of the Yu Army:

Americanization of the Yu Army Deepens

Today's newspapers carry a description by Japanese Minister of the Army Anami in the Diet of the war situation on the mainland. The American headquarters has announced that the 475th Infantry Division and the 124th Cavalry Division of the American Army have been transported to the Chinese front lines. This is the first time that ground troops from the United States have been publicly sent to China. The activities of the American Air Force in China are already well known, but the announcement about ground troops indicates that a portion of these troops were transported by air, while another portion came via the Stilwell Road. This special mixed unit has reportedly repeatedly achieved victories in the jungles of Burma, according to the enemy. What we should pay attention to here is the fact that American ground troops are coming to China via India and Burma. According to the inauguration of the commander and deputy commander of the rear service unit of the Yu Army General Headquarters, He Yingqin and American advisers attended the inauguration ceremony and encouraged efforts to transport supplies and establish contact with American transportation units. It is obvious that the so-called commander and deputy commander must liaise with and be commanded by the American army. Regarding the American amphibious operations and the Yu Army's general counteroffensive in the southwest, it can be seen that the Americanization of the Yu Army is deepening.

American Cadre Troops Invade the Yu Army

According to enemy publications, the Chongqing Yishibao in February of the 34th year of the Republic reported that the United States would assist the Yu government in reorganizing the army. The purpose of this plan is to strengthen the Yu Army through an agreement between Chiang Kai-shek and the commander of the American forces in Chongqing, General Wedemeyer, and add American cadre troops. According to the structure, the American cadre troops have one commander, and under them, three departments are responsible for intelligence, operations, and supplies. The cadre troops have specialists in the supply of combat weapons and equipment, such as automotive and transportation experts, medical and veterinary technicians, and communications personnel. The cadre troops have no right to advise the Yu Army; they only provide opinions on training or assist with technical work. However, the future trend will inevitably be to expand their influence in Chongqing under the guise of strengthening the army. This is a major hidden worry for the future of China. In short, America's intention is to use the Yu Army to fight against Japan. The majority of American aid to the Yu government is used to support the American air force in Chongqing, and the aid to the Yu government is limited. The fact that they receive very little aid shows that the Americans are indifferent to the Yu government. Looking at the current situation, it is quite difficult for American troops to go to Chongqing, so they use the Yu government to fight against Japan. At the same time, America believes that the Yu Army must be militarized in order for it to be used by America in the future. If the Yu government does not realize this plot and allows its army to become Americanized, it will be deeply regrettable.

### Securities Exchange to Suspend Afternoon Trading Starting Tomorrow

Previously, all afternoon trading settlements were handled on the morning of the third day. Now, all settlements must be completed on the morning of the following day, which can effectively prevent speculative elements from buying and selling short.
