### Japan Strengthens Homeland Defense System: Implement Emergency Transportation Plan, Underground Factories Increase Aircraft Production Day and Night

Tokyo, 3rd - Central News Agency - In view of the increasing plans for a decisive battle on the homeland, the Japanese government, in order to fully utilize sea and land transportation, is rapidly implementing emergency transportation within a short period of time. Furthermore, in order to thoroughly strengthen the northern defense system, countermeasures have previously been planned and have now been approved. At the regular cabinet meeting on the 29th, the proposal "Emergency Countermeasures for Transportation under Domestic Battlefield Conditions" was submitted. Transportation Minister Koyamada explained it, and it was immediately passed, and it was decided to implement it immediately. The content was announced by the Japanese Information Bureau on the 2nd.

Tokyo, 3rd - Central News Agency - A reporter from the "Yomiuri Shimbun" here disclosed the condition of an aircraft factory in the newspaper on the 3rd as follows: Although enemy B-29 aircraft conduct extremely thorough reconnaissance, it is ultimately difficult to discover the location of the factory. Even if the location of the factory is identified, the firepower of bombs can never reach the secret underground factory. Few people know about this factory unless they are internal personnel. Inside the underground factory, electric torches illuminate the area as if it were daytime. Excellent machinery and equipment for manufacturing aircraft are neatly arranged, and a large number of skilled technicians are diligently operating them. Inside, one only hears the creaking sound of machines and the noisy hum of machinery, creating a cacophony that makes one's nerves tense. The work in the underground factory never stops for a moment. The completed parts are transported by freight trucks winding through several mountains to another underground factory. The reporter stood at the exit of the underground factory and witnessed freight trucks loaded with materials entering. In addition, there are many assembly factories in the valleys or on the mountains. The production of each aircraft requires the division of labor and cooperation of several factories, so freight trucks are extremely busy going back and forth, and some parts are carried by manpower. As a result, the production efficiency of this factory is constantly increasing. For example, this month's output is × tens of aircraft, and next month's target has already increased to × hundreds of aircraft. No matter how enemy aircraft search and bombard intensely, Japan's aircraft production rate is still increasing daily.

### The Soviet Union's Domestic Reconstruction Problem

The European war, which lasted for five years and eight months, has now come to an end. The focus in Europe has shifted to political issues. The main role, of course, is the Soviet Union. Where will the Soviet Union place its emphasis in the future? How will she act? This is what the world is most concerned about. What is receiving the most attention from the Allied authorities today is the Soviet Union's domestic reconstruction problem.

Due to the bloody battles between Germany and the Soviet Union, not to mention Ukraine in western European Russia, even areas as far as the Volga River and central Caucasus have been ravaged by war. The achievements of the Soviet Union's three Five-Year Plans have therefore largely been reduced to nothing. However, we must know that the Soviet Union had long ago moved important factories to the eastern regions, rapidly building new industrial zones. Although this was very troublesome, it also ensured the source of the Red Army's resistance. Within the Soviet Union, the call for restoration and reconstruction has long resounded to the heavens, hoping to realize construction projects better than before the war. The United States is using various means to threaten the Soviet Union, which is devoting itself to domestic reconstruction, such as announcing that it will stop lending weapons to countries that do not participate in the war against Japan, reducing the amount of military supplies leased to the Soviet Union, and reducing the loan amount of 7 billion US dollars, etc. On the one hand, it uses material assistance as bait, using coercion and inducement to achieve its own political goals. Therefore, the Soviet Union's domestic reconstruction problem is not only the Soviet Union's own problem, but also related to the international political situation, and is of considerable importance.

From this point of view, we will comprehensively describe "The Soviet Union's Reconstruction," which was published in a recent issue of the British "Economist" magazine, as well as various news about the Soviet Union's reconstruction problem that has been transmitted to Stockholm.

Floods and Coalfields

Before the war, the Donbas coalfield area in Ukraine was the Soviet Union's leading coalfield and its heavy industry zone. After the outbreak of the German-Soviet war, the area was in German hands for about a year and a half. When the Red Army recaptured the area in February 1943, there was not a single piece of dry land there, because when the Germans retreated, they cut off the frozen rivers, destroyed their dikes, and "distributed" mud and water to the entire Donbas area. The total amount of water is estimated at 350 million cubic meters. If one million cubic meters are pumped out every day, 60 million cubic meters can be pumped out after one year. At that time, the Soviet Union did not have enough pumping equipment, so it was unable to carry out this work quickly. However, of the entire coal mine tunnels, which are about 400 kilometers long, 75% (i.e., 300 kilometers) of the tunnels had already been pumped dry of water by October last year. The Soviet authorities hoped to restore coal production to one-third of the pre-war level by the end of last year, but this was not achieved.

Heavy Industry Recovery

The famous ore-producing area of ​​Krivoy Rog (within Ukraine), like the Donbas, was also completely buried in mud and water. Before the war, Krivoy Rog's iron ore production accounted for 50-60% of the Soviet Union's total output, and like the Donbas, it was an important place for the Soviet Union's heavy industry. By the end of last year, only 10% of the drainage work in the area had been completed. For the Soviet authorities, restoring the Donbas and Krivoy Rog is a matter of urgent priority, and they are now striving to rebuild them. The labor force required for this relies on the Urals, Siberia, and Central Asia, and also uses German prisoners of war.

Metallurgical factories and their machinery in various parts of Ukraine were successively moved to the eastern regions during the year or so after the outbreak of the war, but soon after the German troops withdrew, makeshift factories were rebuilt in the ruins and began operations. Other factories, such as the Kharkiv fire engine factory and the factories in Voroshilovgrad, have also been reopened. Also, the tractor factory in Stalingrad, which was the site of fierce fighting between the German and Soviet armies during the Battle of Stalingrad, has also been put back into operation. The detailed situation of the production volume of these restored factories is unknown. However, according to the Kharkov Industrial Planning Committee, the industrial production volume in the eastern regions is much higher than before the war. For example, if the production of steel plates and steel bars in 1940 before the war is taken as 100, then it was 111 in 1943, an increase of 11%. This is the result of the Soviet authorities concentrating all their efforts on developing the eastern regions in the past three years. The regional production index of the Urals is about seven or eight times higher than before the war.

Due to the development of the eastern regions, the Soviet Union's industrial production, which had once declined, gradually increased. According to Electric Industry Committee Chairman Kabykov, the Soviet Union's heavy industry production volume last year exceeded that before the war, and many factories have begun to produce some consumer goods. It is also reported that the Soviet Union has recently been striving to manufacture agricultural machinery, with the goal of doubling the production of tractors, etc., this year compared to before the war.

Electricity, which is inseparable from industrial production, is also something the Soviet Union hopes to restore to pre-war levels. It is now working hard to build new power plants and repair those that were damaged during the war. For example, the Dnipro Hydroelectric Station, which was originally destroyed by the Red Army when it retreated, is currently being actively repaired and reorganized. According to the recently published "Bolshevik" magazine: "The power generation of the plants that started generating electricity last year is about the same as during the First Five-Year Plan, with a total power generation of 2 million to 2.5 million kilowatts. Within Ukraine, because all power plants were destroyed, it is still difficult to meet the demand for electricity."

Future Trends

The Soviet mining industry, which is on the road to recovery, has recently shown two new trends. The first is that the production volume in the eastern regions is gradually declining. This is because, as the war nears its end, many workers who moved from Ukraine and other places to the east begin to hope to return to their hometowns, resulting in an inability to concentrate on work, and productivity is greatly affected. In addition, the Soviet Union's human losses during the German-Soviet war were extremely large, and the problem is quite profound. The second is the conversion of military production to civilian production. Although it is said that the Soviet Union's consumer goods are extremely frugal and will not cause problems as serious as those in the United States, it is still not feasible to force the people to excessively sacrifice their enjoyment of life after the war. How will the Kremlin deal with this problem?

Domestically, there is the problem of domestic reconstruction to be solved; externally, the international political situation is extremely complex and delicate. Under these circumstances, the Soviet Union's future trends are worth paying attention to. (Translated from Mainichi Shimbun)

Editorial

### Dispersing Vagrants

The evacuation work in this city has recently been actively promoted. For example, the evacuation of charitable organizations has been repeatedly advised and a decision has been made to assist in the evacuation by compulsory means. However, we believe that what urgently needs to be evacuated today are the vagrants in this city.

The so-called vagrants refer to a group of wandering elements in this city who have no legitimate occupation and no fixed residence, including adult hooligans, male and female beggars, old and young refugees, wandering children, etc. Vagrants do not engage in production, but their lives cannot but be borne by producers, becoming a major consumer of food and other materials in this city. This still refers to the more benign vagrants in general. However, there are also many who are of bad character, such as drug users, habitual thieves and robbers, and even those who collude with each other to form local secret evil forces, which are the main factors endangering social security and the main obstacles to reforming social customs. As for the lack of public morality of ordinary vagrants, such as urinating and defecating in the streets, stealing and damaging public facilities, stripping bark from roadside trees, robbing women of their belongings, and spreading vaccines to obstruct public health, etc., these are all disruptions to social order, which not only harm the appearance of the city.

The urgent need to disperse the vagrants in this city is as mentioned above, but there are several points that must be paid attention to during implementation: It must be thorough, so that cunning individuals cannot escape the evacuation. Strict training and management must be imposed on the unscrupulous elements to gradually turn them to the right path. It is not a passive relief effort by past charitable organizations, but rather an active effort to make them productive members, so that they can support themselves and further contribute to society.

Under these requirements, we believe that the following points are worth considering in terms of specific measures for dispersing the vagrants in Mushi:

First, the work of dispersing the vagrants in this city should be organized by the Municipal Vagrant Labor Camp, concentrating the vagrants, which is the task of the labor camp, and assisted by the dispersal committee and the police authorities.

Second, the dispersal location must have wasteland available for cultivation, or conditions for handicraft production, such as Hengsha Island in Pudong, so that after the vagrants in this city are dispersed to the new location, adults can cultivate land and women can engage in small crafts, all becoming productive members, gradually achieving self-sufficiency. Children should be given national compulsory education. Even adults should be given appropriate technical education and social education on a regular basis, so that they can all be transformed into productive citizens after a certain period of time.

Third, in organizing this dispersal, the urgent issues to be resolved are funding and talent. The former should be raised jointly by the government and influential people among the citizens, and the latter hopes that people with aspirations from various charitable organizations, churches, and schools will voluntarily step forward and participate in the service.

### The Ministry of Industry Decides to Supply Coal and Allocate Electricity to Shanghai Factories: Shipping Coal in Large Quantities to Shanghai to Increase Electricity Generation

Nanjing, 3rd - Central News Agency Report: The Ministry of Industry, in view of the fact that most factories in Shanghai serving general public needs have been forced to halt operations due to insufficient electricity, has decided to transport large quantities of coal to Shanghai each month through the Coal Production Supervision Committee to supply the Central China Water and Electricity Company. This is intended to increase electricity generation and allocate it in a unified manner to important factories in Shanghai, in an attempt to save the industries from collapse. The Ministry has already consulted with all relevant parties regarding this plan for coal supply and electricity allocation, and it is expected to be implemented soon. The details of the plan are as follows: The Coal Production Supervision Committee of the Ministry of Industry (hereinafter referred to as "the Committee") will transport coal to the Central China Water and Electricity Company (hereinafter referred to as "the Company") as much as possible. Upon receiving the above-mentioned coal supply, the Company shall calculate the possible amount of electricity that can be allocated before the 25th of each month and notify the Ministry of Industry. The Ministry of Industry will then allocate the electricity in a unified manner, create a list, and notify the Company. The Company shall generate electricity promptly according to the notification. The amount of electricity allocated to the Company will be determined at any time based on the analysis results and coal quality analysis. The Committee and the Company will jointly designate relevant personnel to handle this. The Company shall pay the Committee for the coal at the allocated price. If this is insufficient to cover costs, the Committee shall directly order the electricity-receiving factories to compensate for the difference. The Company will continue to collect electricity fees from the electricity-receiving factories according to regulations.

### Subtle US-Chongqing Relations

Central News Agency Report: According to sources in Shanghai, US Ambassador to Chongqing, Hurley, and the US Commander in Chongqing, Wedemeyer, suddenly issued a joint statement on the 20th of last month. The issuance of this statement contains complex and intertwined reasons. Ambassador Hurley is a supporter of the Chongqing regime. When he returned to the country to report on his duties, he made speeches supporting Chongqing, advocating that US military aid to Chongqing should not be supplied to Yan'an. However, Wedemeyer sympathizes with Yan'an. Not only does he advocate recognizing the areas occupied by the Communist Party, but he also advocates recognizing the border region government, hoping to reconcile the military forces of the Kuomintang and the Communist Party. As for US military aid to Chongqing, he stated that it should not be used for civil war. Therefore, the two men have conflicting opinions, and there have been some frictions. Ambassador Hurley, in view of this, sought to adjust the uncoordinated diplomatic situation of the US in Chongqing, and had no choice but to issue the aforementioned joint statement with Wedemeyer. However, this has aroused criticism from the Chinese Communist Party. According to the Xinhua News Agency in Yan'an, Hurley is an imperialist and Chongqing is a dictatorial government. They also pointed out that Hurley does not understand the true meaning of democracy and will inevitably interfere in China's internal affairs in the future. Therefore, recent criticisms from the Chinese Communist Party against Chongqing and the US have become commonplace. Looking back on the past US aid to the Chinese Communist Party, its purpose was to restrain Chongqing. Later, when the Chongqing regime accepted aid from the US, the US abandoned its aid to the Chinese Communist Party and jointly supported Chongqing. It can be seen that the relationship is quite subtle, and the relationship between Chongqing and the US can be seen from this.

### The Three-Headed Conference is Near: The Venue is Being Arranged, "Midsummer Palace" Has Been Renovated

Stockholm, 3rd - Central News Agency Report: According to a Reuters diplomatic correspondent, none of the three countries (Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union) are confirmed to be the host of the upcoming Three-Headed Conference.

### Regulations on the Payment Methods for Central Reserve Special Promissory Notes: Can Be Transferred and Exchanged Like Other Negotiable Instruments

In order to stabilize the entire financial situation in Shanghai, eliminate the bad practice of discounting, and prevent financial institutions from issuing cash transfer requests, the financial authorities, through discussions between the Central Reserve Bank and the responsible parties of the banking and money shop guilds, decided that from yesterday (the 3rd), the 64 designated exchange banks of the Central Reserve Bank and the member banks and money shops of the Banking and Money Shop Reserve Treasury will cease issuing cash transfer requests from the Central Reserve Bank and the Banking Union and Money Shop Reserve Treasury, and instead use payment from customer deposits, paying cash within possible limits, and absolutely prohibiting banks and money shops from discounting. It is reported that the payment methods for the Central Reserve Bank's special promissory notes are as follows: Central Reserve Bank special promissory notes can be endorsed for transfer and exchanged like other negotiable instruments. Central Reserve Bank special promissory notes can supplement the exchange position of the day. When financial institutions hold Central Reserve Bank special promissory notes to collect from the Central Reserve Bank, they can state their reasons and receive cash.

Banks and Money Shops Issue Promissory Notes Cautiously

The semi-annual settlement holiday for the banking and money shop industries in this city has ended, and normal business operations resumed yesterday (the 3rd). The banking and money shop industries have complied with the Central Reserve Bank authorities' order and stopped using cash transfer requests from yesterday. The cash transfer requests for banks and money shops can only be received and not issued. When depositors withdraw large amounts of cash from banks and money shops, promissory notes can only be issued under absolutely cautious circumstances. Customers holding promissory notes must comply with the deadline of presenting them within ten days. It is understood that the promissory notes of banks and money shops are exclusively for customers. Transactions between banks and money shops and the Banking Union and Money Shop Reserve Treasury can use transfer application forms. Banks and money shops can only do so if they have deposits with the treasury. This measure is significant in preventing the issuance of bad promissory notes.

Cash Payments Become Slightly Easier

Since the cash transfer requests were discontinued on the 3rd of this month, the Central Reserve Bank authorities realized that the need for cash would become urgent, so they specially supplied cash positions to the banking and money shop industries. Since the 29th of last month, the banking industry has withdrawn approximately 300,000,000,000 yuan in cash, and the money shop industry has withdrawn more than 100,000,000,000 yuan in cash. Therefore, the amount of cash paid to customers by banks and money shops yesterday when they withdrew deposits was slightly easier than before. If the banks and money shops fully cooperate with wartime financial enthusiasm and no longer seek illegal profits from discounting the cash they have received, then the cash panic can be gradually resolved.

### Gold Securities Market Holds Opening Ceremony Yesterday: 495 Taels Traded Throughout the Day
