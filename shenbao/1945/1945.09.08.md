After arriving in Shanghai, General Tang issued a written statement, the original text of which is as follows: Our war area has been ordered to take over the Nanjing-Shanghai area. I am here in Shanghai today, and seeing the warm welcome from all sectors of the population, I feel infinitely excited and honored. During the eight years of the War of Resistance, first, we should recognize that there are many factors contributing to today's victory, but the most important one is that our entire nation of soldiers and civilians, under the wise and steadfast leadership of Chairman Chiang, have remained steadfast through eight years of turbulent waves to achieve this victory. Therefore, in the future, for national reconstruction and even for the maintenance of world peace, we can only be led by Chairman Chiang continuously and eternally. We can only follow him to have freedom and happiness, and to bring the country to a state of well-being. Secondly, the people of Shanghai have made the greatest contribution to the country, shown the best performance, and suffered the most. Today, seeing the return of the National Army is like a reunion of family members and children after a long separation. The outpouring of emotion is the purest and most precious. However, while today's victory is worth celebrating, tomorrow's national reconstruction will be extremely difficult. We still need to have the confidence and effort to win the War of Resistance, and under the leadership of Chairman Chiang, ensure its success. The takeover work is now beginning. I hope that everyone, in the midst of the celebrations, will maintain the demeanor of a great nation, strictly abide by government laws and regulations, and assist our army and local governments in accomplishing their tasks. In particular, I hope that everyone who is here today is not only welcoming me personally and the troops I command, but also welcoming the regaining of freedom for Shanghai, welcoming a new Shanghai that has 100% of China's territorial sovereignty.

A Central News Agency reporter interviewed General Tang at the Cathay Hotel yesterday, asking for his impressions of arriving in Shanghai.

Now that the victory has been achieved, I am following Commander-in-Chief Tang to serve in Shanghai again. The enthusiastic welcome from millions of citizens along the way moved me greatly, and I couldn't help but shed tears.

The Future of China Holds Limitless Hope

Expressing his thoughts on arriving in Shanghai: "Today, seeing this enthusiastic situation, I am very moved, especially the pure and enthusiastic expressions of the children along the way, which make people even more excited. Although the children in the occupied areas of Shanghai have received a slavish education, the good family education they receive will ultimately not be affected by the slavish education. This gives the future of China limitless hope. We should all support Chairman Chiang, who has led us in the War of Resistance for eight years with a strong will and great hard work, and move towards the great path of national reconstruction, and persevere in preserving the glorious victory we have achieved today."

### Dealing with Counterfeit Currency and National Vitality

— Yao Zhongba

Our country has suffered greatly from the long-term War of Resistance against Japan. The urgent task at hand is how to restore vitality and cultivate national strength. The so-called national vitality refers to the strength of the government and the strength of the people. The emergence of these two forces depends entirely on the development of national resources. One of our country's resources is the vast land and the other is the large labor force. Currency is not a resource. Currency is just a value marker, not the substance of a resource. The ancients called currency the foundation of the country, and it was circulated with the authority of the state as a medium of exchange. This is what people now call legal tender, which is stipulated by the government's laws as a standard for settling debts. As for the level of currency value, it depends on the proper adjustment of supply and demand. If the supply and demand of resources (that is, material and human resources) and the amount of currency in circulation are balanced, the currency value will naturally stabilize. Currency itself cannot independently generate any economic power. Only when this is understood can we talk about the problem of dealing with counterfeit currency.

Upon investigation, the liberated areas are indeed vast. Although there are no accurate statistics, their sphere of influence accounts for more than half of the country's area and more than two-thirds of the country's population. The counterfeit currencies in circulation include Manchurian notes in the four northeastern provinces, Joint Reserve Certificates in the provinces of the Yellow River basin, Central Reserve Certificates in the provinces of the Yangtze River and Pearl River basins, and Mongolian notes in the provinces of Inner Mongolia. Although there are currently no statistics on these counterfeit currencies, judging from the soaring prices and the Japanese army's purchase of materials, the amount in circulation must be alarming. What this alarming amount of counterfeit currency represents is the material and human resources that have been extracted by the Japanese over the years. Compensating for this extracted material and human resources cannot be accomplished by simply assuming a certain exchange rate, nor can it be solved by solely taking into account the current difficulties of the people. On the one hand, we must take into account the losses of the people in the liberated areas. At the same time, the burden and losses of the entire country (that is, the government and the people in the complete area and the liberated areas) must be taken into consideration. Therefore, regarding the disposal of counterfeit currency, we should first identify the goals, establish principles, weigh the pros and cons, and consider all aspects, so as not to have the disadvantages of treating the head when it hurts and the feet when they hurt, which may cause endless troubles in the future.

Identifying the goal should recognize that all losses caused by counterfeit currency, whether to groups or individuals, should be compensated by those responsible for issuing it. Our government and the people in the complete area have no responsibility to bear the compensation, nor do they have any obligation to reorganize it. Therefore, the goal is disposal, not reorganization.

Establishing the principle: If the government wants to maintain the temporary livelihood of the people in the liberated areas, it may as well collect them for a limited amount, or order financial institutions, rural cooperatives, pawnshops, and similar financial institutions to provide materials. Therefore, the principle is relief, not exchange.

Weighing the pros and cons: There are so many people in the liberated areas, and the amount of counterfeit currency in circulation is so huge. On the surface, the people's losses will inevitably be great. However, the soaring prices and wage indexes mean that the value of counterfeit currency has depreciated to the point where it cannot be depreciated. What each unit represents is only a negligible amount. The average loss per person is not very large. If the government considers people's livelihood and comes forward to exchange it on behalf of the people, then the entire burden will fall on the government. This is a change from sharing the loss to bearing the loss alone. As everyone knows, government expenditure is taken from the people. In the final analysis, not only the poor people in the liberated areas will not receive the benefits of relief, but the people in the entire area will also endure the same hardship after eight years and bear the loss in the same way, which is not fair. Therefore, if the government alone bears the loss of counterfeit currency, it is better for the people in the liberated areas to share it. Because if the people in the liberated areas share it, it will not shake the finances of the entire country.

Comprehensive planning: The disposal of counterfeit currency is of great concern. On the one hand, it should not increase the government's burden, because the government's burden is the burden of the entire country. On the other hand, we must maintain the people's livelihood. It should be known that exchanging counterfeit currency on behalf of the people is only a temporary relief, and the livelihood of the people in the long run is of great importance. Do not forget the long-term maintenance because of the current relief. As for the long-term plan, we should make it possible for workers to work, for those who serve to serve, and for agricultural and industrial products to be maintained in price, so as not to make prices fall miserably, causing harm to farmers and workers. Then the people's livelihood will naturally be stable, and national rejuvenation can be expected. Therefore, in seeking current relief, we should also consider future maintenance.

Based on the above, the disposal of counterfeit currency is one thing, and relieving the people is another. The two should not be confused. What counterfeit currency represents is the resources that have been extracted, which is completely different from the substance of the current national economic power. Even more, it should not be confused. Therefore, we must not involve counterfeit currency because of relief. Relief is relief, and counterfeit currency is counterfeit currency. Counterfeit currency should be compensated by those responsible for issuing it. The government may designate an agency to collect it first and issue a receipt for future compensation. As for relief methods, they should be divided into temporary and permanent. Temporary relief should be limited to the amount of exchange, or the exchange of materials. Permanent relief should be properly planned for restoration and maintenance of agriculture and industry. As for the so-called national economic power, that is, national vitality, it cannot be represented by the current number of counterfeit currencies. In fact, the large number of counterfeit currencies has caused a psychological error, and the number of Kangwei is not enough to indicate the true value of the national resources. In short, no matter what, we must not allow national vitality to suffer another loss because of the disposal of counterfeit currency. This is what all the people of the country should pay attention to.

### A Few Tram Workers Caused Trouble for No Reason Yesterday

Yesterday, a few tram workers in the Yangshupu area forcibly prevented the trams from running. The military and police authorities rushed to the scene upon hearing the news and suppressed the situation, preventing it from escalating. It is reported that the troublemaking workers were a small number of workers who had been laid off by the former tram company due to the shortage of coal. However, it is reported that the company has been distributing relief funds to the workers in succession, and recently distributed 350,000 yuan to each person. Most of the workers are able to live peacefully, but a small number of workers incited trouble from the middle, demanding a large amount of relief funds from the company. Yesterday, they forcibly prevented the trams from running in Yangshupu and drove the passengers off, causing all passengers and workers on duty to be extremely disgusted with their unreasonable trouble. It is reported that the authorities here will investigate and severely punish the troublemaking workers. After all, the victory has been achieved, and the government authorities are engaged in reconstruction work. The interests of the workers should be taken into account, but the security of social order and the maintenance of public transportation should not be neglected.
