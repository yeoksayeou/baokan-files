Another medium-sized transport ship caught fire after being hit. The remaining Japanese aircraft fiercely attacked an enemy medium-sized transport ship that attempted to escape. After the ship caught fire, the aircraft returned safely.

### President Chen's New Year's Day Broadcast: Advancing Vigorously Following Established Policy; Unafraid to Sacrifice to Achieve Independence and Liberation

Nanjing, 20th (Central News Agency) – At 9 PM on New Year's Day, President Chen of the Executive Yuan of the National Government gave a congratulatory broadcast, saying the following:

Today is New Year's Day of the 34th year of the Republic of China. Recalling that the Greater East Asia War broke out at the end of the 30th year of the Republic of China, it has now entered its fourth year. Judging from the current progress of the war, this year will be the decisive year of the Greater East Asia War, which will determine the future destiny of the entire Greater East Asian people.

At the beginning of the Greater East Asia War, we cooperated in the war with the determination to share both joys and sorrows. On January 9th of the year before last, we further declared our participation in the war with the determination to live and die together. Because China has suffered from the oppression and infringement of Anglo-American imperialism since the Opium War for a century, it has always been the aspiration of the Chinese people to overthrow the aggression of Anglo-American imperialism and free China from its semi-colonial status. We have long recognized that Anglo-American imperialism is China's only enemy, and also the only enemy of all East Asian peoples. To seek China's independence and freedom, we must overthrow Anglo-American imperialism; to seek the independence and freedom of all East Asia, we must also overthrow Anglo-American imperialism. The fate of China and the fate of East Asia are inseparable, and that is the reason.

Now the prelude to the decisive phase has begun. The enemy, the Anglo-Americans, are using all their strength to engage in warfare in both oceans. On the one hand, the enemy, the Anglo-Americans, are fighting on the European continent and suffering tremendous sacrifices. Recently, the German counter-offensive has already disrupted their lines and caught them off guard. On the other hand, they are blindly trying to attack from afar in the Pacific, and they will inevitably encounter serious blows, which cannot be avoided. On the Chinese mainland, the situation of repeated defeats is becoming increasingly embarrassing, and their conspiracy to use China as a sacrifice is becoming increasingly impoverished, which is especially undeniable. We firmly believe that the Greater East Asia War, fought for justice and survival, will surely achieve final victory without any doubt.

In the past few months, the enemy, the US Navy, has suffered heavy losses in the Pacific. As the saying goes, "a reckless man braves a river barehanded." Their adventurous deep penetration, and even their gas support for the enemy British fleet in a final struggle, is to be expected. But no matter how the war situation changes, we can only strive for the completion of the war with a steadfast determination and our greatest efforts. I recently visited our ally Japan and personally witnessed the firm determination and high spirits of the Japanese government and people, the sharp increase in production, and the abundance of military supplies. The diligence in labor and the enthusiasm for joining the military are all admirable and inspiring. We firmly believe that other friendly nations will also be able to strengthen their posture of resolute cooperation, and with the determination of the Greater East Asian nations to share life and death, they will surely crush all forces that re-invade East Asia and restore our East Asia and our glory.

China is now working hard to strengthen itself and the National Government so that it can share war obligations and shoulder the responsibility of resolving the current situation. On New Year's Day last year, the chairman proclaimed the three major policies of "purifying thought," "increasing production," and "establishing security," all of which are the efforts that a participating China should make to revitalize China and protect Asia. We have nothing else to say today, except to advance vigorously following the established policy. We further recognize that the importance of the front and rear areas in modern warfare is the same, and the difficulty of their responsibilities is also the same. Participating China must be strict with itself and be brave in self-encouragement. The work in the rear is an unshirkable responsibility, and even if the war expands, only if China's freedom and equality can be achieved and East Asia's independence and liberation can be completed, any sacrifice will not be spared. I sincerely wish the Greater East Asian nations prosperity and that the Greater East Asia War will achieve final victory this year.

### Close Cooperation with Various Countries; Strengthening the Resolute Battle Posture; Prime Minister Zhang Gave a Broadcast Speech Last Night

Manchukuo, 2nd (Central News Agency) – At 7:20 PM on the 2nd, leaders of various Greater East Asian nations gave congratulatory broadcasts. Prime Minister Zhang of Manchukuo gave the following broadcast speech: Now that the Greater East Asia War has entered its fourth year, this year is a major turning point for us, the people of Greater East Asia, since the start of the war. It is no easy task to defeat the common enemy of mankind, the Anglo-Americans, and build Greater East Asia. There will still be many difficulties in the future. The current decisive battle, centered on the Philippines, is becoming increasingly fierce, and the Great Decisive Battle will determine the fate of us, the people of Greater East Asia. The outcome of this decisive battle will have a significant impact on the future of Greater East Asia. I firmly believe that the brave fighting power of the incomparably strong Japanese army, coupled with the combined power of the Greater East Asian nations, will surely overcome the difficulties and prevent the enemy from rising again. Now, the attempt to trample on East Asia has become deeply pressing. Our country's anger has been ignited by the ambition of this arrogant enemy, and the magnificent special attack spirit of the entire Japanese army is a manifestation of the spirit of our entire East Asia. If we, the people of Greater East Asia, take the spirit of the Japanese army as our spirit and work together with a strong determination to do our best, then East Asia, which has suffered from the brutal tyranny of the Anglo-Americans for hundreds of years, will become their place of destruction. Since the start of the war, my Manchukuo has used all its national strength to move forward with the single-minded purpose of completing the war and enhancing our combat power. We are pleased and proud of this. As we begin this fourth year of the decisive battle, my Manchukuo will more closely cooperate with the Greater East Asian nations to strengthen our decisive battle posture. We will express this determination in our bright progress.

Bamao's New Year Address

Yangon, 2nd (Shunyang News Agency) – Mr. Bamao, the representative of Myanmar, recently gave a New Year address, clarifying the determination of the Burmese people as follows: The fate and happiness of the 1 billion people of Greater East Asia depend on the future trend of the war. We should sacrifice everything to develop a war situation that is favorable to our side, and with an indomitable spirit, achieve the permanent liberation of Greater East Asia. In order to complete the victory, we must continue our death struggle and imitate the patriotic spirit and the spirit of the special attack teams of Japan.

Skarno Clarifies Determination

Guajarda, 2nd (Central News Agency) – Mr. Skarno, Chairman of the Central Council of Java and Head of the Central Headquarters of the Java Dedication Association, broadcast from this radio station on the morning of the 1st, with the main point being that he would cooperate with Japan and the people of Greater East Asia to advance towards achieving the final victory in the Greater East Asia War and fight to the death against the common enemies of the people of Greater East Asia, the Anglo-Americans. The purpose of the Greater East Asia War was clarified when the Japanese government held its 85th session of parliament. At the same time, Japan's independence for Burma and the Philippines, and its promise to allow the independence of the Indonesian people in the future, were also clearly stated. Recently, we at the Central Council have resolved to make a declaration to fight to the death to realize the ideals of the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration. Its significance lies in responding to the Greater East Asia Declaration and expressing the determination of the 1 billion people of Greater East Asia to rise up for liberation.

Editorial

### Re-discussing How to Practice Political Competition

On New Year's Day, we put forward the slogan of "Political Competition," and yesterday we explained how to practice competition. In general, we should adopt a humble and calm attitude to engage in learning competition with allied countries; a firm and decisive spirit to engage in combative competition with the Communist Party; and a supportive and cooperative spirit to engage in mutually encouraging competition with our own people.

The above three types of competition, the learning competition with allied countries, can be said to be the reference for competition; the combative competition with the Communist Party can be said to be the purpose of competition; and the competition between ourselves can be said to be the means of competition. That is to say, we should adopt the political advantages of allied countries as examples for our work, in order to surpass the Communist Party and compete with the Communist Party for political power and for the people. Therefore, basically, we must first compete with each other internally in a mutually supportive and encouraging way. Only when we first compete with each other internally can we find a way to surpass others.

In the competition, we should take the four principles of resolutely strengthening politics and reforming politics put forward last year—namely "Strong Politics," "Expert Politics," "Pro-People Politics," and "Clean Politics"—as the means of competition, and take the things that should be done this year as pointed out on New Year's Day—namely "seeking thorough clarity in politics," "seeking true establishment of security," "seeking practical increase in production," and "seeking appropriate stability in people's livelihood"—as the goals of the competition.

So, how do we conduct the competition?

First, we must engage in competition with concrete work. It is unacceptable to have only empty rhetoric on paper or false propaganda in words without real content. We want to compete in reality, not on the surface. Accounting-style competition not only does not help real work, but also consumes manpower and material resources.

Second, we must have a practical plan to launch the competition. This year, from the central government to local governments at all levels, and all levels of agencies, must set down a whole set of political work plans and individual political work plans that can be coordinated with each other, as the basis for competition. The plan must also be practical and feasible. When deciding on the plan, we must consider how far we can actually achieve it, and after deciding, we must ensure that it is done smoothly and well. It is better to set fewer plans that are too ideal or too large to be achieved in reality.

Third, we must set a fair standard to distinguish the achievements of the competition. Empty things on paper and in words, simple meetings, declarations, leaflets, slogans, and official-style reports, etc., must not be used as standards for work achievements. We must look at the concrete work performance from a practical perspective—how much has political affairs been reformed? How clean are those in power? How has security improved? Has production increased? To what extent has people's livelihood improved? These should all be fairly evaluated with reference to the work plan.

Fourth, the government authorities should establish a reward and punishment system. It is, of course, what should be done to achieve good work results, but how to reward those who work hard will encourage them to achieve even greater results. And for places, agencies, or individuals that are not working hard and lagging behind in the competition, they must be given serious sanctions and punishments, and those who hinder the competition should be thoroughly reported without any mercy.

Fifth, the government authorities should listen more to the opinions of the public as an important reference for the achievements of the competition. The public is most sensitive to whether the achievements of political work are good or not. Those governments and officials who are praised or supported by the public are always good; on the contrary, they are bad. Whoever is most able to gain the support of the people is the one who does the best. Therefore, the central government and local governments must give the public the opportunity to express their opinions, such as establishing national public opinion organs. Let the public be the judges of the competition.

If we can truly conduct the competition based on the above points, I believe the results will be very good. However, everything still depends on the practical leadership of the government authorities and the full efforts of officials at all levels. I hope everyone will pay attention to this competition.

### Poland Produces Two Governments

Pro-Soviet Government Established

Stockholm, Sweden, 2nd (Haitong News Agency) – Haitong News Agency reports that the list of the Polish Provisional Government determined by the former Lublin Committee is as follows: Prime Minister Morawski concurrently Minister of Foreign Affairs, Minister of National Defense Zymierski, Minister of Interior Maslonga (Chairman of the Peasant Party), Minister of Intelligence Matuzovski (Secretary-General of the Socialist Party).

Stockholm, Sweden, 2nd (German News Agency) – German News Agency reports, according to United Press news: Before establishing the provisional government yesterday, the pro-Soviet Poles in Lublin held a debate. "President" Berut accused the exiled Polish government in London of having reactionary and fascist colors at the meeting, and also criticized former Prime Minister Mikolajczyk of the exiled Polish government, even saying that he was not welcome to return to the country. It is heard that 1,300 farmers have petitioned to request the cancellation of the nationality of Mr. Mikolajczyk and other leaders of the two major Polish political parties stationed in London. According to reports, the Lublin government was elected by 150 members of the Polish National Assembly, including representatives from the German-occupied areas.

### Himmler Issues Proclamation to Encourage the National Defense Army

Berlin, 2nd (Central News Agency) – German News Agency reports: Himmler, Commander-in-Chief of the German Reserve Army, recently issued a New Year's order to the army, saying that the reserve army has continuously increased support and contributed greatly to the achievements of the German army on the front lines.

We will make decisive progress towards victory and peace in the new year, and we will achieve more than we should. Mr. Himmler then encouraged the Germans to work hard in his capacity as Minister of the Interior.

Inside Budapest, the Soviet army is still attacking the German and Hungarian army positions in the west.

### Prospects for the War Situation (3): Roundtable Discussion with the Heads of the Shanghai Japanese Army and Navy Press Departments

Matsushima: Yes, it's all about the gasoline problem.

Matsudaira: Then, Chongqing must be quite anxious. Is there anything to say about that?

Ide: Chongqing is now under pressure from the United States and attacked by Japan. Besides, it is also threatened by the Yan'an Communists, which is very difficult. However, although the difficulties are difficult, they are still very tough in words. Recently, when Chongqing Propaganda Minister Wang Shijie met with reporters, he still said that Chongqing was confident of winning the final victory. He said that the Chongqing government authorities admitted that the current situation in China was extremely serious, but they were confident of the final result.

Matsushima: Losing the battle? (Laughing)

Ide: The reason for this certainty is that the anti-Axis countries now have a deep understanding of the importance of the China war zone in the world war, especially because the United States has expressed great concern about the development of the war in mainland China. Because the United States has expressed great concern about the progress of the war in mainland China, so there is certainty. He knows this saying.

Matsudaira: They want to fight with other people's fists.

Ide: Still want to continue to rely on the power of others to fight the war.

Matsudaira: To embellish the fall of Guilin and Liuzhou, they also said that it was because the US supply was insufficient. In this way, since many materials cannot be obtained immediately, Chongqing will not win.

Recent Trends in the British and American Fleets

Matsudaira: It seems that the US fleet has not been dispatched very much recently.

Matsushima: Probably not. (Laughter) There are less than ten large battleships; as for aircraft carriers, as just mentioned, there are about ten, and half of them are auxiliary aircraft carriers; there are almost no cruisers, but there are still hundreds of operational destroyers, and there are also seventy or eighty submarines. These are all approximate numbers.

Matsudaira: Britain has even fewer.

Matsushima: Of course, it will be a little less. You can know by just looking at the speeches of the British Parliament. Naval power is useful, and I don't think Britain will work hard in the Indian Ocean. Britain handed the Pacific over to the United States, thereby consuming the US naval forces, while secretly planning for post-war events.

Ide: They want to ensure the right to speak after the war. This is of course the case in Britain.

Matsushima: Since the Washington Conference, the British Navy has been most unhappy because they were overwhelmed by the United States.

Matsudaira: Recently, British news reporters declared that Roosevelt harbored the ambition of becoming the president of the world, saying that he fantasized that the United States would have a fleet more powerful than all the fleets of all countries in the world, the largest number of merchant ships in the world, and control the world's civil aviation. This is really not enough to be the president of the United States, and he even has the ambition of becoming the president of the world. It is estimated that someone will rise up to prevent this.

Ide: Everyone wants to have the right to speak after the war. The relationship between Britain, the United States and the Soviet Union in the European War is exactly like this.

Matsudaira: Yes. Yu Jiang also has this idea, so he is unwilling to take out his own army.

Ide: In short, all anti-Axis countries are like this...

Matsudaira: Self-centered policy.

Matsushima: After the American fleet suffered a major blow to its most proud aircraft carrier doctrine, only a battleship equivalent to a human head and destroyers with two legs were left, but the most important torso was gone. Therefore, the United States can no longer be said to be able to carry out a regular organized naval battle in the future. Yesterday, the United States broadcasted that new weapons would appear. It is said that Roosevelt hopes that excellent scientists will appear in the future regarding the development of the war. In short, new weapons are certainly necessary, but since there are such words, isn't it very obvious that the American strategy, which has always believed that material quantity is omnipotent, will not work?

### US Rice Administration Will Improve Rice Purchasing Work: Committee Chairman Chen States Key Points of This Year's Work

The Rice Grain Control Committee held a New Year group worship ceremony at its office at 10 am yesterday (2nd). Committee Chairman Chen and Deputy Committee Chairman Ueda respectively gave spiritual instructions to all staff, with many encouragements, which moved the listeners. A Central News Agency reporter asked Committee Chairman Chen about the work guidelines for this year, and he kindly made the following remarks: In the past, this committee has never easily released information about its work to the outside world, especially about numbers and other administrative secrets, which caused suspicion about the committee's work. However, with a benevolent standpoint, I will sincerely accept criticisms from all walks of life. Starting this year, this committee will have major innovations in the work of purchasing rice. After investigation, the biggest obstacle to rice control work in the past was indeed caused by too much leakage during the purchasing process. In view of this, this committee, starting this year, will receive assistance from friendly countries and the support of domestic security teams and officials at all levels, and is determined to strengthen the protection of the interests of farmers, so as to ensure that no grain of rice is leaked from the stage of purchasing to allocation. At the same time, people from friendly countries have voluntarily organized rice purchasing commando teams to cooperate with the committee's work, which is admirable. In the past, the price this committee exchanged with farmers for rice, in addition to a portion in cash, was also allocated cotton cloth, soap, matches, sugar, candles, etc. with vouchers. Starting this year, the committee will implement a direct exchange system, delivering the above materials directly to farmers on the spot, so as to ensure that they are not exploited by intermediaries in the slightest. At the same time, soybean cakes, sulfur fertilizer and other fertilizers will be added to increase production. As for the general public in this city, because they do not understand the committee's painstaking efforts, sometimes they panic because of the shortage of rice in the black market and the high prices. The bourgeoisie seeks the black market and hoards large quantities of rice, which makes the black market prices higher and higher. As a result, it not only threatens people's livelihoods, but also indirectly hinders the committee's purchasing work. If all the people in the city cooperate with the committee, the purchasing work can be carried out smoothly. In other words, the quantity of allocation can be increased, and the black market rice can be eliminated, and people's livelihoods can be stabilized. In short, I am willing to work with all my colleagues, learning from past experience, and making a determination and effort of 120,000 points to move towards improvement, and hope that all walks of life will provide assistance.

### Stations and Wharves Strictly Prohibit Making Things Difficult for Passengers: Police Bureau Maintains Traffic Order

The Municipal Police Bureau is very concerned about the traffic order at railway stations and ship wharves. It has long ordered the police sub-bureaus under its jurisdiction to assign more police officers to effectively maintain order. Recently, the bureau has been informed of acts of making things difficult for passengers and merchants at stations and wharves. Therefore, the Inspection Department has dispatched inspectors to secretly investigate and strictly supervise the attitude of the police officers in directing passenger traffic, and to be more kind and sincere, so as to protect the safety of passengers and merchants.

### After the Reorganization of the Flour and Wheat Committee, Results of Wheat Purchases

Since the reorganization and establishment of the Flour and Wheat Control Committee of the Commercial Control Association last July, after adjusting the wheat purchasing mechanism, the purchasing work has been quite smooth. However, due to the rapid changes in commodity prices, the intended purpose could not be achieved. The results of the first and second phases of purchases (including wheat, yuan wheat, and barley) are as follows: Nanjing District 261.275 bags, Danyang District 26.563 bags, Wuxi District 239.627 bags, Zhenjiang District 160.627 bags, Changzhou District 190.027 bags, Suzhou District 110.439 bags, Bengbu District 143.822 bags, and Jiangbei District 590.330 bags. The total purchase quantity reached 1.937.156 bags. The third phase of purchasing work continued in the districts last December. As of January, it has reached about one million bags.

### Deadline for Retail Sugar Merchants to Pay and Deliver Goods

The Shanghai Sugar Merchants Cooperative Business Office recently stated that the 17th round of per capita sugar has been allocated by the office. It is scheduled to issue purchase certificates on January 4th and 5th. All retailers who sell per capita sugar in each district must, within this time limit, stamp the back of the previous red wholesale certificate with the store seal and the seal of the person in charge, and bring the sugar ticket fee (5 jiao per 5 liang) to the office to exchange for a purchase certificate. However, due to the large amount of payment, in consideration of the difficulty for retailers to pay, they are allowed to pay and pick up the goods in two installments. The first payment and pick-up must be completed by the 9th of this month at the designated sugar store, so as not to delay the date of sugar sales. The second payment and pick-up must be completed on the 6th day of the sale. In addition, the warehouse for this period's delivery has been changed to the Zhongfu Warehouse at No. 9, South Bund, A, for centralized distribution. It is hoped that all retailers will pay the sugar store within the time limit and pick up the goods from the warehouse, and do not delay.

### Silk Industry Expert Ms. Zhang Xian Passes Away

Ms. Zhang Xian was an expert in the silk industry in our country. After graduating from the Huxieguan Sericulture School, she went to the Japanese Higher Sericulture School twice to study sericulture for many years, and went to various places in Japan for investigation. After returning to China, she served as a technician in the Jiangsu Industrial Department and the factory director of Wuxi Yongsheng Silk Factory and Longchang Silk Factory. The raw silk produced by the two factories had extremely high standards and sold well overseas. Ms. Zhang's enthusiasm and perseverance in the national industry have remained the same for more than 20 years. After the outbreak of the war, she raised shares in Shanghai to establish the Shanghai Silk Making Institute and served as the manager. The quality of the products was not inferior to that of the past. Due to restrictions on raw materials, the factory had to close down. Ms. Zhang Xian raised shares again in Suzhou to establish the Guohua Silk Weaving Factory and served as the manager. The silk stockings produced were more durable and beautiful than imported products. After that, Ms. Zhang was planning to weave silk and satin to promote the national industry. Unfortunately, before she could realize her ambitions, she died of cancer at Dahua Hospital at Si Shi on January 2nd. It is said that the funeral will be held at the China Funeral Home at 2 pm on January 4th. The death of Ms. Zhang is not only a loss to the women's community and the silk industry, but also a misfortune for the entire national industry. Everyone who hears it cannot help but regret it.

The crisis of our national country is just beginning to rise, and everyone should do their best to save it. Otherwise, like the Jews, even if they are rich, they will be oppressed and ravaged! Educating the outstanding talents of the next generation is to seek the construction of the country and the revival of the nation. This is the responsibility of the public, and no one should shirk it. Seeing Wu Xun begging to run schools really makes us feel grateful!

Mr. Lin and ten of his friends (titles listed below) donated 2,000 yuan together, totaling 20,000 yuan, to form the "Second Beggar Brigade".

I also hope that all walks of life in Shanghai will follow Wu Xun, the righteous beggar, and unanimously take responsibility, contribute their strength, and donate money to save those who have dropped out of school, revitalize education, revive the nation, and build a group, then this newspaper will be fortunate! Society will be fortunate! (Wang Ruoqi)
