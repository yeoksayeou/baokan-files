### Luzon's Inch-by-Inch Battle - Japanese Troops Hold Original Positions - MacArthurs's Acknowledges Over 10,000 Casualties

Luzon Base, 22nd (Central News Agency dispatch) – The battle on Luzon Island has become an inch-by-inch struggle. Japanese troops are still holding positions in the old city of Manila, from Rizal Park to the Magallanes Barracks area. Enemy aircraft frequently bombard Baguio. In one week in mid-February, there were over three hundred and thirty enemy planes. Filipino casualties were heavy. Dozens of Filipinos gathered in churches were also bombed by enemy aircraft. Enemy planes also used machine guns to strafe hospitals and refugees.

Commander Otsuto Discusses Weaknesses of U.S. Troops - Front Line Near Lingayen, 22nd (Central News Agency dispatch) – It has been one and a half months since the American enemy invaded Luzon. Japanese troops in the Philippines, relying on the "Yamashita tactics" and "charge tactics," have inflicted heavy damage on the enemy. Commander Otsuto, a famous charge team leader, discussed the weaknesses of U.S. troops and the firm belief in victory of the Japanese army: U.S. soldiers are truly a disorganized mob with low skill levels. They have received little military training, are ignorant of tactics, and are no match for the Japanese army. Japanese charge tactics often involve, after identifying a target, carrying hand grenades or explosives, infiltrating enemy positions, throwing them, and immediately concealing themselves. Daring Japanese soldiers sometimes sneak into the bedrooms of enemy officers to seize secret documents and assassinate them. In the past month, the number of enemy soldiers suffering from nervous breakdowns due to lack of sleep or fear of sleeping soundly has been increasing daily. Moreover, any place that is attacked is immediately abandoned and its defenses strengthened. As a result, the hills near these places see a growing number of enemy graves. Once the reality of these charge tactics is known in America, the families of the dead will undoubtedly weep bitterly.

Nanjing, 22nd (Central News Agency dispatch) – At this decisive stage of the Greater East Asia War, the shifting front lines can influence the outcome of the war. The strengthening of the home front war effort and the soundness of the logistical base also affect the overall war situation. Manchuria has long been called the logistical base of the Greater East Asia War. To understand Manchuria's current decisive war effort and the latest situation on the Manchurian-Soviet border, the reporter recently interviewed Li Shao-geng, the new Manchurian Ambassador to China, who kindly granted an audience and answered the following questions:

Decisive War Effort

Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, Manchuria has issued a statement declaring that it will mobilize all of its national strength to assist its allies. Based on the principle of common defense, it is fully preparing for various measures under the decisive war effort to bring its national power into play and complete the mission of a logistical base. However, one condition necessary for carrying out this mission is the so-called decisive war effort. Manchuria's decisive war effort is to follow the Emperor's edict, which states, "Government and people as one, united in purpose, the entire nation devoting itself to public service, the entire national power supporting the allies' war." The forty-three million people of Manchuria can understand and thoroughly implement the spirit of the Imperial Edict, which means mobilizing the power of all people and things to assist the allies, contribute to the holy war, and ensure that each person uses their ability, each land uses its strength, and each thing uses its utility. This is the so-called mobilization of all national human and material resources.

Because of the above, all wartime systems are easily promoted and implemented, and administrative affairs are handled quickly and simply. Efficiency is increasing daily. Once a central order on wartime measures is issued, it immediately permeates the people. The most prominent examples are the training of national soldiers, the cultivation of national strength, the establishment of a national labor service system, the enthusiastic completion of grain shipments, and the rapid and convenient transportation and communication. All of these have achieved satisfactory and smooth results. Moreover, due to the implementation of the wartime system, the previous individual free economy has transformed into a comprehensive controlled economy, with emphasis placed on strengthening combat power, increasing production of materials, restricting consumption of goods, and implementing low-price policies to further strengthen the wartime economy and finances. Furthermore, we are actively considering and striving to increase production in the mining, industrial, agricultural, livestock, resource, and labor sectors to secure the supply of essential wartime materials to Japan. At the same time, we are obtaining assistance from Japan in terms of capital and technology. We are complementing each other's strengths and weaknesses to achieve the goal of increasing production and meeting all wartime needs. The goals of this effort are based on the Second Five-Year Economic Construction Plan established in the ninth year of Kangde and the outline of Manchuria's basic national policy, which are being implemented in order of priority to ensure their thorough completion.

Military Production

Manchuria is primarily an agricultural country, so military production is inevitably lagging behind. However, the raw materials required for military production, such as iron, copper, aluminum, coal, timber, electricity, and chemical industrial resources, already had significant production quantities at the completion of the First Industrial Development Plan. As a result, the establishment of new military factories has also progressed simultaneously, and they are being actively prepared to meet the needs of the wartime. In recent years, Manchuria's aircraft and automobile manufacturing have become quite developed, and production is increasing daily. In addition, weapons manufacturing plants have also been expanded, and other light metal factories have been established, achieving excellent results. All these facilities are incomparable to those in Manchuria when the country was founded.

National Army Situation

The Manchurian National Army has undergone several reorganizations since its founding, and the National Conscription Law has been enacted and promulgated. Thanks to past preparations, the conscription system has been implemented, giving the army a new look and transforming it into a modern national army. At the time, the world situation was serious, and the East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere was advancing toward establishment. The European war was raging, and Britain and the United States were extending their reach to East Asia. During that period, the National Conscription Law was implemented to improve the quality of the National Army. In addition, a military support association was established to provide full guarantees for the welfare of military families. The Manchurian National Army and the national army directly under the Emperor are usually responsible for maintaining domestic security, border patrol, and coastal defense. In times of emergency, they are responsible for the front line of national defense or ensuring the logistical base. The National Army is composed of the current central direct army and eleven

### Manchuria Promotes Decisive War Effort - Maintains Moral Peace with the Soviet Union - Manchurian Ambassador to China, Li, Discusses Recent Conditions in His Country

To this day, they can be considered the most excellent elite of the nation. Their mission is not only to defend the northern border but also to share the responsibility of protecting East Asia. This is no exaggeration. Since the founding of Manchuria, bandits have been rampant, and suppression and appeasement have been carried out simultaneously. The composition of the National Army was extremely complex. Although it has been reorganized several times and military district commanders have been established to govern separately, the conscription system was still temporarily used, which easily led to abuses. However, since the 1st of April in the seventh year of Kangde, the national obligation mentality has been a pressing issue. The outline of the National Conscription Law is described below.

At the beginning of the implementation of the National Conscription Law, considering the level of the people, the term of service was three years, and for a specific group, it was within one year (Article 5 of the National Conscription Law). The conscription age was 19 years old. To stabilize public sentiment, a military support law and a military preferential treatment outline were established. Military districts and river army organizations were established, all of which are responsible for the security and defense of designated areas.

The special units of the National Army currently include air squadrons, anti-aircraft artillery units, mechanized units, river army automobile units, engineer units, and gendarmerie regiments. Educational institutions include the Army Training School, the Army Military Academy, the Army Xing'an School, the Army Automobile School, the Gendarmerie Training Center, the Army Quartermaster School, the Army Medical School, and the Army Veterinary School. In addition, a higher military education institution for cultivating key talents has also been established.

Increased Steel Production

Manchuria is rich in mineral resources, especially iron production, which occupies an important position. For example, the eastern border area, which no one cared about before the founding of the country, has suddenly attracted attention. Since the establishment of the plan for self-sufficiency in steel within the territory in September of the seventh year of Kangde, it has been rapidly established. Therefore, in December of the same year, the Japanese government announced the outline for expanding iron production capacity in Japan, Manchuria, and China, in which Manchuria's steel production must be urgently increased to meet immediate needs. However, in the First Industrial Development Five-Year Plan, the mining sector was once revised, expanding the steel component and specially considering its production target, which is to ensure domestic self-sufficiency and secure supply to Japan, thereby contributing to wartime needs. Now the Second Five-Year Plan is being implemented step by step, and steel production has made great progress. The most valuable natural condition for steel manufacturing in Manchuria is that the iron-producing area also produces coal. Using coal from other areas for steelmaking eliminates the need for long-distance transportation, saving effort and time. With these good natural conditions, coupled with scientific methods and meticulous planning, the rapid development of the steel industry can be expected.

Border Relations

Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, Manchuria's position has been to pursue the holy war and ensure the protection of the northern border. The national border is calm and as solid as a rock. It has always maintained a moral and peaceful attitude toward the Soviet Union, hoping to gradually improve relations. It is believed that there will be no border troubles in the future.

Agricultural Development

Manchuria has long been called the granary of East Asia, so it is an agricultural country. Farmers account for 80-90% of the population. The soil is arid. Southern Manchuria is loess, while central and northern Manchuria are black soil. Some areas can be used for paddy fields. Rice production is quite good and is a food base. It has a long history of supplying special agricultural products to the world. Especially under this Greater East Asia Holy War, Manchuria's agricultural position is becoming increasingly important. Since the founding of Manchuria, the government has paid close attention to agriculture. Up to the fourth year of Kangde, it established a five-year industrial development plan and devoted great efforts to improving varieties, eliminating pests, and establishing agricultural experiment stations, all of which were actively implemented. At the same time, agricultural vocational schools and agricultural universities were established to train agricultural technical talents. Due to the implementation of the development policy, wasteland was vigorously reclaimed, increasing arable land by one-third compared to the founding of the country. In recent years, rainfall and sunshine have been moderate, and the harvest has been abundant. Last year, the amount exceeded the predetermined amount, which can be used for export to Japan and North China in addition to self-sufficiency. The Second Five-Year Plan is now being implemented, based on the experience of the past ten years, to ensure increased production, and the distribution and allocation systems for agricultural products have also been improved. The usual operational guidance agency is the Xingnong Cooperative. The Xingnong Cooperative Law was promulgated in March of the seventh year of Kangde. At the same time, the former agricultural cooperatives and financial cooperatives were integrated, and central and provincial central and federations were established. Cooperatives were established in cities, counties, and towns, all under the guidance and supervision of the Minister of the competent department, engaged in rural construction, agricultural improvement and development, and the promotion of farmers' welfare, contributing to the country's economic development. It closely cooperates with administrative agencies to gradually implement all plans, so that they directly penetrate the people. At the same time, Xingnong warehouses were established to provide loans and relief to poor farmers at any time, so that there is no regret in the future of increased production. In short, Manchuria's agriculture has now entered a stage of massive increase in production. From this vast and fertile land, combined with scientific development and improvement, the unlimited material power can be brought into full play, fully contributing to the domestic and foreign needs under wartime conditions, so as to enhance its combat strength. Manchuria, with its natural resources, has made great contributions to the food problem of the entire East Asia. In the past ten years since the founding of the country, various policies have developed very rapidly. The above is just a few points due to time constraints.

Complete the War

Now the Greater East Asia War has entered a decisive stage, and the war on the front lines is becoming increasingly fierce. The rise and fall of the East Asian nations are tied to this. It is hoped that the East Asian nations will do their best and fulfill their responsibilities. In particular, the Republic of China occupies an important position in the axis of East Asia. It is believed that it will cooperate with Japan and Manchuria, devote itself to the decisive war effort, mobilize the national human and material resources, assist the allies to complete the war, and achieve our common goals.

The Berlin Defense Forces are deployed to thoroughly utilize natural fortresses such as bridges, rivers, and canals, as well as buildings and roads, to form fortresses. Even insects have no gaps to enter. The streets are full of countless detours. The newspapers predicted that the war was about to break out. Also, military newspapers wrote articles on the future street battles, saying that the news agency may stop functioning. At that time, it will be replaced by small newspapers, leaflets, or wall newspapers. The food for the citizens is also changed to field food like the army so that they can maintain after the electricity and gas are cut off. A large number of women and children avoid difficulty in accommodation and shipping. It is said that in the battle, the workers should stick to their duties and stick to the end. In addition, the notices on the precautions and suggestions in future street battles said that the citizens' emergency court in the combat area announced on the 16th will perform its duties immediately, and those who are enough to depress the fighting will be severely punished. Therefore, the current citizen actions are only toward the final battle, and they are becoming more and more serious and tense.

Editorial

### New Developments in the Chongqing-Communist Relationship

The relationship between Chongqing and the Communists is one of the crucial military and political issues in the Greater East Asia War. Its improvement or deterioration is related to the progress of the Greater East Asia War, and we have a necessary reason to pay attention to it.

The Chongqing-Communist relationship is based on the point of "resistance against Japan." Although the words "national" and "united front" are added before and after the words "resistance against Japan" to indicate restrictions and compliance, neither side has been restricted nor able to comply. Both sides are using "resistance against Japan" to develop their own intentions, that is, Chongqing wants to use "resistance against Japan" to eliminate dissenting forces and implement consistent dictatorial politics. As for the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), it uses "resistance against Japan" to develop its own strength, while establishing a so-called democratic political foundation, advocating the genuine implementation of the Three Principles of the People, as a means to restrain Chongqing. This kind of attempt, with different dreams in the same bed, became apparent after more than a year of resistance against Japan, when Wuhan fell. As a result, the Chongqing-Communist relationship has reversed since then.

From 1939 to September 1944, when Chongqing and the Communists officially negotiated, the two parties were in a state of hostility in reality. The reason why they did not move towards a complete split was still tied to the point of protracted war. This relationship was tenuous, and we failed to open up the situation between China and Japan in time, which was ultimately exploited by the United States, which is very regrettable. The United States needs the Chongqing-Communist relationship to be at its disposal and must first allow Chongqing and the Communists to coexist peacefully before it can achieve its goal of resisting Japan. Therefore, it demanded that Chiang Kai-shek resolve the Chongqing-Communist problem through political means. As a result, there was the scene of the Chongqing-Communist negotiations in September last year. After four months, the negotiations broke down because the two sides' opinions were still far apart. In order to answer the questions of the senators and to express democracy, Chiang Kai-shek allowed Lin Zuhan, the representative of the CCP, to report on the negotiations at the Senate. The content of Lin's report was to criticize Chongqing for lacking sincerity, explaining that the Communist Party had implemented four promises, accusing Chongqing of distorting the facts, and finally attacking Chongqing's poor politics, demanding the organization of a coalition government. (See the full text in this newspaper on January 18th and 20th) This kind of request is certainly not acceptable to Chongqing, and the relationship between Chongqing and the Communists will inevitably fall into a standstill.

What does Yan'an rely on to make such bold demands and directly demonstrate to Chongqing? Understanding this point is the central basis for observing the development of the Chongqing-Communist relationship.

Naturally, international democratic pressure has increased the courage of Yan'an. Coupled with the support of the United States, it will not suffer a counterattack to boldly slash at Chiang Kai-shek. This is because Chongqing's dictatorship has led to the alienation of various parties and factions and middlemen, but they dare to be angry but dare not speak out. Yan'an, judging the situation, uses its own military and political power to attack Chiang Kai-shek, and will not be opposed by various parties and factions and strata, and bear the crime of destroying unity. On the contrary, it will be echoed by them as its backing. In this way, it has won the political forces outside the Chongqing Kuomintang, that is, it has weakened the prestige of the Chongqing Kuomintang. Thirdly, attacking Chongqing's poor politics is the reason for demanding the reorganization of a coalition government. In this way, it further enhances the strategy of seeking development in the War of Resistance, and at the same time, it can meet the requirements of the United States for China to jointly resist Japan, and also improve the international status of Yan'an.

Based on the above three points, Yan'an will never miss such an excellent opportunity. If Chiang Kai-shek of Chongqing does not hesitate to break with it, then how will Yan'an clean up the broken situation? It does not seem to care very much about destroying unity, and has the spirit of "If you don't do it, I'll do it for you." Looking at the report of the special correspondent of the New York Times: "The Yan'an regime is now considering organizing a China Democratic Joint Committee, or a similar independent agency. If this plan is realized, China will be divided into three, and the internal disputes will be difficult to resolve by peaceful means." (See this newspaper on the 11th) The clue can be seen.

According to recent news, Chongqing has made many concessions. First, it recognizes the legal status of Yan'an; second, it allows Yan'an representatives to participate in the Military Commission; third, in order to organize a wartime cabinet, it recognizes Yan'an and representatives of other parties to participate in administration; fourth, in order to review the supply and reorganization of the Communist army, a committee is organized by representatives from Yan'an, Chongqing, and the United States. (See this newspaper on the 18th) However, Yan'an still refuses. Since the beginning of the Chongqing-Communist negotiations, the concessions made by Chongqing have not been able to satisfy Yan'an. Because Yan'an demands the implementation of a coalition government and a joint command participated by all parties and factions, but Chiang Kai-shek of Chongqing is unwilling to agree, which is the focus of the failed negotiations.

For the sake of China's future, we must not ignore the Chongqing-Communist dispute and its development. For the sake of East Asia's future, we must not ignore it even more. The enemy United States can use the Chongqing-Communist relationship to continue its ambition to invade East Asia. The political leaders of China and Japan must pay close attention to this decisive stage of the Greater East Asia War.

### New Japanese Finance Minister Tsushima Discusses Policy Guidelines: Thoroughly Implement Increased Production and Transportation

Tokyo, 22nd (Central News Agency telegram): The new Japanese Finance Minister Tsushima met with a group of reporters at the official residence of the Minister of Finance on the night of the 21st to talk about his policy aspirations, briefly stating that in order to adapt to the financial policies under the current tense war situation, he had to resolve to thoroughly promote increased production and transportation, integrate it with industrial policies, and strongly promote established policies. At this time of transition, it is especially appropriate to concentrate the total strength of China, Japan, and Manchuria to focus on the war effort.

Tokyo, 22nd (Central News Agency telegram): Japanese government secretary-general Hirose resigned after taking office on the 10th to fill the vacancy left by secretary-general Tanaka, because his operating policy toward the local administration council had some relation to the Koiso cabinet's opinion. Prime Minister Koiso decided to resolutely carry out the third partial cabinet reshuffle, appointing Ishiwatari as secretary-general. Ishiwatari previously served as finance minister in the Hiranuma cabinet and secretary-general in the Yonai cabinet, enjoying considerable popularity. His appointment as secretary-general in the joint cabinet of Koiso and Yonai is most appropriate. Tsushima previously served as deputy governor of the Bank of Japan. This time, recommended by Finance Minister Ishiwatari, he took on the important task of wartime finance. He also served as president of the North China Development Company for four years. With his skills and experience, he will surely make a great contribution to wartime finance and the problem of currency inflation in the mainland.

### Candle Merchants Who Fail to Report Taxes Will Be Punished According to Law

Since the establishment of the Shanghai Special Municipality Candle Tax Office of the Ministry of Finance, candle merchants have been actively collecting and paying taxes in accordance with the collection regulations. Previously, the Candle Industry Association once misunderstood and resisted paying taxes. Now, after the office explained and urged them to pay taxes, this tax resistance dispute has been resolved. However, there are still many candle merchants who disobey orders and conceal their income, which has greatly affected tax revenue. It is learned that this candle tax is one of the national tax revenues, and the people have an obligation to pay taxes and must not violate the law. The Changju of the Ministry of Finance should investigate and punish such illegal candle merchants, and the contracting office should be responsible for urging collection and must not condone their evasion.

However, the bureau has discovered that rickshaw pullers waiting for fares are still arbitrarily demanding extra fares, which has seriously affected traffic. Therefore, the bureau has ordered the guild to strictly prohibit rickshaw pullers from demanding extra fares. If they do not operate in accordance with the regulations, they will be severely punished.

Recently, due to the impact of the war, the products of the factory cannot be sold, and there are still more than 250 orphans being cared for, and more than 70 married orphans are working in the orphanage. The monthly expenses are huge and very difficult to maintain. At the invitation of the Shanghai Catholic Charity Association and with the assistance of the Ningbo Fellow Villagers Association, the famous art handicrafts of the orphanage have been displayed and sold at the Ningbo Fellow Villagers Association on the fifth floor since the previous (20th) day, appealing to philanthropists in the society to help the hundreds of orphans in the orphanage live. The exhibits include oil paintings, sculptures, etc., which are very excellent. It is heard that the exhibition will end on the 27th.

### Publication of the "Renzhai Essays"

Mr. Zhao Zhengping, the president of the National Shanghai University, devoted his life to education. This year's February coincided with his 60th birthday celebration. The disciples wanted to celebrate his birthday, but Mr. Zhao thought that the country was in danger and the people were suffering, so he was unwilling to hold any banquets. Therefore, his disciples selected 50 of his articles on time, state and learning, which he had published in newspapers and magazines across the country in the past, and published them in a special collection, named "Renzhai Essays", as a birthday gift for Mr. Zhao. The book was published a few days ago.

### Tonight's Basketball League: Zhongbei vs. Donghua to Decide Champions of Divisions A and B; Zhongbei vs. Hualian League Presale Tickets

The public basketball league has concluded for all divisions except Division B. Only the Zhongbei and Hualian teams of Division A have not officially competed. According to the original schedule, the first round of competition between the two teams was on February 4, and the second round was on February 21. However, during the first round of competition, the audience was too crowded, and they stood on the court line, which did not comply with the official competition rules. At that time, the league authorities announced that the game was a friendly match and scheduled a makeup game on February 24. Also, before the second round of February 21, the league authorities had repeatedly planned and, in order to maintain order and improve management, specially raised the ticket prices, reduced the number of tickets, and implemented presale tickets. Unexpectedly, problems arose with the tickets again, and they could not be sold in advance on the original date (February 20), so the game had to be rescheduled, causing the audience to go back and forth in vain to buy tickets. The makeup game for the first round between Zhongbei and Hualian on February 24 will still have presale tickets. The time is from 2:00 PM to 6:00 PM on the 23rd. The ticket prices are 500 yuan for the upper floor and 2,000 yuan for the lower floor. Tickets will not be sold at the door.

Also, there are three league games today, two of which are for the women's division. The final game is Zhongbei B vs. Donghua. Since both teams have maintained undefeated records, this game is tantamount to a decisive battle, and it is expected to be exciting. The schedule for today's three games is recorded as follows:

Overseas Chinese - Three Provinces (Women's Division) 6:00 PM, Green Team - Liaison (Women's Division) - 6:30 PM, Zhongbei B - Donghua (Divisions A and B) 7:30 PM

Arts and Entertainment Fair Postponed

The University Alumni Advancement Association, in conjunction with various university students, is launching a grand arts and entertainment fair to support our newspaper's scholarship program. This is purely a charitable endeavor aimed at attracting the attention of the public. The enthusiastic efforts of the alumni are highly commendable. The planned entertainment program includes the drama "Joyful Reunion" and the Peking opera "The Story of the Jade Bracelet." To further enhance the event, they have specially invited various Shanghai movie stars and singers, as well as the Friendship Team's Happiness Orchestra to perform Hawaiian music. Given the grand scale of the event, a huge success is anticipated. We have learned that the association originally scheduled the performance for 2:00 PM on the 24th of this month. However, due to insufficient preparation, it has been decided to postpone the performance to 2:00 PM on March 14th, still at the Jincheng Grand Theater on Beijing Road. We hope for the understanding of all patrons.
