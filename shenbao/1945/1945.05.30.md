Tokyo, December 9th, Central News Agency: Admiral Osami Nagano, Chief of the Naval General Staff, has been honorably transferred to the position of Military Councilor. His successor has been decided as Admiral Soemu Toyoda, Commander-in-Chief of the Navy, concurrently Commander-in-Chief of the Combined Fleet and Commander-in-Chief of the Maritime Escort Fleet. Vice-Admiral Jisaburo Ozawa, Vice Chief of the Naval General Staff, will succeed Admiral Toyoda. Furthermore, Vice-Admiral Takijiro Onishi has been appointed as the new Vice Chief of the Naval General Staff.

Tokyo, December 29th, Central News Agency: Admiral Soemu Toyoda, Commander-in-Chief of the Navy and concurrently Commander-in-Chief of the Combined Fleet, has been active at sea for a long time. His appointment as Chief of the Naval General Staff will utilize his valuable front-line experience in military command, and will greatly contribute to the decisive battle on the homeland. The new Commander-in-Chief of the Navy, Vice-Admiral Jisaburo Ozawa, and the new Vice Chief of the Naval General Staff, Vice-Admiral Takijiro Onishi, are both authorities on aviation. In particular, Vice-Admiral Onishi served as commander of naval air units in the Philippines, and established great achievements in the air battles over the sea near Taiwan and the Philippines. As the decisive air battle becomes increasingly fierce, it is extremely appropriate to appoint those who are familiar with the front lines and authorities on air warfare to these important positions. It also shows the Navy's determination to break through the difficult situation, and their activities are highly anticipated.

Tokyo, December 29th, Central News Agency: Commander-in-Chief Ozawa is from Miyazaki Prefecture. He graduated from the Naval Academy in the 42nd year of Meiji (1909).

### Fierce Attacks Continue on Enemy Ships in the Waters Around Okinawa Island; Japanese Special Attack Forces Achieve Significant Results

Tokyo, December 29th, Central News Agency: At the fiercely contested battlefields near Naha and Shuri, torrential rain has fallen since midnight on the 26th, and the Ansha River has overflowed, turning the surrounding area into mud, restricting the movements of both sides. However, the Japanese garrison forces are taking advantage of this inconvenience to launch intense and repeated attacks, causing the enemy great distress. Due to the brave and daring fighting of the Japanese army, enemy casualties are increasing daily. According to enemy reports, the number of dead and wounded has exceeded 35,000, which shows that the enemy's sacrifices are extremely heavy. The Giretsu Airborne Unit, which successfully made a forced landing at the northern airfield on Okinawa Island on the night of the 24th, continues to fight fiercely within the enemy lines. According to Japanese air force reconnaissance on the evening of the 27th, the function of the northern airfield remains stopped and unusable due to the daring fighting of the Japanese troops who landed there. The use of the central airfield is also impossible due to the struggles of the landed soldiers. On the other hand, the Japanese army's special attack force is also taking advantage of this good opportunity to continue achieving results in the waters around the island. On the morning of the 27th, between 8:44 and 9:00, a powerful group of Japanese special attack forces, disregarding the bad weather, carried out a surprise attack on enemy ships navigating in Nakagusuku Bay. The results that have been confirmed so far include the sinking of one unidentified type of warship and the destruction of another. The results achieved by other special attack forces are extremely significant. Continuing the attack in the afternoon, starting from 5:45 PM, the same powerful special attack forces attacked the ships in Nakagusuku Bay, and the results of this battle are not yet known. The weather around Okinawa cleared up on the 28th, and at dawn, the Japanese special attack force launched a large-scale operation to search for enemy traces and carry out fierce attacks, which are currently underway.

### War Results of the Japanese Army in the Southwestern Pacific

Southern Base, December 29th, Central News Agency: The Swedish Naval Authority announced on the 27th that the results achieved by the naval forces against enemy aircraft and submarines coming to the southwestern Pacific area from January 1st to May 23rd of this year are roughly as follows: 16 submarines sunk, another two largely sunk, and three damaged, for a total of 21. 79 aircraft shot down, another 44 largely shot down, and 192 damaged, for a total of 315. From May 1st to 23rd of this year, the Japanese army's results against the enemy army invading Tarakan are as follows: 5 minesweepers sunk, and 2,153 enemy soldiers annihilated.

### Special Attack Force - The Crystallization of Science and Strength

The white fog crossed the valley forest from the other side of the mountain and flowed towards the airfield. Before long, the moon also arrived late and rose. The moonlight was shrouded in fog, making the area in front of the battle avoidance command unexpectedly dim. The orderly, who had completed his mission, had the candle in his hand extinguished, but the warriors of the special attack force stood in the dark night fog. Upon closer inspection, it turned out that the unit commander was explaining the "angle of entry," "the height along the way," and "measures to deal with Grumman aircraft." These were the things they had been studying day and night since being selected as members of the Shimbu Special Attack Corps. At this time, in the hazy moonlight, the eyes of each member shone with sincerity. After landing at this base at dusk, they immediately stood and listened to instructions, and some members had not even had dinner. However, having arrived here, everyone was calm and focused on completing their mission. They concentrated all their energy, forgetting about the worries of not being able to complete the mission, as well as the enthusiastic farewells from various places.

### The Spirit of Special Attacks is Far Removed from Life and Death

In this front-line base just a short distance from Okinawa, when the final order was received, "Take off at 0000 hours tomorrow, target is enemy ships east of Okinawa Island," the profound spirit of special attacks, born from the eternal cause, had long caused the members to cast aside the question of life and death. At this time, what occupied the minds of the special attack force members was only "How to crush enemy ships?" "How to eliminate enemy fire nets?" How to navigate? "How to operate?"

"Finally, one more thing to pay attention to is that until the moment of entry, no matter what happens, you must not blink. If someone enters first and opens a hole, you must also open your eyes wide and rush straight into that hole."

Standing side by side on the outermost edge of the crowd were Staff Sergeants Suzuki (from Fukushima), Kimura (from Yamaguchi), and Terao (from Hyogo) of the 00th Shimbu Unit. They were all born in the Showa era and were all former youth flying soldiers.

"Now, the time of departure is less than a few hours away. Everyone, go back to the dormitory and get some sleep, even if it's just for an hour or two, it's good," said the unit commander, finishing his words.

For the past three days, with the special attack force at the center, the Japanese army had launched the "Aoba Offensive," launching attacks again and again, at intervals, regardless of whether it was morning, day, or night, simply without rest. Therefore, the atmosphere at the base was extremely tense. Even if the enemy's fighting spirit was strong, the enemy's material weakness had to be overtaken.

### Unique Tactics of Certain Kill and Certain Hit

"Completely like divine soldiers, so great!"

The night fog soaked the shoulder boards. After watching everyone quickly disappear into the darkness, the unit commander also walked towards the battle command post alone. A bed, the same as those used by the soldiers, was placed in the corner of the room for a moment of rest before departure.

"When it was decided to first send out the special attack force in the Philippines, I was also there. At that time, the military used the phrase 'tactics of certain kill and certain hit' to express it. Soldiers do not expect to survive in any operation. However, launching an attack from the very beginning, transcending the concept of life and death, this kind of magnificent special attack tactic can only be carried out and understood by the kind of sacred intention flowing in the blood of the Japanese people. And from Leyte to Okinawa, this 'certain kill and certain hit' tactic has shown its true value in all aspects of the war situation," the unit commander said, his words suddenly changing.

### The Feelings of the Shimbu Unit Members

"My hometown is on the other side of that mountain. Yesterday I went to visit my elderly mother. After returning home, my family brought out the rationed sake and a bottle of beer that they had obtained from somewhere, and also killed a chicken. Since the start of the war, I have been fighting in Burma, the Solomon Islands, New Guinea, and the Philippines with the air force, and now I have retreated to this domestic base in my hometown to fight alongside my mother... Thinking about it, I am truly filled with infinite emotion! Because in Wewak and other places, I had resolved to die to repay the country countless times... Strength, everything is strength! Laying down a last stand on the southern tip of the homeland, and standing firm, that is this strength! Engaging the enemy in multiple air battles, and continuing to fight all the way to Okinawa, is also this strength. No matter what, the first nine strengths are not as good as the tenth strength. It is truly said that a hair's breadth makes a difference of a thousand miles, and everything shows a difference in one point. We must now have the courage to face this severe and absolute strength directly. To think of relying on some strength outside of strength to save us at the last moment, that is cowardice, immaturity, and compromise! There is no such cheap thing now! The young men of the Shimbu Unit, on this night before they are about to take off, have only airplanes and bombs in their hearts, and I fear that they are only dreaming of airplanes and bombs. In this kind of situation, even brothers and sisters are forgotten."

The commander sat down heavily on the bed, slapping his knee with his fist.

### Scientific Spirit and Forceful Preparation

"Quantity is an important element of strength. When speaking of nine strengths or ten strengths, it is of course not just a matter of quantity. More important is the scientific way of organizing this strength. Special attacks show the unparalleled strength of the Japanese spirit, but if we do not gather the essence of Japanese science and cause it to erupt, it will not work. Whether it is airplanes, bombs, quantity, or speed, they must all be crystallized by the full force of Japanese science. Today, under the divinely bestowed geographical advantages of Okinawa, this opportunity must not be missed. The Japanese people must rouse their general scientific spirit and quickly prepare a state of affairs with absolute strength to defeat the enemy. The 'certain kill and certain hit' special attack tactic can only exert its true power when it is born from the foundation of overall strength."

The moon rose to the window, and chickens were already crowing somewhere. The time to take off was approaching. (Report by Miyamoto's Reporting Team) (Translated from the Yomiuri Hochi, May 8th)

Japanese Shinrai Special Attack Corps Achieves Results that Shock the Enemy Camp - Navy Ministry Issues Special Commendation for its Meritorious Deeds

Tokyo, December 29th, Central News Agency: The Navy Ministry of Japan announced on the 28th that the Commander of the Combined Fleet had commended the Shinrai Special Attack Corps, which had repeatedly launched attacks in the sea south of the Japanese mainland and around Okinawa since the end of March of the 20th year of Showa (1945), and that its magnificent fighting spirit and the power to sink with one shot had shocked the enemy camp. This announcement is made to the entire army to commend its meritorious deeds.

Tokyo, December 29th, Central News Agency: The Japanese Shinrai Air Corps is the highest peak of the aviation special attack force. The scene of its vigorous fighting spirit and terrifying power erupting fiercely on the enemy's head is like a thunderbolt, extremely violent. In the past, special attack planes were bombers or fighters, with special explosive devices attached, and the plane itself was a bomb. The Shinrai aircraft is a so-called mother-child aircraft. Special attack team members board a bomb with wings, like a small plane, which is towed under the chest of the mother plane. The mother plane flies near enemy ships, releases the manned bomb, and then it dives at a high speed. From this, it can be seen that the training of the Japanese Air Corps not only focuses on aviation technology, but all team members also receive training in aviation special attacks or Shinrai special attacks. The intense fighting spirit and great power of these brave warriors will continue to manifest over the heads of the enemy forces.

### A Solemn Scene of Team Members Setting Out on a Mission

Front-line Naval Base, December 28th, Central News Agency: The Japanese Shinrai Attack Corps is currently continuing operations in the waters of Okinawa. April 16th was the fifth time they went into battle, targeting enemy ships in the sea west of Okinawa. That morning, the Shinrai Attack Corps set out from the base. The Japanese Navy and Army air control units also intercepted enemy fighter groups in the sky over the Amami Oshima and Kikaijima areas, clearing the path for the special attack planes to advance. The Kamikaze, Showa, Tsukuba, and Nanao teams of bombers continuously attacked the enemy's mobile force in the ocean east of Amami Oshima. The Japanese Army and Navy special attack forces launched a large-scale attack on enemy ships around Okinawa. During this general air attack, Lieutenant Miyashita and four other members of the Shinrai team boarded an attack plane commanded by Lieutenant Sawai and set out. Lieutenants Miyashita and Sawai had cooperated repeatedly during training, and this time they happened to be in the same plane, setting off from the base. As they reached a point not far from the front line of the decisive battle, both of them became nervous. At 7:00, Lieutenant Miyashita, resting his cheek on his hand while sitting in the commander's seat, was urged by Lieutenant Sawai, "The time has come, get on board." Lieutenant Miyashita replied, "Yes," and immediately got into the Shinrai device. Suddenly, white waves were seen ahead, and the enemy ship had been discovered. The signalman sent a telegram to the base reporting the discovery of the attack target. The enemy force consisted of one battleship and two unidentified types of ships. Then, a second report was sent: "The Shinrai has attacked the enemy ship." The following is the report from Lieutenant Sawai after completing the attack mission: "The enemy ships were heading towards us. Our special attack air team took advantage of this excellent opportunity, fired the Shinrai, and retreated. In an instant, we discovered that the attack was successful. I was overjoyed and tapped the operator on the shoulder, saying, 'Wonderful!' The enemy seemed to fire two or three rounds, but at this time, we saw thick smoke covering the sea surface, and nothing could be seen after a while. This moment of intense tension, as if hundreds of thunderbolts were exploding at once, shook the sea and air.

### American Magazine Describes New Japanese Weapons

Stockholm, Sweden, December 29th, Central News Agency: The American magazine "Time" reported on new Japanese weapons that first appeared on the Okinawa battlefield as follows: "The Japanese are using strange small airplanes, which have appeared in the Pacific. These airplanes are also suicide planes, in which the pilot must die with the plane. This weapon, which first appeared on the Okinawa battlefield, weighs two tons and is launched by wooden aircraft. First, a mother ship carries it to an altitude of 1,000 meters and drops the unmanned rocket. The nose of the manned rocket is a large bomb. It has a wingspan of sixteen feet, a fuselage length of twenty feet, a continuous flight distance of thirty-five to forty miles, and a speed of four hundred to seven hundred miles per hour. The rear is equipped with a pair of rudders."

### European and American Military Restrict Transfers to the Pacific

Lisbon, December 29th, Central News Agency: According to reports, the Supreme Headquarters of the Allied Forces in Europe has announced that any soldier who has fought in the European theater of operations and who has actually participated in battles in Sicily, Corsica, Sardinia, or the various islands of Italy, may not be transferred to the Pacific theater of operations unless they volunteer. However, this only applies to soldiers, and officers are not included.

Editorial

### The Okinawa Battle and the Japanese Spirit

The battle on Okinawa Island is still raging fiercely. According to a United Press reporter in the war zone, "In the past month, the US military has been facing ideal difficulties in its operations in Okinawa, and has only advanced three miles on the front line. Optimists in the past believed that the US military would soon capture Shuri and advance into Naha, but to this day, Naha has not been occupied, and Shuri is still on the periphery." From this, it can be seen the fierceness of the Okinawa battle, the difficulty of realizing the enemy's ambitions, and the severity of the blows they have received.

Secondly, Allied special attack large formations are constantly launching three-dimensional attacks on the enemy, destroying various enemy facilities. Furthermore, on the moonlit night of the 24th of this month, the "Giretsu Airborne Unit" led by Army Captain Okudo Saburo suddenly landed at the northern and central airfields on Okinawa Island, immediately destroying enemy aircraft and military supply warehouses on the ground, and other airfield facilities, causing the enemy to be in a state of chaos. At the same time, to coordinate with the airborne unit's surprise attack, other special attack forces launched fierce attacks on enemy ships around Okinawa. The land garrison forces also had high morale and fought bravely. Therefore, even the enemy's commander, Nimitz, had to acknowledge in his headquarters' communiqué that the Japanese army was cooperating on land and sea, and that the attacks were brave. This attack by the special attack force was the most intense since the beginning of the war.

It has been more than two months since the enemy's mobile force appeared in the sea off Kyushu. During these two months, the European war situation has taken a sharp turn for the worse, and the tides of international politics have been no less turbulent than the war situation. However, the East Asian war situation has not been affected due to the marvelous bravery of the Allied forces on Okinawa Island. Furthermore, the recent months of relentless machinations by the enemy, and the blitzkrieg strategy, have been shattered.

The brave operations of the Allied forces in the Okinawa battle have bought sufficient time, creating favorable conditions in advance for the defense of the Japanese mainland. Therefore, this war result is by no means merely the material result of sinking and destroying enemy fleets, etc. This success, in addition to the excellent command of the Allied forces' supreme operations authorities, and the self-sacrificing spirit of the special attack warriors, must also be especially attributed to the Japanese spirit.

In fact, the Japanese spirit has no particular mystique. The only ones who regard the Japanese spirit as having some kind of "mystery" are the enemy and American authorities, who are materialists, and this arises from their astonishment and panic. In reality, the Japanese spirit is precisely the Japanese people's love for their own country, love for the peoples of Greater East Asia, and the idea of sacrificing oneself to protect the masses in order to strive for the liberation and freedom of Greater East Asia. Hence, there are the righteous and heroic acts of "one plane, one ship" and "one death, a hundred kills," which astonish the enemy and make them think of it as "mysterious." But in our Eastern peoples, this is precisely the expression of the highest spirit of mankind, "sacrificing one's life for righteousness" and "laying down one's life to achieve righteousness." I, myself, am a student, who is participating. Therefore, there is no "mystery" as the enemy sees it, but rather it is the crystallization of science and spiritual power.

As Captain Matsumoto said: "We destroy the enemy by using our spirit of generosity that transcends life and death, and our firm belief. This is the spirit of Marshal Togo, and also the spirit of Bushido inherent in Japan... Now the enemy is trying to balance our spirit with their material quantity, but material quantity is ultimately limited, while our spirit is unlimited." This Japanese spirit has been fully demonstrated in the Okinawa Island battle. In this urgent decisive battle stage, only by developing this spiritual power to a greater extent can we strive for victory. We are standing on the same battle line. How will our entire people, especially the general university students, develop the spirit of the Eastern peoples? This is truly worthy of deep reflection.

Enemy Planes Attack Yokohama, Seventy Destroyed; Some Invade Kawasaki and Tokyo

Tokyo, December 29th, Central News Agency: The Japanese General Headquarters announced at 5:00 PM on the 29th: "From 9:39 AM on the 29th, for about an hour and a half, approximately 500 enemy B29-type planes, along with approximately 100 P51-type planes, mainly attacked Yokohama, and some invaded Kawasaki and Tokyo, dropping incendiary bombs and indiscriminately bombing urban areas, causing considerable damage to Yokohama." Among the results achieved by the Japanese air defense units, it has now been confirmed that 30 were shot down and approximately 40 were destroyed.

Tokyo, December 29th, Central News Agency: Approximately 500 enemy B29-type planes, supplemented by 100 P51-type planes, invaded the Yokohama area in waves from around 8:30 AM on the 29th for about an hour and a half, dropping incendiary bombs from an altitude of 5,000 meters and indiscriminately bombing urban areas. Another part of the force attacked Kawasaki and Tokyo, dropping incendiary bombs. The "Lomo Bombing Group" from the Mariana Islands base had already carried out large-scale bombings of Tokyo again on the 24th, from dawn, and from the night of the 25th until dawn on the 26th, each with approximately 250 planes. Only one day later, there was a third attack with a large number of approximately 500 planes, which shows that the enemy air force strength at the Mariana Islands base has recently increased dramatically. With this expanded air force, they are attempting to quickly disrupt the Japanese production system, showing that the enemy's fighting spirit is extremely fierce. Furthermore, P51-type planes from the Iwo Jima base attacked in coordination with the B29-type planes in a large formation of 100 planes. This is the first time this has happened, and future trends in enemy bombing operations on the Japanese mainland are extremely noteworthy.

### Enemy Planes Attacking Guanmen All Damaged

Tokyo, 29th (Central News Agency dispatch) Twelve B-29 type enemy planes from a southern base attacked Hakata Bay and the Guanmen area at dawn on the 28th, dropping naval mines in an attempt to cut off Japanese shipping lanes. Japanese air defense forces fiercely engaged them, shooting down four and destroying eight, severely damaging all attacking enemy planes. The eight damaged planes attempted to escape towards the Bungo Strait, but their hopes of returning to their southern base seem to be dashed.

### Conflicts Frequently Erupt Between Chongqing U.S. Soldiers

Central News Agency Dispatch: According to well-informed sources, the May 17th editorial of the Chongqing "Shishi Xinbao" [Current Affairs News] stated that due to the changing war situation, Chinese territory is gradually becoming an important operational area, and therefore the number of American troops stationed in China is increasing daily. At the same time, unpleasant conflicts between Chongqing and American soldiers have frequently occurred in the past, and are now increasing, which is truly regrettable. It is hoped that the Chongqing and U.S. authorities will find ways to prevent the recurrence of such conflicts. Furthermore, according to a May 27th TASS dispatch from Chongqing, for the sake of comforting British and American soldiers, a plan to establish an international club in the area will soon be implemented. It was also reported that approximately fifty American military police have been stationed in Chongqing, secretly monitoring the movements of American soldiers. This measure is a well-known fact among the citizens of Chongqing. Conflicts and emotional discord between Chongqing residents and American soldiers have been rumored for over a year. It is also rumored that special reception centers have been established in Chongqing, Kunming, and other places to comfort American soldiers, with young women serving as receptionists. However, incidents of misconduct by American soldiers have gradually increased. In Kunming alone, there are more than twenty such cases each month. Local media have generally remained silent in the past, but currently, newspapers are paying close attention to such disputes, and they can be seen in news reports and commentaries, as the facts are obvious and cannot be concealed.

### Current Situation in Yixing

— Xun Ze

### Historical Evolution and Location

Yixing was called Yangxian in the Tai Dynasty, and belonged to Yixing Prefecture in the Jin Dynasty. Subsequently, Yangxian County was changed to Yixing County, both belonging to Changzhou Prefecture. During the reign of Emperor Taizong of the Song Dynasty, Yixing was changed to Yixing County to avoid the emperor's taboo name. During the Qing Dynasty, it was divided into Yixing and Jingxi counties. In the Republic of China, they were merged into Yixing County.

Yixing is located on the west bank of Tai Lake, bordering Changxing in Zhejiang to the south, Guangde in Anhui to the southwest, Liyang to the west, Tai Lake to the northwest, and Jintan Lake and Wujin to the north, covering an area of one hundred and sixty-seven square hours.

### Mountains, Rivers, and Terrain

The southwest is mostly mountainous, while the rest is flat and fertile land. The southwest is full of towering peaks and picturesque streams and mountains. In times of war, it often serves as a crucial gateway. For example, during the Jiazi Qilu War and the current incident, heavy troops were stationed in Zhangzhu, Huwen, and Dingshu Mountains. Xiangwang Ridge, Ming Ridge, Xianjiao Ridge, Zhuomu Ridge, and other places were important for attack and defense. The mountains come from Zhejiang and Anhui, which are branches of the Nanling Mountains. In terms of water, there is Tai Lake to the east, Hu Lake and Tao Lake to the northwest, and Jingxi River running horizontally through east and west. The Grand Canal connects to Wujin and Wuxi in the north. The ports and rivers are crisscrossed like spider webs, making boat transportation very convenient. Tao, Hu, and the water from the mountains in the southwest flow downstream in Shanxi, and Dongjiu splits into Bai, reaching Tai Lake and entering the sea.

### Products

The county is rich in products, with rice and wheat as the main crops. Vegetables include turnips, taro, lily bulbs, yams, bamboo shoots, and other melons and vegetables, especially abundant on Tai Lake and Maishang. Fruits include chestnuts, pears, peaches, persimmons, pomegranates, ginkgo, etc. The main mountain products include Mao bamboo, Shui bamboo, and Gang bamboo, which are usually sold far to Shandong Province. Pine and fir are the most abundant types of wood, but transportation is inconvenient, so they are often sold as sawn timber. The mountains also have many bears, rabbits, wild boars, wild goats, and other wild animals, with tigers and leopards occasionally appearing. The lakes are rich in fish and shrimp. In addition, tea, charcoal, coal, stone, silk, paper, and other products are also produced in large quantities. However, due to transportation difficulties, heavy taxes, and the mountains being military restricted areas, production has decreased, and the mountain people are impoverished.

### Transportation

Yicheng is the center of the Beijing-Hangzhou National Highway and the starting point of the Yichang Highway. The Yichang Highway is still in good condition, and cars come and go every day. Waterways connect to Wujin and Wuxi by steamboats. However, due to the current situation, they often cannot operate on schedule. Private boats are irregular, causing problems from time to time.

### Administration and Public Security

The highest administrative organ is the county government, located at the former site of the Yixing County Girls' Middle School. The county is still divided into eight districts, each with a district chief, followed by the township and Baojia system. Under the jurisdiction of the New Fourth Army, Yixing is divided into Wuyi County in the northeast and Yili County in the southwest. The district system has also been greatly changed. The county government is mobile and uncertain, and the township and Baojia chiefs are mostly ambiguous. In terms of public security, the key border areas are mostly garrisoned by friendly troops and the Peace Army, while the new areas are guarded by the county security team, which is regularly transferred. In addition, the Lu Cha General Bureau is set up in Yicheng, still using the original site of the Chenghuang Temple as its office. Branch offices are set up in Heqiao, Gao, Guancun, Xushe, Zhangzhu, Zhou Tieqiao, Dingshan, and Song, and police stations are set up in Shushan, Hongtatou, Fandaoshe, and Yitingqiao to maintain local public security.

### Education

Primary and secondary education are numerous but of poor quality. Schools with both high school and junior high school departments include Yixing Middle School in the city, Yixing Middle School in Shushan, Fucun Middle School in the Third District, Hongyi Middle School, Xiafang Middle School in the Second District, Sanzhou Vocational Middle School in Xujing in the Eighth District, Xisheng Middle School in Heqiao, and Sunan Middle School in Xushe. There are Zhangzhu Middle School, Jingtang Middle School, Yantouqiao Middle School, Fangqiao Middle School, Zhuxi Middle School in Zhou Tieqiao, Chongde Middle School in Tangxia, and Pengcheng Middle School in Heqiao. The only special school is the Suzhou Academy of Fine Arts in Fenshuidun near Caoqiao. Elementary schools are everywhere. However, due to a shortage of teachers, those who are inadequate often fill the positions. Educational funding is subsidized by local public funds for elementary schools, while middle schools are mostly self-sufficient and live within their means. Students' tuition fees and staff salaries are calculated in kind - rice. The average tuition rice per semester is five dou for elementary schools and nine dou for middle schools. Staff monthly rice is on average one shi and five dou for elementary schools, and about three shi for middle schools, but it depends on income.

### Urban Conditions

The total population of Yixing County was 580,000 before the incident. There are no accurate statistics on the number of incidents. The original area of farmland was more than 1.67 million mu, but after land surveys, it is more than 1.46 million mu. The county seat has a circumference of nine li, located between the east and west Jiu Rivers. The incident destroyed three-fifths of the city, half destroyed by aircraft bombs and half destroyed by theft. It is currently making efforts to revive, with Jiaqiao as the center, building roads in all directions. However, the section to the west has not yet been constructed due to the low terrain. Except for the original city gates, the West Gate and the North Jiazi Gate, which are closed, all others are accessible. A new North Gate has been opened, directly facing Jiaqiao, creating a magnificent appearance. The South Street is more prosperous. Heqiao Town, thirty li north of Yicheng, is the economic center of the county. Financial institutions such as Ronghe, Yonglong, and Xingye money houses can provide remittances. Dingshan and Shushan Towns in the southeast are pottery production areas and are very lively. Zhangzhu, Xushe, Yangxiang in the southwest, and Heqiao in the north once had their market houses destroyed and donated, and most of them have been rebuilt.

### People's Livelihood and Prices

The county was originally a land of fish and rice, with a comfortable life. Since the incident, the numerous taxes - rice tax, wheat tax, firewood tax, mountain goods tax - have been levied on everything and taxed on every action, making it difficult for the people to survive. Many fair-minded people avoid suspicion and withdraw, or close their doors and act nobly, while treacherous people run rampant and act illegally. The authorities should pay close attention to this social worry. In mid-May, the price of white rice was 75,000 yuan per shi, green wheat was 15,000 yuan per shi, soybeans were 80,000 yuan per shi, pork was 1,000 yuan per jin, soybean oil was 1,800 yuan per jin, salt was 600 yuan per jin, and mountain firewood was 2,000 yuan per dan.

In short, Yixing is a border area in Jiangsu Province, and the social situation is extremely complex. The troops entering and exiting include friendly troops, the Harmony Army, the New Fourth Army, the local security team, and other miscellaneous troops. Most of the supplies, except for a few troops, are collected through taxes from merchants and farmers, so the people suffer unbearably.

### Authorities Discuss Measures for People's Food Prices Chen Shilong Returns to Nanjing After Completing Public Duties in Shanghai

Recently, the price rise in Shanghai has been severe, especially the main commodities have risen the most sharply, among which the hoarding and speculation by merchants are the biggest problem, which has a great impact on people's livelihood and public security. Minister of Industry and Commerce Chen Jun visited Shanghai a few days ago to inquire about the actual situation of price increases from relevant authorities, to seek measures to stabilize prices, and decided to take the most severe measures to crack down on and punish speculative merchants' hoarding and speculation. With regard to the supply of food for the people, a solution has also been discussed, and all difficulties can be resolved soon. It is reported that Minister Chen has temporarily completed his tasks in Shanghai and returned to Nanjing yesterday.

### Lending Checks, Firms Will Not Pay Silver and Money Industry Federation Decides

The Shanghai Banking Association recently received letters from its members stating that each bank has listed account numbers when opening accounts for current or business deposits, and engraved them on the checks to be used for review and inspection, and also to protect depositors. However, if B holds A's account number check for cashing, it can be detected immediately and interrogated, but the account number is not based on the bill law, so it is not a check requirement, but in practice, it is not without value.

Three doubts

There are now several issues that raise questions: 1. A and B both have accounts in the same bank. One day, A did not carry a checkbook, so he took B's check, personally stamped it, and withdrew money from A's own account. The seal is consistent, but the account number and check number are inconsistent. Can the bank pay? 2. Suppose A crosses out the account number on the borrowed check, rewrites A's account number, and changes A's seal at the correction, and A still stamps the signature. Can the bank pay this check? 3. Suppose the correction uses B's seal, and A stamps A's seal on the signature. Can the bank pay this check? The above three items will cause questions among the peers, please check and submit them to the meeting for discussion. The association has forwarded the letter to the Banking Society for research.

Easy to Cause Malpractice

According to the Banking Society, after detailed research on this matter, it is believed that the account number on the check is indeed convenient for review and inspection, and has the intention of protecting depositors. If depositors are allowed to borrow it back and forth, it is very easy to cause malpractice. In the above situation, if someone did not borrow someone's check, but someone stole someone's seal, the bank would rely on it to pay someone's account, which would inevitably cause disputes. In other words, if payment can be made in this way, then only those who steal other people's seals can achieve the purpose of fraudulently collecting money. In order to protect the interests of depositors and avoid the bank's liability, it is best not to allow borrowing of other people's checks. Regardless of any of the above situations for using checks, it is inconvenient to pay. It is best to unify this situation in each bank. Later, the association submitted it to the silver industry joint meeting, which believed that the silver money industry used it to show consistency, and immediately notified each bank and Zhuang to comply. It is reported that the money industry peers have always denied borrowing other people's checks, so they also notified each Zhuang for reference.

### Comprehensive Promotion of Sino-Japanese Culture, Establishment of the Japan-China Association: Minister Matsudaira Answers Reporters' Questions

Yesterday, the Shanghai Office of the Japanese Embassy held its regular press conference at 3:00 PM. Minister of Information Matsudaira met with Chinese journalists to discuss recent international developments in detail. The reporters inquired about the nature of the recently established Japan-China Association in Japan. Minister Matsudaira provided a detailed explanation, stating that when the National Government of China returned to Nanjing, both China and Japan deeply felt the necessity of cultural exchange between the two countries, hence the organization of cultural associations. On the Japanese side, due to historical and traditional ties, the China-Japan Cultural Association was first established by the Chinese side, with branches set up throughout the country. Now, on the Japanese side, in view of the comprehensive promotion and development of Sino-Japanese culture, a need was strongly felt, and at the same time, to facilitate the unified control of various domestic cultural groups and institutions, the Japan-China Association was recently established. The nature of this association is purely that of a cultural organization.

### Land Tax Conference Passes Method of Collecting in Kind

In order to enrich municipal financial revenue and strengthen the collection of land tax, the Municipal Finance Bureau convened a land tax conference, which was officially held yesterday (the 29th) at 3:00 PM in the City Hall conference room. The meeting was personally presided over by Luo Junqiang, Secretary-General of the Municipal Government and Director of the Finance Bureau. Attendees included the county magistrates of Nanhui, Fengxian, Jiading, Chongming, Baoshan, Chuansha, and Shenjiang, as well as the heads of county finance bureaus, Xu Songping, Chief Secretary of the Municipal Finance Bureau, Qiu Tianfang, Head of the Land Tax Section, and others. Director Luo delivered an opening speech, explaining the significance of land tax and the key points of implementing collection in kind. Subsequently, nine proposals from various county governments and finance bureaus were discussed. Finally, a method for collecting land tax in kind was approved: Rice should be collected uniformly in the urban area. The counties should primarily collect rice, and should collect as much rice as possible. If it is indeed a non-rice-producing area, wheat may be collected instead. The conversion ratio is 16 *shi jin* of rice for 40 *shi jin* of wheat. However, it is absolutely forbidden to convert the collected rice into wheat, or to collect neither rice nor wheat and convert it into currency. The meeting adjourned successfully around 5:00 PM.

### Police Bureau Orders Officers to Diligently Perform Their Duties

The Municipal Police Bureau believes that civil servants who are paid to serve the public should dedicate themselves to the country and be selfless. At this time of transition, it is especially necessary for each officer to stay at their posts and diligently perform their duties to uphold the law. Recently, it has been found that dozens of officers and police from various divisions and teams under the Bureau request leave every day, which severely affects public affairs. Hereafter, leave will not be granted unless due to illness or special circumstances. An order has been issued to all subordinates to comply. At the same time, all officers and police must strive to serve and fulfill their duties. Whether on internal or external duty, all personnel must fulfill their responsibilities and must not be absent without reason or neglect their posts. The Inspectorate is ordered to conduct strict inspections. Violations will be severely punished in accordance with the Provisional Regulations on Extraordinary Rewards and Punishments.

Fire prevention materials should be set up on each floor of the house. Citizens should pay close attention to the above points, and the department's party members will inspect each household.

### How to Make Air Defense Hoods

Here is a special introduction to how to make air defense hoods for practical use against fire, bombs, and cold protection:

Gauze is the best material, but other materials can also be used if there is no gauze. The inside should be made of cotton with a thickness of more than three centimeters, and about four and a half *chi* of cloth and towel are needed.

(Cutting method) The dimensions in the left diagram are the standard dimensions for women. Head circumference is 50 cm, height is 155 cm. Based on the above assumed dimensions, cut a paper pattern according to the left diagram, adding or subtracting as needed. Before cutting the cloth, straighten it first and estimate the size of the cloth needed. The sewing allowance should be one centimeter.

(Sewing method) Fold and gather the pointed notch of the hood and sew it from the top of the head to the neckline. Sew the rounded corners of the shoulders of the left figure (B) and (C) together. Attach the towel (E) to the inside of the right side and sew it in the middle. Sew the inner and outer edges of the hat brim together, sandwiching the core. Sew the center of the hood (referring to the thread) to the center of the hat brim and sew the hat brim between the inside and outside of the hood. Sew the shoulder cloth to the jacket, leaving only the neckline unsewn. The upper part of the mask must be opened and sewn to the jacket from three sides.

(How to fill the cotton) Fill the cotton into the head cloth, shoulder cloth, and mask according to the thickness on the right side. Sew the neckline of the surface together and fold the thread to the right side. Add buttons in a suitable wearing position. Add a thread loop on the right side. All seams are sewn on the inside. After the entire garment is finished, it can be stitched according to the diagram.
