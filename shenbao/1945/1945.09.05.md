Key Points of the Speech

Japan was the first country to launch aggression, and Japan's unconditional surrender marks the final failure of aggressor nations. China was the first country to be invaded and the one that resisted aggression for the longest time. After eight years of arduous struggle and cruel sacrifice, we persevered and fulfilled our duty as a member of the United Nations. Although Japan's fate of failure was predetermined, the Japanese were a stubborn enemy, and the war could have been prolonged. This early victory, shortening the war and reducing human sacrifice, is thanks to the united efforts of the Allied nations, the collaborative efforts of the United States, Britain, the Soviet Union, and France in resolving the European war, which enabled a swift transfer of forces to the Pacific. We are especially grateful to the Soviet Union for resolutely joining the war, accelerating the collapse of the Japanese invaders. In particular, we are grateful and will never forget the righteous actions of the United States, which fulfilled its great mission as the arsenal of the United Nations, contributing in military, economic, and scientific terms to achieve Japan's unconditional surrender today. China's seaports have been blockaded for many years, and the military and civilians have been struggling under extremely difficult conditions. We are especially grateful to the Allied envoys, Allied generals, particularly General Wedemeyer, Commander of US Forces in China, who shared life and death with us in the China theater, united and unwavering. This is something that the Supreme Commander of the China Theater and all officers and soldiers particularly appreciate and are grateful for. Today, we celebrate our joint victory with the utmost joy, but the main task remains how we, the United Nations, will continue to work to lay the foundation for lasting world peace after achieving today's victory. China will certainly strive for lasting world peace with the spirit of resistance. Long live the joint victory of the United Nations.

### Director Zhang and His Entourage Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday Morning; Advance Command Post Established

According to a Central News Agency report, Shanghai citizens, longing for the National Army for eight years, will be airlifted to Shanghai within days. The National Army ordered to be stationed in the Nanjing-Shanghai area this time is the Third Front Army of the Army Headquarters, led by Tang Enbo. Deputy Commander Zhang Xuezhong, Zheng Dongguo, and Chief of Staff Xu Zuyi, along with an entourage of over forty people, arrived in Shanghai by plane yesterday morning and established the Third Front Army Advance Command Post on the seventh floor of the Cathay Hotel on the Bund, and began preliminary takeover preparations. The details are as follows:

Over Forty People Arrived in Shanghai by Plane

The Third Front Army Advance Command Post is presided over by Deputy Commander Zhang Xuezhong. Zhang, along with Deputy Commander Zheng Dongguo, Chief of Staff Xu Zuyi (currently the Dean of the Research Institute of the Army University), Deputy Chief of Staff Li Yuankai, Chief Secretary Hu Jingru, Chief of Staff He Yiming of the Third District Garrison Command, and staff secretary Zhong Xiangzhen, a total of twenty-four people, and Major Dibas, the Chief of Staff of the US Liaison Command, and engineering personnel, a total of over forty people, flew from Liuzhou on seven C54 transport planes at 3 AM yesterday morning and landed at Dachang Airport at around 8 AM. Over a hundred people, including Commander Zhang Jie of the Second Air Force District and people from all walks of life, welcomed them at the airport. On the Japanese side, Lieutenant General Matsui, commander of the 13th Army stationed in Shanghai (i.e., the troops), sent Deputy Chief of Staff Major General Kawamoto, Senior Staff Officer Colonel Sasai, and Staff Officer Lieutenant Colonel Ichikawa. On the naval side, Colonel Kuwahara was sent. On the air force side, Major Nakamura, commander of the 43rd Aviation Brigade, arrived at the airport in advance to welcome them. When Deputy Commander Zhang and others disembarked, the Japanese officers stood at attention and saluted. They then took nine cars to rest on the seventh floor of the Cathay Hotel on the Bund. At 10:30 AM, Mayor Wu Xun and Secretary-General Huang Boqiao of the representative office visited Director Zhang and Deputy Commander Zheng and immediately held a military meeting to discuss the steps for the military takeover of Shanghai and the general situation. The meeting concluded at 12 PM.

Zhang Gave a Written Statement

Director Zhang issued a written statement to the Central News Agency reporter saying: "Our Front Army was ordered to go to the Nanjing-Shanghai area to accept the unconditional surrender of the Japanese army. I led the advance command post to Shanghai first to make all necessary preparations. When the plane landed, we saw the flag of the Blue Sky and White Sun flying over the city again, which was truly exciting.

Recalling the "August 13th" Battle of Shanghai, we strongly resisted the enemy's offensive in Shanghai for three months. This earth-shattering and awe-inspiring feat was due to the brave efforts of our troops. The people of Shanghai warmly assisted in the war of resistance, contributing money and efforts, shedding blood and sweat, and enduring all kinds of suffering and sacrifice, which inspired morale, shifted international perceptions, and promoted the national fighting spirit. It is the beautiful foundation for today's victory.

Now that we have won victory, Shanghai today is no longer the Shanghai of the past. The national humiliation accumulated and manifested in Shanghai over the past fifty years has been washed away by the blood and sweat of the military and civilians over eight years. In the future, Shanghai will continue to make its greatest efforts to build the country and protect peace with the glorious history of the war of resistance. The citizens of Shanghai will also set an example for the country and lay the foundation with the demeanor of great citizens."

About Two Thousand Vanguard Troops

According to Chief Secretary Hu Jingru of the command, the reporter from the Central News Agency said: "The Third Front Army was ordered to fight in the Guizhou-Guangxi area, and after capturing Liuzhou and Guilin, most of the troops gathered in Liuzhou. Therefore, the Third Front Army stationed in Shanghai this time will all fly from Liuzhou. The vanguard troops will arrive within days. It is estimated that there will be more than two thousand troops arriving by air. Because the barracks are not fully prepared, the National Army coming to Shanghai will temporarily stay in the aircraft sheds at Dachang Airport and will not immediately enter the urban area. The task of our advance command post to come to Shanghai first is to collect materials such as surface registers of the Japanese defense area to make preliminary preparations for the takeover. General Tang Enbo will fly from the accompanying capital to Shanghai after most of the National Army has arrived by air." Several dozen US engineering personnel flew to Shanghai on five transport planes yesterday morning.

### Summoning Japanese Authorities for Instructions on Preparations for Takeover

Central News Agency: Lieutenant General Zhang Xuezhong, Deputy Commander of the Third War Area and Director of the Forward Command Post, summoned the Japanese military representatives responsible for the Shanghai area at the Cathay Hotel at 6:00 PM last night to hold the first takeover meeting. The meeting place was set in the dining room on the eighth floor of the Cathay Hotel, with a portrait of the late Premier Sun Yat-sen and the national flag of the Kuomintang. A long, round table was placed in the center of the room with three seats at the head, occupied by Lieutenant General Zhang Xuezhong in the center, Lieutenant General Zheng Dongguo on the left, and Colonel Dibas, Chief of Staff of the U.S. Liaison Command, on the right. Two seats were placed laterally, with Lieutenant General Xu Zuyi, Chief of Staff, on the left and Lieutenant General Li Yuankai, Deputy Chief of Staff, on the right. Five seats were placed below for the five Japanese officers attending. At 6:10 PM, the Japanese representatives entered in single file, bowed to General Zhang and others, and took their seats. First, Lieutenant General Doi Akio, Chief of Staff of the Thirteenth Army, who was in charge of the Japanese side's participation in the meeting, introduced the duties and names of the attending representatives: Major General Kawamoto, Deputy Chief of Staff; Colonel Sasai, Senior Staff Officer; and Lieutenant Colonel Ichii, Staff Officer (the last two seats were for the Japanese translators). After Doi Akio finished his introductions, Deputy Commander Zhang also introduced the duties and names of the attending representatives one by one.

Formal Meeting Proceedings

The formal meeting then began immediately. Director Zhang spoke first, stating, "I represent General Tang Enbo, Commander of the Third War Area, and am acting in accordance with the orders of General He Yingqin, Commander-in-Chief of the Chinese Army, to accept the surrender of the Japanese army in the Nanjing-Shanghai area. A forward command post has been established in Shanghai, presided over by myself. I am now sending you a telegram with the code 'Zhong Zi No. 4'. I hope you will examine it and forward it to your superior officer." Doi Akio nodded in agreement, and Director Zhang continued to ask, "Are you the plenipotentiary representative of General Matsui? Please present your certificate of authorization for review." Doi replied, "This is not a formal surrender signing meeting, so I did not bring the certificate. However, according to Japanese custom, the Chief of Staff can represent the Commander. If it is necessary at this meeting, it can be done immediately." Director Zhang requested that the certificate be submitted after the meeting, and at the same time handed the telegram to Doi Akio and asked him to sign and stamp it. However, Doi Akio stated that due to the wartime situation, seals were not usually used, so he would use a signature to prove that he had received the telegram. Director Zhang then asked the Japanese side, "Have all the memoranda and report forms that the General Headquarters of the Chinese Army has successively submitted to General Okamura been prepared, as well as the documents that have been ordered to be prepared, and which fall within the scope of your army?" Doi Akio replied, "Everything is ready." Zhang then said, "This should include the deployment of forces in Shanghai, naval and air force equipment and materials, and various military-managed enterprises, warehouses, food, and public property. Please hand over the forms." Doi replied, "I didn't bring them today. All the documents have been prepared and will be delivered to your office at 8:00 AM tomorrow (Tokyo time 9:00 AM)." Zhang then told the Japanese representatives, "You will be informed in writing or verbally about the handover of defense and various takeover methods. Please wait for further notice." After Doi acknowledged this, Zhang ordered the Japanese side, "Before our army takes over, the Japanese side shall be fully responsible for maintaining the security and order of all areas in Shanghai and its suburbs, as well as public utilities such as water, electricity, telephone, tram, and public buses." Doi replied, "Regarding public utilities, such as trains, water, and electricity, the amount of coal used is very large. Originally, this coal was transported from North China, but at present, the Japanese forces are insufficient. There is no certainty about this and the lack of coal will make it very difficult to maintain. Moreover, accidents often occur among railway workers. The Japanese side is doing its best to maintain various public utilities and trains, but the most serious problems are coal and workers. The Japanese side has reported this matter to your Nanjing Army Headquarters and has also asked Mr. Jiang Bocheng and Mr. Wu Shaoquan to jointly issue a bulletin ordering the workers to work with peace of mind. As for maintaining the security of Shanghai, the Japanese side has done its best. Now we only hope that your national army will come to Shanghai as soon as possible, so that the Japanese side can hand over the responsibility of guarding Shanghai as soon as possible and restore the peace and order of Shanghai as soon as possible." The meeting ended at 6:45 PM.

### Kuomintang's Letter to All Compatriots (3): Hoping for Unity of Purpose to Accomplish the Great Task of National Reconstruction

Mutual Trust and Confidence Will Ensure the Success of National Reconstruction

Although the War of Resistance has been won, the task is not yet complete. What urgently needs to be done together at present is demobilization, and what must be fully implemented soon is constitutional government. There are many important things to do. Regarding the former, we must arrange employment opportunities for soldiers, obtain necessary relief for families of those who fought in the war, plan for the reconstruction of cities and villages destroyed by artillery fire, seek to restore the businesses of overseas Chinese, solve the difficulties of young people in seeking education, and open up avenues for the development of industry, mining, agriculture, and commerce. Regarding the latter, we must accelerate the completion of local self-government, earnestly guarantee the rights of the people, establish people's representative bodies at all levels as soon as possible, and fully cultivate respect for the rule of law. For all these things, we must rely on our compatriots to apply the valuable lessons learned during the War of Resistance, consistently to the final stage of national reconstruction: that is, to resolve wartime problems by setting aside minor differences and eliminating personal prejudices, and to open up the road to construction by respecting unity and avoiding division in national reconstruction. Just as the War of Resistance gained assistance from others through self-help, national reconstruction should also seek international assistance by each doing their best. I sincerely hope that my compatriots will remember the previous lessons and work together to achieve complete success. Compatriots! The great war to resist aggression and save the nation has been won. A prosperous and happy country, a free and peaceful world, are shining before our eyes, but they cannot be realized without arduous efforts and joint progress.

Our party has always earnestly hoped to return the government to all compatriots, that is, to have all compatriots jointly shoulder the great task of national reconstruction and accomplish the great cause of national reconstruction, and to realize Dr. Sun Yat-sen's teachings that "sovereignty belongs to all the people" and "construction must begin with the people" in one fell swoop. If our compatriots can avoid complacency and laziness, seize the opportunity to jointly shoulder great responsibilities, our party will certainly be able to share joys and sorrows with our compatriots and jointly build a Republic of China where ethnic groups are equal, civil rights are unimpeded, and people live in happiness and prosperity. Our party trusts that our compatriots will surely be able to ensure the success of national reconstruction from today onwards, just as it trusts that our compatriots were able to ensure the victory of the War of Resistance before today. Our compatriots can trust that the promises of our party today and in the future will surely be fulfilled, just as they have proven that the promises of our party before today have already been fulfilled. Dr. Sun Yat-sen said, "The foundation of national reconstruction should begin in the mind." The interweaving of this kind of mutual trust and confidence between our party and all compatriots is the main force that has won the War of Resistance today and is the guarantee for the success of national reconstruction in the future. May all fathers, elders, and brothers in the country take note. (To be continued)

### Military Liaison Office Strictly Rectifies Military Discipline to Prevent Speculators from Disrupting Public Security

The Shanghai Temporary Military Liaison Office is the highest institution currently responsible for public security in the city. It has been extremely busy these days preparing for official business. Tasks such as correcting the actions of various troops stationed in Shanghai, maintaining public order in the city, and arresting those who disrupt public security are all underway, so that the residents can live in peace and be able to earn a living. Recently, given the large number of military institutions and troops stationed in Shanghai, it is difficult to guarantee that speculators will not take the opportunity to act. In addition to notifying various institutions and troops to register by a certain date, starting today, several special commissioners and staff members will be dispatched to the registered troops to conduct a detailed investigation of their content. Those who have unclear origins or are not needed to be stationed in Shanghai will be adjusted accordingly in order to maintain military discipline.

(Another report) Recently, there have often been unscrupulous people who falsely claim to be from the Zhongjiu Army and use the name of the Youth Corps to swagger around or arrest criminals, or seize supplies without authorization, violating laws and regulations, which is extremely hateful. The Military Liaison Office has informed all the military police teams and the current police bureau to conduct close investigations at any time. It is reported that the Qingnian Tuan (Youth Corp) will no longer issue badges from today onwards, except for gatherings, in order to prevent counterfeiting. When performing tasks externally, they must rely on official letters. In regard to the Zhongjiu Army, soldiers have been strictly ordered to abide by military discipline. In the future, if any of the above-mentioned misconducts occur again, citizens are allowed to report the facts to the liaison office at any time, or report to the military police team nearby for immediate execution.

### Pacific Hurricane to Pass Over Shanghai

It will probably pass over the sea east of Shanghai. However, the wind force is not strong and the city will not be harmed, but it will not be without obstacles to aviation and shipping.

### Guo Luzhou's Troops of the Zhongjiu Army to be Stationed in the City Soon

### Catching Up

— Cheng

Today's newspaper published two articles, one by Mr. Bing Ding entitled "Already Existed in Ancient Times vs. Now Exists," and the other by Mr. Xing Zhiren entitled "Remembering Mr. Zhou Xufu." The latter article describes Mr. Zhou's great achievements in atomic research, for which he won two international awards this year.

The former article points out the Chinese people's habit of being fond of boasting and seeking quick success. We always say that other people's crystallizations "already existed in ancient times," and therefore do not seek progress and fall behind in science. The words are earnest and thought-provoking.

The intelligence and ingenuity of the Chinese people are no less than those of any other country. This is an honest and unpretentious statement. What is lacking is that, with a smattering of knowledge, we become very conceited and think highly of ourselves. We like to play with mystery, to pretend to be clever, to keep secrets, and to be afraid of others knowing. Then there is no progress in research. Therefore, all inventions and discoveries, even if they "already existed in ancient times," are nothing more than superficial views, and "things remain as they were."

In the future, we must break the habit of mystery and arrogance and catch up with the spirit of continuous research and striving for excellence.

### Already Existed in Ancient Times vs. Now Exists

— Bing Ding

The appearance of the atomic bomb has attracted worldwide attention, and public opinion is shocked. Its power reaches thirty kilometers and leads the world's new weapons. It has had a great effect on this peace. Everyone praises the Americans as truly remarkable.

Suddenly, I heard that the atomic bomb was originally invented by the Chinese, and American scientists were only conducting research and manufacturing based on the Chinese theory. In this way, the United States is indeed great, and the Chinese are even more remarkable. The words are definite, with names and surnames, almost saying that this person has already split the Nobel Prize with American scientists. Later, I heard that there was indeed a Chinese scholar who first discovered a certain phenomenon of atomic bond disruption. Thus it spread around and became that the atomic bomb was invented by the Chinese. However, even a small discovery must have cost a lot of effort, but whether he has indeed won the Nobel Prize is still unknown. (Editor's note: This can be corroborated by Mr. Xing Zhiren's article about Zhou Houfu.)

We have always liked to take credit. For things that others have spent a great deal of effort on, we leisurely take a puff of cigarette and say contemptuously, "When the country was already developing planes, before the invention of planes, the carpenter already made wooden wheels to fly high," "Before Columbus was born, China knew that the earth was round," "Tanks are just Zhuge Liang's wooden oxen and flowing horses," "The theory of electronic entanglement is just the Chinese Taiji and Wuji." Indeed, indeed, our country's civilization is far more advanced than that of the barbarians. When the descendants of our Yellow Emperor were all dressed in Zhou-dynasty style clothing studying the Book of Changes, they were still drinking blood and living in caves as wild animals. Therefore, the four great inventions of our ancestors, such as gunpowder and the compass, left indelible achievements in human history. However, people use gunpowder to bomb the earth and open up mines, but we use gunpowder to make firecrackers to welcome gods. People use compasses for navigation and exploration, but we use them to determine directions and look at feng shui. For thousands of years, we have wasted our intelligence on stupid things that cannot be touched or seen. Therefore, people are speeding on streamlined trains, and we are still riding ancient wheelbarrows, walking slowly. However, we are still intoxicated with the four big words "already existed in ancient times", intoxicated by the four great inventions of the ancients, swallowing and spitting, spitting and ruminating on the ground, and even the original little essence cannot be preserved, let alone improved.

In fact, we are not the only country that likes to take credit. The Soviet Union boasts that it used electric lights before Edison invented the electric light. Japan says that Koklckl in the eighteenth century had already succeeded in test flights on the Ryogoku Bridge. However, although people are exaggerating, they are still working hard. The Soviet Union has fulfilled several five-year plans, and Japan has also learned the skills of manufacturing airplanes in eight years. Only we Chinese are still far behind. In addition to being able to invent wireless electric lights and cattle-powered engines, we cannot even make a small spring. Other people's existing technology, China still does not have today, and there was no such thing in ancient times. Therefore, our hope is that for all the science and technology that others have, our country does not need to have "already existed in ancient times", and even if we cannot have "now exists", at least we should have "will have now". Then, the way to revitalization and nation-building is perhaps near.

### A Record of Mr. Zhou Houfu

— Xing Zhiren

Two months ago, I saw in the newspaper that Professor Zhou Houfu, our nation's expert in physical chemistry, had won this year's Nobel International Prize in Chemistry. It was also mentioned that a reporter from the United States' Associated Press would personally visit this great Chinese scientist, who resides near Chongqing. When I read this simple piece of news, I felt an indescribable joy in my heart. China, which has always been scientifically backward and reliant on others, now has days of pride and glory. What is especially gratifying is that Mr. Zhou's award is said to be due to his great achievements in the study of atomic fission, which is the most advanced science of the 20th century, the extremely world-shaking atomic bomb.

Zhou Yuanfu studied abroad in his early years with the Boxer Indemnity. After returning to China, he served as the head of the Chemistry Department at National Zhejiang University in Hangzhou, patiently guiding students and tirelessly teaching. Before the war, he published a paper on the periodic table of elements in an English-language evening newspaper in Shanghai and sent letters to chemists in various countries, requesting their advice. Scientific experts from various countries discussed this paper extensively, considering it to have considerable research value. After the outbreak of the July 7th Incident, Zhejiang University moved from Hangzhou to Yanzhou, and then twice to Zunyi in Guizhou. Mr. Zhou continued to teach at Zhejiang University, and it seems that Mr. Feng Zikai mentioned him in his "Teacher's Diary."

Mr. Zhou also conducted research on agricultural chemistry. While at Zhejiang University, the authorities specially built a dedicated research lab for him. I heard that he also taught at a certain specialized college in Guizhou Province, but I'm unsure if this is accurate. Later, he was sent to England by the Ministry of Education to study electrical engineering and only returned to China in February of this year. The Associated Press reporter said that during his studies in England, his life was extraordinarily frugal. When he returned to China, he was even penniless in Calcutta and only managed to travel with the help of a friend. Scholars who are as self-motivated and hardworking as Mr. Zhou are rarely seen.
