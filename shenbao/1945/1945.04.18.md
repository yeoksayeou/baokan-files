### The Japanese Army Achieves a Great Victory in the Waters Around Okinawa Main Island; 31 Enemy Ships Sunk or Destroyed in Three Days

Announcement by the Imperial General Headquarters

Tokyo, 17th (Central News Agency dispatch) - The Imperial General Headquarters announced at 4 PM on the 17th: (1) The brave fighting of the Japanese air force and the defending troops on Okinawa Main Island complemented each other in the continued attacks on enemy warships and mobile units around the island. From April 14th to 16th, repeated fierce attacks were launched on the enemy units, inflicting heavy damage. Sudden attacks were also made on the northern and central airfields on the island, causing fires in 32 locations and throwing the enemy into great confusion. The results of the battle on the Japanese side that have been confirmed are as follows: 2 battleships sunk, 1 battleship or cruiser sunk, 1 large ship (believed to be an aircraft carrier) sunk, 2 cruisers sunk, 2 destroyers sunk, 8 ships of unknown type sunk (one of which is believed to be an aircraft carrier), 1 large ship (believed to be an aircraft carrier) destroyed, 3 transport ships sunk, and 8 ships of unknown type sunk. Most of the air force units participating in these attacks were special attack units. (2) On the night of April 15th, Japanese special water attack units attacked enemy ships in the waters off Kadena, sinking 2 ships of unknown type and destroying another one.

Tokyo, 17th (Central News Agency dispatch) - Japanese air force and special water attack units continued to fiercely attack enemy ships near Okinawa Island. In the three days of the 14th, 15th, and 16th, 18 ships were sunk and 13 were damaged. Since the start of the Okinawa Island battle, the total number of enemy ships sunk and damaged has reached 378.

### Enemy Mobile Unit Attempts to Move Again

Japanese Military Base in the Southwest Pacific, 17th (Central News Agency dispatch) - The enemy fleet around Okinawa Main Island is struggling to support the land-based enemy troops and is forcibly rising up to carry out cover operations. According to reconnaissance results on the 16th, enemy ships were discovered in the waters southeast of Kikai Island, including 2 regular aircraft carriers and 2 battleships. Slightly to the south, there was 1 regular aircraft carrier and 1 special attack aircraft carrier. Further south, there was another similar group with special aircraft carriers. There were three enemy mobile units, each with 1 regular aircraft carrier as its core. In addition, there was another unit patrolling around the Yaeyama Islands. Furthermore, near the Kerama Islands, 2 special aircraft carriers were discovered, bringing the total number of aircraft carriers to between 12 and 14, watching for an opportunity to strike. In the central waters around Okinawa Main Island, there was 1 cruiser, 4 destroyers, and about 100 transport ships. Several of the transport ships were on fire and burning, visible from land. In the waters near the northern airfield, there was a group fleet with 13 or 14 cruisers, 25 destroyers, and a number of minesweepers as its main force, relentlessly firing on the Japanese land defenses.

### Japanese Special Attack Units Launch Three General Offensives

Tokyo, 17th (Central News Agency dispatch) - According to a report from a special correspondent at a naval base: From the 16th, the Japanese air force began its third general offensive against the enemy fleet near Okinawa Island and the enemy mobile unit off the coast of Amami Ōshima. On the same day, army bomber units bombed and strafed enemy small and medium-sized bombers at the northern and central airfields. The next morning, Japanese air control units and Kamikaze special attack units launched a large-scale sortie from their bases. One unit crashed into the enemy fleet near the Kerama Islands, sinking 1 large ship and several other warships. Another special attack unit fiercely attacked two mobile units off the southeastern coast of Amami Ōshima, consisting of 2 aircraft carriers, 3 battleships, and more than a dozen other warships. In an attempt to contain the Japanese special attack units' general offensive, the enemy raided airfields in various parts of Kyushu at 10 AM and 1 PM. The attacking enemy planes numbered only a few dozen, including several medium-sized North American B25 bombers. In the afternoon, Japanese special attack units continued to sortie, flying over the southeastern coast of Amami Ōshima to attack 2 enemy aircraft carriers, 3 large ships, and several other warships.

Ryukyu Islands Base, 17th (Central News Agency dispatch) - Japanese army and navy special attack units are continuing their brave collision attacks against the enemy mobile unit gathered around Okinawa Island. The results of the attacks on the night of the 16th, as far as have been determined so far, include 1 cruiser sunk, 1 ship of unknown type sunk, 1 cruiser damaged, and 1 battleship or cruiser damaged.

### The Emperor Bestows Compassion on Disaster Victims; Issues a Gracious Imperial Rescript

Tokyo, 17th (Central News Agency dispatch) - His Majesty the Emperor, concerned about those suffering from war disasters, has bestowed a gracious Imperial Rescript, which was recently announced by the Imperial Household Ministry as follows:

As the war situation becomes increasingly critical, the enemy's aggression against our national territory is becoming more severe. I am deeply saddened to learn that subjects of the Imperial Nation have lost their lives, suffer from injuries, or have become bankrupt and unemployed, and that their lives are precarious. Therefore, I contribute money from my private funds to provide for the review of relief efforts. Each of you officials should deeply understand my intention and spread it to the populace so that my wishes may be fulfilled.

Tokyo, 17th (Central News Agency dispatch) - His Majesty the Emperor, concerned about the people under enemy air raids, previously dispatched personnel to inspect the situation on the ground and personally visited the disaster-stricken areas of Tokyo on March 18th. However, as enemy air raids have become more frequent in recent times and the number of victims has increased, the Emperor issued a gracious Imperial Rescript to the affected people on the 17th and granted 10 million yen from the national treasury for relief purposes. Prime Minister Suzuki entered the palace at 9 AM to receive the Imperial Rescript and then withdrew. Subsequently, the Prime Minister received the donation from Minister of the Imperial Household Matsudaira.

### The Battle for Air Supremacy Enters a Decisive Phase; The Japanese Army's Counterattack on Okinawa Island is Fierce

Tokyo, 17th (Central News Agency dispatch) - The Japanese air force's attacks on enemy mobile units and ships in the waters off Okinawa became even more intense after the 15th. Japanese special attack units, led by new fighter squadrons, launched fierce attacks day and night, engulfing the war zone in massive explosions and pillars of fire. The resistance of enemy carrier-based aircraft is gradually weakening. Despite the continuous attacks by the Japanese army, the enemy cannot ignore the survival of its land forces, so it stubbornly continues to reinforce and resupply them, adopting a do-or-die tactic. The enemy is also attempting to cut off the Japanese air force's rear support lines, using carrier-based aircraft to bomb Kyushu and B29 bombers to support and strengthen its bombing strategy of the Japanese mainland. The number of enemy planes attacking Kyushu on the 16th sharply decreased to just over 50. At the same time, enemy medium and small-sized aircraft stationed at the northern and central airfields on Okinawa Main Island have been suppressed by the Japanese air and land forces, limiting their ability to operate. Thus, the battle for air supremacy has entered a decisive phase. The dramatic reduction in direct support from enemy carrier-based aircraft during the Okinawa operation and the sluggish activity of enemy base air power are very obvious. All of this is due to the brave fighting of the Japanese special attack units, which has left the enemy land forces without support and has entered a major decisive phase.

Tokyo, 17th (Central News Agency dispatch) - The Japanese army's counterattack on Okinawa Island is becoming increasingly fierce. In the southern area, enemy forces are preparing to attack Japanese positions in front of Shuri. The Japanese army has been carrying out attacks daily. On the morning of the 16th, due to heavy losses on the front lines, the enemy replaced the troops with units from the rear. The General Headquarters has announced that the Japanese army killed a total of 1,700 enemy soldiers from the 12th to the 15th. However, it was later discovered that another 40 soldiers had been killed by the Japanese army. On the morning of the 15th, the enemy attacked Japanese positions under artillery support. The Japanese army engaged them in battle for six hours and then repelled them. On the other hand, the enemy landed on Minna Island at around 11 AM on the 15th, and the enemy also attempted to land on Ie Island.

### Enemy Planes Attack Kyushu; Investigation of Interception Results Underway

Tokyo, 17th (Central News Agency dispatch) - Approximately 80 enemy B29 bombers attacked Kyushu at 2 PM on the 17th, bombing various airfields. They retreated after an hour and a half. The Japanese authorities are currently investigating the results of the interception battle. The purpose of this enemy air raid appears to be to attack the Japanese air power base, and its tactics are noteworthy.

### Enemy Bombing of Shrines is a Planned Action

Tokyo, 17th (Central News Agency dispatch) - Following the previous enemy bombing of the Ise Grand Shrine in Japan, the Meiji Shrine was bombed again at dawn on the 14th. This shows that the enemy's attacks are a planned action. During the air raid on the 14th, not a single bomb was dropped in the vicinity of Yoyogi and Harajuku. Only incendiary bombs, approximately 1,300 in number, were dropped on the shrine. The enemy planes targeted only the main hall and the worship hall, which are very small areas within the vast shrine grounds surrounded by trees. Approximately 750 incendiary bombs have been unearthed in the burnt-out areas of the main hall and worship hall. The personnel protecting the shrine at the time made every effort to put out the fire, but some of the firefighting equipment was damaged by the bombing and could not be used. Before long, the fire spread to the main hall and worship hall. It appears that the enemy's intention is to destroy the central faith of the Japanese people. However, the Japanese people are united in their desire for revenge and are working hard to clean up the fire site. The work was largely completed by the 16th. Construction of a new main hall has begun at the shrine, and the divine seat will be temporarily placed in the treasure hall. Within a day or two, the general public will be able to visit and worship again.

Tokyo, 17th (Central News Agency dispatch) - Following the indiscriminate bombing of the Ise Grand Shrine on January 14th by enemy planes, the Japanese government has decided to promptly carry out restoration work. A cabinet meeting was held on the 17th, and 472,000 yen was allocated from the second reserve fund to repair the Kagura hall, the Purification hall, and other damaged buildings.

### Japanese Citizens Organize Special Attack Units to Fulfill the Mission of Defending the Nation; Alliance Ceremony Scheduled for the 25th

Tokyo, 17th (Central News Agency dispatch) - The Japanese people across the country have decided to organize the All-Japan National Special Attack Unit to repel the enemy invading the homeland. The founding ceremony and alliance ceremony are scheduled to be held at the Japan Pavilion in the Nakano Ward of Tokyo at 1 PM on the 25th. This organization is responding to the organizational policy of the National Volunteer Corps. It does not take any formal form but rises up automatically to defend the country. In the future, it will become the center of the National Volunteer Corps and fulfill its social responsibilities.

### The Battle of Laohekou and the Situation on the Mainland

Recently, there are two points in the East Asian war situation that are particularly noteworthy: The first is that the enemy America's offensive against Okinawa Island has slowed down somewhat after suffering heavy losses. Therefore, they have had to resort to a strategy of terror air raids, vainly attempting to disrupt the rear. The second is that on the Chinese mainland, the Allied forces are still maintaining their initiative and advantage, and their future is noteworthy. Now, let's briefly elaborate on the new situation on the Chinese mainland battlefield:

The so-called general counteroffensive on the mainland, or the June general offensive, can be roughly divided into three zones. The first is the Southwest Counteroffensive Line, with the Burma battlefield as its general base, including Burma, Yunnan, Guizhou, Guangxi, Hunan, and even Vietnam and Thailand. The second is the Central China Counteroffensive Line, centered on the Central Plains, i.e., the Fifth War Zone, attempting to cross the Pinghan and Yuehan railways eastward, extending north to the Yellow River and south to the south bank of the Yangtze River. The third counteroffensive line is the offensive in various coastal areas of Southeast China, actively increasing troops with the dual aim of intercepting the Japanese army and cooperating with the Allied forces' landing operations. In addition, the Communist army also has the ambition to launch attacks in North China and along the coast of Central China in order to cooperate with the so-called general counteroffensive and take the opportunity to expand its power.

Apart from the Communist's planned counteroffensive, which will be discussed separately, among the three counteroffensive lines of the anti-Axis strategic plan jointly devised by the Americans and Chongqing, the Central China line is undoubtedly the most important. Recently, Liu Zhi, a direct descendant of the Chongqing Central Government, was transferred to replace Li Zongren as commander of the Fifth War Zone. Furthermore, efforts are being made to expedite the completion of the Stilwell Road in order to actively increase the direct supply of American military supplies to the Fifth War Zone. The Fifth War Zone, the center of this counteroffensive strategic focus, is actively promoting various military deployments with Laohekou as its center. However, the Japanese army had discovered this attempt in advance, so they launched a counterattack last month and occupied Nanyang to the northeast, and several days ago, they occupied Laohekou, striking the heart of the Central China counteroffensive. From this point, the Japanese army can take Laohekou as its center, with Yichang to the left and Luoyang to the right, spreading its wings westward to cut off the transportation between Sichuan and Shaanxi provinces, threatening Yan'an to the north and encircling the rear of Chongqing to the south. Clearly, the enemy's general counteroffensive plan has been shattered in advance.

As for the so-called Southwest Counteroffensive Line, which is the general base for the general counteroffensive, nearly 100,000 intellectual youths have been mobilized and are receiving training from the Americans in Yunnan and other places. Many have also joined the expeditionary force to India and Burma. The Chongqing army, which has been re-equipped and reorganized by the Americans, is also concentrated in the southwest region. There have also been recent reorganizations in the command structure. Its future is noteworthy. However, the Japanese army in various areas of Burma, Vietnam, and Thailand is closely monitoring the enemy, and the Japanese army in Hunan and Guangxi has not relaxed its efforts to contain the enemy for a moment. Recently, a new offensive has been launched against Zhijiang in the southwest of Hunan Province, and the enemy's Southwest Counteroffensive Line is about to suffer a frontal breakthrough.

In the southeastern coastal area, the American and Chongqing forces have recently been actively increasing their strength, and the enemy's aircraft in that area are most active. Recently, attacks on cities along the Yuehan Railway and coastal port cities above Hong Kong and Guangzhou have also become more frequent. However, all major coastal cities from Shanghai to Hong Kong are under the protection of the Japanese army, and the defense capabilities have been further strengthened in the past month or two. Furthermore, further progress along the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway can be achieved at any time, so the enemy's attempts are not worth worrying about.

In short, the current situation on the mainland battlefield is about to undergo a major development with the occupation of Laohekou by the Allied forces as a turning point. As long as the overall situation on the mainland battlefield is stable, preventing the Americans from achieving their desires, then the enemy's movements on the ocean will only suffer heavy losses, leading to their eventual collapse. The more impatient the enemy becomes, the more calmly and resolutely we must respond.

### Recent Observations on International Politics

— Nan Gong

Recently, two major events have occurred internationally: One is the Soviet Union's notification to Japan that it will not extend the Neutrality Pact, and the other is the death of US President Roosevelt. Before discussing the future of Japanese-Soviet neutrality relations, we should first observe the development of anti-Axis relations. The cooperation between the Soviet Union and the United Kingdom and the United States is superficial. There are many contradictions on specific issues, and there is no possibility of uniting to the end. In addition, after Roosevelt's death, the anti-Axis alliance lacks an influential figure who can harmonize the opinions of various countries. Because the UK, the US, and the Soviet Union cannot cooperate closely, the relationship between Japan and the Soviet Union will not undergo unexpected changes, and neutrality can continue to be maintained. Let's first discuss the relationship between the anti-Axis countries:

(1) The relationship between the anti-Axis countries

The relationship between the US, the UK, and the Soviet Union has been greatly affected by Roosevelt's death. Roosevelt, Churchill, and Stalin appeared to be united in their opinions, but in reality, Churchill and Stalin had conflicting opinions. The Soviet Encyclopedia even noted that Churchill was the most anti-Soviet person in England. Only Roosevelt could gradually bring Churchill and Stalin closer. Now that Roosevelt has passed away, although Truman has succeeded as President of the United States, the US has lost a central figure, and the close ties between the three countries have been considerably affected by Roosevelt's death.

The Soviet Union's notification to Japan that it will not extend the Neutrality Pact was one of the decisions made at the Yalta Conference, that is, the request of the US and the UK. The exchange condition was that the US and the UK recognize the Soviet Union's right of freedom in a certain important area of East Asia. The aforementioned conditions have been revealed by the United Press, the New York Times, and British newspapers, saying that this is a major concession by the US and the UK to the Soviet Union. This is of great importance to Chongqing, but since it was not notified in advance, it is naturally dissatisfied. Because Chongqing did not participate in the Yalta Conference, it did not say a word other than expressing dissatisfaction with the free resolution of this issue by the three countries. From this point, we can also see the lack of unity among the United Nations. The UK has little interest in this area, while the US has ambitions for this area. The concession to the Soviet Union this time is probably due to the difficulties of their own manpower and resources.

Regarding the issue of Poland's participation in the San Francisco Conference, the US, the UK, and the Soviet Union had already reached an agreement at the Yalta Conference to set up a temporary government in Poland. After the three countries recognized it, they could send representatives to participate. Afterward, the Soviet Union suddenly overturned the decision and demanded that the Lublin government send representatives to participate. The US and the UK believed that this matter had already been decided at the Yalta Conference and should not be changed, so they rejected the Soviet request. This issue has not been resolved to this day. From this, we can see that the Yalta Conference seemed very satisfactory on the surface, but the consultation on specific issues was not yet satisfactory. American newspapers therefore heavily criticized the government's hasty actions. Regarding the issue of organizing a new international league, the three countries' opinions were also not the same on voting. At the Yalta Conference, it was decided that the US, the UK, and the Soviet Union would have absolute authority in the league's council, and that the US and the Soviet Union would each have three votes in the plenary meeting. American public opinion also strongly attacked this, wanting to overturn it. Because the UK, including Canada, New Zealand, Australia, India, and South Africa, has a total of six votes, the US and the Soviet Union demanded three votes in order to counter the UK. From this, we can see a glimpse of the conflict of interests with each other.

The domestic trends in the US and the UK are also important issues. In the United States, the most important thing is the opposition between the government and Congress. Regarding the handling of Pacific islands, the US Congress and the military both advocate permanent occupation, but Roosevelt decided at the Yalta Conference that they would be jointly managed internationally. If Roosevelt had not died, this kind of opposition could have been handled smoothly. Now that Truman has succeeded as President, his political skills are far inferior to Roosevelt's. It is expected that the relationship between the US government and Congress will become more complicated. Since opinions within the United States are divided, treaties that it makes with foreign countries will be affected and difficult to take effect. The US sent nine representatives to the San Francisco Conference. Apart from the Secretary of State, the Democratic Party and the Republican Party each had four people. This is the US government's intention to have both parties share responsibility.

Before the San Francisco Conference, the UK had already held a meeting in London. New Zealand and Australia opposed the League's council having too much power, which shows the lack of unity of opinion within the UK. The Indian issue is also an important event. Because the Atlantic Charter does not apply to India, when the Viceroy of India Wavell returned to London to discuss this issue, he believed that if the Indian issue was not resolved satisfactorily, there was a possibility of a third world war. This also shows the seriousness of the UK's internal problems. After the start of the war, the UK planned to form a coalition government with the Conservative Party and the Labour Party, but now the Labour Party has suddenly begun to attack the government, which is a sign that the two parties are about to split. The result of the development of this kind of domestic situation in the US and the UK will greatly reduce the opportunity for the two countries to assist each other. The cooperation between the US, the UK, and the Soviet Union is only superficial. In fact, they do not agree on specific issues.

(2) The future of Japanese-Soviet relations

The Japanese-Soviet relationship can be understood from the perspective of both sides. (1) From the Soviet perspective, its opinion is indeed the same as the US and the UK in terms of fighting Germany, but its opinion is not the same on Eastern issues. Furthermore, the future direction of the Soviet Union can be observed from its domestic situation. The Soviet Union suffered too much damage in this four-year war. It goes without saying that it is distressed. The post-war reconstruction issue is the issue that needs to be resolved urgently in the future. The Soviet Union has signed a 20-year mutual assistance treaty with the United Kingdom, which shows that its post-war reconstruction work is very important. The Soviet Union has also requested a loan of hundreds of millions of US dollars from the United States. The Soviet Union's current requirement is "need to rest."

(2) From the Japanese perspective, although the Soviet Union has notified that the Neutrality Pact will no longer be extended, Japan is still seeking to maintain a neutral relationship in good faith, because the treaty will not expire until April next year. The recent change of cabinet in Japan, with Togo taking over as Foreign Minister, has attracted much attention from the US and the UK. Togo is wise and insightful in the Japanese political and diplomatic circles. The Soviet Union also has a good understanding of Mr. Togo. From the Soviet perspective and Japan's statement of good faith, the future relationship between Japan and the Soviet Union can be foreseen.

(3) Conclusion

In summary, Japan's estimate of the importance of the war situation is not an overestimate, but Japan's goal of liberating the Greater East Asia War must be carried through to the end, and the Japanese people have also ignited the fire of fighting to the end. The more intense the war, the clearer the goal, and they will work hard to achieve it.

### German Leader Appeals to Soldiers and Civilians to Exert All Efforts to Resist the Enemy; Soviet Forces 45 Kilometers from Berlin

Berlin, 17th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - Huitong News: The German leader Hitler yesterday issued an appeal to officers and soldiers on the Eastern Front to resist the Red Army's massacres. It stated, in brief, that Berlin is still in German hands, Vienna will still belong to the Germans, and Europe will never be subject to the Russians. The current great war is indeed a disastrous calamity ordained by fate, but there is bound to be a turning point in the war situation. The leader's words were filled with steadfast passion. The leader continued in a sharp tone, saying that any soldier who fails to fulfill his mission under these circumstances is a traitor to the German people. What face do those who fail to hold their ground, be it a platoon or a division, and abandon it have to face the women and children who are enduring terrifying bombings? From now on, anyone who orders a retreat without authorization will be arrested on the spot, regardless of their rank, and, if necessary, executed on the spot.

### Governor Hao Pengju Discusses Political Reform in Huaihai

— Yifei

Huaihai Notes, Part Two

On the afternoon of April 5th, this reporter visited Governor Hao Pengju of Huaihai Province at the provincial government. When I was led into his "outer office," the first thing that caught my attention was two framed items hanging high on the wall: Governor Hao's handwritten "Oath for the Renewal of Life for Military and Political Personnel in Huaihai Province" and "Creed for Administrative Personnel in Huaihai Province." The oath begins with these touching words: "Today, the things that can ruin our noble character and glorious career are selfishness, hypocrisy, decadence, disunity, frivolity, and sloppiness, as well as lack of order, discipline, wasting time, wasting public property, and not keeping to schedules." This is precisely Governor Hao's model for building a new Huaihai.

In my imagination, Governor Hao was always some typical military man—authoritarian and impetuous. But when I stepped into his office, I was surprised to find before me an amiable and cultivated leader.

I first asked for his views on the construction of a new Huaihai and the "Youth Politics" movement currently being promoted. Governor Hao replied, "In this era when war clouds engulf every corner of the world, there is only destruction, and construction is out of the question. However, although Huaihai Province has been in a difficult environment for years, it has still been able to work hard and diligently in the construction of various departments. Just looking at the buildings in Xuzhou City and the opening of roads and dredging of rivers, there has been an average increase of 30 to 40 percent compared to before. It must be known that construction materials are extremely scarce in Huaihai Province. It is not easy to achieve such slight achievements under such difficult circumstances, which is somewhat gratifying.

"In the past, the political power of the Huaihai Provincial Government could completely reach the organizational cells at the lower levels without any barriers. Based on the achievements of recent years, more than two-thirds of the staff in the lower political echelons have received political training. In order to reassure them in their posts, we have broken the bad habit in our officialdom of 'a new emperor, a new courtier.' Therefore, even when the county magistrate is transferred, none of his subordinates are changed. Furthermore, county governments have long established treasuries separately, and accounting is completely independent, implementing a unified collection and disbursement system. The county government's economy is consolidated, and administrative operations can be carried out smoothly. This has been the consistent policy of Huaihai Province in the past. Recently, in order to thoroughly build a greater Huaihai, it was decided to implement 'Youth Politics.' The so-called Youth Politics is to use the youthful and vigorous spirit of young people as the driving force for promoting politics, and to use decisive and swift methods to eliminate the feudal remnants within Huaihai Province that hinder the construction of the new Huaihai. Such as eradicating local bullies and corruption, correcting folk customs, implementing compulsory education, raising the level of popular intelligence, and cultivating various talents. Currently, this political reform movement is being planned and promoted, and the date of implementation is not far off. It is planned to first train a group of high school graduates politically and then send them to various counties as administrative assistants. This measure has two goals: (1) to use the enthusiasm of youth to train the masses, so that they can be good citizens and cooperate with the government's ideals; (2) to use young people as the basic cadres to lead all difficult work. Therefore, 'Youth Politics' is to promote politics with a revolutionary spirit, in other words, it is the overall mobilization of the spirit of Huaihai Province, striving to achieve the ideal state of perfection." (To be continued)

### Decided to Prosecute Illegal Profiteering Merchants; Economic Police Authorities Strive to Suppress and Stabilize Prices

The prices of all goods in this city have soared recently, especially the black market price of rice, which has exceeded 15 [currency unit], causing a serious threat to the people's livelihood. Some illegal merchants are only trying to make exorbitant profits, taking the opportunity to raise prices without any regard for the people's livelihood, which has aroused great indignation from all walks of life. In order to thoroughly eliminate such illegal activities, the Economic Police authorities of this city held an emergency meeting at 11:00 AM on the 17th. After careful deliberation, they have come up with considerable measures and are determined to prosecute these illegal merchants. They will dispatch all economic police to conduct strict inspections of markets, shops, and firms throughout the city. Eleven major items must be sold in accordance with the limited prices assessed by the Commodity Evaluation Committee, and other items must also be sold in accordance with the prices agreed upon by the relevant trade associations.

### Situation in Bombed Areas in the Northern Part of This City

At around 4:00 AM on the 15th of this month, an enemy plane attacked Shanghai, indiscriminately dropping bombs in a certain area in the north. A Central News Agency reporter went to inspect the scene and saw that the roofs and floors of many houses and shops that were destroyed had been penetrated. Broken signboards, twisted beams, and rubble were everywhere. A bomb exploded in the middle of the road, shattering the windows of buildings even at a great distance. The glass windows and desks and chairs in the nearby school were also destroyed. The gas pipes, streetcar tracks, and power lines in the area are currently being repaired, and most of the important areas were repaired by the evening of that day. The reporter also saw that the area had adequate air-raid shelter facilities, which had played a great role, so only three people were killed.

### Reorganization of the General Association for Commercial Control's Organization

The General Association for Commercial Control of the Nation believes that wartime materials for national use and people's needs are extremely important, and actively promoting controlled economic policies is essential. The association has implemented organizational adjustments, personnel deployments, and work enhancements from the association itself to its affiliated control associations, in accordance with the decided steps, in order to quickly achieve the predetermined goals. It is reported that the General Association for Commercial Control and the control associations for rice, wheat flour, food, oil, and cotton have been very busy with various internal and external tasks recently. In addition to the very busy general affairs, they have also been implementing controlled materials plans and intensifying the procurement of goods. The management and guidance matters have become increasingly strict. The simplification of the control mechanism has been thoroughly completed after the adjustment, and the competent authorities are quite satisfied with this measure.

### Director Lu Takes Office at the Baoshan County Police Bureau

The previous director of the Baoshan County Police Bureau was dismissed due to the loss of city ammunition case. The municipal authorities attach great importance to the selection of his successor. After recommendation by the county administrative office, Chu Pei, the current first-class police officer of the police bureau, was transferred to succeed as the director of the county bureau. Chu comes from the military. Before the incident, he served as the director of the police station of the Public Security Bureau. After participating in the peace movement, he continued to serve as a commissioner for two consecutive years. Director Chu went to Baoshan on the 16th and immediately convened a meeting of officials to exhort them to focus on public security, pay attention to prevention, rectify discipline, endure hardships, and strictly abide by Mayor Zhou's instructions to ensure that there would be no more incidents of extortion.

### New Trade Associations Can Apply for Approval

The Municipal Economic Bureau is actively carrying out the adjustment and strengthening of trade associations in this city, and is working according to the formulated plan. For those who have already submitted the survey forms to the bureau, they will be individually summoned to talk with the chairmen of each association and records will be made to serve as reference materials for reviewing the soundness and unsoundness of each association. It is learned that, in addition to the more than 220 units of trade associations that have been registered and approved for establishment (which are the trade associations that were approved for establishment by the former Social Movement Guidance Committee), those that have not yet registered with the bureau can still apply for registration procedures. Those who newly organize associations can also request approval for establishment. Whether to approve or not to approve the organization rests entirely with the bureau, and the nature of the bureau's work on adjusting and strengthening the trade associations is fundamentally different.

### News Association Held Second Current Affairs Discussion Yesterday

The Shanghai Branch of the Chinese News Association held its second current affairs and reporting discussion meeting at the Huajia Club yesterday (the 17th) afternoon at 4:00 PM, inviting Director Matsudaira of the Information Department to attend and provide guidance. The representatives of the News Association who attended included Akahoshi, and the representatives of the member newspaper offices of the branch included Takashima Seima of the Continental News, Chen Binshu of Shen Bao, Xu Liqiu and Yang Huilang of the China Daily, Ni Sun of Ping Bao, Zheng Jie of New China Daily, Chen Ribing and Lu Feng of Xinwen Bao, and Jiang Xiaoguang and Zhu Yongkang of the National News, He Daxiong of Xin Shen Bao, and more than ten others. Chen Binshu first reported on the significance of the theme of the current affairs discussion meeting, and then invited Director Matsudaira to elaborate on the trends in the world political situation after the death of Roosevelt, especially the impact on the San Francisco Conference, and the role of the Soviet Union's temporary change of the chief representative to the San Francisco Conference, which was very detailed. He also commented a lot on the fact that the new US President Truman did not attend the San Francisco Conference. Then, representatives of various member newspaper offices, such as Xu Liqiu and Lu Feng, successively raised various questions, which Director Matsudaira answered in detail one by one, and the meeting ended at around 6:00 PM.

### Wang Maoting, the Main Culprit in the Gambling Den Case, Retracts His Confession; Director Li of the New City Branch Publicly Announces the Truth

Regarding the "Russian Emigrant General Association" gambling den case, the police bureau cracked it down and arrested the den owner Wang Maoting, manager Wei Huaqing, and others, who have been punished according to law. However, during the court hearing in the local court, the den owner Wang Maoting actually retracted his previous confession and denied the charges of "den owner" and "bribery." Moreover, regarding the bribery part, he stated that Director Li of the New City Branch was soliciting funds for the police welfare society from him, especially donating 300,000 yuan, and giving Li a 300,000 yuan check from the Continental Bank, which was not bribery. People from all walks of life expressed suspicion. Yesterday, the reporter specifically visited Director Li to inquire about the truth of the case. He replied: "Regarding Wang Maoting's opening of a gambling den and gathering people to gamble, he has confessed without denying it. As for the bribery part, he also confessed to it, and his statement in court that it was due to a mutual friend soliciting funds for the police welfare society is even more absurd. It is now found that the fundraising for the police welfare society was still last year. After Zhou took over as the director, he allocated 10,000 yuan for maintenance funds and announced it in the newspapers, so there was no need to solicit donations. Furthermore, since it was a donation, there should be a receipt, so where is the receipt? It can be presented to the court for inspection. At the same time, donating money is a glorious act, so why didn't he state it during the bureau's investigation and confess to bribery? In short, the facts are clear and it is ultimately difficult to deceive the court and the bureau. If necessary, I can go to court to confront him, and I will never allow him to quibble."

### Register Self-Provided Engines

The Municipal Construction Bureau believes that due to the reduction in electricity supply, various public places and factories in this city have installed engines, but all such installations must be registered and inspected in accordance with the regulations. However, most of the manufacturers in this city who have installed engines have not applied in accordance with the regulations, which is not in accordance with the law. In order to unify management, special regulations have been drawn up and approved by the municipal government to start registration immediately. All those in this city who have self-provided engines must apply for inspection to the second section of the bureau in accordance with the regulations before May 15. Those who fail to do so will be severely punished.

### Vehicle Registration Offices in Suburbs Abolished

Regarding vehicle registration and inspection in the suburbs of this city, the former Public Works Bureau had vehicle registration offices. Since the establishment of the Construction Bureau, the administration of each county has long been unified, and vehicle registration work is difficult to command due to the distance. This work should be transferred to the county government for direct management. Therefore, the vehicle registration offices in each county will be abolished so that they can be handed over to the county government to take charge of the matter.

Director Xu appointed Secretary Yun of the Price Evaluation Council to receive them on his behalf. He expressed deep concern for the industry's situation and promised to find a way to help. It is reported that the industry will resume business in its entirety from today.

### Changning Bureau Severely Punishes Police for Extortion

The Changning Road Police Station, on the eve of the Zhongshan Park, found three people transporting six stones of rice. Because their behavior was suspicious, they were taken to the station for questioning. According to the confession, the police officers at the Sanjing Temple sentry post extorted 1,000 yuan and privately allowed them to pass through the sentry post. The station director Yao Benyuan enforced the law like a mountain and immediately dismissed the police officer Hu Tonghua, and the police chief Yuan Qingquan was also given a demerit and reported to the General Bureau for transfer to the procuratorate for severe punishment.

### Long-Distance Buses on All Routes Levy Transit Tax

Recently, the highways between this city and the nearby Songjiang, Qingpu, Taicang, Kunshan, and other counties, as well as Suzhou, Wuxi, Changzhou, Jiading and other places, have become increasingly smooth, and many travel agencies use long-distance buses to carry goods and passengers, and their business is extremely prosperous. It is learned that the Upper Song District Transit Tax Office of the Ministry of Finance has ordered the bus operators to collect the transit tax for passengers on these long-distance vehicles in accordance with the law in order to enrich the national treasury revenue.

### Truman Distorts Words and Misinterprets, Attempting to Deceive the World; Minister Matsudaira Refutes His Message

The Shanghai Office of the Allied Japan Embassy held a routine press conference yesterday afternoon. Information Minister Matsudaira expressed several points on the impressions of the message delivered to Congress by the new American President Truman. The main points are recorded as follows:

Main Points of the Message

The new American President Truman delivered a message to Congress yesterday. As a rule, the US president clarifies his policy in the message to Congress in January of each year, so Truman also followed the example by sending a message to Congress at the beginning of his term. The main points included in his message are as follows:

He recognized President Roosevelt as the initiator of the ideal of peace, expressed great respect, and said that world peace must be led by Roosevelt in order to be completed.

The late President Roosevelt advocated that true security should be based on law and justice.

In order to maintain the American way of life and to uphold freedom, we should continue to strive to promote the liberation of all mankind in the world.

He praised the heads of the US Army and Navy and explained the current state of the war.

He stated that he could not discuss the issue of peace mechanisms with those who destroy peace.

The responsibility of a strong country is not to conquer the world, but to serve the world. Finally, Truman asked the members of Congress to cooperate unanimously.

Minister's Impressions

Minister Matsudaira expressed his impressions on Truman's message, saying:

Although the various points listed in Truman's message seem detailed, they are generally too abstract and focus too much on justification. It does not mention any new ideas on how to promote progress in the world and develop agriculture.

Although the United States has repeatedly used law and justice as its mantra, what it actually shows is oppression against neutral countries, especially exploitation against Central and South American countries, and various unequal treatments against blacks and Asians within the United States, so no matter what, chanting law and justice is not worth the smile of the wise.

The so-called responsibility of a strong country is not to conquer the world, but to serve the world, but why does it advocate unconditional surrender to Japan and Germany? Is this claim not different from conquest? This kind of one-sided method of resolving the situation, using beautiful words to achieve its ambition to deceive the world and practice unconditional surrender, is obvious.

Who are the so-called destroyers of peace? Before the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the United States gave us various oppressions that were the same as war, and ruined our peace negotiations, so we had no choice but to resort to war.

In short, the cause of war in the world is due to the lack of balanced distribution of living resources between the land and population of various countries in the world. Americans do not investigate the cause, but instead only respect themselves and speak shamelessly. Who will believe it?

### The New President of the United States – Truman

(An explanation from the American magazine "Time" by the Central News Agency)

The American people prefer a Vice President who doesn't stir up unnecessary troubles and doesn't make mountains out of molehills. He should diligently serve during his term, and then retire quietly into anonymity. A Vice President is useful when the President passes away. In American history, six presidents have died in office, and there's a saying almost as old as the history of the American Republic: "The difference between the President and the Vice President is just a heartbeat."

Thus, in 1944, the general electorate (Republican) chose Harry Truman as Vice President—a member of the Republican Party, a young man from Missouri.

The "Anti-New Deal newspapers" had investigated Truman's life and background. However, even before the investigation, people already knew two main contradictory aspects of Truman:

He was a trusted confidant of the notorious Kansas City boss, Pendergast.

Truman was an excellent chairman of the Senate Committee Investigating the National Defense Program.

Truman loved to wear double-breasted gray suits. His college education was only briefly spent at the Kansas City School of Law. He was not a handsome man, but he possessed a gentle character, thin lips, thick-rimmed glasses, and a Missouri drawl. Before the age of thirty-three, he worked on his father's farm, and then rose through the political ranks—a sharp-eyed political opportunist. He was rough, ordinary, like an old pair of shoes.

He always wore pajamas every night and played poker with reporters. He loved to drink beer, and he was a glutton, but he could still fit into his military uniform made during World War I. He was five feet tall, had a thirty-three-inch waist, and weighed 167 pounds. (To be continued)

### Children's Dental Clinic Prevents Dental Problems for Students of Free Schools

We received a letter yesterday from the staff of the Children's Dental Clinic, willing to provide free dental check-ups and treatments for students of the free schools run by this newspaper. The clinic's enthusiasm for service is truly admirable. The original letter is recorded as follows: "Your newspaper promotes free schools, benefiting underprivileged children, which is of profound significance. However, while children's education is undoubtedly important, their physical health should also not be neglected. In modern civilized countries, dental school doctors are invariably appointed, but our country still lacks this. Considering this, the staff of our clinic are willing to serve as volunteer dental school doctors for the first to tenth free schools run by your newspaper, in order to promote this. The regulations are as follows:

1.  To visit the school for oral examinations once or twice a year (the date is to be designated by the school).

2.  If treatment is required after the examination, with the consent of the parents, a certificate can be issued by the principal, and the parents can accompany the treatment.

3.  Temporary emergencies—such as oral trauma, toothache, tooth root decay, facial swelling, and various diseases in the mouth—can also be treated on a voluntary basis." (Note: The address of the Children's Dental Clinic is No. 11, Lane 54, Avenue Joffre (Xiafei Market), telephone number 7692).

### Donation Report for Free School Funds

Jiangmin of the People's Cooperative donated 10,000 yuan, Bai Xiuqing donated 1,000 yuan, totaling 11,000 yuan.

Donation Report of this Newspaper

Medical and Recreational Fund: Dai Miaoying 5,000 yuan. Midwifery Fund: Wang Yiwu 5,000 yuan. Relief Fund for the Poor: Wang Yangwu 5,000 yuan.
