### The Imperial Japanese Headquarters Announced Yesterday That the Manila Garrison Is Fighting Valiantly; Enemy Paratroopers Landed East of Nasugbu

Tokyo, 6th (Central News Agency) – The Imperial Japanese Headquarters announced at 4:00 PM on the 6th: A portion of the enemy forces infiltrated a corner of Manila City from the north on the evening of the 3rd. Japanese forces in that area are currently holding key points inside and outside the city, fighting fiercely to intercept the enemy.

Japanese Military Base on the Philippine Front, 6th (Central News Agency) – A portion of the enemy's tank units infiltrated a corner of northern Manila City on the evening of the 3rd. Simultaneously, a portion of the enemy's paratrooper units advanced to the Kagojang area north of Manila City. Currently, Japanese forces in Manila City are deploying troops on key roads within the city and firmly holding strong positions in the highlands east of Manila, engaging in fierce battles inside and outside the city with the enemy forces that have infiltrated Manila. After this incursion into Manila, the enemy forces have penetrated deep into the Japanese army's final prepared defensive positions for protracted warfare. Under the command of General Yamashita, the elite Japanese forces will continue to engage in full-scale attrition warfare.

Former Red Island in the Philippines, 6th (Central News Agency) – To reinforce their forces in southern Luzon, the enemy used approximately 70 transport planes on the morning of the 4th, fully loaded with troops, to land near the east of Nasugbu.

Lisbon, 6th (Central News Agency) – General MacArthur's headquarters announced on the morning of the 5th: A portion of the American forces has entered Manila City. It is reported that the initial assault troops were the U.S. 1st Infantry Division, which advanced south from Lingayen.

### Overview of the Battle Situation in Luzon

Tokyo, 5th (Central News Agency) – The enemy forces on Luzon Island consist of the 78th Division, which landed in Lingayen Gulf, and the two divisions of the 8th Corps, which landed on the coast of Subic Bay on January 30th, as well as a portion of forces that landed in Nasugbu southwest of Manila Bay on the 31st, which appears to total ten divisions. After landing in Lingayen Gulf, the enemy forces swept through the central plains of Luzon with their main force, seemingly poised to directly assault Manila. However, after the enemy forces landed, their southward offensive was significantly constrained due to the Japanese army's Yamashita Corps' close combat assaults. The main force of the enemy landing army, consisting of three divisions of the 1st Corps, attacked the Japanese army's positions in the eastern coastal area of Lingayen, while two divisions attacked the Japanese army's positions in the eastern mountainous area of the central plains. As the two divisions of the 14th Corps advanced south from the central plains area and approached the Clark area, they encountered fierce resistance from the Japanese army, which had constructed strong fortifications in the mountainous area west of Clark. As a result, the enemy forces separately landed new forces from Subic Bay on the 30th and from Nasugbu on the 31st, to contain the Japanese army and support the southward-bound forces, adopting a strategy of pressing towards Manila. Furthermore, the enemy landing forces in Nasugbu were subjected to fierce attacks by the Japanese army in the mountainous area of Batangas, which impeded their advance. Therefore, on the 3rd, an airborne unit of approximately one regiment in strength was landed near Tagaytay, about 55 kilometers south of Manila, in an attempt to open up the route to Nasugbu. At the same time, a portion of the southward-bound forces in the central plains detoured from near San Fernando and entered an area without Japanese resistance. On the 3rd, the enemy forces formed an armored unit of a dozen or so tanks, and a portion of it gradually infiltrated a corner of Manila City via near Agoo (35 kilometers north of Manila). The Japanese Yamashita Corps immediately inflicted heavy damage on the enemy using its unique close-quarters combat tactics. At the same time, the main force of the Japanese army formed strong interception positions on the eastern coast of Lingayen, the longitudinal mountainous area on the eastern side of the central plains of Luzon, and the mountainous area east of Manila, closely monitoring the enemy's operational movements. During the initial stages of the Greater East Asia War, when the Japanese army was conducting operations to subdue the Philippines, the enemy American and Filipino forces immediately abandoned Manila City and defended the fortress of Corregidor with their main force, attempting to resist the Japanese army. This demonstrates that Manila City itself has no value from a military or strategic standpoint. Capturing Manila has been a slogan of the United States since the counteroffensive began on Guadalcanal Island. However, its purpose is merely to bring some comfort and satisfaction to the American people. In the current phase of the war, the Japanese army no longer needs to attach importance to such propaganda value. The Japanese army is intercepting the enemy forces, causing them to suffer heavy losses in manpower and throwing themselves into a trap. This is the strategic mission of the Japanese Yamashita Corps. The enemy's eagerness to occupy Manila is causing them to penetrate deep into the Japanese army's positions along the plains area. However, this is precisely what the Yamashita Corps desires. After the enemy forces occupy Manila, they will certainly use it as propaganda, claiming to have controlled all of Luzon. However, the mission of the Japanese army is to inflict heavy damage on the enemy. Therefore, the gain or loss of a city or a location is not important. The Japanese army is currently building extensive and deep defensive positions in the mountainous area on the eastern side of the central plains of Manila, the mountainous area west of Clark, and the mountainous area east of Manila, continuing to operate actively. Therefore, we have great expectations for the future valor of the Japanese army.

### Solemn Ceremony for the Emperor's Birthday

His Majesty the Emperor personally attended the shrine, and a solemn ceremony was held with the participation of Japanese and Manchu officials and civilians. On this day, the Emperor, who is celebrating his fortieth birthday, wore an army uniform and prayed before the shrine at 10:00 AM for the victory of the Greater East Asia War and the prosperity of the nation.

### A Tourist's Notes on Yangzhou

— By Tan Ming, Special Correspondent for This Newspaper

Yangzhou has been a major city on the Yangtze River since ancient times, and therefore still has Jiangdu County. Anyone who has read modern history knows that its past prosperity made it one of the leading scenic spots in central China. However, when we come here today, all that meets the eye can only allow us to savour the vestiges of history.

Yangzhou suffered from the calamities of war two or three hundred years ago. Anyone who has read the "Ten Days of Yangzhou" knows this. However, it was completely untouched in this recent war, and the friendship between the Chinese and Japanese people here is also very good. Since the Second Route Army moved here with Commander-in-Chief Sun, the Subei Pacification Commissioner's Office has been located in Yangzhou, so Yangzhou has naturally become the capital of this special administrative district, which highlights the importance of its political position.

Military and Political Affairs

The current Subei Pacification Commissioner's Office also manages general civil affairs in its jurisdiction, and therefore has a Political Affairs Department. The Political Affairs Department is divided into six sections: Civil Affairs, Finance, Construction, Education, Police Security, and Propaganda. Its jurisdiction also covers fifteen counties: Jiangdu, Yizheng, Gaoyou, Baoying, Yancheng, Funing, Taixian, Xinghua, Jingjiang, Rugao, Nantong, Haimen, Qidong, Dongtai, and Hai'an, with three Administrative Police Commissioners stationed in Jiangdu, Nantong, and Taixian. After the Second Route Army arrived, new progress is expected in the administration and construction of the counties, especially for the garrison troops, which have been poor in quality in the past, and will be reorganized. Only the Xth Division, led by Army Commander Yan Xiuwu, is still retained in the Subei region. There is also an independent unit. As for the Second Route Army, it is said to have 10,000 men, including the Xth and Xth Armies. There is also an independent division and a special service regiment. Currently, the main force of the Second Route Army is concentrated around the X area. A special service regiment is stationed in Yangzhou, while the Xth Division is in Taixian.

In the past, the discipline of the garrison troops in Subei was not very good, which created opportunities for bandits to run rampant. Since the Second Route Army arrived, they are now planning a comprehensive suppression and defense plan for each county. However, wandering bandits are still rampant. For example, in Yangzhou, although the county has nine districts, the administration of the eighth and ninth districts is effectively impossible. The Slender West Lake, known as a scenic spot in Yangzhou, cannot be accessed beyond Ping Shan Tang by tourists, so the guarantee of security still relies on Commander-in-Chief Sun's forces.

Speaking of the administration of Subei, there were many corrupt practices in the past. Some county magistrates bought their positions with money. Things are much better now, but it is said that banquets, gifts, and personal connections are still unavoidable. There are even those who are particularly proficient in Japanese and act arrogantly and unrestrainedly. Now Sun has decided to put Subei in order, and perhaps there will be drastic personnel changes soon!

People's Livelihood

Although I have only been in Yangzhou for four or five days, I have deeply felt the leisure and comfort of life here. Taking the daily life of Yangzhou residents as an example, the well-known saying "Skin wrapped in water in the morning, water wrapped in skin in the evening" has long proven the life of ease and comfort of some residents. Most of the wealthier people in Yangzhou are lazy, especially the sons of some wealthy families, who often develop bad habits as early as the age of thirty. As for me, I have been treated too comfortably every day since I arrived in Yangzhou. Especially the snacks here, I am afraid that there is no other place in China that can match their delicacy. Not only are the snacks and dumplings far superior to those in Beijing and Shanghai, but many of the sweet snacks are also unmatched anywhere else. The noodles here are famous for duck noodles, and ducks are more expensive than chickens when eating, which is a unique phenomenon.

County Administration

It is said that Jiangdu County can collect more than two million shi of rice annually (calculated after the implementation of actual collection). However, "collection of actual goods" is only a nominal, and the county government still collects from farmers at the black market price of rice. Today, taxes in Subei are still collected by the county government, so being a magistrate in Yangzhou has always been a coveted position. I don't know how it is now. Taking the county government's buildings as an example, they are much grander than the current Subei Pacification Commissioner's Office presided over by Sun Liangcheng. It is also not easy to meet the person in charge of the county government. It is said that the current county magistrate, Jiang X, speaks excellent Japanese and is probably a student who studied in Japan.

The narrowness of the streets in Yangzhou is truly astonishing. After the snow, they melt every day, making them difficult to walk on, and the snow is never cleared. As it stands, it will take a month for the streets to dry up even if it doesn't rain. There is only one road here, which was once called Boling Road and is now renamed Xinma Road. Since Sun Liangcheng and his troops came to Subei, they have actively ordered the county government to improve the road administration. It is said that the highway from Liuwei to Yangzhou was ordered to be completed by the county government within five days last month, otherwise, military law would be enforced. Therefore, it has now been repaired, and workers are often seen working on Xinma Road.

Culture

Education here, like in other small cities, is in a state of decline after the incident. In addition to the provincial high school, there is also a county high school (but only a junior high school). The salaries of general teachers are even more miserable. When I was in Binjiang, I heard that there was already a relief plan there, which was to donate a large sum of money from all walks of life and distribute relief funds to all primary and secondary school teachers. I don't know if the Yangzhou education authorities have paid attention to this?

The Subei New News, published in Yangzhou, is only half a large sheet per day, and the content is also very poor. Other cultural undertakings are even less to be mentioned. However, one day I passed by Church Street and saw that the building of the Yangzhou Theater was unusually magnificent, which shows the residents' indulgence in ease and pleasure.

Prices

Finally, speaking of general prices, although rice is only 18,000 yuan per shi and pork is only 350 yuan per catty, they are still not lower than in Zhenjiang and Nanjing. Because other goods are more expensive. For example, bathhouses are much more expensive than in Nanjing and Zhenjiang. For a medium bath, two or three people cost three to four thousand yuan. A top-notch official-style basin costs nearly two to three thousand yuan per person. If there are four or five people in a family here, they need at least more than ten thousand yuan a month to live. The rise in prices everywhere is really a very dangerous thing.

### Japanese Naval Forces Attack Enemy Transport Ships; Six or Seven Ships Sunk or Burned

Philippines, 6th (Central News Agency) – On the afternoon of the 1st, Japanese naval forces attacked enemy transport ships on the sea north of Lubang Island, causing six or seven of them to be sunk or burned.

Enemy Task Force Repairs Ships

Tokyo, 6th (Central News Agency) – Since the enemy American forces entered Manila on the 3rd, the battle situation in Luzon has become increasingly critical. Currently, the enemy forces are advancing in all directions on the island: approximately two divisions near the Lingayen mouth and the northeastern highlands, around Clark Field, two divisions in the Manila area, two divisions in Subic, and two divisions in the Nasugbu area, totaling eleven divisions. The enemy forces are also connecting the areas from the mouth of Lingayen Gulf to the plains of Manila, controlling air bases in the South Sea. Many airfields have been completed in the north and central areas of the island, currently housing 800 to 1,000 aircraft. Furthermore, the enemy's 38th Task Force is repairing damaged ships in the rear bases and has the potential to reappear in the South Sea and even eastern Taiwan. Therefore, the movements of the enemy forces around the Philippines are highly noteworthy.

Japanese Forces Inflict Heavy Damage on Enemy on Bohol Island

Japanese Military Base on the Philippine Front, 6th (Central News Agency) – On January 18th, approximately 3,000 American troops landed on Bohol Island, located between Leyte Island and Cebu Island. The Japanese forces in that area immediately responded with outnumbered troops, engaging in close combat assaults day and night, inflicting heavy damage on the enemy. Although they have been fighting bloody battles for ten days, their morale is still extremely high and they are continuing to fight valiantly. The confirmed results of the battle so far include: destroying two mountain guns, five tanks, three barracks, two heavy trucks and landing craft, destroying one landing craft, capturing four heavy machine guns, ten light machine guns, four automatic rifles, 99,000 rounds of ammunition, and killing more than 500 enemy soldiers.

### Japanese House of Representatives Passed Resolution on Wartime Measures Yesterday; New Political Group to Be Established

Tokyo, 6th (Central News Agency) – At the reopening of the current session of the Japanese House of Representatives, in response to the severe war situation, emphasis was placed on establishing a strong political system, and based on the expectation of actively implementing wartime measures, questions were vigorously raised in the plenary session, the general budget committee, and the special committee on bills. At the plenary session on the 7th, as the overall intention of the House of Representatives, the honor of immediately implementing wartime measures was entrusted to Iichiro Se, Director of the Wing Political Standing Committee, to explain the purpose of the proposal, which was unanimously passed. When explaining the purpose of the resolution, it was also strongly criticized that it should be actively implemented, especially regarding the completion of the war, establishing a wartime national life, increasing military production, and the local defense corps, and emphasized trust in the national war guidance for winning the war, utilizing the young generation, and urging the government to act from the standpoint of the people.

Tokyo, 6th (Central News Agency) – The issue of the new party, which is the biggest political issue in this session of the Japanese Diet, has been outlined after Prime Minister Koiso answered Mr. Nagata Katsuta's question on the 2nd. Regarding the characteristics of the upcoming party, there are the following points: (1) The new political group will be formed by the willing participation of patriots and will be a non-governmental, people's group. (2) It will not be centered on the Wing Political Association, which is currently the only political organization, but will welcome the participation of young people across the country who are passionately pursuing political desires. (3) The principle of the new political group is not to exclude other political organizations. Therefore, the issue of forming a new party is based on the following principles and is expected to be established quickly. What methods this new party will use to achieve its organizational structure has attracted the attention of various sectors. Although the Wing Political Association has decided to dissolve after the establishment of the new group, the new group is not government-sponsored, and from the current stage of the situation, it is not permissible to simply reorganize the Wing Political Association on the surface. Therefore, in addition to establishing a political system that is sure to win within the country, the highest guiding goal is to complete the Greater East Asia War, strengthen cooperation with the citizens of the allied Republic of China and Manchuria, as well as the various ethnic groups of Greater East Asia, and take the completion of the war and the construction of a new order in Greater East Asia as the guiding principle to succeed. In this sense, the responsibility for promoting the formation of the new party is great. The government should not change its past practices and give full cooperation. Whether its realization is successful depends on the extent of the government's and politicians' decisive judgments and efforts to adapt to the national crisis. At the same time, there is great anticipation for the movement to establish the new party.

Editorial

### Public Interest Is More Important Than Private Interest

In recent years, because of high prices, most people, especially those on salaries, have found life difficult. However, some profiteers and some corrupt officials have not been threatened by high prices. Instead, they have seized unfair profits from the volatility of high prices. Because profiteers can seize huge profits from the volatility of high prices, they are creating opportunities for high prices to fluctuate at any time, or at least they are helping to fuel the volatility of high prices.

As a result of high prices in recent years, the gap between rich and poor in society has widened, and the disparity in happiness and suffering has become even greater. Salaried people are struggling to make ends meet, while profiteers continue to enjoy themselves to the fullest. The saying, "Behind the vermilion gates, meat and wine are left to rot; along the road lie the bones of those who have frozen to death," can be seen everywhere in the current society of Shanghai.

As a result of this abnormal phenomenon, people's hearts are treacherous, they are competing for private gain, morality has declined, and public interest is disregarded. Not only is "the individual before society, private interest more important than public interest," but even "there is only the individual, no society; only private interest, no public interest." This is contrary to what Mayor Zhou proposed in his letter to the citizens: "Public interest is more important than private interest, society is before the individual."

A person who only cares about himself and private interests does not necessarily lack ambition. His intelligence and talent are not inferior to others, and his ability to accumulate wealth and compete for profit is higher than average. Unfortunately, his ambition, intelligence, and ability to compete for profit are too narrowly focused, only for himself and his family, only for his descendants, but not for the whole society, not for the whole country. As long as he has enough to eat and wear, he does not think about others who have nothing to eat and wear. The more selfish people there are, the more abnormal and corrupt the society becomes. Selfish people have always existed, but there are especially many of them in the current society of Shanghai.

Wealth obtained through profiteering can still be redeemed and understood by society if it is used for public welfare. But if you only seek selfishness, personal enjoyment, then you will never get the understanding of society. Even if the country has no laws to punish you, public opinion will surely rise up to punish you. Moreover, only being private and not public is impossible at any time. It is even more impossible in the current wartime. In times of chaos, chaotic and unforeseen events can happen at any time. Hoarding gold is useless, and hoarding goods is also useless. The Shanghai of today is no longer the safe haven of the concession era. Once something happens, there will be no intact eggs under an overturned nest. Gold cannot satisfy hunger or keep you warm, and goods will not be available for free use. When the Japanese army occupied Hong Kong three years ago, 500 Hong Kong dollars were as good as waste paper. A wealthy merchant hid hundreds of thousands of Hong Kong dollars in cash and hired Indian guards to watch over them, but instead lost his life. These are all recent lessons. If you say that you can close the iron gate and hire bodyguards to be safe, that is definitely not the case.

Selfish people are also the most stingy. They will spend a fortune on their own enjoyment, but will not contribute a penny to public welfare. When they are kidnapped, they are willing to pay because they want to save their lives. When they are threatened by powerful people, they are also willing to pay because they are afraid of trouble. When they are blackmailed, they also pay without resistance. But when you explain the benefits of morality and ask them to donate money for public welfare, most of them retreat and make excuses. As the saying goes, "If you don't drink a toast, you'll have to drink a penalty drink." That's what these people are like.

Speaking of this, we must solemnly point out that all people living in Shanghai have a responsibility to maintain the security and welfare of the entire Shanghai society. In particular, people in the business community and wealthy people must exert the spirit of contributing money and effort to jointly maintain the security and welfare of Shanghai. We must fully achieve what Mayor Zhou expects: "Public interest is more important than private interest, society is before the individual." Secondly, we must also solemnly point out that due to the progress of the current situation, Shanghai has potential crises, and we must do our best under the guidance of the government to eliminate the crises. We also believe that this is the best opportunity for those who have made fortunes through speculation in recent years to make amends, and it is also the most stable move to truly plan for themselves and their descendants.

One urgent matter at the moment is to ensure public security with the cooperation of officials and civilians. We must fully provide the military and police personnel who are responsible for public security with sufficient living wages. On the one hand, we must help the government to rectify tax collection, and on the other hand, we must encourage the military and police to provide better service. The extortion of the police in the past was unanimously condemned, but this behavior has been eliminated due to the authorities' rectification and increase in treatment. From the standpoint of our citizens, we should also show our assistance to the government and encouragement to the military and police.

In theory, our suggestion can be said to be easy to do. Moreover, we have explained in detail above the relationship between the individual and society, as well as between public interest and private interest. We expect that most members of society can be moved and agree with this. At the same time, it can also be seen as a touchstone for whether members of society can change their character and achieve public interest over private interest.

### Temporary Measures for Punishing Acts Impairing the Supply and Demand of Goods in the Capital Promulgated by the National Government

Nanjing, 6th (Central News Agency) – The National Government, in an order dated February 6th, hereby enacts and promulgates the Temporary Measures for Punishing Acts Impairing the Supply and Demand of Essential Goods in the Capital. This order is hereby issued.

Nanjing, 6th (Central News Agency) – To thoroughly suppress commodity prices in the capital, the central authorities have established the Capital Commodity Price Stabilization and Discipline Committee. This committee will initially focus on eight essential goods in the capital city area: rice, firewood, salt, oil, pork, chicken, duck, and fish. Adhering to the principle of promptly addressing and eliminating harm, and with a spirit of close supervision, correction, and enforcement, it aims to thoroughly achieve the goals of facilitating supply and suppressing commodity prices. Although the implementation of these measures has been brief, the supply of rice, firewood, and other commodities in the capital city area has indeed transitioned from blocked to open, and from open to smooth. Consequently, market prices have moved from high to stable, achieving significant and expected results. Henceforth, anyone who uses illegal means to impair the supply and demand of the aforementioned eight essential goods, regardless of their identity, will be prosecuted under military law. To implement its determination to suppress commodity prices, and to achieve practical results in the short term, the National Government authorities have also formulated and promulgated Temporary Measures for Punishing Acts Impairing the Supply and Demand of Essential Goods in the Capital. The original text of these temporary measures is transcribed below:

Article 1: Any cases involving the use of various means to impair the supply and demand of the eight essential goods (rice, firewood, salt, oil, vegetables, meat, chicken, duck, and fish), regardless of the perpetrator's identity, may be under the jurisdiction of the Capital Commodity Price Stabilization and Discipline Committee for trial and sentencing.

Article 2: The Military Law Section of the Capital Commodity Price Stabilization and Discipline Committee, as the trial authority, may apply the Criminal Law of the Army, Navy, and Air Force, the Wartime Special Criminal Law, the Regulations for Punishing Corruption by Public Officials, the Criminal Law, and other laws for sentencing.

Article 3: Regarding the eight essential goods, anyone who impairs their supply and demand through violence, coercion, fraud, or other means, resulting in market shortages, even if not engaged in speculation, manipulation, or hoarding for profit, may be subject to a death sentence by special permission from the Chairman of the Military Affairs Commission under wartime military orders.

Article 4: Anyone who, with the intention of obtaining illegal profits, illegally levies donations, or uses power, violence, coercion, fraud, or other means to extort property from the people, whether or not they are public officials, shall be sentenced to death, life imprisonment, or imprisonment for ten years or more.

Article 5: The pronouncement of death sentences or imprisonment shall be carried out in accordance with legal procedures after approval has been obtained.

Article 6: These measures shall take effect from February 1, 1945.

### Draft Plan to Improve Railway Management

Nanjing, 6th (Central News Agency) – The Department of Roads and Administration of the Ministry of Construction, recognizing the increasing deterioration of railway transportation management, and in order to fulfill its supervisory responsibilities and protect the legitimate rights and interests of passengers, has instructed the Central China Railway Company to draft three proposals for improving the current state of railway management, as follows: (1) Suppress the black market trading of train tickets, (2) Crack down on the illegal activities of "black ticket touts," and (3) Prevent the loss of passengers' checked baggage, to be submitted to the Ministry for review. The Ministry is currently consulting with relevant parties on the above proposals. Yu Yizhao, Director of the Department of Roads and Administration, and Deputy Director Zhang, have made a special trip to Shanghai to inspect the actual conditions of stations in Shanghai and other places. It is reported that since the launch of the work to refresh station order, the rampant black market ticket trading has been somewhat suppressed. However, theft of passenger baggage still occurs from time to time. At the same time, some unscrupulous staff at the station take advantage of their positions to extort money before allowing passengers to verify their tickets and pass through. It is hoped that the authorities will pay attention to this and stop it as soon as possible.

### Major Western Offensive Imminent

Anglo-American Forces Gather in the Aachen Area

Berlin, 5th (Central News Agency) – German authorities announced on the 5th that anti-Axis forces are gathering troops east and north of Aachen, and have intensified shelling on the Saar defense line. This suggests that Eisenhower's large-scale offensive is imminent. The center of this offensive is roughly composed of the British Second and American Ninth Armies. Their operational goal is to invade Cologne and Düsseldorf, encircle the Rhineland industrial area, and then advance to the northern German plains. Geneva, 6th (Central News Agency) – A German-reported Paris dispatch states that the Supreme Headquarters of the Allied Expeditionary Force has announced that General Bradley has been reappointed as commander of the US First Army. Previously, when Bradley was transferred from commander of the First Army to commander of the US 12th Army Group stationed in France, the position of commander of the First Army was succeeded by General Hodges.

### Soviet Forces Reach the Warta River on the Kienitz Side; Berlin Resembles the Frontline, People Maintain Determination

Berlin, 6th (Central News Agency) – German authorities announced on the 5th that Sokolov's army, aiming for the small bend of the Warta River northwest of Küstrin, has reached the Warta River from both wings of Kienitz, which is 20 kilometers northwest of Küstrin. Kienitz is 50 kilometers from Berlin and is located on the west bank of the Warta River, currently the closest point to Berlin reached by Soviet forces. According to German authorities, it is still difficult to determine whether Soviet forces will further cross the Warta River and reach the west bank.

Berlin, 6th (Central News Agency) – The Führer's Headquarters announced at noon on the 6th that Konev's army has launched continuous major offensives from both wings of the Brzeg bridgehead, which is 40 kilometers southeast of Breslau on the west bank of the Warta River, and fierce fighting is currently underway.

Berlin, 6th (Haitong News Agency) – Local newspapers report that the German capital is now no different from the front line. Berlin will prove its historical mission. The German people do not think of surrendering, nor do they doubt the abilities of the German command. Their confidence in Führer Hitler is also unwavering.

### Police Bureau Chiefs Took Office Yesterday and Convened Their Subordinate Police Officers for Instruction

### Visiting Mr. Yen Hui-ching for Charity Sale to Support Education

— Bo Cun, Student of St. John's University

Having passed Lichun (Beginning of Spring), the unexpected severe cold this year is truly unbearable. Our group of four went to visit Mr. Yen around ten in the morning. Although the weather was particularly cold, our desire to see Mr. Yen was even more fervent. After entering the gate, we informed the attendant of our purpose. We are representatives of St. John's University and hope that Mr. Yen can help with the charity market we are organizing. The attendant went inside for a while and then came out, telling us that Mr. Yen was busy with affairs and had no time to meet us, and explained that he already knew about the charity sale and had even donated on his own initiative. In fact, it was expected that Mr. Yen would be busy and have no time, as he is dedicated to serving society. However, Mr. Yen's ability to still find time amidst his busy schedule to help with this charity sale is truly admirable.

However, our purpose was not limited to this. We also hoped that Mr. Yen could guide us with his rich experience and inaugurate the Fan Huang Du store of our school. Therefore, we troubled the attendant again to present a letter on our behalf. In less than a few minutes, the door to the inner room opened. Unexpectedly, we met an elderly man with a kind face and a dignified bearing. He walked into the room steadily, and we stood up respectfully to pay our respects. Mr. Yen spoke in a gentle voice, making us forget the cold of the day. Mr. Yen's concern made us forget the snubs we had encountered everywhere and felt a strange comfort, as if a prodigal son had returned home and saw his loving father, filling our hearts with emotion. After Mr. Yen learned of our purpose, he enthusiastically encouraged us. Finally, he stood up calmly, and we bid farewell and left. Upon exiting the gate, we were even more reminded of Mr. Yen's noble personality.

Charity Market Starts Fundraising

However, the items donated by various sectors are still insufficient. Recently, enthusiastic students have voluntarily launched a charity fundraising team, divided into small groups to go to various factories and stores to solicit donations, carrying letters of introduction and receipts bearing the names of the two newspapers and the Men's and Women's Youth Association, hoping that various factories and stores will generously help complete this charity. The donation status of various factories will be published in the two newspapers and major radio stations to ensure credibility and encourage others.

Donating New Year's Money to Help Students

Since the launch of this campaign, it has been warmly supported by people from all walks of life, with a continuous stream of people going to the company's gift certificate department, this newspaper's office, and Jinan Company to purchase them. However, there are only a few days left until the end of the lunar year, and it is hoped that all sectors will advocate and promote it to jointly support this charity.
