### Regarding the Purchase of Rice

—Yoshida Toyu

I live in an apartment with a panoramic view, where the rooftops of Shanghai are fully visible. Under the "Shanghai rooftops" that I see, everyone is talking animatedly, not about "sweet nothings," but about the price of rice. At the end of the undulating waves of Shanghai rooftops lies a vast and boundless plain. Now, on this plain, the main topic of discussion is also the price of rice. Although both the conversations under the rooftops and the discussions on the plain are about the price of rice, the content is completely different. The relationship between the city and the countryside is now clearly reflected in the rice issue. In peacetime, the city always provided the countryside with industrial products, and the countryside provided the city with rice. But what kind of industrial products is the city supplying the countryside today? If the countryside can receive the city's industrial products, it can naturally improve agricultural production efficiency and even produce food that sustains both the countryside and the city. However, today, the city gives the countryside nothing but "grand and majestic politics" that cannot fill the stomach or provide warmth. If it doesn't supply industrial products, how can it demand an improvement in agricultural production efficiency? If production efficiency cannot be improved, and even the lives of the farmers themselves are difficult to maintain, how can it expect them to sustain the city?

I believe that this is the fundamental problem that we should consider regarding the current "purchase of rice." If the current rice purchase price is not enough for farmers to cover the cost of purchasing industrial products (such as chemical fertilizers), how can the production efficiency of the rural economy be improved? As a result, the farmers themselves cannot even maintain their livelihoods, how can they have the surplus to sustain the lives of the city people? If unreasonable force is imposed on them, demanding what they cannot provide, then the farmers, despite their hard work from spring plowing to autumn harvest, will only be working for others, going hungry for the public, and unable to even survive. Therefore, they can only sigh at the fields and abandon farming to go elsewhere. If this continues, the dire consequences will be unimaginable. In terms of the principle of material exchange between the city and the countryside, it is necessary to pay attention to the above point in order to adjust the "rice purchase price" at the connecting center between urban and rural areas. Regarding this matter, I recently received a letter signed by 55 farmers from Qingpu County. I am publishing it here for the authorities to refer to. This is by no means artificial and affected groaning, but a symbol of the natural expression of the farmers' inner suffering. A more detailed original will be issued to the relevant government offices. I earnestly hope that the authorities will listen carefully to the cries of these farmers. (Translated by Jing)

To Mr. Yoshida: We, the farmers of our hometown, respectfully request the improvement of the rice requisition in order to alleviate the people's suffering and lay the foundation for the country. We are hereby submitting everything in writing (omitted). China is founded on agriculture, and farmers account for eight out of ten of the population. Therefore, stabilizing the livelihoods of the farmers is to stabilize the national livelihood. The Founding Father took "land to the tiller" as the foundation for governing the country. Today, the people's livelihood is withered, and not only can the tiller not have land, but even the tiller is unwilling to till the land. This affects the future of China and the future of East Asia, which is deeply worrying. If we want peace in East Asia and cooperation between China and Japan, we must first start with stabilizing the people's livelihood, and then we can devote all our efforts to helping in the war and securing the victory of East Asia. Recently, the farmers have suffered greatly in exchange for the meager rice revenue, and there is no way to appeal, causing great harm. Based on the survey results, we present our thoughts (omitted). The facts are as follows:

(1) Cost of Cultivation per Mu: (1) Seeds: approximately 600 yuan per mu (based on the rice price of 1,000 yuan in May of the 33rd year of the Republic, with 1 dou of grain equivalent to 6 sheng of rice). (2) Fertilizer: 3-4 bean cakes are needed per mu, approximately 1,000 yuan (based on 1 shi of rice being able to exchange for 3-4 bean cakes). (3) Labor: approximately 13-14 laborers are needed per mu, approximately 5,200 yuan (from May to October of the 33rd year of the Republic, the wage per laborer was from 200 to 600 yuan, averaging 400 yuan per laborer). (4) Food: calculated proportionally per laborer, approximately 5,200 yuan. (5) Other material depreciation costs, etc.: approximately 2,800 yuan per mu. (6) Taxes: approximately 200 yuan of taxes are paid per mu. Total cost per mu is 15,000 yuan.

(2) Production Volume per Mu: Fields vary in quality and fertility, and rice varies in type, so the harvest is also different: (1) Top-grade fields produce approximately 1.5 shi per mu. (2) Second-grade fields produce approximately 8-9 dou per mu. (3) Inferior fields produce approximately 2-3 dou per mu (belonging to low-lying and paddy fields).

(3) Rice Requisition Amount: (1) Last year, 6 dou were collected per mu, with an average of 4,000 dan per township. (2) This year, the regulation is to collect 1.6 shi per mu, with an average of 8,600 dan per township.

(4) Requisition Price: (1) Qingpu's fixed discount price is 3,800 yuan per shi (currently the price of sugar is also 4,000 yuan per shi). (2) Jinshan County has increased to 7,600 yuan per shi.

In summary, the cost per mu for farmers is 15,000 yuan, and the maximum harvest per mu is 1.5 shi. Now, the requisition amount is 1.6 shi per mu, and the discount price is only 3,800 yuan per shi. In this way, the farmers have no means of survival. We all hope that the requisition authorities will take into account the situation below and adjust the requisition amount and increase the purchase price (omitted), then the farmers, etc., will voluntarily pay it off as soon as possible (currently three-tenths have been collected, far from the fixed requisition amount). The farmers in our hometown will be deeply grateful (omitted below).

### Japanese Science Ranks Mobilize: Actively Manufacturing New Weapons; Sino-Japanese-Manchurian Agreement on Comprehensive Self-Sufficiency Plan

Tokyo, 24th (Central News Agency) In the current era of scientific warfare, in order to achieve final victory, the creation of new weapons has become a matter of great enthusiasm for the Japanese people. When Takeo Miki raised questions about this at the Budget Committee meeting of the House of Representatives on the 24th, Dr. Yagi, President of the Technology Institute, responded as follows: (1) The special attack units destroy the enemy with a spirit of certain death, and the Japanese scientific ranks are also working with a certain death spirit to manufacture new weapons, with great achievements. (2) Regarding the war-fighting of science, the necessary intellectual mobilization and scientific and technological mobilization, only the first mobilization has been carried out. There is still extremely rich intelligence that has not been war-fighted. This is Japan's greatest war fighting power and greatest weapon.

Tokyo, 24th (Central News Agency) Japanese Prime Minister Koiso, at the Budget Committee meeting of the House of Representatives on the morning of the 24th, answered the questions raised by Mr. Takeo Miki regarding the strengthening of the self-sufficiency system in the entire Sino-Japanese-Manchurian region as follows: Regarding the comprehensive self-sufficiency plan for China, Japan, and Manchuria, the Ministry of Agriculture and Commerce is currently cooperating with the Ministry of Munitions and the Ministry of Greater East Asia, and is in close contact and consultation with the authorities of China and Manchuria. Although there are many points of insufficient material quantities, we will strive to improve them through strong administrative measures in the future.

Tokyo, 23rd (Central News Agency) Japanese Minister of Greater East Asia Shigemitsu, at the Budget Committee meeting of the House of Representatives on the 23rd, answered the questions raised by Mr. Ko Tanaka regarding the transportation of materials in the continent, with the gist as follows: Regarding the purchase of materials in North China, in order to promote smooth cooperation between China and Japan, we are currently carefully considering the wartime inflation and rising prices, and studying improvement of the purchasing organization and methods. Regarding the transportation of resources from the continent, because there are certain restrictions, we are planning to carry out measures such as local war-fighting. As for the transportation of continental materials in North China and Manchuria, it is appropriate to transport them through the South Korean Railway to the extent possible. We have already started constructing a double-track railway within Korea, and we are working hard to improve the transportation facilities in the parts not completed in December of last year and in various parts of Korea.

### The 86th Session of the Japanese Diet Continues: Our Country's Government and Public Place Deep Expectations

Nanjing, 24th (Central News Agency) The 86th session of the Japanese Diet, after temporarily adjourning on December 27th of last year, resumed on the 21st of this month. At this time, when the Greater East Asia War has entered the final tense stage, the Japanese government and the Diet have formed a unified whole, which has profound and epoch-making significance and is worthy of attention. This Diet can truly be called the decisive battle Diet. On consecutive days, Prime Minister Koiso and other ministers, such as Foreign Minister Shigemitsu, delivered speeches on the Diet floor, elaborating on the Japanese government's decisive battle strategies and diplomatic policies to cope with this war stage. The 1 billion people of Greater East Asia have all attached great importance to the news and unanimously and enthusiastically expect that the government and public of our country will improve the purchasing mechanism and method.

### Remarkable Achievements of Japanese Shipyards

Tokyo, 24th (Central News Agency) The Japanese Shipbuilding Construction Headquarters has been strongly increasing the production of civilian oil tankers since October of last year. The construction achievements of the shipyards under its jurisdiction in Osaka, Kure, and Hyogo have progressed rapidly due to the enthusiasm and hard work of the workers, although the time is short. In general, 40% of the target has been achieved. In Osaka alone, the shipyards of Matsushita Daikai, Nanko, and other shipyards have completed the launching of ten ships and have decided to start transportation this month. Furthermore, the shipbuilding plan for the past year has already been completed by 80%, and the entire target quantity will be completed by the end of March.

Editorial

### A Sincere Announcement to Young Students

The plan for a day lies in the morning, the plan for a year lies in the spring, the plan for a lifetime lies in youth, and the plan for a country lies in the young students.

"The younger generation is to be regarded with respect; how can we know that those who come after us will not surpass us?" "If a man does not make himself heard of till forty or fifty, he will not be regarded with any respect," the meaning of this word "respect" is extremely important. The former contains boundless enthusiastic expectations, while the latter contains boundless desolate emotions.

The order or chaos of today's society and the prosperity or decline of the national destiny were long ago destined by the cultivation of young students twenty or thirty years ago, and the cultivation of today's young students again determines the order or chaos of society and the prosperity or decline of the national destiny in the next twenty or thirty years. Therefore, the school is the prototype of the country and society. Observing the inside story and the reality of today's schools, one can determine the rise and fall of the future society and country without divination and without ambiguity. The education of the imperial examination style creates a numb and indifferent atmosphere, and the education of the foreign joint-stock style creates the style of walking corpses. There are inevitable things, and there are inherent reasons.

The only natural duty of young students is of course nothing more than "studying." However, in order to emphasize the efficiency of "studying," attention should be paid to the method of studying. In order to emphasize the practical application of "studying," attention should also be paid to the cultivation of body and mind. Here, I provide an outline of these two points for the reference of my young students:

(1) Methods of Studying: Scholars of ancient and modern times have instructed us on many methods of studying. Broadly speaking, they can be divided into: (A) Horizontal aspect - when we are listening to lectures or self-studying, we must do our best to ensure that the mind, mouth, eyes, and hands are all in place, so as not to "think of swans coming at the same time" and scatter our spirit and blur our thoughts. Only then can we gain a minute of benefit from listening to a minute of class and see a minute of achievement from reading a quarter of an hour of books. If we can do this, then on a personal level, we will feel full of interest, enjoy it, and make rapid progress. At the same time, teachers will not have the suffering of "playing the lute to a cow" and will be full of energy. I dare not say that "the teacher is not strict and the student is lazy," but the interaction of mutual efforts is indeed undeniable, because the level and autonomy of young students are not comparable to those of young children. (B) Vertical aspect - the scope of knowledge is vast and boundless, and the essence of knowledge should not be superficial. Therefore, extensive learning, careful questioning, prudent thinking, clear discrimination, and resolute practice are the golden rules in the steps of studying. The reason why extensive learning begins and resolute practice ends is that the use of "knowledge" lies in "action." What is the value of "knowledge" without "action"? The "knowledge" gained through "action" is true "knowledge." This is why Mr. Yangming advocated the theory of the unity of knowledge and action and eradicated the habit of empty talk on paper. Among three men walking together, there must be one who can be my teacher. There is nothing in birds, beasts, insects, and fish that is not learning. As for the learning of managing the world and rectifying the times, we should especially collect it at any time with the spirit of extensive learning, and then add the organizational work of careful questioning, prudent thinking, and clear discrimination, so that it can be applied to practice according to the time and place.

(2) Cultivation of Body and Mind: Learning is a thing; body and mind are vessels. Without a sound vessel, how can things be contained? The sea can accommodate hundreds of rivers, so it can become great, and only by carrying a boat and pushing it forward can its use be shown. If the body and mind are not cultivated, there is no way to absorb knowledge, and the disadvantage is ignorance. As for the achievement of learning exceeding the cultivation of body and mind, it is like adding wings to a tiger to do evil and commit crimes, and the disadvantage is madness. It is like a mountain flood breaking out and rivers overflowing, with fields and villages submerged. As for the cultivation of body and mind, it should be valued in the training of youth, and the way to start it lies in self-control. Therefore, the main purpose of any religion is to first remove selfish desires, and then speak of sacrifice, and then speak of saving the world. The power is generated in restraint, the spring cannot produce movement if it is not wound tightly, and how can steam produce work if it is not controlled? The generator is water, and the water that scrapes and washes is also the book. The difference lies in whether it can be constrained as a judgment. In today's world of escalating human desires, how easy is it to talk about the cultivation of body and mind? We must first establish lofty ambitions, adopt a correct outlook on life, abandon all temporary gains and losses, abandon all personal happiness, take the big ego as the premise, and take the group as the object. Then we can talk about the integrity of not being moved by poverty and humbleness or subdued by power, then we can talk about the attainment of the cultivation of body and mind, and then we can talk about the subtlety of using learning.

At the beginning of the new year and the start of the new semester, I would like to encourage the young students in the country with the above two points. This newspaper has always attached importance to education, and in addition to expressing it in words, we also seek to promote it in reality. Taking the fundraising of student aid funds as an example, we cannot bear to sit idly by and watch the suffering of young people dropping out of school, and think of supporting the vitality of the country and the nation, and strive to make humble contributions. Although we have received support from all aspects, it is not without some achievements. However, considering the current situation, the high degree of poverty and the wide range of poverty, this small amount of student aid funds is not enough to help them study and they are still excluded from schools. Then, how many are there that we do not know? Therefore, those who can pay for admission, or get free admission, or get student aid funds and enter school are all children of heaven, rare and valuable, and at the same time, they should also know the greatness of the mission they bear and be more diligent and vigilant.

### Japan Has No Intention of Returning to the Gold Standard; Exchange Rates Will Not Change Either: Statement by Finance Minister Ishiwatari

Tokyo, 24th (Central News Agency) At the meeting of the House of Representatives Red Cross Committee on the 24th, Finance Minister Ishiwatari, in response to questions on whether the government had any intention of returning to the gold standard and whether the government had any intention of changing the currency exchange rate of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, said: "It is not easy to see the future use value of gold coins in the future currency at present, and whether gold coins can become an international currency cannot be decided by one party alone. We must consider the national conditions of the other party before we can decide. However, at present, not only Japan, but the whole world is also at war without gold. Even if the war ends, gold will not be very important, and it is difficult to predict whether the problem of war can be solved with gold. Japan has no intention of using gold as the standard for trade settlement within the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, but will replace it with organic settlement of goods and goods. As for the exchange rate of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, it must be changed accordingly, but the Japanese government has absolutely no intention of changing it at present."

### Agricultural Production Conference Opens in Beijing Yesterday: Units Report on Work Progress

Nanjing, 24th (Central News Agency dispatch) The Executive Yuan's Agricultural Production Promotion Committee, in order to review past work conditions, hear reports from various localities, and provide guidance for this year's work promotion direction, has specially convened a conference on agricultural production for various provinces and cities. The conference was held on the morning of the 24th at the Ministry of Industry in Beijing, attended by representatives from the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces, the Shanghai and Nanjing municipalities, the Promotion Committee, the Huaihai Provincial Government, cooperative representatives from various regions, county magistrates from experimental counties, representatives from cooperative branches, relevant central agencies, the Cooperative Affairs Committee of the Ministry of Industry, and representatives from the Rural Construction Implementation Committee, totaling more than 70 people. Chairman Chen of the committee personally presided over the meeting. The conference began at exactly 10:00 a.m. with customary formalities. Chairman Chen then delivered an opening speech, stating in brief:

"Today, we are holding the Agricultural Production Conference for various provinces and cities, and I am deeply grateful for the enthusiastic participation of representatives from various regions. At the start of the thirty-fourth year's production increase work, convening this conference is of great significance. Looking back at the overall situation of the thirty-third year's production increase work, the main goal was to lay the foundation for production increase work, while striving to increase the output of major crops such as rice, wheat, cotton, and hemp. Reviewing the situation of the past year, there have indeed been considerable achievements in some aspects, but overall, we cannot consider it entirely satisfactory. In brief, the main tasks of agricultural production increase last year included the organization of grassroots rural institutions and the training of technical personnel, the promotion of irrigation and drainage work, the improvement of rice cultivation techniques, the increase of cotton and hemp production, and the increase of livestock. In summary, the reason why the above major tasks did not achieve the expectation of comprehensive production increase was due to reasons such as the late initiation of the tasks, multiple changes of the responsible agencies, the incomplete completion of land clearing in various regions, and the lack of technical personnel. As the production increase work enters the beginning of its second year, we should deeply review the past, correct the shortcomings of the past, and strive to make future work more practical," and so on. Subsequently, Advisor Nasu delivered a speech of instruction, providing a detailed explanation of the training of technical talents in rural areas, with many words of encouragement. After the speech, the committee reported on past work conditions and explained and instructed on this year's work plan, which lasted until 12:00 noon. The meeting continued at 3:00 p.m. in the afternoon, with successive reports from various attending units, all of which were extremely detailed. It is scheduled that various important motions will be discussed starting at 10:00 a.m. today. The important reports of the committee and various units, as well as the discussion of various cases, will be released successively after the closing of the conference.

### Guatemala Severs Diplomatic Relations with Spain

Lisbon, 24th (Central News Agency dispatch) German News Agency reports: The government of Guatemala has severed diplomatic relations with Spain.

### Fierce Fighting in Western East Prussia: German Army Abandons Insterburg

Berlin, 24th (Central News Agency dispatch) German News Agency reports, military news: The powerful Soviet army in western East Prussia has advanced further north to between Mohrungen and Elbing, where fierce fighting has taken place. The German army in the eastern part of the province has disengaged from the enemy and retreated to the Masurian Lakes, and after fierce fighting, withdrew from Insterburg.

Berlin, 24th (Central News Agency dispatch) Huitong News Agency reports: The fighting on the southern border of East Prussia has eased slightly, while the fighting on the eastern border is extremely fierce. Allenstein and Soldau fell successively after fierce battles, but the German army has established a strong resistance at Friedland.

Strong Defense in Silesia

Berlin, 24th (Central News Agency dispatch) Huitong News Agency reports: Although the situation on the Eastern Front is still extremely critical, the German army's counterattacks on various sections of the entire line have gradually become effective. The reserve forces and people's assault teams that can be mobilized locally have all arrived at the front line to meet the enemy. However, it will take some time for the German army's strategic measures to be effective. The German army is fighting in the industrial area of Upper Silesia and the southern border of East Prussia, behind the vanguard of Soviet tanks. The fighting between Lodz and Kalisz is particularly moving. The defensive battle on the border of Upper Silesia was won, and the Soviet army only made some progress southeast of Krakow. Obstacles have now been built to the east and north of the industrial area. The Soviet army advancing northward to Płock north of the Vistula has reached Wocłaviavich. The German army is now putting up a strong resistance. The mechanized units and tank armies of the Soviet army that broke into the Hasek area north of Breslau east of Posen are now engaged in fierce fighting with the German army. The enemy troops attempting to attack Toruń and Bromberg from Breslau have all been repelled by the German army.

German Army Adopts Wise Strategy

Tokyo, 24th (Central News Agency dispatch) According to Berlin: The defense of the German army on the Eastern Front is gradually being strengthened, but the Soviet army on the western front of Warsaw is still advancing. In general, except for East Prussia, they have advanced to a line from Danzig in the north to the old Polish border and the Carpathian Mountains in the south. The Eastern Front commander of the German side is concurrently held by General Guderian, Chief of the Army General Staff, to make full preparations. However, immediately retreating rapidly after the Soviet army began to attack was unexpected by general military experts, but it cannot be said that this has not reflected the reality of the military strength of the two armies.

Comparison of Military Strength of Both Sides

In general, in a two-front war, one side must be sacrificed, no matter what. Currently, the German army's opponents have seventy divisions on the Western Front, and it is said that there are as many as 230 divisions engaged in a new frontal offensive north of the Carpathians on the Eastern Front. The German army undoubtedly also has a roughly equivalent force deployed. However, it is not easy to determine where the German army's focus of resistance lies based solely on the absolute number of its troops. Many knowledgeable people believe that it is nothing more than adopting the same strategy as in the First World War: defending in the east and attacking in the west. From the standpoint of the German authorities, it is a wise strategy to retreat quickly to avoid being surrounded and sacrificing needlessly. Therefore, although they suffered a major encirclement operation, the German army suffered very few losses.

### German Army on the Western Front Recaptures Over a Hundred Strongholds

Berlin, 24th (Central News Agency dispatch) Huitong News Agency reports: Since the collapse of the American front line in front of the Maginot Line the day before yesterday, the German army has successively recaptured over a hundred strongholds.

### Reorganizing Municipal Police Affairs: Strictly Prohibiting Police Extortion: Concurrent Director Zhou Calls Senior Police Officers for Instruction

Shanghai Special Municipality Police Bureau Concurrent Director Zhou, yesterday (24th) at 10:30 a.m., convened all deputy directors, section chiefs, deputy section chiefs, branch chiefs, deputy branch chiefs, police corps commanders, deputy police corps commanders, police security team commanders, deputy police security team commanders, water police corps commanders, and deputy corps commanders, etc., all levels of senior officers to issue instructions. Concurrent Director Zhou arrived on time with Deputy Directors Du and Ying and delivered instructions. The main points are as follows:

Resolved to Straighten Out Police Discipline

"This time I have taken office as Mayor and Concurrent Police Bureau Director, and I am determined to straighten out police affairs. The responsibility of the police is very heavy, especially in this time of war, it is necessary to maintain local security and adapt directly and indirectly to the wartime system, and cooperate with the total war effort. In addition to bearing this responsibility ourselves, we must also lead the public to participate in the total war effort. However, in order to achieve this goal, we must first be sound ourselves in order to gain public trust and obedience. Therefore, we should ask ourselves whether we have achieved soundness and whether we can gain public trust and obedience. In the past, there have often been illegal police officers who arbitrarily extorted money from the public on duty, even stopping and harassing small vendors carrying firewood and vegetables in the countryside, and only letting them go after receiving something. There have even been police officers who demand bribes whenever they inspect warehouses and goods, and all of these have been criticized by public opinion. If such dishonorable phenomena exist at the lower levels, the cadres should also feel ashamed. Therefore, in the future, we must pay close attention to straightening out discipline. The organization of this bureau is complex, and the personnel are merged from the old first, second, and third bureaus. Among them, there are those who have served in the former International Settlement or French Concession. Now that they have been merged and become a police bureau with complete unified police affairs, I hope that these personnel will abandon the previous settlement concepts. In the past, the settlement authorities were very contemptuous of the public, and Chinese police officers were merely employees. However, the current situation is no longer the same. Foreign police officers must know that they are now Chinese police officials and public servants of the government. Therefore, they must recognize their own responsibilities and demonstrate the spirit of the police. There are currently many Japanese personnel in this bureau. We should closely cooperate in the spirit of Chairman Wang Jingwei's 'sharing life and death,' and do our best in police work. If we can do our duty, we are loyal to the government. If the Chinese personnel of this bureau can do their duty, they are loyal to the Chinese government. If the Japanese personnel can do their duty, they are loyal to the Japanese government. I hope that all police officers will work hard in their respective positions, do their duty, and complete the police mission."

Improved Treatment to Begin Next Month

"However, while straightening out discipline, I am aware that police officers' treatment is meager. Therefore, it has been decided that starting from February 1st, police officers' treatment will be improved. The allocation of rice will be distributed free of charge from that time on, with each person receiving at least three dou. Salaries will also be increased appropriately. At the same time, the police consumer cooperative will be expanded, increasing its capital by 100 million yuan, and efforts will be made to strengthen purchasing and allocation work, and efforts will be made to allocate various daily necessities to stabilize the lives of the police. In the future, it is also planned to issue confidential funds or office expenses to deputy directors, deputy branch chiefs, deputy section chiefs, etc., to provide subsidies. Therefore, in the future, the police must absolutely not harass or extort money from the public. Otherwise, once verified, they will not be tolerated and will be severely punished. At the same time, there are rumors that there are patrolman companies in various branches. Such illegal organizations should be stopped immediately and must not exist again. The inspection office must strengthen supervision and inspection work, and report and investigate illegal police officers to become truly glorious police."

Adjusting the Structure to Increase Efficiency

"Secondly, starting from February 1st, this bureau will greatly improve its structure, simplifying it. The staffing and quotas should be unified, and the power should be concentrated in the branch chiefs. The directors should not issue orders to the section chiefs. The directors can guide and supervise the branch chiefs, but when orders are necessary, they should be issued in the name of the bureau director. However, with greater power comes greater responsibility for the branch chiefs. Therefore, I hope that all branch chiefs will lead by example and be a model for their subordinates. Currently, the transmission of official documents is very slow. A single document goes through many twists and turns, taking several days to complete. Such phenomena are not what a wartime organization should have. Therefore, work should be simple, clear, and agile. With a well-equipped structure, work efficiency can also be increased."

Concurrent Director Zhou finally mentioned that the practice of roadside police extorting money from the people has decreased during this period, greatly restoring the people's faith in the police. He hoped that this phenomenon would be maintained and further developed. The branch chiefs must fully explain to their subordinates after returning, so that every police officer and officer can understand their own duties and responsibilities. After Zhou's instructions were completed, a bureau affairs meeting was convened with the directors of each department to discuss the policy of promoting police affairs in great detail.

### Municipal Finance Authorities Actively Rectify Tax Revenue: Strictly Preventing Tax Evasion and Embezzlement

Since Secretary-General Luo concurrently took office as Director of the Shanghai Special Municipality Finance Bureau, he has made unremitting efforts to rectify the city's tax revenue, and is currently conducting separate studies and implementing meticulous policies to achieve the expected goals. Yesterday (24th), according to the person in charge of the bureau, the bureau recently decided on two important principles to be actively implemented: (1) Eliminate embezzlement and clarify accumulated malpractices. (2) Under the principle of not increasing the tax burden on the people, adjust the tax rates appropriately according to the actual situation. (3) Prevent taxpayers from illegally evading taxes. For example, the taxes paid by general hotels, theaters, amusement venues, restaurants, and other shops in the past were only one-tenth or one-twentieth of the amount that should have been paid. Some of this was embezzlement by collection staff, but most of the tax revenue was evaded by taxpayers through trickery. In the past, the government suffered more than 70% of such losses, and the amount was shocking. The bureau is currently determined to prevent this kind of tax evasion, and it is expected that illegal profiteers and corrupt officials will encounter a head-on blow.

### Propaganda Department Continues to Convene: Informal Talks with the Theater Community

Yesterday (24th) at 2:30 p.m., the Municipal Propaganda Department continued to convene more than 30 persons in charge of theater, opera, and variety shows in the city at the department's conference hall for informal talks. Director Liu first expounded that theater is a popular propaganda tool, which is crucial to the prosperity of national culture. Currently, the morale of the Shanghai people is depressed, and it is hoped that more plays that boost morale will be staged in the future to cooperate with wartime propaganda work. Then, he talked about the shortcomings of the Propaganda Department in the past, and decided to correct them in the future, and not allow bribery or extortion to occur again. He also hoped that all sectors would report any of the above situations as soon as they are discovered, otherwise, once verified, they will be treated as the same offense. Regarding all the work of the Propaganda Department in the future, it will be handled impartially and in accordance with laws and regulations. With the assistance of all sectors at any time, it will be fortunate for both public and private interests. It is reported that the theater community in the city greatly admires Director Liu's integrity and hard work.

Reader Scholarship News

### Scholarship Committee Decides: This Year's Student Scholarship Limit: Increased by One and a Half Times Compared to Last Year: Continued Fundraising for the Shortfall

The newspaper's Reader Scholarship Committee met yesterday to discuss the distribution of this year's scholarships. According to reports from various schools, tuition fees for the next semester will increase by about 200% to 400% compared to the previous semester, and the current donations are less than 22 million yuan, only an increase of 50% to 60% compared to the total amount of scholarships issued in the previous year, which was more than 14 million yuan. Therefore, the distribution of this year's scholarships is very difficult. It is not a good solution to greatly reduce the number of students, and giving each person too little scholarship is also useless. After repeated discussions, it was decided that the scholarship limit for students at all levels this year would be increased by 150% compared to the previous year, that is, 5,000 yuan per person for elementary school, 7,500 yuan per person for junior high school, 10,000 yuan per person for senior high school, and 15,000 yuan per person for university. It is estimated that there is still a shortfall of 10 million yuan in the current donations. However, most schools will start classes within a few days, so it was decided that in addition to elementary school students' scholarships being issued in one lump sum, the rest can only be issued in part first, estimated at 6,000 for junior high school, 7,500 for senior high school, and 10,000 for university. The remainder still needs to be raised continuously, and it is hoped that it can be issued by mid-March. As for existing students, they will continue to be subsidized, except for a few who voluntarily drop out of school and those whose grades are below standard.

Free Quotas Established in Colleges of Arts and Commerce

Furthermore, our college has stipulated that for this year's enrollment, 10 free students and 10 half-fee students will be admitted to the Chinese Literature Department and the Chinese Studies Specialization Course, and 5 free students and 5 half-fee students will be admitted to the Commerce Department and the Commerce Specialization Course for those recommended by your newspaper. We are sending you this letter for your review and ask that you include it in your publications."

### Public Utilities Bureau Staff Strictly Prohibited from Extortion

The newly appointed Director of the Public Utilities Bureau, Xu Jidun, recently told reporters that the vehicle registration offices under the bureau do not charge extra fees beyond the regulations for handling vehicle registration and licensing procedures. If the staff involved are found to be soliciting improper demands, they will be strictly investigated and punished. Mayor Zhou is determined to improve the treatment of municipal government staff, so those who handle affairs are not allowed to use livelihood as an excuse to solicit extra demands. However, on the citizens' side, whether registering or obtaining a license, they must follow the prescribed procedures, which can prevent the staff involved from taking the opportunity to solicit bribes and simplify the handling of procedures. Only with the cooperation of officials and the people, and each upholding the spirit of abiding by the law, can all malpractices be avoided.

In other news: The Municipal Public Utilities Bureau has recently made slight adjustments to the organization of the various vehicle registration offices for ease of management, dividing them into four grades: A, B, C, and D. The Grade A vehicle registration offices are: (1) Jiangning Road, (2) Changxing Road, (3) Gongping Road. The Grade B vehicle registration offices are: (1) West Shanghai, (2) South Shanghai, (3) Madang Road. The Grade C vehicle registration offices are: (1) Zhabei, (2) Pudong. The Grade D vehicle registration offices are: (1) Wusong, (2) Baoshan, (3) Minhang, (4) Nanhui, (5) Jiading, (6) Fengxian, (7) Chongming. The bureau will begin processing the exchange of bicycle licenses for the first half of the 34th year in this city starting today (25th). Each vehicle registration office has posted the license numbers and dates for each vehicle exchange, and it is hoped that each vehicle owner will go to exchange them on time to avoid congestion.

### Household Matches to be Sold Starting on the 28th

The second phase of household matches of the Soap and Candle Allocation Office of the Daily Necessities Control Committee will be allocated starting on the 28th. The scope of this allocation includes the first and second districts. Each person will be allocated one box of Hundred Deer Brand matches. The price per box, including donations, is 20 yuan in national currency. The committee is currently notifying retailers to pay and pick up the goods so that they can be distributed on time. (Also in the news) Regarding the previous allocation of household soap by the committee, because the list was based on the municipal government's list, there were slight discrepancies with the household registers of the Goods Allocation Office, resulting in a small number of residents not yet receiving the household soap in the previous period. The committee is currently consulting with the relevant authorities and will still find ways to provide supplementary supplies to the residents who have not yet received them.

### Shanghai Citizens' Welfare Association: Raising Donations for Winter Relief

In view of the fact that there are many extremely poor people among the citizens of Shanghai, and that assistance is especially necessary during this winter season, this association, after deliberation, decided to raise 50 million yuan to purchase miscellaneous grains for the purpose of selling them at fair prices. Subsequently, the Municipal Government established a Winter Relief Committee, and most of the members of this association participated in the work of the Winter Relief Committee. For example, Mr. Chen Riping, a director of this association, is the Deputy Director of the Winter Relief Committee. It was further decided, in order to save administrative expenses, to entrust the Winter Relief Committee to handle the matter. Furthermore, in order to expedite the process, the authorities of the Central Reserve Bank were first approached for assistance, borrowing 50 million yuan for the Winter Relief Committee to allocate. The Winter Relief Committee has already launched three temporary relief efforts (see yesterday's newspaper reports). However, the loan is stipulated to be repaid in three installments, with the first installment due on February 10th, which is fast approaching. The Board of Directors of this association has decided to entrust Xin Shen Bao and Shen Bao newspapers to publicly raise funds. We sincerely hope that wealthy and benevolent individuals in Shanghai will generously donate to help the poor. If you wish to donate, please send your donations directly to the social service departments of Xin Shen Bao and Shen Bao for collection on our behalf. The names of the donors and their titles will be successively published in both Xin Shen Bao and Shen Bao.

Short Commentary

### The Spirit of Thrift Worth Emulating

Yesterday, we heard that Mr. Wen Lanting's grandson was married, and the wedding was thrifty and simple, with several commendable features: (1) No announcement was made in the newspapers beforehand. (2) Gifts were limited to no more than 400 yuan. (3) The wedding took place at 8:30 a.m. Mr. Wen presided over the wedding ceremony, and at 9:00 a.m. he went to work as usual. (4) No public hall was rented; instead, an extremely simple hall was set up in the family home. (5) The furniture in the bridal chamber was all old. (6) No wedding banquet or refreshments were prepared.

Mr. Wen Lanting is a well-known figure in Shanghai and has a wide circle of acquaintances. Although the wedding was not announced in the newspapers, many people still sent gifts. It seemed inhumane to refuse them, so a limit of no more than 400 yuan was imposed. This thorough method of thrift and practical example of leading by example truly embodies wartime living.

On the one hand, we admire Mr. Wen's spirit of practicing what he preaches; on the other hand, we hope that the general public will emulate this spirit, so that a thorough spirit of thrift will be formed in society.
