### Heavy Fighting on All Fronts in Balikpapan: Japanese Secure Deep Positions and Fiercely Shell Concentrated Enemy Forces on the Coast

Southern Front Base, 11th (Central News Agency Dispatch): In the fighting around Balikpapan, which has been ongoing since the 8th, both sides have made full contact along the 29-kilometer coastline from the city streets to the first airfield. The fighting is particularly intense around the first airfield. Japanese forces, through their attacks, have inflicted heavy casualties on the enemy. Currently, Japanese forces are maintaining their deep positions and are concentrating artillery fire on enemy troops gathered in the narrow coastal areas, inflicting significant damage.

Southern Front Base, 11th (Central News Agency Dispatch): In the fierce battles raging around Balikpapan, the bodies of enemy soldiers are strewn across the front lines thanks to the brave fighting of the Japanese garrison. Since the 4th, a unit commanded by Lieutenant Fujimoto has fiercely shelled an enemy battle group attacking the second airfield, instantly destroying three enemy tanks and repelling the enemy. A unit commanded by Lieutenant Toya destroyed an enemy observation post with heavy artillery fire, gradually silencing enemy shelling. Another unit, positioned in a special location, defended against hundreds of enemy soldiers with a small number of troops, fighting bravely for 14 hours, inflicting heavy casualties on the enemy, and repelling them. The Japanese air defense forces bravely engaged enemy aircraft, including over a dozen fighters and bombers, which have repeatedly bombed and strafed Japanese positions daily. As of the 4th, a unit commanded by Lieutenant Taka has achieved the following results: shooting down three B24s, four P38s, and one B25; damaging three B24s, three P38s, and one fighter, totaling over fifteen enemy aircraft shot down or damaged.

### Japanese Special Attack Units Launch Daring Attacks: Aerial Warfare Expected to Intensify

Forward Airbase, 11th (Central News Agency Dispatch): In the Battle of Okinawa, the Japanese military's daring special attacks not only thwarted the enemy's plans to invade the Japanese mainland but also significantly impacted the progress of future operations. Currently, the enemy is actively preparing the base groups in Okinawa, placing greater emphasis on the maintenance of small- and medium-sized aircraft for tactical use. The Japanese military's special attacks will become more advantageous as the adverse weather moves northward. The bases across Kyushu and the Japanese mainland are being strengthened. Therefore, the war situation will favor the Japanese military. For example, a certain special attack base, despite being attacked by dozens of enemy aircraft and hit in several locations, still managed to launch special attack aircraft one after another amidst the lingering smoke. No matter how much the enemy bombs, the spirit of the special attacks remains undeterred and courageous. The enemy is desperately trying to suppress the special attack bases, while the Japanese military is bravely fighting back, with Japanese aircraft launching fierce attacks on enemy bases in the Okinawa area. Consequently, aerial warfare between the two forces is bound to intensify. It is reported that the U.S. military mobilized over 20,000 aircraft in the European theater. When they deploy to the Japanese mainland, the number of aircraft will naturally be limited. Meanwhile, after relocating to underground facilities, Japan's aircraft factories have been sending special attack aircraft to the front lines. These planes are now soaring over bases in Kyushu and thousands of kilometers into mainland China. The existence of these Japanese special attack aircraft will inevitably plunge the enemy's invasion of the mainland into a bloody quagmire.

### Attacks on Kanto by Carrier-Based Aircraft: Twenty-Six Planes Shot Down

Tokyo, 11th (Central News Agency Dispatch): A group of carrier-based aircraft dispatched by the U.S. Third Fleet, commanded by Admiral Halsey, carried out wave-like attacks on the Kanto region of Japan from a little after 5:00 AM to around 5:00 PM on the 10th. Their main objective was to attack Japanese airfields. The enemy aircraft came in successive waves, totaling approximately 1,300. The Japanese military skillfully countered, achieving success and sustaining very minor damage. There was no damage to aircraft or airfield facilities. Furthermore, the Japanese military achieved a victory of shooting down twenty-six enemy aircraft. After the attack on the 10th, the enemy's mobile fleet, deeply fearing Japanese special attacks, appears to have retreated. No carrier-based aircraft attacked on the morning of the 11th, but their mobile fleet seems to still be cruising near the Japanese mainland.

P61 Aircraft Deployed to Okinawa

Forward Aviation Base, 11th (Central News Agency Dispatch): The enemy fighters and bombers currently deployed on the Okinawa front include various types. It has recently been discovered that the P61 night fighter has also been deployed to Ie Shima. It is reported that the P61 is a night fighter and ground attack aircraft with twin engines and twin fuselages. It is over 21 meters long, over 15 meters in fuselage length, has a crew of three, is armed with five 20mm cannons, and has a maximum speed of 650 kilometers per hour.

### Japanese Cabinet Passes Food Countermeasures

Tokyo, 11th (Central News Agency Dispatch): In preparation for an enemy invasion of the mainland, the Japanese government is gradually implementing decisive war measures. On the 10th, the Cabinet passed the "Food Countermeasures for Domestic Battlefields," which the Information Bureau announced the gist of on the 11th.

### Kawai Anti-Aircraft Artillery Unit Awarded Commendation by Japanese Army Ministry: Total of 412 Enemy Aircraft Shot Down

Tokyo, 11th (Central News Agency Dispatch): The anti-aircraft artillery unit led by Major General Kawai of the Japanese Army has achieved remarkable results since January 19, when B29s from the Mariana base launched large-scale attacks on the key areas of Osaka and Kobe, during successive air raids. On the nights of March 13th and 16th, despite the adverse weather conditions, they overcame the difficulties and achieved a total of 142 enemy aircraft shot down or damaged. Subsequently, on June 1st and 5th, when enemy aircraft launched a large-scale attack on the Osaka-Kobe area, the officers and soldiers of the unit further demonstrated their strength, shooting down 36 of the approximately 450 enemy aircraft. According to an announcement by the Army Ministry on the 11th: The Kawai Anti-Aircraft Artillery Unit is fulfilling its great mission of protecting the Imperial Land and is a model for soldiers. Therefore, it is awarded a commendation and reported to the Emperor.

### Manchukuo Ambassador Li Elaborates on Determination for War

Nanjing, 11th (Central News Agency Dispatch): Li Shaogeng, the Ambassador of Manchukuo to China, met with Chinese and Japanese reporters at the embassy at 3:30 PM on the 11th. He gave a brief report on the general situation in Manchukuo and elaborated on Manchukuo's determination and belief in the Greater East Asia War. The main points were as follows: The European war has now ended. Judging from the Atlantic Charter declared by the United Kingdom and the United States, and the San Francisco Conference held this time, the enemy side is boasting about safeguarding the independence and survival of all nations. However, analyzing the harsh conditions imposed by the United Kingdom and the United States on the defeated country of Germany, it can be seen that might can defeat justice. In order to fight for independence and survival, we must be united in hatred against the enemy. The three countries of China, Japan, and Manchukuo have already stated that for the co-existence and co-prosperity of Greater East Asia, they have the determination to fight. The people of Manchukuo are showing vigorous progress in strengthening their war effort. In terms of military supplies production, due to the establishment of a self-sufficiency system for weapons, the production capacity of weapons has been improved and strengthened, and we are actively moving towards enriching our war effort. Regarding agricultural production measures, we regard it as a key focus. This year, we are working towards the major goal of increasing production by 10% for general farming households and 50% for development groups, and everything is progressing smoothly, and we will be able to obtain a bountiful harvest as expected. As for the matter of national industrious service, the "National Labor Department," which is the highest-level organization responsible for production guidance and management, was established in the spring, and student mobilization teams and official labor volunteer teams were organized, contributing greatly to both war effort enhancement and national defense construction. Regarding local administration, in order to strengthen and adjust its comprehensive network, "Special Measures for the Current Situation" were announced. As a result, the function of regional defense is becoming healthier. Due to the consistent implementation of controlled economy and the allocation of essential goods, the lives of the people are very stable. The people fully trust and cooperate with the government's policies. On May 2nd of the year before last, my Premier Zhang Guo, with the qualification of special envoy to Japan, visited Japan, and as a result, the opinions on the strategy of Japan and Manchukuo working together to carry out the war were completely consistent. It can be seen that the friendly relations between Japan and Manchukuo are entirely based on a moral standpoint, which cannot be compared to the deceit and mutual exploitation of the countries participating in the San Francisco Conference. Therefore, the glorious preservation of China, Japan, and Manchukuo is sufficient to lay the foundation for the joint victory in the Greater East Asia War. At the same time, it can awaken the common destiny of East Asia for all countries and regions in Greater East Asia, and gather total strength to make the enemy withdraw from the territory of East Asia.

### Guangdong Governor Chu Announces Policy Guidelines: Focusing on Building Stability and People's Livelihood

Guangzhou, 11th (Central News Agency Dispatch): Chu Minyi, the newly appointed Governor of Guangdong Province and concurrently Director of the Pacification Headquarters, held an inauguration ceremony at the provincial government auditorium at 9:00 AM on the 9th. Dozens of heads of various agencies in the provincial capital attended, and Central Committee member Chen acted as the representative of the central authorities to supervise the oath. After taking office, Governor Chu met with Chinese and foreign reporters in the city at 10:00 AM and delivered a speech to the people of the province, the main points of which are as follows: Guangdong is the source of the revolution and has a great and glorious position in history. We already know the history of China's love of revolution, the Three Principles of the People of the Father of the Nation, and Mr. Wang's peace-saving movement, so we should love Guangdong even more. Since the incident, Guangdong Province has been in a remote location, and its economic situation, social environment, and transportation situation are extremely complex. In order to adapt to these, we must make twice the effort. I have come to Guangdong this time and will spare no sacrifice, avoid no difficulties, and fear no dangers in order to engage in the work of loving and protecting Guangdong. I can point to the heavens and the sun to prove this. As for the grand plan to govern Guangdong, I will take the original intention of loving and protecting Guangdong Province as the goal of my administration and adapt to the current needs of Guangdong Province as the guideline of my administration. The meaning of love and protection is not just one way. In terms of society, we only allow construction and do not allow destruction. In terms of people's livelihood, we allow stability and do not allow shaking. In terms of the economy, we allow adjustment and do not allow speculation. In terms of the market, we allow   , and do not allow disturbance. In terms of the countryside, we allow cultivation and do not allow exploitation. In addition, matters such as education, culture, customs, military police, and industry and commerce should be strengthened with discipline, and no meaningless expansion should be made. In short, preventing all destruction is equivalent to strengthening one point of vitality. As for the word "adaptation," in simple terms, it means satisfying all just demands and promoting one point of normal progress, sharing joys and sorrows with the people. All of the above are the duties that I should bear in the course of loving and protecting Guangdong. I hope that all the people of the province will use this to encourage themselves and to correct my shortcomings.

Editorial

### The Chongqing-Yan'an Problem and the Political Council

The last session of the National Political Council in Chongqing opened on July 7th. After this session, according to the decision of the Sixth National Congress of the Kuomintang in Chongqing, the National Assembly will be convened on November 12th to deliberate and pass the constitution, etc., and implement the constitutional government of "returning power to the people." However, this decision by the Chongqing Kuomintang was first met with a counterattack from the CCP. The latter criticized the Chongqing decision as merely a superficial exercise and announced that it would refuse to participate in this session of the Political Council and the National Assembly to be held under the leadership of Chongqing. At the same time, the Third Force felt quite anxious about the Chongqing authorities. In order to take into full account international attention, they had to seek to create a superficially satisfactory phenomenon for this last session of the Political Council, and had to treat the CCP and the Third Force with some pretense of courtesy. The visit to Yan'an by the neutral party Huang Yanpei and six others was motivated by this.

In recent years, the Chongqing-CCP problem, which has become blatant on the occasion of the issue of attendance at the Political Council, is almost a recurring drama every year. In the meantime, it is inevitable that the Third Force will be invited to mediate and lobby, but the result often becomes an inconclusive situation. The opposition between Chongqing and the CCP becomes even deeper, and the Third Force simply sighs in vain, publishing some tearful articles urging the Chongqing and CCP parties to put the overall situation of the country first, abandon prejudices and personal plots, and unite in cooperation, etc., which is nothing more than a set of old tunes.

However, this time the situation is clearly more serious. First, since Chongqing is preparing to implement constitutional government, while the country is still facing such opposition and friction, it leaves a very bad impression on the international community. Second, after the end of the European war, the East Asian problem has been brought to the forefront, and Chongqing urgently needs the United Nations to strengthen its assistance as a whole, while the United Nations takes the internal unity and solidarity of China as a prerequisite. The   of the Chongqing-CCP problem has made Chongqing anxious. Third, this time, Song Ziwen went to the Soviet Union, taking a large number of people with him, in an attempt to make comprehensive contact with the Far East problem and then participate in the Three  conference. Therefore, the superficial reconciliation of the Chongqing-CCP problem is particularly urgent. The mission of the neutral party Huang Yanpei and others in the north is different from the previous two chapters of negotiations with the CCP.

In the neutral faction, that is, the Third Force, before the incident in 1937, mediating the conflict between the Kuomintang and the CCP did have a significant effect. However, after the incident, the Third Force also lost its value due to the temporary easing of the conflict between the Kuomintang and the CCP. A section of leaders could not play much of a role in the Political Council either. Until the Anhui Incident in the spring of 1941, the conflict between the Kuomintang and the CCP became serious again. Thus, the so-called Third Force, centered on Huang Yanpei, Zhang Junmai, Zuo Shunsheng, etc., attracted attention from all sides due to mediating the dispute between Chongqing and the CCP, and soon the "Democratic League of Political Groups" was established, forming a formal Third Force. Now, they are happily going north, and besides the task of mediation, they naturally have even greater ideals.

The inability to ease the relationship between Chongqing and the CCP, at a time when the relative strengths of Chongqing and the CCP are beginning to reverse, cannot be fundamentally resolved. Not only can we understand this, but the Third Force in Chongqing has not completely failed to see it either. However, their resolute assumption of the responsibility of mediation, in terms of the appeal to the hearts of the people across the country and the respect of Chongqing and the CCP for them, is enough to enhance their status, which is also conceivable. The warm welcome that Yan'an gave to Mr. Huang Yanpei proves this, but to say that the Third Force has the power to influence national politics again is not only premature but also does not conform to the facts.

Under this deadlock, although the National Political Council in Chongqing is held as usual, it is not surprising that it is bleak and lackluster.

### Wu Huawen Visits Bengbu

Bengbu, 11th (Central News Agency Dispatch): General Wu Huawen, Commander-in-Chief of the Third Route Army, recently transferred his Route Army to this province. Yesterday, he led his senior generals to Bengbu by military train. Governor Lin and concurrently Pacification Director, as well as heads of various departments and bureaus, representatives of various people's organizations in the provincial capital, students, and heads of various Allied agencies, totaling more than a thousand people, went to the station to welcome him. After General Wu got off the train, he went to the Pacification Headquarters by car to pay a visit to Director Lin, followed by visits to various Allied agencies. Subsequently, Governor Lin hosted a banquet. In addition, the headquarters of the Route Army published a "Letter to the People of Anhui Province," expounding the revolutionary army's stance of not disturbing the people, truly loving the people, and vowing to save the country. It also hopes that the elders of this province will deeply understand the rampant bandits and communists. For the sake of the country and the people, military and civilians must cooperate, strictly prevent communism, and actively suppress communism, and express that in the future, under the guidance of Director Lin, they will work together with the government to eliminate bandits and communists and move towards the path of revitalizing China and protecting Asia.

The department has now joined forces with the Xuzhou Municipal Government to organize a summer labor service training camp, which is scheduled to recruit 500 middle school students who have not yet entered factories and senior primary school students. The camp site is planned to be at the Municipal Girls' Middle School. Military supplies manufactured by various factories that belong to the light industry and manual labor sectors will be sent to the training camp for production. The factory side will also send personnel to guide the work. Currently, more than 400 people have registered, and it is scheduled to begin on the 15th.

### Tentative Proposals for Developing West Dongting Mountain

— Xu Huimin

Since the Shanghai community's Jiangsu Province sightseeing delegation, including Mr. Yuan Ludeng, Xiang Kangyuan, and Chen Riping, went to West Dongting Mountain for inspection, intending to use it as a basis for population dispersal, West Mountain has increasingly attracted public attention. The Jiangsu Provincial Governor and Sun Jianshe, the head, also have a plan to open it as a model autonomous region. Therefore, I express my humble opinion as a small contribution.

West Mountain is my hometown, located in Wu County, a lone island in Taihu Lake, surrounded by water on all sides, with unrestrained mountains and waters and a vast area. It is adjacent to East Mountain in the east, Huzhou, Zhejiang in the south, Wuxi in the west, and Guangfu in the north. The land area includes: 8985.209 acres of rice paddies, 20027.146 acres of land, 42617.483 acres of mountains, and 3874.383 acres of swamps, totaling 75504.221 acres. Residents engaged in agriculture account for 65%, industry 20%, commerce 10%, and other party affairs, politics, medicine 5%. The entire area is established as a district under the jurisdiction of Wu County, the 13th district, with a district office. The Baojia system is divided into two towns and eight townships, 74 Bao, and 761 Jia. The scenery is as beautiful as Suzhou and Hangzhou, and it is rich in resources, including coal, manganese, magnetic soil, and limestone. The fruits include loquats, bayberries, ginkgo, and chestnuts. The special product is Dongting Biluochun, the best green tea, benefiting from the mountain's clouds and mist, with a clear and crisp taste, famous far and wide. Wool is also a special product of this mountain, with a soft and resilient quality, most suitable for weaving woolen products. Unfortunately, education is underdeveloped, the people are ignorant, generally worship superstition, rigidly adhere to old methods, and do not know how to research and improve. Local administration was once controlled by those addicted to smoking and gambling, resulting in exorbitant taxes, local poverty, and the people's livelihood becoming increasingly difficult.

Establishing Security

After the incidents in West Mountain, lake bandits often appeared, causing slight disturbances in the area. However, distant rumors are often exaggerated, easily increasing people's fear, causing some to hesitate to go there, which is regrettable. Now, the provincial government is paying particular attention to the issue of security. In addition to instructing the villagers of Jinshan Township to organize a hundred-man guard group to strengthen their self-defense force, it has also ordered the county government to expand the strength of the county security team to send detachments to the mountain to increase defense. In the future, the security guarantee of West Mountain will become increasingly solid. Not only will the people be able to live and work in peace, but entrepreneurs, if they can consider the nation and the people, and invest in developing the resources of the mountain, can also have no worries.

The terrain of West Mountain is surrounded by water on all sides, so consolidating permanent local security is especially important for defending against water bandits. Select the strategic passes on the lake shore of the mountain, such as Ershan Mouth in the east, Shigong Mouth in the south, Ya Mouth in the west, and D渡船 Mouth in the north, to build solid bunkers and fire platforms, and station self-defense groups or security teams. Other small ports and rivers, without important transportation connections, should be completely blocked and sealed off. At the same time, local undesirable elements should be cleared, then the security of the entire area will be established, and various construction projects will be easier to advance rapidly.

Increasing Food Production

The entire West Mountain area has only 8985.209 acres of rice paddies. The average yield per acre is estimated at two shi of rice, with an annual output of 17970.48 shi, which can only supply the original residents with food for a little over two months. Therefore, West Mountain's food has always been procured from Suzhou, Wuxi, Zhejiang, and Huzhou to make adjustments. Therefore, to solve the food problem, both temporary and fundamental solutions are needed. For temporary measures, please ask the government authorities to facilitate the sourcing of supplies, allowing West Mountain merchants to purchase food from Suzhou, Xiangshan, Wuxi, Yixing, Zhejiang, and Huzhou. To prevent merchants from manipulating prices, establish two cooperatives for purchasing and selling at fair prices. The fundamental solution is to increase food production. Reclaim and fill the entire area of 3874.383 acres of swamps and the wasteland along the lake to create fields. Then, cultivate the public and private barren mountain land, sow early rice and miscellaneous grains, such as beans and wheat, then the West Mountain food problem can be solved.

Developing Mineral Resources

West Mountain is rich in mineral resources. Tianwangwu, Macheng Palace, Shenjiachang in Donghe Town, Nanxu Meitiantou, Yangjiachang, Xiaoxiapu, Hanzhi, and Qilishan all have abundant coal resources. Before the incident, the Da Wangwu Coal Mine was approved by the Ministry of Industry for mining under the name of Chengjin Coal Mine Company, owned by the mill owner Luo Gan, and jointly operated with Limin Company due to capital relations, with a contract to produce about 40 tons of coal per day, which was transported and sold to various places, and the coal quality was good. After the incident, it went through several changes, first jointly operated by Chengjin and Dharma Foreign Firm, then jointly operated by Chengjin and Fenglong Foreign Firm, and now it is solely mined by Shicheng Coal Mine Company. Shenjiachang Coal Mine was also a Chengjin mining area before the incident. After the incident, due to various changes, it is now mined by Baoshan Coal Mine Company, with a daily output of about 50 tons of coal. Other coal mines have not yet been developed. The Du渡口 of Qianwan Township produces white clay, Yuanshan of Lucun Township produces red mud and large mud, and Jiaoli of Litang Township produces . Other mountains produce glass stone or limestone, namely Qingshi, which can be used as raw materials for pottery or cement. It is hoped that Shanghai entrepreneurs will invest in mining during this time of population dispersal, assist the government, and build a new West Mountain.

Establishing Factories

West Mountain has many raw materials for industry. If small factories can be established, the costs will be lighter than in the city, and the livelihoods of dispersed refugees can be solved, which is a win-win situation. The factories that should be established are described as follows:

(A) Canned Food Factory — West Mountain produces a wide variety of fruits, including loquats, bayberries, chestnuts, dates, persimmons, pomegranates, grapes, oranges, peaches, plums, apricots, cherries, etc. Unfortunately, the local farmers stick to old methods and do not know how to research and improve, so the excellent products cannot be stored for a long time or transported and sold throughout the country and overseas. If a canned food factory is established for processing and packaging, they can be preserved for a long time. Other aquatic products include carp, crucian carp, , , , , shrimp, , etc. Due to its location on Taihu Lake, production is abundant. There are also silver fish, white fish, and , , and vegetables produced in the lake and swamp, which are even more famous and can be used to set up factories to manufacture canned food.

(B) Woolen Fabric Manufacturing Factory — Nine out of ten residents of West Mountain raise pigs and sheep, so wool is also a major product, with a soft and resilient quality. Merchants have long stationed on the mountain to collect and sell it overseas, and then weave woolen products to be transported back to China for sale, with profits flowing outward, which is immeasurable! If a factory can be established in the production area to manufacture woolen products, it can reduce costs and wages and recover profits.

(C) Flour Mill — Wheat has also been a major product of West Mountain in recent years. Most residents make flour by earthen methods to supplement their food supply. Some farmers use it as pig feed, which is a pity! It is hoped that Shanghai capitalists will invest in establishing small flour mills. Not only will the costs and wages be lower than in the city, but it can also alleviate the local food shortage.

(D) Silk Factory — West Mountain residents, large and small, all raise silkworms, which has become a common side business throughout the area. In the spring and autumn seasons, fresh cocoons are abundant. At the peak, about 10,000 dan can be collected. In other neighboring areas such as Guangfu, Xiangshan, and East Mountain, silkworm rearing is also a major product. If small silk factories are established to manufacture factory silk, the costs and wages will be lower than in Shanghai.

(E) Paper Mill — West Mountain also has considerable production of raw materials for papermaking, such as mulberry bark, reeds, and bamboo. If it is not enough, it can be purchased from Changxing in nearby Zhejiang Province.

Popularizing Education

West Mountain is isolated in Taihu Lake, surrounded by water, so transportation depends on steamships and sailing ships. Currently, there are two steamships running between Suzhou and West Mountain, one is the Shanbei Wheel of Dingsheng Company and the other is the Yuanyushu of Lixing Company, making one round trip each day, but they are suspended during typhoons. There are only sailing ships to and from 州, Wuxi, Changxing, Guangfu, Xiangshan, etc., and they are not scheduled. There is one ferry to and from East Mountain every day. Land transportation is by rickshaw. However, because the mountain roads are rugged and uneven, only the southeast corner is passable. The northwest side is undulating, making it inconvenient for vehicles, so sedan chairs are used. The current transportation situation in West Mountain is as described above, so to build a new West Mountain, transportation must be expanded to make it convenient. Here is a brief description:

Sea Routes: (A) Su Shan Route: At least two steamships should travel between Suzhou and West Mountain every day, passing through Hengtang, Dongkuatang, Xikuatang, Mudu, and Xukou. (B) Hu Shan Route: Prepare one steamship for round trip every other day. (C) Xi Shan Route: Prepare one steamship for round trip between Wuxi and West Mountain every other day. (D) Che Shan Route: Prepare two ferries for two round trips per day.

Postal Service: West Mountain originally had a third-class post office before the incident, which was under the jurisdiction of the Mudu Post Office. After the incident, it was changed to an agency, so it is urgent to restore the third-class post office to facilitate people's postal services.

Telegram: West Mountain does not yet have telegram or telephone installations. However, to facilitate the circulation of news, it is planned to install a radio telephone and a long-distance telephone in each township.

The people of West Mountain are ignorant and education is underdeveloped, so compulsory education should be implemented. Establish adult literacy schools and notify township heads and Baojia chiefs to send illiterate residents aged 16 to 40 to the school. Tuition fees are waived, and the time is set from 7:00 to 9:00 AM and from 1:00 to 3:00 PM to avoid interfering with working hours. Reorganize the existing private schools in each township into "Wu County 13th District XX Town Standing No. × Elementary School", eliminate unqualified teachers from the original schools, and retain the excellent ones. Establish at least one school in each township. If there are many children enrolled or the township boundaries are remote, two schools can be established. However, the school site must be selected at the central point of each township to avoid students traveling too far, arriving late, and their studies being affected. The establishment of vocational high schools must be based on the needs of the local environment and then raise funds and find suitable school sites to prepare for implementation. Establish a library.

Establishing a Hospital

Before the incident, West Mountain had a "West Mountain Epidemic Hospital" established by the Shanghai Zhishe Legal Association West Mountain Branch organized by Mr. Wang Yishi and others from Shanghai, with excellent results, benefiting the poor and sick immensely. It was closed after the incident, and no hospital has been established since then. Only the Western doctor Lu Shiyuan from the hospital was retained by local people and practiced medicine with a license. There are also Buddhist monks Feng and Shang, doctors of traditional Chinese medicine Wang Shiyun and Xu Xiaoshi, who specialize in typhoid fever and internal medicine for women. World doctors Qin Tuyuan, Wenyuan, brothers, specialize in typhoid fever and internal medicine, and surgeons Jin Zhongkang and Fan Zikang. However, because medicines and consultation fees are expensive, residents are unable to afford medical treatment. It is hoped that the authorities responsible for the evacuation will quickly join forces to establish a hospital in West Mountain to save the poor and sick.

Constructing New Villages

The rural organization of West Mountain is extremely scattered. To concentrate forces and facilitate construction, construct new villages or new market towns in safe and suitable locations as a model for construction. (A) From Houbao Port to Houbao Street in Qixian Township, a new market can be built. (B) From Shuode Bridge (commonly known as D渡馬 Bridge) in Donghe Town to Macheng Palace, a new village or market town can be built. (C) From Zhendu Bridge to Shuangta Village in Zhenxia Township, a new market town can be built. (D) From Shuangta Village to Baoshanwu, a new village can be built as a safe residential area. It is hoped that Shanghai construction companies with capital will invest in development.

### Solicitation Methods for Scholarship Funds - Expectations for Alumni

All recipients of the newspaper's scholarship fund must have a common belief, which is "Since I have received from society, how shall I repay society?" In a broad sense, this repayment naturally lies in "Doing my best, using what I have learned, to serve society and serve the country." In a narrow sense, it should be recalled that "When I was studying, I was burdened by my family's financial situation. I was cultivated by society, and then I was able to graduate. After graduation, I am able to support myself. I should save money, donate to scholarship funds, and solicit donations from enthusiastic relatives and friends. It is only right to remember the source of the water one drinks."

According to the newspaper's past scholarship recipients, in addition to graduates from senior and junior high schools, there are at least 300 graduates from universities and vocational schools. Some of them work in the city, and some work in other places. In terms of academic disciplines, there are those in science, engineering, chemistry, electricity, commerce, agriculture, and textiles. Although the employment situation has not been precisely counted, it is expected that they are all thriving. Now is the time for everyone to work hard and contribute a little to scholarship work, so that thousands of poor students can receive your grace. With this "metabolic" continuation, the scholarship movement can continue forever!

Two ambulances are also equipped for pick-up and drop-off at any time. Anyone suffering from acute gastroenteritis or other timely epidemic symptoms can go for treatment, receive diagnosis and medicine without paying a penny. At the same time, free ophthalmological examinations are held for primary and secondary school teachers. The installation of X-ray equipment has also been completed, and fluoroscopy is proceeding as usual.

However, although the hospital directors have great relief aspirations, in this autumn of rising prices for everything, the expenses are huge. With limited manpower and financial resources, shouldering this arduous task is truly overwhelming.

This is also a way to help others.
