### Content of Two Important Cases Passed

As a result of thorough discussion of all the proposals, essential and concrete resolutions have been passed and are currently being actively compiled by the conference secretariat. Once the compilation is complete, it will be formally announced. The most important of these include the following two cases:

### Inherit Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Legacy and Complete the National Revolution

(1) "Launch a unified national salvation movement, inherit Dr. Sun Yat-sen's legacy, and complete the national revolution."

Reason: Since the Xinhai Revolution, China has been plagued by internal and external troubles, and has failed to advance as a modern nation. After the Sino-Japanese War, with the evolution of international relations, the domestic situation has become increasingly divided, the country fragmented, and the people displaced. The autonomy, independence, equality, and freedom that the entire nation yearns for, are nowhere in sight. Although the reasons for this are complex, the greatest obstacles to the development of our nation are no more than the aggression of capitalist imperialism, the disputes of party separatism, and the disruption of communist forces. These three factors are intertwined, creating a cycle of misfortune, and thus contributing to China's past decline and current predicament.

Therefore, to save the country today, we must first understand the source of the chaos and start with anti-aggression, anti-separatism, and anti-communism. To achieve success in these three areas, there is no other way but to inherit Dr. Sun Yat-sen's legacy and complete the national revolution. Only by completing the national revolution can we resist the aggression of capitalist imperialism and free Chinese society from its semi-colonial and semi-feudal character. Only by completing the national revolution can we eliminate the disputes of party separatism and build a revolutionary and powerful political system. And only by completing the national revolution can we curb the growth of communist ideas and prevent the spread of communist forces.

Since completing the national revolution is the only correct path to save China, all compatriots across the country should take this as their goal and unite their efforts. All those who in the past have been bound by party concepts, stages, ideological awareness, and regional prejudices, should abandon them all, and under the supreme principle of the nation and the country, launch a unified national salvation movement, form a unified national salvation front, unite sincerely, and work together for the national revolution. Through the unity of the people, we can form the unity of political forces, the unification of thought and doctrine, and promote the unification of action and steps. Only then can we build a modern nation and strive for the independence, autonomy, equality, and freedom of the nation and the country. Therefore, we propose launching a unified national salvation movement and, at the same time, determining the Three Principles of the People as the guiding principle for the unified national salvation strategy, following Dr. Sun Yat-sen's teachings, seeking the unification of national ideals, and then completing the national organization to seek the unity of national strength, and eliminating the obstacles to the nation and the country to seek the success of the national revolution. The situation is serious, and the national crisis is intensifying. The end of the war may not be the solution to China's problems. The people should be aware, unite, and strive for the permanent survival of the nation and the country. Is this appropriate? Please decide.

### Minister Matsushima Explains the Battle Situation in Okinawa and Ryukyu Islands: Will Cause Greater Bleeding to the Enemy

The regular meeting of the Press Department of the Allied Japanese Fleet stationed in China was held yesterday afternoon. Minister Matsushima, Lieutenant Matsumoto, and many reporters attended. Minister Matsushima gave a detailed account of the Pacific war situation and the battle of the Ryukyu Islands, which will cause greater bleeding to the enemy. The summary is as follows:

Okinawa and Ryukyu Islands Attack Targets

The U.S. Fifth Fleet is currently targeting Okinawa and Ryukyu Islands for attack. About a hundred ships are concentrated in this area. Some battleships and cruisers are shelling Okinawa Island, while other forces are landing on the Kerama Islands. B-29 bombers from the Mariana Islands are carrying out long-range bombing, and aircraft from the Fifth Fleet's 58th Task Force are attacking key areas in Kyushu, attempting to cut off the Japanese army's rear lines. Therefore, the battle situation in the Nansei Islands is becoming increasingly fierce. Since occupying Iwo Jima, the enemy has been targeting the Nansei Islands. Now their plan has gone from words to reality.

Enemy American Forces Are Weaker

The enemy's operational plan was decided at the Washington strategy conference and began on March 17 with the attack on Kyushu by their mobile force. Now they are preparing for the landing. The characteristics of this American operation are: (1) The enemy's forces are smaller than in the past. According to prisoners, the enemy suffered unexpectedly heavy losses during the attack on Kyushu. Therefore, it is expected that their forces will be much weaker than in the battles of Panay and the Philippines. (2) The enemy's preparations are very slow. The enemy's main transport force has not yet arrived in Okinawa. (3) The quality of the soldiers is poor, and the composition is uneven. The American army has found toothless old men over sixty years old, because the enemy suffered too much loss of human resources in past operations, and there are not enough manpower, so this phenomenon occurred. On the contrary, the Japanese army is in a favorable terrain, and the counterattack is very thorough, giving the enemy a heavy blow. As the Japanese General Headquarters announced on the 28th, 31 enemy battleships and cruisers were sunk near Okinawa, and the enemy's loss of force reached one-third of the total.

The War Will Be More Intense and Cruel

According to a United Press International dispatch from New York on the 21st, the attack on Ryukyu Island may be easier than Iwo Jima. This is the American view. Whether it is easy or not will be shown in the actual battle. Strategically, Ryukyu Island is different from Iwo Jima and Saipan. Ryukyu's position is a neutral zone in the defense of both China and Japan. Whether departing from Kyushu, Taiwan, or China, operations can be effective. Therefore, the battle between Japan and the United States in Ryukyu will be an intense and cruel battle. Now I will elaborate on the past achievements of Britain and the United States in operations and their forces:

Will Cause Greater Bleeding to the Enemy

In June last year, Britain and the United States used 124,000 soldiers and 3,495 ships of all sizes in the Normandy landings in Europe. In the Iwo Jima landings, the U.S. Marine Corps used 60,000 soldiers and 800 ships. The total number of soldiers was 220,000. In the Lingayen landings in the Philippines, the U.S. used 150,000 soldiers and 1,033 ships in the first four days, and the number of soldiers assisting was 273,000. We can learn from previous battles how many troops the Americans need to operate in the Pacific? From this, we can imagine how much different is the force they are preparing now from the Battle of Iwo Jima? The terrain of Ryukyu Island is a fragmented mountainous area, so it is not easy to build airfields on the island. The climate is extremely hot, and water is scarce. At this time of year, there are many poisonous snakes. (Minister Matsushima recalled that when he was a Navy Lieutenant at the age of 24, he went to Ryukyu Island and saw that the snake skin was used as a drum on the local sanshin, so we can imagine how many snakes are there.) Therefore, we are convinced that this Ryukyu battle will cause the enemy greater bleeding than the battles of Saipan and Iwo Jima.

Refuting the Enemy's False Propaganda

Finally, Minister Matsushima said that recently, the United States' propaganda has been extremely chaotic. For example, the Nimitz Command announced that 17 or 18 Japanese ships had been destroyed in the Seto Inland Sea of Kyushu since March 17, which is not true. If it were as the American side reported, then at least the names, styles, sizes, and tonnage of the ships would be described in more detail. At the same time, the figures of Japanese damage released by San Francisco or New Delhi are different. The enemy often uses the habitual trick of "according to Japanese reports" in propaganda, hoping to increase the Chinese and even the Japanese people's belief in their news. Therefore, news that is not available in Japanese reports can often be seen in their inaccurate reports.

Measures

(1) Use the proposition of unified national salvation as the center of the declaration of this conference. (2) Use Dr. Sun Yat-sen's teachings as the guiding principle of the unified national salvation movement. (3) Telegraph the country and overseas compatriots to clarify the proposition of unified national salvation, asking them to rise up together, jointly plan the process, and unite all parties, factions, regions, and circles to form a unified national salvation alliance.

### Guarantee Freedom of Speech and Establish Public Opinion Institutions

(2) "Request the government to guarantee the people's freedom of speech and assembly and adopt the public opinion institution plan."

Reason: The active purpose of politics is to seek the survival and happiness of the people. There is politics only when there are people, and there is no government without people. This is a definite and easy principle. Therefore, today, both internally and externally, we must unite the total power of the people and go to the government together to overcome the difficulties and deal with the difficult situation. Therefore, adopting public opinion is even more important than peacetime. We must allow the situation below to reach above, and then the government can use it as a wise policy. We must allow the intentions above to be declared below, and then the people can rely on it for proper cooperation. The government should provide possible relief for the suffering of the people, and the people should have a full understanding of the difficulties of the government. We should overcome difficulties with each other, negotiate in good faith, unite officials and people, unite above and below, and then we can establish a strong and innovative system. In the past few years, joint consultation meetings at all levels have been held in the north, cooperating with administrative institutions at all levels, where officials and people gathered together to discuss all issues in order to seek political innovation and administrative promotion, which has been quite effective. The late Chairman Wang personally attended the training and gave encouragement. This method seems to be universally promoted throughout the country to establish public opinion institutions. The situation is urgent. To complete the great cause of internal recovery and external liberation, the people of the country should unite sincerely and fight together. The government and the people should take the same steps and overcome difficulties together. Therefore, I propose that the government guarantee the people's freedom of speech and assembly, adopt public opinion, and establish public opinion institutions. Is this appropriate? Please decide.

Measures

(1) Please ask the government to promulgate an order guaranteeing the people's freedom of speech and assembly. (2) Please ask the conference to require the government to unify the structure of the people's movement and actively strengthen and develop a broad and in-depth people's movement. (3) The public opinion institution should be named the Council at all levels. (4) The Council should be set up in cooperation with the current administrative institutions at all levels. A National Council should be set up in the central government, and Local Councils should be set up in various places. (5) The Council should be composed of representatives elected by the people. The term of office of the representatives should be one year. (6) The session of the Council at all levels should be held once a year, and extraordinary meetings should be convened when necessary. (7) When the Council at all levels meets, the administrative heads at all levels must attend the meeting to explain and answer questions. (8) The government should issue and implement the organizational regulations of the Council at all levels.

### Commemorating the Martyrs, Ceremony Grand

Nanjing, 29th (Central News Agency dispatch) - The 29th was the Memorial Day for Revolutionary Martyrs. The National Government solemnly held a memorial ceremony at 9:00 AM in the auditorium of the National Government to commemorate the merits and great achievements of the revolutionary martyrs who devoted themselves to the National Revolution during their lifetime. More than 300 civil and military officials from all departments, ministries, and offices of the National Government, including Acting Chairman Chen, participated. The atmosphere in the auditorium was solemn and reverent, and the ceremony was conducted in a mourning atmosphere. At 9:00 AM, Acting Chairman Chen, wearing a black national dress, arrived amidst the loud sounds of military music, with everyone standing solemnly to welcome him. The ceremony began in the sound of music. After the Chairman took his seat, everyone stood at attention and sang the national anthem, and paid the highest respect to the national flag and the portrait of Dr. Sun Yat-sen. Then, the Chairman respectfully read Dr. Sun Yat-sen's will, and everyone paid respect to the spirits of the revolutionary martyrs, and observed a moment of silence. After the silence, the Chairman offered flowers to the spirits of the revolutionary martyrs in the sound of funeral music, and the ceremony ended.

### Japanese Army Prepares Fully, Abolishes Conscription Restrictions

Tokyo, 28th (Central News Agency dispatch) - The Japanese Army, in order to fully prepare for the final battle on the mainland, has revised the Army Recruitment Rules. The regional restrictions on conscription inspections and the call-up of young and strong soldiers over the age of seventeen, which were previously only applicable to the battlefield, will be abolished. Xiang soldiers of inappropriate age throughout Japan can be assembled at any time when necessary.

### Ambassador Cai Pei Returns Home to Report

Nanjing, 29th (Central News Agency dispatch) - National Government Ambassador to Japan, Cai Pei, left to return home some time ago to report to the Central Government and ask for instructions, and arrived in the capital on the 28th.

Achieve Comprehensive Peace and Preserve the Nation's Vitality!

The National Government issued an order on the fifth anniversary of the return to the capital, awarding him the Special Class Tongguang Medal to recognize his meritorious service. The government order is as follows: National Government Order, March 29, 34th year of the Republic of China, Wang Yintai is awarded the Special Class Tongguang Medal. This order, Acting Chairman Chen Gongbo.

Editorial

### Celebrating the Fifth Anniversary of the National Government's Return to the Capital

Today is the fifth anniversary of the National Government's return to the capital. Five years ago, the late Chairman Wang led and coordinated, without fear of hardship and danger. For five years, he struggled hard, and it can be said that there was no day that he was not in a tense situation. And in this year, unfortunately, Chairman Wang died of overwork and illness, and failed to see the completion of coordination. We express our infinite respect on the occasion of celebrating the anniversary of the National Government's return to the capital today.

In the past, on the third and fourth anniversaries of the National Government's return to the capital, we wrote articles to celebrate and express our expectations. Today, we review the progress of national affairs over the past year and look around at the current internal and external situation. We deeply feel that the various issues that we eagerly expected in the past are still the issues that should be raised today.

First, the problem of improving people's livelihood. On this day two or three years ago, we proposed: "For the benefits of the country and the people, the problems that the Chongqing side cannot solve, mainly such as food problems, price problems, corruption problems, and all problems related to improving people's lives, we hope that the Nanjing National Government must have the power and the way to seek a thorough solution. At the same time, the National Government will never repeat the mistakes that the Chongqing side has said and done and has failed." Since Acting Chairman Chen took charge of the Central Government, he first took clarifying officialdom and eliminating corruption as a prerequisite for administration. The problem of corruption has finally been rectified to a certain extent. As for the price problem, the Fair Price Maintenance Committee was first organized in the capital, and the crackdown on hoarding and manipulation was quite effective. The fair price work in this city has been effectively promoted, and the wind of speculation and price increases has also been restrained. The fair price measures in Nanjing and Shanghai will naturally play a leading role. However, the food problem is at the center of the price problem. If this problem is not solved, all fair price work will inevitably be counterproductive. Therefore, we hope that in the future, we will focus all our efforts on solving the food problem in order to truly improve people's livelihood.

Second, the problem of political innovation. Our premise for advocating political innovation is to establish expert politics and establish public opinion institutions. Expert politics means using people according to their talents and abilities, on the one hand, eliminating corruption and eliminating redundant officials. So that a new spirit is formed in politics and efficiency is increased. In this year, the government has paid attention to adjusting personnel, but it is necessary to further employ new talents. Secondly, in order to communicate the opinions of officials and people, so that officials and people can work together, it is necessary to establish public opinion institutions. The People's Representatives Conference of various provinces and cities currently being held in the capital can be said to be the beginning of the communication of public opinion, but we hope to further promote the establishment of real public opinion institutions, so that public opinion has the opportunity to be expressed regularly.

Third, the current Great East Asia War situation is moving towards a decisive battle. As we said yesterday, whether the enemy attempts to fight on the Japanese mainland or on the Chinese mainland, the military and civilians of China and Japan should rise up to fight as one. Only with a more united force can we deal with stubborn enemies. And the current military and political deployment of the Allies, we can see that they are all taking the seizure of time, rapid and practical as the only conditions. All our measures must also be rapid to seize time, cherish it, and not indulge in empty talk.

Acting Chairman Chen said in his speech to the People's Representatives Conference of various provinces and cities a few days ago: "The pain of the country and the nation can only be relieved by the efforts of the people of the country. The personal pain of the people of the country can only be relieved after the pain of the country and the nation is relieved." We should make every effort to relieve the pain of the country and the nation under the leadership of the government. But at the same time, we cannot ignore reducing the unnecessary pain of the people, which is enough to strengthen the efforts of the people to contribute to the government.

### Japanese Air Force Continues Attacks, Sinking 30 Enemy Vessels Using Soviet Ships; Japanese Naval Forces Achieve Results in Surprise Attack

Tokyo, 29th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced at 4:00 PM on the 29th: The Japanese Air Force continues to attack the enemy invading forces around Okinawa Island. From March 26th to 28th, the confirmed results are as follows: One battleship sunk, six cruisers sunk, one cruiser or destroyer sunk, seven destroyers sunk, one minesweeper sunk, nine battleships or cruisers damaged, three destroyers damaged, and two transport ships damaged.

A Certain Base, 29th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - The enemy's mobile units in the Okinawa area are still continuing to move recklessly. The Japanese army is also continuing its fierce attacks. On the 28th, due to bad weather, air combat was almost halted. The enemy mobile units are still continuing naval bombardment of Ie Island and the southern part of Okinawa Island. On the night of the 27th, Japanese naval forces attempted a surprise attack, sinking two enemy cruisers, damaging a destroyer, and sinking one minesweeper.

Enemy Plans to Invade Ryukyu Island

Tokyo, 28th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - Around 4:40 PM on the 28th, approximately 80-90 enemy carrier-based aircraft attacked the southeastern part of Kyushu. A group of 70-80 carrier-based aircraft attacked Miyazaki Prefecture, and another ten attacked Kagoshima. Enemy forces landed a portion of their troops on the Kerama Islands, while simultaneously continuing bombardment of Ryukyu Island, attempting to land on the island. However, they were met with continuous strong attacks by the Japanese Air Force. In order to cut off communications behind Okinawa, the enemy again mobilized its mobile units northward. The main objective of the enemy's actions is to attack the main Japanese airfields in southeastern Kyushu and to launch an air annihilation battle. On the 28th, B-29 aircraft from the Mariana Islands base flew to Korea, Kyushu, the Seto Inland Sea area, and the Kanto region six times, to scout for Japanese Air Force movements. Based on these facts, it can be seen that the enemy's invasion operation against Ryukyu Island is imminent.

### U.S. Invasion of Southwestern Islands is Purely Strategic

Tokyo, 29th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - The enemy U.S. Marines are using their full strength, appearing in the seas near the southwestern islands of Japan. On the 25th, a portion of their forces landed on the Kerama Islands, about 20 kilometers west of Okinawa Island. Based on the concentration of enemy land and sea forces in the southwestern islands and the tenacity of their current strategy, it is undoubtedly assumed that the enemy U.S. is attempting to land on Okinawa Island. The southwestern islands are 650 kilometers from Kyushu and 600 kilometers from Taiwan, located in the center of the Japanese strategic base between Kyushu and Taiwan, forming a typical strategic indentation. This attack by the enemy U.S. is a risky move to break into the heart of the Japanese strong quadrilateral defense. Under the courageous attacks of the Japanese air force on both flanks, the enemy fleet will suffer significant damage. Due to this strenuous operation by the enemy U.S., the recklessness of the United States' own strategy can be seen. However, they have to forcefully advance the war. The main purpose of the enemy U.S. attack on the southwestern islands is to rely on strong air force bases to suppress the encirclement of Japan by air and strengthen the strategic bombing to destroy the source of Japanese operations. At the same time, they also plan to use the air power in the area to threaten the transportation arteries of China, Japan, Manchuria, and the southern region, in order to further advance the war against Japan. In addition to this purely strategic intention, it also contains opportunistic operations with political intentions, which is evident in the facts. The purpose of the San Francisco Conference on April 25th is to use post-war international settlements as the core of the conference. Judging from the current situation of the Pacific war, although the encirclement of Japan has been suppressed to a certain extent, it cannot be said that the advantage in the war against Japan has been determined. Since last spring, the Japanese army has inflicted heavy damage on the Chongqing army through continuous preemptive attacks on the mainland front. After the continental north-south route was opened, it formed a strategic zone with favorable connections to the south. After eliminating the hostile elements in French Indochina, the Japanese forces connecting mainland China and the southern region have become increasingly solid. In addition, the enemy's losses on Luzon Island and the recent injuries suffered on Iwo Jima have actually reached 73% of the landing force. This statistic is the highest record in the Pacific war zone. From this, the number of casualties that the U.S. military will face when approaching the Japanese mainland in the future can be imagined. As such, the future of the Pacific War cannot be underestimated, and the facts propagated by the United States cannot be believed. This is a profound impression shared by all countries in the world. The American people deeply admire the spirit of "human bullet attacks" of the 100 million Japanese people. The damage caused by the U.S. military gathering its total strength to attack the Japanese mainland will be even more severe. Japan is terrified, and what facts will the enemy U.S. use to break the international and domestic uneasy atmosphere? As mentioned above, the rapid offensive against the southwestern islands is a purely strategic intention.

### "Japan Political Society" to be Established Today; Imperial Rule Assistance Political Association to Dissolve Simultaneously

Tokyo, 29th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - The long-planned new Japanese political association, the "Great Japan Political Society," has decided to elect General Kazushige Ugaki as its president. As all preparatory work has been completed, the inaugural meeting will be held at 2:00 PM on the 30th at the Central Cafeteria in the House of Representatives. Admiral Koiso Kuniaki and all appointees will attend. After the ceremonial rites, the chairman will be elected, and the progress of the preparatory committee, the name of the association, and the declaration of principles will be reported. Then, General Ugaki will be nominated as president, and President Ugaki will deliver a speech. Subsequently, the dissolution ceremony of the Imperial Rule Assistance Political Association will be announced, followed by a speech by President Koiso and a thank-you speech by Mr. Takao Gōdō, a representative of all members. Finally, the association will be dissolved.

### Enemy Aircraft Air Raid Kyushu, Suffers Japanese Counterattack

Tokyo, 29th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - Around 4:40 PM on the 28th, approximately 130 enemy carrier-based aircraft attacked air bases in southeastern and southern Kyushu. They were met with a Japanese counterattack, and the Japanese suffered almost no damage. The enemy's purpose for the attack seemed to be a reconnaissance in force.

Continental Base, 29th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - The enemy B-29 aircraft that continue to raid northern Kyushu depart from the Mariana Islands base. In the past, most of the enemy aircraft responsible for air raids on Kyushu were B-29s from deep within the mainland. Recently, these aircraft have been moved to the Mariana Islands, and the enemy U.S. is acutely aware of the difficulties in long-distance supply, which is worthy of attention. The continental supply route, which stretches across the Atlantic, Arabia, Africa, and India, makes even the enemy U.S., with its abundant supplies, feel inadequate. In order to reduce the labor of fuel consumption for supplying the B-29s and to replenish the B-29s at the Mariana Islands base, most of the B-29s concentrated in the Calcutta base group in India have been moved to the Mariana Islands to undertake the mission of air raiding Kyushu. The above facts prove that the Japanese air power on the mainland has been exceptionally strong since last spring. At the same time, when air raiding the Japanese mainland, they are often subjected to fierce attacks by Japanese aircraft from the mainland.

### Japanese Forces Launch Fierce Counterattack East of Manila; Right Wing Has Broken Into San Mateo

Luzon Front, 29th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - The battle situation on the right wing of the stronghold east of Manila is still dominated by the Japanese forces due to their brave counterattacks. After repelling the enemy forces that invaded their positions, the right-wing Japanese units broke into San Mateo, an important stronghold for capturing heat. On the night of the 23rd, after annihilating the remaining enemy forces, they fortified the area. Therefore, Japanese military units shelled the enemy's concentration points and camp areas near San Mateo, setting them on fire, and launched a heroic assault. The fire that broke out near the Kuji-O neighborhood on the outskirts of Manila was particularly fierce, and enemy ammunition caught fire and exploded. That night, more than forty enemy tank units near Marikina Peninsula also retreated south in panic. The Japanese forces in this area continued their counterattacks on the 24th and 25th, and the right-wing Japanese units attacked the enemy west of San Mateo. At the same time, they also sent a portion of their forces south, breaking into Marikina. On the night of the 25th, they posed a significant threat to the enemy's rear communication line in the Mecaiya area. Another team broke through the battle line and advanced towards the Majile camp. That night, several large explosions occurred in the camp area. However, the enemy continued its stubborn attacks on the central Japanese position and stepped up pressure on the Japanese left wing with a new division reinforced from the south. Fierce positional attacks have been launched in the area east of Antipolo for several days, but the battle line has not changed much so far.

### Japanese Forces in Zamboanga Claim War Results

Philippine Base, 29th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - From the enemy's landing in Zamboanga to the 25th, the main war results achieved by the Japanese army and navy units defending the area over 16 days are as follows: Approximately 5,500 personnel killed or wounded, 49 tanks abandoned and destroyed, 13 armored vehicles destroyed, 33 vehicles destroyed, 9 artillery pieces destroyed or burned, 13 machine guns destroyed, one aircraft hangar destroyed, nine barracks destroyed, 300 gasoline tanks destroyed, and multiple ammunition and food depots destroyed.

### U.S. Aircraft Indiscriminately Bomb, Japan Severely Protests

Tokyo, 29th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - The Japanese government, regarding the indiscriminate bombing of Naha, Okinawa Island, by enemy mobile units on October 10th last year, urged the U.S. government to pay attention and, based on humanitarian principles and international law, lodged a severe protest against the brutal act of killing innocent civilians. However, no reply has been received to date. Moreover, when B-29 aircraft bombed the mainland, they deliberately concentrated on bombing non-military targets, especially on February 25th, March 10th, 14th, and 17th, when they indiscriminately bombed Tokyo, Nagoya, Osaka, Kobe, and other places. The Japanese government, regarding the cruelty that has been repeatedly urged to pay attention to but has not yet been reflected, reserves the right to protest and the freedom to act, and is questioning the responsibility of the U.S. government. The U.S. is completely violating human principles and international regulations today, and its repeated public implementation of indiscriminate bombing is infuriating.

### Germany Decides Not to Seek Peace, Berlin Officials Refute Rumors Again

Berlin, 29th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - Huitong News Agency: Since the rumor that Ambassador Höörl, the German Economic Director of the Foreign Ministry, was probing for peace in Stockholm, the German Foreign Ministry has issued a statement stating that Mr. Höörl's trip was to negotiate technical issues related to German-Swedish economic relations and had no other mission. The spokesman solemnly stated that Germany has never taken any steps to probe for peace and will never beg for peace in the future.

### U.S. Forces Make Fan-Shaped Advance Downstream of the Rhine; Battles Especially Fierce on the Banks of the Main River

Berlin, 29th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - Huitong News Agency: The pressure on both sides of the battle downstream of the Rhine is equal. However, the U.S. First Army continues to advance in a fan-shaped manner to the east and southeast at the point of penetration in the Westerwald, with the left wing reaching Hachenburg in the Upper Sieg Valley area. The remaining two enemy routes were blocked by the German army after reaching the Dillenburg-Wetzlar line. The target of these two enemy routes is the Thuringen region, so their actions are quite noteworthy. Another part of the enemy forces is advancing south, passing through Bad Ems, attempting to outflank the back of the German Rhine defense line. In the Frankfurt area, after the U.S. Third Army crossed the Main River, more enemy forces crossed the Nors highway to respond. There are fierce battles for the Frankfurt train station. There has been little development in the Hanau area.

### The British are Tired of War

An American special correspondent recently commented on the situation in London: "There is no place in the world as deeply immersed in misfortune and despair as London. The British are completely tired of the war." Combining information from London, this may not be an exaggeration. In his report on the Crimean Conference, Churchill emphasized the brightness of the future to encourage the sluggish morale of the public. In reality, the situation in Britain can be said to be worse than the outside world imagines. After interviewing an "international affairs expert" who had just returned from London, the reporter felt even more deeply. He stayed in London for three months due to quasi-official matters, and interacted with the British authorities, so he is a person familiar with the situation in Britain. His observations are quite worthy of respect. The main points of his conversation are introduced below.

British newspapers are now striving to promote that Germany is about to collapse, and Churchill is also in line with this propaganda in his speech to Parliament, describing his hopeful observations. But in essence, this propaganda is nothing more than an attempt by British war leaders to alleviate the mental suffering of the British people. In other words, it is just a political stimulant to instigate the British people to support it for one minute and one second longer than Germany. There are many reasons why the British are tired of the war. The fundamental reason is that the so-called privileged class, which manipulated the government and was the true guiding class of Britain in the many wars before today, has now lost its war purpose. This can be clearly seen from Britain's attitude towards the Soviet Union. In the British mind, it is good that the Soviet Union is fighting the German fighting force, but beyond this, it is worrying. If the Soviet Union does more than this, the British will worry about the Soviet Union after the war. For the British Empire, with its privileged class as its center, if it falls from the world throne into a vortex of political and social chaos, this is certainly not what the British want. They know that it is difficult to defeat Germany without the assistance of the Soviet Union, so they cannot do without their ally, the Soviet Union. However, they dare not imagine that the Soviet Union can become a political and social victor after the war, and in fact their political intuition makes them have to believe this. This is the doubt, stupor, and stagnation that is lurking in London political circles. This is also the reason why politicians, diplomats, and writers are emphasizing that Britain must also achieve victory in the peace war.

When it comes to who is the victor in the peace war, the first is the Soviet Union, and the second is the United States. Regarding the Crimean Conference, Labour leader Greenwood lamented: "It is a great pity that all major international conferences are held outside of Britain. Today, among the three countries of Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union, Britain seems to be relegated to third place." His sigh may be directed at the privileged class, not at the working class, because it is irrelevant to the working class that the Soviet Union surpasses Germany, surpasses Britain, or surpasses the whole world.

Another opponent is the United States. Britain has been forced to provide many bases of the British Empire to the United States due to the necessity of war. People who pride themselves on owning an "empire" are naturally unhappy when another country with ambitions to build an "empire" appears. In the depths of the British hearts, the Americans are constantly climbing up in the direction of the Atlantic. Their upward climb, when the time comes, turns into the ambition to build an empire, demanding to cede the position of protector of the weak countries under British hegemony, which is naturally very embarrassing for Britain. There is also one more thing that scares Britain even more, and that is not the territorial aggression of the United States but its spiritual aggression. The American soldiers stationed in Britain are paid ten times more than the British soldiers, which makes it easy to win the favor of British women, even causing them to become pregnant. Today, many British girls around the age of fourteen have given birth to illegitimate children. This is a shocking fact. Anyone who has been to a British colony knows that the British extremely respect their women, and they are very unhappy when there is a conflict with the local natives. However, today, for the sake of the American soldiers who have run to the heart of the British Empire, British women, even upper-class ladies, are gradually becoming prey for others.

While Britain is being threatened by other countries as described above, Germany's V-1 and V-2 continue to attack the British Isles, causing them to suffer an average loss of one out of three houses being destroyed. The shock of the British is truly beyond imagination. Even if the damage to military supplies is not significant, the mental blow is enormous. This kind of terrible thing that has no sound and flies faster than sound can suddenly descend from the sky while walking, sleeping, or eating. For example, taking my own experience as an example, one night when I had just lain down on the bed and was dozing off, I was suddenly thrown onto a tree in the yard. I didn't know what had happened in an instant, but fortunately I was not seriously injured. The possibility of this kind of flying misfortune makes people uneasy. The nerves of London citizens are understandably fatigued. Churchill's loud propaganda that the war is about to end is also for this reason.

### Changning Police Bureau Cracks Down on Illegal Gambling Den in West Fahuazhen

After the elimination of opium and gambling in this city, some gamblers have gathered to gamble in secret again. On the night of the 27th of this month, a group of gamblers were gambling at a high-stakes game of "shaking the pot" inside the Huile Teahouse in West Fahuazhen, when the Changning Road Sub-bureau learned of this and sent police to raid the place.

### Central Reserve Bank and Banking Syndicate Loans to Assist in Purchasing Supplies; Loan Amount is Quite Large

### The Purest and Most Sincere Sympathy: Elementary School Students Donate "Read Old Books"

Our newspaper is running eleven free elementary schools, and in the past ten days, it has attracted sponsorship from all sides, especially from schools and elementary school students, who sympathize with those out of school and donate money and books, responding most strongly. Yesterday, the entire senior and junior classes of Daren Elementary School and the entire fifth-grade class of the Ningbo Association's First Elementary School in Shanghai sent letters, because they heard from their teachers about our newspaper's running of free schools, and they automatically used the power of collective sympathy to save money on candy, snacks, and pastries, and launched a campaign to donate old books they had read. We feel that this is the purest and most sincere form of sponsorship. We can excitedly say that if we can universally gain the pure and sincere resonance of all elementary school students in the city, the foundation of the ten free schools we are running can be entrusted to their sympathy. However, we hope that the scope of the free schools will be further expanded, and of course, we also hope that influential figures from all walks of life in society will also rise up to sponsor them. Do adults in society, especially influential figures, not have the same enthusiasm as elementary school students? Please read the letters from the elementary school students!

First: "Last week, we heard from our teacher that your newspaper was going to run ten free schools to help many out-of-school children. We were very excited to hear this. Because we are very fortunate that we can continue our studies even in these difficult times, but when we see those little compatriots wandering in the streets and lingering outside the school gates, we often feel infinite sadness. We are all future masters of the country, so why are their experiences so different from ours!

Now that we know that you gentlemen are enthusiastically advocating the running of free schools, we are so happy for the out-of-school children that we almost want to jump up, because they also have the opportunity to study. Therefore, several of our classmates saved the money for the past few days' snacks and desserts, totaling 15,200 yuan, and all of our classmates contributed a total of 839 old books that we had used before to your newspaper office. We hope to set up several free schools to save a few 'blind people with bright eyes' and create a few more useful talents for the country. We also hope that all the children in Shanghai will respond enthusiastically and do their best to help others. However, we are still in school and rely on our families for everything, so even if we have the will, we lack the strength, and the donations are limited. Therefore, we sincerely hope that influential people from all walks of life can donate more to make the cause a success. The entire senior and junior classes of the private Daren Elementary School bow."

Second: "Since we heard about the free school movement initiated by your newspaper from our teachers, all the students in the school have expressed enthusiastic sympathy and support, especially the younger ones, who are particularly enthusiastic. They immediately presented the snack money they had saved in the past few days to be used as free school funds. Our class also held a class meeting for this matter and discussed it for a long time. Everyone agreed that the 'free school movement' is a more pressing need today. Our class leader, Qiu Lanfen, said: 'In addition to deeply hoping that people from all walks of life will respond, it is best to mobilize all the students in the city to save a pancake's worth of money and donate it to the "free school fund." If there are 100,000 students studying in the city, wouldn't there be a huge amount of five million yuan? And this is very easy to do.' Everyone heard this and thought it was very right. They immediately took out the money they had prepared to save for a few days' worth of pancakes and raised 13,000 yuan to donate to the "free school fund." We think that if the students in the city can universally rise up, it will definitely attract the attention of the powerful people in society and gain their understanding! Our slogan is: 'Pancake money, help free schools!' 'Donating to free schools, happy in our hearts!' All students of the fifth grade of the First Elementary School of the Ningbo Association in Shanghai, Wang Qi."

Third: "Our school was founded by the school board in the second semester of the 32nd year of the Republic of China. Its purpose is to help poor out-of-school children, provide them with complete elementary school education, cultivate excellent character, and cultivate national citizens. Tuition and book fees are free. The relationship between the school board, the principal, the faculty, and the students is different from that of ordinary schools, that is, the entire school has the love of a family, without distinction between high and low. In order to cooperate with the school board's relief work such as providing clothing, porridge, medical treatment, and medicine, our school pays special attention to home visits. From the visits, we can see the extent of the students' family difficulties, which is beyond what ordinary people can imagine. According to statistics, more than 70% of all students eat coarse grains, 20% eat three meals of porridge, and only a few eat two porridges and one meal. Each semester, the number of students who register often exceeds the planned number of students, and it is a pity that we cannot accommodate them as much as possible due to economic constraints. Recently, we heard that your newspaper has initiated the establishment of ten free elementary schools and has received the support of people from all walks of life, with the ability to pool resources and efforts. Not only can the success of the ten schools be expected, but it can also be extended to achieve the completion of the initial free education. Although our school is small, its purpose is consistent. We will definitely follow behind, constantly encouraging ourselves to achieve complete success. We have specially sorted out more than 500 books and donated them as textbooks for free schools, and donated 13,775 yuan. We pray that you will check and accept them. Hua Guang Free School."

Fourth: We are very moved and admire your newspaper's kindness when we saw that your newspaper wanted to run free schools to educate those out-of-school children, giving them the opportunity to study. We think we live together in a society and should have a spirit of mutual help. But our strength is very small, all we have are old books. In addition, we have done our best, although it is only a small amount, it is also our responsibility. We also hope that all the children in Shanghai schools will rise up to donate, the future of free schools is bright and brilliant! Attached is a Central Reserve Bank note for 23,900 yuan and 414 textbooks. From the students of Bi Hua Elementary School.

Fifth: I am a student in class 2B who is requesting a scholarship from our school. These days, I heard the teachers say that helping others is helping oneself. I thought that I am also a person who is helped to study. If I did not have the scholarship donations from my classmates, how would I have books to read? So, I said to the classmates in my class: "Dear friends, we see the free school funds being sent to the Shen Bao every day. I hope that our class's wealthy students will also take some out to donate." They were very enthusiastic when they heard these words and donated. Now the total is 20,000 yuan, which I am sending now, please accept it. Sincerely, Feng Zhenbaobao, a scholarship student from the 2B grade of the First Elementary School of the Ningbo Association in Shanghai.

Sixth: In today's Chinese society, there are indeed too many children who do not enjoy schooling. Take Shanghai as an example, we can always see many wandering children lying in the streets and alleys every day. They are like a flock of lost lambs, wasting their golden time, which is really a pity, but it is also a major loss to the country! Therefore, since your newspaper established free elementary schools and Mr. Xie Lilin launched the movement to solicit free school funds, all walks of life have responded one after another. The students of all grades in our school are very enthusiastic and have saved their snack money to donate to the free school fund. Our class even convened a temporary class meeting for this matter a long time ago. Now we will first donate the 5,100 yuan we have donated to the free school fund. Although this number is small, we will still do our best to fulfill this duty that we should fulfill in life, and at the same time hope that all the children in the city will respond in unison, so that the illiteracy of our future China can be swept away. All the students of the sixth grade of the First School of the Ningbo Association.

In addition, Guoguang Elementary School donated 655 new and old textbooks for various subjects in elementary school. Guanghan Elementary School students donated more than 200 books, Zhimin Elementary School donated 135 books, and Huang Yuechang donated 6 books. Their enthusiasm for free education is commendable.

Solving the Pain of Illiteracy: Free Schools are an Important Task

A worker from Jiandong Printing Company, Zhi Nian, wrote a letter saying: "I am a worker with little education. Because I don't know many characters, I often encounter difficulties. Therefore, when I see people who are unwilling to study, I always try to persuade them so that they don't suffer the same pain as I do. Now that I see your newspaper running free elementary schools and Mr. Xie Linli launching the 'Free School Fund' movement, I feel that it is an important task at a time when there are a large number of out-of-school children. Therefore, I am willing to save 1,000 yuan from my daily expenses to use as 'Free School Funds,' and I have asked my colleagues Lu Shanchu, Li Yanzhong, and Yue Shuhai to each donate 500 yuan, totaling 2,500 yuan in national currency. Although the amount is very small, it is also my intention. I know that there are many people in Shanghai who are enthusiastic about education, and I hope that they can take out more money to save the general out-of-school children!"

Special Issue Commemorating the Fifth Anniversary of the National Government's Return to the Capital

### The Chinese Economy in the Five Years Since the Return to the Capital

— By Wu Sheng

In the blink of an eye, five years have passed since the National Government returned to the capital. As the saying goes, "A small change in five years, a big change in ten years." In these five years of turbulent times, the current state of the Chinese economy has also undergone transformation and evolution, resulting in a major change. However, which path has the overall economic trend taken over the past five years? How exactly did the National Government's economic policies operate, and what were their repercussions? Although these issues are now in the past, they are still worth reminiscing about and examining.

When the National Government returned to the capital, the overall situation was roughly settled, but there were sores everywhere. At that time, the main aim of economic work was recovery. Internally, it focused on establishing finance and stabilizing people's livelihoods. Externally, it aimed at Sino-Japanese economic cooperation and joint construction. Until the autumn of the 30th year of the Republic of China, the Central China economy was affected by the fluctuations of the world war situation and began to enter another stage. That is to say, whether in finance or trade, foreign relations gradually became isolated, and it became necessary to establish a self-sufficient economy. On the one hand, due to the decline of British and American economic power, various large-scale businesses formerly operated by British and American merchants were gradually taken over by Chinese people themselves. As a result, financial, insurance, and previously unseen investment groups were established one after another, transforming the face of the economic society. On the other hand, due to the reduction of imported materials and the expansion of consumption due to the prolonged war, the supply of materials could not be smoothed out. As a result, the price issue became the core of economic problems. Under these different conditions of objective circumstances, the National Government implemented various economic policies to save the economy and stabilize people's livelihoods, such as strengthening control, passively preventing economic disruption, and increasing production, actively seeking to improve the economic status quo. Although the effects were not significant, it has indeed established many great achievements.

The Chinese economy in the five years since the return to the capital can be roughly divided into four or five stages. From the return to the capital to the outbreak of the Great East Asia War in December of the 30th year, it was a period of post-war economic recovery, which can also be said to be a period of economic stability. In the 31st year, the old and new legal currencies were separated, causing great disturbances in the financial market. At that time, idle capital was rampant, and financial institutions developed abnormally. Therefore, the Ministry of Finance began active management of financial institutions, so this period can be said to be a period of currency system consolidation, and also a period of financial turmoil. On February 3rd of the 32nd year, the National Economic Conference decided on five guidelines for wartime economic policy, and the path that the Central China economy should take was finally established. The so-called economic control gradually entered the practical stage from this time on, such as the establishment of the Shanghai Business Control Association in March, the establishment of the Materials Review Committee by the National Government, and the announcement of the Provisional Regulations for the Movement of Materials in the Yangtze River Region by the Japanese side. In April, the investigation of speculative hoarding institutions in Shanghai was thorough, and in August, the Supreme National Defense Conference approved the measures for purchasing cotton yarn and cloth. Therefore, this period can be said to be a period of material control. However, the commodity market at that time was still full of a speculative hoarding atmosphere. Everyone felt that materials were becoming scarce day by day, and believed that hoarding goods was better than hoarding currency. This trend intensified, making the material and price issues increasingly serious. It was not until the government began the work of purchasing cotton yarn and cloth that the overall situation was stabilized. Therefore, this period can be called a period of material control, and also a period of speculation and hoarding. At the beginning of the 33rd year, the government made increasing production the focus of its policies. From the hard-fought experience of economic control work over the past year, it deeply realized that under the social environment in China, relying solely on the power of control was not enough to promote the smooth progress of economic work and the reasonable solution of people's livelihood problems. Control work and increased production must go hand in hand, and only then could the economic status quo be improved. In reality, the material production capacity in recent years has been too weak. Transportation problems, fuel and electricity problems, raw material problems, and production cost problems have only become more and more serious. The relevant authorities have worked hard and sincerely in this year to fight against the obstacles, targeting the real problems. Unfortunately, the issue of increasing production involves too much. Although a great deal of effort has been put in, it has not achieved sufficient results. Instead, the industry and commerce have become increasingly decadent, and the reduction in material production has inevitably led to a rise in prices. Four unprecedented waves of price increases occurred within a year. Therefore, the 33rd year can be named the Year of Increased Production, and it can also be named the Year of Prices.

In the five years since the return to the capital, the economic world has undergone such great changes, and the results of the transformation have been quite unsatisfactory. From a period of financial turmoil to a period of speculation and hoarding, and then from a period of speculation and hoarding to a period of serious prices, people's lives have become more and more difficult day by day. This is the reality, and this is an undeniable fact. However, it is right to attribute the difficulty of people's livelihood to the irrationality of the economic situation. If we blame it on the inappropriate policies of the authorities, it would be unfair. Try to briefly analyze the various special environments that our country has encountered internally and externally since the return to the capital, and compare it with the economic work of the past five years. Indeed, it has made a great contribution to the way to a sound economy. Now, I will make a simple review and summary of the salient points.

(1) Establishing Finance and Improving Finance

Finance is the mother of all administrations. Without money, there is no way to govern. Therefore, at the beginning of the National Government's return to the capital in the 29th year of the Republic of China, it first established finance. From the financial policy announced by Finance Minister Zhou, we can see the focus of finance at that time, which included:

(1) Stabilizing finance, (2) Maintaining the credit of public bonds, (3) Consolidating national taxes, (4) Abolishing exorbitant taxes and miscellaneous levies, (5) Guiding idle capital, (6) Consolidating trade, (7) Regulating people's livelihoods, (8) Assisting production.

Due to the changes in the objective environment, the content of the National Government's fiscal revenue and expenditure after the war has changed significantly compared to before the war. Before the war, customs and salt taxes were the mainstay of revenue. Now, the status of customs and salt taxes has declined, and we have to rely on other taxes or other sources of income as the backbone of revenue. According to the "Overview of One Year's Administration" published by Chen Zhishi of the Ministry of Finance in March of this year, the total national budget for the first half of the 34th year was 360 million yuan per month, which was still about 40 million yuan less than the expenditure, and there was an attempt to issue public bonds to make up for the overdraft. "As for the budget object, guaranteeing public security is the most important, accounting for more than 60% of the total budget. The decision is to increase production, followed by improving treatment." The so-called "guaranteeing public security" probably refers to military and police expenses, and the so-called "increasing production" probably refers to expenses in the areas of finance and industrial construction. The total national budget is 360 million yuan per month. If we consider the low value of the currency, then compared with the National Government's finances before the war, we can see how low it is. With these expenses, to do so many things, we should deeply understand the government's frugality and the spirit of hard work under such a poor financial environment. This is the reality of the government's finances in the past five years.

As for finance, after the outbreak of the Great East Asia War, the Central China economy underwent qualitative changes with the sharp changes in the international situation. Therefore, two phenomena occurred: one was that the old and new legal currencies lost their link value, and the other was the rise of Chinese and foreign financial forces in Shanghai. On March 30th of the 31st year, the Ministry of Finance announced the abolition of the equal exchange of old and new legal currencies, and began proportional conversion in late May, so as to gradually eliminate the old currency, expand the scope of circulation of the new legal currency, and stop the issuance of military tickets, so that the Central China region became a monolithic situation of Central Reserve Certificates. After a short period of struggle, it finally completed the arduous task.

During the period of currency system consolidation, the financial world was temporarily in great confusion. In addition, idle capital was rampant, and the economic activities of Zhushang were in a state of stagnation due to the Great East Asia War. As a result, Chinese banks, money shops, silver companies, trust companies, real estate companies, insurance companies, investment companies, enterprise groups, etc. rose up one after another, taking the opportunity to become active. The prosperity of the establishment was unprecedented. The independent expansion of Chinese financial power was best at this time. However, the good and the bad were mixed, and the speculative color was very strong. It was not enough to develop industrial finance, and there was more than enough to undermine the order of the economic market. The authorities of the Ministry of Finance had foreseen this, and in January of the 31st year, they promulgated the Provisional Measures for the Management of Financial Institutions to restrict it. After that, it was strengthened again and again. In the autumn of the 33rd year, the Ministry of Finance announced the Outline for Strengthening the Business of Financial Institutions in Shanghai Special City, and made further strict supervision of the business of various firms. Although the financial market failed to correct the source from this, the speculative hoarding atmosphere of various firms has been greatly frustrated.

(2) Comprehensive Implementation of Controlled Economy

With the persistence of the war situation, loopholes occurred everywhere in the operation of the free economy. Control work became increasingly tight due to the needs of the facts. On February 12th of the 32nd year, the First Plenary Meeting of the National Economic Committee passed five guidelines for wartime economic policy, which were promulgated and implemented by the National Government on the 13th. The content was:

(1) Regarding increasing producers

(2) Regarding adjusting prices

(3) Regarding saving consumers

(4) Regarding setting currency values and adjusting the balance

(5) Regarding improving economic institutions

The scope mentioned is very wide, and accurate guiding principles have been established for all departments of economic activity. The promotion of wartime economic work in the future will not go beyond the norms of the guidelines.

On March 11th of the 32nd year, the National Defense Conference discussed the issue of wartime material control. In terms of control institutions, it was decided to establish the National Commercial Control Association. In terms of implementation methods, the Provisional Regulations on the Movement of Wartime Materials were formulated, and the National Government issued an order: "The Provisional Regulations on the Movement of Wartime Materials have been promulgated. All regulations on the movement of materials in the Qingxiang area and the proposed rules for the movement of materials in and out of the country, and other similar provisions for the movement of materials, except for rice, shall be abolished." The next day (12th), the National Government promulgated the Provisional Regulations on the Management of Rice Sales in Zhejiang and Anhui. The Japanese Army, Navy, and Embassy jointly announced the Provisional Regulations on the Movement of Materials in the Yangtze River Region. From then on, fragmented and piecemeal material movement restrictions were changed to autonomous control by the Commercial Control Association, except for special materials. On the 16th, the Commercial Control Association established a material movement permit office, and took over the material movement permit matters from April 17th.

After the establishment of the Commercial Control Association, with the assistance of the Sino-Japanese Normal Bureau, it continued to move towards autonomous control. The first step was to start organizing joint associations of various industries. In the beginning, the preparatory directors and preparatory committee members of the various industry joint guarantee associations were designated by the competent department (grain or food), and supervisory officials were sent to supervise and guide the various industry joint associations to handle matters related to control. In addition to the various industry joint associations and trade associations, the Commercial Control Association, in order to ensure the careful management of the lower-level organizations, also established professional committees for various important businesses (which were changed to control committees when the Commercial Control Association was reorganized last year) to establish a complete and sound control system. Later, the Commercial Control Association underwent several changes, but as of today's fifth anniversary of the return to the capital, the spirit of merchant autonomous control still remains. Repeatedly, that is to say, each local area established trade associations by merchants in various industries, and united the trade associations in various places to establish industry joint associations. On the one hand, for various important business aspects, Chinese and Japanese merchants jointly organized business professional committees. Above them is the National Commercial Control Association.

With the establishment of the National Commercial Control Association, the National Government specially established a Materials Control Review Committee to strengthen material control and urge the Commercial Control Association to improve its functional use. Its tasks were: one, to be the National Government's review agency for controlled materials, and two, to be the Sino-Japanese liaison agency for material control agreements. After the establishment of the association, it worked in tandem with the Commercial Control Association, one being the practical agency and the other being the review agency. From then on, the Central China economy was incorporated into the scope of control.

On the one hand, the merchants came from the autonomy to govern themselves, and on the other hand, the government gradually took a positive attitude towards cracking down on speculation and hoarding. For example, in April of the 32nd year, Chairman Wang specially ordered a thorough investigation of speculative hoarding institutions in Shanghai, and the Finance and Industry departments jointly investigated the giant mortgage loans entrusted by banks. The Shanghai Economic Bureau investigated the materials stored in warehouses, and the Supreme National Defense Conference approved the regulations on punishing the crime of hoarding goods. Still afraid that it would not achieve sufficient results, it established the Special Materials Investigation Committee in Shanghai on June 19th to intensify investigation and crackdown work, and the compulsory purchase of cotton yarn and cloth temporarily made the atmosphere of speculation and hoarding almost cease.

(3) Increase Production

However, the stability of people's livelihoods and the soundness of the economy cannot be achieved by passive material control. The solution to the problem still lies in how to increase production. Otherwise, although material hoarding is cracked down on, there are still many ways out for investment other than materials. If control work is operated properly, it can prevent the occurrence of various economic contradictions, but the thorough improvement of the economic status quo cannot be achieved without cooperation with construction work. Especially in China after the war, the production process has not yet recovered, and the production progress is slower than the consumption figures. It is difficult to protect the smooth supply of materials and the stability of people's livelihoods by increasing production to the outside world. However, increasing production must have the conditions for increasing production and the determination to remove production obstacles. Otherwise, it is just empty talk and does not help the reality. If we have made the greatest efforts to eliminate production obstacles and are still limited by factual difficulties and cannot achieve the practical effect of increasing production, this is a special situation in wartime, and it is also a common phenomenon in belligerent countries. We only have to review the past efforts and consider whether they are appropriate and whether there is room for improvement.

The production in the five years since the return to the capital does not seem to have made much progress. Whether in agriculture or in industry, in the most recent year, it has only become increasingly thin and declining. According to past experience, there are about five obstacles to agricultural production: one is poor rural public security, two is frequent exorbitant taxes and miscellaneous levies, three is unreasonable purchase prices, four is the lack of fertilizer, farm tools, plough cattle, and capital, and five is that farmers cannot buy daily necessities, so their desire to produce is not excited enough. There are also the following obstacles to industrial production: one is the lack of raw materials, two is the reduction in the supply of electricity and coal, three is transportation difficulties, four is high production costs and sometimes unreasonable purchase prices, and five is that there are more convenient and simpler ways to make money than production.

Because production has not been able to proceed very smoothly, the price problem has become increasingly serious. In order to solve the crux of high prices and improve the difficult lives of the people, we hope that the production problem can be quickly turned around. Recently, the Agricultural Production Promotion Committee of the Executive Yuan, which is responsible for agricultural production, announced the agricultural production work for the 34th year of the Republic of China, and has a detailed plan for monthly production work. This is an expression of further launching practical agricultural production work targeting production obstacles based on past painful experience. At the same time, the problem of industrial dispersion in Shanghai and the problem of coal transportation have recently shown signs of improvement, and it can be said that industrial production has broken away from the worst scene and reached the road to regeneration.

Although the production situation in the past five years has not been very colorful, the increased production starting in the sixth year has possessed hope and great possibilities. As long as we continue to work hard, the economic future is full of light, and please wait and see everything in the future.

### The Municipal Propaganda Office Publishes a Letter to the Public

The Municipal Propaganda Office published the original text of the "Letter to the Citizens of this City on the Fifth Anniversary of the National Government's Return to the Capital":

It has been exactly five years since the National Government returned to the capital on March 30th of the 29th year of the Republic of China. The most important goal and the most significant meaning of the National Government's return to the capital are to seek peace and unity internally and to strive for independence and freedom externally. After five years of efforts, overall peace has not yet been achieved, but we have already had valuable gains. In terms of internal affairs, whether it is political construction or economic recovery, there have been considerable achievements. In terms of diplomacy, we have recovered concessions and abolished extraterritoriality.

Since joining the war on January 9th of the year before last, our country has jointly shouldered the mission of defending East Asia with the Allied Japan, and has fought against Britain and the United States with one heart and one mind, realizing the Pan-Asianism advocated by the Founding Father and the legacy of fighting together with the nations of the world who treat us equally. Because there is imperialism in Asia, peace cannot be realized. Therefore, we not only demand the realization of unity and peace, but also demand true peace in all of East Asia, so as to achieve the goal of national liberation, independence, and freedom.

On this fifth anniversary of the National Government's return to the capital, the Great East Asia War has entered the decisive stage, and our responsibilities in the future will naturally become even more important. But unfortunately, the late Chairman has left us again. When the various ethnic groups in East Asia are competing for survival, it is also a good opportunity for us to strive for independence and freedom and achieve realization. We should seize this precious opportunity, for China, for East Asia, and also to mourn the late Chairman, we must not be lazy or negligent, and contribute everything to the country, so as to complete the great task of the National Government's return to the capital as soon as possible.

Now, Acting Chairman Chen is an elder statesman of the party and the country, and continues to lead the people of the country in their old struggles. We should be more firm in our beliefs, recognize one ideology, and follow the three major national policies instructed by the late Chairman Wang under the leadership of Acting Chairman Chen.

First, truly think. Every citizen must wash away corrupt thoughts, reduce individualism, move forward in unison, fundamentally eradicate social evils, abandon the bottom and strengthen the strength of the country, and realize national groupism.

Second, ensure public security. Although this is the responsibility of the military and police, the people must be united with the military and police at all times and in all places, and gather all their strength so that public security can be established and the people can live and work in peace.

Third, increase production. During wartime, the lack of materials is a natural phenomenon in any country. Although the government is doing its best to implement production increase campaigns, suppress prices, and stabilize people's livelihoods, every country has a general responsibility. We must not only actively assist the government in increasing production, but also, in terms of consumption, save consumption, be diligent and self-disciplined, contribute to the country, and enhance our carrying capacity.

On this day when we celebrate the fifth anniversary of the National Government's return to the capital, we must thoroughly recognize the situation, endure hardship, work harder, cooperate with the allies, complete the war, and eliminate the aggressive forces of Britain and the United States. Implement the national policy of peace, anti-communism, and nation-building, to revitalize China and strive for the victory of the Great East Asia War, so as to defend East Asia.

### The Fifth Anniversary of the Return to the Capital

As the calendar turns to March 30th of the Old Republic Year 29, a scene celebrating the fifth anniversary of the National Government's return to the capital is presented before us.

Five years is by no means a long time. Those who find themselves amidst the turbulent currents of the world may truly feel that time flies too quickly. However, every time we try to recall five years ago, the arduous and difficult efforts of the late Chairman Wang in establishing peace, and the scars of war-torn China, covered in weeds and yet to recover, a review of the process of promoting peace over the past five years... These scenes seem like events of yesterday.

Five years, a brief five years. China has opened up new territories from ruins. The two great nations of China and Japan have moved from understanding and cooperation to becoming allies fighting shoulder to shoulder... This is the most glorious and splendid day in the new history of China.

The Capital - Today, five years ago, March 30th of the Republic Year 29, the national flag of the Blue Sky with a White Sun was once again flying over Nanjing, the capital.

At eight o'clock on an early spring morning, the late Chairman Wang, with a radiant spirit, appeared in the auditorium of the Nanjing National Government. At this moment, a solemn and respectful ceremony for the return to the capital was being held.

"Based on the principle of neighborly friendship, mutual anti-communism, and sincere cooperation, we will work together with our friendly nation Japan to establish amicable relations, realize peace in East Asia, eliminate past dictatorial politics, and plan to convene a national assembly..." The late Chairman Wang, in a sonorous tone, read aloud a section of this historic declaration of the return to the capital, word by word, so that all the civil and military officials present listened attentively in the solemn atmosphere, focusing their gaze on the stage. The fervent emotions in everyone's hearts burst forth at that moment.

In the afternoon, majestic military music wafted from afar on Zhongshan North Road. A large group of young people, marching in orderly steps, headed towards National Central University. This was the procession participating in the grand military parade celebrating the return to the capital. The winding ranks symbolized this surge of new life, which had begun to surge and stir. At this moment, the motherland was opening its kind arms to them.

Elsewhere, the International Club, which had once served as the venue for the Central Political Committee meetings, was now hosting a grand reception for foreign guests to celebrate the return to the capital. The late Chairman Wang spoke joyfully to the dignitaries from various countries, a hint of a smile on his face. From escaping Hanoi to today's return to the capital, he had written a tragic poem. Later, when raising a glass to wish the guests good health, a harmonious atmosphere spread to every corner of the venue.

Shanghai - Shanghai, a short distance from the capital, also simultaneously raised the flag of the Blue Sky with a White Sun, symbolizing peace, anti-communism, and national reconstruction, on the top floor of the Jianghai Customs House on the Bund, welcoming the wind. In front of the Zhabei Municipal Government Building, a huge red banner hung high, adorned with a string of golden characters that read "Shanghai Municipal Joint Celebration of the National Government's Return to the Capital." A burst of loud cheers was the song of praise from the majority of the people. Now that they were able to stand happily on this peaceful land, their heartfelt joy should be clearly evident on their faces. Look: the number of people who have joined the political affairs committees has exceeded 170,000, accounting for three-tenths of the city's population. This is clear proof that the old capital has been endowed with a new life and new vitality. It also sufficiently reflects how enthusiastically the people of North China are supporting the unified National Government. What is especially inspiring is the sight of the Blue Sky with a White Sun flags fluttering in the streets and lanes, creating a deeply moving impression.

Hankou - In Hankou, the frontline of the peace zone, a celebration rally with the same significance was being held in Zhongshan Park. When the large group of Wuhan citizens who had returned after the disaster saw the huge portrait of the leader displayed at the venue, they could not help but recall the lofty spirit of the leader who had escaped from Hanoi and delivered his fervent speech. Seeing this piece of land after the catastrophe, they understood that only the leader's dedication and sacrifice could have rescued them from danger, further recognizing the leader's great achievements, which are as immortal as heaven and earth.

On this day, the sound of jubilation throughout the country not only spread across North and Central China but also echoed throughout South China. In Guangzhou, this major city in southern China had put on a new appearance, welcoming this great holiday. The people's lantern parade held that night, with its colorful lanterns and dazzling torches, formed a splendid picture. Then, stirring military songs were sung by every parading participant. The electric cheers of the spectators on both sides of the road formed this lively scene, showing that China's path to a bright future was emerging in the light of the torches.

Five years have passed in the blink of an eye. These series of scenes linger in my mind. Looking back, my spirits are greatly lifted.

For the past five years, the sound of national jubilation has reverberated through the clouds. The year before last, we further resolutely embarked on the journey of defending Greater East Asia together with our ally Japan. The sound of national jubilation has turned into a shared sense of hatred against the enemy. Last year, the people of the country tearfully mourned the loss of their leader and marched forward under the leadership of Acting Chairman Chen, showing that with the same cries of support, the responsibility has been gradually increasing.

Today, five years later, especially as we joyfully celebrate this day's return during the current decisive battle, the scenes of past jubilation serve as the clearest mirror to give us courage, peace, light, and happiness. We must always cherish and wipe away any dust from this bright impression! (Central News Agency)

### Speeches by Wen Lantang and Yuan Ludeng Commemorating the Fifth Anniversary of the Return to the Capital

Wen Lantang, Chairman of the General Chamber of Commerce, and Yuan Ludeng, Chairman of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, issued the following statements on the occasion of the fifth anniversary of the National Government's return to the capital:

Wen Lantang's Statement: The National Government's return to the capital marks its fifth anniversary. Over these five years, the people of our country, relying on the leadership of the officials of the government, have rescued the nation's fortunes from turmoil, allowing the people to live and work in peace. The government, based on its determination to share life and death, has cooperated with friendly nations to participate in the war, working together with concerted efforts to rise up in unity. For the past five years, the people across the country have all tightened their belts, endured hardship, and dedicated everything to the government, hoping for the liberation of the Chinese nation. However, the industrial and commercial sectors of Shanghai have experienced numerous hardships, and production has sharply declined, reaching a critical point. In addition, recently, agricultural products have suffered from natural disasters and man-made calamities, and food supplies have become increasingly inadequate. Although the people are eager to serve the country, they are overwhelmed by their daily lives. Therefore, I hope that the government will immediately focus on people's livelihood, resolve all difficulties, stabilize people's lives, and vigorously promote increased production work, so as to assist the government in seeking final victory.

Yuan Ludeng's Statement: Now that the Greater East Asia War is entering its decisive stage, we are celebrating the fifth anniversary of the return to the capital. We recall that at the beginning of the National Government's return to the capital, the people across the country were in deep distress. Fortunately, under the leadership of the late Chairman Wang, government officials and people actively promoted peace, allowing the people to rebuild their old businesses and engage in work. Shanghai's industry and commerce have moved from revival to prosperity. The achievements of the government officials over the past five years have truly inspired the respect of all people. At this moment, the soldiers of our friendly nation on the front lines are bravely fighting the enemy to defend East Asia. We must spare no effort to actively promote increased production, provide supplies, and assist the government's determination to participate in the war. I sincerely hope that the representatives attending the Wartime People's Congress convened in Nanjing must each contribute their great plans and fully support the national policy to seek the survival of the Chinese nation and the final victory of the Greater East Asia War.
