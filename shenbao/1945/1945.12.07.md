### The National Army Will Smoothly Enter Shenyang; The Communist Troops in the Great Wall Area Flee in Disarray

[Our Newspaper Report] According to a Chongqing broadcast on the 6th, the National Army is driving straight into the southern part of the nine eastern provinces. It has now crossed the Xinmin Military Station, 99 li northwest of Shenyang, and is continuing to advance. General Du Yuming told reporters that he hoped to avoid bloodshed as much as possible and have the National Army arrive in Shenyang within one or two days, so he slowed down the advance. At present, the Soviet army has had a considerable impact on the Communist army, causing them to withdraw from Shenyang, so that the National Army can smoothly enter. The main force of the Communist army along the Beining Road and the Great Wall near Shenyang is now retreating in three directions, reportedly to the territory of Rehe Province and the border of Andong.

[United Press, Chongqing, 6th] According to a telegram from the Northeast front, the National Army is advancing along the Beining Road and is now only 60 li away from Shenyang, but is unwilling to enter the city hastily before obtaining Soviet consent. Shenyang is still occupied by the Soviet army, but there are no Communist troops in the city. It is reported that the Communist army is now moving towards Harbin and possesses a large number of aircraft. General Du Yuming, commander of the Northeast Security Force, does not have any aircraft. Before withdrawing from Jinzhou, the Communist army destroyed all the Japanese aircraft there.

[Reuters, Chongqing, 6th] Reports state that the Xinmin-Shenyang section of the Beining Road is generally intact, allowing mechanized units to quickly enter Shenyang.

[United Press, Chongqing, 6th] A United Press special correspondent reports that the National Army is eager to leave the best possible impression on the residents of Shenyang, so that the legal army of the Northeast Security Command is truly worthy of the name. Observers believe that General Du's ability to reach Shenyang smoothly is because the Communist Party's guerrilla tactics are no match for General Du's veteran troops. After recognizing this in a battle near Shanhaiguan, the Communist army retreated into the countryside to attack the National Army's long supply lines. In addition, Soviet pressure on the Communist Party has turned Shenyang into a vacuum. General Du is well aware that although his supply lines are far superior to those of the Communist army, he must now pass through a corridor of about 300 li, which is vulnerable to attacks by Communist troops waiting for an opportunity. Therefore, opening up corridors and occupying the cities and towns on both sides is more important than a simple advance.

[Central News Agency, Jinzhou, 4th] After the National Army entered Jinzhou, it thoroughly cleared the rear transportation lines and advanced in three directions: the northern route has reached Yixian and extended to the west, the central route has passed Goubangzi and is approaching the border of Panxian on the southern route. There are no Communist troops from Shanhaiguan to Suizhong, Jinxi, Jin County, and along the railway line. The Beining passenger train runs every other day to and from Qinhuangdao and has been unobstructed three times.

### Changchun Discussions Underway; Personnel Remaining in Beiping to Return to Work for Takeover

[United Press, Beiping, 6th] Regarding the issue of the National Army being airlifted to Shenyang, it is reported that Chiang Ching-kuo, Special Commissioner for the Northeast, and Marshal Malinovsky, commander of the Soviet occupying forces, are discussing it in Changchun today. Chiang Ching-kuo arrived in Changchun on the 4th with Chang Chia-ao, Special Commissioner of the Economic Commission. Malinovsky personally greeted them at the airport and escorted them into the city under Soviet military protection. It is reported that Chang Chia-ao has notified the Northeast Takeover Committee, which is staying in Beiping, that the situation in the Northeast has greatly improved, urging them to prepare to return to Changchun quickly. Deputy Chief of Staff Dong of the Military Affairs Commission's Northeast Headquarters has also made the same guarantee. When most of the personnel taking over the Northeast retreated last month, only General Dong and a small number of representatives of the various offices remained in Changchun, maintaining close contact with the Soviet authorities. It is reported that the situation is peaceful. The people of the Northeast are eager for the National Army to arrive. Xu Zhen, chairman of Liaoning Province, has established a temporary provincial government in Jin County, and will move into the city as soon as the National Army enters Shenyang. This is the first time in fourteen years that officials of the Central Government have resumed administration in the Northeast. It is reported that disturbances have recently occurred in Shenyang, but the reason is unknown. The director of the Northeast Security Command's Beiping office recently returned from Jin County and stated that the approximately 70,000 to 80,000 troops of the Communist armies of Li Yongchang and Liu Biao have split into small groups and are scattered between the Great Wall and Jin County. 20,000 have entered Rehe Province, and 7,000 to 8,000 have been captured by the National Army. Rumors that 20,000 Communist troops in the Northeast have been killed have not been confirmed by eyewitnesses or other reports. Li's troops entered the Northeast in mid-August of this year and were responsible for occupying Rehe and Liaoning provinces.

### U.S. Special Envoy General Marshall May Arrive in China Around the 20th

Commander-in-Chief He Will Meet Him in Shanghai or Chongqing

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 6th] Commander-in-Chief He Yingqin revealed at a press conference on the 6th, in response to inquiries, that the newly appointed U.S. Special Envoy to China, General Marshall, may arrive in China around the 20th, and he will meet with him in Shanghai or Chongqing.

[United Press, Chongqing, 6th] Well-informed sources in Chinese diplomatic circles say that regarding the U.S. policy toward China, it is still hoped that both the Nationalists and the Communists can achieve unity under the leadership of Chairman Chiang. It is said that President Truman also has this instruction for the new U.S. Special Envoy to China, General Marshall. They have prepared to welcome Marshall. [Reuters, Washington, 6th] U.S. Secretary of State Byrnes stated yesterday that General Marshall has been summoned to testify before the Senate Pearl Harbor attack investigation committee on the 6th, and will depart for China immediately after his testimony is completed to carry out a special mission for President Truman.

[United Press, Washington, 6th] Former Army Chief of Staff and U.S. Special Envoy to China, Marshall, testified today before the Pearl Harbor attack investigation committee, stating briefly that before the Pearl Harbor attack, there was no United Nations staff meeting that led the United States to war, except as a result of an attack in the Pacific. He personally participated in meetings of U.S., British, Canadian, and Dutch officials.

### The Communist Party Instigated Unemployed Soldiers to Throw Bombs at the National United University Normal College; The Truth About the Hand Grenade Case in Kunming is Revealed

[United Press, Chongqing, 6th] Two hundred professors from various universities in Kunming have begun a week-long strike yesterday to express their condolences for the students who died in the hand grenade tragedy, in support of the hand grenade tragedy. It is alleged that the unemployed soldiers were instigated by the Communist Party to throw the bombs and received 30,000 Legal Tender in compensation.

[Central News Agency, Kunming, 5th] The public trial of the National United University hand grenade incident and related cases in the city was held yesterday. There were a total of three cases, the third case being the most important, and the first two cases being relatively simple. The first case involved three students from the Officers' Corps assaulting students from Yunnan University on Zhengyi Road on November 30. The investigation revealed that students were posting slogans on the road, and a few students went to tear them down, resulting in a conflict. The Officers' Corps student Zhou Haiquan and others went to mediate, which led to an argument and they were assaulted. Yunnan University sent representatives to apologize the next day. The second case was the assault between Officers' Corps students from the Faculty of Arts and Law of the National United University and students on December 1. The investigation revealed that a group of students from the Officers' Corps were traveling to Daguanlou and were stoned by students outside the National United University, which led to a conflict. At that time, a hand grenade was thrown from inside the school, injuring only one Officers' Corps student, and no students were injured. The third case was the hand grenade incident at the National United University Normal College. Because this case resulted in student deaths and injuries, and the circumstances were serious, the interrogation was more detailed. The confessions of the main culprits in the third case are excerpted as follows: The grenade throwers Chen Qida and Liu Youzhi were brought in for interrogation. The military judge first asked Chen Qida about his place of origin and name. Chen Qida confessed that his original name was Chen Dongsheng, he was 38 years old, from Hengyang, Hunan, and had served as a deputy battalion commander. He became redundant in March of this year and started a small business in Kunming. The military judge asked: Did you go to the Normal College on December 1? He answered: That day, when I passed Daxi Men, there were many people, so I went to see what was happening. The judge asked: Why did you throw the hand grenade? He answered: I didn't throw anything at all. The judge asked: Someone has already seen you throw it with their own eyes, you must tell the truth. He answered: It wasn't my own idea to go. There was a man in his twenties who often drank tea with me in the teahouse. When I was drinking tea, I complained, and he came to me and said, "You work for the Kuomintang army, but they don't mean anything. They are all warlords, of course, you are working for them for nothing." He said, "Now I want you to do something that will bring you money and an official position." He told me to meet him on the side of Yunhuachi Road outside the North Gate on the night of the 30th. That night, he gave me 30,000 yuan and promised to introduce me to be the commander of a detachment, as long as I obeyed his command. At that time, we agreed to meet outside the North Gate at 9:00 a.m. on December 1. On that day, I went as agreed, and he took me to the Normal College outside the West Gate. When he saw many people gathered at the entrance, he said, "This is when you obey me and do things." He gave me two hand grenades and told me to throw them into the crowd there. After I took them, he walked away. At this time, I was wandering on the road, and it happened that a familiar friend, Liu Youzhi, came. He was in the same situation as me, so I called him and asked him to throw one too, and promised to give him 10,000 yuan. The judge asked: What is the name of this person you met in the teahouse, where does he live, and what is his name? He answered: He didn't tell me his address, he said his name was Mei Kai. The judge asked: When he gave you the hand grenade, did he say anything else to you? He answered: He agreed to meet me at Cuihu that night. The judge asked: How did you throw the hand grenade? He answered: At that time, I saw forty or fifty people crowding into the Normal College, and I followed Liu Youzhi all the way in. I saw people tearing down slogans and hitting slogan boards. There was a quarrel inside, and many people were running outside, and many students were chasing behind, throwing stones and mud. I thought the time had come, and I hurriedly threw a hand grenade. Immediately, the crowd ran in panic, and I ran away. After only a few steps, I heard another explosion, probably Liu Youzhi threw it. The judge asked: How did you get to know Liu Youzhi? He answered: I got to know him on the road when I was running my business. The judge asked: After you threw the hand grenade, did you meet Jiang Kai at Cuihu? He answered: I went, but he didn't come. The judge asked: Where were you caught? He answered: Because I didn't see Jiang Kai, I thought of going to Qujing. The next day, I went to the station and ran into Liu Youzhi again. He asked me for money. Because I didn't have much money on me, I only gave him a few thousand yuan. He was unwilling and quarreled with me, and the plainclothes police found out and arrested us together at the station. The military judge then questioned Liu Youzhi, who confessed that he was 32 years old, from Pujiang, Zhejiang, and had served as an adjutant in the Guizhou Security Office. After leaving his job in November of last year, he started a small business. The judge asked: Where do you live? He answered: I often run to Qujing and Zhan Yi, I don't have a fixed address. The judge asked: How did you get to know Chen Qida? He answered: I met him on the road when I was running my business. The judge asked: Who did you go to the Normal College with on December 1? He answered: I went out to play, and met Chen Qida outside Daxi Men. He said to me, "Now you don't have any money, I want you to help me do something. The students over there are in conflict. You help me throw a hand grenade and I will pay you 10,000 yuan." The judge asked: When did you throw it? He answered: After I heard an explosion, I threw it.

### Commander-in-Chief He Announced Yesterday That the Japanese Army's Disarmament Was Completed Ahead of Schedule; Delays in a Few Areas Due to Communist Interference

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 6th] Commander-in-Chief He held a press conference at 3:00 p.m. on the 6th, which was He's first conference before his return after being away from Nanjing for two months. Chief of Staff Xiao Su and others attended. He declared that, based on the recent reports on the progress of the Japanese army's disarmament in various places, it is clearly faster than expected (four to six months). As of now, 25 of the 35 Japanese divisions in China have completed disarmament, eight are in the process of disarmament, and only two remain to be disarmed. Among the 41 independent brigades, 24 have been disarmed, six are in the process of disarmament, and of the 20 other independent guard teams and detachments, 13 have been disarmed and three are in the process of disarmament. As for the five special forces units, only one remains to be disarmed. He continued, if counted by war zone and region, the disarmament of the Japanese army in various places, the 1st and 2nd Front Armies, and the 1st, 3rd, 5th, 6th, 7th, and 9th War Zones have all been completed. However, in the 3rd Front Army's Subei, the 10th War Zone's Haizhou, the 11th War Zone's Baoding, Shijiazhuang, Cangxian, and the 2nd War Zone's Pingyao and Qinxian, the disarmament was delayed because the Communist army destroyed transportation, and the National Army could not arrive at the designated location as scheduled, but the National Army is advancing at full speed. He declared that if the Communist army does not interfere further, the disarmament can be completed in December.

Transporting Japanese Prisoners and Overseas Chinese Is a Current Difficulty

Regarding the centralized management and transport of surrendered Japanese soldiers and Japanese expatriates back to their country, He believes that the problem is very large. There are about 1.3 million Japanese soldiers and about 470,000 Japanese expatriates in China, plus 400,000 Japanese expatriates in Taiwan, totaling more than 1.8 million. China lacks ships, so the transport of prisoners and expatriates back to their country has to be assisted by allied nations. The prisoners and expatriates are scattered throughout the recovered areas, and inland transportation has been largely destroyed by the Communist army, so whether they can reach the port on schedule is also a problem. However, He pointed out that since November 15, the United States has decided to use 107 landing craft and 7 seized Japanese transport ships to start transporting them in succession, and as of now, it has been reported that 61,000 have been transported out. As for management, He said that Japanese expatriate management offices and branches have been established in various places, not only to strictly restrict their activities but also to correct and reform their past erroneous ideas. The use of prisoner and expatriate labor is also actively underway.

There Should Be No Problem with Taking Over the Nine Eastern Provinces

After listening to He's report, more than 30 reporters asked questions one after another, like thirsty people seeking a drink. However, in general, the first question was about the takeover of the nine eastern provinces. He believes that there "should be no problem" with taking over the Northeast, because the Soviet Union has kept its word in the Sino-Soviet Treaty, and what remains is an internal problem of our country. At present, the Communist army is causing disturbances in various passes of the Great Wall, causing the National Army's takeover of the Northeast to be delayed again and again. He confirmed that the National Army was airlifted to Changchun, but explained that as of the report received on the 6th, only the airport ground staff had arrived in Changchun. He refused to confirm the rumor that the National Army had entered Shenyang.

Communist Army's Harassment Is Most Serious in Southern Shandong

Regarding the Communist army's harassment in various places, He pointed out that the most serious area at present is southern Shandong. Since the 24th of last month, Lincheng, Zaozhuang, Hanzhuang, Shagou, and other places have been attacked by the Communist army. They are clearly aimed at destroying the local coal mines. Although Hanzhuang and Shagou have fallen, the National Army is determined to advance forward to restore transportation and production in accordance with the Central Government's intention to truly liberate the people of southern Shandong from their suffering. The situation in the border areas of Subei and Hubei and Anhui has recently improved slightly. In addition, He also said that he did not participate in the Central Government's negotiations with the Communist Party in Chongqing, so he did not know the details, but he personally hoped that the Political Consultative Conference could be held smoothly, because peaceful unification is a consistent policy of the Central Government. Regarding the so-called civil war, "as long as the Communist army stops attacking, there will be no civil war."

The National Army Has Eliminated More Than Eighty Divisions

When reporters inquired about the recent situation of military reorganization, He said that as of October of this year, the National Army had eliminated more than 80 divisions, and the first stage of the planned program can be said to have been completed. However, the realization of the entire plan depends on how the Communist army problem evolves. He continued that the production of light weapons in our country is no longer a problem. The mission of the future U.S. military advisory group is to assist in the education and construction work of the National Army. All of this is good news for the future of military construction. As for my inspection of Taiwan, there is no fixed date at present.

### In Memory of Huang Fu

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 6th] The National Government issued an order on the 6th to commend Huang Fu. In addition to recording his life achievements in the National History Museum for biographical writing, the local memorial hall in his hometown will be investigated, repaired, and properly maintained by the Zhejiang Provincial Government to show the government's sincere remembrance of loyalty and nothing can be added to it.

### The Director of the American Affairs Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Will Be Temporarily Replaced by Cheng Ximeng; Chen Guolian Will Go to Shanghai to Take Office

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 6th] Zhang Zhongfu, Director of the American Affairs Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, has resigned, and Cheng Ximeng will temporarily replace him. Wu Aichen, Special Commissioner for Sichuan and Xikang, has recently been transferred to be Special Commissioner for Peiping and Tianjin. Chen Guolian, director of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' Shanghai office, took a plane to take office on the 6th. Chiang Chia-tung, Consul General in Batavia, is scheduled to leave Chongqing for his post on the 15th. Gu Zhaofen, Consul in Madagascar, has already taken office.

### Hurley Publicly Stated The Process of Acheson and Others Harboring Communists

[United Press, Chongqing, 6th] Hurley's testimony to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee yesterday is of great concern here and is being discussed. However, the Communist side refused to comment and only continued to criticize the U.S. troops stationed in China, demanding their withdrawal.

[Reuters, Washington, 6th] Former U.S. Ambassador to China Major General Hurley told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee yesterday that the reason he disregarded the State Department's instructions was to facilitate the Sino-Soviet Treaty. Hurley also revealed that he opposed providing the Chinese Communist Party with Lend-Lease weapons and equipment, and accused two former U.S. diplomats stationed in Chongqing of secretly undermining his position. The two diplomats were Service and Acheson, who later became political advisors to General MacArthur, Supreme Commander of the Allied Forces in Japan. Hurley also said that Service was a cunning diplomat who was originally assigned to work with General Stilwell in China. In October 1944, he submitted a "report allowing the National Government to collapse" to the State Department. Acheson repeatedly advocated supplying the Communist army with Lend-Lease goods to secretly undermine his position. After Washington recalled Service and Acheson this spring in response to his protest, Acheson was placed under his supervision. After talking with the British Prime Minister (Churchill), Foreign Secretary (Eden), and Soviet officials in Moscow, he sought to mediate between Chongqing and Moscow. However, the State Department instructed him "not to mediate or advise, but only to provide suggestions." This instruction was contained in a telegram signed by then-U.S. Secretary of State Stettinius. He ignored it because he believed that it contradicted his understanding of the instructions to promote China's unity and was therefore a misguided move. He believed that the Soviet Union fully agreed with the U.S. policy toward China and believed that the Soviet Union would abide by the terms of the Sino-Soviet Treaty signed in August. Hurley then denied that he was arbitrarily implementing personal policies in China to replace the work of the Washington government, saying that he had recently spoken with Communist leaders in Yan'an, advising them of the United States' desire for a political reconciliation between the various parties in China. He had some hope of success. At that time, Mao Zedong told him that the United States had a plan to "establish a Japanese empire under control as a stable force in Asia." When Mao Zedong believed that Acheson and Service had been appointed as MacArthur's political advisors, it proved that the United States had this intention, and the negotiations collapsed.

### The First Roundups of Traitors in Beiping and Tianjin; Wang Yintai and 240 Others Arrested; Nanjing to Try Traitor Cases Starting Next Week

[United Press International, Beiping, 6th] Last night and this morning, Beiping conducted its first large-scale roundup of traitors, with approximately 240 people arrested. While there is no official confirmation, it is widely believed that Wang Yintai, former chairman of the puppet North China Political Affairs Commission, along with Wang Kemin and Wang Yitang, are among those arrested. The Beiping Garrison Headquarters is carrying out this operation. While there has been no official announcement regarding the arrest of traitors, it is confirmed that two former mayors of the puppet Beiping Municipal Government have been detained.

[Central News Agency, Tianjin, 6th] Approximately one hundred traitors were arrested within five hours on the morning of the 6th, marking the beginning of the purge of traitors in the north. The authorities declined to release the names of those arrested but confirmed that Qi Bian Yuanye, one of the former key figures of the puppet North China Political Affairs Commission, has been arrested. Those also arrested include several former puppet mayors of Beiping and Tianjin, Qiu Yutang, an economic traitor who once served as chairman of the Tianjin Chamber of Commerce, Wang Hefang, former manager of the Hebei Provincial Bank, and several cultural traitors.

[Shanghai News Agency, Nanjing] According to sources at the High Court, a large group of traitors, numbering over two hundred, have been arrested in Nanjing. After being transferred to the court by the Chinese Army Headquarters, they have been detained at No. 125 Ninghai Road. Now that the National Government's regulations for punishing traitors have been promulgated for several days, and the people are eager for the major national traitors to be brought to justice and tried, the court is prepared to commence trials starting next week. The Jiangsu High Court, recognizing the significance of the matter, has decided to send several senior administrative personnel to Nanjing to assist in the proceedings. It is also reported that the first batch of traitors to be tried will include Chen Gongbo, as well as Mei Siping, Cen Deguang, Li Shengwu, Li Ouyi, Zhou Xuechang, and Guo Xiufeng.

### National Government Re-issues Regulations for Punishing Traitors (Continued)

If the case involves military personnel, the request shall be submitted to the highest military authority for approval. The National Government must be notified immediately after the property mentioned above is sealed, so that an arrest warrant can be issued. (To be continued)

### Editorial: Swiftly and Strictly Punish Traitors

The enemy's surrender has passed for over three months, and all measures are being actively implemented. However, it is regrettable that until recently, we have only seen the arrest of traitors reported in the newspapers occasionally or frequently, but we have not seen any legal proceedings against them. Recently, the Shanghai court held a public trial of a traitor case, but the first person to be tried in this way was merely a minor traitor who had served as an inspector in the puppet Ministry of Interior, and even now, there has been no final verdict. In addition, another publicly tried traitor case involved a foreman who had served as an interpreter for the enemy and a traitor who had served as a legislator in the puppet Legislative Yuan. At the same time, according to those in charge of the judicial organs, the judges handling the trial of traitor cases all reside in the court to avoid contact with the outside world and prevent being subjected to [illegible]. It is also said that the Shanghai High Court currently has only about twenty traitor cases pending trial; according to this newspaper's exclusive interview yesterday, the number of traitors awaiting trial is one hundred and two, who will be interrogated in batches of twenty. All of this inevitably makes us concerned again.

We find it strange that the number of traitor cases awaiting trial in the Shanghai High Court is shockingly small. In such a large city as Shanghai, a place where traitors used to gather, with all kinds of collaborators who had engaged in treason, the number of traitor cases awaiting trial in the High Court is only this small up to now. Of course, many cases have not yet been submitted to the court for investigation and prosecution. But for the court to have accepted such a small number of traitor cases awaiting trial in the past three months is truly astonishing. According to the regulations for punishing traitors and handling traitor cases promulgated by the National Government, officials of puppet organizations above the rank of Simplified Appointment and the heads of Recommended Appointment agencies must be punished. Even based on this alone, the number of traitor cases should not be limited to the few currently awaiting trial in the court. Furthermore, according to the aforementioned regulations, except for military personnel, the trial of traitor cases falls under the jurisdiction of the courts, with the High Court as the court of first instance. Thus, the number of traitor cases that should be tried by the courts should be quite considerable; why is the number of traitor cases currently awaiting trial in the court so pathetically small? We also find it strange that, according to those in charge of the judicial organs, the judges handling the trial of traitor cases all reside in the court to avoid contact with the outside world. The presentation of this statement undermines the dignity of the judges and the dignity of the court. A judge's impartiality and integrity are not determined by whether their residence is within the court, and avoiding contact with the outside world does not necessarily require living within the court. Even if one lives within the court, it is still impossible to avoid contact with the outside world if one wants to. Moreover, contact with the outside world is one thing, and firmness in judgment is another.

Therefore, regarding the handling of traitor cases, we cannot help but offer a few suggestions:

First, the handling of traitor cases is a matter of utmost concern to the people; delays in the proceedings can only dampen public morale. After Mussolini was captured by the people's armed forces in northern Italy, he was immediately executed. Although this was momentarily gratifying, it was ultimately not in accordance with the law. When handling traitor cases, we must ensure that everything is in accordance with the law and adjudicated according to legal procedures in order to uplift morale. The nation's legislation on handling traitors is based on leniency, but behind the "leniency in legislation" lies the profound meaning of "strictness in enforcement." Matters not specified in the regulations should not be arbitrarily prosecuted, while those clearly stipulated should be arrested, reported, and strictly handled by the courts in accordance with the law. Traitors apprehended by the army or other parties, except for those who can be subject to military trial according to the law, should be promptly transferred to the courts for trial, and should not be kept in detention indefinitely.

Second, while traitors may have different statuses, they are all traitors to the country. Therefore, when trying traitor cases, minor traitors should be tried by the High Court, and major traitors should also be tried publicly by the High Court in accordance with the law. Recently, we have seen the arrest of major traitors such as Zhou Fohai, Chen Gongbo, and Chu Minyi, but to this day, we have not seen their public trial. Although we know that all traitors, big and small, will be punished as they deserve, the delay in the trial still casts a shadow in the minds of the people.

Third, the handling of traitor cases should be swift. It has been two or three months since the arrest of traitors, big and small. These traitors can be said to be individuals whose treasonous acts are well-known, and they should be tried and punished immediately after their arrest in accordance with the law. Even if investigation or reporting is necessary, two or three months should be sufficient, and further delays cannot be tolerated. While traitors who have already been captured should be dealt with swiftly, traitors who are captured in the future should also be tried publicly as soon as possible after their capture.

Fourth, the strict arrest of traitors across all regions and the continued publication of their names are also essential tasks for the present. According to the items listed in Article 2 of the Regulations for Handling Traitor Cases, although the intention of leniency in legislation is not to delve deeply into other collaborators, the number of traitors who clearly fall under the various clauses of that article should be considerable, given the spirit of strict enforcement. After the restoration of power in France, the De Gaulle government dealt with over 400,000 cases of "French traitors"; in Belgium, 50,000 "Belgian traitors" were punished. The enemy occupied our country for eight years, during which the number of traitors of all sizes who met the criteria stipulated in the Regulations for Handling Traitor Cases must have numbered in the thousands or tens of thousands. However, since the restoration of our territory, the list of traitors we have seen captured is extremely meager. Among these few captured traitors, there are twenty awaiting trial in the Shanghai Supreme Court, or one hundred and two as reported by this newspaper. Whether it is twenty or one hundred and two, these numbers do not meet the expectations of the people. This is not to say that we are not making efforts to arrest traitors, but it is enough to remind us that our efforts in this area still need to be intensified. Marshal MacArthur has already captured 318 war criminals in Japan, and the number of traitors we have captured seems somewhat inadequate compared to this number. We should swiftly and strictly arrest the traitors who are still at large, continue to publish their names to inform the public. Furthermore, this approach has an additional benefit: it can provide the people in the occupied areas during the past eight years with a clear answer as to who is a traitor and who is suspected, so as to avoid indiscriminate arrests, a state of general insecurity, and the occurrence of many abuses.

In summary, the swift and strict handling of traitor cases is not just a matter of upholding laws and regulations; the revitalization and decline of the people's hearts, the maintenance and collapse of morality and justice, all hinge on this. Pétain held the rank of Marshal of France, and figures like Laval and Quisling also held important positions. They can now be subject to the sanctions of national law. But in our country, the major traitors and evildoers who collaborated with the enemy have not yet been brought to justice under national law, which has a significant impact on domestic morale and international perceptions. Therefore, we call for the swift and strict handling of traitor cases.

### Britain and the United States Signed Economic Agreement in Washington Yesterday; US Lends Britain $4.4 Billion for Reconstruction Assistance

[Reuters, London, 6th] The Anglo-American loan agreement was signed this morning in Washington. After twelve weeks of negotiations in Washington, Britain can now obtain a loan of $4.4 billion from the United States. After the negotiating parties on both sides finalized the details, they agreed on the loan terms last night. It is widely believed that the official announcement will be made tonight, and Prime Minister Attlee may also announce the outcome of the negotiations at the House of Commons meeting today. The British delegation will now proceed to Ottawa to negotiate credit loans with Canada. Sources in Washington say that Britain intends to borrow approximately £93 million from Canada.

[Reuters Special Correspondent, Bu Shu, Washington, 6th] The United States has agreed to lend Britain $4.4 billion, of which $3.75 billion is a credit loan for trade, and $650 million is for the final settlement of Lend-Lease items currently in the United Kingdom. Britain has agreed to abolish the Sterling Area exchange controls one year after the loan is approved. This historic agreement will revitalize Britain's war-torn economy.

### Truman and Attlee Issue Joint Declaration

[Reuters Special Correspondent, Bu Shu, Washington, 6th] British Prime Minister Attlee and U.S. President Truman issued a joint statement announcing the Anglo-American loan agreement, stating that the trade objectives of Britain and the United States are to expand the common goals of multilateral trade. The agreement enables the first common signal of equal rules governing international trade policies and relations to be realized.

The loan bears interest at 2%, repayable over 50 years starting December 31, 1951. Undersecretary of State Clayton stated that the total amount repaid by Britain would be $5.9625 billion. Britain may be exempted from paying interest in any year if its foreign exchange equalization account is deemed insufficient. Britain has agreed that within twelve months after the agreement comes into effect, all unblocked Sterling Area balances may be used for any currency and trade transactions. This agreement must be approved by both the British and American Parliaments. Clayton told reporters that the British had originally intended to borrow more, but he felt that this amount was enough to satisfy them. This loan is very beneficial to trade, and multilateral trade can be restored with its help.

Expanding World Trade and Establishing a Monetary System

While issuing the agreement, the U.S. State Department also issued a white paper to countries around the world, offering suggestions for expanding world trade. The joint declaration by Attlee and Truman stated that both Britain and the United States have always felt that establishing a world trade and monetary system, so that trade between countries can be conducted on a multilateral and consistent basis, is in the interest of both the British and American governments. The negotiations have been very smooth, leading to the conclusion of the agreement, in which the United States lends the United Kingdom $3,775,000,000 to facilitate the United Kingdom's purchase of American goods, assist the United Kingdom in coping with foreign exchange imbalances during the post-war transition period, help the United Kingdom maintain adequate gold and foreign exchange reserves, and assist it in shouldering the responsibilities of multilateral trade. This loan will enable the United Kingdom to reduce import trade and foreign exchange controls, so as to progress with other countries towards the common goal of expanding multilateral trade. The declaration also stated that $650,000,000 of the loan has already been lent to the United Kingdom to pay for the value of Lend-Lease items now within the country, which is the final and complete settlement. The United Kingdom, by paying for Lend-Lease items, obtains surplus assets, and the total amount owed by the United Kingdom to the United States for all equipment and other items within the United Kingdom is $650,000,000.

U.S. Suggests Countries Remove Trade Restrictions

As for the white paper submitted by the U.S. State Department to various countries, its suggestions include the following: (1) Revoking government-issued restrictions: governments should use their authority to revoke regulations that excessively restrict free trade. (2) Revoking restrictions issued by private industrial and commercial associations and trusts: it is suggested that a special agency be established under the International Trade Organization to receive complaints from all parties regarding various restrictions imposed by international industrial and commercial associations and trusts, and opinions on how to remedy them. (3) Preventing disruptions in major commodity markets: this matter should be addressed through mutual exchange of views between governments. (4) Preventing irregular states of production and distribution: countries should hold conferences and form general agreements, stipulating that a country will maintain sufficient and regular production, and avoid using methods that could harm other countries or hinder the expansion of world trade. (5) Establishing an international trade organization: formulating a charter similar to that of other United Nations agencies to regulate trade barriers, commercial restrictions, international commodity exchanges, etc.

### Christmas Approaching, U.S. Peacetime Production Not Yet Recovered, Precious Gifts Difficult to Obtain

[Associated Press, New York, 6th] Although the war in the United States has now ended, production has not yet recovered. The Christmas holiday is approaching, but precious Christmas gifts are still scarce and difficult to obtain. Whether rationed or non-rationed items, a sufficient supply will not be available until the beginning of next year. The following items are currently in the highest demand: (1) Automobiles: although they are no longer rationed, it will be difficult to buy them this year. The list of those registered to buy new cars is already miles long. (2) Men's clothing industry: almost completely suspended for wartime needs, tens of thousands of demobilized soldiers are still wearing uniforms, waiting for new clothes to be replaced. (3) Nylon rayon: American women must crowd in front of special sale counters to buy this high-quality silk stockings before the beginning of next year. (4) Housing: hotels are always full, and those who make reservations must wait several weeks to fill the vacancy. There is no sign of relaxation yet. In New York, if there is an apartment or spare room for rent, the door will be worn through by those who inquire. (5) Refrigerators: they are already being manufactured and assembled. There are many who deal in this, similar to car brokers. (6) Electrical appliances: manufacturers hope to quickly produce toasters, broilers, blenders, etc., for the market. (7) Carpet sweepers: New York stores are displaying this appliance for sale for the first time since the end of 1941. Suburban housewives can no longer bend down to the ground to sweep and clean carpets. However, stores in downtown New York still have other sufficient goods to meet the needs of Christmas, and a prosperous business can be predicted.

### Historical Documents of Sino-British Commerce: Letter from James I to the Chinese Emperor, Ye Gongchao Presents It to the British United Aid to China Fund

The letter was issued on February 7, 1613, and Sino-British commercial relations were initiated by Mr. Cox of the East India Company in 1615.

### MacArthur Orders Arrest of Konoe and Kido

The Emperor's Problem Has Become the Focus of Discussion

[United Press, Tokyo, 6th] Konoe Fumimaro, who served as prime minister three times, has been ordered arrested by MacArthur today. Also on the list are Marquis Kido, who was the Emperor's right-hand man during the war, and seven other war criminals, including Vice Admiral Uto, the unofficial special envoy sent to Germany to explain the China Incident, political economist O, Ogata, the vice president of the Tokyo Asahi Shimbun, Viscount Okouchi, a prominent businessman, Oshima, the former Japanese ambassador to Germany (who was repatriated from the United States today with other Japanese residents), Sakai, a member of the House of Peers, and Suma, an official at the Japanese embassy in the United States. Konoe had previously requested permission from the Imperial Household to become a commoner and is currently planning a new constitution for Japan after the occupation.

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 6th] The news that MacArthur ordered the arrest of Konoe and six other leaders has greatly surprised the Japanese political world. There are also rumors that the Shidehara Cabinet is on the verge of collapse. Cabinet ministers, when speaking to reporters, denied the existence of this crisis but admitted that there might be changes in the government structure.

[United Press, 5th] Whether Emperor Hirohito helped promote the Japanese war and whether he should abdicate - these two sensitive issues have been revealed today. Once answered, they will change Japan's future. Tanaka, a neutral member of parliament, asked the government for its opinion on the Emperor's abdication. Tanaka also said that since Konoe discussed the matter with foreign reporters, some parties believe that the Emperor's abdication is possible. Privy Councilor Matsumoto replied that publicly discussing the Emperor's abdication is too dreadful, but those who hold such "erroneous" views are not exempt. The same shock was caused when discussing whether the Emperor helped promote the Japanese war. At that time, the Emperor was meeting with the Privy Council to decide on submitting a proposal to the Japanese parliament to revoke the titles and decorations of war criminals.

Chinese representative Dr. Wellington Koo also supported the removal of all restrictions on making requests. He said: "The Trusteeship Council may consider certain wording insulting, but from the perspective of the petitioners, it may be very ordinary and reasonable. We must adopt a lenient attitude towards colonial peoples and give them the opportunity to express their hidden pain."

### Be an Uncompromising Example, Ensure a Clean Reputation, Said Fu Sinian, Acting President of Peking University

[Report from This Newspaper, Chongqing Airmail] Mr. Fu Sinian, the acting president of Peking University, recently told reporters:

Peking University Is Not Related

(1) Institutions above junior college must set an uncompromising example for the next generation of young people in terms of the four virtues of propriety, justice, integrity, and a sense of shame. Peking University originally asked all teachers to move inland. In fact, except for Zhou Zuoren and a few others, the few teachers who did not move inland also transferred to Yenching University and Fu Jen Catholic University to teach. Qian Daosun, the founder of the puppet Peking University, was not a professor at Peking University. Therefore, the professors of the puppet Peking University have nothing to do with Peking University.

No Appointment Letters Issued

(2) Minister Zhu once told me that there is no such thing as all the staff of the puppet Peking University being hired by the supplementary classes. Only a few were transferred to serve in accordance with the measures of the Army Headquarters for requisitioning enemy and puppet personnel. No appointment letters were issued, and it has nothing to do with Peking University.

Agreement of Opinion

(3) From the perspective of the overall situation, the opinions of Jiang Menglin, the former president of the school, Hu Shi, the president who will return to China next spring, as well as the Peking University faculty group, the alumni associations in Chongqing and Kunming, and myself are completely consistent. Regardless of the present or the future, Peking University will not allow personnel from puppet schools and puppet organizations to set foot in it.

Minister Agrees

(4) Lu Peking University has agreed not to hire people from puppet schools and puppet organizations to teach. This point has been agreed by Minister Zhu. Our goal is to ensure the clean reputation of Peking University. It is reported that Yenching University has dismissed all professors of the school who participated in the puppet Peking University. I admire this very much.

### Education Bureau Plans to Divide the City into Sixteen School Districts

[Special Dispatch from This City] The Municipal Education Bureau, in view of the fact that the municipal administrative area has been divided into 33 districts by the municipal government, has divided the school districts based on the distance and population of each administrative district in preparation for the implementation of national education. It is reported that before the bureau divided the school districts, the National Education Office sent personnel to the household registration section of the police station to investigate the population and the number of school-age children in each district as the basis for the division of districts. Except for the former Public Concession and the French Concession and the Hongkou area, which are each divided into two districts, the rest are merged as appropriate. A total of sixteen school districts are divided for the area where national schools should be established in the city. The total number of municipal elementary schools in the city is currently 109. Before the war, there were more than 200 public schools. At present, the number of schools restored is only half of that before the war. It is also reported that in the new administrative districts to be taken over, more than ten schools such as Sanqiang, Qiangshu, Maqiao, Qipu, Xinxi, and Zhuanqiao are all public schools that have been operating for many years and are now within the scope of this city. It is reported that Director Gu of the Education Bureau is requesting the municipal government to approve the plan.

### National Business School Faculty and Students Oppose Merger; They Support President Zhang to Strive for It with the Ministry of Education

[Dahua News Agency, Chongqing Airmail] The National Business School has been established for eight years. Graduates from all sessions have served in public and private institutions with remarkable achievements. After the victory of the War of Resistance, the Ministry of Education once planned to move the school to Shanghai in order to develop it. Recently, the school suddenly received a telegram from alumni in Chongqing that the Ministry of Education had a proposal to merge the school into a certain university. The faculty and students of the entire school were extremely dissatisfied upon hearing the news and initiated the organization of a school protection committee to continue to carry out school protection work and declared that no school is allowed to accept it, otherwise something unexpected will happen. The school, for the sake of proper caution, unanimously recommended President Zhang to travel to Chongqing immediately to insist on his position and strive for it with the ministry. It is now known that President Zhang has already traveled to Chongqing on a special trip. Relevant personnel of the school said: If a satisfactory result cannot be obtained, the faculty and students of the entire school will go to Chongqing on foot to petition. Before the decree has been issued, the faculty and students of the entire school are still doing their best to remain calm and continue to attend classes as usual.

### Daxia University on the Banks of the Chishui River

- Huang Yiqing

When the first bullet of aggression exploded on the Huangpu River, Daxia University on Zhongshan Road in Fanhuangdu, together with Fudan University on Jiangwan Road in Zhabei, moved west to Lushan and organized a joint university, setting a precedent for domestic joint universities after the War of Resistance. Subsequently, there were Southwest Associated University, Northwest Associated University, and Christian Associated University. When the National Army withdrew westward from Wuhan, Daxia University continued to move to Guiyang, setting up its own branch and struggling under the heavy pressure of high prices. The lectures have never been interrupted in the past six years. Last winter, enemy cavalry ravaged Dushan and Duyun. Daxia University moved again to Chishui County, on the border of Guizhou and Sichuan. At that time, the situation was tense, and the northward move was rushed, but the order was in order. It is still praised by people from all parts of the Southwest. A spirit of teacher-student cooperation and mutual assistance in the same boat has been fully demonstrated in this battle.

Because Chishui is located in a remote area and the people's wisdom is blocked, even during the war, the news from the outside world is still extremely isolated. Therefore, the area uses radio to broadcast news every day and publishes a small newspaper - "Quick News" twice. The citizens are all vying to listen to the news. Originally, in addition to carrying out specialized research in academics, a university also has the mission of transforming and promoting society. Therefore, all teachers and students use their spare time from research to cooperate with the local authorities in various undertakings such as education and health. Therefore, the local gentry and citizens have expressed their greatest welcome to the migration of the university to the north. In addition to providing various conveniences, they have also assisted in solving the problem of school buildings and school equipment.

Daxia University currently has colleges of literature, science, law, and commerce. After the Ministry of Education had a proposal to abolish the separate establishment of normal colleges, the university still plans to restore and add the most historical and prestigious College of Education. It is also heard that the Ministry of Education has approved the university to move back to its original site in Fanhuangdu, Shanghai in May next year. Currently, all teachers, students, and alumni are preparing for the resumption of school with all their strength. Soon, a new scene will appear on the banks of the Liwa Liyi River in Fanhuangdu, which has been deserted for eight years. But on the banks of the Chishui River, lined with green willows, perhaps the air will feel silent.

### Large Quantity of Confiscated Goods to Be Sold at Discount Prices Soon; All Secret Reports Thoroughly Investigated

The Shanghai District Enemy and Puppet Property Management Bureau has successively taken over more than 400 warehouses in the city. Of these, over 100 have been inventoried. Yesterday, the Review Committee processed the materials stored in 33 of these locations. A portion will be handed over to relevant authorities for use or sold through public bidding, while a significant amount will be directly supplied to the market at discount prices. Furthermore, the bureau has recently confiscated a substantial quantity of materials based on secret reports. These materials are stored in various warehouses. It was also decided yesterday that a portion of these will be sold at discount prices.

Significant Quantities of Daily Necessities

In addition, the finished products taken over from various factories by the Economic Special Commissioner's Office have been listed and submitted to the Review Committee for a decision on whether to distribute them to the market in batches at discount prices. It is reported that these materials are diverse and substantial in quantity, and it is predicted that they will be quite effective in stabilizing prices. Among the main daily necessities, it is learned that there are over 800,000 *jin* (approximately 400,000 kilograms) of oils such as rapeseed oil and soybean oil, 650,000 *jin* (approximately 325,000 kilograms) of beans such as soybeans and broad beans, over 6,500 boxes of various soaps, approximately 1,000 bags of sugar, over 10,000 *pi* of cloth, 23,000 dozen socks, 50,000 pounds of wool yarn, 40,000 porcelain basins, over 200 boxes of cigarettes, 15,000 *jin* (approximately 7,500 kilograms) of soy sauce, over 1,000 pounds of MSG, 1,500 cases of matches, 1,000 cases of glass panes, 1,300 rolls of newspaper, and 1,700 reams of foreign paper. The Management Bureau will decide on the method for distributing these materials to the market in batches in the near future. It is reported that the daily necessities decided to be sold at discount prices only account for a small portion of the materials received from various sources.

Furthermore, due to the imminent arrival of large quantities of foreign goods, there is an urgent need for warehouses. Therefore, the Review Committee has decided to expedite the clearing of warehouses. All agencies allocated goods and purchasers of goods are required to remove them from the warehouses within one week without delay. Otherwise, alternative arrangements will be made so that a significant number of warehouses can be vacated.

Actively Handling Tip-Offs and Issuing Rewards

The Enemy and Puppet Property Management Bureau has been receiving an increasing number of reports, which are individually investigated thoroughly, resulting in many breakthroughs. It is reported that rewards for tip-offs will be issued promptly, in the form of cash or valuables. Informants may submit written applications, which will be handled by the Management Bureau at its discretion. However, applicants for rewards in the form of physical goods are limited to the originally reported confiscated items. To ensure fairness and impartiality in the amount of rewards, the bureau's Valuation Committee will first assess the value of the properties recovered based on the tip-offs. Then the Accounting Advisory Committee will decide on the rewards. The lists of the Valuation Committee and the Accounting Advisory Committee are recorded below: (1) Valuation Committee: Chairman Zhao Zukang (Municipal Government), Members Wang Shiqi (Relief and Rehabilitation Administration), Zhang Dengyi (War Transport Bureau), Yu Bingjian (Municipal Telecommunications Bureau), Ling Xianyang, Chen Pengnian (Ministry of Finance), Gui Jihuan, Gao Boling (Ministry of Economic Affairs). (2) Accounting Advisory Committee: Chairman Pan Xulun, Advisors Xi Yushu, Xu Yongzuo, etc.

Sealed Radiators Not to Be Moved

The Enemy and Puppet Property Management Bureau stated that it has begun to handle the registration of requests from homeowners to recover radiators and heating equipment that were dismantled and removed without compensation by the enemy and puppets. No organization or group may arbitrarily move sealed radiators and other items. Furthermore, it is forbidden for shops and secondhand stalls to buy or sell radiators and other items of unknown origin. If discovered, severe punishment will be imposed. All owners may, within ten days, submit to the Management Bureau detailed reports including their name, nationality, address, location of the house, quantity, type, size, and other distinguishing marks of the removed radiators or heating pipes, along with all relevant supporting documents, for investigation and return as soon as possible.

Subcommittee to Study Solutions

Regarding the handling of remaining radiators and heating equipment whose property rights cannot be determined, the Enemy and Puppet Property Review Committee passed a resolution yesterday (6th) to form a subcommittee to study and handle the matter. The subcommittee will be chaired and convened by Deputy Mayor He Dekui, with Municipal Public Works Bureau Director Zhao Zukang, Police Bureau Director Xuan Tiewu, Management Bureau Directors Zhao Chuanding and Chen Guqiu, and legal advisor Cai Rudong as members. In addition, the British and American consulates and the U.S. military headquarters will be invited to send representatives as advisors to ensure fair and reasonable handling. It is further learned that most of the radiator heating equipment has been moved away or destroyed by the enemy and puppets. The remaining quantity is limited. In addition, the transportation of coal is not yet smooth, and coal prices are high. Therefore, heating equipment may be prioritized for hospitals, wards, and Allied forces to adapt to the current environment.

### Robbery Cases to Be Tried Under Military Law

[Special Report from This Newspaper] Army Chief of Staff General He telegraphed yesterday, granting approval to the Songhu Garrison Command to try all robbery cases during martial law, regardless of whether the perpetrators are military personnel, in accordance with Article 9 of the Martial Law. To expedite the handling of robbery cases in the city, the Songhu Garrison Command had previously telegraphed the Army Headquarters, requesting that all robbery cases, regardless of whether the perpetrators were our military personnel, be tried under military law and reported monthly to streamline the process and eliminate banditry.

### Mr. Liu Hongsheng Discusses the Distribution of Relief Supplies

To date, a total of nine ships carrying relief supplies to China from the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) have arrived in Shanghai, transporting over 80,000 tons of relief goods. This reporter specially interviewed Mr. Liu Hongsheng, Director of the Shanghai Branch of the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, yesterday. According to him, since the arrival of the first Liberty ship, the "Vida," on the 2nd of last month, carrying relief supplies to Shanghai, up to the ninth ship, the "Skinner," which arrived the day before yesterday, a total of 112,000 tons of flour, 310,000 tons of wheat, 3,100 boxes of dried beans, 650 trucks, 65,780 burlap sacks, and other miscellaneous goods, newspapers, galvanized iron sheets, water-resistant cement, road construction materials, medicines, old clothes, and canned fruit have been transported. Of the nine ships that have arrived in Shanghai, five have already completed unloading and are stored in warehouses. Four are still lacking vacant berths, two are currently unloading, and the remaining two are still in port.

Flour and Old Clothes Distributed to Various Regions

Among the relief supplies to China, almost all of the flour has been distributed to various regions, including 4,000 tons each to Qinhuangdao and Guangzhou, 1,000 tons to Hankou, and shipments to Qingdao and Taiwan. In Shanghai, 27,000 bags have been distributed to charitable relief organizations, with one bag distributed per person based on population. A large batch of wheat is currently being milled by flour mills and will be sold on the market in large quantities next week. Medicines will also be distributed to hospitals and medical institutions in the city and various regions, and several reliable pharmacies will be designated to provide free prescriptions to patients, requiring only a doctor's prescription to obtain the medicine from the designated pharmacy for free. Finally, Mr. Liu stated that old clothes will soon be distributed to Hankou, Pingjin, and other regions, while Shanghai will distribute them to various charitable relief organizations today. Each person will be given one piece of clothing based on the number of people sheltered by each organization.

### He Dekui Not Concurrently Serving as Director of Finance Bureau

Yesterday, a certain newspaper reported that Deputy Mayor He Dekui of the Shanghai Municipal Government might concurrently serve as Director of the Finance Bureau. A spokesman for the Municipal Government stated that this was inaccurate.

### Hong Lanyou and Lu Jingshi Rescheduled to Arrive in Shanghai Today; Wu Shaoshu Postponed Departure from Chongqing

Member of the Central Committee and Political Vice Minister of the Ministry of Social Affairs, Hong Lanyou, was originally scheduled to leave Chongqing yesterday on a China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC) flight to Shanghai, together with Wu Shaoshu, Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Party Headquarters, and Lu Jingshi, Director of the Organization and Training Department of the Ministry of Social Affairs. It has been learned that Vice Minister Hong was unable to depart yesterday due to official business and has rescheduled his departure for today. Chairman Wu will postpone his departure from Chongqing by one or two days to wait for Chairman Zhang Daofan of the Central Cultural Movement Committee to discuss the progress of the cultural movement in Shanghai.

### Inland Waterway Routes of Steamers to Resume in Short Order

[Report from This Newspaper] It has been over a month since the state-run China Merchants Steam Navigation Company took over the "China Inland Waterways Steamship Company." To understand the latest situation of the company's inland waterway transportation, the reporter specially visited the person in charge of the Inland Waterways Management Office yesterday. According to him, the vessels taken over include 53 small steamers and over 60 barges, but most of them are in poor condition. Currently, only over 10 small steamers and a portion of the barges can operate. The passenger routes that are operating are Shanghai to Pinghu, Suzhou to Jiaxing, and Suzhou to Huzhou, with one round trip each day. The fare is 800 yuan per person. Shanghai to Wuxi only provides freight service, with one round trip every two or three days. The freight rates are divided into four categories (A, B, C, D) based on the nature of the cargo, with charges exceeding 2,000 yuan per ton. The office is currently actively repairing the remaining damaged vessels to restore the original inland waterway routes in the short term to facilitate transportation.

### No Restrictions on Electricity Usage for Factories

It is reported that the Fuel Committee will supply as much coal as possible to the Shanghai Power Company from the coal shipped to Shanghai from Qinhuangdao, Lianyungang, and other places. Therefore, there will be no restrictions on electricity usage for factories thereafter, which will accelerate the development of production. It is hoped that this will lead to a gradual decline in commodity prices in the city. However, electricity usage for residential households will still be slightly restricted, and neon lights, being non-essential, may have their electricity supply discontinued.

### Feng Youzhen and Luo Xuelian Appointed Representatives of the Central Propaganda Department in Shanghai; Responsible for News and Film Aspects Respectively

To maintain close contact with Shanghai's cultural circles, the Central Propaganda Department has decided to appoint Feng Youzhen and Luo Xuelian as its representatives in Shanghai. Feng is responsible for the news and publishing fields, while Luo is responsible for the film and drama fields. They are also responsible for continuing to handle the enemy and puppet cultural affairs in the Shanghai area. It is reported that the unfinished matters of the former Central Propaganda Department Special Envoy's Office will also be transferred to Feng and Luo for handling.

### Settling the Blood Debts of the Eight Years; Deadline for Registering Enemy Crimes Extended; Over Three Thousand Four Hundred Cases Registered

The Enemy Crimes Investigation Office of the Shanghai District Local Court Procuratorate, which is settling the blood debts of the Shanghai area with Japan, originally set yesterday as the deadline for registering enemy crimes. However, due to the overwhelming number of people going to register in recent days, reaching over a thousand people each day, with some even arriving at the door of the Procuratorate on Mahua Road as early as 3 a.m. to wait for the opening, most of them coming from the rural areas of Wusong, Pudong, and Yangshupu, having suffered from the oppression and destruction of life and property by the enemy for eight years, they flocked to the Procuratorate to report enemy crimes and demand compensation. The number of people handling this registration work at the Procuratorate was originally only three, then increased from five to nine, and now has reached fifteen, but from morning to night, they are still overwhelmed. Because the residents in the urban area who went to register are less than 5 percent, while 95 percent are rural residents from the suburbs, and over 90 percent of them are illiterate, the reported crimes must be written by the Procuratorate's reception staff, which takes a lot of time. As a result, the maximum number of cases that can be accepted for registration each day is only 500. As of yesterday morning, 3,483 enemy crimes had been registered, and over 1,000 cases had already been assigned registration numbers and are awaiting processing. Therefore, the Local Court Procuratorate decided yesterday to extend the deadline for registering crimes. Among all the registered crimes, deliberate destruction ranks first. As of yesterday afternoon, over 8,000 buildings had been registered as deliberately set on fire and destroyed by the enemy. Next is massacre, and the third is torture, rape, and other cases, which also number in the dozens.

### Measures for Bidding on Small Factories Established

The Shanghai District Review Committee for Handling Enemy and Puppet Property has established three steps for bidding on 47 small factories, which will be publicly bid on in the coming days. The steps are as follows:

Categorization

(1) Before the bidding, the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Economic Affairs will first categorize the nature of the factories, such as machinery, chemical industry, and textiles. Then, the Appraisal Committee of the Review Committee will evaluate the prices, and then the bidding will be advertised and publicly solicited.

Factory Inspection

(2) The bidder's bid letter must include the bidder's name and address and state the bid price in detail. After the Review Committee opens the bid letters, it will notify the bidders to inspect the factory they wish to bid on on a scheduled date. The factories will then be opened for another three days to facilitate bidder access.

Deposit Payment

After inspecting the factory, each bidder must pay a deposit of 1% of the bid amount to the Central Bank within three days. The Central Bank will issue a receipt, which can be exchanged for a letter of intent to purchase the factory. After filling it out and submitting it, the Enemy Property Review Committee, the Enemy Property Management Bureau, and the Economic Special Commissioner's Office of the Ministry of Economic Affairs will jointly dismantle the bid in accordance with the bidding rules.

Priority Purchase

It is also learned that the following two types of bidders have priority purchase rights: (1) Those who have made meritorious contributions to wartime production; (2) Those who have held positions in the factory and have achieved results. Only then are the general applicants considered. Currently, the Valuation Committee has begun to separately price the 47 factories. The first batch of factory lists should be announced this week.

Graduated Police Cadets Begin Service

[Special Report from This Newspaper] To improve the level of the police and improve service efficiency, the Municipal Police Bureau has recruited a large number of police cadets and subjected them to rigorous academic training at the Police Training School. The first batch of over 500 people graduated a few days ago. Yesterday, they were assigned to various police stations to begin service, greatly increasing the strength to maintain public security in the city. It is reported that the bureau will soon recruit 100 old police officers and security corps police officers.

### Capital Registration for Various Industries; Filing Methods Decided; Procedural Aspects Given Flexible Handling

[Report from This Newspaper] The Municipal Chamber of Commerce notified various industry associations yesterday that there are specific deadlines for member registration during the reorganization period and for industrial and commercial registration with the Bureau of Social Affairs. However, how to fill in the capital, the most important item on the registration form, is the prerequisite for this matter. Currently, in addition to the Industrial and Commercial Law Research Association and various industries and experts earnestly researching and submitting a request to the competent ministry for approval, there is deep concern that the matter will be delayed for a long time. Therefore, after consultation, a method has been agreed upon. All member registrations during the reorganization period of the association and the industrial and commercial registrations of the Bureau of Social Affairs will temporarily be filled in truthfully according to the amount of legal tender actually received in a certain year before the war and the amount of counterfeit currency actually received when capital was increased in a certain year after the war. In order to complete the registration procedures as soon as possible. However, if the capital is filled in according to the amount of counterfeit currency actually received, it will be converted into legal tender at a rate of 200 to 1, which will be very small. When the first category of profit-making enterprise income tax is levied next January, it is feared that it will not match the actual capital situation at that time, causing an excessive burden on industry and commerce. It is proposed to approve waiting for each industry and commerce to wait for the principle of converting capital back to legal tender to be approved by the competent authority and then levy the first category of profit-making enterprise income tax according to the revised capital amount, without calculating it according to the current temporary registration amount. This will ensure that the registration problem and the taxation problem can be resolved separately and fairly.

### Zhang Yichu Presides Over French News Agency

Senator Zhang Yichu has been engaged in the news industry since childhood. As early as the Xuan统 years of the late Qing Dynasty, he followed the Premier in Singapore to advocate revolution. Later, he served as the Premier's aide and went to France. In the Xinhai year, he served as the representative of the Provisional President in France, writing articles for the Paris Morning Post to explain the theory of the Tongmenghui (Revolutionary Alliance), which aroused the sympathy of French people. It was not until 1931 that he left the political arena and was officially hired as the Director of the Chinese Department of the Far East Branch of the French Havas News Agency, making many contributions to the friendship between China and France. At the end of 1936, President Chiang flew back to the capital from Xi'an. Zhang was the first among foreign news agencies to report this major news to the world. Zhang served in the agency until early January 1941. He was forced to leave Shanghai due to the oppression of the enemy and puppets for supporting the leader and the National Government. He was then transferred to the agency's special correspondent in Chongqing. Later, because the Vietnamese government succumbed to Japan and became a Japanese puppet, he left the agency. When he was fighting in Shanghai, the rebel Ding Mocun mobilized all the bandits of the 76th Division, determined to kill him. Now, the World War has ended in victory for the United Nations, and the French Havas News Agency has been dissolved. A new French News Agency has been established, with its headquarters still establishing a Far East branch in China, and appointing Zhang as the editor-in-chief of the Chinese branch. Zhang has begun his service.

### CNAC Civil Aircraft to Land at Longhua

According to China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC) sources, the Jiangwan Airport in the city will be completely allocated for military use starting next week, and civilian aircraft will not be allowed to land. The company's aircraft will now land at the original Longhua Airport. Although the Longhua Airport was damaged by the enemy in the past and was unusable, it has now been completely repaired.

### Navy Announces Details of the Detention of the Minlian

The Shanghai Office of the Naval Headquarters stated that the Navy's Yong'an gunboat was ordered to guard the river surface near Zhenjiang due to rampant bandits, paying special attention at night. At 6 p.m. on the 2nd of this month, the Minsheng Company's Minlian ship and the Xuying and Minyu merchant ships arrived in Zhenjiang from upstream one after another. Instead of entering the port and mooring, they approached the north bank, creating a suspicious appearance. The Yong'an ship used international signal lights to inquire with the Minlian ship, but after 30 minutes, there was no response. A boat was then sent to inspect the ship. As the boat approached, it announced that it was a naval vessel, but the Minlian ship still ignored it and blindly opened fire, wounding Jin Yunkai, the executive officer of the Yong'an ship. He was sent to the Japanese Army Hospital that had been taken over. After examination by the doctor, it was found that a bullet had pierced his right abdomen, and five sections of his intestines were dissected. After suturing, he died on the 4th of this month due to excessive blood loss. It was found that the Yong'an ship had been ordered to guard the north bank of the Yangtze River and inspect suspicious ships. The Minlian ship and other ships were moored on the north bank, and the line of sight was unclear. After signaling to inquire and receiving no response, personnel were sent to inspect, which was their duty. Although they shouted, "It is a naval vessel, do not be afraid," the Minlian ship still ignored them and recklessly opened fire. The injured officer, Jin, refused to retaliate to avoid accidentally injuring innocent people and increasing misunderstandings. His handling was appropriate, and he has now died from his injuries. It is reported that the Naval Commander has submitted an official document to the Yangtze River Rehabilitation and Transportation Management Committee and the Minsheng Industrial Company, demanding a serious investigation to identify and severely punish the gunman, compensate for all losses, and provide preferential treatment to the victim's family to deter the unlawful and comfort the departed soul.

### Gold Bars! American Dollars! Girlfriend's Thieving Heart; Xue Guomei Detained for Interrogation

[Report from This Newspaper] Zhu Gengyong, also known as Lan Ying, the fourth concubine of warlord Zhang Zongchang, lives in a certain number of Zhongshi New Village on Yuyuan Road in western Shanghai. She has a close friend named Xue Guomei, who is 37 years old, graceful and charming. She lives in Zhu's home and has become intimately acquainted with a certain military officer.

Frequent and Close Interaction

Therefore, Zhu never misses going out for outings and watching plays. One evening (the 3rd), the three of them went to the Grand Theater to watch a play. Before the end of the show, Xue made an excuse to go out. Who knew that she had sinister intentions, hired a car to rush back to Zhu's residence, and took the key to Zhu's secretly hidden bank safe deposit box and Zhu Yiyong's private seal. She did not return to the theater until about two hours later. At that time, Zhu did not suspect anything. But on the morning of the 5th, Zhu wanted to take some jewelry to the Four Banks Joint Savings Society on the lower floor of the International Hotel. When the safe deposit box was opened, it was discovered that the storage drawers inside contained

Large Quantities of Gold Bars

Several rings, gold brooches, gold necklaces, and hundreds of American dollars were missing. She immediately returned home and interrogated the male and female servants in the house, but could not find any clues. She suspected that Xue Guomei had stolen them, but there was no evidence. Xue also vehemently denied it. In the afternoon, Zhu and Guomei took a rickshaw to the bank again to investigate. When they reached Avenyue Road (now Yan'an East Road) on Datong Road, Xue was unwilling to go and jumped out of the car to escape. Zhu saw through her hidden intentions and called the police to detain Xue at the Xin Cheng Precinct Station for questioning. She finally confessed to the crime. Director He of the Precinct Station ordered officer Huang Yingjie and others to rush to a hotel on the north side of Jie Road and detain the military officer for interrogation.

### Bloodshed Incident on Yulin Road; Drunken American Sailor Dies

[Special Report from This Newspaper] At the home of Xu Alin, a local resident at No. 27 Pingliang Road, Hudong, at 3 a.m. yesterday, two American sailors who were excessively drunk suddenly came to knock on the door. His wife went downstairs and opened the door, and was grabbed and hugged by the two sailors. She was terrified and shouted for help. Alin heard the alarm and rushed out. Unexpectedly, he was punched and kicked by the two sailors, causing serious injuries and falling to the ground. The two sailors then fled. Xu chased after them, shouting loudly along the way. When they reached the intersection of Yulin Road and Dayingwan Road, where the 3rd Independent Battalion of the Military Police was stationed, a sentry at the gate, thinking that someone was violating curfew, fired his gun. In the darkness, fearing that thieves were robbing pedestrians, he fired three shots into the air, followed by one live round, which unfortunately hit one of the American sailors, killing him instantly. The other sailor fled without a trace at the time. After being reported, the American Military Police Department drove a hearse to take the body back. Around 8 a.m., the American military authorities sent two officers, a captain and a lieutenant, to the scene to investigate the details of the incident. They also photographed Xu Alin, the victim of the assault, for the record. The deceased was named Mahoruhl.

### Social Services - Exchanging Old Legal Tender for New Notes

— Yong Yu

Recently in this city, it has often been heard that various businesses are refusing to accept slightly damaged legal tender and customs gold notes, causing obstacles to the circulation of legal tender for the people, hindering the unification of legal tender, which is truly unreasonable. I read in the "Letters to the Editor" column of your esteemed newspaper: "How to exchange damaged currency?" I am now writing what I know below to serve as a reference for those holding damaged banknotes. The Central Bank at 15 Bund, second floor, can exchange all damaged legal tender and customs gold notes for new notes. Not only does it exchange damaged banknotes from the Central Bank, but also damaged banknotes from other banks such as the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications. The exchange time is from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM and from 1:00 PM to 3:00 PM (I heard that there is no exchange on Saturdays). I think that for the convenience of all sectors regarding the circulation of legal tender, the Central Bank should immediately send a letter to all banks and firms to accept all damaged legal tender. At the same time, the Financial Commissioner should announce to all industries that slightly damaged legal tender should be universally accepted and not be hindered. I would severely punish those who obstruct legal tender with the crime of obstructing legal tender. In this way, legal tender and customs gold notes can circulate without borders, which is truly beneficial to all sectors.

### Visiting the HMS Belfast: Remarkable Achievements in the Anglo-German Naval Battles

Yesterday afternoon at 2:45 PM, over twenty Chinese reporters, led by a British Information Office representative, departed to visit the British Royal Navy flagship HMS "Belfast." The steamship traveled for about ten minutes to reach its destination. Admiral Servaes, Naval Commander, and Captain Dick were already waiting on deck. After shaking hands with each reporter, Captain Dick delivered a speech to welcome the reporters and expressed his gratitude for the welcome the ship had received from the people of Shanghai.

For the convenience of the visit, the twenty-plus people were divided into four teams, led by officers from the ship to visit various places. Our team was led by Captain Hilton. Sailors were busy painting in many places. The ship has four gun turrets, equipped with twelve six-inch cannons, eight four-inch dual-purpose guns, and anti-aircraft guns. Each gun turret has a special gun platform for control. The maximum long-range firing range can reach nine or ten miles, and the shells weigh sixty-five pounds.

Walking into a recreation room that can accommodate one hundred sailors, two young sailors were dancing the "Jitterbug." Movies can also be watched there. The navigation room and the command room are comprehensively equipped with various communication and signaling equipment to control the entire ship. In addition, there are position indicators and torpedo sights, which are equipped with great precision to manage all gun positions and torpedoes. Most of the machines are used in pairs to maintain balance. The ship has dedicated departments for everything related to naval warfare, including a chart room, a radio room, a weather room, and a water level measuring room. The middle of the ship has a flag deck and a signal room, with dozens of various signal flags in small wooden frames. In addition, there are eight small boats and three torpedoes. The relatively comfortable infirmary has twelve beds, and three military doctors are responsible for treatment. There is also a dedicated dental ward.

Arriving at the kitchen, the ship not only has several kitchens, but also a dedicated vegetable washing room. The cooks had just finished baking bread, which was extra-large. The cooks have already prepared the Christmas food. It is said that this cake can last for six months. The flagship's food not only supplies all the officers and soldiers on the ship, but also all the small boats in the Huangpu River.

Leaving the kitchen, it was exactly 4:00 PM, the ship was lowering the flag, and everyone stood at attention. Then we saw small teams of sailors on the deck being inspected for their uniforms and roll call by the captains. Soldiers go ashore twice a day, once at 1:00 PM and once at 4:00 PM, rotating shifts every day and must return to the ship before 11:00 PM.

The ship also has a special facility, which is the carpentry shop, a fairly large room where carpenters are busy making furniture. The equipment in the laundry room is particularly ingenious. Clothes are washed in a steam machine and placed in a rotating machine to dry. Ironing clothes is also done by machine, and a shirt can be ironed in two minutes.

At this point, the captains invited us in for refreshments. The furnishings in the officers' dining room were simple and comfortable. The people who came with us were very excited. Our team even forgot to visit the engine room. Although it was a bit dirty because of the oil, the equipment there was extremely sophisticated. The water filters and distillers were all in pairs, winding up and down, and we could hardly find our way out.

Although it was already 5:00 PM, we still didn't have time to visit all the equipment, but the sun had already set, and we had to say goodbye. Although we were all very grateful to the captains for their warm hospitality, we could only express our thanks in a few short words. Captain Dick also expressed his gratitude and, along with other officers, saw us off on deck, and the speedboat carried us back to the riverbank.

History of HMS "Belfast": HMS "Belfast" was built in Belfast, England, in 1939, at 11,000 tons. It was launched on September 3 of that year when Britain and Germany declared war, and served as a cruiser. In April, it unfortunately ran aground and was severely damaged. After repairs, it was relaunched in November 1942 and served as an escort in the North Sea, transporting supplies to the Soviet Union. In 1943, it sank the German cruiser "Scharnhorst". In 1944, it sank the German battleship "Tirpitz" in Aron Harbor. During the Normandy campaign, it worked for six weeks and made great contributions, and the damage it suffered was not great. Later, it visited Australia, Taiwan and other places. It arrived in Shanghai on September 19 this year. After the war ended, HMS "Belfast", although no longer participating in the war, still has important tasks. When will it return home? The captain said: "No one knows, maybe a few months, maybe a few days later." But they are all willing to spend more time in Shanghai, the largest city in the East.

### Music is a Source of Life

— Song Shouchang

The love of music is human nature. This can be seen in infants still in swaddling clothes. When they are crying or making noise, they will stop immediately once their mothers hold them, pat them a few times, and sing a few songs. Sometimes they are even lulled to sleep. Older children often like to draw on their faces, hold knives or sticks, and perform dramas. Singing and acting are their only games and entertainment. Even the most foolish coolies or farmers know to sing or perform operas to seek spiritual pleasure when they feel bored while working. This shows that human interest in music is innate.

For this reason, music has the most universal relationship with the public and the most profound relationship with human life among all arts. Music possesses a special power, which is greater than anything else. It can directly touch emotions without relying on objective things, so its effects are significant. The relationship between music and life is as follows:

Expressing meaning and emotion through language is more free and direct than writing. However, when expressing, it is necessary to put thoughts into the form of language. In other words, reason is necessary and emotion alone cannot be used to express language. Music, however, can be expressed directly without restriction and can influence the emotions of the listeners. For example, Zhang Liang of the Han Dynasty was able to disperse eight thousand soldiers with the power of a flute. During the French Revolution in 1792, Lisla composed the passionate "Marseillaise", which inspired the morale of the volunteers, and the revolution succeeded. When we listen to the Russian "Song of the Volga Boatmen", we feel infinite sympathy for the laborers. This incomprehensible power is indeed very magical. It can move people's emotions and make them forget themselves, unconsciously merging with the emotions of the music. Therefore, expressing emotions through music is the most direct.

The progression of musical tones in music has a certain length. The repeated recurrence of this form creates a sense of strength and weakness, which is called rhythm. The reason why people feel pleasure or sorrow when listening to music is entirely based on the effect of rhythm. Our physiological phenomena, such as the beating of the pulse and the circulation of blood, are the same as the structure of music, with a certain regularity. For the sake of our physiological needs, whether the ears listen to sounds or the eyes see things, they must be rhythmic and regular to feel comfortable. This applies to daily necessities such as food, clothing, shelter, and the various aspects of mental activity. If everything in life can develop a habit of rhythm, life will become richer and more fulfilling. The goal of the New Life Movement in advocating the disciplining of life is precisely this. The so-called disciplined life is a musical life. To have a disciplined life, we should have a considerable knowledge of music, contact music more, and be influenced by music more.

Food is material nutrition, and material nutrition is of course indispensable for life. However, the spirit also needs a kind of nutrition. What is this nutrient? It is music. Westerners believe that if one does not take in noble music, the spirit will lack nutrition, just as the body lacks nutrition if one does not eat every day. They regard music as spiritual food. Workers need labor songs to restore fatigue when they work, and soldiers need military songs to inspire the courage to kill enemies when they march. Lullabies are made for children to urge them to sleep. Even cafes and restaurants have music performances to entertain the spirit. We often see farmers singing mountain songs in the fields while cultivating, enjoying themselves. Laborers lifting heavy objects call out "Hang Yu Hang Yu", as if using this simple song to summon their strength to work, but do not feel tired. This is clearly the effect of music.

The relationship between music and life is so profound, and since human beings are inherently endowed with an interest and talent in music, we should use the power of music to give the public opportunities to appreciate music and form a musical life.

### The Victory of the Art Exhibition

— Zhong Baoshi

××: When did you go to Shanghai? I didn't know until I read your letter, but it seemed like someone told me you left on the 27th. Mr. Gu Shusen came to see my art exhibition. I asked him, and he said he had sent you off.

I am very grateful for your concern for my art exhibition. Do you remember when Mr. Lao She and I were eating at the Tianjin Pavilion in Qixinggang, I said after drinking that the art exhibition had good prospects? Now, thanks to your blessing, the result this time is really satisfying. Since the victory, even for such a respected figure as Mr. Chen Shuren, the art exhibition here has been only so-so. I was lucky to create a record. It should be considered rare for someone who has always been accustomed to solitude. A total of 102 large-format paintings and 50 album leaves were exhibited. As a result, two-thirds of the large-format paintings and one-half of the album leaves were sold. The celebrations today are unimaginable! But it also exhausted me!

I am now living a malaria-like life again, going to Central University once every other week. I expect to be able to leave here during the summer vacation next year, but I often think that if I were alone, it seems that I should also leave the "fog". But I can't, and the "victory" has added to my burden even more than the "resistance war"! I will resign myself to fate and be a "Sichuanese" for a considerable period of time.

Mr. Lao She's letter arrived at the same time as yours. He doesn't know how my art exhibition turned out yet? The letter is full of words of consolation, which is very grateful. He invited me to Beibei for a tour. I also want to go, but I remember that one person has already left Beibei, so it seems difficult for me to say yes. I heard from friends that Shanghai "Zhengyan Bao", maybe "Ta Kung Pao", has a Chongqing dispatch reporting on my art exhibition. I don't know if it's praise or sarcasm. He said that my paintings were sold out at a high price of 200,000 each. I don't know if this is true? Please check it out. You asked me to write a short article. I'll give it to you when I have time, but I'm afraid it won't be suitable.

### Artists Arise!

— Wen Zhaotong

Our ethnic culture is constantly progressing, and art is really the pioneer of national culture. The art movement in the rear during the War of Resistance did not stop, but in the occupied areas, artists were unwilling to express much due to temporary suffocation. But now is the time, especially in Shanghai, the cradle of China's new art movement. We must not let it decline. For example, Mr. Liu Haisu, a pioneer in the art world, should come out to lead us. When Mr. Liu was young, he introduced the most advanced artistic trends and styles in the world to China, and later introduced our inherent national art to the international art world. He has made immortal contributions to the Chinese art movement. He is already fifty years old this year, and he could have rested, but for the sake of the art movement, we cannot let him rest. Similarly, all artists who have put down their pens should rise up!

Notes from the Brush

### Those Who Eat Meat

—

When a tiger eats a person, it wishes it could swallow them whole, skin and bones included. Although it feels triumphant, it is ultimately just a "dumb brute" among the "meat-eaters"!

Think about it! People are "terrified at the mention of tigers," and hunters are eager to try, "setting traps to wait for them, and using bows and arrows to shoot them." Today's people even have "Browning and Thomson" guns. Do you think these brutes have any chance of survival other than "hiding deep in the mountains"? Otherwise, besides "surrendering", they must also contribute some "tiger bone plaster"!

Mosquitoes and fleas are much smarter! Their method of "eating meat" is more "scientific". They know how to select the essence and refine it. They only suck a little "blood" from people. They are not as ferocious and terrifying as tigers. The flea, it will be silent, as agile as skilled doctors giving injections and performing surgery. And the mosquito! It is even smarter. When it sneaks up, it will even sing a soft "hypnotic song" like a "nursery rhyme" or "lullaby"!

When you are sucked a little blood by a flea or mosquito, if it is just a little redness and swelling, "a skin disease is not worth mentioning"; if it brings you a terrible infectious disease, when you fall ill, you still want to use your own hand to slap your own mouth, complaining about why it didn't pay attention to diet!

Do you believe it? The facts are all there. Tigers have long disappeared, except for the few in cages in the zoo, while mosquitoes and fleas are rampant everywhere.

### Firecrackers

— Zhu Beihai

About two weeks ago, the municipal authorities issued a notice prohibiting the setting off of firecrackers, probably to "be careful of fire!" This made me think that in mid-August, when the citizens of Shanghai suddenly heard the news of Japan's surrender, they were all ecstatic. Although they were still under the pressure of enemy forces at the time, everyone's mind seemed to be eager to try, wishing they could immediately rise up, cheer and celebrate, to express their joy. In particular, everyone felt that they should have a large number of firecrackers in their hands, and set them off together to shake the whole city, which would be the most enjoyable thing.

It was not until the first few senior military and political officials arrived in Shanghai that the citizens had the opportunity to set off firecrackers to express a warm welcome.

However, as central officials came to Shanghai one after another, the firecrackers did not make a sound. I don't know why they lowered their heads.

In the short few dozen days, seeing the ups and downs of firecrackers, I couldn't help but feel emotional. So I drew a picture of firecrackers. Not only is the brushwork simple and ancient, but also the colors are bright and colorful. I felt very proud of myself. Then I copied the firecracker poem by the Qing Dynasty poet Jiang Xinyu on it:

The power of the cannon depends on gold and stone, but it is a pity that it is physically weak. A wisp of lightning triggers it, and spring snow flies in ten thousand layers. The body is broken due to the crazy medicine, and the heart is long with the opportunity for disaster. I don't know who is covering their ears, and still laughs at the thief who steals the bell.

### Shui Long Yin [a type of Ci poetry]

— Wu Renzhi

Due to the changes of the times, the commonly used words are also different. However, the old poems and lyrics are still the same. I once talked with several friends about trying to embed new words into the old lyrics to see what it would be like. This was still many years ago. At that time, it happened that a friend of mine and my student got married. My friend was a drawing teacher, and my student was the daughter of a poetry expert. Of course, she was also a master of poetry. In theory, it was a "perfect match" and a match made in heaven. However, because they were a widow and widower getting married, the local "gentry" "mutually criticized". I insisted on filling in a "vulgar song" to congratulate them. Their auspicious day was chosen in the summer, and that summer was particularly cool, which was especially gratifying. My lyrics have been destroyed by the war, but this song can still be recited today. Writing it down in silence is also a memorial.

Is life just for life? Do not heed idle words and gossips. Vulgar people's views, what is right and wrong, accustomed to wrong is right. The tradition of thousands of years, the concept that has been acquired is difficult to abandon at once. But we act with a clear conscience, what I think is right, I will do. It is good that the heavens have given beauty, how exceptionally cool is this summer? The heat has been hidden, and there is much convenience. Poets are elegant. A sweet honeymoon, enjoying the lakes and mountains, painting, love, poetry, and thoughts. What is it like for the immortals? Like them, they are a couple of immortals.

### Bulk Sales by Merchant Guilds, Gold Market Still Lacking Momentum, Public Bonds Stand Out, Commodities Weak

Yesterday, the gold market saw intense competition between bulls and bears. The initial price was flat, followed by weakness. Banks and securities firms absorbed a lot of gold, but merchant guilds sold off actual gold in bulk. There was no special news to stimulate the market. On the contrary, there were rumors that favored short positions. Major players were also discouraged and lacked the power to act. The market weakened further in the afternoon. The price fell with the US dollar, retreating to over 67,000. As a result, the closing price fell by 27,000 compared to the previous day. Decorated gold was priced at 75,000 per tael. Sycee silver remained at 650. Silver dollars also stood at 450. The unofficial interest rate was still above 1.3 at the beginning, but eventually weakened, generally between 0.1 and 0.12.

The US dollar also rose and fell with the gold market. Initially, it hovered around 1170 yuan, showing stability. But it finally gave way at noon. In the afternoon, currency exchange companies supplied a steady stream of actual dollars, continuing to plummet below 1130 yuan. The old Hong Kong dollar was slightly firm, while the new Hong Kong dollar continued to decline. As a result, the old Hong Kong dollar rebounded by 10 yuan, while the new Hong Kong dollar fell by 3 yuan.

The public bond market did not show any special features at the start. The lowest price was half a percent to one percent lower than the closing price of the previous day. After hovering for a long time, major players sold gold and bought bonds, causing a surge. Subsequently, major players in the stock market saw the opportunity and came in. Retail investors also followed the trend and competed to buy. The market closed at the highest price at noon. Miscellaneous bonds failed to catch up as much due to time constraints. As a result, the closing price rose by 20 yuan to 65 yuan compared to the previous day.

The stock market was slightly slack. With no prospect of resumption, many people switched to buying public bonds, resulting in a decline. There was a slight rebound at noon due to short covering. As a result, all stocks fell slightly, except for Xinguang, which remained flat. The trend is still uncertain. Foreign stocks were initially flat, followed by weakness. A lot of capital flowed into Chinese stocks, engaging in the purchase of small stocks, but the result was a decline of half a percent. Trading was mostly in Yisha, Yipijiu, and paper stocks, with the rest being sparse. Therefore, unpopular stocks were oversupplied.

Rice and grain: After a continuous decline, the rice market yesterday saw a slight stabilization. Medium-grade white japonica rice and indica rice showed a slight firmness. Baiyuan also tended to be firm. The Ningbo and Fujian merchant guilds were active but not prosperous in the flour market. The oil market also recovered due to active retail sales, rising by 2,000 yuan. Yellow beans were weak in the morning and firm in the afternoon. Corn was slightly over 1,000 yuan. Raw peanuts remained unchanged. The liquor market turned firm.

Yarn and thread: The decline has stopped, but the sentiment is still soft. The market opened in the morning with scattered buyers, raising prices by 10,000 to 20,000 yuan. But in a short time, sellers supplied very actively, and prices fell back to the closing price of yesterday. In the spot market, all factories are willing to sell, especially the 20-count Caihua Shuangxi and 16-count Guangming Tiannv brands produced by Shenxin Yarn Factory, which flooded the market, making it even more difficult for prices to turn around.

Dyes: Recently, the Sichuan and Yangtze merchant guilds have had some appetite, which could have stabilized the market. However, the holders of goods, seeing that all commodity prices were falling, did not dare to be reserved and started to sell off, so the market price became very weak.

Silk: The raw silk market was sluggish, with only a dozen or so bales opening. High-grade factory silk retreated to within 1 million yuan, a decrease of 50,000 yuan. The ordinary five-dan stalls were inactive. Retail and dried silk also fell by about 30,000 yuan.
