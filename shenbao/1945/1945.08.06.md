### Fierce Battles on the Right Bank of the Mekeik River Occupied by Japanese Troops in Burma; Reinforcements to Donggua Area Also Counterattacked

Burma Frontline Base, 5th (Central News Agency dispatch) - Japanese troops, after crossing the Sitang River, continued their advance. On the 26th, they attacked approximately 400 enemy troops at Leiktho, inflicting casualties on more than half of them. Furthermore, on the 29th at midnight, they seized Satthwa Chaung (4 kilometers northeast of Pegu) and its southwest B M332 position. The Japanese advance in the northern part of the Sitang River bend directly threatens Pegu. The enemy also acknowledged the Japanese advance, stating, "On the 29th, we encountered strong Japanese resistance 13 kilometers north of Pyu, and fierce battles ensued." The British Indian Army, 40 kilometers northeast of Pegu, also claimed, "We encountered a Japanese attack on the right bank of the Sitang River." The fall of Pegu is imminent. In addition, the Japanese special forces that crossed the Sitang River launched a fierce attack on the enemy from the highlands west of Mekeik on the morning of the 28th, occupying Mekeik, and launched a new offensive in the Mekeik area. Powerful Japanese forces fiercely attacked Toungoo on the 24th, repelling approximately 200 enemy troops and occupying it. The enemy is planning to increase its forces from the Toungoo area, and the Japanese are resolutely counterattacking.

Burma Frontline Base, 5th (Central News Agency dispatch) - The enemy's agitation is increasing due to the rapid Japanese advance across the Sitang River. The enemy troops on the opposite bank of Kyaukse (15 kilometers north of Mekeik) have been continuously retreating westward in recent days, now retreating to the Toungoo and Inywa Le (7 kilometers north of Mekeik) areas, constructing defenses. Furthermore, the Japanese troops occupied Mekeik on the morning of the 28th. The enemy launched repeated counterattacks on the 29th, and the Japanese troops took the opportunity to inflict heavy blows on them, firmly holding the position. Furthermore, on the night of the 29th, elite Japanese troops entered the vicinity of Satthwa Chaung, approximately 40 kilometers northeast of Pegu, continuing their daring and heroic suicide attacks. On the 31st, they launched a surprise attack on the enemy camp at Apya (35 kilometers north of Pegu), terrifying the enemy.

### Australian Forces Suffer Losses in New Guinea Fighting

Southern Frontline Base, 5th (Central News Agency dispatch) - Approximately 10,000 men of the Australian 6th Division began an offensive from Wewak and Maguericul area on the north coast of New Guinea, attempting to break through the Alexander Mountains in one fell swoop. At dawn on June 10th, the enemy attempted to advance again under heavy artillery cover, but the Japanese Wewak garrison held the positions on the southern foot of the mountains, overcame the unique swamps of New Guinea, and fought bravely against the enemy, inflicting great losses on them. According to information, from the beginning of this year to the end of July, the damage inflicted on the enemy by the Japanese forces, including confirmed enemy bodies left behind, has reached 6,000. The actual total number of enemy soldiers killed or wounded is feared to be no less than 9,000, a truly astonishing result.

### Balikpapan: Japanese Engage in Hand-to-Hand Combat

Balikpapan, 5th (Central News Agency dispatch) - The enemy has built defenses in a location 15 to 20 kilometers from Samarinda, but they have not launched a direct attack. All actions are merely skirmishes. The Japanese garrison continues to conduct night time hand-to-hand combat, inflicting considerable damage on the enemy. The enemy forces in the Dambaton area are trying to creep forward under cover. The Japanese garrison has repelled parts of them since the 19th. The results of the battles on July 30th and August 2nd include approximately 100 enemy soldiers killed or wounded, five tents destroyed, and one stockpile of supplies destroyed.

### U.S. Army Losses Exceed One Million

### War Situation in Various Parts of East Asia

Tokyo, 5th (Central News Agency dispatch) - The war situation in various areas this week is as follows:

Naval Forces: Since July 10th, enemy naval forces have continued operations in the Iwo Jima and Okinawa areas for about a month. Until July 30th, they carried out aerial operations against Kanto and Kinai with 1,000 aircraft. Small groups of warships echoed this, bombarding Hamamatsu on the 30th and Shimizu on the 31st. Furthermore, enemy submarines also began naval bombardment on land towards Sakhalin and Hokkaido. The Japanese forces are conserving strength and conducting counterattacks with anti-aircraft fire and parts of the air defense forces. So far this week, a total of 146 enemy small aircraft have been shot down and 198 destroyed. At the same time, Japanese submarine forces are also active in the central and southern Pacific Ocean, recently sinking several enemy battleships and transport ships.

Okinawa Area: Enemy forces in the Okinawa area are currently focused on strengthening their base. They seem to have about 600 B-24 aircraft in that area. Recently, there have been very few transport ships in that area, probably because they are too busy strengthening ground facilities to spare resources for resupplying base materials. Furthermore, a combined formation of approximately 300 B-24s, B-25s, and fighters from that area attacked the Kyushu area the other day, but their actions were extremely slow due to a typhoon.

Mariana Islands: The U.S. military claims that they will announce attack targets in advance when attacking Japanese small and medium-sized cities, intending to disrupt Japanese morale. The indiscriminate bombing with incendiary bombs at night continues to be carried out, and bombs are dropped exclusively on surviving factories. Approximately 20,000 large B-24 and B-29 aircraft have attacked from that area, a significant increase compared to the 5,000 last month. The reason is that among the aircraft that attacked in July, as many as 8,000 were enemy carrier-based aircraft.

Burma Area: The Japanese army is using the key points of the Pegu mountain range to contain the enemy for a long time, posing a major threat to enemy supply lines such as the Yangon-Mandalay highway and the Yangon-Kyoukse highway, preventing the U.S. military from having smooth logistics. The Japanese army is in close contact with friendly forces operating across the Sitang River, inflicting great blows on the enemy. Currently, they are gradually preparing for the shallow water battles on the east bank of the Sitang River.

Bougainville: The Japanese army is currently fighting bravely. In the Mirao and central Numai areas, Japanese forces are inflicting great damage on the enemy with clever counterattacks. Since mid-July, Japanese forces have killed or wounded 539 enemy soldiers and destroyed more than 20 vehicles in the Mirao River area. Furthermore, between July 1st and 18th, 70 enemy soldiers were killed in the Numai area. Enemy forces on Buka Island, north of the island, have recently begun to stir, sending out scout teams to try to infiltrate Japanese positions. The Japanese army ambushes troops in various places, taking the opportunity to kill the enemy and disrupt the enemy's rear. In recent days, dozens of enemy soldiers have been killed.

### Babbitt Discusses the Pacific War: Ending Will Still Take Time

Guangzhou, 5th (Central News Agency dispatch)

According to a Chongqing Central News Agency dispatch: General Babbitt, commander of the U.S. Tenth Air Force, who was recently transferred from India to the Chinese front, arrived in Kunming in early July. When interviewed by a Central News Agency reporter regarding the issue of supplying the Chinese war effort, he stated the following: Whether the United States will transport a large number of aircraft to Chongqing depends on the American supply capabilities.

Editorial

### The Outcome of the Three-Headed Conference

The Berlin Conference of the leaders of the three countries of Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union has been the focus of international attention, as it is believed to have a major impact on the future world situation. At the same time, because the conference was held at the time when the European War had ended, and most of the postwar issues related to Europe had been decided at the Crimea Conference and the San Francisco Conference, people generally assumed that this three-headed conference must have discussed the East Asian problem. Some people even said that the conference focused on the East Asian problem. Of course, this inference is not just speculation, but has a considerable factual basis. Combining the reports from the British and American sides before the conference, it can be clearly seen that the British and American authorities have done everything possible to jointly urge the Soviet Union to participate in the war against Japan.

However, the Three-Headed Conference held formal meetings 13 times from July 17 to August 2, and issued a communiqué in the three capitals on August 3. Looking at the content, it can be seen that this Three-Headed Conference still focused on the punishment of Germany and postwar problems in Europe, and did not establish any complete decision on the East Asian problem. This is a great failure for the British and American sides. The attempt and activities to provoke conflict between Japan and the Soviet Union have once again been thoroughly defeated. In order to avoid the blame from the people, Truman announced the reasons for making concessions to the Soviet Union before returning home, which shows how depressed he was in his heart!

The failure of Britain and the United States in the three-headed conference was not accidental. First of all, of course, the Soviet Union contributed the most and sacrificed the most in this European war, so its position in speaking out has improved. Secondly, it is obvious that Truman is not comparable to Roosevelt in diplomacy, and he is not Stalin's strong rival. Thirdly, the Conservative Party's failure in the British general election and Churchill's subsequent withdrawal from the conference halfway through made Stalin even more dominant. In addition, two more points can be noted: one is that the entire Soviet Union, as Soviet Head of State Kalinin said, has already "left the combat life and is moving towards demobilization, towards peaceful reconstruction and construction life," and will no longer allow itself to be instigated by others to move towards another bloody war; second, the people of Britain and the United States are also full of war-weariness and a desire for peace, especially the failure of the British Conservative Party in the general election and the victory of the Labor Party more fully reflect that people's attention has shifted from foreign to domestic affairs. In this new situation, any conspiracy for a major war will inevitably fail.

Therefore, the fact that the Three-Headed Conference had no concrete decisions on the East Asian problem was not an unexpected result. However, this does not mean that we can be relieved of concerns about new enemy maneuvers. Because the British and American ambitions to dominate the Far East are inseparable from the British and American imperialist system. Unless the British and American authorities decide to abandon their imperialist policies, any British and American leaders will continue to wage war to preserve their colonies and special interests in the Far East. In order to persist in the war, they will try every means to create a new environment that is unfavorable to Japan and East Asia. What's more, the Three-Headed Conference also issued a joint declaration by the British, American, and Soviet representatives, calling for Japan's unconditional surrender. The Three-Headed Conference also decided to convene a five-nation foreign ministers' conference in London before September 1. Although the task of this five-nation council is mainly to deal with European and general international issues, it is hard to guarantee that Britain and the United States will not carry out other maneuvers during this period.

The failure of the British and American provocation of conflict between Japan and the Soviet Union in the Three-Headed Conference makes us more determined in our belief that East Asians will solve East Asian problems and build East Asia for East Asians. The general trend of the world is increasingly favorable to this, and we should follow the established national policy, move forward bravely, and achieve the purpose of the Greater East Asia War.

### Airlift Supplies

In order to shorten the war, the United States is conducting an air transport campaign to China to the maximum extent. Although many ports along the coast have been restored, air transport is still an important means of supply, especially in China, where transportation is inconvenient. Mr. Babbitt also strongly stated that the prospects of the Pacific War must continue to be fought hard for a year or two before it can end.

### Pipeline Construction Workers Strike

Lisbon, 5th (Central News Agency dispatch) - According to a Reuters dispatch from Chongqing: U.S. military commander in Chongqing, General Wedemeyer, stated on the 3rd on the issue of lending weapons to the Chongqing army under U.S. military training that the construction workers of the India-Chongqing pipeline, which is extremely important to this issue, have recently gone on strike collectively, resulting in unfavorable progress in construction. He added that certain military supplies will also no longer be transported to Chongqing, and countermeasures are currently being considered.

### One U.S. Submarine Sunk

Frontline Aviation Base, 5th (Central News Agency dispatch) - At approximately 10:13 AM on the morning of the 4th, Japanese air force units discovered a U.S. submarine on the sea surface southeast of Cape Inubozaki, and launched a fierce attack, machine-gunning it. Numerous shots hit the bridge and the front of the ship. The enemy submarine then suddenly emitted flames and smoke and quickly submerged. Then, a loud explosion was heard, and the ship submerged even deeper. At around 4:00 PM, Japanese reconnaissance confirmed that there were many long oil slicks and pieces of wood floating on the nearby sea surface. Therefore, the sinking of the submarine has been confirmed.

### Zhejiang in the Past Two Months (2)

— Bo Ying

### Epidemic Prevention and Hygiene

It is now summer, and epidemics are prone to raging, which has a major impact on society. The provincial government attaches great importance to this, and in order to plan ahead, the Zhejiang Provincial Epidemic Prevention Committee has been established to be responsible for promoting epidemic prevention work in Zhejiang Province. Personnel were sent to Shanghai to purchase a large number of vaccines and transport them to Hangzhou, and distributed them to the Hangzhou Municipal Government and various county governments to implement vaccinations. An epidemic hospital was also planned to be built in Liangzhe Mountain. Other provincial hospitals related to health have also been strengthened and improved to meet the needs of the people.

### Strengthening the Management of Local Products

Zhejiang's local products have always been known to be abundant, selling to various parts of Southeast China and as far as North China. They are a major source of wealth for Zhejiang Province. After the incident, due to transportation issues, the transportation of materials has gradually returned to the smoothness of the past. Mr. Ding is deeply concerned about the movement of materials. In order to develop Zhejiang's resources and encourage the transportation and sale of Zhejiang's local products to various places, he has strengthened management. Starting on June 1, four local products, including medicinal materials, porcelain, mountain goods, and straw mats, will be managed by the Zhejiang Provincial Local Products Management and Handling Department. Starting on July 1, consultation with the Allied forces will resume regarding military-related oils and fats and other raw materials, ferrous and non-ferrous metals, bamboo, wood, firewood, meat, and vegetables. Six types of local products, including categories, are also managed by the office. The circulation of local products and materials in Zhejiang Province will become smoother due to management, which will benefit the people's economy to a significant extent.

### Promoting Agriculture

The Greater East Asia War is now in a decisive phase. It is an urgent task for our country to implement agricultural development. When Provincial Governor Ding took office, it was the time when locusts were about to rise and cause harm. In order to protect farmers' produce, he strictly ordered all counties to implement locust control measures to prevent locusts from harming rural areas. Given that there are many gaps along the railway line that are wasted, he ordered the counties along the railway to earnestly encourage the public to use the gaps along the railway line to plant miscellaneous grains, in order to increase agricultural production. Specialist technicians are sent to provide guidance at any time, and considerable results have been achieved. Also, beekeeping is a common side job for farmers. He ordered the counties of Hangzhou, Jiaxing, and Pinghu to encourage people to raise bees and protect the bee houses that have been constructed. In order to promote agricultural production, the various agricultural institutions under the Zhejiang Provincial Government were adjusted. For example, the Provincial First Agricultural Experimental Field was renamed the Hangzhou Agricultural Farm, the Provincial Nursery was renamed the Hangzhou Nursery. Other provincial Second Agricultural Experimental Fields are revoked and handed over to the Jiaxing County Government for safekeeping. A technical office was established within the Department of Construction to be responsible for planning facilities for increasing agricultural production in order to achieve practical results. The office is currently planning to cultivate 400 acres of farmland in the counties under Hangzhou's jurisdiction, and the rest of the counties will hand over the cultivation to the local cooperatives.

### Building Highways

Zhejiang's highways have always been very developed. Since the incident, they have been damaged by the war, resulting in either the entire highway being unable to be traversed, or even if it is possible to drive on them, it is not smooth. Transportation is severely hindered, and travel is extremely painful. Mr. Ding believes that highways are extremely important to people's lives, economy, and transportation, and he has strengthened the highway institutions, changing the original Highway Management Office into the Zhejiang Provincial Highway Bureau. He also serves as the director of the bureau to promote the effort with determination. At the same time, four highway management offices have been established: Hangzhou-Fu, Hangzhou-Shan, Hangzhou-Yu, and Hangzhou-Wu, to handle road protection, road maintenance, and related management matters. Highways that are currently being repaired include the Hangzhou-Fu Highway, Hangzhou-Yu Highway, Hangzhou-Shan Highway, Hangzhou-Wu Highway, and the Zhejiang section of the Sujia Highway. The Hangzhou-Shaoxing Highway, Shaoxing-Zheng Highway, and other roads are also being planned for repairs. The initial construction cost reaches 50 million yuan. If they can all be completed, Zhejiang's transportation can be restored to the heyday before the incident.

### Rectifying Water Conservancy

In recent years, water traffic has been blocked, so merchants and people's goods cannot be delivered smoothly, and people feel deeply pained. The water conservancy in Zhejiang Province has not been repaired for a long time, which not only affects irrigation for farmers, but also hinders transportation. After Governor Ding took office, he actively engaged in rectifying water conservancy in the province. In terms of institutions, the original Zhejiang Tanggong Water Conservancy Bureau was abolished, and the Zhejiang Provincial Water Conservancy Bureau was established separately. The Director of the Department of Construction, Lin, was appointed to concurrently serve as the director, responsible for sorting out the water conservancy business in Zhejiang Province. Currently, he is planning to dredge the Xiatang River in Hangzhou County, Puyang River, and Xiaoshan Xianghu, etc. Once the plan is completed, the dredging work can be implemented. Other rivers will also be constructed in stages. The Zhejiang Tanggong Supervision Office has also been established, and merchants have been recruited to repair the ruined seawall outside the South Gate of Haining with the "Hao, Jue, Zi, Du" numbers. Construction has now started and is expected to be completed after the autumn floods. (To be continued)

### Governor Ye Discusses the Overall Situation of Governance in Nanjing

Nanjing, 5th (Central News Agency telegram)

General Ye [blank space], Governor of Hubei Province and Director of Pacification in Wuhan, arrived in Nanjing from Wuhan a few days ago to meet with Acting Chairman Chen to report on his work and request instructions. A Central News Agency reporter, in order to understand the current situation of governance in Hubei Province, visited him yesterday. The following is a summary of his answers: (Question) Since your Excellency took office as Governor, what improvements have been made to the governance of Hubei Province? (Answer) After being ordered to govern Hubei, my sole purpose has been to stabilize people's livelihoods and cleanse officialdom. After my arrival in Wuhan, the prices of goods in Wuhan were equivalent to those in Nanjing. However, after the provincial government took action, the prices of goods in Wuhan are now about 10% lower than those in the capital, and people's lives can be stable and worry-free. As for cleansing officialdom, I started by improving the military and police, guaranteeing the salaries of civil servants to stabilize their lives, and then strictly legislating laws and regulations, based on the principles of "nurturing life" and "nurturing integrity." Any civil servant who is not honest will be severely punished according to the "Regulations on Punishing Civil Servants for Embezzlement." (Question) Recently, enemy planes have frequently bombed Wuhan. What plans does the Governor have for the city? (Answer) Pained to see Hubei Province attacked by enemy planes, I convened a fundraising conference in Shanghai and other places, raising huge sums of money to provide relief to disaster victims, improve air defense facilities, and request the central government to issue Wuhan Reconstruction Public Bonds to rebuild the city and restore factories, in order to quickly restore the city of Hankou. (Question) Since your Excellency took office as Governor of Hubei, what are your impressions? (Answer) After arriving in Wuhan, I observed that the spirit of the people is extremely uplifted. They have a considerable understanding of China's wartime environment. In particular, the allied authorities in Wuhan have spared no effort in assisting Wuhan's governance. Local friendly forces have provided even more support. On behalf of all the people of Hubei, I express my deep gratitude for this.

### Allied Press Reporter Comments on the Three-Power Declaration

Tokyo, 4th (Central News Agency telegram)

Regarding the Potsdam Conference, a reporter from the Japanese Allied Press, He Shangyong, broadcast a commentary in Tokyo on the evening of the 3rd, criticizing the conference as a victory for the Soviet Union. He said that the Soviet Union could now handle Germany more boldly. The main points are as follows: The Potsdam Conference communiqué is merely an appendix to the Yalta Communiqué. The difficult issues concerning the future of Germany, such as the Rhineland, Ruhr, and food supply, have not been resolved. The consistency of governance methods is only dealt with by the phrase "to the extent possible in practice." The results of the conference are all boilerplate language, and it is difficult to find a single phrase or sentence of free idealism. The joint statement is actually just to appease American and British public opinion, which demanded that the Soviet Union fight against Japan.

### Laval Defends Himself, Denies Military Cooperation with Germany; Petain Requests Rescheduling of Trial

Lisbon, 5th (Central News Agency telegram) According to dispatches from Paris: Former Vichy government leader Laval appeared as a witness during the twelfth interrogation of Marshal Petain yesterday, vehemently defending his past policies with the phrase "it had to be done this way." When the court asked him how he obtained thousands of French workers to supply Hitler's wartime production, he argued, "This move was also out of necessity. I exchanged 300,000 French laborers for 100,000 prisoners of war. What is wrong with that? At that time, Belgium had established a government under Zhu, and had to supply 80% of the country's labor force to Germany, while France, because it had a government, only supplied 18% of the country's labor force to Germany." At the same time, he vehemently denied that Petain had telegraphed Hitler when the Allies attacked Dieppe, seeking French troops to help Germany repel the Allied attacks or landings. Laval claimed, "I strongly opposed any military cooperation with Germany." However, Petain's defense lawyers insisted that the telegram was not sent by Petain, but that Petain only signed it. Therefore, when the telegram was sent from the Vichy government, it was noted "Petain signed." When the court asked about North Africa, Laval claimed, "This is General Darlan's business, and has nothing to do with me. He ordered the French army to resist and repel any attack from any side, so the French army clashed with the Allied forces." When the prosecutor asked about the issue of handing over Jews to Germany, Laval replied, "I restored the nationality of the Jews." At this time, Marshal Petain suddenly requested that the court reschedule the trial, as he was exhausted. Thus, the trial was interrupted again.

### Negotiations on the Tatar Strait Issue Reach Impasse; Turkey Refuses Territorial Concessions to the Soviet Union

Stockholm, 5th (Central News Agency telegram) According to news from London, the joint communiqué issued by the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union after the Potsdam Conference made no mention of the future of the Tatar Strait, indicating that the new treaty of friendship between the Soviet Union and Turkey has reached an impasse. Although no authoritative sources have released information, reliable sources report that the Soviet-Turkish negotiations, which began in early summer, have not yet yielded results and were suddenly interrupted a few weeks ago, because the Turkish government has refused to make territorial concessions to the Soviet Union. Moreover, it issued a statement a few days ago, stating, "The Soviet government's proposal to revise the regulations of the Tatar Strait should not exclude other countries with vested interests, and should not be decided unilaterally by the Soviet Union and Turkey." Currently, diplomatic circles in London believe that the success or failure of the Soviet-Turkish negotiations depends on whether the major powers can reach a proper agreement on the Tatar Strait issue.

### Nehru Advocates Building a "South Asian Federation"

Bailleron, 5th (Central News Agency telegram)

According to news from Kashmir, Indian Congress leader Nehru stated at a meeting of the Kashmir National Conference (a pro-Congress meeting in India) that he wanted to organize a "South Asian Federation," including India, Iran, Afghanistan, Iraq, Burma, and Ceylon. He claimed, "Our Indian Congress has always opposed dividing India into several small groups. Currently, for economic policies and national defense plans, we hope that India can become a unified home, because all small countries have lost their place in the world of tomorrow. The so-called small countries are actually satellites of the moon, and are nothing more than hunting grounds for big countries. If India is divided again today, it will inevitably perish. In today's world, there are two great powers, ×× and the United States. In the world of tomorrow, two great powers will be added, namely India and China. There will definitely be no fifth great power."

### Egypt Demands Withdrawal of British Troops

Bailleron, 5th (Central News Agency telegram)

According to dispatches from Cairo: Egyptian Prime Minister Bashir recently proposed to British Ambassador Kilronan that British troops withdraw from Egyptian territory. This request was publicly announced yesterday.

### Ministry of Social Welfare Adjusts Personnel Structure

Nanjing, 5th (Central News Agency telegram)

In order to streamline the structure and improve administrative efficiency, the Ministry of Social Welfare adjusted its internal structure last month.

### 20th Air Defense Day: Implementing Baojia Training; Each Lianbao to Use Bicycles for Messaging

The 9th of this month is the 20th Air Defense Day. In addition to expanding publicity on air defense awareness as usual, the Municipal Civil Air Defense Headquarters will change the methods of air defense training. Taking each police station as a unit, it will implement a general mobilization training for the police officers of each station. Under the command of the station chief, various comprehensive air defense trainings will be carried out. The first section will manage liaison and other businesses, the second section will be responsible for security, rescue, firefighting, and fire prevention, the third section will be responsible for verifying deaths and investigating damage, and the fourth section will be responsible for collecting information, providing first aid, relief, and Baojia affairs.

Mobilizing Baojia

At the same time, a general mobilization training of Baojia will be implemented. Each air defense district will take its sub-district Lianbao as a unit to carry out initial training in fire prevention, shelter, and first aid, as well as communication and bicycle messaging. The Baojia mobilization training units will establish liaison offices at simulated disaster sites to command and control relief affairs. At the same time, they will communicate with the various sub-bureaus and the air defense section through communications and bicycle messengers. Therefore, each Lianbao unit should organize a Baojia bicycle messenger team to be responsible for liaison between the simulated disaster site and the sub-bureau. Each sub-bureau will organize a police bicycle messenger team to be responsible for communication between the headquarters (air defense section) and the sub-bureau.

Messenger Training

The police bicycle messenger training for the headquarters and sub-bureaus is temporarily scheduled for the following seventeen sub-bureaus: Huangpu, Lao Zha, Xin Cheng, Jing'an Temple, Jiangning Road, Putuo Road, Hongkou, West Hongkou, North Sichuan Road, Tilanqiao, Yulin Road, Yangshupu, Taishan, Lujiawan, Changshu Road, Huashan, and Changning Road. Detailed measures for various trainings such as light control and traffic control will be announced in the coming days. However, regional comprehensive trainings will be temporarily suspended from this session onwards.

### Houses Damaged by Air Raids Should Be Prevented from Collapsing to Avoid Casualties

On the 27th of last month, a two-bay building at 63 Jiangxi Road in the Central District suddenly collapsed at the front of the building. The cause of the collapse was found to be the shock caused by a previous air raid. Fortunately, the Construction Bureau discovered it early and prevented traffic, preventing injuries. According to a spokesman for the authorities, in the future, in the event of an air raid, the Construction Bureau has instructed special attention to be paid to houses damaged by the shock. However, the urban area is vast and it is difficult to keep a close watch on everything. It is hoped that citizens will pay attention at all times and assist in identifying problems. Once discovered, they should immediately report to the nearest police station and the Construction Bureau so that preventive measures can be taken in time to avoid accidents. At the same time, old and dilapidated houses that have not been repaired for a long time should be repaired properly to reduce the risk of collapse and ensure public safety.

### Dispersed Individuals Applying for Cash: Processing Begins Today

In order to eliminate the malpractice of discounts and convenience citizens who are dispersed returning to their hometowns, the Central Reserve Bank will hold applications for cash and remittances for those dispersed returning to their hometowns at its West District and South District offices starting today (6th). Anyone who is dispersed and returning to their hometowns can prepare a Baojia movement certificate or a certificate from a dispersal agency, certified by the Baojia section of the relevant police station, and with a special guarantee from the bank, and apply to the two offices for cash or remittance. The application for cash is limited to one million yuan per person, and the remittance is limited to two million yuan per person.

### Secretary-General Luo Donates Gold Watch for Air Defense and Disaster Relief Expenses

Since the city has been repeatedly attacked by enemy planes, many innocent civilians have been killed and injured. Enthusiastic people from all walks of life have donated money or medical supplies for relief. It has been learned that Secretary-General Luo of the Municipal Government specially donated his personal gold watch to the Municipal Civil Air Defense Headquarters yesterday to supplement the city's air defense and disaster relief expenses. After Director Noguchi of the department personally accepted it, he made a brief statement to the city's press, saying that Secretary-General Luo has always been as fond of the people as he is of his own children. After the recent air raids, he personally went to the disaster areas several times to comfort the victims. This time, he donated a gold watch to use its value for future disaster relief expenses. This kind of benevolent spirit is truly moving to the department. It is hoped that enthusiastic people from all walks of life will follow in the footsteps of Secretary-General Luo and enthusiastically contribute, so that even small contributions can make a big difference, and the beneficiaries of the disaster victims will definitely be significant.

### Recording Residence Permit Numbers to Prevent Loss

### This Newspaper's New and Old Aid-to-Study Students Held Screening Examination Yesterday; Over 5,000 Candidates with Good Order

The screening examination for the ninth session of this newspaper's reader aid-to-study fund for new and old students was held at Datong University on Xinzha Road yesterday morning and afternoon. A total of about 5,000 students from universities, colleges, high schools, junior high schools, and elementary schools took the examination. They were able to arrive at the venue early to take the examination. From this city, there were residents from Pudong, Hudong, and various districts of Huaxi Fahua who rushed to the venue in the morning. Students returning to their hometowns for the summer vacation also returned to Shanghai in advance to participate in the screening test after seeing the report. Therefore, the number of absentees was very small. From this, it can be seen that the eagerness of poor students to learn is commendable. The two examination sessions were divided into more than 20 classrooms, adopting a mixed system, that is, students of all sizes were seated together, and the order was orderly. In the afternoon, it rained, and a breeze came, making it feel cooler. At four o'clock, the second examination session, for university colleges and junior high school first and second grades, was seated according to the number, listening quietly to the examiner's instructions, each relying on their test questions, pondering hard, and answering one by one, and were able to hand in the papers on time. Overall, the entire process of the two examination sessions yesterday was very good. Datong University is located in the west district, quiet in the bustling area, with fresh air, and the school buildings are magnificent and well-lit. We are very grateful for the willingness to borrow it. Yesterday, more than 40 teachers from Datong Affiliated High School, Municipal Elementary School, and this newspaper's voluntary elementary school served as proctors, enthusiastically supported, and guided well. The colleagues of this newspaper express their infinite gratitude.

### The Origin of August 8th Father's Day

Prominent figures in this city have initiated the establishment of August 8th as Father's Day. The origin is as follows: "Recalling that when the First European War ended, Ms. Jarvis of the United States initiated Mother's Day to console the mothers of those killed in action. Subsequently, enlightened individuals in various countries actively promoted it, transforming it into a day to commemorate one's own mother. There is no difference in this sentiment across all places and times. However, the father gives birth to me, nurtures me. Zhang Hengqu inscribed the grace of Father Heaven and Mother Earth, and Liu Jizhai recorded the virtue of his father's worries and his mother's hardships. Father and mother should be mentioned and valued equally. Knowing the father but not knowing the mother is a loss of basic human emotions. Knowing the mother but not knowing the father is a painful matter. We, the undersigned, considering the conclusion of this Second European War, were reminded and initiated Father's Day, designating August 8th of each year to be observed respectfully, hence also called the 'Double Eighth Festival.' The two 'eights' connected resemble the character '父' (father) in shape, and its pronunciation is similar to '爸爸' (baba, dad). Considering the name and its meaning, it aids in remembrance. The ceremony imitates the precedent of Mother's Day. All children wear flowers in remembrance. Those whose fathers are alive wear a red flower, and those whose fathers have passed away wear a white flower. Showing love and respect, the red love shines brightly forever. Grief over the loss of a father, the honorable family tradition remains. Who doesn't have parents? Who doesn't have children? The wind arises upon hearing this, surely it evokes sympathy. It is hoped that social progressives will advocate and promote it, from one family to one village, to one county, to one province, to one country, and to the entire world. Repaying kindness and respecting parents, near and far, should be one. This is what we hope and pray for day and night. This is the beginning.

Initiators: (Names in order of stroke count) Shi Zhifu, Yuan Xilian, Zhang Yiqu, Mei Lanfang, Lu Ganchen, Chen Qingshi, Fu Wenshou, Fei Mu, Gu Huiquing, Yan Duhe."

### Several Necessary Measures Under Air Raids

— Shizhou

Since July 17th, this city has been subjected to four consecutive air raids by American planes. The scale is far greater than in the past. The central, eastern, northern, northeastern, and southern districts have been indiscriminately bombed. Many civilian houses have collapsed, and the number of civilian deaths and injuries has reached several thousands. In the future, American planes will undoubtedly continue to attack. Under this severe threat, it is hoped that all necessary measures that can promote the safety of citizens can be completed in the shortest possible time. The following points are suggested to the relevant parties to take immediate and swift action to implement them.

Order all major buildings and relatively strong public places in the city to accommodate as many pedestrians seeking refuge as possible after the air raid alarm is issued. Closing the doors is prohibited. Special self-defense teams should be organized on the second floor and above to guard against criminals mixing in and causing trouble. Violators will be punished.

Reiterate the previous order that all shops and residences along the roads should re-apply strong paper strips in a crisscross pattern. Shops with row of planks should immediately install row of planks after the air raid alarm is issued to prevent flying debris from shattering the glass, increasing the number of injured pedestrians.

The air raid shelters dug along the streets in this city are often filled with garbage and stagnant water. Once they are officially needed, citizens will inevitably be near the trenches and unable to escape. Therefore, the authorities should quickly order the workers to be responsible for cleaning up the trenches and complete the work as soon as possible within the specified time limit to facilitate temporary emergency use.

Encourage evacuation and provide affordable and convenient access for citizens leaving Shanghai. Stipulate that all Shanghai residents who evacuate and leave Shanghai can obtain a certificate from the local Baojia authorities and purchase train and ship tickets with a travel agency draft. The draft can be guaranteed by a familiar business or organization before the passenger leaves Shanghai.

Guide citizens in some areas who are unable to relocate to organize special air defense and rescue teams as soon as possible, and provide essential medical supplies such as cotton, gauze, bandages, red medicine, diluted iodine tincture, etc., at low prices. The items are stored and managed by the Baojia authorities, who will send personnel or convene trainings on their use at any time. If they are not needed, all of them should be returned to the authorities at the original price.

With the promotion of the municipal authorities, a broad rescue system should be organized jointly by the city's major hospitals and transportation automobile associations. Each district should respond to each other. If an accident occurs in one district, the nearby agreed districts should automatically come to assist so that the injured can receive immediate treatment in the shortest possible time without worrying about the injuries worsening or even dying innocently due to prolonged time.

Give special preference to the affected people. All affected people who hold a travel agency draft and obtain a written certificate from the nearby Baojia authorities may go to the Central Reserve Bank or the designated agent bank of the Central Reserve Bank within three days of the incident to exchange the draft for cash at full value to provide emergency expenses for the affected people after the disaster. The Central Reserve Bank is responsible for providing the cash, but the amount of exchange should be specified, with a maximum of $500,000 in principle. Additional amounts may be requested for special circumstances.

### Those Evacuating by Vehicle Should Advance the Ticket Check-in Time

— Wu Zemin

Recently, air raids have been frequent, and citizens are automatically evacuating. However, transportation by ships is inconvenient at present, and 19 of them have switched to railways to transfer. Therefore, train passengers are very crowded. At this time, the work of China Railway employees is the same as in the past. There are no emergency measures in special times to assist the authorities in the evacuation plan. For example, the Shanghai-Hangzhou line early train departs at 7:30, and the ticket office often starts checking tickets as late as 7:15. Excuse me, how many passengers can be admitted in this short 15 minutes, so those who are behind cannot get on the bus, and the ticket is invalidated. Three of my relatives and friends have encountered this. Please imagine that evacuees at this time when train tickets are rising in price and difficult to purchase cannot withstand such a blow in terms of mental or economic aspects. So hope

Those with tickets must find a way to get on the train. In case of excessive crowding, priority is given to changing to the next train, and the ticket is still valid, without any stamping procedures, so as to avoid inconvenience.

The station gate is opened at 6:00 in the morning for passengers to enter. After entering the gate at the ticket office, there is no need to queue up again. You can go to the ticket office at any time and directly enter the gate to get on the bus or wait for the bus.

If the above methods can be implemented, those with tickets will not be unable to get on the bus due to the short ticket check-in time, and the order of the station must be better.

### Public Utilities in This City Should Be Jointly Controlled by the Government and the People

— Mu Yun

Shanghai's public utilities—including electricity, trams, telephones, tap water, and gas—were managed by the municipal authorities in terms of fees and administration before the war. Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, various public utilities have been placed under military control. It was not until July of last year that military control was lifted and operated by various companies in Central China. There are other institutions to review the fees and administration, which are not subject to the control of the municipal government.

Recently, due to soaring prices, public utilities have also adjusted prices and increased deposits. In total, there have been as many as three times in the seven months of this year, each time as high as two or three times. As for the service, the insolent attitude of the staff, the low efficiency of the service, the improper restrictions, and the slow repairs are all facts that everyone sees. Recently, due to the issue of bill discounting, various companies have also refused to accept checks. Although some of it can be said to be unavoidable during the war, most of it is due to poor human planning.

We are not opposed to raising prices to maintain war work life or soaring materials, but we want to know whether the application is reasonable in terms of operation. For example, in terms of materials, whether there is any waste, in terms of funds, whether the distribution is appropriate, in terms of personnel, whether the handling is appropriate, and whether the restrictions are reasonable.

The relationship between public utilities and citizens is no less than that between the municipal government and the people; on the contrary, because citizens rely on public utilities such as water and electricity for their daily needs, their relationship is closer than that of the municipal government. Therefore, we advocate that public utilities should be controlled by the municipal government or organizations organized by citizens, such as the Municipal Advisory Committee. At the very least, in the midst of the municipal government's efforts to eliminate corruption and increase administrative efficiency, we hope that the authorities of public utilities will pay attention to whether the actions of their staff are law-abiding, honest and loving, and whether there are any violations, then the people of the city will benefit a lot.

### Use the Peace Shrine Base to Rebuild a Monument

— Hong

August 1st of this year is the second anniversary of the takeover of the concessions. I remember that during the one-week anniversary last year, the Municipal Standing Committee held a groundbreaking ceremony for the construction of a monument on the Bund of Nanjing Road, but it has not started construction after a year. Naturally, the funds and materials have become problems.

Therefore, I respectfully suggest to the municipal authorities and the Municipal Advisory Committee: Please stop building the monument pavilion and use the base of the Peace Shrine on the Bund of Dasha Hai Road to build a monument. All the surrounding area can be engraved with commemorative texts, which is magnificent and long-lasting, and at the same time can save defense power and manpower.

It is not unprecedented to renovate and utilize buildings. For example, the monument built in Beiping during the Gengzi Eight-Power Allied Forces to commemorate the German minister who was killed was later rebuilt as the Allied Victory Monument of the First European War. The anniversary monument built by the Restoration Government on Zhongshan North Road in Nanjing was also changed to the Greater East Asia War Memorial. I hope that the municipal authorities will adopt these humble opinions, then I will be very grateful.

### Several Hotels as Hospitals for Disaster Victims

— Riyong

Someone suggested on July 20th that the country 　舞　廳 should be changed to a hospital for disaster victims, which is very good. However, I think it is better to change the hotel to a hospital for disaster victims than to change the dance hall to a hospital for disaster victims. Because the hospital must have bed equipment, the dance hall does not have this equipment, so I advocate that it is more appropriate to change the hotel into a hospital for disaster victims.

Speaking of Shanghai's hotels, they have long lost the original intention of "housing businessmen" and have become the source of all evils. You see, prostitution, gambling, opium, and other crimes, don't they all happen in hotels? So, changing Shanghai's hotels into hospitals for disaster victims will not only bring infinite benefits to the disaster-stricken people, but also make Shanghai's prostitution, gambling, opium and other crimes lose their base, at least making Shanghai's society can get some time of tranquility and peace, who dares to say it is inappropriate!

In addition, the tea servants in the hotel are originally doing the work of serving and serving. It is not good to make them unemployed one day. If they are changed to hospitals for disaster victims, they can do the work of serving patients, and they can not lose their jobs. At the same time, they were originally doing humble servants' work, and now they are changed to the sacred work of serving patients. Isn't it increasing their status and personality?

I am not helping the zao dance hall. Under today's circumstances, the dance hall is just a sales place for upstarts and has no benefits to the society at all, but his sins seem to be smaller than the hotels. Because he does not have equipment that can be used as a hospital, so I suggest that it might as well be changed to a refugee shelter. I hope that the social people will unite to promote the realization of my proposal, then the society is fortunate!
